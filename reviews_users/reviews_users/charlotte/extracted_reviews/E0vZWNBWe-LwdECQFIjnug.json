    "text": "Stopped here for lunch during a recent visit to Charlotte, based on it's close proximity to Ikea.  I really enjoyed the pulled pork barbeque sandwich with mashed potatoes (and for $5.99 at lunch- it was a steal!).  Hubby wasn't quite as impressed with his meal, he ordered the B.F.W. combo (burger, fries, wings).  Burger was barely lukewarm and they gave him their regular wings instead of their \"best in the area\" smoked wings, which were just average.  But what we really liked about this place were all of the homemade barbeque sauces they offer with your meal (the sweet & spicy one was fantastic- I wish they'd bottle and sell it).  Service at the bar was friendly but a little slow (hence the almost cold burger), but in their defense it was New Years Day before noon.  I'd like to come back on a warm day and enjoy their waterfront patio.  Even with the less than stellar burger/wings, we definitely wouldn't rule it out when on that side of Charlotte again.  Those sauces can make anything taste good!",

I don't feel like it's a very good all night place but they do have a cheap special if you want to stay in the area.  Awesome wings, fantastic crap queso dip.  They also have some good pasta dishes or a regular burger.  Lunch special always 6 bucks which is a great deal!  They also just started serving Landshark which was fabulous so get a Landshark, some wings, sit outside and enjoy the breeze.",

The food, I'll say, is surprisingly good...especially if you're comparing it to other bar food.  The fries and BBQ sauce are especially good, but each of the times I've come here I couldn't have a conversation with the person sitting next to me because the music has been to loud and the crowd trying to rise above an already deafening noise level.  Probably good for people who like to silently stare at each other and get drunk, and good for a bite to eat if you can sit outside, but otherwise the food doesn't compensate for the bad environment...at least for me.",

    "text": "I am a out of town business owner who brought my employees in to Boardwalk Billy's for dinner and drinks after a referral from the Hilton where we were staying. We arrived and order drinks while looking over the menu. We ordered appetizers and dinner. Two of my employees ordered mango mojitos. They were overly sweet and full of gritty mango puree. The ladies alerted the server and she asked if she could get them anything else. They ordered two different drinks as well as another round for the rest of the table.The manager then came over and told us your drink policy and restated the fact several times that the reason was because \"we are a college bar\". We also mentioned to her our appetizers came out after our food arrived and I had to ask our server, who clearly forgot about the app, if we could still get it. After leaving our table your manager went directly to the bartender and was clearly talking about us in a derogatory manner. This is so incredibly unprofessional and unwelcoming. We decided it was time to leave and cancelled our drink order. We still took care of our server as it was not her fault there is a ridiculous policy. Later In the evening a fellow colleague of mine wanted to treat us to a nightcap and talked us in to giving Boardwalk Billy's another chance. We got to the door and heard the bartender yell from behind the bar \"those girls are bitches don't let them in\" to which the bouncer said \"your blacklisted\". First off I am in my mid thirties and a woman not a girl. Secondly it is so unacceptable to call us bitches, especially yelling it across the restaurant in front of fellow business colleagues and my employees. If this is acceptable behavior from your employees it bewilders me that anyone would spend time here. I have alerted the Hilton of our experience and let them know you are just \"a college bar\" and they should be very careful sending business professionals there as they may be treated poorly. So much for southern hospitality!",

It's nice and big on the inside as well, which makes it easy to accommodate a large group.  The foods are nice and fried and greasy, kind of standard bar fare with an emphasis on seafood. The crowd tends to be a little older most nights, which helps keep it a little more subdued. It's kind of like a college bar for the 25+ crowd. It's a good alternative to a lot of the other chains in the Sardis area, and there are always good specials, especially for lunch.",

While the food is very good and the outdoor dining is the best in town, nothing beats being greeted like an old friend and valued customer.  It makes our day when we are greeted by Sadie who always has a big smile and a high energy personality that just lights a person up.  Amanda is awesome as a server.  The glass is never less than half full and she always remembers the little things such as additional bbq sauces for the bbq sandwich.  Barrett is the new GM and we have seen a huge difference in not only the food but also the staff.  We eat there a couple times a week and have always been taken well care of and leave totally relaxed and well fed.",

When we asked our server what the drink specials were, she said she didn't know and would go check.  She came back and told us Yuengling was on special and there was some sort of frozen drink on special.  I was interested in the frozen drink and asked more about it. She again had to go inside to ask what the frozen drink was.  When I ordered it, she told me that it was $5 (when I got my receipt, it was $6.50, which I let slip because I was ready to go). We finally ordered, and although I made some adjustments to my order, it was nothing complicated (I'm a server myself).  She had a lot of trouble understanding what I was asking for and was clearly hungover. Our food was less than memorable and we had to wait for more time than necessary for our check. I may give the food another try, but I'd definitely request a different server.",

    "text": "Ah, Boardwalk...how you've changed. Used to go here all the time. Then, they moved from the little hole-in-the-wall storefront to the big, impressive one diagonally across the walk. And they suffered. Had friends down from NY who *always* went there during race week, and they will never go back. Gave it some time, went for lunch during school, and liked it once again. Went Monday night after my 2nd shift, and it was AWFUL. You know it's been a bad experience when the best part was the bouncer checking your ID. The Hostess wasn't at the door and we waited....and waited....and waited. The server on the floor was too absorbed in breathing to acknowledge our presense, even when addressed. In 4 words, she blew us off. Soooo... off we went to the bar. The bartenders were very nice; the bar was very dirty where we sat. For a place with less than 12 patrons, it was ridiculously loud. But... no hostess meant we sat at the bar. Did I mention the server that blew us off? She had tables come in AFTER we sat at the bar, so, no, she wasn't closing the dining room or going off duty, both of which we considered. Food was OK, not in the rave category. He had a blackened chicken pita, and I had the coconut shrimp. I think mine was better than his, but... His came with regular fries, and I asked for sweet potato fries- both were cooked correctly, but ruined by way too much salt. Way.Too.Much. Orange sauce was thin, but tasty.  My disappointment stems from the buildup I gave my guy on the way to the restaurant. He'd have been happy with The Wine Vault, but I insisted that he'd like the food and atmosphere at the Boardwalk better. My mistake.",

It is located within a nice shopping area north of Charlotte (near UNCC).  The food is standard bar fare with a definite leaning towards seafood.  I had the fish tacos with mango salsa and they were delicious.  They have drink specials every night of the week and tap beers are affordable every day ($3 for Yuengling).  They seem to have a regular line up of live music.  It feels like a good spot to grab a few drinks, an affordable meal, and relax for a while.  The wait staff was all female (from what I could tell) and super sweet - referring to me as \"honey.\"  The crowd is diverse - a mix of ages and ethnicities.  Nothing too special about the place (besides the pond) but still a solid option!",

The salad was a salad, but the boil looked great and the sample I had was delish! It was a MOUND of food, seriously. Probably a legitimate 2 pounds of corn, potatoes, sausage and shrimp with a dusting of an Old Bay type seasoning. After this experience, I decided I should go back when I could eat like a cow and really try the place on for size! The BF and I returned on the following Saturday. We were able to get a table outside and were ready for the real trial. The service was slightly above average and the beers were cold. I got the pork plate and he got the pork and ribs. It was so good. The pork was tender and melt-in-your-mouth good and the ribs were literally falling off the bone. The sides weren't anything remarkable, but were definitely good. The ambiance is great and the food is pretty good. All in all, a good place to check out if you're in the area.",

Staying at the Hilton for business I didn't have much choices around, so with that I came to trusty yelp to see what was the go to in this restaurant. I was actually surprised and intrigued that the Owner Mike was so involved so I was totally excited to still eat here. I read the Mojitos were something Billy's was known for so I went with the House Mojito. Which I just say was watered down even after adding an extra shot in the drink. So I would totally not recommend this to anyone. I also had a Sunday brunch favorite Bloody Mary of course and lepta just say the drink should have been named a Virgin Mary because there was no vodka in it. As an app I got fried pickles and it  was totally salty. Next let's get to the Mac and cheese which was quite bland with the buffalo shrimp which was the best thing on the menu that I've tried and to even that was subpar. The one thing that was great was the customer service by Bobbi she was really awesome and understanding so Billy's great work in that department at least.",

The food was up to par, the ambiance was great but the service not quite.  We had a large party 25 or so people. The two servers weren't in sync and when it was time to leave , it took an extra 45 mins to pay because they didn't sort the tickets appropriately.

The inside is clean and has adequate spacing between tables making for a nice dining experience. It can be a little loud but what else do you expect from a college restaurant.  Food:  I ordered the Buffalo wings touted by Boardwalk Billy's as being the \"best in Charlotte\". I wouldn't go as far as to say that but they were quite good with a nice crispy crust and and a flavorful sauce. The real standout of our meal was the \"Crab con Queso\" dip, a crab dip made with a cheese base with a slight spice to it, absolutely loved it.  Service:  We had a new waiter but I guess even the new waiters at this place are good. Our drinks were never empty and he wasn't intrusive but always made sure we were okay every so often.  Definitely would recommend to a friend! Only downside is that it's a little rough on the wallet if you're on a college budget.",

The menu has your normal bar food, but has some seafood options as well.  There are also peanuts that you can munch on while waiting for your order.

    "text": "Was in the UNCC area for the first time with a couple friends in which they took me here for dinner. Place is located right on the lake so outside seating had a really nice view when we were there, nice and breezy, sun was setting which gave a really nice feel to be here. Granted it was a Sunday afternoon, the restaurant had a large amount of customers dining. As for the menu, typical bar food.   Some friends ordered a dozen half-shelled oysters. Quite good I have to say. Plump, great taste and didn't have a seafood smell. I would've preferred if the oysters were a slightly more chilled, but that's a personal preference. They were a good size and went down smooth. So if you're a fan of oysters, I'd say try it.   I personally had the mahi tuna taco with a side of apples. The quality was alright at best. I can't rave much about it as a friend had the grilled shrimp tacos and I must say those were better. With the mahi, it's served in a flour tortilla with diced tomatoes, slaw, pico de gallo and cilantro lime sauce. Just add a twist of more lime and I say it's a decent meal to wind down too. Not overfilling and not heavy also.   Another friend had an order of crab cakes which I would've rated 4.5 out of 5. Nice flavor and good texture. I think it was a tad heavy on the breading which takes away from the crab flavor, but to each his own. He loved it, so it works out.   There was also a order of perfect sunset fish bowl that was ordered. It came in a short plastic pitcher almost which was interesting. Personally, I don't drink alcohol but this thing didn't even have the taste of alcohol as if it didn't have any at all. Couple sips and I mainly tasted pineapple juice. Maybe the alcohol is at the bottom? Stirred around a bit, nope. Still all juice. Kinda disappointed on this one.   But if I were to rave about one thing this restaurant, would be the service. I forgot to ask for her name, but she was amazing. While seated outside on the patio, she checked up on us frequently, made good recommendations, and joked around. It made the dining experience that much better.   So my first experience with this restaurant and the city of Charlotte was very positive. I'd come here again.",

The rest of the nachos were pretty typical, over salted, over cheesed...but still quite good. My friend ordered the fish and chips; I ordered the fish and chips with shrimp. Shrimp was ok, but the fish was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! It was light and the flavor was amazing! The kids ordered the chicken baskets for kids, nothing amazing but they loved the chicken fingers. :o)  I cannot rave enough about that fish though! I have yet to have fish that light, and flavorful!   Service was lacking, but I don't think we had a seasoned waitress either. The service is why it got 4 stars instead of 5.   Price was great for what we had. It was $65 for the 4 of us. Not bad at all! Would so go there again and again for that fish!!",

The place was empty and you could hear a pin drop until 10pm, when an awful DJ started rumbling the place. Turns out not all domestic drafts were $1 off -- only the shitty light beers. My beer can chicken was so dry that I could barely swallow it without choking. Steamed broccoli tasted like seafood, literally. And they forgot to add bacon to my friend's BLT.",

I'll start by saying the service was slow and the food was... eh. The drinks were decent, although I think I would have enjoyed them more if they were a tad bit heavier on the liquor. The basket of peanuts was a cool touch. It was something to munch on while we waited what felt like forever for our food to arrive.   Once it did arrive, it was \"ok\". We ordered the ultimate steam pot and the private party. The former was said to have been cooked in a garlic and white wine broth. The flavoring was bland. The butter that was served with both dishes must have been unsalted. It seemed watered down and had no flavor. When you eat steamed crab, while crab legs are good, the butter adds for that extra flavor. Not here. Won't be back.",

    "text": "Update: The business responded and again attempted to discredit my accusations.  Either way you look at it, this location sucks.  I went to the other Boardwalk Billy's and enjoyed myself they were a lot nicer and their point of sale was able to accept my credit card payment unlike yours.  Also with regards to your comment about me being Elite that's so childish.. me being Elite has nothing to do with the way you treated me so nice attempt to sway the attention away from your blatant disrespect and highly egregious lack of customer service.  Job well done.  If you love being belittled and talked to like you are a child then this is the place for you!     Also just a heads up the most recent food inspection score I could see they were cited for personal cleanliness before.  The complete detail is available.  After already being seated for about 20 minutes and the other person in my party having a few beers, Aaron the server decided to come to my table to tell me that and I quote \"since we are getting busy and people are coming in, turn down your music or turn it off\"  All the while the music on the patio is blaring something talking about demons and I don't stand for that.  I asked for the manager and Aaron got an attitude and told me \"for what because I told you to turn the music off\" I said yes you are absolutely right.  Aaron came back outside and told me that the manager was busy and he'd be outside to speak with me in a little while.  I waited for over 15 minutes for the manager \"Dustin\" to come outside.  In the meantime I spoke with the only other customer outside on the patio with us, they said they had no issue with my music and couldn't even hear it.  Dustin then finally came outside.  He came outside seemingly cocky and said what can I do for you.  I explained the situation as described.  I also told him that the only person outside with us said they didn't have any issue with my music nor could they hear it.  I explained that the music playing from the restaurant was too loud and we didn't want to hear it since there was objective material not fit for the whole family playing.  Dustin told me that he wasn't changing or turning the music off or down and that this was private property and that's the music they play and if I had a problem I could leave.  At the time I had food from across the boardwalk because Boardwalk Billy's point of sale system was unable to read my payment method.  Since I couldn't order food from here I went there.  Dustin proceeded to tell me that since I wanted to complain that I needed to get rid of my food from the table that it was a healthcode violation, I told him that was fine since I was done anyway.  He stood there and asked me again to throw it away as if he was going to wait there the whole time until I performed the task for him as if I was his slave.  There were still paying customers in our party.  All the while no other customers were sitting outside on this patio.  As I finish this complaint submission we are the only customers sitting out here.  I'm appalled that you allow your employees and managers to act in such an unprofessional matter.  They literally told me that if I didn't like the way they ran their business to leave that it was private property.  I can promise you this, I will never set foot into a Boardwalk Billy's ever again and this experience is a shining star example of why I don't patronize this establishment.  Since you all want to talk about violations I'll also go ahead and file complaint with the Mecklenburg County Health Department and Code Enforcement because I watched some of your employees go and touch ready to eat food without properly washing and sanitizing their hands.  I'm not going to be disrespected and belittled in front of public so your managers can feel better about themselves.  I asked for Dustin's supervisor and he brought me out a comment card and told me to go on there to write a review.  I did not ask for a review/comment card.  He obviously did not want me to reach any higher than him since he thinks it's okay to treat customers in a disrespectful manner.  Since I was refused the proper contact information for upper management I decided to follow through with further action.",

It was uncomfortable watching and listening to our server who is just a young girl who showed up to work today be berated by these guests. If the servers offered anything other than a discount they were yelled at with an audience. Never once saw a manager. I watched this happen with two different tables. You're catering to the wrong customer when you discount the check for a fake complaint. Those people will be return customers who spend a fraction of what the rest of the guest paid on the patio.

The best thing this place has going is its location. There's a beautiful corner overlooking the water and plenty of outdoor seating. However, if you sit out front, you constantly get the whiff of smoke from the smoking area being right next to the tables.   As for the food, well, I could have done just as well pulling the same items from the freezer. I had the coconut shrimp, and there were only maybe ten-twenty coconut flakes for all ten shrimp. There were other menu items that sounded good, but nothing looked over the top amazing as it came out.   Drink specials, they've got those, but after that and their location, they really dropped the ball on food. If only they kicked it up, just a smidge, I feel like there's great potential.",

    "text": "I had a great experience at Boardwalk Billy's. We were looking for somewhere good but not a chain place after a long drive into town. I was pleasantly surprised given the ratings were lower here on yelp.   I ordered the ribs with fried green tomatoes and baked beans. He ordered the BFW (burger, fries, and wings). We shared a Mac and cheese. Everything was great, so great I asked the waitress to find out what was in the Mac n cheese. Got a recipe so that will be my next culinary experiment.  The four different sauces for the ribs were run-of-the-mill but not spectacular. The south cackalaky and the western were my faves. A good  beer selection, including some tasty local ones.   Overall, a good experience, pleasant staff, good food. One drawback was the peanut trash on the floors from the peanuts on each table weren't really cleaned up. However, that's barely worth the mention. I would definitely return. In fact, I'm tempted to break a rule and go to the same place twice in one trip.",

    "text": "Truly a University Area Classic...  I've been coming to Boardwalk Billy's (or B-Dub's or B-Walks) for years, and its good to know that this place has lasted long enough to become a must for any UNCC student looking for a good time.  PROS:  *Above average bar food. The chicken tenders are awesome!  *Great drink specials almost every night of the week.  *Plenty of outdoor seating available, with splendid views overlooking the pond/lake.  *Service is very friendly, and willing and able to chat it up with you if you like.  *Free, all you can eat PEANUTS!  CONS:  *Parking can be tight, esp on Thursday nights.  *Usually there is a $5-$10 cover on Saturday nights.  They say it's because they usually have a band playing on Saturday nights.  Screen game is well below par, and not good for watching big sporting events.  *Also they don't carry any fights or special packages such as MLB or Sunday ticket.    NEUTRALS:  *HEAVY COP presence throughout the parking lot.  *Strong UNCC/college presence on most nights.  *Bar can be tight on their bigger nights.  Boardwalk's is a must if you are looking for local flavor within the University Area.  However, if you are not in the University Area, don't make any specials trips to go to the University Area just for B-Walks.",

My friend, Pat, and I were given food that was not what we ordered. When our server was searched for near and far, she was no where to be seen. We mentioned the mix up to another srever and they took our food to the kitchen. Soon after, our original server came marching up to our table pointing at what she wrote down for our orders, claiming that there was no mix up. After telling her what we (Lois and Pat) wanted (again) she went to the kitchen and brought back our food. The rest of the time she was a big meanie and made us feel bad about correcting her mistake. I hyped up Billy's to my friend, Pat, and was so excited to share the experience, but we left with a little bit of hurt feelings and a frownie face :(",

First we had a bar tender on a Sunday night who didn't pay a group of 4 people getting multiple drinks any attention.  Then the next day my boyfriend noticed an extra charge for the tip on one of the bills.  He called and complained and didn't need anything out of it but a manager said to come back they'd have a gift card for him.    So two Sunday's later we went back. Ready to give it another chance.   The manager was too nice and gave us the gift card. It was the same group of four people at the bar for drinks.   Same bar tender.... Who made delicious drinks this time and was super personable and fun to be around.... Until he talked to another manager.  Which was really sad because he was doing a way better job than last time.  Delicious drinks and way more attention. Maybe the other week had a bad day? You never know what another person is going through.  But then hmm talked to a man who was another manager who told him we needed cut off after our next round of drinks.    There were 4 people.  Two couples.  Both bills around $50 and 4 people willing to continue to give our business because we were enjoying the bar, the environment/atmosphere and the drinks.    They cut us off.  With around $50 checks with mixed drinks that cost about $7 or so dollars each? That's about 3 or 4 drinks per person.  No reason to be cut off.    And from now on they have lost my business at that location.",

The restaurant was large with plenty of seating. We elected to sit outdoors. The seating was great and plenty of shade.   The menu was vast. I had shrimp tacos, corn on the cob and mac &cheese. I liked the corn on the cob best. The mac & cheese was just ok. I also enjoyed the tacos. Everyone seemed to like their choices. The parking options were good. You have a short walk over to the restaurant and you can take a walk around the boardwalk after to burn a few calories. The bathrooms were clean, the restaurant was spacious. Our waitress was nice, she was very helpful with menu choices. I'd visit again.",

I'm so tired of going to places that gives such crappy service that even it affects the rest of your meal, which BTW the burger came out well done bc we weren't even sure if we could choose a temp since our server never asked. Train your servers to smile a little more and to be more attentive, that's all I ask.",

So 5 of us were seated across the restaurant in a booth. We were annoyed that we couldn't sit near or even talk to the rest of our colleagues but we decided to just deal with it. Once we got our bills, we noticed that we were charged an 18% gratuity for being in a large group when we didn't even sit by them, order food at the same time, or leave at the same time. Supposedly the manager could not take the mandatory 18% gratuity fee for service that was already sub par.

I would suggest asking for old bay seasoning on the side if you order steamed seafood. The crab cakes were very crabby which was good. The crab queso was also delicious. I don't drink alcohol but they do have a ton of drinks that look amazing. I would definitely recommend this place & will bring any visiting family or friends there as well.",

Probably this just isn't the place you want to hang out at on a weekend or for any special event.",

    "text": "Boardwalk Billys has been a landmark for me as a UNC Charlotte Alum for quite sometime. Used to come here pretty regularly as a student and the drink specials were always good for a guy trying to scrunge-by on nickel and dimes.   Now-a-days, as it still close to \"the office\" I find myself wandering in here now and then for lunch. Now, the food was never bad before, but for whatever reason I never really ate here. But in any case, I was fairly impressed with the quality of what I ordered- Jerk Chicken Pita. It really hit the spot. Others at my table also had pretty decent meals off their lunch special menu. It is definitely worth coming out for a trail run of this place.  The atmosphere is great, nice interior with large bar. It is right on the man-made lake area and has an outside deck that protrudes the water. Great for nice weather days/ nights.   I'd imagine they still have local talent come out on the weekends, playing covers of decent songs. Drink specials have probably increased with the times since I've drank here, but I'd assume they are still competetive.",

This place obviously does not care about preserving its customer base whatsoever.The worst part is that I wish I had this experience sooner so that I could have stopped going here sooner and they wouldn't have gotten as much of my money as they did. Hopefully they will get better management and make some serious changes at this place.",

We had dinner here around 8pm on a tuesday, and it was sad to see how dead the area looked, even though it was a nice scenic view.   We shared the \"Southern Nachos\" that had smoked pulled pork, cheddar jack cheese, pico de gallo with cilantro lime sour cream sauce drizzled over the top. And of course, I added jalapenos.  This plate was soo huge, even for the two of us. I definitely recommend sharing with at least 4 people, otherwise, by the time your entree gets there you've filled up on nachos. Nothing wrong with that, but you'll miss out on the fabulous BBQ.   For my entree, I ordered the \"Q Combo\" which allows you to choose from their 2 or 3 smoked delights & two mouthwatering sides. I chose the link of smoked sausage and the 4 bone mini-rack. The sausage was good but not memorable. The mini ribs were fall off the bone which is great however it was lacking in flavors. I needed to drench it in bbq and hot sauce.   Overall, I thought it was a great casual place for the family.",

The girl bartender who's pregnant kept giving me and my boyfriend dirty looks all night, we had a total of 5 drinks (me) and 6 drinks (my bf). We were there since 10pm so we had a drink per hour until about 12am when we had two drinks. We also had one shot each and bought some for the band that was playing (amazing group!!!). The pregnant bartender then decided to grab all the other girls that were bar tending and started talking about me and my boyfriend in front of us. I guess she \"thought\" we had too much to drink since I was laughing with my boyfriend. There were other much drunker people around. My advice is if you go there and she's bar tending just sit somewhere else, she gives horrible service and I will not be coming back after that.",

Lunch there in the spring was good.  I had a fish sandwich and we enjoyed sitting outside near the boardwalk.  What a nice feature!  Good service, good food, and good times.  Someone else tried the fried pickles and someone else enjoyed the fries.    Last weekend my sister, Mom, and some friends stopped by for late night drinks and snacks.  Great drink specials!  I enjoyed $6 Grey Goose and Cran drinks and the others enjoyed a few beer specials.  Mom ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and subbed steamed veggies for fries.  Not bad for 10pm!  I ordered 6 steamed oysters.  $7.99 was definitely steep for me in terms of pricing, but I really wanted them and thankfully they didn't disappoint!  Others ordered sandwiches with fries and all said the fries were terrible -- my sister's were barely cooked....so no-go on those.  Sad.  Service was good though.  We never felt \"abandoned\" as you do in some bars, but were taken care of very well.  Open mic night was also going on which we enjoyed.  We'll probably hit it up again next time we're in town since my sis and her friends enjoy it so much.",

I explained I was British and didn't have to bother with that sort of thing. Nice bouncer with a sense of humour let me in and I enjoyed my meal and a few beers.  Why they gave me a wrist band when I wasn't in hospital eludes me.  Tonight I wander across again and am asked for a $5 cover.  None last night but $5 tonight.  I explained that all I wanted was something to eat although I did fancy a few beers as well. Ok. Says my nice bouncer friend who recognised me from last night. Go on in but you will have to get it to go.  Being a cheeky little 60 year old I snuck a beer whilst my food was prepared.  There were twice as many seats as the previous night and the 6 bartenders were serving no one.  My food arrived and I left.  Tastes good but no beer. My question to the manager or owner is who came up with this?    2 additional comments.  1 There was no live music playing which could have possibly justified the cover and  2. Why was o not ID'd tonight. Had North Carolina overnight declared it legal for 60 year olds to drink in its bars.  Had common sense prevailed   I wait with baited breath for an answer.!",

I especially liked that there were 4 distinctly different sauces for the smoked meats. Eastern (more vinegar), Western (tomato based) and South (strong mustard influence). I eschewed the Sweet & Sassy as it's generally not for me.  The setting is great with an outdoor patio (too cold tonite)overlooking a nice pond. All in all - a bodacious dinner for me.  I will add that the prices are very kind to the wallet.",

Normal bar food but it hits the spot every time.  Looking out at the water and the ducks in the lake from the patio is always a pleasant experience.",

Now whenever I have visitors, it will definitely be a place I will suggest we go and eat! You can go here with anybody, the atmosphere is great. We went on a Friday night and we had a 30 minute wait, but it was definitely worth it. You know it's a great place when they have courtesy peanuts to snack on! I got the smokehouse wings and they were phenomenal. One of the cool things about going out to eat is everyone can get something different so we can try many options! I highly recommend giving it a try!",

I paid 2 dollars extra for flavorless sausage slices. It came with 3 oysters, which I'm not sure why because I could eaten each one with a toothpick since there was literally no oyster in the shell. We also ordered the crab con queso dip which was what I can only assume to be a melted chunk of velvita with crab chunks in it. My wife ordered the shrimp tacos which were pretty good which is why I was so disappointed that my boil was so bland. I'm sure the actual meat they serve like the brisket etc is probably really good. So the next time I go back I will stay clear of the rawbar menu.",

The fried green tomato was bland and mostly all core so was very hard. The flounder was fried in a bland flour and just shy of burnt.  The shrimp had the same treatment causing the shrimp to be over cooked.  The sangria was a nice fruit punch with no berry garnishment and I couldn't swear if there was any wine or not.

    "text": "I put off going to Boardwalk Billy's for a long time. We purchased a Groupon last March, but it didn't expire until this April, so we've been pushing it back in order to use other Groupons that expired sooner. Now with April fast approaching it was finally time to see what ol' Billy had to offer.  Boardwalk Billy's is located in that...boardwalk-esque area set up in the University area. It is a nice location being right near the water, and there is plenty of space to wander around in order to walk off your meal and drinks. There were some nice outdoor seating options but it was a tad too chilly to do that, so we ate inside. I was surprised to find there was a fifteen minute wait at 6:00 on a Saturday, simply because this was one of the first times we've had a wait at a restaurant since moving down here. It ended up being shorter, and we were eventually sat.  Boardwalk Billy's offers the tableside peanuts so you are encouraged to chuck your shells on the floor. We partook of the nuts (keeping our mess in a neat pile on the table) while perusing the beer menu. There were probably close to twenty beers on draft to choose from, and most were either local or national microbrews, which is always refreshing to see. I went with NoDa's Hope Stout ($4) and the missus had the Big Boss Countess ($4.) After the beer arrived we placed our dinner orders, and it arrived shortly after. The menu is pretty solid, with choices ranging from BBQ to seafood to plain ol' sandwiches and burgers.   First thing I want to mention is that Boardwalk Billy's looks like your typical bar/hangout spot. What I didn't expect was to find the food was far better than what you would expect at such a place. I ordered the four bone rack of ribs ($9.99) and they were some of the best I've had down here. The ribs were not heavily sauced so you got more of the smoke and natural pork flavor, which was awesome. There was also a nice \"crust\" on the exterior of the ribs, and that bark was nice and crispy while the meat underneath was succulent, moist and flavorful. For the sides I ordered a salad ($1.50 upcharge) with balsamic dressing and mac & cheese. The mac & cheese was not the best, but not the worst. The consistency and texture were spot on, but the flavor was a bit lacking and mild. On the other hand, the salad was the star and totally worth the upcharge. This wasn't a cheese side salad...this was a real salad. It comes in a huge bowl and had some mixed greens, diced tomatoes, carrot slices, crispy croutons and...BACON!!!!!! I would never expect to get bacon as a component of a side salad, yet it was there and it was chewy and flavorful and plentiful. They definitely didn't skip with the cured pork and it made the salad totally worth it.   The missus ordered the shrimp tacos ($9.99) and they were pretty scrumptious. It came with two big soft shell tacos full of shrimp mango and pico. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the overall flavor was downright tastetacular. As a side she ordered the fried green tomatoes, and these things were crazy good! I don't like tomatoes but I had to try a fried green, and boy am I glad I did. A side comes with four huge slices that are battered and deep fried and served with a tasty sauce. The green tomatoes are so thick and firm that I didn't get that nasty mushy feeling I get from regular tomatoes, and the batter coating was great. The dipping sauce was a touch spicy and complimented the tomato very well. I ended up stealing two of her tomatoes because they were so darn good!  Don't let the look of the place fool you...they know how to cook and serve great food. Sure you can come here for a beer and bar grub, but it's done better than your average bar would do it. The BBQ is some of the best I've had in the area, and I'm surprised to find myself valuing their BBQ over other places I've been to that specialize in nothing but the 'Q. If you don't mind the loud noise and crowds I'd definitely recommend giving this place a visit. I definitely know we will be back!",

She seated us we wait another three minutes for another young female to come over she walks up and asked our drink order. No hi my name is or anything. She brings us our drinks then walks off comes back five minutes later. You guys ready to order. Oh ok we place the order and she just walks off twirling in her hair. She didn't repeat the order or anything. About 20 minutes later another server comes and gives us our food. The burgers and fries were good and flavorful. The only reason it received two stars was because the food was really good. The service sucked for this to be our first time here. We'll try it again hopefully we won't get the same server.",

I've hosted baby showers, going away parties, birthdays, etc. in the private room overlooking the lake. Beautiful setting. 6. Ian and Sasha, two of the best bartenders in the city. 7.

Boardwalk Billy's truly has become a staple in the University area, as well as on the UNC Charlotte scene. The laid back atmosphere and sociable staff always make my trips to Boardwalks the most enjoyable. The restaurant and bar space is extremely functional. There's ample space to move about and people watch as you grab a bite to eat or a quick drink with friends. Speaking of food while you're here do yourself a flavor and try the Buffalo Wings. Your tummy and taste buds will thank you. And if you so happen to have a taste for a spirited drink, Boardwalk's has daily drink specials. My favorite special is the Thursday night special. You and your friends can enjoy \"$2 U Call Its\" while listening to some upbeat mixes from the house DJ. And if you're lucky, you and your friends might catch a glimpse of the local \"smooth criminal\"  (a Michael Jackson impressionist). And what could be more fun than great food, good drinks, and a show?!  So grab some friends and make your way to Boardwalk Billy's for some food and fun.",

There are plenty of big screen tvs showing sports which can be viewed from almost every seat in the place.  There is an outdoor section which overlooks the stream.  It seems nice but the geese might make it a little more trouble than it is worth.    The food is what you would expect from a sports bar.  The portions are huge.  Don't be afraid to select the half-orders, you will receive plenty of food.  The staff is very friendly in a Southern charm sort of way.    Be careful walking in because they serve peanuts in the shell in baskets to each table.  The custom is to chuck the peanut shells onto the floor while a staff member pushes a broom around the establishment.    Oh yeah, be warned this isn't California.  I looked at this rectangular object on the table and it actually took me a minute to mentally register that it was an ashtray.  People smoke still inside restaurants here.",

    "text": "My friend & I ate dinner here on 6/26/19, we sat outside near the front door. We were immediately met with gnats... We ordered drinks, Very Berry Lemonade & a Makers Mark with tea. The Very Berry Lemonade tasted just like cough syrup, after informing me the alcohol drinks were final sale, the waitress offered to sweeten the drink. She did that & it still tasted the same even after adding more sweetener. We ordered the crab queso dip, the seafood boil & peel n eat shrimp (steamed). The dip was good but the crab meat was imitation which I didn't know until we had eaten over half the dip as all the crab meat was at the bottom. The seafood boil & shrimp were good except for the fact there were over half of the shrimp that hadn't been properly cleaned & de veined completely. After noticing this we cute most of the shrimp we could eat in half as the bottom half wasn't clean.   I do feel as if the alcohol sales are final that should be printed on the drink menu (not sure if is or not as I didn't pay attention to that). Most restaurants allow you to change drinks as you're replacing the drink you don't want with something you do want.  The gnat situation affected another table outside as well as they were too waving their hands & arms to get the gnats away. Not sure if you guys spray for that but that needs to be done. I've sat on the backside of the restaurant a week before & there was no gnat problem at all. If you're offering a crab queso did there should be real crab meet & not imitation crab meat especially coming from a seafood restaurant. I will return for drinks but will not order anything off the drink menu instead I will order drinks I've drank in the past at home (whiskey & coke/ginger ale. The updated menu is better than the old menu so that was a good upgrade.",

I was staying at the Hilton, so it was super convenient to have dinner here. My coworkers picked this place and I thought it would be easy to find pescatarian options. I underestimated the south. Not wanting to get a plate of crab legs, my only other option was the shrimp tacos. Turns out they were really quite good! They were supposed to be spicy. I wouldn't bill them as spicy, but they had a decent taste to them. I opted for the broccoli side, which was good, but had salt sprinkled on it. No seasoning, just salt. Wasn't into salt on broccoli and was able to brush most of it off.   I'll consider going back, but due to the limited choices, probably only if I'm staying at the Hilton.",

My counterpart ordered the fish tacos. He said that they were (cool) so that could mean a plethora of things. He's not a foodie like myself so I cant really say if \"cool\" is a good or bad thing.

This place is located near a bunch of shops so we had a little wait but were able to walk around until our table was ready. The restaurant prices were reasonable. I had their oysters and their crab cakes. The oysters were nice and large and they came with all of the accompaniments. The crab cakes were 2 crab cakes each. And they were good as well",

    "text": "I and a few friends decided to go to Boardwalk Billy's University because 5hey had never been. While waiting for seats at the bar, I see an 'off the clock' bartender that has served me many times before. She grabs me, spilling her drink on another employee in the process.  After apologizing and removing myself from that situation, I go to order my FIRST drink of the night. The bartender cuts me off and says 'Oh no, I'm not serving you after that.' He tells me that he has informed the other bartender not to serve us as well.  When I ask for the manager, he comes out with an attitude and tells me it's a 'fee off the clock employees that are drunk and are the problem.'  After I tell him I've only been there for less than five minutes, he tells me I must be 'intoxicated on something and need to go.'  My friends, who have never been here before, get their tabs closed out and are told to leave as well. Their tabs were about six bucks each, and the intoxicated employees were all still there when we left.  I personally have come to Boardwalk Billy's often, even spending my 21st birthday there last year. It's likely to be the last one I spend as this was a terrible experience for myself and my friends.  I've never been treated like this in any restaurant/bar before, and I hope this doesn't happen to anyone again. Sticking up for an employee as a manager is one thing. Coming out with an attitude like that without the whole story is another. Very disappointing.",

My family and I walked around the boardwalk for almost an hour and still hadn't receive a text. Went back to hostess stand, which had a different representative, and she said they already seated my party when obviously it wasn't my party. She acted like it wasn't anything big and said we would have to wait again. We could plainly see there were empty, cleaned off tables that they could have placed us at. It took another 10-15 minutes for them to text me that our table was ready. By that time, we were already on our way to another location.  They texted me three more times that my table was ready. Frustration comes from lack of professionalism and unwillingness to remove themselves from the stool they were perched upon to see if they could fix their mess up or inform management.",

We were initially sat at a wobbly table. Our server fixed that almost immediately. We then ordered fried green tomatoes and coconut shrimp for appetizers and they were delicious. The issue came when we ordered our entrees. We waited at least 45 minutes for ribs, jerk chicken, and salad just to be told that our ticket was lost in the kitchen. We were then told our order would be out ASAP but still waited an additional 10-15 minutes or so. The food was then subpar. My chicken was not well seasoned and was only warm as if it had been sitting. The ribs tasted as if they were baked but the salad was fine. Lol. How can you mess up a salad. We never heard from a manager to apologize or received a discounted price or anything. Devin did the best that he could but we won't be back here.",

My boyfriend had the beer can chicken special and our daughter had the kids shrimp and hush puppies. All of our entree's were really good, definitely cleaned our plates. But the best part was our server Taylor! Phenomenal customer service. She was very upbeat, excited about the menu, and checked on us the entire meal from start to finish. So when you go to Boardwalk Billy's make sure to ask for Taylor, she is the best!",

I have had many cheese dips with crab that tasted fake, but this was rich and tasted fresh. The chips were crisp and fresh as well. The chicken fingers were skinny, but we loved them. I had ranch with them and it was some of the best ranch I have had at a restaurant.   The margaritas were pretty pricy ($11-15), but that is alcohol for you. It tasted good and it was a pretty good amount for the $. I will definitely be going back for $4 mimosas on Sundays!",

It took her a while to come and check on us after we received our food so we were without extra napkins, BBQ sauce and sweetener for our tea for a while. We never received refills until she came to ask if we were ready for the check. The cost was great though. Full meals for two and a crab cake basket with drinks for less than $60.",

Room service was almost closed for the night so we went down to Boardwalk Billys since they were open til 2am.    They checked our ID at the door and gave us wristbands.  We figured this is a hot spot for the University students since UNCC is nearby.  But it was pretty dead on Sunday when we went.  Only the late night menu was available which included your typical bar food: wings, fries, nachos, and other munchies.   We went with wings, crab cakes, and fries since it was already getting late.  Really liked that they had a long list of sauces to pick from for the wings.  We tried the chipotle citrus, which was great with the chicken.   I'd definitely try to come back next time I'm in Charlotte to see this place crackin' and have a few drinks with dinner.

    "text": "I never write reviews about Restaurants. However there is a time to start. First off let me start by saying the wait staff was excellent. Now to why I am writing this review, my wife ordered a drink off of their drink menu, she took a sip and did not like it. So we asked the waiter if we could replace it with a different drink.  Unknown to us there is a policy that if you by a drink you have to keep the drink. So I asked to speak to the manager night. I told him that we would like to exchange the drink. He points to the menu that they have a no return policy on drinks ordered. (lol) Now call me old fashion but I have never been in any restaurants that had that policy. So I told him ok well since you are forcing me to buy the drink. We will pay for the drinks we had and the appetizers and we are leaving. He goes to get the bill and returns saying. \"I did not know you place your order\" you will have to pay for the order placed.  Now once again that is a new one. So I asked where is it written that I had to pay for food that is not bought to my table? He threaten to call the police because we were going to leave without paying for the food.  (lol) I said I am offering to pay for what I consumed. He couldn't answer the question about having to pay for the food. We were asked to leave and never come back.  What I don't understand is this, we ordered over $90.00 worth of food. However instead of reaching an agreement over an $8.00 drink you give up $90.00. I am surprised they are still in business. Wow what an unbelievable experience.  Sorry can't review the food since I never received the food.",

It isn't cheap but most seafood isn't.  The shrimp were spiced on point and the rest of the meal was seasoned well.  I saw that they have live music later in the evening.  Looks like they do charge cover charges at times.  Might want to do call ahead seating or reservations and check on their specials.",

Went to the bar for drinks while we waited on a table, bartenders are less than friendly. But hey, it was busy. We sit outside and 45 minutes pass by while we see several groups sit at available 5tops who put their name on the list after us. I got up to check on the table and hostess says they are just waiting for the table to be cleaned off. 5 more minutes pass and she buzzes us up and points to a table to tell us it's ready. We go to the table and it's still dirty, half of us awkwardly stand by the dirty table and a few sit at the dirty table and the poor busser girl comes and cleans the table around us. No menus for 5 minutes. Update as the meal went on* our server was mehh, barely came around the table and trying to get boxes and checks was a 15 minute wait long after we had finished eating.   I used to come here a lot. Just really disappointed in my visit tonight.",

The tacos were supposed to be soft flour tortillas but came to the table dry, hard and cracking with every attempt to bite.  The shrimp was not seasoned and the slaw lacked flavor.  The low country boil was dry.  Really, food that was supposedly slow boiled came out dry and tasted microwaved, especially the corn and sausage.

So the truth is, I ordered without looking at the menu as I told you. I also told you anyone can have a bad day. SI if he has been there for 10 years, big deal. I still stayed, drank beer and the waitress who took care of me after was lovely. But the couple who was next to me, did not like the mixed drink they got from the same bartender who has been there over 10 years. So he may have had a bad nite or that is your standard of service. I leaned over and told them I had the same issue. They did not drink it and left shortly after. Your philosophy of walking past dollars to save pennies is not the best practice. But, you were not too helpful either. No matter what, I paid for all the drinks I received and ordered. But I have the right to post my experience and I have been honest. It is not a personal attack.

Having been a server consistently for the last four years during college I understand the temptations friends being at a table but you're there to work not socialize.  Once we got the bill we waited another ten minutes for her to come run our card and finally decided to just drop cash on the table and leave.

Even then Billy's was a great place to go for drinks or appetizers.  I think our server tonight was a bit overwhelmed.  He may have had too many tables and kept forgetting things we requested.  For example, my friend ordered an appetizer for the table and he forgot to send it to the kitchen...thankfully it was on the house.  I then overheard him say to a fellow waitress that he had nine tables and he was starting to stress out.  Other than that, the food was good and the company was even better.",

If you are seated and order a drink or appetizer, you are stuck in that seat and may not ask to move, even if it is windy/chilly outside.   Want to ask for the manager? Don't, no help at all; respecting the waiters' and waitresses' rotations and sections is way more important than simply moving from an outside table to an inside table.   I hope the establishment realizes that losing customers by this rule is only hurting the business as a whole (a.k.a. moving a table from a patio waiter/waitress to an inside waiter/waitress is a \"sacrifice\" the business should make in order to maintain customer satisfaction and BUSINESS).   The lack of customer service from the hostess to the manager will ruin the food and atmosphere.",

The hostess advises that we were not on the list (after clearly checking in) and it would be another 5 mins. After waiting 30 minutes, we attempted to be seated. As we walked by 3 available booths. My elderly mother asked the waitress could we be seated at a booth, as she rudely walked away  and turned her back she said there is a waiting list for the booth. I followed the waitress back to the door to ask how long is the wait list. She  made up a time of 40 mins. Everyone we encountered before sitting down was extremely rude. I'm not sure how the quality of food is, but the customer service is pure trash.",

My server came up to me finally , now in all fairness, she was the only one that was tending to her tables.  Since I waited so long I ordered everything at once. Drink - skinny margarita which is still a great drink. App - 1/2 raw oysters, at best they were ok. Dinner- low country boil, at best ok.  I've never had a low country boil served with absolutely no juices in which everything is supposed to be boiled in.  It looked like everything was just put together, not prepared together. I asked for a bowl to put my discarded shells in and was given a pitcher?  All I can say is that it's good that this place is a nice location.  Mike - instead of voicing how you hope that we'll try it again, why not make an effort to make it better?",

I'm not sure if they still do college night, but it's still a good place to visit if you're in the North Charlotte area. The restaurant is located in a  boardwalk area, by the water and other restaurants, so there's always a group, especially on Friday nights. They have a long beer list, large bar area, large patio and ample indoor seating. Great place to watch a game ( large TVs everywhere). My favorite dish here is the Fried Flounder Platter, its seasoned and fried just right.",

I couldn't recommend the place more as both a family friendly environment or a sports bar that serves great wings with a solid beer choices.",

We had fast service even though it appeared to be busy. The Jamaican Jerk Chicken is a very good option. It is a little sweeter than other jerked chicken that I've eaten but still good not too spicy.",

As long as I get served in a reasonable time, I'm content. My gripe is that sometimes they give peanuts as an appetizer and sometimes they don't. I want my damn peanuts ALL the time :-(  The food is nothing spectacular, but it's good for a casual meal. I have never dined in the indoor area. The deck patio over the pond is too awesome to to be cooped up indoors! They also have a front patio area for a view of the Boardwalk traffic.  Dogs can also dine with their owners on the front patio.  There is nothing bad I can really say about Boardwalk Billy's. It has become one of my favorite spots in the area. The atmosphere is casual and welcoming. It is definitely a great summertime spot.",

My wife and I drove up to have dinner with my son(UNCC student) and his three roommates.  They pushed two tabled together and seated up promptly.  Our server, Laken, took great care of us.  She knew the menu well and was able to make educated recommendations.      Our orders all came out correctly.  Laken anticipated the condiments that we may need and had them on the table without us asking.  My pulled pork sandwich was good.  The fried green tomatoes were just okay.  They had little taste.  That's fine because the portion size of barbecue was huge.  Everyone else enjoyed their entrees as well.     The dining area looked super clean.  They displayed a sanitation grade of 96.5.  The atmosphere was relaxed and the view from the large glass windows was pretty.  We all enjoyed our meal together.  Well done.",

    "text": "Im not sure where to start...wait... I got it it,  Myrtle Beach in Charlotte.  I was not going to write the place up,  but thought I owed it to my readers.   ... and it just had too many issues to ignore.    Im not knocking Myrtle Beach,  just trying to set expectations.   If you read my stuff,  you know I try to be fair.   The atmosphere is a super relaxed mixed sports bar and restaurant feel.  Nothing fancy, but meets what I call the \"box on the table\" venue.   We had to ask for our box, with paper napkins, salt and pepper, catchup and mustard.   We called ahead and asked if there was a dog friendly patio to eat on.  We were told yes.     We got to the restaurant to find the \"outdoor dog friendly\" area was a sun exposed smoking pit.  It was okay as we were told they were cleaning off the last semi shaded table for us.     At the same time,  an employee of the restaurant (who was not working) walked up after us and asked for our table.  She got it... and we were sat in the sun... with Pretzel our dog.   I know,  it's my own fault for staying,  but I'm okay with sun.  What else could go wrong??   Well...  As we were in the Mahabi desert,  it was noticeable our waitress was leaving us without water for long periods of time... Im pretty patient,  but it became annoying and went to get my own water.  What became even more annoying was the employee that got our table was getting lots of attention,  and the night quickly turned into an employee reunion at her table.    I think every person that worked there came out and sat with her telling her \"how cute her dog was\"... Pretzel was insulted pretty much the entire evening.  ... and then... I saw it... gum all over his feet, yes gum... I was ready to go, but then the food arrived.    Okay,  food...   it was pretty good.  It was not awesome,  but was high end sports bar food quality.  We had the pork nachos,  they were actually pretty good.  We also had the blackened Mahi tacos which were totally yummy.   Jax had the cheese burger,  which was not good.  It was ball park quality at best.   He's 18 and was hungry and did not finish it.  ...say no more.    Bottom line,  not real expensive, food was okay, but I found the place a bit of a hassle for family dinner out.   If I was a group of college kids,  its spot on.",

The menu has a little bit of everything, from salads, to burgers, sandwiches, and tacos. There were a bunch of drink specials too, but I wasn't feeling well, so I didn't grab a drink today.  It took a couple of minutes for our waitress, Simone, to come greet our tables and get our drink orders; however, once she did, she was super friendly, and also took our food orders as well, since we were ready.  The location is in a shopping center with other shops and places to eat, as well as a lake that Boardwalk Billy's is close to. There are lots of big windows, that give it a very open feeling, so you can see outside and enjoy the view of the lake.  I enjoyed my turkey salad very much! There was a lot of grilled turkey on it, as well as the other toppings. I ordered the vinaigrette dressing, and it was fabulous. Light and it was sweet, but not too sweet.  We noticed as we were eating that tables kept coming in. It's definitely a laid back place. It's in a great location, and I will be back. Be sure to ask for Simone-she was sweet!",

Best of all, the lunchtime prices are fantastic.  I can get a full meal and an iced tea (plus free peanuts in the shell as an \"app\") for less than a meal at a fast food restaurant.  It's a great deal for a great meal and fun atmosphere.  My favorite menu items include the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, Buffalo Chicken Salad, and -- of course -- just regular ol' Buffalo Chicken Strips.  I always order the \"Fire in the Hole\" sauce on any of them.  It's their spiciest sauce.  I used to love the Blackened Chicken Pita, but they replaced that with the Blackened Chicken Tacos, and they're just not as good.  My friend/coworker typically orders the Pulled Pork Tacos; they're a hit.  Boardwalk Billy's is my go-to lunch place.",

The first time we went, it was on a Sat night and the wait was super long, usually a good indication that it's a good spot! Right? A few months later, we came back Friday during the day, 6/14. Once again, a friend recommended this place. I was a little disappointed!  1. Our server was sweet, however she was slow and it took her a while to attend our table.  2. My food was cold.  3. My daughter ordered bbq and thought it was a sandwich, but it was just the neat and it was DRY!!! Mud friend green tomatoes were good. For an app we ordered the Crab Con Queso. It was delicious or we were extremely hungry!  Overall it was ok! Not the best and Ill go back if it's a last option. The area was nice too!!",

    "text": "Boardwalk Billys is a joke of an establishment. For starters, all of the food and cocktails are a ripoff. The prices are extremely high for the small portions of low-quality food. They will send out burnt plates, reuse messed up plates, and make sure you don't buy desert because some employees scoop your ice cream with their hands.   the establishment makes $5 million a year they refuse to take back any drinks, even if a bug has flown into one.  Behind the scenes they're terribly racist.  If a black table sits down, the servers immediately call the table a ratchet table.  Management are literally almost all on coke and don't expect a day at work without hearing some form of sexual harassment.  Overall, don't eat at Boardwalk Billys. The place was designed to drain your pockets of money and not satisfy you. Not to mention, if you're a person of color they don't want you there. The staff is one of the most racist I've ever witnessed. The saddest part of it all of that most of the clientele is black so that's how they make their money. Take back your business.",

As long as the weather is good, highly recommend sitting outside and enjoying the lake view.  Inside is fine but rather noisy.  Menu is diverse.  They have BBQ pulled pork, chicken, brisket and ribs.  Also have some seafood (including oysters) and other chicken dishes.  I'm not a fan of ordering BBQ at a place that doesn't specialize in BBQ, so I opted for the jerk chicken.  Jerk chicken was decent.  I would order it again.  The sides (bake beans and greens) were decent as well.  My dinner companions got the brisket and crab legs.  They were satisfied with the dishes but nothing was a home run.  The raw oysters were good, but the waitress forgot to bring hot sauce with the oysters.  Overall, the food is okay, service is good, drinks are better, and the view on the deck was the best.",

The restaurant itself has plenty of outdoor seating either by the lake or in front of the restaurant. We opted for indoors.   The service was good, food took a bit long to come out but they got everyone's orders right and it was pretty good! If you like spicy bloody Mary's, this is the place for you! I typically don't like Bloody Marys but this one was refreshing.   I got the ribs combo with wings and two sides (fried green tomato and Mac and cheese). I could taste the smokiness on both the ribs and wings - ribs were good but on the fattier side but the wings were meaty and really tasty. My sides were good...didn't blow me out of the water but I like having the wide selection to choose from. I enjoyed having different sauces they offer! I got Fire in the Hole and Spicy Garlic and I would highly recommend.   My one complaint is the ceiling- as I sat at the table trying to imagine what type of stuff can fall into the food.",

I was a little apprehensive at first because a lot of the reviews alluded to the idea that Boardwalk Billy's is more of a sports bar type place -- which it is, make no mistake -- but that the food was run of the mill.   We were both in the mood for seafood and were in the concord area, so decided to give it a try.    Turned out to be a great idea!  Short wait for two at 8PM on a Friday (10-15min) so we waited at the bar where we received fast, friendly service and well-made, well-priced drinks.     When we sat down, we were greeted by a very friendly server who answered some questions about the menu, and we ultimately ordered the Ultimate Steam Pot and a low country boil.    Everything was excellent!  The crab was well cooked, everything was well seasoned and the oysters were fantastic!  Price was as expected for two with drinks ($70/Tax and too) and well worth it!",

My expectations were really low. Why? It's a seafood/BBQ/bar food place with tons of variety. This leaves me he question of whether the quality was there.   This places looks like any sports bar, which isn't what I expected before I walked in. The place was very icky maybe from the heat or just dried up beer. I just wanted some oysters to eat since it's pretty much the only place in the local vicinity that would serve it.  My server was pleasant and extremely efficient. I sat down with the menu, and narrowed it down to two in-house specialties and she was quick to help me decide what to order. Typically, I would get waitresses that ask for a drink order and then come back and then ask for the order of food. She did it all at once knowing that I only wanted water. Terrific!   My half a dozen oysters came and it was not only cleaned very well, but shucked smoothly. I couldn't do much better myself. The cocktail sauce on the other hand was sweet and not too sour, which was great because I usually hate cocktail sauce. Ended up drowning each oyster with it unnecessarily. These were good size oysters.  Next came the double sausage I ordered, and everything was perfect, it was tasty like a sausage should be. My only gripe is the ketchup, but being Canadian, I am used to a different kick of ketchup, and know that the US have a different supplier. The restaurant can't change that.   Best part was the bill. Wha? The bill? Yes, checking in for yelpers gets you 10% off and she gave me little to no trouble adding this discount. Go go yelpers! I'll probably drop by one more time before I leave back to Canada.",

I completely understand that Charlotte is no where near fresh oysters, but I've had some good ones in the area. Here... I'll pass. Maybe they get them out of the pond beside the business. The mojito was good and the pimento cheese was good. (Probably because it was palmetto brand) I'll skip this place and drive to Concord for Full Moon. I was also expecting more seafood on the menu, but this is a bar with seafood options at best. Thank you Yelp for the 10% off my bill and 7% cash back.",

So we said okay let's go to the bar, we proceed to walk to the right side of the bar were it's 6 chairs, so the bartender immediately throws two signs on the bar. So it was a couple sitting there and they said oh yes that seat is taken, which was fine. So i proceed to read the sign and look away the rude, unprofessional and nasty bartender says \" i don't know what she looking mad for and walked away. So i am thinking to my self i know she isn't talking to me a \"paying\" customer that way. So i walked out because i knew the end result wasn't going to be nice, needless to say all of us left and went to another place to eat. Customer service sucks and whomever the bartender was who was clearly having a bad night and doesn't like her job needs to either be trained or find somewhere else to work. They have forever lost my business",

The oysters were fresh, not sandy AND they were \"released\" from the shell by the person who opened them. That is a big plus to half shell lovers. I had the Mahi Taco which was excellent and my husband had a burger which he really enjoyed.  The atmosphere was fun, very casual and the wait-staff friendly and attentive.  You should really give this restaurant a try even if you aren't into oysters & if you are an oyster lover you owe it to yourself to check this place out!!",

You'd want a taste of the ocean in the oysters, but none was to be had.  Very bland and disappointing.  A steamer platter of oysters, mussels, shrimp, crab, and corn and potatoes was also very bland; and over-cooked.    I'd come back for the drinks, but not the food.

Though they have a variety of fried options, a good burger, and my coworker swears by the Buffalo Chicken Wrap (with Frank's Hot Sauce, Fries, and 2 orders of blue cheese dressing), what will surprise you here is the variety of their healthy options. Instead of fries, swap out for steamed vegetables! They have a ground turkey burger and what is quickly becoming my favorite is their grilled chicken salad with Mandarin oranges, candied walnuts and dried cranberries.  The atmosphere is very laid back with staff in shorts & peanuts in baskets at each table shelled to the floor. On spring days the patio outback is perfect for the mid afternoon office escape.",

(Description included due to the fact that this guy is hurting your business) When I asked for suggestions on what to order from the drink menu his answer was \"absolutely nothing'. After one drink for me and two for the guest I was with he notified that he would only be able to get us \"one more\" due to the \"law\".

I had a carribean jerk chicken sandwich and it was good - there was no spice to it, but it was more flavor that I was expecting! My mom got the pimento cheese burger with fried green tomatoes on the side and it was OK (\"but it's no Pinky's pimento!\" - Mom), too.   There are a good amount of TV's here and a view of the pond, so that's a plus to the locale, but the parking lot was packed at 2pm on a Friday, so parking at night or the weekends might not be a boardwalk in the park (har har har).

My friends and I all used to wait tables, so we understood if he/she couldn't come immediately, so I gave a five minute limit before we decided to walk out. The server had 30 seconds to spare before the five minutes was up (talk about lucky!) before greeting us. My friends and I ordered drinks and split a pulled pork nachos. I had shared some blue bowl drink (can't remember the drink's name). It was really good, with a delicious coconut note to it. However, definitely too much ice. The melted ice diluted the alcohol that it ended up tasting like juice. The nachos were absolutely delicious. The server (can't remember her name) had redeemed herself from the long wait before coming to us. She was funny, friendly, and consistently came to check on us (we were there for a couple of hours).

Of course, as the night goes on, the floor is covered in shells.  I'm not a fan of the bar atmosphere here.  The music is hit or miss.  The DJ/Band sets up near the the back and has a makeshift (small) dance floor.  The music genre on the nights I've been there  is highly variable.  Cover bands, metal/rock to top 40.  The drinks are not very strong but on certain weekday they have some pretty unbeatable bottle/well specials.    The patio on good weather nights is also a definite plus.  Parking during the day is not a problem but on Friday/Saturday night the lot competes with the Wine Vault and Bad Dog.

I had the fried flounder and shrimp dinner and it was delicious both were hot and crispy fried golden brown the corn on the cob was well seasoned and hot. My bf had the Q combo with ribs, chicken and pulled pork the ribs and chicken were smoked to perfection and the pork was very tender. I checked in with my yelp app and received 10% off our total. We will be visiting again very soon.",

We sat at the bar to have a drink while waiting. The tattooed barmaid seemed a bit put off that she had to be working and felt as if she was doing us a favor by getting us drinks. Thank God it was only temporary to have to deal with her as the others in the group arrived not long afterwards. We were seated in the back overlooking the pond and were all surprised at how beautiful the view was. Our server was Alex and he could not been any more helpful or friendly while we were making our lunch choices. Everyone in our party enjoyed their lunch and Alex must have overheard us mention that one member in our party was celebrating a birthday that day as he brought out a cupcake with a bday candle in it.

The wait was not long at all! Our waitress was very sweet. She consistently checked on our group despite the busy crowd that typically flocks a Sunday afternoon.  I don't normally care for bar food and mainly chose this place for the view. The relaxing lake view is always the perfect ending to a long day. I've been to Boardwalk Billy's a few times, but I tried a different dish this time and was pleasantly surprised. I had Grilled Shrimp Tacos, which is mango BBQ shrimp on flour tortillas. I traded one of my tacos for my friend's Blackened Mahi Taco. I got the shorter end of the stick since the Grilled Shrimp Tacos are SO MUCH BETTER! Should have just kept mine, no tradesies next time! ...jk =P Definitely try them though if you stop by!",

The restaurant had a new look on the inside and it was clean. And the food was good. Our server was great too. I ordered the Boardwalk Salad, steamed shrimp and a side of fries. Everything was good, even the salad. I think they also expanded their selection of beers. Not sure when this happened bit they offer craft beers and sours now. And they have drink specials multiple days of the week. So I may be back to Boardwalk Billy's in the future to grab a quick bite.",

They covered it in panko so the crunch was nice but even slathered in their fake-out \"remoulade\" sauce it didnt taste like anything worth eating. For the price I should have known something was up. I ordered the mojito and I have to give them credit for using fresh mint, however it was definitely watered down. The service was good.

There's a enclosed patio sitting over the man made pond & a regular patio amongst the mini boardwalk.   Kayla was our super star server, as she handled all three of us simultaneously & with a smile. Especially in dealing with my old school Newark Godmother, she has no cut cards...if she didn't order Shrimp, don't put them on her plate LOL.    My Mahi Mahi tacos were blackened to perfection, yet a little dry as I was able to consume any of the tasty sauces. Yet, I made my own concoction of Tabasco Sauce & a couple of dressings & was good to go. The Sweet Potato Fries were really on point. Godmother got the Fried Flounder Platter that came with Mash Potatoes, Coleslaw & French Fries. My Goddaughter had the CrabCakes, & we all dined happily in the sun.   Kayla thanks for being a super duper trooper in serving us, we'll ask for you when we return.",

They had a wide variety of sandwiches in their late night menu; I got the cheeseburger and made mine a double with fries. Very basic. It was good, the party was cooked well done, the pickles, lettuce and tomatoes were fresh and they even put fried onion straws I their as well. It was very very good!  I would come here again for sure! It's a nice, fun and relaxing place for a group of people or even an individual to enjoy themselves! I will definitely be back!",

Shared a meal.. just a meal and 2 soft drinks with my partner and my bill came out to $50 plus dollars.. this was the first time that had ever happened and I had eaten that meal 10 or more times and it never came out to that amount.. of course I was pissed and asked to speak to a manager so I did and he had absolutely nothing to say.. and gave me a coupon for $10 off my next purchase $50 or more!!!!

It was so sweet, tasted like non skinny had mostly agave and tasted no tequila. Then decided after my bike ride I was hungry so ordered a buffalo chicken wrap which the server said this batch today is super spicy and since I like spicy that suited me. Then she said oh the fries are typical width and covered with seasonings. The wrap was ok, though not even mild spice. It was mostly flour tortilla doubled over, then the fries , yuck, limp, sad, mushy, and would you believe , no seasonings . Needless to say I ate most of the wrap, none of the fries and was sorely disappointed in the drink. These are not difficult orders or highly unusual. The server asked if we wanted a desert and when we declined she brought the check. I will not be going back and this was my first visit. Terribly subpar food and beverage. I guess since most of the drink menu comprised of pina coladas and frozen daiquiris type sugary drinks, I would have fared better with one of those. It surprises me this place has been in business all of these years.",

I could have not wasted my time and gas and I could have taken my business elsewhere. And the next time your conducting business with a customer tell your piece of bartenders to stay in their place.

Be sure to show up early because the bar fills up really fast, as well as the tables around it! I was there for 4 hours and only spent $16! Oh and I have to mention the delicious beer. On game days you can order a personal pitcher for $5 which if you don't know, its about 2 to 3 beers.  I can't wait to go back again!",

As far as decor the place has a very beach feel, cute ambience, casual and not too collegiate (considering the area). The majority of the customers were also business professionals so that was nice. I may have to come back to try their drinks, they have an extensive beer list and mixed drink menu.",

Our food was great and we had a wonderful visit. Amazing service and great food. Would highly recommend!!",

They're very good wings for a southern establishment. (I hail from Western NY.)  I have always found the service agreeable and accommodating. Each time I've visited for dinner it's been with a bigger group including small children. The atmosphere is loud, so kids blend in. On Sunday's they tag the TVs with team logos, so you know which games are playing where--helps with the seating selection.  It's fun place with tasty food and good drinks.",

One of my favorite parts is the basket of peanuts you can munch on while enjoying your drinks and waiting to order food.   My favorite item on the menu is the chicken pita. The pita is soft, the chicken is tender, and the sauce is spicy and flavorful.   Overall, it's a nice casual place to eat and drink with decent prices.",

First our drinks, frozen margaritas had so much ice you couldnt taste the flavor nor the alcohol. Still was excited to eat. Next my order of smothered fries were cold as if they had sat in the window TOO LONG waiting for our other food to come out. My wings had not kick or flavor to them at all. Everyone else at the table was satisfied with what they ordered aside from the drink issue. What made me so UPSET  was not so much the issue with food. It was the manager Clint. He came to the table didn't introduce himself or ask how can I help you straighten out whatever issue you have . He simply came to the table and said, SO YOU DONT WANT THE FRIES!  He was so rude, nonchalant, and arrogant. I sent my entire order back and waited on my friends to finish there food. I asked a server for you're contact info. Then Clint later approached the table and said I heard you were looking for the general manager and arrogantly handed me a card. Again I  am sadden that my excited experience turned out the way it did. Reached out to the general manager via email and didn't get a response nor and apology.",

My husband got a wings entree which surprised me as he is not a huge wings fan. He absolutely loved it. They were as good a sample of wings as we ever had. Just delicious. I got a smoked turkey entree and it was also excellent.       They have a great beer selection and we both ended up getting Blue Blaze (Charlotte) S'mores Blonde ale which was incredible. More of an amber than a blonde but light with flavors of chocolate and vanilla. One of the best beers ever.       Finally, our server Joe was just fantastic. He was attentive and friendly and just a good person to have taking care of you. We talked about some local happenings and he made sure to bring us a copy of \"Creative Loafing\" ( a guide to Charlotte fun activities) with our check. When we saw the new light rail extension would drop you off right next to this location we got even more jazzed. I can totally see us riding the rails back to Billy's. Just a fun place with great food.",

    "text": "On Sunday 05/25/2014. I was @ the boardwalk just chillin. OK, So, I am on a 30 day green smoothie diet, but while I was over here, I felt the urge to eat. hell, I was hungrier than a pig. This isn't my first time @ the boardwalk, but it was my first time ordering food from Boardwalk Billy's! Now, let me tell you, I know good food when I taste it, and honey, this is garbage.  So about 20 minutes before I leave the boardwalk, I call BB's, and tell them that I would like an order of Smothered Fries and Red Hot Wings. I also specify that I would like the food to be fresh and hot when I arrive. Ok, she says 15 minutes. I give them 11 and go in to get my food. It's already bagged and waiting.  As a native Brooklyn NY boi, born and raised, I expected good food. Sine BB's is always jam packed,. I thought it would be banging! You think so? Hmph!  Now I drove 27 miles on 485 home to unpack my food, which was packaged nicely. The aroma was wonderful and I could not wait to dig in.  One carton had Smothered Fries (Cheddar cheese & Bacon) and the other had Red Hot wings written as descriptions. Ok, so here we go....  The Fries were smothered wonderfully with the cheese and Bacon mixture, but they were ice cold. Certainly not the temperature I'd expect after a 25 minute drive. Warm, yes, but COLD...Hell no! So i took a bite because I was starving, and I didn't taste anything...lmao. so I put them in the microwave for about 30 secs, and drizzled ketchup all over them.  They are still tasteless. YUCK! $9 DOWN the drain  Now, let's get to the \"RED HOT\" Wings. Well, I'll give them one thing. They were red, but sure as hell weren't hot! Either by temperature or by the so-called hot sauce that they were supposed to be drenched in (the description via the menu details this). When I tell you they were just regular wings , made however they make em. so-called crunchy, with  what appeared to be red dried up hot sauce on them. They as well were nasty and tasteless. They smelled of a few days old and re-cooked and the so-called blue cheese sauce was horrible too! if you don't believe me, order it for yourself! So, because I was hungry, I wound up eating about 6 of them. When I got to the bottom of the carton, I picked one up with what appeared to be live hot sauce - I dabbed it in and took a bite. Do you think that so-called hot sauce was HOT? Hell NO! It was like red water. Didn't give my mouth any burn. Just a waste!  Now just because I'm Black doesn't mean anything, but this brother knows good food when he tastes it! And as Judge Judy says, If you eat the steak. it is what it is. But I can't go and ask for my money back. I'm 27 miles away home. The people that think this food is great, are drunk, high AND have no taste buds for flavor, whatsoever!  I wound up throwing the fries and wings in the trash. A waste of $20.00. One mistake that I WILL NEVER EVER, EVER MAKE. NO ONE SHOULD EVER! order food from Boardwalk Billy's! I could have gone to McDonald's and had a tasty meal for $5.00...hahahahahaha!  Even an unsanitary Chinese restaurant that serves chopped up cat & rat, their food tastes 1000 times better than this trash!  Ugh! What a waste of my time. Ugh!",

    "text": "9/17/12-Highlight of the meal was the local beer.  Server brought the wrong app (fried green tomatoes and crab cakes instead of just fried green tomatoes) and after we had already started eating it he showed up with our correct order and demanded that we give him the app. (My companion had already grabbed one of the crab cakes thinking it was a fried green tomato--yes, they were basically the same diameter and general color, just thicker.)   In my opinion you never take something away from the customer that was your mistake and an upgrade.  My concern here is that they are going to turn around and give the crab cake to someone else........In the end, it saved me several hundred calories from a crab cake that was more filler than crab.  BBQ chicken 4/5 Pulled pork 2/5 (bland and tasted like it was cooked several days ago and reheated for service...maybe even frozen ) fried green tomatoes 3/5 Fried pickles great novelty but a one time order 4/5 crab cake 1/5 my companion only took 2 bites and it definitely wasn't top quality.",

    "text": "I was really excited to take my out of town guests to this place. Figured it would be a great atmosphere because it was on the lake. Have been here for lunch before. It was around 9:15 pm Saturday. We were stopped and asked for our ID then told we had to pay a $5 cover charge each because there was a band starting at 10pm. We told the bouncer that we were just in to have dinner. Said sorry it is a $5.00 cover charge. Being that we already made the trip all the way here we paid the cover charge. Never heard of paying a cover charge to eat burgers, but really wanted to sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere.  Oh and no band ever showed up.  Never again. Also, my guest went outside to make a phone call, and at least ten people walked away because of the cover charge.  The place was completely dead, and they ended up losing customers over a $5 cover charge.",
