My husband had a flatbread pizza which looked really good.  I was too into my salad to even ask for a bite before he finished it.    Small space with less than 10 tables, seems like a better place to grab food to go.  Will be back!",

Normally, you are bound to find at least one semi-gross item in a salad; whether it be a rotting piece of lettuce or a slimy spinach leaf...there's always something. The lettuce in my Cobb salad was perfection. Delicious and fresh. They used a fresh avocado and I received a half in my salad, hand cut right before my eyes. The dressing was perfect. Everything was so yummy. The employees were young and when I was there they had a lunch rush- a line of people extending to the door. They were fast, professional, and performed extremely well under pressure. They were friendly with me and my baby daughter and said hello to us as soon as things calmed down. I will be back!  One critique, the shape of the salad bowl was very deep and narrow, making it difficult to eat and get a good distribution of toppings and dressing from top to bottom.",

Everything else is considered premium toppings costing additional for each. The salmon quinoa bowl is sprayed with a thick layer of sysco cooking spray yuck! I don't know why they don't ask you first that stuff is toxic, better option would be coconut oil or olive oil. I had to request them give me new spinach cause I didn't want any spray on it. The girl at the register was not friendly at all however the asian girl was and every table was dirty covered with food on them. Overall i would not waste my money here again easier to go to the store and spend less making your own to your liking.",

The service was amazing. Ivan and Jonathan (I had to get their names because I wanted to make sure they got recognized) were so nice and made us feel right at home. The place is clean and stylish. The food was EXCELLENT! We had the BBQ flatbread and the chicken Caesar wrap on the garlic wrap. Can't say enough about the speed of the service, the quality of the food and the atmosphere inside.  This is exactly what this shopping center needs and our family will be returning soon to try some more delectable bites.   Go give this place a try....we need a place like this to stick around.",

We placed an order for delivery recently: a Crunch Chicken Wrap, a BBQ Santa Fe Salad, a Cilantro Chicken Quinoa Bowl and a Pesto Portabella Flatbread. All exceeded our expectations with the exception of the Flatbread which was missing its cheese and had a meager amount of veggies. Considering it is priced about the same as the first three items I mentioned, I recommend sticking with those categories. We will definitely be ordering from Crunch in the future!",

I noticed that they always have a great selection of unique soups as well.  Not the typical stuff you see a Panera or other sandwich places.    You can't go wrong at Crunch Bistro.

I got the BBQ Santa Fe salad and swapped grilled onions instead of red onions and it was really tasty. I tend to feel underwhelmed whenever I go to Chopt, so I definitely plan to come to Crunch Bistro more often. They had Italian Wedding and Tomato Tortellini soup for the day and while I really wanted to try the soup, I'm glad I didn't because the salad alone filled me up completely. Will try the soup next time though!  Also, the restaurant is pretty small. Very narrow with just a few small tables, maybe 4 or so. I would recommend grab and go, which is what I did.",

The staff was super nice and attentive but as soon as I started seeing the ingredients I knew I wasn't going to like my salad. The kale was kinda yellowish at the ends like the bags of kale were a little old and then the salmon that was going on my salad was literally an already overcooked peice of salmon that was popped into a convection oven before my eyes.  When I ate the salad, it tasted like I expected. The salmon was dry and just not good. I didn't eat most of my salad. My husband finished his kale Caesar with chicken but wasn't so crazy about it that he would go back. I would maybe go back here and have like a vegetarian wrap or something with only veggies.  I would definitely not order anything with meat again.  The prices weren't bad but that doesn't help if I don't actually eat what I bought. I would rather pay a few more dollars and not get a precooked overcooked piece of salmon.",

As soon as I took my first bite, I got excited to leave a review. Best fast casual experience I think I have ever had.  My girlfriend and I were going to catch a movie in Ballantyne and saw that Crunch was just a little ways away, so we decided to stop by. The restaurant is very clean and bright, and the two people that helped me were super nice and helpful.   I got a custom wrap with chicken, romaine, cucumber, onion, pepper, bacon, croutons, and honey mustard. Did I say wrap? I mean BURRITO. This dude loaded me up so hard I felt bad for him trying to roll it up into one wrap. Speaking of wraps, they had wheat, spinach, tomato basil, and one other that sounded great. I went with tomato basil and it was a noticeable difference.  The best thing about the wrap was hands down the chicken. EVERY single bite I had the chicken was charred and juicy. Imagine the best chicken you've ever had from chipotle and then imagine that in every bite you take. Just so damn good.  The guy that served me let me know they have $6 wraps on Wednesdays which is insane. Even if you go on a normal day it's super worth it.  CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!",

    "text": "Come on man! Could this tiny little \"salad joint\" really be as good as all of its five star reviews on Yelp? Well... Yupp! Even at 7:30 on a Saturday night with only one incredibly capable and talented young man named Johnnathan working, the entire place was immaculate, the service was fast, friendly and efficient, and the food was as superb as it was fresh. I'm going to cut to the chase and state up front that this place is indeed a Gotta Try so you can go ahead and head there now. You can read the rest of my review in the car on the way (and you'd be wise to also take a peek at the menu as it is extensive.)  Speaking of the menu, it includes all kinds of healthy stuff served up as salads, wraps, flatbread and grain bowls. My wife and I went conservative and ordered a Veggie Delight wrap and a Pesto Portobella flatbread. The actual wraps themselves are available with white, wheat or spinach flour, which is a nice touch in itself. I opted for the spinach flour and only added cilantro to the wrap's baby spinach, cukes, grilled Bu on Mushrooms, tomatoes, shredded carrots, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, jalapenos, feta cheese and house cilantro lime dressing. It was excellent, as was the flatbread, that included goat cheese, pesto, portabella mushrooms, spinach, fomatoes and parmesan. The total bill ran $22 including two fountain drinks.  With the speed and bravada of a Nakata Japanese chef, Johnnathan expertly prepared our food, was conscientious enough to remove sanitary gloves before collecting money, checked us out, put on new gloves, handled his next customers, and then walked around the small dining area cleaning off the tables and checking on us customers. Very impressive indeed!  The only negative as far as I'm concerned is that the dining area is so darned small. Unless you get one of the two tables in front of the windows, the rest of the tables are very tight. In fact, I felt like I had to shift forward every time someone walked behind me. So, in conclusion, I give the place five stars as a take out option, and four stars for dining in. Either way, like I said earlier, it is a Gotta Try (especially  if the young Crunch Ninja is working.)",

Today, I had a quinoa bowl with picante chicken.  My friend, VP, had a fresh salad that was large enough to feed all of south Charlotte.  My quinoa bowl had a decent amount of delicious chicken in it and was topped by many jalapeno slices. I would order the same dish again, and actually look forward to it.   While we were there, I noticed that there was not a lot of traffic coming through.  The place was very sleepy.   My guess is that people have just not discovered this as an option.  There is no other reason why people are not flocking here:   Good food, great sanitation score, and convenient location.  I hope this place makes it!",

    "text": "What a pleasant surprise! I stopped here after shopping at Trader Joes.  It was the day that all wraps were $6 and I am so glad I stopped.  The wrap was exploding with fantastic, fresh veggies and was one of the best things to pass my lips in some time.  I had the Chicken Salad wrap and the chicken salad was well made and delicious.  I highly suggest you go in and give something a try, as I suspect that everything is as good as what we had. Also, they keep things very clean and it's well appointed, albeit small.  Not great for groups, but perfect for small lunch or take out!",

Breaking down their quinoa chicken bowl:  Quinoa: IF you enjoy quinoa bowls (I know, you have had them 100 X, NOT this good you haven't) their actual \"quinoa\" is excellent!! SOO hearty but yet light, fluffy & airy AND moreover FULL OF FLAVOR! It has to be 1 of the BEST quinoa versions I have to date! It was so crazy good I m  craving it now!   Chicken: Their \"chicken quinoa bowl\" ...O M G, their well marinated moist grilled chicken is  E X C E P T I O N A L !! The chicken spices are on point! How can a quinoa bowl be this GOOD, we were skeptical about how tasty this place would be before we arrived ...once we observed the chef in ACTION we knew we were DEAD wrong! Their priority is FRESH & FLAVORFUL and that's exactly what they delivered.   Citrus lime dressing: This is their MAGIC sauce that brings it ALL together ...request EXTRA as you will be glad you did. I LOVE their particular version as it's NOT overbearing, it allows the chicken & quinoa to continue to shine all the while it just compliments the dish. Perfect balance of citrus & lime!!  Dessert: Banana pudding w/ wafers & banana slices  The chef was so cool he brought my husband & I 2 bowls of their super popular banana pudding on the house. That as well was delicious.   Their \"Bianco pesto flatbread\" was GOOD but in all honesty we preferred their chicken quinoa bowl.   Highly recommend!   ENJOY",

They were very polite and courteous. When I was eating, the manager Raven came to my table to see if I need anything and to make sure I was happy with my food and service. This was great customer service. These young adults gave me better service than other restaurants with older staff members.",

    "text": "Great fast fresh spot in south Charlotte. You go up front and can order a wrap, salad, or flatbread from their menu or you can build your own.  Be warned, the place is extremely small and cramped so not good for groups but makes for a good take out spot. It's always been very clean when I go.  Service was slow today as a new girl was training.    I usually get the BBQ santa fe salad - sub spicy ranch for regular ranch.  There is something about the combination of bbq sauce and ranch that I love!  The salad portions are huge! I usually can't finish the whole thing.    They offer free kids meal on Sunday w/ an adult entree purchase and also $6 dollar wraps on Wednesdays!",

We tried the Cali crunch salad, tomato tortellini soup and veggie wrap. Portions and prices were great.  Can't wait to go back!",

Not to mention the fact that this place is in the same lot as Olive This and Trader Joe's which both are my Sunday go to's .  I had a yummy cranberry and goat cheese spinach salad  which was awesome. My husband had a flatbread which he enjoyed and our son had a cheese flatbread which he enjoyed. Glad we got a chance to check this place out. The process is like a sandwich line, you can see all the ingredients and ask for what you want on your salad, flatbread or wrap. The staff is pretty cool and appear to love their job from our experience as they were happy and helpful which are two great qualities.",

Next time, I am gonna try with my whole family.",

I had the kale chicken caesar salad and hubby had the buffalo bleu salad. We both loved them. The salads tasted fresh and were a generous serving. I like that they gave us the dressing so we could choose how much dressing we wanted but I ended up using it all and could've used even more so it didn't matter in the end haha. I'd definitely go back again and want to try other things on the menu like one of the quinoa bowls.",
