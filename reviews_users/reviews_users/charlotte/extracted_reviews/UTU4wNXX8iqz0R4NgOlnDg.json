It's hidden off of Providence Rd as soon as you pass Fairview Rd on your left. I discovered Phil's Deli and Il Nobe or something like that, an Italian restaurant. I plan to check those out too.   I got the Pad Thai, and it was delicious. Not as big as the Pad Thai from Upstream, but still delicious. Came with an eggroll and some soup. Everything was good, the service was very good and quick. The interior had cute and fancy Thai decor. Very nicely done! Bravo, Thai Orchid.",

We sat out in the covered porch area, which was good because the inner section of the restaurant had a old, stale smell to it.  Otherwise the decor and ambience was fine - it is more of a place for older people, not trendy at all, which is fine by me.  The food was meh.  The spring rolls were plain but fine.  My wife loved both the Thai beer and her coco-milk soup, however my pad thai was cloying sweet, without the acidic notes of tamarind or lemon.  It wasnt bad at all, but nothing special at all.    The service was fine, though the one waitress passed a few times to ask us if we wanted more beer even though our glasses were still over half-full.   It is hard to find in the shopping complex, not right on Providence Road as our GPS was telling us.  If I need a quick Thai fix in the area I might do it again, but otherwise probably not.",

    "text": "The best Thai food in Charlotte.  I have been a customer ever since the owners ran a Thai restaurant on Central Ave.  I used to travel to Asia a good deal and one of my Thai customers visited me here in Charlotte.  I tried taking him to several different Charlotte restaurants, but he always pulled out a bottle of tabasco sauce that he carried with him.  Taking the hint I decided to take him to Thai Orchid and he was extremely impressed.  He ordered all the dishes Thai native spicy and we ate outside in the 95 degree heat. (this was back in the day when they had an outdoor patio).  I would have rather eaten inside, but he was as happy as a clam eating spicy food outside in the middle of July.  He loved their food and said it was the best meal he had eaten since he had been in the US.  Some of my favorites are:  mee krob, squid salad, chicken larb, kang dang curry, green curry special, pad thai and the boneless chicken wings.  The service is very friendly as well -- they don't call Thailand the \"land of smiles\" for nothing, and these folks carry on that tradition.",

The other evening we picked up cold duck salad, crispy fried rolls, Thum Yum soup, and a #38 ginger and veggies with beef. A new low for us. The soup was flavorless; the duck salad was missing the advertised crispy noodles, and the #38 was filling, but boring with limp flavorless vegetables. Plenty of ginger though.

And I don't mean hot as in crowded and covered with paparazzi, I mean they keep the AC at 78 degrees... sit in the main dining room rather than the sunnier side -room to keep from completely melting down- figuratively and literally.

Surroundings are a little contrived and stuffy (think fake village chic), but the interior is comfy, warm, and casual. Service was great start to finish, and we saw an owner (older Thai lady) wandering around, greeting her regulars. Tres cool.  Interesting features: hotpots (they have a large variety of soups, all of which feature veg friendly versions) are served somewhat traditionally, in an aluminum pot built around a sterno insert to keep things warm. A large part of the menu is \"pick your meat\" and accessible to veggies via the tofu option, cool cool.   But the flavors are toned down (I blame that on the obscene rent I'm sure these guys are paying) and even though my red curry was decently hot (of course, I ordered extra extra extra spicy and this was far from it) it lacked the deep level of flavor I eat curries to experience.

As my entree I ordered the vegetarian Pad Prik King with tofu and it was amazing I requested them to make it spicy and they were able to accomplish that! The dish was full of wonderful veggies in a creamy coconut curry sauce the dish came with rice! Normally I get the pad thai but decided to try something different and I was not disappointed! I would definitely recommend this place the staff is also very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly the prices here are also fairly reasonable!!!",

Hubs grabbed takeout from Thai Orchid after a very long holiday weekend..I was itching for something spicy and noodle-y, thus pad thai seemed to fit the ticket. Price wise, our bill for two noodle dishes and an order of their fresh rolls came to $28. Not too shabby and a bit less than my Thai fave Uptown. Since I can't comment on the staff or the ambiance, I'll get right to the eats...  Fresh Rolls: Light, fresh and tasty spring rolls filled with chicken, carrots, cucumbers, and rice noodles, wrapped in rice paper and served with tangy peanut sauce. The menu said shrimp were in here too, but I didn't see any. Maybe it's an option? Nonetheless, they were large, fully stuffed and a perfect healthy start.   Pad Thai: Typical pad thai with shrimp, chicken, green onion and tons o' noodles. I asked for it spicy (not Thai spicy) and it had pleeeenty of kick. Blowing my nose kick. Kick start my metabolism. Flavor wise it's a nice pad thai - not my favorite in Charlotte, but well made and a generous portion.   If I'm in the SouthPark-ish area and jonesin' for some Thai, I'll definitely try Thai Orchid again!",

    "text": "Thai Orchid is an OK Thai restaurant.  The lunch specials are moderately priced and small enough for you to not want to take a nap right after eating.  I mainly get the Pad Thai when I visit because it's usually the 1 out of 4 dishes I recognize on the menu.  I've had better, but it's decent.   Today I was happy to see that they had Pad Prik King (or Pad Prig King depending on the restaurant) on their lunch menu today so that is what I ordered.  Next to the item it indicated it was of medium heat (spice wise) and I was fine with that because I can tolerate some pretty good heat.  When it came in front of me I was happy to dive in!  My first bite started off with a good flavor....until about 3 seconds later when the heat hit.  Holy moly, it was so hot I almost started to cry right in front of my co-workers!  I thought maybe I picked up a Thai Chili by accident in that bite, so I drank some water and had some plain rice to cool down the fire and tried again....MISTAKE!  I couldn't believe how spicy it was!  I couldn't even eat the spring roll that comes with the lunch because the heat (temperature) from the spring roll was only making it worse!  I asked a co-worker to try it just to make sure for some reason that my tolerance for spice today wasn't lowered, but he couldn't eat it as well!  He can sit in front of me and eat a raw jalapeno seeds and all and not even flitch and he couldn't stomach this dish.    I've ordered the Pad Prik King for dinner once and definitely know that it wasn't nearly as spicy as it was today!  It was actually quite tasty and that was why I was excited to see it as a lunch special.  Usually Thai Orchid is ok, especially for a quick lunch and it's proximity from our office, but I really can't see myself coming back here.  Next time I'll stick with what I know and travel a little further to my favorite Thai restaurant in the Dil'!",

This made me more excited for the meal! Located right behind Fresh Market on Providence/Sardis area, the place is small, but cozy. I called in ahead, so I just walked up to the counter and gave them my name. The food came out right away. There is no bar area, so don't plan on getting a drink while you wait for your order.   Ordered Pad Thai, Pad Woon Sen & Fresh Rolls (spring rolls on steroids). All this for $28. Not bad, as I've paid more and less for the same order at other restaurants. Surprisingly, I got a side of white rice too? Not sure if this is typical or a mistake?   Got home and dove right in as I was starving. Food was really good and the portions were huge. Made for great lunch the next day. Ordered both dishes \"medium spicy\" and the Pad Thai came with a little more heat than the Pad Woon Sen, which was fine as the Pad Thai was for the lady.   I'm a fan and will be back again!",

I also ordered spring rolls, got home, and they were both ripped apart and had tofu...menu didn't mention that part! They were a mess (literally) so I took them back and tried to get veggie spring rolls. Apparently your options are either the vegetables with the meat or the tofu with lettuce. If you want the veggies(carrots, cucumbers, etc) you have to get the meat and if you don't want meat you don't get the veggies....makes no sense! My options were pay $5 for something I can't eat/don't like or go without so I asked for a refund.  Lesson learned and I'll stick with Thai House. It's further from my house but I'd rather drive and know the food will be good instead of playing food roulette! $15 for mediocre shrimp curry isn't worth it!",

    "text": "Until tonight, I have never understood my husband's obsession with Angel Wings. For all the years I've known him, virtually every time we've ordered Thai takeout (which was quite often in San Francisco) he's doggedly opted for these weird deep-fried chicken wings stuffed with all manner of whatnot, They've always seemed greasy, bland despite the long list of ingredients, an affront to the explosion of flavor that I associate with Thai food.  Tonight, however, when he took me to Thai Orchid in his old stomping grounds in Charlotte, I finally got it. These were made with a level of love not ever seen before in the fried Thai chicken department. The secret seems to be steaming your de-boned stuffed wings so they stay wonderfully moist, then bathing them in a buttermilk batter before you deep-fry them. Man, they were good.    For my part, I played it safe but successfully with a chicken pad khing sod, which included ginger, mushroom, snow peas, green onions and napa cabbage. It was also very flavorful, just the right amount of ginger.  My main quibble with our dining experience was that they served us way too fast! It's not always a good thing to be sat, served and delivered your check in 47 minutes. This is not necessarily the place to come for a long, lingering dining experience. That said, the people were nice as could be and we'll back back whenever we're next in Charlotte.",

Later I found out that they come here often more as a convenience because they live nearby... Anyway, to break it down, this place is on the expensive side, their portion is also rather small. I don't even think their food is that authentic or super flavorful, which is strange because Thai food is supposed to be pretty heavy on flavor. I do have to give them thumbs up for nice and courteous staffs, this does not come by often at Asian restaurants. They also have a patio like dining area that has glass panels, which I personally prefer because their inside lighting is VERY dark.",

It's really small, but adorable! I felt like I was walking into someone's home.  At 7 PM, they weren't busy; it was a bit awkward for it to be so quiet, even with music playing in the background.  Luckily, Tonya & Billy are foodies like my boyfriend & I, so we sampled quite a few of Thai Orchid's offerings.    Fresh rolls: Heaven on a plate. I am such a big fan of fresh (spring) rolls & these were amazing.  First of all, they were HUGE! Packed tight & full of ingredients. The peanut sauce was spicy & hot & a perfect compliment.  Spring rolls: Just the right amount of crunch & ingredients. The spicy sauce was hot & spicy, too.  Chicken wings: Cooked perfectly & again, the accompanied sauce was yes, hot & spicy!  Tonya & I both agreed it would have been tastier if they tossed the wings in the sauce prior to serving. Maybe next time, we can ask politely. :)  I had the shrimp fried rice, which wow, the medium sized plate was overflowing with rice goodness.  I was a little taken a back due to having tomato chunks in it, as well as the shrimp having their tails still on.  Due to snacking away on appetizers, I was unable to finish my rice, but Shawn will enjoy it for lunch.   Shawn, Tonya & Billy all enjoyed their dishes of flounder, jasmine rice, & Chicken Pad Phed.    Our waitress was nice & checked on us just the right amount.  Our water glasses stayed full.  Like Nicole, I am giving 3.5 stars, but bumping up to 4 for the appetizers & portions.",

If it you want better portions & consistency, this is not the place. Service: I waited until my second time eating here to make my review and this is the conclusion that iv come to.   The service is lacking N HERE's WHY! 1. The workers look at you like you're  crazy when u walk in instead of asking how many ppl and where would we like to sit.  2. I also Noticed that they separate the Caucasian ppl from the rest (non-white), by sitting anyone of ethic background outside when there's plenty of room to sit in doors. Not sure how Asians can be racist or bias to any group of ppl. But I seen it with my own eyes. 3. They never check back with us once the food came out. You have to physically track one of the workers down or go the the desk to and ask for a refill or napkins ect.   Like I said I never like to write a bad review and always try to give the facility to make up for their lack or service, quality of food and professionalism. We all have bad days but it shouldn't be consistent, not if you want returning customers.",

This may be unfair because I have been to this restaurant so many times over the last eight years and I know what I like and what to avoid!  This food is extremely consistent!  Every time each dish is as it was on previous visits.    First I ordered Fresh Rolls! These are the largest Fresh Rolls of any place I have been!  Their \"Peanut\" Sauce is the most unique, House-made for sure, super thin, sweet and sour with minced peanuts on top.  The Fresh Rolls earn 4.5 stars and the Peanut Sauce gets 4.1 stars.  One of my Favorite Thai Dishes (when it is done well) is stir fried Thai Basil with Beef (my friends and I call it Basil Beast)!  What I like about Thai Orchids approach to Beef Basil is the beef is very good, it has very few other ingredients, Garlic, Peppers, Soy based sauce and Thai Basil.  This simple recipe yields one of my favorite versions of this dish!  The Rice is Jasmine I think.  This dish gets an easy 5 yelp stars every time I have eaten it here!!!  For Dessert, Custard with Sticky Rice!  Tastes much better than my photo conveys.  I'm glad I got it though would not order it without a couple of people to share it with and last night I ate it all!!!  I have to keep reminding myself I'm on a diet!",

The selections are typical for Thai food in the America but some I have never seen before or heard of.

Decor could be a bit overdone, but there is an air of elegance and there is always take-out.  Look for the sandwich board and then for white pillars...that's the place.  Prices are a bit high, but the food is OK Thai and the menu covers the typical array of Thai dishes.  Portions are reasonable, but on the small size given their prices.  Their spring rolls are excellent and we usually order a dozen.  They are firmly wrapped and fired just right, without oozing oil.  Their curries are excellent and for those that like the Thai standard Pad dishes, which I don't, you will be pleased.  I like how you can order your dish and then amplify it with beef, chicken, shrimp or have it meatless.    Spiciness is very mild.  I ordered spicy, the two pepper logo, and it was not spicy at all.  Live dangerously and insist on spice and they certainly can melt your inlays, but if you like spice, mention it and ask them to jazz it up a bit.  Sooner or later I will come up with the right-for-me level of spice.  You can dress up here and one will see families so attired, also couples on dates wearing more than t-shirts and flip-flops.

Most of the time, the service is good, but there have been a few misses in this department when they are extremely busy. However, overall I am pleased with the food and service and can overlook the occasional off-day.   They offer several lunch specials which come with a spring roll or egg roll. They also start you out with a small soup of the day which varies.    I really like their pad thai here and often get it when I am here for lunch since its usually one of the lunch specials.  For dinner, I like their curries -especially the Penang Curry.  (I have only had one really bad meal here and sadly I cannot remember what I ordered on that visit, but it wasn't one of my \"normal' favs.)   They season their food for the \"American palate\" so if you like it spicier, just let them know and they will bump it up for you.   The portions are definitely generous, so I usually have leftovers... I love getting 2 meals for the price of one!  :-)",

The food came out hot and fresh and the waitresses were very nice but there was more to be desired with the food.   The larb came to the table warm and had mint leaves that was already turning black. Either the larb was old or the mint leaves used were not fresh. I've made and eaten enough larb to know that mint leaves don't turn black until at least the next day.   There was nothing overly special about the pad thai or yellow curry. Nothing in flavor that screamed \"Wow that was REALLY good.\"   Plus: lunch came with a hot soup and hot crispy spring roll and both were really good!",

Your choice of meat (shrimp and chicken are best) MUST TRY: #29. Panang * (spicy!) Panang curry paste in coconut cream, bell peppers, kaffir lime leaves. It comes spicy-getting any hotter than it comes and you will need some icecream afterwards. Just sayin'! Beautiful restaurant located in the shopping center with Fresh Market.

PERFECT blend of Sweet Heat, fish sauce, spices and herbs. Very tasty and perfectly cooked noodles made this a delectable dish!  Also got their Beef Basil Stir Fry which was outstanding, and a Thai Omelet with a red tomato based sauce with chicken and veggies.  The little Thai waitress was adorable, friendly and attentive. I actually had my FIRST Thai red wine...and it was pretty good! Had NO idea what I was drinking but it sure was tasty!  This is a small restaurant but I came early before it got crowded. This place has been in business for at least 15 years and apparently it has survived in the very competitive food scene for a reason: Their food is EXCELLENT! And not too hard on the wallet either.

The restaurant is in the Strawberry Square shopping center and sits behind Red Rocks.  The restaurant is small and decor is simple.    We arrived and it was dead with only one other table occupied but it quickly filled up.  After looking at the menu, I decided on vegetarian Pad Bai-Krapraw which is similar to Thai dishes I order elsewhere and of course I went with Thai spicy.    My date went with a dinner special, Pra Ram Loungsoung which was your choice of meat in a peanut and chili sauce on a bed of spinach.  My order was perfect with a good mix of veggies, tofu, basil and spice!  The spice level was spot an and cleared out my sinuses..just the way I like it!  The flavor was great as well.  My date's dinner came out wrong but was quickly corrected and after trying it, it was quiet delicious also.    Service was good and they were nice enough to take my date's item off of the bill since it came out late.    I definitely think the place is worth returning to.",

    "text": "Tried this place with my family last week.  When we walked in around 6:30 p.m. there was only one other table seated and our party of 5 walked right and in and was seated. Everything began just fine. We ordered our drinks (they were out of the wine we wanted) and we ordered our appetizers. In relatively short order our appetizers arrived and we waited and waited and waited for our server to take our order. Five other tables were seated in this time and three of them had their orders taken before ours. At first, we did not think anything of it, but later, we found out what a huge pain in the you know what this would be.  When the meals started to arrive, the real ordeal began. First, the meals arrived one at a time with unacceptable intervals between. The first of us got our meal and, when it became apparent the other meals were lagging, he started eating. Then the second meal arrived and again there was a delay, so she started eating. The situation grew uncomfortable because in my family everyone eats TOGETHER. The third meal finally arrived, but what that? Two other people remained. Well, 20 minutes!!!! later the other two had not received their meals. At NO time did anyone come over and check on the table and getting the wait staff's attention proved impossible. Finally 20 minutes after everyone else had received their meals and pretty much finished them, the last two in the party received their meals. When they arrived, they were not the meals we ordered because we had asked for the spice to be mild which they assured us they could do. Well in the \"rush\" to get our final two meals to us, they simply forgot our order.   The manager/owner of the business finally (late in the game) stepped over to the table and said \"I will make this right.\" Now, we never once complained and we never asked him to comp our meals, but we took \"I will make this right\" to mean that he would do SOMETHING.   Well the bill finally arrived and guess what? It was the FULL bill! The owner did not make ANYTHING right!   What a shock from such horrible service.  As for the food, it was just all right. Nothing special from a Thai restaurant. Not bad, but not stellar.  I would avoid this place simply for the horrible service and because the manager/owner is clearly more interested in his bottom line than improving his service or encouraging people to return to this place.",

    "text": "We used to live in Strawberry Hill when we first moved to Charlotte, and haven't been back to Thai Orchid since then (don't know why?). Checked it out again & I'm glad we did.  We started with the fresh rolls - they were really good, especially with the dipping sauce. It had a nice kick!   I had the chicken and shrimp Pad Thai and my husband ventured into something new - the Gai Nei Lung. It looked like a stir fried chicken, vegetable, cashew combo that's served in a really cool fried egg noodle basket. Great presentation! We both thought it was a little bland, but next time we'll ask for it spicier.   They seem to do a lot of takeout orders and I noticed they are part of the Foodie Call service (I've never used it, need to check it out). If you're looking for a new Thai spot, check it out!  P.S. here is the link to their menu: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thaiorchidrestaurantcharlotte.com%2Fexotic-cuisine-services&s=39a86149a55680e5a57ad4f91f3851fe9436c3851331994edfa9c1234fdb3ee3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thaiorchidrestaurantchar...</a>",

It's hard to find it but once you find it, it's like finding a pot of gold. We had the traditional pad Thai, which was delicious and flavorful.  The tom yum soup is probably my favorite.  It's full of flavor and spices.  Their currys are very good also.  The staff was very friendly.  We felt like we were in Thailand without the beaches.  Definitely my favorite place for Thai food.",

Tonight I called my order in and the man on the phone literally told me I couldn't have it the way I wanted. Really? I asked why a month ago they made it for me but wouldn't tonight..he asked if I was sure I had been there before and if I knew where they were located. Yes, thanks. I'm tired of places like this acting so crazy and shocked at something. a little bit different. I eat Thai at least TWICE per week...I order the same thing EVERY SINGLE TIME. I know how and what I like.  Thanks Thai Orchid. I will give my business to someone else, who wants my money & respects me as a customer, no matter the way I want my order.

The Thom Yum was bland and barely sour-- did they even put lemongrass in it? The Pad Thai's flavor can best be described as greasy. It was in a thick reddish sauce which settled mostly at the bottom of the container. They didn't even bother to garnish it with chopped peanuts. If you are dying for Thai food and have no other options, this place is O.K., but I would never recommend it.",

The online menu didn't seem to list the price of the sticky rice ($6.95).  I made sure on my order by phone that it was available/in season.  The guys said yes but the mango was so bitter.  Pretty much a rip off because it's not meant to taste tart.  The green curry was good and they gave a hearty amount but would have been even better if they filled the tall cup toward the rim for the value.  The fresh spring rolls was about a normal price and was excited to see peanut sauce n' vinegary spice sauce inside.  My review years ago was about pad Thai which was a popular foodie item back then. So I'm more familiar with that dish now.",

Larb chicken is made just like how my mom would've made it with exception of her adding more lime and chopping the chicken up.   We also ordered fried chicken for the girls and satay which are both good. For myself, a yellow curry with chicken. Delicious and simple.   For dessert, mango with sticky rice. Sadly they won't do sticky rice by itself but it's okay.   Overall I enjoyed their little romantic restaurant.
