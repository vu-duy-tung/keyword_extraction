All of these were great; however the Spicy Miso is my favorite. I try and stop in once a week. I am so glad Charlotte finally has a good ramen spot.

I ordered the Shoyu Ramen because that what you order when going to a ramen shop that you've never been before to judge the quality and skill of the chef/owner.   Although it wasn't bad. It wasn't worth $13. I would only charge $10 at the most for the flavors they was producing.   They even use the wrong bowls to serve ramen. The bowls they use was meant for soba noodles. That goes to tell you that the owner has no clue of what is ramen.   Going back to the shoyu ramen. It lacked flavor. More so the base broth lacked any real flavor and they counted on the shoyu base to flavor everything. The combination of the shoyu tare & the broth make a good soup. If one is not right, then you're better off eating instant ramen for cheaper price.",

The curry was delicious. The chili paste option is a worthwhile upgrade since it really changes the flavor of the soups it is added to.  Get it on the side if you are wary of spicy things.",

    "text": "Loved it!!!  Beautiful restaurant with lovely, clean ambiance.   I had arguably the best ramen in Charlotte here. It's arguable. I'm not fully convinced but it's a contender for sure! I ordered the Tonkatsu and it was SO FLAVORFUL. I didn't want to stop eating!!!  I want to come back and try everything on the menu! This place is going to be very popular and probably very busy very soon. It's absolutely delicious.  This is my alternative to futobuta, which is also excellent but very crowded and small.  I can't wait to come back and try the takoyaki or the pork buns. Someone told me the pork buns are fantastic!   There aren't a ton of vegetarian options here but there are some... there's a vegetarian friendly broth and they have tofu yakisoba.  They also have delicious green tea mochi for dessert! So refreshing!  As for pricing, it's about the same cost-wise as other ramen places. ramen is around 12-14 dollars.  You can get out of here under 10 dollars if you're penny pinching but I think the next time I visit I'm going to have to do appetizer, entree and dessert, so that would be about 30-40 bucks here. I think it's worth it!  I can't think of anything else to put! Thanks for reading this far, go forth and eat ramen!",

Sheng just fixed all that.  The Tonkotsu came out in about 6 minutes flat.  Perfect temperature to enjoy immediately. I also appreciate the care they took to prep the eggs separately and place them in last for the perfect, ramen egg consistency.  Broth was rich and I made it out under 15$ not counting tip.  On that note, the service was what service should be.  Not any wine and dine just prompt polite service.  Plenty of refills and though I did not imbibe they NOW HAVE ALCOHOL!  Excited to come back and try the rest!  Sincerely,  -Susan...I mean Dan.",

Highlight of the tonkotsu ramen for me was the broth (great mouth feel) and the pork belly, which was amazing. Tender and delicate and extremely tasty, not too fatty at all, def memorable.   We've been desperately missing pre-sell-out Yume. Does Sheng live up as a replacement?  The broth is definitely on point, so are the toppings for sure. I think this place serves up more variety. I like that the different ramen bowls have different toppings. My only disappointment was, I didn't think the noodles were anything special.. They were just fine, but I miss home made noodles. But I don't want to over critique - everything else was great. Worth repeat visits and will def recommend.  Ps Be warned if you get tonkatsu ramen with the spicy chili sauce (which I loved)... It's a lot of chili! They put a pile on top for you to mix in, so a smarter person than I would have scooped a little out. But I have pretty high spice tolerance so I was like NAH I'LL USE IT ALL AS CHEF INTENDED. It was very spicy :)",

I believe we got to the restaurant s little bit before 6pm, there were a few tables but they were not crazy busy yet. Their menu is pretty decent and everything looks to be good but we both decided to go with the same thing, first option of Ramen on their menu. (Sorry, forgot the name) my husband order a Japanese soda that was very sweet but at the same time good, tasted just like childhood. Our food came fast and it was sooooooo good. It was way better than I expected. The restaurant was well decorated and clean, our waitress was very friendly and attentive and as I said the food just delicious! Not long after we arrived a lot of people came in so if you want to beat the Saturday night dinner rush you might want to consider going a little bit before 6pm. My husband and I will definitely be back and this time we will try the hot pot!",

The exterior looked complete with their sign hanging up and the hours posted on the door, but the interior was not fully constructed. When I finally heard that this place was open, I was ecstatic to have a nearby ramen place. The place is new, so of course it was clean. The ramen is pricey at $13 per bowl, but slightly cheaper than uptown ramen prices. I was not a fan of the noodles themselves because I prefer more texture/waviness. These were fairly straight and resembled spaghetti noodles. I had their Tonkotsu Ramen (braised pork belly, egg, cabbage, bean sprouts, onion, fish cake, pickled ginger, sesame seed, scallion, and garlic oil in pork broth). It's not too often that I see cabbage and bean sprouts with ramen, but they added a nice little crunch. The broth was a little disappointing and not as rich as I would have liked. It's usually the star of ramen dishes, but sadly, it was not. Portion size is good. Staff is attentive and friendly. Perhaps my expectations were simply too high since I was awaiting their opening for so long.",

We had Two different kinds of Ramen. We had the Spicy Tonkotsu and the Spicy Miso Ramen. We started with Gyoza for the kids and they were delicious. Then came our Ramen in beautiful big bowls. Graced with eggs and fresh ginger, the Tonkotsu had Pork Belly in it and the Miso Ramen had ground chicken. I feel like the seasoning could have been a little more flavorful, and maybe for 14.00 and 13,00 a little more meat. The Chili Paste they give you on the side is great and very spicy. We also ordered The Yakitori to go and the Curry Ramen which has Chicken Katsu in it.  All in all It is a welcome addition to the South Side. I wish they had Homemade Noodles but I will take these. They do need to add some vegetarian dishes to the menu. For the Veg Heads!",

The wait was a bit long when we came in, even though the host told us it would only be 10 minutes. It also took a while to get our food and we ordered as soon as we sat down. Otherwise, great ambiance, friendly service, affordable delicious ramen.",

I loved the flavor of the broth and the chicken inside of it was on point. A well decorated place, that was extremely clean! They have other options as well if you don't love Ramen. The one thing that was disappointing was they charge you by the can for sodas. I wanted a refill but didn't want to pay another $2.25. :( a small complaint, so if that concerns you I would just get water! Service was wonderful as well. When I'm back in town I would love to come again!",

    "text": "I have always been a ramen fan, ever since I was a kid my mother would make ramen on cold days so that the broth would warm me up.  It did not matter if it was the packaged deep fried ramen or the Kimchi Jjigae that used the Nong Shim Shin Ramyun noodle, ramen was always something that was quick and tasty in my parent's house.  That is why, whenever I hear there is a Ramen shop that is close by where I am, I have to go and try out their ramen, and Sheng Ramen does not disappoint.  I was seated immediately and was promptly asked by the waitress about my drink order, which is a plus for me.  The waitress was patient and would answer any questions I had about the menu in general.  Her attention was very good and after I had finished ordering, she would repeat it to verify that my order was correct, another plus.  Finally when my meal was done, she was very prompt in getting the dishes off my table and providing my check to me.  Now about my meal, I started by ordering two of my favorite:  The pork belly bao and takoyaki.  They both came out at the same time and were piping hot.    The bao were soft, the pork belly was tender, but the addition of lettuce and cucumber was surprising. As soon as you bite into the bao, the pork belly was very tasty and only required the slightest of chew, which the lettuce and cucumber provided.  The cucumber added a cooling, refreshing addition to the bao.  And the sauce was on point, completing the bao and bringing the different components together.  The takoyaki came with the bonito shavings and the mayonnaise and Japanese 'Worchester' sauce, and sitting on a bed of thinly sliced cabbage. It looked very appetizing, as the bonito shavings moved from the heat the takoyaki produced.  The takoyaki was extremely hot and I had to employ the Japanese 'ho ho ho' to puff out the heat and make the takoyaki easier to eat. That is one of the thing I enjoy about takoyaki.  The octopus was cooked thoroughly and provided the slight chew.  The batter was extremely tasty with the outer coating slightly charred but the inside still soft and gooey. Overall a standard takoyaki, but still a very good choice for those that like takoyaki.  Finally my main order arrived, curry ramen...  Something that at the time was new to me as I always order the Tonkotsu ramen, but I do love a good curry and this did not disappoint.  The curry was a yellow curry watered down to a soup base, but still retaining the standard curry taste.  The ramen contained a chicken Katsu cutlet two medium boiled eggs, corn, cabbage, bean sprouts, onion, and scallions.  The chicken Katsu was crunchy and light.  The ramen noodles were chewy and was able to hold on to the curry broth.  The corn added sweetness and a soft crunch.  The egg was a medium boiled egg that you see in all ramen shops in Japan. The cabbage and bean sprouts added crunch even after been in the curry broth for a while. The scallion and onion provided an added texture to the ramen.  Overall the ramen was extremely flavorful, and one that I will definitely come back for again and again.",

This time, the food was good and service was a lot better. Charlotte has a lot of Ramen Place now, I will consider this as ok, it is in the Ballantyne area, since there two other restaurant in the area serves Ramen. The soup base taste good in my opinion needs to be more rich in favor.  Taste: 3.5 out of 5 Good taste, it has room for improvement   Environment: 4 out of 5 Clean and comfortable   Service: 4 out of 5 Friendly and food came fast  Value: 2.5 out of 5 $13 to $14 for bowl of Ramen, it is expensive with tips and tax, you will spending close to $20 for lunch.",

When we asked about the hotpot, the waitress did not have any knowledge of the type of broth. I would recommend the owner to educate all waiters about the dishes that they serve.   We order the tonkatsu ramen, beef hotpot and chicken katsu. The broth of the ramen was tasty. The texture of the ramen is too soft and more similar to Chinese noodle. I heard from my Japanese friend that you can ask for the chewy one. The hot pot was nothing special and the beef was tough. The portion of the katsu was large, however it was oily and it seemed that they have not replaced the oils from a long time.  I will give it another try in the future.",

Just ask my wife, she'll tell you! The noodles, the broth, the fish cake, all of it. I want it to be apart of my weekly meal plan.

These steak kabobs are an abundance of flavor and tenderness on a stick. These are literally the most perfect bite one could ever ask for. These are a must for every visit.   The Pork Belly Buns on our first visit were amazing. The second visit, the recipe had slightly changed and we didn't love them as much. They were still good but they had way too much sauce on them this time and the balance of flavors were not there like previously.   The veggie eggrolls are good, flavored with a hint of curry and always served piping hot.   The dumplings are good, crispy on the bottom and juicy and delicious on the inside. However, they were not anything to go crazy about. I wouldn't come here just for those.   The soups on our first visit were amazing delicious and so very tasty. The second visit, the broth just seemed a bit different and not as wonderful.   The service here is great, the waitresses do a great job of making sure everything is good and ensuring you have what you need.   They do have bento boxes and hot pots too, if ramen is not your thing. We also tried the chicken yakisoba which was okay. The noodles are the same as what you would find in the ramen but the chicken was a bit on the bland side.   Overall, this is a good ramen house. You can satiate the craving for ramen if you've got a hankering.",

I ate them joints like I was Naruto returning to the Hidden Leaf Village after completing an A Rank mission.   The seating is cool because in addition to the tables they have a counter with some seats where you can see the food being prepared or around the corner for the True introverts like myself. The place is clean and new with some nice decor.   We had appetizers in addition to our ramen bowls and I'm happy to report they were all amazing.The Yakitori stole the show especially the steak Yakitori. You should get that if you get a chance. I'd recommend it over all the other apps even though all the apps are great. The gyoza, spring rolls and takoyaki blew my socks off as well.   I like this place so much that we went to a restaurant in walking distance. And as we were looking at the menus deciding what to get my heat wouldn't stop longing for Sheng Ramen. I stood up like a man in a Rom Com who just realized that the once in a lifetime love of his life is about to board a plane back to her hometown. I jumped up and ran out of the door to my True love... Sheng Ramen.   My wife got up to make apologies to the other restaurant but love doesn't care about second place. I said \"Do whatever you need to do Karen. I'll be at Sheng Ramen!\"   I ran jumped over a few cars and dogged some luggage racks to make it over to Sheng's where I immediately got down on one knee, pulled out and engagement ring and ordered a Tunkotsu Ramen bowl. It's that serious guys.",

    "text": "Wow! I am a HUGE ramen fan and Sheng Ramen did not disappoint at all. I honestly haven't had this good of ramen since I've been in NYC.   My family and I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, Shoyu Ramen, and Curry Ramen. I got to taste all three and all three were delicious. The pork belly in the Tonkotsu and Shoyu were grilled and cooked to absolute perfection and the flavor was amazing. I also wanted to point out how delicious and beautifully cooked the eggs were. My sister is a vegetarian and substituted the chicken in the curry ramen for the tofu and that was also very yummy. All of the dishes we ordered had lots of vegetables and plenty of noodles all cooked and seasoned very well.   The broth/soup for the Tonkotsu was very fresh and the flavors were impressive because they tasted like a real ramen broth. The soup in the Shoyu was also delicious but has a hint of chicken stock which I was 100% fine with.   I would recommend the Tonkotsu over the Shoyu if you want a stronger flavor but I absolutely loved both!  Lastly, the presentation was very nice and the design of the restaurant was very pretty with a painted mural. I also appreciated that they used actual wooden chopsticks and wooden soup spoons instead of take out ones like most ramen places give you. I will definitely come back soon!",

And Shoyu Ramen. And Tonkatsu Ramen.   Maybe I feel like crying because this pork flavored broth feels so good in my gullet on this rainy spring day. Maybe it's because it's like a nice soft towel straight from the dryer, after spending all day at Carowinds...on a Saturday...during Spring Break.   Whatever. It's good. GOOD. Like the Savior's love good.   Happy Easter.",

Once sitting down we asked the waitress for suggestions and any questions we had about each entree. I finally decided on the pork belly ramen which was AMAZING! We also ordered the gyoza which weren't bad, however the sauce for it was yummy. Can't wait to go back and try more RAMEN.... super happy they chose to come to the Ballantyne area we need a Ramen place in the area because OMG is it yummy !",

Today, my husband and I decided to give it a shot and boy, was that a good decision. This is unbelievably good. I had the curry one and it was a party of flavors going on in my mouth. Not too spicy but spicy enough, the noodles were cooked perfectly and the service was incredible. I had a server who was the sweetest. Her name was Callie. Also, it was so much Food that I wasn't able to finish it and that is something that does not happen a lot because I CAN EAT. I'll be back soon!!",

    "text": "My NC Ramen prayers have finally answered *sheds tear*. JUST discovered Sheng last week and after \"much needed\" convincing from all the friends who could not stop raving about this place, I had to go immediately! Twist my arm, I know.   We started the meal off with taboyaki, the classic octopus balls. Perfect balance of flavors and a great octopus to dough ratio. First sign of a good ramen spot? They give you a ladle for your ramen. We went with the traditional Tonkatsu Ramen and another Tonkatsu Ramen with a spicy bomb added as our entrees. Usually I'm hesitant to add the spicy bombs to any ramen as it alters the flavors.. but it was just calling my name! I loveeee spicy foods! I'm glad I went with the spicy addition because it was the perfect balance and did not disrupt the Tonkatsu equilibrium (it exists). It also had a nice garlic flavor to it. I wouldn't say this is my favorite Ramen spot ever as it doesn't compare to the ones I've had in DC and NY, but dare I say best in Charlotte? Bold statement, I know. Can't wait to go back and try the other ramen dishes, bento box, hot pot and yakitori! Good/bad thing this place is less than 5 minutes from work!",
