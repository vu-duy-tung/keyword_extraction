    "text": "When I first saw that this place opened I thought LAWL not another BBQ place in Charlotte!  But I was in the area at lunchtime and decided to try it. I got in line about 11:45 and when I left at 12:30 it was packed.  I had the light lunch brisket, with bark and marbling.  It was thinly sliced and tender, really did not even need sauce! Sides are the most difficult decision ever to make in life.  I had the vinegar slaw, chunky and so tart and fresh, a flavor explosion that tempered the BBQ perfectly. Hush puppies were large and nicely crafted in shape, not sweet and not oniony, just a heaping portion to tone down any heat.  Next time I will try the collards and potato salad.  Outdoor seating looked cool too! Will definitely be back!",

When you order a whole rack, they (usually) give you an entire rack; hence the sleeve. These were dry and not as good as usual; probably some leftovers. It's a shame because, since BBQ isn't cheap, you shouldn't be getting dry leftovers.",

I love that this place has lunch specials, its a much better deal then doing drive thru salad at Zaxbys. About the same price, but you are getting so much more food. I went with the pulled pork and potato salad and green beans. The pulled pork was great and the swine wine was to die for! I love spicy, vinegary BBQ sauce. The potato salad was good. I love a more mashed version of it. I didn't like the green beans. They were too mushy. I thought the service was great and appreciated the guy in the dining room coming over to pick up my dishes. I will most definitely be back.",

I ordered mine with cole slaw on top.  Sides are separate, and they had a seasonal item of sweet potato casserole, which was probably the best I've ever had.  Hushpuppies, baked beans with brisket, and mac & cheese rounded out the side selections.  The cashier offered to let us sample any of the menu items in making our selections which was very nice and helpful.  Later during the meal, they came around and offered samples of their banana pudding, which was incredible.  If we had saved any room for dessert, we would have ordered following the sample.  The manager also gave us a piece of their chocolate cake since we were gathered to celebrate my wife's birthday, and it was outstanding the next day.   The sweet tea and lemonade are excellent; no Coca-Cola products unfortunately.   They have more sauce choices than any BBQ restaurant I have ever been to.  I preferred the original over the Bourbon and Spicy versions I tried.  Definitely appeared to have something for everyone's taste. Two sandwiches, four sides, and two drinks came out to $26.   We will definitely be back soon!",

They have a lunch special during the week - I didn't see this available at the Matthews location but maybe it wasn't posted as I went on the weekend.  I've tried the pulled rib meat, pulled pork, and pulled chicken.  I don't care for the pulled chicken as it doesn't have a lot of flavor.  Pulled pork is good.  I really like the pulled rib meat ( again available at Ballantyne for lunch special but I did not see this on the menu at this location).  The mac & cheese is okay.  If you're only going to get one side then get the corn pudding - it's awesome and everyone I have been with agrees.  The fries are hand cut and really great as well.  I've only had the banana pudding for dessert and it's worth a try.  I think I will try the peach cobbler next time.  Great addition to the Matthews area!",

Hubby amd I shared and there was still left overs. We got the pulled Chipotle rib meat and a very tender full flavor cut of brisket. Yum yum. I am not big on barbecue but this is my favorite place for it so far in Charlotte. The price is great and the food delish. Plus the service is superb. We were checked on a few times and even offered dessert. It was my birthday dinner and I did get the chocolate cake. Must say its very close to my own recipe. I don't know that I could tell them apart if side by side. 10 stars for service and 8 for food(hubby wanted wings). Keep up the friendly service and laid back atmosphere.",

You can choose booths or tables indoors or sit outside at umbrella-topped tables. There are tv's located throughout tuned to sports venues. We dined late afternoon and there were few other diners at the time. The music over the stereo system was very loud and made conversation difficult. The servings of meat and sides were generous and we took home enough for another meal in the takeout containers provided at the self-serve stations where we got beverages and sauces. I'm definitely coming back for a taste of some of their other specials.",

I purchased the half chicken since I couldn't decide what I wanted. Chicken had pretty good flavoring for $9.99. The Mac n cheese was amazing! I also got fried pickles, which were nice and thick, and the sauce was good.  My daughter got the kids Mac n cheese, cornbread and ate part of my chicken :-)  My husband got brisket (he said it was a bit fatty, but generally good). He also got baked beans, Mac n cheese, and potato salad. Love the potato salad!!  My brother-in-law got the turkey on the bun. He said the turkey was super tender and delicious. He also got green beans, and Mac n cheese. Said both were good!  My daughter and I got lemonade to drink, it was very good! My husband and brother-in-law both got beer, and said that they liked the choices available.  The only thing we didn't like was the sauce caddy. Although they are esthetically pleasing-- it seems like you can't disinfect them. Though, I could just be a weird person and maybe they throw them away and change them regularly   Other than that-- I will say, we will likely be back as the food was good for the price and the staff was incredibly friendly :-)",

So a little on the pricey side, but will be back due to the taste and atmosphere!  One tip for this restaurant- PLEASE ADD A CUT THROUGH ON THE STREET TO PULL IN. The road you basically have to make a u-turn if your passing oreily auto and coming in the side of the restaurant.",

At the self-service counter where you get your sodas and beverages there also homemade pickles which are made fresh every day by one of the cooks. There's a plethora of barbecue sauces ranging from hot spicy tangy and sweet. The staff are extremely happy helpful and they seem to love their jobs which makes the experience of coming here pleasant. It is one of The few places in Charlotte I have frequented more than five times.",

Only issue is that it is a little more expensive than the other BBQs since a side order is not included but we will return soon anyway.",

    "text": "I absolutely love BBQ and would consider myself somewhat of a BBQ snob. While Charlotte certainly has plenty of BBQ restaurants, most are not memorable, objectively bad, and just not worth visiting. So, when friends and family started telling me about City BBQ, a chain nonetheless, I really was not expecting much. I was more than pleasantly surprised, though.  SERVICE Like a fast food joint, you order your food at the counter and then pick it up once it's ready. Unlike a fast food join, the employees here are actually friendly and (at least seem to) enjoy their jobs.  FOOD I'll start with where City BBQ shines: the meat. After sampling some of the bland BBQ that Charlotte has to offer, you might come into City BBQ and ask yourself what this strange flavor is. It's wood smoke. And City BBQ uses different types of wood for each meat, the way it's supposed to be done. In addition to pulled pork, City also serves brisket (not real BBQ), chicken (also not real BBQ), and ribs. All four meats taste great and are served with plenty of bark (unless you get chicken, which is not real BBQ). I believe they also serve sausage, but I have not tried it.  The side items are also worth noting. City has the typical BBQ restaurant sides like fries and slaw, but they also have a few others such as fried okra and corn pudding. They all taste great and come in fairly generous portions.  Each table comes with a few bottles of City's own BBQ sauce, and there is even a condiment bar with more. City also has thickly-sliced pickles, jalepenos, and red onions. Oh, and they have plenty of wet wipes in case eating your ribs get a bit messy (or if you're eating chicken, which isn't real BBQ).  PRICES City's prices are in line with other BBQ places, which tend to be around $15 per meal. I would consider that pretty fair.  Overall, I really enjoyed City and have been back. My only real complaint is their menu layout. Every time I go, there is always someone in line who does not understand that everything is ordered separately. City, throw a combo with a meat and a side up there to move things along and to avoid the \"what do you mean my meat doesn't come with a side\" talk.  PRO TIP: before you go, download the app and sign up for an account. You get a free drink on your first visit and then $5 off your next meal for every $100 you spend. If you have a family, this is essentially $5 off every other visit.",

    "text": "Having lived in the Carolinas all my life and going to college in Alabama as well as working in barbecue restaurants, I consider myself a barbecue snob. I was skeptical about barbecue from Ohio since I've been spoiled when it comes to smoked swine. My husband and I ordered the judge's sampler which is enough to feed two people. There was plenty of meat, but two  5oz sides is definitely a sample and not a side at all when sharing. My husband ate the brisket since I'm not a fan of it and he said that it was just okay- a bit dry and bland, and he ordered the fatty brisket. The ribs were good and came clean off of the bone. I loved their smoked chicken as it had a rich smoky flavor and was mopped in sauce. Then there's the pork. Well, the pork isn't exciting at all to our dismay. It had no flavor and was dry. Disappointing. The corn souffle was good as were the baked beans, but they were really too sweet.  So, we tried, we ate, and it was lackluster. I don't see any visits back in our future.",

We have a lot of quality BBQ in CLT, so I'm not easily impressed.  I have to say, i was very pleased with all the items we tried.    You can tell the employees here know the in's and outs of BBQ prep and it tells in the flavors of the meats!  Don't get me wrong, i love sauces, and they have some really tasty ones (the Piedmont has some kick!) but all the proteins can stand alone! The Brisket was my favorite, hands down, great smoky flavor.   I'm not a huge sausage fan, but i really enjoyed theirs.  I can't wait to try a pulled pork sandwich, because i only tried the pork with their vinegar slaw snd it was really solid! Ribs were good and their smoked Turkey should make a great sandwich!   Speaking of sandwiches, i can't wait to try their More Cowbell: Beef Brisket, topped with peppers, smoked provolone, onions and creamy horseradish sauce piled high on Texas toast!  On to the sides!  For starters, i take pride in always ordering potato salad at BBQ joints.  I've had  some bad ones and some good one's.....their 100 year old recipe is one of the best i've ever had! The greens were really good, Baked Beans solid.  I can't wait to try this corn pudding they serve.    For dessert, they gave us their Banana Pudding.  It was delicious!  They put a little caramel drizzle on it, which mixes really well!    Friendly staff!  The manager has been in the restaurant business for 30 years.  I think this is a perfect location for the Matthews neighborhood!",

    "text": "I really love barbecue. Nothing puts a smile on my face like a juicy, tender, smoked piece of pulled pork with some classic Carolina sauce. So when I heard that a new barbecue joint had opened up, naturally, I was excited and ready to give it a try. A week after this place opened, I entered with an empty stomach and a craving for some good ole southern BBQ.   Upon entering the restaurant, I was thoroughly impressed with the setup. It had a modern vibe, but also an appeal to a classic steakhouse/bbq restaurant with all sorts of western and southern memorabilia on the walls.   The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is very much welcoming. The lines can get long, but for me, that usually is a good indicator of the quality and popularity of the food.  Once I got to the register, I decided I wanted to try a little bit of everything, so I ordered the sampler. This came with sausage, pulled pork, smoked chicken, and garlic bread.  After not that long of a wait, fortunately, I received the food and also went to get some barbecue dipping sauces. I was genuinely impressed with the sauce bar, which had all sorts of local sauces to try. I took a small cup of the original and sat to eat.  After finishing my meal, I was absolutely and massively... unmoved. To City's credit, the chicken was smoked well but that's about it. The pulled pork, sausage, and garlic bread were all unimpressive. I felt the pulled pork could've been smoked a little longer and the garlic bread just missed the mark. The sausage was ok at best.  For all the hype this restaurant received, I was expecting something at least exceptional, and I cannot say that expectation was met.  I give City Barbecue a 3 out of 5 to match its mediocrity in quality of food.",

The food is consistent and good bbq but the service has made us reluctant to return.  The last few times I've ordered pickup there has been something missing from my order and I've had to wait around longer than usual.  The last time we visited was a Friday around 7 and we had placed a takeout order.  When my husband arrived to pick up he said the employees were fighting and yelling at each other in front of everyone and they were basically out of meat.  We already paid on the app so he said for them to refund the order since we obviously weren't getting any food.  My husbands fault for not waiting but they basically did not process the refund and we had to call back and talk to another manager to get it refunded.  We are very understanding people and know that sometimes in service things will happen like running out of meat, but how you handle the situation is important and it was handled poorly.  Customers are not interested in hearing a bunch of excuses, just be professional and apologetic and handle the situation appropriately and quickly.",

We can vouch for the motherload's capability of feeding six people, and for the deliciousness of the food. The only improvement possible here would be that the side dishes could be larger. For example, if all six of you want Mac and cheese, you'll need to order three Mac and cheese sides.   Our order was ready within 25 minutes of us ordering it on a Saturday night, so the timelines of the food wasn't an issue at all. I definitely recommend this restaurant, and the spicy BBQ sauce.",

The customer service was horrible, I have worked in food before and I know it can be stressful so you try to make it a fun environment with co-workers, but they were slow and the cashier lady was rude... She kept talking to her friend, kept telling her friend to \"smell her shirt because it smelled so good\" while I was trying to order, I had to repeat my order 3 times because she was busy talking to her friend. The cashier didn't even say hello or thank you. She also had talked about how she was sick, which I understand, we are all human and get sick, but please don't tell me you are sick and then you touch the tray of food I am about to eat...

    "text": "We wanted to try one of the feasts, but were told by the cashier that they were out of ribs at 6 pm on a Saturday. Later we learned from another patron that they were making more ribs, but it would be a 10 min wait. We would've waited 10 mins for ribs so we could've gotten the meal we actually wanted. Communication seems to be an issue here.   I tried the brisket tacos. The brisket was ok, but chewy. The tacos were also tiny for $9.  They needed a side to be included for that price.   My dining companions were happy with the cornbread and pulled pork. The mac & cheese was ok, but nothing special. It tasted like noodles with cheese sauce poured over it. It didn't taste special or made-from-scratch.   We'll probably give this place another chance as overall the food was decent and the atmosphere was fun.",

It's really different although I'm not happy about the price increase on some of the barbecue... everything is always great here and the staff is more than helpful. Absolutely love this location As they go the extra mile and it's always super clean and well-maintained! Kudos City!",

    "text": "I would like to disclose that I ordered food through Grubhub on a Tuesday night.  I did not actually go to the restaurant since I had a long day of travel.  I was given a time frame of 50-60 minutes at a round 7:00 pm.  I ordered a sweet tea, more cowbell sandwich with mac and cheese and a side salad with chipolte ranch dressing.   I was sent a text/email indicating that my food would be there at 8:05 pm.  Sweet.  At 8:15 pm, I contacted Grubhub, and they said the driver was delay.  I was promised that my food would be there in 15 minutes (at 8:45 pm).  At 8:55 pm, I contacted Grubhub again, and they said the restaurant still did not have my order ready (per driver), and it would be another 10-15 minutes.  At 9:15 pm, my food finally got there.  The food was luke warm.  No silverware or napkins (kinda odd for a salad, bbq place, mac and cheese).  The receipt said \"promise time 7:40 pm.\"  They broke the promise.  The host did not put the order in until 8:30 pm, over 1 1/2 hours after the order.  I guess it would have been within the 50-60 minute time frame if the restaurant actually put my order in at 7:00 pm when I ordered my food.  I doubt the restaurant was so busy on a Tuesday night to delay an order by 1 1/2 hours.  I doubt the restaurant would have even processed the order if I did not waste 20+ minutes navigating the Grubhub customer service (twice).  Maybe this restaurant and Grubhub aren't pals and should break up.    Onto the food.  For the south, I expected good, tender, well-seasoned brisket.  That was not the case.  It was dry.  Barely warmer than room temperature.  It was small for an $11+ dollar sandwich.  I was still hungry after eating the sandwich, mac and cheese, and salad.  I had to scavenge for silverware.  I did not even need napkins because the sandwich was dry.  I was hoping the restaurant felt bad for the 2.5 hour processing time and would throw in dessert/another side.  I read affectionate reviews indicating the services was top notch.  But this place does not care.  I was let down with service and quality of food.",

Its my favorite kinda place because you dont have to deal with servers or closing out tickets at the end of the meal.  You just claim your table...eat...and go.....  BBq was some of the best Ive had in Charlotte.  I likenit because it is pulled and not chopped.   The BBq is not fatty at all....and there are no \"questionable\" pieces on the plate.  Sometimes...when you eat BBq ...you might get that one sketchy piece that turns you off.    I had Baked Beans, Corn Pudding, and Creamy slaw.  All in all they were pretty dang good....I felt like all 3 could have used a little more salt.     If you are looking or a scrumptuos place to eat with no pain in the ass service....this is it.   I really really like it.  Prices are a bit high....but not over the top",

The corn pudding while tasty was only lukewarm. The green beans also tasted like they were from a can rather than fresh. I've had really good barbecue in Charlotte. This was just not one of them. This is the place I won't be going back to which is a shame because it's very close. I also thought they were extremely overpriced for the food that I received.",

While the brisket was The Bomb, the potato salad was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT as it was WAY TOO SALTY!  Green beans and pulled pork were as expected - great!  Went out of my way to talk to mgmt as we left commending them on the brisket and suggesting that the potato salad had issues.  Manager tasted a sample and after making a face in response, agreed that it was not good.  Sadly not only did the salt burn the end of our tongue and all the taste buds but it ruined their FAMOUS Banana Pudding dessert which sadly seemed to be less than fresh, likely from last night???  With such a lack luster response from mgmt (sad because I usually report both the good and the bad???), it may be a while before we visit them again . . .",

My go to choices are the beef brisket with collard greens and the smokehouse turkey salad. The banana pudding is so delicious and I usually get that as my second side. They also have fries that you can add bacon & cheese too, it could have been a meal itself but they were good.  I've only had a few issues but each one was handle great. They have an app that is easy to use and allows you to earn rewards, Ive earned quite a few myself.

The mobile app was easy to maneuver ended up indulging on 2 combo meals with one side each and one pulled pork sandwich with fries .  Arrived at City BBQ Matthews at 8:25 , waited outside at one of the curb side pickup spots until about 8:35 . No one came out , they appeared busy so I called and stated no one has come out to bring us our order yet . The young lady that came out to greet us told us they didn't have receipt of our order . 3-2-1 , 1-2-3 ... this is my on the go method of calming down before I spit out Hangry remarks . I showed the employee our email receipt .  After waiting 10 more minutes she comes back out with a large bag , apologizing and offering a few extra treats for the inconvenience.  (unfortunately I can't comment on them bc I'm not eating yummy chocolate cake or banana pudding right now)   Now, the food ... the reason behind my 3star rating  BRISKET : plenty in our servings but a lil too dry for my liking .  I don't want to have to slather it with bbq sauce  SAUSAGE: it was good , I actually ate this more than the brisket , but nothing I'm salivating to come back for  PULLED CHICKEN : Dry ... that's all  PULLED PORK : Dry... I'm sure paired with the coleslaw it would be a little better but I'm more of a Carolina bbq kinda gal with mayo inspired slaw and a vinegar base bbq pork... sooooo you get my drift .  COLLARDS: The winner of this entire dinner.  Yummy to my southern girl tummy .   Overall, I'm sure City BBQ will continue to receive lots of traffic , the food isn't bad , the service was really nice, but it's just not my cup of tea for bbq.",

Customer Service--the young lady that took my order was really nice and actually cared about helping me figure out what I wanted to order.She even gave her feedback,as well as past guest.There was a guy calling out the orders as they were ready and I just loved his enthusiasm.He spoke as people entered,as they left,and even asked how their meals were when he saw them packing up.He asked me too.I love being in a customer focused environment.Kuddos to the team here!!I will be back!",

    "text": "This place fully delivers on their promise of being devoted to the craft of BBQ. As of right now, this is the closest location to me and is a bit of a hike but worth every mile. Bright side? They are opening a location in the University area in the coming months.  Full disclosure: I got to try out this location a few months ago thanks to a Yelp elite event and was able to try the chicken, sausage, pulled pork, ribs, brisket, and a slew of sides. Not to sound hyperbolic, but everything was truly delicious. However, I found that the brisket was the clear-cut winner.  For this visit, I went with the 'pick-two-meat option': pulled pork and brisket and an order of Lo's pulled pork sandwich. As the side for both, I chose the creamy cole slaw for one and the vinegary cole slaw for the other.  While waiting for my order, I hit up the fixins bar. I scooped up a few of the sauces in to-go containers, as well as some pickles and red onion. I love this feature  I got the two meats for my parents to enjoy and that they did. They are both extremely difficult to please when it comes to BBQ meat but found nothing to criticize with City BBQ. My meal was the pulled pork sandwich and I loved every bite. The cool, crunchy vinegary slaw added delicious texture to the smoky, juicy pork.  If you consider yourself a BBQ connoisseur, I recommend you head over to your nearest City BBQ and load up on #allthemeats.",

Even after I didn't know what i wanted. I kept it simple I ordered a pulled pork, fries, and a drink. The pulled pork was on point. The young lady who took my order suggested the sweet sauce to go with it. Great choice. I have no complaints other than I will have to go back and try another sauce, and maybe another menu item just to see what else City Barbeque has to offer my taste buds.",

My little brisket sandwich was extremely dry (see picture) and not very tasty at all. I had to add sauce to the small sandwich just to get some much needed moisture.   On the plus side, they had a variety of good sauces, but the sauce should not be the star of a BBQ joint!  I have had lots of versions of corn pudding and this was the worst! The texture was more like a mushy corn muffin instead of the creamy corn pudding I am used to having and the taste was not appetizing at all.   I don't mind paying a decent price for good food, but $11.67 was waaaaay too much for what I received.  I almost want to give them a second try (on the beef, definitely not the corn pudding!!!!) based on the reviews, thinking maybe I went on an off day. It was President's Day and they seemed to have pretty steady traffic inside. I really don't understand all the fuss! I was not happy and I am skeptical to give this place another try. I am only considering it because of the reviews. Well, I definitely wont be going back any time soon!",

They should call people that place orders to let them know they cannot fulfill them before they come up there. It's a shame because this place has great barbecue but their customer service is horrible.

I got the pulled chicken and baked beans sandwich special. I was VERY surprised at how moist the chicken is. I'm use to having to add sauce to moisten meat but I didn't need to. I did add the original bbq sauce for another layer of flavor and it didn't disappoint. I will admit it is a bit pricey (I looked on the website) but WELL worth EVERY penny in flavor. My hubby agrees on the price but he says the flavor is worth it to. The collard greens taste ALMOST like mine. Please go and enjoy the food.",

    "text": "Living in Matthews, I had passed by City Barbeque quite a few times on my way in and out of town and kept making a mental note to try it, but never got around to it, until last weekend when I was craving BBQ and decided on City Barbeque to get my fix.  Upon seeing the menu, I was pretty undecided on what I wanted, but eventually settled for my pretty \"safe\" go-to order for a new barbeque place, a pulled pork sandwich, with baked beans, vinegar slaw and a drink.  The person working the register let me know they have a special called \"light lunch\" where the sandwich is only 1/4 pound of meat as opposed to the regular half pound, so I opted for that.  I was surprised to find that for a quarter pound sandwich and two sides was $12!  Definitely on the high end of what I've seen for a BBQ lunch, even from surrounding restaurants.  That being said, the food was good.  The vinegar slaw was very good (I'm  a sucker for it), and the baked beans were definitely interesting.  VERY sweet, thick and syrupy, drowning in the sweet sauce they're cooked in.  The meat is good and the vinegar sauce is pretty standard eastern-carolina vinegar sauce (there are several to choose from, but this is always my go-to).  Overall, a solid lunch spot, but boasts a price I was a little surprised by.  Worth checking out if you're a BBQ lover.",

I got the smokehouse turkey salad and it was huge and delicious.  The turkey was really good.  For the rest of my family we got a large bbq platter with three sides, okra, baked beans, and hush puppies.  We also got a bbq sandwich and fries.    We ordered a cobbler to split for dessert.

My husband got the More Cowbell with collards and potato salad. We enjoyed every single bit of it. Including all of the sauce options",

Great atmosphere.  This was our second visit and since we had a buy-one-get-one-free coupon, my wife and I splurged and both got the double meat combo (which is Fred Flintstone big.) We tried the pulled pork, beef brisket and chicken breast. All were excellent but the star here is the brisket, which had the perfect char and smoke. It'll be my go-to dish going forward here. For our sides, we chose the collards, which were cooked perfectly, a side salad, and mac and cheese.  Serving sizes were huge. Service was tops. Sanitation score was a 98. All signs of a well-managed restaurant and one that I will label a Gotta Try for sure!",

The addition of Provolone, Bell Peppers, & Onions was a nice. Didn't notice any sauce in the mix, but this may have been due to it being Naked, though sauce removal was not mentioned under that option.  Green Beans w/Bacon was spot on and devoured.  Collards w/Pork was as the same as above.  The Sausage was snappy and hearty. Just as it should be. The Slaw, sweet though only Vinegar was mentioned, was fine. Not a sugar fan. It's poison.  LowCo Mustard Sauce was also sweet, though the underlying flavor was perfect.  The Gallon of Tea tasted fresh brewed without a hint of age. Fantastic. Unsweet of course.  All together the meal was delicious. I will definitely order from here again.  PS. You may want to request paper plates & cutlery for none came with order.  On a side note: Ordered all through GrubHub Delivery. Driver was 1:45 late to pick up the food. Was starving by arrival. Had to contact restaurant in order to check status, but their preparation was on time. Just a slow outside source delivery driver. Contacted GH and had tip removed plus $10 towards my next order.",

I know what they say, \"quality over quantity\"  but the quality wasn't anything special enough for the price I paid. The food was decent but not fulfilling. I ordered the full slab of ribs the first time I went expecting what I ordered, \"a full slab of ribs\" but no they give me a tiny container filled with what seemed to be a full slab of ribs from a piglet. What a joke! It was something like $25 and I also ordered it for dining in but they gave it to me to go. I was not satisfied at all. Also, the cornbread side they gave us was so small I thought that they'd shrunken a normal sized cornbread. Overall, I am not satisfied with the amount I received for what I paid but the food taste wasn't too bad. If you are not too hungry and are willing to pay for an overpriced \"meal\" then this is the perfect place for you.",

Pulled pork was very tasty on its own and not fatty. My favorite thing was ironically the chicken fingers. Nicely fried, great flavor. French fries and okra were very good too but stone cold. That just doesn't work. Collards were undercooked and awful. Green beans are the southern mushy style. Nice selection of sauces. Wish I could tell you about the hush puppies but none for us.

    "text": "First time trying this place for a quick family dinner on a Wednesday night. Our family loves BBQ and is always looking for consistent and great quality locations in our city. This was not it. First, I do not understand the 'ala carte ordering in a casual BBQ joint. Basic entrees range from $6- $14, but only include the meat? You can add two sides for an additional $4, or purchase individual sides. Odd, again for the type of restaurant this is. I ordered the 1/4 smoked dark chicken, collards and mac and cheese. Next to the meat, the sides- especially mac and cheese- are most important players in any BBQ eatery.This mac and cheese, was NOT adult mac and cheese, but rather, a minor step up from boxed cheesy mac. In other words, my four year old loved it, me and my husband, not so much. The collards were good...maybe a tab overloaded with pulled pork-- some people really look for that, so its not a horrible thing. My chicken was okay- not amazing, not terrible. So, with the  other BBQ options here in Charlotte, this will likely not be a spot that I hastily return to. At best, I may give it a second chance and try different menu items. My husband said his ribs were good, but again, not amazing.",

    "text": "First visit to this restaurant. Looked over past reviews and food sounded delicious. Just craved having ribs.  Ordered pork plate for my wife and slab of ribs with multiple sides as well as dessert. When I was called to the pick up area the girl was packing up the order. No ribs. She questioned the people cooking and they had to go back and look over the order. They went to their storage areas. No ribs. Went to other storage area. No ribs. Went into back. No ribs. Hey...we're sorry. Ran out of ribs. Choose something else I'm told. Looking over I see orders coming out for people coming in AFTER me. Couple of racks of ribs going out on their trays.   I looked back over the other reviews. Looks more like the rule rather than the exception running out of ribs. It was explained to me as well as in the other review they don't want to have left over food. Then again at 6:00 PM and the dinner crowd is coming in you want to have a substantial amount of food ready to serve. I can understand if it's close to closing time running out or supplier runs out. Not having it ready and serving later arriving customers very poor form and customer service.     Was so angry by the service I took the food for my wife but lost my appetite for dinner. Told I needed to come back sometime and try the ribs. Lol...are you going to have any to serve?  Other review even called in and told come and get them only to find out there were none. Very disappointing all around.   To all I would be careful going in with a desire for any particular food. You may be surprised that it won't be available when you get there.",

We would not drive out of our way again for it. On the plus side the hush puppies were good .  Sorry but we made be spoiled with a private place vs. a chain.",

If there are people behind you in the ordering line, you feel a lot of pressure to just order something off the incomprehensible menu board even if it is not really what the want.   The ditz taking my order was completely oblivious to the customer having trouble with the menu board, of course.   I got a pulled pork sandwich with vinegar slaw on it, and would have preferred a \"plate\" like at traditional Q places, but that is apparently not an option.   I certainly could not find it on the menu board disaster.  The food tasted good, hence one star, but the person who made my sandwich used a big spoon to dip out the slaw and put it on my sandwich, so all that excess liquid from the slaw got onto my sandwich.   After a couple bites, the top bun completely fell apart due to the liquid.  I had to eat my \"sandwich\" with a fork.  Problem could have been avoided by using tongs to dip the slaw, and letting it drain for a few seconds before putting it on.   Like I said, they have no concept of the customer experience.  My visit basically sucked.  I live nearby but I don't plan on going back.",

    "text": "I admit I'm a barbecue junkie. I just flat love good barbecue. When City Barbecue opened I was excited to try it but it seemed to always be crowded so it took until now for us to get around to it. Boy was I disappointed. First, I should have realized why the crowds are getting smaller. Second, I should have realized a problem when I got out of the car. You know that wonderful aroma you smell at great barbecue places. The sweet smoke smell of hickory, cherry or apple or the savory smell of mesquite. Well it's not here. I'm not sure what they smoke with but it has more of a smell than an aroma. The restaurant is laid out to efficiently move traffic through and seems clean and relatively attractive (are old license plates really necessary in all restaurants). The staff seems pleasant and only tried to hustle us through the ordering process a bit. Hint, If folks are holding back and looking up at the menu they are still trying to figure out what they want. Give them a minute.  I had been thinking about barbecue ribs all day so that's what I ordered. How disappointing. They were somehow both dry and greasy at the same time. I'm not sure how you do that but chefs tell me that comes form cooking the meat too fast at too high a temperature. I mentioned that to a manager and he told me to try one of the sauces so I did. Their sweet barbecue sauce is the consistency of peanut butter. It doesn't work with the meat in any way. It just sort of glops on top and sits there. It did nothing to add to the flavor or the texture of the meat. I think the most disappointing thing was the \"bark\". You know that wonderful caramelized layer of flavor all great barbecue has. Well this was like biting into an ash tray. The only taste was of soot. My wife loves pork barbecue.  Again it was greasy and dry. The texture was very stringy and you really had to work to chew it. The taste was not that nice hickory flavor that good pork barbecue has.  I don't know but I'm guessing oak? Our sides were very forgettable. The beans were undercooked and sort of crunchy. Instead of flavoring them with pork they used brisket? It just didn't work. The fries seemed like a bargain brand straight out of the freezer. When I talk about barbecue, I used to tell folks that the worst I ever had was wonderful. Now I can honestly say that I met a barbecue that I just didn't like.",

The selection of choices are plentiful and the people working there were very nice and friendly, the building is New and nicely done with plenty of outdoor seating, it will be great in the summer. The only \"gripe\" we had was the noise level was pretty loud but then again it was Packed @ lunch so if you prefer quiet, eat outside.
