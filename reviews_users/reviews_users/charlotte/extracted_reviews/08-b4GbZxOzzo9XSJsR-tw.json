They offer mini beignets which are \"ok\" - but I'd suggest skipping and ordering your meal - it comes quick, so there's no need for the \"breakfast appetizer\" ;) I think some of the staff came from Briggs, which is good - I always loved that place. I've never ordered the gluten free pancake here, but I hear it's fantastic - I always get the oh-so-reliable omelette.... Tasty and HOT! My son (toddler) gets the oatmeal and eats every last bite (it's the good oatmeal - none of that quick oats nonsense!",

They were not sunny  but I like eggs any way you can cook them so that was ok.  They don't have any wheat bread so the multi grain was very good.  The fresh OJ was awesome, bacon was crispy just liked I asked and the grits came with blackberries if you wanted.  Of course, I like trying new things so I had blackberry grits... The salty sweet taste was wonderful!!  So overall under $15.00... The OJ was almost $4.00 so not so bad.  I will be back.  They open at 7:00am!!!",

The problem was the \"Fresh\" orange juice was not fresh as the ones I'm more familiar with, but I did not wanted to make fuss out of it.  I almost flipped out of my chair when I got the bill.  $10.48 for bacon n eggs (little pricey), $7.78 for 2 small cups of Orange Juice????!!!!!

Because of that, when my family does breakfast, it is a large group of people (15+) that descend upon a restaurant and cause havoc for everyone involved.  With that being said, I found ABE a very nice break from the normal restaurant feel.   Upon walking into the restaurant, you realize that there are several rooms spread about the interior, giving a smaller restaurant feel when you are seated.  The menu is a little limited, however every one of the offerings we had were nicely prepared and seasoned properly.   The menu prices seemed a little on the steep side for breakfast, but as the food came out, I realized that the serving sizes were appropriate for the pricing.   All in all, everyone was quite pleased with the food that they received, and was extremely happy with the staff that took care of us.",

    "text": "Bleh... in almost every way.... bleh.  I never went to the Skillets that was here previously, so I can't compare it to that.  But I have eaten breakfast before, so I based my expectations on that.  If you are anticipating IHOP or Cracker Barrel portions, food or prices, this ain't your jam.  I don't think it was overpriced necessarily for the selection and options, but I do think it was overpriced for the quality and taste.    The young lady that seated me was very pleasant, and another woman that was walking around checking on people was nice as well.  My waiter was a little zzzz but competent, though my water was never refilled and once the food hit the table I didn't see him again.  The food: The Traditional with corned beef hash ($9) - from their menu this is 2 eggs any style, an english muffin and seasoned potatoes.  My 2 eggs were indeed over-well but were nothing special and seemed small, the english muffin was somehow hard and chewy at the same time and tasted odd, and the only seasoning on the potatoes was salt.  The \"butter\" that I put on my english muffin tasted off.  The potatoes seemed to be the standard frozen style small cut potatoes, but were well done, though overly salty.  The corned beef hash was horrible - I love corned beef, like LOVE it, I'll even eat the canned corned beef hash on occasion when I need the salty beefy potatoey stuff, but this was not good - not at all.  The meat was pulverized, but grainy (?), and mixed in the mash was tiny cut green and red peppers, onions, and I was told potatoes as well, but I didn't taste that at all.  It was fried crispy like I like, but after two bites I wasn't going to punish myself anymore.  Yuck.  Side of a sausage gravy biscuit ($3.49) - Relatively good, but I make better.  Biscuit held up well to the gravy, the 3 pieces of sausage were good.  Well seasoned.    The total (I had water to drink) was a little over $13 and absolutely not worth it.  The best part of the meal was the crushed ice in the water (I love crushed ice).  I could make everything I had better at home or jump on 485 and head to either Cracker Barrel or IHOP for better food.    \"I ain't goin' back.\" - Pawpaw C.",

    "text": "When this place was Skillets, we came on several occasions and it was always hit or miss. So, when we found out Skillets had closed and a new restaurant was coming in, we had high hopes that this place would be even better than Skillets. After my visit, I don't think that is going to be the case.   On my visit, the food was properly prepared and nothing was outright bad, but it wasn't great either.  It was ok. However, I thought the menu options were \"meh\" and the prices were a bit higher than other comparable breakfast/brunch places in the area.   I opted to go with the veggie omelet which included spinach, goat cheese, mushrooms, and diced tomatoes. (I think it was either 8.99 or 9.99) This comes with potatoes and an English muffin. The first couple of bites of my omelet were sort of bland because the ingredients were sort of clumped together instead of being spread throughout the omelet.  One thing that was disappointing is that it was sort of \"watery\" (?!) and I had to move my English muffin away from the omelet so it wouldn't get soggy... not good!  But as I got to the center of the omelet, I actually began to get some of the flavors from the goat cheese & veggies that improved the overall taste.  As the other reviewers have mentioned, the potatoes taste like bland frozen potatoes... definitely needs improvement! Also, the English muffin was \"meh\" as well. They should serve a better quality of English muffin.  Also, they don't leave the jams/jellies on the table, so you will have to request it.    On the \"plus side\", our service was pretty good, I thought the portion size was ok,  and we did not have a long wait to be seated.  Another plus is that they do not charge an upcharge if you want your omelet made from egg whites (many other places do charge extra for that).  I would consider giving this place another try if I had a great coupon or some other incentive. But quite honestly, I would be more inclined to go to Le Peep or Brigs before coming back here...",

    "text": "I was thrilled to see a new restaurant in the location Skillets had occupied on Community House Road. I was even more thrilled to find a coupon for a free omelette in my mailbox. So I decided to hike on over and take a taste. That was a mistake.  I took a seat at the counter and perused the menu. Omelettes and eggs benedict occupied most of the menu, all at prices of $10 and over. All of the omelette options were unusual and I didn't see a make your own option. As I watched food come out of the kitchen, it seemed very disorganized. The staff don't appear to have any system under control just yet.  I went with Stan's #1 - an omelette with shrimp, crawfish, ham mushrooms and cheese. It was not something I would normally order, but for free, I was willing to give it a shot, as I liked all of the ingredients in forms other than omelettes. I asked them to make sure the eggs were cooked, as i hate runny eggs. When the dish arrived, it was bone dry. The crawfish tasted old and the shrimp was about the only edible part of the creation. Unlike the omelette, the english muffin that came with it was not crispy. The highlight of the meal were the seasoned country potatoes, which were salty but good. Had I been paying for the dish, I would have sent it back and gotten something else.  When I got my bill, I was stunned to discover the charge for my unsweet tea was $2.69! Really?! So glad I got the to-go cup.   Because of the convenience of the location, I may try it again, but no more omelettes for me. Can't recommend this place at this time.",

The eggs weren't her favorite but the ham was a perfect match a little salt for her sweet. I got the crab cake and fried green tomatoes! Oh boy the spinach salad was good enough to have by itself I'll be ordering that again! My friends both got omelets southwest and lobster they enjoyed their food to say the least we had a great experience. Call ahead to get your name on the list if you're coming on a weekend as the brunch crowd has grown in the Charlotte area.",

The crabmeat was very greasy, or maybe it was from the abundance of cheese. It definitely wasn't worth over $10.  The service was pretty slow even though there was only one other table in the restaurant. I was just really upset that I paid so much for not being satisfied. I would not recommend.",

I think the price was because of the ingredients (crabmeat, asparagus, and steak) but not of the quantity or quality.   My real issue was the server at the counter. Not my assigned server, but the stringy haired brunette with the Santa Claus cap who's hair was not tied back and she ate at the counter, during her shift, in front of patrons and didn't wash her hands after. And she ate with her fingers and kept waving her hair back and forth. Girl, you ain't Beyonce or Becky. Yeah...  I considered saying something but I was with company and so I'm here sharing with you Yelp family.  I won't go back here and I'm disappointed that she was allowed to be so poorly behaved on the floor.",

    "text": "Ecclectic Creative Breakfast Menu  First time we went to an Another Broken Egg Cafe was earlier this summer in Vinings Ga when we went down for our Grandson's birthday and baptism.  Enjoyed it and since we were down in the Ballentyne area, decided to give this one a try as well.  Biggest difference between the Vinings locaiton and this one is the level of energy.  Vinings appers to be smaller and more crowded so the servers have to be more fast paced.  This location is bit more spread out and the pace of the service is a bit slower but this would only be a problem if you were on a tight time budget.  That said, it's not slow service but rather, you don't feel quite as rushed.  My wife ordered a Veggie Burger with a side of Fruit. She like both and was particulary pleased that the side of fruit had more than just melons in it.  In Vinings, she had had an omelet that was called a Floridian which looked great so I tired that for breakfast. It's a stuffed omelet with Cream Cheese as one of the filling and it was indeed very good.  It's a good menu and the food is well prepared and excellent service.  Ballentyne is a bit of a hike from Cornelius, but next time we are in the area, we will be back.",

    "text": "We finished a tax review meeting with our accountant working up an appetite for some comfort food to take the sting out of our tax due. Arriving at Another Broken Egg Cafe, we were greeted by our pleasant and bubbly server, Eloisa. The food was amazing! I enjoyed waffles topped with pecans, slices of fresh Brie cheese, and Raspberry Crisps (made with fresh raspberries and granola.) Served on the side were 2 perfectly poached eggs (medium soft yolks) served with extra crispy bacon strips (very crispy, to my delight and per my request.) My only criticism was that the maple syrup was watery (probably due to warming.) Eloisa quickly met my request to replace it with a lovely, thick honey to drizzle over the amazing waffle creation.  What a fabulous salty/sweet treat! Green tea accompanied it all, and was tasty and served in a lovely ceramic mug. A manager even came by to confirm our satisfaction. Great service and food!",

My fiance got the trio pancakes (one berry and two buttermilk) and they were rubbery and had no flavor at all. My mom ordered the Monterey omelet which also had no flavor and then her muffin was so cold that the butter wouldn't even melt. We ordered the beignets and they tasted like old grease and were hard. The only good thing on the table was the iced coffee to be completely honest. Our waiter was great but that's about it. Probably won't be returning because of the food quality. I will pay good money for a good meal but none of this was worth it!",

I almost always go with an omelette because you get a huge omelette, arguably some of the best home fries around, AND and english muffin. There's no way you're leaving hungry. But they also have a bunch of yummy sweet options if that's more your speed, and I swear one of these times I will try one of the benedicts or lunch options. I really don't think there is a bad option here.   The prices can get up there depending on what you get but in general the items range from $9-15 which I would say isn't absurd. The service was pretty great too, so between the atmosphere, service, and food I'd say it's worth it.",

I think we saw our waiter 3 times during the entire meal. We spent more time waiting for the food and later the check than actually eating. I ordered coffee, and the mug was cute, but the coffee was very average - definitely not worth $2.69. I also never got a refill :(   I ordered the Hey Lucy omelette because I saw the word avocado listed as an ingredient. It wasn't bad but could have used more filling (I tasted maybe two slices of avocado? sad.) They were pretty generous with the layer of cheese on top though. The overall portion size was great. The omelette came with toasted english muffin and potatoes.   I might come back when I feel like spending $16 on subpar service and slightly above average  food.",

My friend had the skinny omelet, which I didn't order because so often egg white omelets are tasteless.  This omelet looked & tasted delicious...filled with asparagus, goat cheese, baked whole cloves of garlic.  This omelet was accompanied by a generous fruit bowl and an English muffin.  We were able to converse easily and privately.  Our waitress, Eloisa, was attentive but not intrusive.  The manager/owner, Veronica, stopped by to make sure we were satisfied and we sang our praises!  I'm a good cook and baker and am fairly fussy about eating out...this will be my brunch go to from now on. I can't believe the negative reviews!!  We loved it!!! Thank you! Eileen J.",

We knew that a Saturday morning could be problematic so we called ahead to see if we could get reservations. The answer was no, but the waitress was able to put us down on the \"call ahead list\".   When we got there the place was packed, so I'm glad we did get on that list. We were seated right away and after ordering caffeine, everyone else ordered an omelet type dish, while I ordered my signature biscuits and gravy.   When the food came not too long after my meal also had an egg, English muffin, and bacon. The biscuits and gravy were ok, nothing to write home about. I was actually jealous of everyone else's and they all said they were good.   The bill ended up being around $15, which is kind of pricey for breakfast. I probably wouldn't come back for the biscuits and gravy, but i might try again for those omelets.",

We were totally turned off and planned to never visit again however one morning we saw that the old breakfast restaurant (which we didn't like) had change to Another Broken Egg & decided to try it in NC.  The service was good, the hostess was welcoming and prompt to acknowledge and sit us. We found some great options on the menu and the waiter was very accommodating. The food was not the best but it was food and edible. I had a egg white omelet with veggies and rye toast that came out untoasted which the manager quickly took it back and toasted the bread for me. My husband had the same and my daughter had the pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs with cheese and some bacon (she is the only pork eater in the family). I wouldn't make having breakfast here a DEFINITE but I wouldn't object if invited. I have other places that are much better with food taste within distance that I would eat at if I had a choice. However if in the area (on that block or in the parking lot) definitely check them out for breakfast food which is all that we tried.",

I love that they have healthy options like the delicious blueberry quinoa bowl and guilty pleasures like corned beef hash and grits topped with bacon and perfectly brown hash browns and gluten free options too if that's your jam.  An equal opportunist eater like me can appreciate this.  You must try the beignets at least once!  Yum... The orange and honey marmalade they serve them with isn't for everyone but it's tasty all the same.  I love that they have wifi that actually works so when I need a change of scenery to get some work done.  Be warned that it does get crowded during prime brunch times but the bar is always an option and hey, they serve coffee while you wait .  Last mention is they serve alcohol... Never a bad thing right?!",

    "text": "Decided to try Another Broken Egg Cafe while in the area. The staff was super friendly and the decor reminded me of a New Orleans cafe. The first time visiting this place; my order started with a mimosa and beignets. The texture of the beignets was harder than expected. They could've been more light and airy. It didn't scare me off! When the waitress came back I ordered the Hey Lucy! Omelette (cooked w/egg white) and it was delicious! The waitress excitement about how much she like the Hey Lucy! was a reason to try it. Also, I love avocado! The omelette is filled with breakfast chorizo (crumbed sausage), avocado, sauteed onions, and green chilies. Also, topped with cheese, side of English muffin, sour cream and salsa.   I decided to revisit Another Broken Egg with a friend because of my first experience. This time I ordered the Black Bean Benedict with another mimosa. The taste wasn't to my liking! The black bean benedict should be altered because it was to much going on with that dish.I sent it back!!! Just for the record the waitress was kind and understanding~ She simply asked if I would like to reorder and I did. My breakfast date ordered the Bananas Foster French Toast with coffee. The Banana Foster French Toast was amazing!!! The thick sliced Hawaiian bread was topped with a New Orleans-style Foster sauce, fresh bananas, pecans and whipped cream. SO DELICIOUS!!   So how did I come up with giving this place 4 stars? The overall experience was pleasant. Both times the staff was extremely friendly, the mimosa was on point, and the food was pretty good. I will definitely revisit this place over a few local breakfast restaurants/cafe. The plan during my next visit is to stick with what I enjoyed the most. I will reorder a mimosa, either a different omelette, simple eggs, grits, fruit, or even the famous Bananas Foster French Toast. Remember everyone preference of flavors in food is not always the same! By the way the mimosas are the best!!",

The wait staff was efficient in getting us seated, providing refills on beverages, and checking back to make certain everything was okay.  The food, however, was not quite as good as what I found at TOAST.  I ordered the vegetable omelet and was underwhelmed by how thin and sparse it was.  It was covered in goat cheese, which I am sure that I must have missed on the menu -  since I am not a fan of goat cheese.   The English Muffin was better than the little piece of toast at TOAST.  The grits were a tie!   Bright atmosphere and definitely family friendly as there was a noisy baby near our table.    Overall, less expensive than TOAST and I would recommend.",

Out of our three orders, two were incorrect and it took forever for our food to come. I'm going to give it another shot because I also was impressed with their variety of brunch cocktails - They had bloody Mary's, a variety of mimosa options and even spiked cold brew.",

I did so thanks to a BOGO coupon.  I ordered the Salmon & Raw Kale Salad and it was surprisingly good. The ample serving of  salmon steak was both seasoned and cooked well. The light dressing over the kale was sweet and tangy however I did encounter a few pieces with brown spots. Avoiding such  is always a challenge with kale even at home.  My buddy ordered the Sausage Chorizo Omelet with hash browns. Despite being a bit dry it was acceptable and plentiful.  Service was fair as waitress seemed young and inexperienced. Atmosphere was relaxed and attractive. It did exceed my expectations but in this case that means it was just fair to good. Glad I tried it but probably won't be back simply because there are just too many better options.",

Our waiter was very nice and efficient. It took what seemed like forever for our food to come out. more than 30 minutes for sure. I was not happy at all with my meal I ordered the fried green tomatoes and crab cakes. The tomatoes were decent but those flat skimpy crab cakes, they could keep em. They didnt serve V8 which was another negative. My niece asked for strawberries on top of her pancakes and they sliced cold strawberries and put them on top, she told him that she wanted more of the warm syrupy strawberry concoction. Overall I wish that I would have passed on this place. The one thing that was good were the grits other than that a definite miss, definitely not on our list for our \"Brunch with Bae\" dates.",

The beignets were good and served with a fruit jelly of some sort (they didn't say). I ordered the lobster brie omelet which came with potatoes or grits and an English muffin. I got potatoes which were perfectly crispy and so good! The omelet had cream cheese inside and lobster and brie on top...it was amazing!

The bathrooms were clean too. We ordered the beignets with coffee as a breakfast appetizer. The Honduran coffee was amazing. But the beignets are nothing like the authentic NOLA ones, but still good. Our food was delicious but the breakfast skillet has a smaller portion than before. We had one small issue with our biscuit and gravy being cold but they fixed it professionally and quickly. All in all, it's a great breakfast but a couple little improvements to our experience would've given it 5 stars.",

I ordered the city grits and a side of turkey sausage links. City grits were amazing. I'm not a huge grits fan but with all the added toppings to it, I couldn't resist. It has bacon, green onions and tomatoes on topped. I added a bit of hot sauce to it and it was amazing!! I will definitely get that again!! Turkey sausage links were good, but a bit pricey for what you got.   My husband got an omelette thought it was good. Came with potatoes. He added salsa to it and was pretty pleased. Our friend got got sausage and gravy biscuits with scrambled eggs and ate the whole thing. Our other friend got the benedict and loved it!!   I will definitely come back!",

My server was really nice, and actually started a conversation with me; probably since I was alone at the bar.  I ordered the Hey Lucy omelette which had breakfast chorizo, avocado, and cheddar cheese. It was served with sour cream and salsa on the side, and also an english muffin. I had the choice of potatoes or grits.  Honestly, I had a higher expectation for the food but it was still good.The only issue I had which is unorthodox was the speed that my food came out. Yes, it was warm but it was just a flag to me.",

We were in a back room since the party was so  large. I thought we would be there alone but they sat other people back there. I knew it was probably difficult for them as we we doing ice breakers and several conversations were going on at one time. I order the crescent city scrambler, a side of city grits and the mango kiwi mimosa. I will start with the mimosa since that came first. It was delicious. I would say stir it up before you drink it. The mango syrup sits at the bottom. The drink is mostly champagne (I am not complaining though) The crescent city scrambler was good. The portion size to me was small. I finished all my food which I never do. I also ordered a side of city grits. Everyone raved about in their reviews as the one good thing and it did NOT disappoint. It is flavored with bacon grease and had bacon crumbles. I mean do I need to say anything else. Overall the food was good. I would come back if someone asked to go. TRY THE CITY GRITS. I took some pictures of my neighbors food as well. ENJOY!",

I went in yesterday for lunch with higher than average expectations, just to be pretty dissapointed. Food was average at best. I'll take IHOP over this place any time. Skillets was much better. I ordered from the breakfast menu, two eggs over easy, home fries, toast and sausage patties. Average crowd for lunch. No wait. Place was half empty, so there should be no excuse for making mistakes. Sausage patties were two average tasting, squashed down, meatballs. One of the eggs came out broken and yolk fried hard. Instead of toast, I got english muffin. way too many mistakes on one plate and not so busy lunch. No quality control. No chef or food expediter should have ever let plate like that leave the kitchen. A form of a redemption came in the form of bringing out additional toast and giving me 50% off. All in all, with all the competition and choices around Ballantyne, if its up to me making a decision, I am not going back there.",

Got the black bean eggs Benedict with the chipotle hollandaise and, besides the poached eggs being underdone, the flavors were pretty good. Noticed the appearance of the potatoes on other tables walking in, so opted to substitute grits instead, and was so glad I did. We also ordered some of the biscuit beignets to share at the table, and they were pretty disappointing, the dough was extremely dense and heavy, and I couldn't get past the first one I ate. Also took a star off for the service. I'm not a fan of waiting by committee, and it lead to a lot of confusion, as we were left waiting for condiments, side orders, and drinks a little too long. For the prices they charge for a breakfast, I'd expect service to be a lot more on point.",

Mom wanted breakfast so I took here here since I've heard good things and pass it often in the evening (when the restaurant is closed.)  It took a few minutes to be acknowledged and seated.  Once seated, the server was quick with the drink order.  Unfortunately, the specialty coffee machine was broken.  The food was fresh and delivered within ten minutes.  I got the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was flavorful and crispy, unfortunately a bit dry and over cooked.  Then waffle was sweet so I ate it with butter only.  I don't review other people's food but in this case I will.  My mom had the Floridian omelet which is a cream cheese filled omelet topped with crab meat.  My mom didn't like the crab so I tasted it.  It tasted old or like it was close to being spoiled.  She let our server know and my mom got a replacement omelet without the crab.  The server gave a discount on the omelet so she was charged for a cheese omelet.  I will definitely think of visiting this place for breakfast or brunch in the future.",

Food took forever and when we did get it, it was not that great. Manager came over and comped our drinks and that was it. Just horrible I won't be returning it was so bad. It's saddening that a place this good has gone downhill so fast. Good bye broken egg!",

Set aside the fact the guy at the host stand and man who started as our server, but never came back after taking our orders, were very strange. We ordered chicken and waffles and the shrimp and grits. The shrimp and grits were probably four stars but the chicken and waffles were one star at best. There were four pieces of chicken which were about the size of women's finger and a waffle which was out of a box. The chicken and waffles seemed as if they were from a fast food restaurant.   Go to Terrace Cafe for the same price.",

I had the Lobster Brie omelette, fruit and and English Muffin and my boyfriend has the Mardi Gras Omelette, toast and City Grits. Everything was fresh and came out quickly. The Lemon Blueberry Mimosa was great as well. I'd recommend for brunch or a quick bite.",

The restaurant is open for breakfast and lunch features a wonderful assortment of dishes from specialty pancakes , waffles,  a variety of egg dishes,  breakfast cereals and yogurts,  and sides such as biscuits, grits, country potatoes, and a variety of sausages etc.  Brunch features burgers and salads and other brunch specialties such as crab cakes, chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits and specialty omelettes etc. Menu prices moderate, good portions, food plated nicely came out hot. Our breakfast bill for 2,  was around $35. Our waiter was friendly and accommodating and offered to suggest customer favorites. The atmosphere comfortable. We both ordered the smoked salmon benedict on a bagel which was delicious. The coffee was great but pricey.  As a matter of fact the coffee cups were made in the US and were on sale for about $19 a coffee cup and $25 for a cappuccino cup. We would certainly return  agian and try another menu choice for a special breakfast. A kids menu is also available. I read other reviews but ours was very positive with our visit.",

We were seated in a back room where the tables were literally right up against each other. There was no on right next to us so I thought it would be ok. 5 mins later they sat someone right up against us. I don't understand this... Why do hostesses think anyone wants to sit right against another full table. My back was literally 1 inch from the guy next to me. Very uncomfortable!   We ordered our food.. I got a French toast combo and the wife got an omelette and potatoes. The potatoes were tasteless.  They basically were just French fries with no seasoning. Horrible. The omelette was just bleh...  French toast was also just bleh.. Had no taste at all. The homemade sausage patties were ok, but way over seasoned. They tasted more like a meatball. Very weird. Everything was just barely ok... But far from good.    The only thing I liked was the coffee.   Total bill for my wife, 2 young kids, and myself was over $50. Way overpriced for breakfast... Especially a tasteless one.   I wouldn't recommend or go back.",

It took almost 40 minutes to get my food, and in the time I was waiting I never received a refill on my drink although it was empty for some time.  I never even saw my waiter once while I was waiting for my food.

We walked in, were promptly seated and ordered coffee. Only then did we look at the menu. What a disappointment. Overpriced fancy shmancy dishes mostly slathered in cheese. Basic eggs, hashbrowns and toast were not to be seen. That's a meal that would be under $5.00 at a good diner up North. We decided we would not eat there and just pay for the coffee. When the bill came it was just shy of $6.00 for two cups of coffee (and not very good coffee). We payed it and left vowing never to return. Sadly, I can't speak to the quality of the food as we never got that far. There must be a good greasy spoon somewhere down here. We'll keep looking.",

I did a substitution of the side and they charged me nothing extra.  The food was fast, hot, and had all the accompanying ( butter, salsa, etc) right there in good size containers.  It is not a cheap place.  $2.69 for coffee.  The waitress did keep it filled for me.  Overall, I will be back, but I don't see this as a regular morning stop.

My beef and seafood benedict just . . . wasn't. The English muffin was soggy and rubbery. The crab/seafood mixture was awfully 'fishy' and the hollandaise sauce was really REALLY lemony and didn't sort well at all with the crab/seafood mixture. The beef was very good but didn't really make up for the soggy rubbery English muffin. All in all just not good. I'm aware that some of this may just be me ordering poorly. But I've had lots of benedicts in lots of different places and the good ones always have a nice cutable with a fork English muffin. I'm very willing to try them again and am totally open to giving them 4 stars but for now I'm going to go with 3. They are also a bit on the expensive side 40 something dollars for breakfast for two and an appetizer seems a bit much. But it is Ballantyne so . . yeah. I'll be back (if for no other reason for the beignets) but so far I'm not really whelmed by anything else.",

They have a good menu with a variety of different options......but we don't see ourselves wasting a whole morning just going to breakfast.  They need to get their act together and run more efficiently or they will go out of business.",

They have regular indoor seating, bar seating, and it looked like outdoor seating as well.   I had a hard time deciding what I wanted. Was having a serious battle between sweet and savory. They had bananas foster pancakes, cinnamon roll french toast, biscuits, and even sandwiches to name a few.   I got the biscuits and gravy per recommendation of my friend I was with who had been here before. I also got potatoes and sausage patties as my side. For my drink I had an apple cider mimosa  I thought the biscuits and gravy was delicious. The biscuit was super soft and the gravy was thick. The sausage patties had so much flavor to them and you could tell they were formed from scratch. I thought the potatoes had a nice crispiness to them.   I am only deducting a star because our waitress wasn't that attentive in my personal opinion.   Other than that I will definitely find my way back and I recommend them.",

I had the peach cobbler pancake and it was so good. The grits were served hot, in a large portion sized cup and were also super good.   Con: I accidentally ordered the Huevos Rancheros over the Southwestern scramble because I was looking at both on the menu. When it came out I wasn't a fan at all and sent it back to trade for the scramble. I don't eat meat so when I ordered the first time I said no chorizo. The second time I assumed the waitress would remember no meat but when it came out it had chorizo scrambled in to it with no way to pick it out. I didn't want to send the dish back again and be a pain so I just didn't eat it. My friend ended up packing it to go.   Although my experience this time around wasn't the best I would definitely come back here to try something else.",

Glad we came when we did because mid-way through (around 9:30am), there was a much longer wait.   Michelle, our server, was kind, patient and helpful. You're offered doughnuts and beignets for the table when you're seated. We had to pass today but we won't next time.   Being a lover of seafood, I was excited to see a lobster and Brie omelet and had to try it. I was not disappointed. Large pieces of sweet lobster were on top of my omelet filled with Brie. Delicious lobster in every bit. I did order mine without tomatoes and onions because we were heading to church. You can either choose potatoes or grits for a side and I selected potatoes. The omelet also comes with an English muffin. My only complaint is that my omelet was cooked a tad bit overdone but it was still very good.   Hubby had an omelet and our sons had pancakes. Everyone was happy. Be warned: the pancakes are rather large. Our ten-year-old orders from the adult menu and two pancakes were more than enough.   Very nice way to start my Sunday and we will be back.",

My waitress did not seem to mind that I sat for an extra bit with my laptop (free wifi!) while drinking a third cup of coffee.  I chose the huevos rancheros for brekkie, after I'd already enjoyed a half order of their beignets. The beignets were tasty (covered in powdered sugar) and still hot, but a little too hard for my taste. Not light at all. The eggs arrived shortly after. Properly cooked and with the usual black beans and spicy cheese and salsa, on top of two grilled tortillas. I found the tortillas to be way too hard from being grilled, so after fighting with them and a knife, I opted to slide them out and ignore them. The home fried potatoes mixed into the eggs and beans and salsa were excellent and I enjoyed the rest of my meal.  Great service from Emma and a good meal.",

    "text": "I came for brunch over the weekend and the service was good. The food was just okay.   I ordered the Hey Lucy omelette which comes with avocado, chorizo, onions, green chilies and then topped with cheddar jack cheese.   Well...mine didn't have the cheese (see photo) but overall the dish was just missing something. It comes with a side of salsa and sour cream but i still needed something more. Seasoning? Flavor? For my side, I chose the country potatoes and they were cold - but I did sample the city grits so if I return I'd chose that side instead of the potatoes.   Overall, the food for me was just two stars. But everyone was so friendly so I threw in an extra star. But this wouldn't be my main brunch spot.",

To my dismay, this location didn't satisfy my cravings. I ordered the same dishes (i.e. Crawfish Bowl, City Grits, and Biscuit Beignets) and was disappointed. The presentation of the bowl was not appetizing, the grits were kind of lumpy, the beignets were fried too long and were crunchy. I gave this location 3 stars because our pitcher of Mimosa was good and the service was decent. I expressed my displeasure with the beignets and these were taken off the bill. Still a fan of the restaurant,  but not a fan of this location.",

    "text": "My fiance and I came here for lunch today and it was pretty good. I wasn't blown away, but I would come back. The menu was pretty big. They specialize in brunch/breakfast and the menu leans very heavily towards breakfast options. I wouldn't come here if you're looking for a lot of healthy options - even their \"sensible selections\" section of the menu had items with 1000+ calories. I got the skinny omelet with the goat cheese on the side. I ended up not even using the goat cheese as the omelet was good without it. My meal came with an english muffin and fruit salad. My fiance got the open face breakfast reuben with a side of potatoes off their seasonal menu. His sandwich was very good and very filling if you're looking for something big. The potatoes were just ok. They have a very large cocktail menu - we didn't try anything since we had to go back to work - but I would consider coming back on a Saturday or Sunday to try some of their drinks. The space was nice - cozy, bright, and welcoming. Our waitress and the hostess we're both very friendly and helpful. Once we were seated we got our drinks and food very quick - making it a good spot if you're looking for a sit down restaurant to go to on your lunch break.",

    "text": "ABEC is usually good, but lately, with the restaurant being overcrowded, the quality of service AND WORKERS has gone all the way downhill. More than likely never to return to being good. This morning, as many Sunday mornings, I called in my order. Same as usual, Bacon, Egg & Cheese on toasted bread. The only thing I asked for in regards to the eggs, are Egg Whites. They can never get it right, So when I get  back home, I am sorely disappointed!!!!  So today, I arrive 10 minutes AFTER (late) the girl said the order would be ready. Since I know how they roll over there with counter service. I land at the front counter, and as always there is no host behind the counter because the place is PACKED with people standing inside and outside. Usually my food is sitting there next to the computer, waiting for me. Not this time. I did overhear that they are short staffed and people are always calling out.  OK, so now, there are workers all over the place and one guy comes behind the pick up counter to go to the  ordering computer/system. He looks at me and keeps it moving. Never once asking if I need anything. Never really recognizes that I am standing there looking stupid, for assistance, but he keeps it moving. The same with ALL the girls at the intake counter, right behind me. I mean if I am standing there looking like I need help, do they even offer any? NOPE!  I contemplated to myself, if I should just walk out & leave and let them eat the  food themselves and waste my order. Since there was no service to me.  So, after about 10 minutes of standing there looking stupid, I turn around and ask the girl (the same one that I have seen  all the time standing there, and she saw me looking stupid) if my order for pickup is ready. She asks my name. I mean come on! She goes to talk to a woman who brings two bags from the back out. It wasn't that she thought I ordered the pancakes w. Syrup...no. It's that the fool who ordered pancakes are going to get home and realize they are probably ICE COLD!!! Oh yeah, that person wasn't there either! He/She probably tipped them  about $10.00 extra for the \"great\" service. LMAO!  Ok, so now on to the order itself. I mean it comes up to the same amount every time: $8.22. This time I opted NOT to give a tip on the receipt! And do you people notice that's the first thing they look at when you hand them back the signed receipt??? And I wonderfully walked out!  Ok, for the past few months, it's been the same kind of \"service\" at this place. And it all seems to be ok, judging by the clientele that comes in, they have no problem with being overlooked! NOT me!  So as usual when I get home and open the carton, the sandwich is warm. Decent. Now, let's look at THE CONTENTS...The sandwich is cut diagonally. However, I notice this doesn't have egg whites. Just regular yellow eggs. Usually the bacon is blackened to a crisp - literally burned. Not today. It's just overcooked and really crispy (almost burned) to the bite. Now as upset as I am, I'm not going to make a scene, since I am home..lol. I go to break apart the sandwich, but notice that the bread on both sides is positioned WRONG (upside down)! It's cut diagonally on the bottom ( top of bread facing right), but the top piece (top of bread facing left) , it's completely turned in the opposite direction. So, it doesn't match up. Which means they have stupid people working there!  Now I am hungry.  I just paid $8.22 and I am going to eat it.  I know a man made my food, because women are not disoriented like this. They are very precise and organized and orderly about things. And can I tell you out of every restaurant I went to in this Ballantyne/Piper Glen area where men prepared something, I have been disappointed EVERY TIME! The men that work in these places have no skills in the kitchen out here (most recently Applebees across from my apt on Piper Station Dr.).  AND I AM A MAN!  I really need to return to cooking @ home. But I'm a single man who lives alone, with no nagging wife or spoiled kids. I expect the best when I order out.  I can't do this with this place anymore..I'm done! I will gladly continue to go to my lil Light-rail  Diner on Sharon Lakes Rd and South Blvd! That place gets it RIGHT EVER YTIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Never a disappointment!  Maybe because the workers are EXPERIENCED and older. These young people are a lost cause!  UGH!",

Poached eggs were underdone, the whites were runny....returned and cooked right. Pancakes and waffles also good. Strange though, if you want real maple syrup its an extra $1.59.  Overall, this place is just ok. If you go on weekends, the wait time can be 45 mins.",

The gluten free pancake with berries was great! Kids had typical pancakes and eggs- neither really ate well, but they are kids and you can't always count on them to be big eaters. The older child asked for chocolate chips on her pancake and they happily obliged. Only draw back, I had to ask for a refill of coffee every time, and the children's drinks got ignored completely. Though otherwise it was great!!!",

The after church crowd rushes in around 10:30am on sundays, so be cautious of that. Staff is super friendly and helpful, they don't rush you out even though there's a ton of people waiting to be seated. The food is delicious and filling. I actually don't like stand alone egg dishes where you see a the yolk, whites or scrambled together, but I heard great things so I wanted to try. It was VERY limited if you are looking for something besides egg. Had the Sweet Potato Pancake. The spiced pecans had too much spice, nutmeg maybe? Made it unappetizing. Can't really taste the sweet potato either, and pricy for one layer of pancake!  The Biscuit Beignets, however, were so delish. Split those things in half and spread the warm marm on top and you're in heaven. I'd go back only for the beignets.  Unless I turn into an egg eater.",

As was consistent with my first experience, the service was poor including earning the attention of the server, the accuracy of our order, and the quality of the food.  Once we were approached by a server she took our drink orders and returned with three out four drinks as correct.  Additionally, she provided my 6 year-old daughter a large, adult cup rather than one with a top.  Once our food arrived, my wife and I both noted ours was very cold (but was supposed to be hot).  My order was incorrect and when pointed out to the server, she returned with the wrong side item again yet charged me for the higher priced side item I didn't receive.  Frankly, I'm shocked they remain in business given what I expect is a consistent experience for other patrons.  I know with certainty that I will not visit this restaurant again.",

We ordered some beignets to share and they were delicious! I had the Southwest Scrambler, an omelette with breakfast chorizo, onions tomatoes and green chilis all topped with cheddar jack cheese. It also came with sides of salsa, guacamole and tortillas.  It was so yummy! I had the country potatoes for my side, which were ok. Next time I would try the city grits my colleague ordered....they looked wonderful. Overall a great experience!",

Every restaurant in the city is packed to the rafters, and everything suffers (food, service, etc.).  No restaurant is a positive experience on Sunday mornings here.",

It literally comes out of the kitchen's sink and has strong notes of chlorine, fluoride, copper, and other minerals characteristic of bad tap water. I couldn't even mask the foul taste with a lemon.   Owners, if you're reading this, please, we're all begging you, invest a small amount of money in a water filter. It makes a huge difference in the taste of the water - and it is healthier for you, too.",

    "text": "My husband went to Another Broken Egg in Louisana and really liked it.  So, he was excited to see them expanding into Charlotte.   When we heard that this location and South Park had both opened, we read the reviews on both and decided to try South Park first based on the unfavorable reviews for this location.  (I've posted a review for the South Park location, too)  However, when we received a Coupon deal, we decided to give this location a try since it's significantly closer to home.   We're so glad we did!   The service was excellent and the food was delicious!   Thankfully, we didn't experience any of the issues that have been posted here!  My husband and I are trying watch our waistlines so we decided to share a dish.  We had the Huevos Rancheros and it was delicious and more than enough for us to share.  We also ordered a side of fruit and was pleasantly surprised by the fruit selection...fresh raspberries, sliced cantaloupe, sliced kiwi, and sliced pears.  The fruit was very fresh and quite substantial for a \"side\".   The coffee was also quite good.  Next time we visit, I will be sure to take a picture of the Heuvos Rancheros to post here.  It looked as fantastic as it tasted!    Our server was very friendly and attentive.  She was also happy to answer the handful of questions that we had about the menu.   During our meal, the Manager also stopped by our table to check on us and to ask if we enjoyed our meal.  She was very friendly, too!  The prices here are comparable to other local breakfast restaurants.  So, no complaints there either.   I do need to say...I wish that Yelp had the option of giving a 1/2 star, because I probably would have gone with 4.5 stars instead of 4 and only for one reason....all of the food is fresh, but it appears that the breakfast potatoes are not made fresh.  Don't get me wrong, they were still very tasty and we ate them all, but fresh potatoes really would have kicked the rating to 5 stars for me.  So let me say...in my opinion, this should be a 4.5 star rating, but that wasn't an option...so I need to go with 4 stars.  If they had fresh potatoes, the rating would have been 5 stars.  We've been searching for a go-to breakfast place for several years and it looks like we may have found it.  Finally!    I can only hope that our future visits will be as good as our first one was.  (Keeping fingers crossed!)",

We were finally  seated  this 2nd go around after waiting 20 minutes when we were told 5 min wait on the phone. (We were in the parking lot)  Our 1st server (yes 1st server) took our drink order and after she served them, became \"too busy\" to take our order, so someone else obliged us.  Our food arrived luke warm. Did I mention that we were told several  times that the kitchen was closing in 5 minutes frequently? This is where I grew a disdain. We arrived at 1:10pm... waited to be seated for approximately 20 mins...after being told it was a 5 min wait. Server situation took an additional 20-25 mins. Now the server  has mentioned at least 4x how the restaurant closes SOON.  I give every place a 5 starting out. As the visit progresses, whatever happens dictates my ratings. I allowed myself to get excited about a mediocre restaurant just by reading the menu online. NEVER DO THAT!  I will not recommend this establishment to anyone. My Bloody Mary was the silver lining. So disappointed!  TODAY: Better service and no wait time is what the difference was. Other than that, the lobster brie omelette tastes more like imitation crab and brie. The brie was sliced thickly this visit which overwhelmed everything else. The temperature of the food was served luke warm again.  I can't seem to win with this location. I actually have given up. No more attempts to be made.",

The omelet was mediocre. Looked like something I could make at home. And they just kind of threw some parmesan cheese on top instead of cooking it into the omelet or even inside the fold. Also i couldnt find a single Garlic Clove. No effort at all. I saw some other omelets that I'd like to try on the menu but the little omelet I got today came to $12 & wasn't even that great.

It was the favorite part of our entire meal but not free so you have to pay for them (I would eat the whole plate myself if they were free). Hubby went with the Floridian omelet that comes with breakfast potatoes. He had a side of Andouille sausage and was very pleased with his meal. I went all out and had the Cinnamon roll French toast, which was delicious as well. The hand glazed mugs they use for coffee are very cute and you can purchase them. My only complaint is that it was a very expensive breakfast with the sides we ordered, and not something we would do all of the time.",

I got an omelette which was very good- also liked their potatoes and andouille sausage.  The gluten free pancake and egg scrambles were also great. If you go, do NOT pass up the beignet appetizer! It was very popular at our table! Looking forward to trying more options here.",

Unfortunately, I just didnt particularly  care for the food or the service.  I went the first time with my entire family to try it out, I  ordered the crab cake benedict... I was very disappointed... in fact I didn't eat it all.  The service was mediocre.. In passing and on the way to taking my daughter to work one morning I thought I would give this location another try... Why?? I should have learned from the initial visit . My daughter and I both felt the same way.  The waitress seemed as if she wasn't really interested in serving us and the food was really not all that good.",

    "text": "We are liking Another Broken Egg.  A kitchy country kitchen motif serving lunch and breakfast.  And it is convenient to my father's assisted living digs and St. Matthew Church.  We like the menu.  Lots of suggestions and creative omelets.  And they will create what you like better or want modified on their menu.  Service is prompt and the food comes out hot and as described.  Endless coffee and iced tea makes for a good leisurely breakfast or lunch.  Given the fine location in Ballantyne, Sunday is a mob scene with the various church crowds coming in on schedule.  Waits will run up to 45 minutes, but you end up sitting with nice people to pass the time.  A nice place. Worth the weekend waits.  Enjoy.",

    "text": "We drove around looking for something new to try for breakfast, and happened upon here. It was a Saturday morning, and we had to wait about 30 min. for a table. Our server was very attentive and friendly, although a bit forgetful in getting a couple of extras. We tried the beignets, and, as others have mentioned, they really weren't that good. They were hard and tasted slightly burnt. The Eggs Benedict were good, nothing special. The Southwest Scrambler (with soft tortillas) was pretty delicious, and the salsa was a standout. The home fried potatoes were good. We got a Mother's Day coupon so we may go back one more time as we want to try the Huevos Rancheros with the salsa. Side note: we asked if they had tomato juice (most places do not), and they offered V8. Upon arrival, the server told us we got the last 2 glasses as it was being discontinued.",

    "text": "I am all about breakfast and brunch... I am also guilty of doing \"breakfast\" for dinner on occasion.  Another Broken Egg has been on my radar for a while and I have had several visits.  Each visit has never disappointed.  I do remember this place was another breakfast place at one point, but it seems that the new owners put their own touches to the place.  The wood paneling (originally just natural, stained wood) is painted with warm cozy colors.  The tables are copper with wood trim and are very clean.  It's almost like the place gives you a nice, grandma style hug to welcome you in.  They do have a rather extensive menu, but their signature items are marked with a small broken eggshell icon.  I highly recommend the shrimp and grits!  Also the Benedict Oscar is super awesome.  I'm a bit obsessed with poached eggs (mostly because I can't do them myself at home.... yet), but toss in some steak, asparagus, crab, and Bearnaise sauce, and you get one hell of a breakfast!  The servers are super super nice and just always a treat to eat here.  Probably my only complaint would be how popular the place can get so there could be a substantial wait depending on when you get there in the morning during peak breakfast weekend hours.",

I ordered Bellini to drink and watched as a woman, ON THE PHONE, tried to make it. She poured a few things in and dropped a frozen peach in, looked at my server and shrugged. Needless to say worth the $8.00 price tag. I am pretty sure the one who made it was the manager.   I had the Lobster and Brie Omlette which was not bad. Not worth $15 but not awful. The grits, on the other hand, were great!.  Overall, I say skip this place and go to Toast or Flying Biscuit. You will have better service and better food.",

I take my little princess out for breakfast this morning and had my heart set on the Yogurt and Fruit parfait.....a little pricey, but something I enjoyed.  They changed their menu and pulled it off.  Now, they have the fancy Chobani something or other.  $9.99 for a dollop of vanilla Chobani with some blueberries and strawberries mixed in.  It was in an overly sweet bakery type shell which was tasty, but dammit I'm tryin' to eat healthy.  They add some stale, out of season fruit to the plate and drizzle some honey on the plate to try and justify the price.  The value wasn't really there on the former Yogurt Fruit Parfait, and now it really isn't there.    My daughter got the pancakes and we asked to add powdered sugar and whipped cream to it.  They NEVER remember the add on's but they do fix it.  I guess there's no button on their screen.  The service was lackluster and slow this time and I had to wait too long between \"touches\" which I guess was right on target with the experience.  I had a coupon from the City Pass book which I guess was a bright moment that I didn't wind up paying $40.00 for 3 people to eat breakfast.  Goodbye Another Broken Egg.....It's not me, it's you.",
