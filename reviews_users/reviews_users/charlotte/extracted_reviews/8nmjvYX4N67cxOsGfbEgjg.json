    "text": "Studio Movie Grill is like a sad shell of what Mez used to be.  While Mez had it's problems before Studio Movie Grill took over (Paying higher price for regular seating, they called it \"Premium Seating\"), SMG added a host of other issues.  First I'll hit on some positives and as to why I didnt rate it as 1 star.  We bought the $5 Groupon, and ordering tickets online was a breeze, and picking your seats beforehand is a really good idea and I think that movie theaters should all implement some sort of seating arrangement so that you don't walk in to the theater with 5 people only to find that you have to split up or sit in the very front row.  The web experience is awesome.  Now...on to the concerns.....I thought at first that the idea of a movie/dinner hybrid would be a good idea.  I was wrong.  I went to this theater twice after buying the Groupon.  The first time, when I got to my seat, it was covered in a white powdery liquid, like someone had a baby and it upchucked on the seat or something.  We told one of the waiters just to see if we could get it cleaned or get a towel or something to sit on...and then they said they would be right back.  So I stood....and waited...and waited.....20 minutes went by before I grabbed another staff member and asked them to clean it.  After that I waited another 10 minutes before a staff member came by with what looked like a spray bottle and a paper towel and tried to spray it down.  No luck.  All the waiter said was \"Thats pretty gross, I wouldnt sit there either.  Sorry, theres not much I can do\".....NOT \"Let me see if I can find you another seat\" or \"We are sorry, have a free movie on us\"  or anything.  It was just \"suck it up and sit in the goo, or go home\".  My wife slid over in her seat and we pretty much shared one seat for the entire movie.  Upon leaving, we had our parking \"validated\"...meaning one of the staff members looked at the ticket, acted like she was doing something to it, and then handed it back.  When we left the parking garage, we found out that it WASNT validated, all the staff member had done was just write an X on it or poked a hole in it or something.  We had to pay an extra $10 for parking.  The second time we went was just as unpleasant.  This time we were able to get seats that were decent.  We got to our seats, and placed our order, which was just popcorn and a soda.  That was all we ordered.  About 10 minutes later, the guy next to me ordered a hamburger and a couple other things.  20 minutes later, once the movie started, the guy who ordered the hamburger received his meal.  We were still waiting.  It wasnt until 30 minutes into Iron Man 3 (1 hour later!)  and after checking with the staff on the status of the popcorn that we finally received it.  Well, then we bit into the popcorn, and it was the absolute saltiest thing I had ever tasted.  I love salty foods, I put salt on a lot of my food.  This was unbearably salty...like the kind where it almost stings your mouth.  I took two bites and tried to flip the popcorn over, because I thought that maybe the bottom half would be less salty.  Didn't work.  I dont normally send things back unless they are unbearably bad....I sent it back and asked for a lot less salt.  10 minutes later, we get the popcorn again, this time it had NO SALT at all.  We just ate it anyway.  On top of all that, my wife missed half the movie trying to fix our salt situation.  Having the waiters and waitress going up and down the stairs with their iPhone/ordering devices was also extremely distracting.  We had better experiences at Northlake or Concord Mills theaters.  We probably wont be going back to SMG.  Overall, Mez just seemed more upscale.  While the ticket prices were sometimes outrageous there, SMG seems like a cheap knockoff.  The atmosphere is very different then Mez.  Mez was more like an upscale club that had a nice theater attached.  SMG feels like a cheap movie theater that happens to have a restaurant, and they don't know quite yet how to make the two work together well.  We went to Mez several times just to eat at the restaurant.....After seeing the food at SMG and experiencing the service, I doubt we'd go just for the food.",

I can be understanding about that though, because our theatre was pretty full, and if the kitchen is cooking for 15 theatres, it's going to take a while. Unfortunately, my burger and fries were lukewarm/cold, as was the popcorn :( So I didn't finish either... The seats were super comfortable and the venue was very interesting and fun- as others mentioned, I would go here for the movie (maybe a dessert/drinks), but not food. It wouldn't be a cheap night either way.",

    "text": "Went last night, 8/7 and saw my first movie there. Bought tickets on Groupon which was a great deal. Paid the extra fee to reserve seats online, glad we did because line to get tickets was very long. Seats were super comfy and movie theater had a great ambiance about it. We ordered popcorn and 2 drinks and that took about 20 minutes to get to us. They brought checks out about 30 minutes before the movie ended, put our debit card in and handed back to server. The movie ended and we still did not have our check and debit card back. We had to go and track down our server, as with half of the movie theater. That was a nightmare in a theater. Overall, seats were great, food was good, but service not so much. Haven't decided if I will return or not..   -The validate your parking ticket which is a huge plus though!",

    "text": "The movie experience has been thoroughly compromised. I loved this place because it was a great place to not run into mall-rat kids, annoying people kicking the back of your seat, all the good seats taken by people who camped out, etc etc, and to be able to watch a first rate movie in peace and comfort for a bit of a price premium. A full bar was icing on top of actually watching a movie in an experience that was as good as being at home.  The most crucial thing is these new anti-theft 3D glasses by Dolby are huge, uncomfortable, and most importantly very dirty and reflective (The individually wrapped Real-D ones were far better and CLEAN). After first putting a very dirty set back and grabbing a new pair they still were covered in prints, After a thorough scrubbing to try to get the obvious finger prints off of my vision I was left with a Vaseline covered goop around the corners of the screen and tunnel vision. The lights are kept fairly high so the servers can walk around, the problem is these reflective lenses gave me a very good view of my own eyeball and the lights to my periphery, further obscuring my vision of the movie. I felt like a fool but the only solution I found was to stick my movie ticket in-between the glasses and my temple creating a blinder that fixed one lens. When possible I took them off and ignored the blurry backgrounds. Double vision was better than a dim blurry mess.  Food and drink is great... but meaningless if the movie experience is ruined.  Servers have walk-e-talkys chirping during the movie taking you out of it, their ordering system seemed to be a glowing white smartphone. Why not install a red filter on them? The color red does not affect night vision nor distract near as much. Similarly, give them red flashlights and turn the lights back down to movie levels. They are good at ducking out of the way but that doesn't solve everything.  I won't review the food but I was dismayed to see the drink selection was no longer local microbrews like OMB Copper, but now a slew of major national names (and for some reason Sweetwater 420, yuck).  Sadly it looks like next time I will be back at a major chain with the mallrats. Or better yet, staying home and busting out my own growler of Copper.",

    "text": "FYI - to anyone who has appreciated having a nice movie theater uptown, strike it off your list of accomplishments.  SMG has really made some terrible terrible changes.      The new aisles SHOULD be a nice improvement, as they pretty much prevent the need to cross in front of anyone in their seat, but they selected LED lights on them that brightly shine directly at your eyes during the whole movie. That problem is intensified by the fact that THEY DON'T CLEAN the 3D glasses between uses.  Mez used the type in plastic bags that were processed and cleaned for next use, but now you just set them on a table and they rely on a minimum wager to 'clean' them, which they don't do well.  So I had grease smudges on the glasses that pretty much made the lighting glare worse.   It was a huge relief that they kept the old seating, as that was a major plus for the Mez theater.  However, to fit with SMG's [terrible] business model of having 'waiters' IN the theater, they added a swivel table with a call button on top of the old small surface on the armrest.  These effectively block the drink holders, which caused at least one person in my movie to drop and smash her glass (must have been alcohol, as they now serve regular drinks in plasticware).  They also cause the eating surface to be very high and uncomfortable.  I'm 6'1 and my friend is 6'3 and we both noticed the discomfort of the table height so I'm sure average people will dislike it too.  I actually found it a worse experience to eat WITH the tables than simply with the seats how they were at Mez with my plate on my lap or on the arm rest tray.     Then comes the business model that SMG is pushing, which I have comparatively realized is completely horrible compared to Mez.  You have 'waiters' coming up to take your order IN the theater.   That means unlike before where you made your menu selections and orders outside in the lobby with a buzzer to pick it up, you now must look through the menu in the dark and then attempt to order the meal to fairly unprofessional and unskilled waiters, who then enter it into a smartphone app.  Of course it is nice to have the food runners bringing your food to your seat, but that could have been easily added to a process of deciding and ordering at the bar like before and giving them your seat number.   There were lots of SHHHHH's during the moving because of the process, not to mention it being more likely to have people walking around the theater.    It also took uncomfortably long for them to even come when you press the button, so it isn't likely that the process saves you time.   It is an extremely inconvenient convenience.   Lastly, the food is absolutely goddam terrible.   I will never plan to eat there again.  So they have put up tons of tacky infrastructure and employment relating to forcing food on you, but then the food products are basically poor tasting fast food.  The french fries had a strange smell.  The burger had no taste.  Yet, they are charging MORE than Mez charged for good quality chef-quality food.  It's bad enough to look through a menu of frozen-fried junk food, but it's hard to mess up that level of foodstuff, and these clowns sure found a way.  $13 burgers just do not taste like hockey pucks in the real world.   I was so put off by the experience, that I may seriously just pretend there is no movie theater downtown.   For the most part, I am the type of person who understands growing pains for new businesses.  Certainly they might shape up the employees a bit, which is a glaring need.  But while they didn't change much, the changes they made cause the dinner-and-movie experience to be much worse than before.   Their whole business model is completely terrible, in my opinion.  Terrible food at high prices selected in the dark and ordered with whispers eaten uncomfortably on a poorly retrofitted tray and dealing have low end employees hovering around the theater the whole time.     I had very low expectations when I went, and it was far worse.   Maybe someone who hadn't been to Mez, and doesn't care about 'having nice things' will totally be fine with this, I don't know.  But for the same or higher prices, it is hard to imagine tolerating such a steep decline in quality and experience.",

I ordered one of the flatbread pizzas (which was just OK) but I would go back in a heartbeat with a friend to catch a movie and a bite and try other menu items. All of the other food that I saw others order looked very delicious. If you live near uptown, this is such an easy way to knock out dinner, drinks and a movie all in one fell swoop.

I pushed my button right away and the server took my order for a burger and a water.  My burger came in a decent time, but was given to my friend instead and she passed it down to me. My water only came after I pressed my call button an hour into the movie and the guy personally ran down and ran back up to get it.  I think they kept keying my stuff under another seat. My check was given to another seat and after I paid my credit card was given to the wrong seat as well.  We're talking the other side of the section wrong.

The main problem is the workers there. I believe they go on the streets and find sign holders to work there. All of them looked sloppy, they had no idea what was going on. It made us feel like we were at a bad section of town watching a movie, where we were supposed to be uptown having a nice elegant experience. Will not be going there again. We will try Cinnabar.",

I don't know why all theatres don't do this. $30.00 on popcorn and a small drink, or an app, entree, dessert, and or a drink?!! Can't beat that with a stick. Though I must say, I don't know how much a ticket cost for a movie lol. I've been to two events here (in the same week) and they were both free. Shame on me haha! The only set back for me is that there aren't any fish options on the menu. Lots of great choices, but not really something for everyone. I was surprised by how good the food actually was. The chef came into the theatre at both events that I attended and was very friendly. He wanted to ensure that everyone enjoyed their meal. Nice touch. I should have suggested that they offer a \"grilled\" entree option. It is \"Studio Movie Grill\" after all. Would grilled salmon be too smelly in the movie? I don't think so. There are plenty of people there to ensure that your movie/dining experience is stellar. Almost too many people. I thought that everyone running around the theatre during the movie delivering food and drinks would be a distraction. It's not lol. It's a great alternative to your regular movie experience.

I went for the first time here in the beginning of October. Wasn't crowded and was nice. I enjoyed it! Enjoyed so much that I bought my parents with me to see Halloween when it came out. So we ordered our meal and it came out 30 minutes before the movie ended. No exaggeration! Next, I went with my friend to see another movie. It took an hour for the food to come out and the fries were cold. Lastly, I went with another friend this pass Saturday. The first thing was said from staff is, they ran out of menus and to share with guest inside the theater. I was able to obtain a menu. Push the button to order and a staff member came and turned it off and stated to turn the light off and he'll be back. 15 minutes later he came to place our order. The movie had started. I like to come before movie starts to place orders so I won't have to miss parts of the movie. Placed my order and they were out of regular chicken tenders. So we ordered something else. We never received the popcorn with the 2-$28 meal and I advise them of that twice! The stated they were going to bring but never did. I didn't receive my water until I received my meal an hour later. The fries were cold again. The person beside us didn't receive their meal at all. I love to go to the movies all the time and wanted to try a new location. Go for the movie only if you go. Do not, I repeat DO NOT ORDER FOOD. This is not the place for meals! You will enjoy your movie only. I've spend $40-60 each trip and it's not worth it. The service SUCKS! Back to AMC and Regal I go.",

To start off the staff is not aware of the interruptions they cause. It takes forever for food to come and the food is not much better than fast food. The popcorn is often overdone and salty. The movie is so loud... to the point you can barely enjoy the movie. The foot traffic is high outside in the multi-use area but that is due to location which is expected but upscale should not be the defining term for this theater.  There are so many better options!",

And they said the carbonation machine was out. So we ordered pink lemonade. About 30 min into the movie, everyone's orders had come out except us. Finally I ring the button again and the girl comes out and says they don't have pink lemonade either. So I ask for popcorn. It's now an hour in and still nothing. Finally she comes back with a bill for our original order and asks if we'd still like it. I look at her like she's crazy. The only consolation was that they didn't make us try to pay for stuff we didn't get. Since when is it hard to get popcorn and a coke at a movie theater. It's not rocket science. Will never be going to this place again and you shouldn't either.",

Multiple times we have ordered simple things during the previews such as a milkshake and popcorn, once our order just never came and then the other times it would come out half way through the movie.

Twenty mins later (while we watch others getting served) we hit the service button again to get an update on our order. Told they would check. Moments later get a shake, no popcorn. We have now watched about the entire theater get served and into the movie. I finally get up and go find the manager to question how we still don't have popcorn.

    "text": "I went to the theater for July 4th/pre-bday gift. I bought my tickets week in advance. I went to main lobby counter to retrieve my tickets for 7:40 evening showing of my movie of choice, as read on tickets. My partner and I waited for a while, then shown our tickets to the ticket collector, which she read on them what movie, what time, and what theater printed on my tickets. She simply pointed to theater 3. We go into the theater and sit for about twenty minutes to learn we where guided to wrong movie. We go back to the ticket collector to inform we where sent to the wrong movie. She simply and knowingly says, \"Oh, yeah, I sent you to the wrong theater.\" She shared this information as if she was aware of the mix-up and didn't really care to correct herself. Suddenly, another random usher comes from no where. With an abrasive and calloused tone, he simply said corporate had changed the theaters for the 7:40 showing of the movie I bought a week in advance to 8pm and in a completely different theater. When I asked for a resolution, he says for me to go downstairs and call corporate. I understood the line backing up for the movie I bought in advance, but I felt the frontlines of staff weren't wanting to assist my wants. I then asked for management, and the young random male usher told me once more I needed to call corporate about my \"complaint.\" He said for my partner and I to go down to the front desk to get a refund and then come back to theaters to talk with management. At this point, I became stubborn, saying I wouldn't move from the line until I spoke with management about the tickets I paid for a week ago. He and the ticket collector kept saying for me to move to the side, but they didn't call for management until they realized I wasn't moving until I spoke with management rather than corporate. Eventually, the ticket collector and random usher contacted management. We spoke with Precious and Dee, the two managers on the theater at that time. Within about five minutes, they booked us for a later show that evening, saying we were \"management's guest\" for a later showing.  When we came back, the ushers took forever to get the theater ready. Also, the women's bathroom was \"out of order,\" and staff-to include the random usher from before-were being too bossy about when men could use their assigned restroom due to females were needing to utilize the men's. Then, when it was five minutes until movie, the random usher demanded all guests to go back to the lobby-whatever that was-to clear hall area for fire hazard issues. I respect that, but random usher guy was being too bossy rather than accommodating. Once seated in theater, the service for my drink took too long of a time. I understand the high demand, but I only ordered a drink, no food. It took half way through the movie and my partner requesting assistance TWICE to finally get my drink well over an hour after us ordering. The staff was just too disorganized when serving orders. I give my two stars for this review towards management: One for Precious, and the other for Dee. The staff is mostly very young, inexperienced youth. They had one of two values: Entitled or indifferent. The rumor of the millennial generation being without customer service skills is evident  with the current staff at this theater. They're slack and sloppy with performance. There's no organization. I don't see myself going there for a few years, giving the establishment some time to cycle new ushers and ticket collectors. Again, Precious and Dee, the management, were on point with resolving our issues. The hiring manager needs to be vigilante and firm with whom they're hiring.",

This time (tonight) they brought our food to the wrong people, took it back, brought it back out after 15 min., it was cold... I told them we didn't want it (no attitude) so the Manager comes and says its on him. That's great customer service! So why 3 stars???  Well... It would be different if this happened every once in a while but two times in a row. And this is the only two times I've been there. I like that the seats are comfortable. I like the tables. I like the screen, the atmosphere, the bar and all that outside, but the dining experience screwed it up for me. I'd rather concentrate on the movie rather than what I'm missing or what's wrong...   Bottom line: Get ya girl or female homie with the big purse to stuff all the goodies and snacks in it and enjoy the movie!",

But I came here for a matinee at lunchtime, waited 50 minutes into the film for my food and when it showed up it was cold and soggy.  Like actually cold.   So I sent it back, and sat through the whole movie starving and then got my crappy food 3/4 of the way through.  I ordered the catfish.  There were 3 tiny bits of fish each barely the size of a McNugget. The rest was all soggy fries and a few really greasy tiny hush puppies.    I thought I was treating myself for a relaxing way to have lunch, but in the end I had to eat in my hotel room afterward and just was angry the whole time.  Don't come to this place expecting to get any decent food service, or decent food.   The manager acted so surprised that I was angry about the situation.  I told him this is inexcusable and extremely poor service and he looked at me like I was the asshole with this look on his face like I just slapped his grandmother across the face.  I guess he expects people to smile and say, \"no problem\" when they're starving and being given terrible service.  He didnt do anything but send me back out my reheated food.  Didn't offer a discounted check or anything.  Terrible!!!!   I'm not convinced management in the southern states have the skills to deal with customers who are unhappy or disgusted by their bad service.  It's not the only place in Charlotte I was treated poorly for complaining about bad service.",

    "text": "SMG has frequently been a less-than-amazing experience but it is the closest theater to my neighborhood so, last night friends and I have it another chance. The experience was altogether disastrous. Upon entering, the bouncers were rude and offered us no direction whatsoever for claiming our pre-purchased tickets. We later discovered that they were setting up for an event that was taking place shortly after our movie started - which perhaps explains why they treated us an an inconvenience rather than customers. After standing in the wrong line for 10 minutes, we went to the self service area and the scanner for our bar code was broken. After finally getting our tickets to print, this is where the real let down begins. The food we ordered was sub par at best. The pretzel bites, pizza and chicken tinders all came out cold. We never saw our server again and we were certainly never checked on or offered refills. Each time another server would walk past, they would say things under their breath assuming that the sound of the movie would mask it-it did not. When our movie came to an end, we were informed by another bouncer that we could not return to the lower lobby to have our parking validated. After waiting behind the velvet rope for 25 minutes we finally were offered help by what seemed to be a manager. He took my parking ticket and the tickets of two other groups. As he walked off he told us we had to remain standing in the same order so that he could return the tickets to the correct party. When he finally returned, 10 minutes later, he offered no apology whatsoever and by this time, several event-goers had entered the exit doors while movie patrons left and were smoking in the hall beside us. He said nothing to them before we left. We will not be returning.",

    "text": "I would like to thank Groupon for the opportunity to try a new dining/movie experience and since we are new to Charlotte, we decided to try a half-off night out to see one of the Oscar raved movies.  First of all, if you purchase your tickets and use promo codes on the SMG website, be sure to note that you need to enter each code individually so you are only charged one $3 processing fee for the two tickets. Also, when you select your seats online, know that the top of the seating chart is actually the front of the theater stadium seating. (We selected seats at the top which were actually at the very front but we were early enough to switch to a higher row.)  There are a few things you may need to know as you decide to purchase your tickets. I am not sure if they had a really recent cleaning of some sorts, but when you walk into the front lobby, there is a tremendous overwhelming scent of vanilla/floral \"car tree\" smelling fragrance that is less than pleasant. I am very sensitive to scents and thought is was one of the front desk employees perfume.  As my husband and I walked up the escalator the scent continued and it even sorta smelled like it was masking possible stale smoke etc..Not completely sure.  Anyways, there is a bar area and you walk to a desk where you show your tickets. We were early so we could decide on the menu and start eating prior to the movie. Supposedly you should be able to be seated 40 mins prior to the movie but we had to wait until 20 mins and we were told someone would come and get us to take us to our seat? Also, it appears there are many employees around but maybe because they just opened at the end of February, but the employees seemed they were still in training.    Also, once we were finally seated, one of our drinks was mixed up and the \"food runner\" didn't know what they were bringing when I asked. I specifically asked if the pizza crust we paid $1 extra for was gluten free and they server said they didn't have gluten free crust when it was on the menu.  Also, we ordered a bowl of ice cream, but a plate with ice cream and a brownie came out with the plate messily covered with caramel. (Even on the bottom of the plate and sides and it got my table very messy.) When we asked what they were delivering the \"food runner\" shrugged and said he didn't know.  (Note: all of this commuication is happening during the movie which is difficult and is why we tried to get in early.)  All in all, the seats were semi-comfortable (not Cinepolis in San Diego :( and the food was decent (pizza burger ice cream etc..) For the price we paid, I guess we got what we paid for. I only hope they find a way to cut back on the air freshener scent and work with their employees on how to respond to customers and know what food they are bringing the guests. Oh, and when we received our bill they actually charged us for the brownie we didn't order and then resolved the bill.  It seems a few loose ends need to be tightened.",

That is nice but the trade-off is waitstaff interacting with folks throughout the theatre.    We had the margaritas and quesadillas and everything was great.  I was shocked at how fast the food came out.  The waiters use hand-held things that type the order in so they don't have to go back to a 'station' to type in the order.  All of that saves time and you get your food quickly!  Nothing else has really changed about the place that I noticed.  Possibly the prices are better - Monday they have half price tickets!!!  I didn't get to ask if they still validate parking but i hope so - that is a plus to seeing a movie here.  I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at SMG. The service was attentive, the venue is cool & hip, the chairs are comfy and the screens are big!   I thought the venue was awesome. I love how you can get your tickets and grab a drink and hangout before your movie starts-- or after your movie ends. This would be a GREAT place for date night.  Their comfy seats in the theater even have the arm rest that comes up in the middle of your two seats-- so it kind of make a little love seat.    The service also earns 4 stars. While the staff is still learning the ropes, you can tell they really want your night to be special.  They were nice, attentive and helpful. Every time I pressed the button for service, I was greeted within 2 minutes. I love that you don't have to get up during the movie for food or anything.   Their house margaritas were awesome - the right amount of sweet, tart and alcohol-- which seems to be hard for a lot of restaurants to master. I also noticed on the menu that a lot of 'skinny' beverages are offered which is really nice to see.     Now let's get down to business, the food! I really thought the food would be sub-par, but I am happy to admit I was wrong. My favorite dish of the night was probably their pizzas -- those were great.  Fresh ingredients, really good cheese and awesome thin crust. You could order that for your meal and leave not feeling disgusting.    The sweet potato fries were just as good as Bad Daddy's or Cowfish.  The burgers were also good with a good variety. I ordered the Gouda Bacon and was not disappointed. SMG didn't skimp on the Gouda and the onion, tomatoes and lettuce tasted super fresh.  I also have to put a spotlight on the coconut chicken tenders-- those were SO good.   To top of the night, I order a Frozen Hot Chocolate. I tried to eat only half, but that proved to be impossible.  Order this, you won't be disappointed.",

I don't think 5 minutes went by without a server walking up to a seat.  Beyond the distractions, the pizza we ordered was less than decent, it was barely cooked.   Going forward I will be grabbing dinner somewhere in Phillips place and seeing a movie there.",

    "text": "Uptown is back to having a movie theater once again.  While I was fear for my wallet, I was pleasantly surprised by the ticket prices.  $10 adult, $7.50 matinee /student.  Ladies night on Tuesdays for $5. Wow... I don't have to sell my organ to watch a movie?    Melissa and I went on a Monday to see the new Oz movie. 7pm showing. We ran into a slight problem when we were being led to our seats.  Something about the actual seat #s and the #s on the ticket don't match. I hope they fix it by now, because I was not too happy missing my previews while the usher/waiter trying to figure out where to put us.  Monday night came with half price margaritas special, frozen or on the rock.  It came in a big tall pint glass.  It was so much better than any icee or soda. I literally felt like a kid for a split second when the waiter put down my drink on my little table. I held it with both my hands (no spilling!) and took a good gulp of it.  Fabulous!  We ordered a chicken quesadilla to split. It came with a side so I picked chips and salsa. It's plenty to keep both of us happy. Melissa got to press the red button to call for service. While at first it was odd looking at waiters running around in the dark in front of the screen, I got used to it pretty easily.   Only complaint was the crying baby.  Obviously not the theater's fault, but seriously who bring a crying baby to a movie and stayed the entire time the baby was crying?  People are so inconsiderate.   Overall thumbs up. And oh I think they have special showings for $1 (ex. Magic Mike the other Wednesday).",

    "text": "This is truly dinner AND a movie... Movies in Uptown are back! Studio Movie Grill (SMG) is a great addition to Uptown.   For those of you who visited Mez, SMG has a similar set up. One of the changes is the addition of a swing out table at each seat.  Think of it as a cooler version of those classroom flip tables - only it's attached to a plush movie recliner rather than a hard plastic seat that's too small for your bottom. The reason for the swing out table?  Well, you get to eat at your seat... but don't worry about balancing a meal while trying to find a seat, you can order at your seat too. Each seat has a little red button that you press when you're ready to order. The food is pretty good too - definitely better than your standard nachos.  I had the sun-dried tomato and arugula pizza and my husband had the cheese quesadilla with fries.    The food came out pretty quickly and the servers were pretty attentive. One thing I did notice was that it's not pitch black when the movie is playing - I did appreciate this as I wanted to see what I was eating. But this may annoy some hard core movie lovers who want complete darkness and no outside distractions interrupting their movie.   But I enjoyed my first time there - we'll definitely be back!",

You can reserves  your two a seat even online. Now what makes this place more special than others? The fact that you can order food and they bring it to you quickly. I so would've ordered more but I already ate at the restaurant right next to it. But there menu is large, but mainly filling up with drinks. I ordered the frozen hot chocolate and that was delicccccoous! I want it again so badly. The one bad thing is that of course everything in the movie theaters are 300% overpriced. But nonetheless I had an exceptional time! I came in for my birthday and I was greatly pleased with the customer service, the movie, and the food!!",

We had to wait in line for the theatre to be ready for a loooong time and were allowed in right in time for the previews to start.  The pizza is the only menu item I find worth it's price and I didn't like that they turned off the pop machines halfway through our movie because it was 11:00 PM.  They should wait til all showings to turn down the machine.  (I understand the kitchen closing, though.)  I will definitely see a movie here again.  Especially on Tuesdays.

    "text": "I wish I could disagree with the folks who already reviewed this place, but I don't have too much to add. Ben G is right: Go for the movie (and drinks), not for food.  I actually like the new seating arrangement and appreciate that the service / food comes to me. I never liked ordering at the counter and having to fetch the food in the middle of the meal. You do in fact get used to servers scuttling around like cockroaches in the middle of the movie.  It sounds like they have the service part worked out for the most part or will soon (we had very quick response though a friend the next week didn't).  I thought that maybe they were working out the kinks in the kitchen, by the time we visited after the changeover but I think maybe they just have a bad menu / recipes. The burger was mega-burned. I understand the whole department of health must not serve undercooked beef if you don't grind onsite rule, but this lacked any moisture. Take a lesson from Five Guys or Burger Company, kids.  I did appreciate the brioche bun and toppings (we got the BBQ sauce one). I would not reorder without them changing the recipe and people gushing about it. The quesadilla was OK but unremarkable and very bland.  I didn't know what Lyndsay meant about thin chips, but they really are quite wimpy and unsatisfying. The strawberry (mango?) margarita was supposed to come frozen and it came on the rocks which was OK but it was the sweetest drink I've ever had, which was not so good.    Perhaps we try the coconut chicken tenders next time with our flick and stick with wine/beer.",

My daughter LOVED her food she had Buffalo chicken tenders and fries , I had an AWESOME Asian and Wonton Salad with Ginger dressing and my hubby had Quesadila's with sweet potato fries. Our movie was Awesome we say Oz in 2D wasn't sure what 2D was but basically we didn't need any glasses. The push for service button is right on time and the service was punctuale and very friendly as well. We will be back when we have out of town guest as we just relocated to Charlotte, NC from Chicago and would like to introuduce some people to Studio Movie Grill while they are in town visiting.  We also want to check out the lobby bar this summer as it wasn't open when we were exiting our matinee.",

    "text": "So to start out with, I'm like, incredibly lazy. I mean it's ridiculous. So the idea of a movie theater where I could sit there and press a button and have all my food and drink served to me was such an awesome concept I knew it would go really well with Jurassic Park 3D. PS: Those dinosaurs still look so awesome.   We get there and the front desk girl was really nice and when we got upstairs they gave us a menu and we went to our chairs. I noticed a couple of things here: The cup holder is awkwardly placed. I want it next to my face so I don't have to reach over in the darkness to put my cup away and hope to god I don't drop it. The tables weren't so great if you had to use the bathroom during the movie. Which I totally did so I experienced that level of awkwardness myself.   The food is okay, my friends salad was a weird combination of salads and my coconut chicken tenders were pretty solid. The service was so weird though. Like, I wasn't sure if all the people were brand new or what. They came to take our order a couple of times before they realized someone else had taken it. My coke refill took for freaking ever. Seriously. We got our check halfway through the movie so that was a genius moment on our part since everyone else had to hang out during the credits to pay.   So by all means go and enjoy, but enjoy it a little less than if you had just gone to a restaurant and a cheaper movie theater. You could probably even just sneak in some vodka and it would still be cheaper.  Oh and they validate parking but if theres a dude standing there asking you to fork over 10 dollars to park then they don't validate. I told him I would just parallel park and I parked for like 4 hours for free so if theres a lesson anywhere it's to parallel park people. The spaces here are ridiculous huge. It's not even that hard.",

    "text": "This place is quite new and so a lot of things could still use a lot of improvement. We first tried this place as part of a Yelp event. The Yelp team did a great job in organizing everything, but the rest of the experience was mediocre at best.   At the event they had a lot of menu options to try, which was good, since that way we could try a lot of things instead of having to eat a plateful of the same stuff. The blue margaritas and the Redd's Apple Ale were good. The appetizers were okay on an average but the bbq chicken pizza / flat bread was really good, as were the shrimp, crabcakes and quiche. The ribs and coconut chicken was worse than average (my boyfriend loved the taste of the coconut chicken though, but I just thought it was too dry). Overall the hors d'eouvres event went well, with the alcohol and the appetizers flowing. I didn't get a chance to try the Cupcake wine because I wanted to stay awake for the movie but after reading the other reviews, I kinda wish I did.  It all started going downhill after that though. During the movie I ordered a black bean burger for the entree (we just ordered one between me and my boyfriend since we filled up on the appetizers) which took forever to arrive. It didn't feel that bad since we were distracted by the movie, but it must have taken at least half an hour for the food to get to us. After that, I was dismayed at how it was served. It came in a bowl, along with the sides (fries) and a smaller bowl of ketchup. I've never been served a burger in a bowl before. Needless to say, when I picked up what I thought was the whole burger, all that I could pick up was the top bun and the patty, partly because of how high the burger was. And I'm terribly sorry to say this but it completely failed in taste, lacked flavor and was really dry. I wish we could have ordered something more (the smoked bacon and gouda burger?) to see if they did better overall and just the black bean burger was what was wrong. Also, the servers seemed really unsure of themselves, but I guess that's because the place is new and they are still on the learning curve.  My boyfriend also noticed that the speaker system was off. The surround sound was fine, but the main front speaker where most of the voices came from was way distorted and quiet (those are his words, unfortunately I don't notice such things).  We decided to give them a second try when my boyfriend's parents were in town. The servers are just as confused about the entire layout as I remember. Something that was ordered by someone sitting in row J or K was first brought up to us (all the way back in row M) and when we said we didn't order it, they finally found the seat that ordered it. And this wasn't a one time thing, they kept bringing orders to the wrong seats and/or asking people if they received their orders or were still waiting for it. As it is, it was a distraction to have the servers walk around the place, and on top of that I don't want them bothering me when I haven't even ordered anything and am just trying to watch the movie.  I really hope they get a little more organized system in place to serve people or at least have their servers familiarize themselves with the layout. I also suspect the whole taking orders on iPod touch isn't quite working as well as they hoped it would, but oh well, what do I know?  Oh by the way, when you get your ticket validated, make sure it has the extra validation bar codes. My boyfriend gave the parking ticket to the lady at the box office to get it validated and she probably ran it through the machine, but it didn't actually print the validation bar codes. We didn't realize it till we handed the ticket to the lady at the ticket booth while exiting the parking and she asked for $10 saying the ticket wasn't validated. Very careless move, SMG.",

    "text": "Do not waste your time or money at this theater.   My boyfriend and myself attended SMG on 11/19/16 for the 7:30pm showing of Almost Christmas.  We arrived to the theater around 7:00 because our ticket stated to arrive 20 mins prior to showing.  Once we got tickets scan to enter the theater we were informed that our theater was not ready yet.  We waited another 15 mins and I went to ask the front hostess was the theater ready yet or will they announce it over the intercom just in case I missed the call.  The hostess then proceeded to tell me that a call will not be made but she can get someone to yell it in the lobby for me because she was not going to do that.  I just smiled at her and went back to the lobby.    We finally are in the theater and placed our orders with no issue.  We ordered food, alcoholic beverages and water.  Our alcoholic beverages come out first with no straws, it takes us about 10 mins to flag down someone to get straws.  After about 30 mins into the movie our food order comes with no silverware or napkins and we still have not received the waters that we ordered.  Our server read the order back to us in the beginning and the waters were on there.  The food preparation was sub par but because of the wait we are just ready to eat.  At this point in the theater there are no waiters are walking around so it takes about 20 mins for someone to acknowledge our light.   The waiter comes and we tell her we need napkins and we never received our waters.  She lets us know that she has no control over waters, which I believe is an irrelevant statement if we are expressing our concerns to you.  She said she would check on it and brought us back some napkins.  Needless to say we never received our waters, my boyfriend had to go to the bar to get the waters himself, which is unacceptable if we asked for something and are being provided a service.  This by far was the worst experience I have had at SMG and after the service that we received we do not plan to return to.",

Unfortunately out of the dozens of times i have been here it has been more of a miss than a hit.  The food is actually good and reasonably priced, the problem is who knows if you'll get it cold, or the right food, or if you'll get it at all. Why have i been here so many times then?...the $5 movie ticket Groupon that had been up there for years of course.   So i went to smg with my husband with the full intentions of grabbing a full meal while enjoying a movie, like we've done plenty of times before. I arrived early because i knew the theater was packed and i wanted to order my food before the movie began. Unfortunately, the movie started at 8 and they didn't let anybody in the theater until 8. They said they were cleaning up from the previous movie which was a poor job because my tray table along with others beside me were still dirty. Still hoping for the best, we sit down and immediately hit our light. A theater with every seat taken and they decided to only have one server for the first 10 minutes!  Finally two more pop up and there is still hope to order our food before our(now delayed) movie begins.  So if they get a star for anything it's for $5 movie tickets and $5 select apps and drinks, all on Tuesday's. They also have other daily specials. Ordered things we had before, half order cheese fries, half order nachos and buffalo bites( because they ran out of tenders ) and two waters. Food came out quick, but you guessed it....cold!my husbands fries and nachos were decent so he kept it but my bites were way to cold. Hit the light and wait 15 minutes for somebody to come. I explained the problem and they put in another order for bites. We reminded them we have not received water and need silverware. 15 minutes later i get kind of hot chicken. We remind them of water and silverware. The server quickly brings us back 1 thing of silverware and runs away. Mind you it's two of us. I just decided to eat my saucy buffalo chicken with my hands. Movie ends and if you caught on you realized we never received our water. Spicy and dry food with no water was a wonderful movie experience. Sad part is them forgetting my drink is not a first. It has happened a couple times before. They charged me for both the cold and hot chicken bites so i had to find a server and got the manager to fix it.   So in conclusion, maybe just stick to watching a movie and eating before or after, this place will find a way to disappoint.",

Yes you went through a remodel to take out the comfy, rocking seats and fit in more seats into the theaters... and the seats are fine, but when your competition is staying at home and streaming media content, a movie theater experience should be a little more comfortable.  When I think about the new seats, I liken them to just a step above a leather office chair.  Seats aside, it feels like the service has gotten slower (maybe due to the increased number of people in the theater).  We ordered drinks and popcorn and it took maybe 20-25min to get drinks and the \"large\" popcorn came cold and the top of the bag rolled up as if it was someone's left-over popcorn getting ready to go home.  My friend and I also noticed that our feet were sticking to the floor on the way out of the theater (in the common space!).  It really doesn't take that much to make me happy, but the combination of cleanliness, slow service, and having servers constantly blocking my view made for a bad movie-going experience.  Unfortunately for me and my friend, we had seat at the top of the stairs, so an un-impeded view of the screen, but half the movie was trying to move and see around the servers due to the family that ordered a TON of food and drinks... for some reason they kept sending the food back or maybe they couldn't figure out who ordered what, but it was really annoying.  No, I did not want to hear, \"I ordered extra oranges with my Blue Moon\" being yelled at the server during the movie's quiet scene... kinda kills the entire progression of the story line.  Another thing I noticed was the soap dispensers in the guys bathroom were empty and instead, there were soap dispensers on the counter, which is fine, but I take it as an indication that there's been a change in how they do things here.  I want to note that the bathroom sink was covered in water.... yes it's a sink, but I would think the water should make it into the basin and not be all over the place (well hopefully it was mostly water).  The lady beside me also ordered a popcorn, and I gave her a warning that it took a while and it was only 3/4 full with the top rolled up.  Her popcorn never came, but she wasn't missing anything at all... and saved some $$.",

    "text": "Worst movie experience ever. Happened to have dinner in the EpicCentre and decided to hit a movie, so we ended up here. When we arrived I had a small takeout box with my dinner and was told I couldn't take it in. I was too far from where we parked so I had to throw my food away. I overlooked that bc most movie theaters don't allow food inside. When we bought our tickets no one told us where to go. I had to ask a random employee where our movie was. Once we were seated in our movie, we ordered two drinks. While we waited the movie started. I couldn't hear the movie bc people were loud, laughing talking etc. An usher nor an employee did anything about the noise level of the patrons. It was horrible. When the movie was almost over I got one of the drinks I ordered. I didn't even get the other drink, and on top of that was charged 38.00 for 2 drinks! Once the movie was over we asked for a manager who we never got to speak with. Some random girl took off one of the drinks off my bill and said it would be back on my account next week. This was literally the WORST movie experience I've had in my 38 years of living. Never in my life will I go to Studio Movie Grill again.",

We went on a Friday night ( opening weekend for Black Panther ) but we saw 50 Shades Freed.   The girl who takes our tickets snapped at me when we tried to go in saying we were way too early ( 25 mins early ) even though the website says to arrive 20 mins before your show. She was very rude in saying it wasn't ready yet.   We got to go in at 1010 and the movie starts at 1015 so then they delayed the start of the previews until 1035.   Then they were out of my first two choices of food and my sisters top two choices for food. They brought me my drink with a HUGE glob of mayo INSIDE the rim of the glass and no way possible to not see it. So I asked for another one. They brought my sisters drink ( same problem ) so we asked for new drinks and waited about 7 mins for drinks ( $4 for a sweet tea )   Our food was brought out cold and it wasn't good at all but I hadn't eaten in 12 hours so I ate it, but my sister didn't eat hers.   The staff was in the doorway during the movie and were talking, laughing, making fun of customer etc and it was really hard to hear or get into the movie.   This is by far the WORST theater I've ever been to. I really wanted to like it but just couldn't. Awful awful awful customer service and not worth the drive or the money. Nope. Just awful.",

    "text": "This place is a disgrace to movie theaters. The original theater \"Mez\" was great, but as soon as SMG acquired it, things went downhill fast.  We have been going to this location for years but it continues to disappoint time after time.  Every time I decide to give them another chance, it is a bad experience and I walk out with a bad taste in my mouth, LITERALLY!  When SMG acquired Mez they started out by replacing the comfortable sofa seats with these plastic airplane seats. They sacrificed comfort so they can cram as many cheap seats in there as possible. The floors are always sticky and it seems like cleanliness is a secondary priority.  One of the worst aspects of SMG has to be the service.  The staff are consistently slow and appear to have little training in customer service.  On many occasions, I wait 15 or more minutes for someone to arrive and take my order once I hit the call button.  It is pretty distracting when you are watching a movie and wondering where the food you ordered 45 minutes ago is. On one occasion my food never came out but you can bet that I was still charged for the invisible meal!  The drinks are no better. When you want to enjoy a nice cocktail with your movie you typically get a sugary mess made by an amateur bartender.  Oh, and that is after you waited 30 minutes for it to arrive.  No matter how bad the food and drinks are, they will never compensate you for a bad/wrong order.  All you will get is a half-hearted \"sorry about that\" and if you are lucky they will get you a new drink.  Many times they apologize for getting your order wrong and then proceed to do NOTHING! Honestly, the staff here are among the most poorly trained I have ever encountered.  Our most recent experience was the most disgusting.  I ordered a cocktail and I received more than I bargained for...there was a FLY (see photos)  drowning in my drink! That was the last straw for me.  How can something like that get past both the bartender and the waiter who served it to me? I noticed it as soon as they brought it out to me.  What did I get for this extra little surprise? An apology from a random waitress and she replaced my drink.  They did not compensate the drink on my bill, nor did they have the manager speak to me and apologize for what just happened.  If you watch \"Bar Rescue\" you will see that a fly in a drink is a cause to \"SHUT IT DOWN!\". I can just imagine how many of their liquor bottles have little creatures residing in them. Obviously, there is no quality control whatsoever.  In conclusion, this place flat out sucks.  You pay a premium price due to its location in Uptown while receiving amateur service, inedible food, and mediocre drinks with flies in them.  This is not only the worst theater that I have been to, but the worst restaurant that I have been to as well. Have a date and are thinking of going to SMG?....don't.  You can be sure that it would be the last time you saw that person again.  I wish I could give this place 0 of 5 stars.  It is that bad!",

We did not get any condiments with our order, asked for it and was told there would be a charge for ranch dressing, and we never even got it. Even though we asked again and were charged for it.

    "text": "Let's be clear: This is not my favorite theater in Charlotte. In fact, it's probably not even in my top three. But for what it is, I've had a handful of decent experiences.  First, understand that you're not going to see arthouse cinema or an up-and-coming foreign film at SMG. They only show the big box office blockbuster flicks.   Before you go, navigate yourself to Groupon and pick up a few tickets for $5 apiece. Depending on the time you go, it may not be a huge savings, though -- we went to the first showing on a Sunday, for example, and only saved around $1.50 a ticket. Better than nothing. And if you don't use your Groupon before it expires, you can still use it as a coupon for the amount you paid.  This is one of those theaters where the servers come to you before and during the movie. For this reason, I would recommend against any type of film where you need to pay close attention for fear of missing details, as there may be a fair amount of distractions if your fellow moviegoers are thirsty that night. Again, shouldn't be an issue, as I've yet to see a subtle, nuanced film playing here, but it's worth noting.  The food is fine. It's more utilitarian than inspired -- think burgers and pizza (both of which come gluten free, if you'd like). It's far from gourmet, but it's good enough and the portions are generous.  I would recommend sticking with early shows, regardless of the day of the week, as the Epicentre can be a real shitshow after dark.    On my last trip, we caught Jumanji at 11am on a Sunday and had burgers and fries. Our server was sweet and helpful, our meals arrived within the movie's first act, and theater distractions were at a minimum. This is how you do SMG.",

I really understand that it's a big load to have to feed and deliver all of the food to a whole theater, but they are either short staffed or don't have a great system going. Only one of us between the two of us (my husband and myself) were served water, and when we lit up our buttons to get more, the staff they forgot to bring it out. 10 minutes after lighting up our button for a second time, we finally get a refill on the one cup of water we had.   Both of us had cold French fries. My burger meat was rubbery and I don't even know if what I ate on it was actually guacamole or not because it didn't taste like anything.   The staff was polite, but definitely frantic and I just can't justify going to a place like that when I could get a much more satisfying dinner elsewhere before my movie.

It all seems to come out at different times and never all together. We ordered drinks, but got our food before our drinks. I had a cheese quesadilla with fries, but got chips instead and abt 5 mins later my fries came out. Still no drinks. I later had to press the button for my drinks. After that a random bowl of fries were brought out by the waiter. 20 mins later, the waiter comes out with one random water.

    "text": "Studio Movie Grille offers a lot more than your average movie theater. The fact that \"Grille\" is part of its name should have already tipped you off. Sure, you can come here and order popcorn and your average soft drinks. But who WOULDN'T be tempted by the decent list of adult beverages, full-fledged meals, and hot, made-to-order appetizers?   My husband and I caught a 6:30 pm movie over the weekend and showed up 20 minutes early to grab some dinner before our show. We couldn't have been more satisfied, and honestly pleasantly surprised at the quality and taste. Hubby got the California burger (complete with guacamole and chipotle mayo) and sweet potato fries. I went with the coconut chicken fingers and regular fries. Both were great options; both were clearly freshly made; both were served by a very friendly server. I was glad we came early because we were basically done with our food when the movie really got started; I'm personally not a fan of eating in the dark.   People complain about the servers interrupting their view of the movie and that the service is slow. If you're bothered by the occasional person walking below you or to the side (never directly in front of you, thanks to the strategically placed, comfortable stadium chairs), then my advice is simple: go to a regular movie theater, people. For everyone else who enjoys a tasty, unique movie snack and beverage, Studio Movie Grille is well worth the visit. (Bonus tip: Groupon typically has great deals.)",

Next, I ordered the Mac and cheese no bacon add steak. Understandably, they couldn't change the way the steak was cooked. Not so understandably, my food finally came out cold. I sent it back and ordered chicken tenders with barbecue and honey mustard. I asked for the sauces 3 times and still received only one of my choices. The honey mustard wasn't favorable. I had to wait another 10 minutes for them to bring my barbecue sauce. I asked for a refill on my water and never received it. Service and attentiveness was poor. Luckily the movie was good.

    "text": "First the good stuff: the chairs are insanely comfortable and roomy! I've never noticed issues with outside noise (never gone on a weekend though), bad picture quality or bad speakers. For you guys complaining about the price... Check groupon! They almost ALWAYS have $5 groupons. They also validate parking in the epicenter. Of course the food is a bit over-priced but it's nothing insane. The place always seems clean to me and smells like a vanilla explosion.   The bad: I'm not a picky eater at all...but I've had some pretty awful food here. The ranch is like water and once we got chips and salsa and I sincerely think they gave us straight tomato paste as salsa. We had a group of 3 guys and no one would eat it. I've tried the burgers twice and it tasted like a microwaved bubba burger. Now I stick with the coconut chicken tenders and they're edible. Nothing great and mostly breading but better. I've probably been here 15+ times and the food is usually lukewarm or even cold. Like I said, I'm not picky and understand it's a movie theater... But fried food that comes frozen should at least be warm... Doesn't get easier than that.   Alcohol: I'm not sure they use any? Never had a drink that tasted remotely alcoholic. Wednesday night is big beer night and last time they were sold out of 3 out of 4 options whenever they took our initial order. It was early on a weeknight... Didn't make sense. Then I went to order another and they were sold out of the last option and offered a 12 oz draft bud light as consolation at the same price... The big beers were double the size. Not sure how they thought that was a good deal.",

They did not design this well. The seats were comfy, but close together. The tray your supposed to have your food on is tiny and not well designed. Ugh I felt like I was on an airplane! The way you order was so crappy. I was expecting to be ordering with a tablet, not with a crappy button that my waitress had to pull her phone out in order to see my menu so that they could take my order!   They really should invest in tablet ordering so all the waiters have to do is bring you your food.   Seriously, this is 2015. Get with the technological times.",

But the ambience and bar experience was great. The place was not too packed and has a very laid back vibe. Not to mention, its beautiful inside.   We had two very attentive bartenders helping us...we simply said we want something sweet...and they both did an outstanding job....round...after round...after round....we were very pleased! I have no clue what any of the drinks were called but they were all delicious. And for that price, how could we not want to return?!?   I really look forward to coming back for the whole movie and dining experience! So definitely expect an update...soon!",

Came here on a weekend to catch the Great Gatsby, which was a pretty good movie. It brought back memories of high school and well, ya know, reading the Cliff Notes right before the quiz.  (Do they even have Cliff Notes these days or do high schoolers just \"wiki\" everything--I probably would!)  The best part is that I thought it was pretty good price at $13.50 a ticket or something and the seats were super comfortable--I fell asleep for a bit!    The food was not good.  Everything was cold except for the pizza that we ordered.  I'm guessing it was because the pizza that everything else got cold while they waited for it to bake.  It got baked, but the rest of our food was beyond lukewarm.    \"It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.\" - Nick Carraway.  Think on that for a minute, old sport.  I'll definitely come back here to watch movies--the seats are comfy-womfy.  dmo out.",

Most people won't even tell them that the screen is blurry. All they did was give us \"guest passes\" to another movie (the people who didn't mention the blurry screen didn't get anything). This guest pass cannot be used online so we will not be able to see a movie until it has been out for a few weeks (and is probably moved to the same crappy theater). Another friend of ours went to see Taken 3 over a week ago and had the same crappy screen. They won't fix it because people continue to spend money here.   When I say blurry I mean we couldn't see anyone's facial expressions throughout the movie. Some scenes were so dark you could literally not see anything. I wouldn't be surprised if the other smaller theaters have issues as well.",

The image seemed back washed and way too much white light drowned out the image.   Sound quality was O.K. It was a cool for a comedy movie ... And would perhaps be cool for dramas.  ...Anything other than Sci Fi, or any film where video quality is at the forefront of the presentation.  I would not go to see a new blockbuster movie like Transformers or Maleficent here. I would have issues with the presentation.   I enjoyed my night out at SMG, but purists be warned...

Luckily, Interstellar was also playing, so we relaxed for an hour with some drinks and an app while waiting for its start time! (Oh SMG turn the volume down in theater 4! It was unbearably loud and actually vibrated the room! I ended up putting in earplugs that I happened to have in my purse!)  We shared the duo dips/chips. We thought we were just getting spinach dip and salsa, but our order came out with those two plus queso. The queso and spinach dip were very good. The salsa was not flavorful, although it looked liked roasted tomato salsa. My husband thought it tasted like canned tomatoes.  Once we were seated in the theater,  we decided we'd just share an entree. The grilled mahi tacos were excellent, although messy! They need to bring silverware and extra napkins!  The blackened seasoning on the mahi was perfect (and I'm picky with blackened foods) and not too overpowering! It complimented the cabbage-mango slaw wonderfully! The fries weren't a fitting side to tacos, but were excellent as well!  Since it was a Sunday special, I ordered the SMG cab for only $5. Great wine for the money!!!",

During the movie I wanted to order some snacks , I pressed my button and waited , but nothing . I pressed a couple other times , still nothing . I was into my movie and didn't want to interrupt it by going to get someone or be the jerk flagging someone down . If buttons were down I'd like to know or if service had ended it would of been appreciated to get that info . Even if it's a late night movie , I expect certain standards to still be met . The actual movie was good,  picture and  sounded just fine . I just expected more from service and the facility . If there is a next time,  I hope the experience is better .",

    "text": "Went to see a movie with friends and was surprised to find out that it was indeed a dinner and a movie type deal, where dinner is served in the movie theater. I was kind of excited, it seemed like a cool idea- and went into it with a very open mind.   I wasn't particularly impressed.  Tickets were cheap, the food was not, but obviously they've got to pay for the TONS of staff somehow.  I got two adult beverages and an entree, including the tip and the movie ticket for just under 45 dollars.  This, I expected.    What I didn't expect was for the \"tray table thing\" to be wobbly and uneven, causing me to have to hold my drink for the duration of the movie to avoid it tipping over.  I also didn't expect the food to be bland and cold, however, I suppose that to accommodate a full theater of movies goers at approximately the same exact time, you have to have some items already prepared.  I got a margherita pizza, and it tasted fine... bland and cold but it's a movie theater... I wasn't expecting much.  Long island ice tea was very, very sweet- but fine.  It was huge, however I don't think there was much alcohol in it.    Checks come about halfway through.  If you plan to get to the movie late, I guess you better hope they have the menu online cause its impossible to read it in the dark theater.  Also, its not the place to see a movie where minute details are important, as you will lose some clarity when wait staff comes and goes during the film, you have to pay your check, etc.  Much louder than a usual movie though, I assume to accommodate the hustle of staff.  Cool experience, I'd go again, it would truly depend on the type of movie.  ON a side note, the location in the EpiCentre is AWESOME.  Cool view of the city, neat place to be on a Friday or Saturday with live music and other attractions.  Parking sucks, arrive early.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here for a Yelp Elite event so we were fortunate enough to try many different menu offerings as well as drinks.   My favorite food that we had sampled was the coconut chicken tenders (to die for!). They also had ribs which my husband really liked, cheesecake, and a spinach mushroom bacon pizza (yum!).   For dinner I had a grilled chicken sandwich which I added swiss cheese and bacon, with the salsa and tortilla chips. My husband had a cheeseburger with fries. The chicken was very good, but I didn't really care for the chips and salsa. I thought the chips were paper thin, and I like my chips to have more substance to them. My huband's fries were very good and so was his cheeseburger. I stole a good bit of his fries.   For dessert we had the chocolate chip cookies which are served warm. I think you get four or five to an order, most of which we boxed and ate later. They were excellent!   As for the service during the cocktail hour we had I thought it was very good. The servers are fun and were definitely part of the reason we had so much fun! During the movie however, it was a little strange. We sort of had a specific waiter, but other would stop by if our light was on to see what we needed. I think it threw off the serving process that we all ordered at once. I think during a regular movie, you order when you sit down initially so that would cut down on the confusion.   Overall, I enjoyed our experience. I think the highlight was definitely the food and drinks. If you haven't had Cupcake wine, try it! It's very good. If you've been to Mez and then go to SMG, the decor hasn't changed but the mood and the experience have really improved. Good job SMG! Keep it going!",

My fiance and I rarely visit uptown.  It's just not our scene.  However, we had a Sunday to ourselves and decided to day drink at the epicenter.  I desperately wanted to see Age of Adeline.  I have a girl crush on Blake Lively, but who doesn't?  The staff is friendly, we find our seats and push the button for service.  We decided to order the \"endless\" pizza special they have on Sundays... Maybe it's endless because there is not a beginning.   We sat there for 40 minutes without pizza.  So I finally pushed the button for service and asked where our pizza was.  Conveniently, It came out immediately, so I asked them to get started on the next one.  The pizza was simply awful.  But I ate it, because we were day drinking and needed something.  and I ate the next one, to make a point.  They steered clear of us after bringing us the second pizza, probably so they didn't have to bring us another pizza.    They did however slip the bill to us about halfway through the movie.  Well, I guess I am done ordering?  Do I really need to dig in my purse and miss some of the movie to get you payment so soon?  They grabbed our bill 4 times with no payment in it, because we were watching a movie... finally we submitted the payment because them pestering us for it was even more distracting.  There is only one way out guys... we are going to pay.  chill.    There are plenty of other theaters that do this better... a lot better.",

Our friend got the coconut tenders first, and just went ahead and started eating. His drink came around 10 minutes later. My husband got his food and his drink never came and he had to reorder his. It was just a Pepsi. I finished my meal and ordered a second drink over an hour before the movie ended, but it never came. They never even told me it would not be coming.

    "text": "I've frequented SMG more times than I can count in the years that I've lived in Charlotte, but my experience on October 26 truly exemplified how poorly ran this SMG is. All started well, until I gave my credit card to the staff who was collecting all checks towards the end of the movie. A male picked up the bill/card holder and 10 minutes later a female employee came back around passing out receipts and giving cards back, but mine was no where to be found. I waited until the movie ended, and went to speak with the manager. The first manager claimed that they had swiped and returned all cards, so I must still have it or it fell under the seats. Annoyed as I was, I emptied my entire purse and even went back to the seat that my friend I were sitting at, to double check even though I knew I gave it to one of her employees. By the time I came back, the general manager came, and I explained the situation. He immediately began to insensate that my friend and I were trying to dine and dash. After hearing his tone, I was completely appalled and frustrated, because I had never been accused of stealing. Furthermore, my friend and I were dressed up, I'm wearing a dress and heels, and it's a Friday night during prime time movie going hours. Do you seriously think I would dine and dash, risking my entire livelihood on a $40 check? Once I realized the angle he was taking it (contextually, I am a Black woman, my friend a Black man, and the GM was a white man), I asked for him to check the cameras and even to call the police because I refused to hand over another card to pay for our food. Find & swipe the card that was given to you!! He decided he wasn't going to do either, and his \"gift\" to me was paying for our night out, which is something I NEVER asked for. I just wanted my card to be found, so that I could pay for my food, and we could have a great evening post the theater. He never asked any of his employees who looked like the description I gave him, if they had been in the theater, to empty their pockets, or if they knew were my card was. However, he did blatantly tell me, that he didn't know for sure if I had ever given a card. SO WHY NOT REVIEW YOUR SECURITY CAMERAS?? Long story short, I left storming out, angry that I had been humiliated and treated less than, and still had to call Bank of America to report my card stolen. NEVER visit this location. Save your time and money!!",

    "text": "I got a groupon for this place, I'm having a hard time deciding where to start with my horror story.  First off- I walked into a line all the way to the door and only 1 person working the ticket booth. After waiting in like for 20 minutes I was told to use the kiosk off to the side and that it would still honor my groupon, I proceeded to get out of line and try that instead. Unfortunately the kiosk would not honor the groupon and I had to get back in a line that was backed up to the door for a second time. 40 minutes later I was in my seat and had already missed the beginning of the movie, even though I got to the theater 20 minutes early.  Here you'd think they probably can't mess anything else up, unfortunately they can. I turned on my order light and waited while one waiter turned off my light, said he'd be right back, took someone else's order and left. So I turned on my light back on, waited another 8 minutes and finally was able to order 2 sodas and popcorn. It took 23 minutes to get the sodas (at this point I was pissed and keeping time) and the popcorn still hadn't come. I turned my light on to mention it again in case they forgot- the waitress sighed and said she'd just clocked in and someone else should be getting it. So 45 minutes into the movie and after ordering, checks were already being passed out for people to pay and my popcorn was just getting to my seat. I then had to pay 25 dollars in parking because their employee threw away my parking pass and validation.  I spoke to the manager after the movie and she did not offer any help. Needless to say I won't be going back. And I strongly urge you to stay away. Rude employees, Bad management, Slow service, and over priced food and drinks. There's a reason this place always has a groupon.",

    "text": "Much of the food at SMG is finger food, which I appreciated given patrons eat in the dark.  If you're in the mood to share, the Feature Four sampler platter is the way to go-you get two chicken quesadilla wedges, four hunks of Tuscan bread, a few buffalo wings, and chips and salsa.  The Spicy Buffalo Drummettes were surprisingly good, with crisp skin, juicy meat, and medium heat.  It was nice eating the wings in the dark-for once, I didn't have to worry about having sauce all over my face.  The Tuscan Bread was my personal favorite--the garlic butter made the hand-pulled bread a bit greasy, but the gooey cheese and marinara dipping sauce made it impossible to resist.     The chicken quesadillas were standard fare, and I loved the fire-roasted flavor of the homemade salsa.  The sausage pizza was not impressive.  It had a peculiar sweet sauce that conflicted with the flavor of the sausage, and the whole pie was dripping with grease.  Next time I'll opt for the BBQ chicken pizza or the thin crust Sun Dried Tomato & Arugula Pizza, both of which I've heard positive things about.  I tried the Megaplex Burger, and while the meat itself had a nice chargrilled taste, the overall flavor of the burger was boring.  I'd recommend the Steak Sandwich instead - it has shaved beef, mozzarella, sauteed onions, peppers, and mushrooms on top of sourdough bread.  The sandwiches come with fries (very good!), sweet potato fries, or tortilla chips, or you can sub in salad or fruit for an additional charge.  Of all the food I've tried at SMG, my favorites are the desserts.  The Rocky Road Cookies and Ice Cream is a show stopper (no pun intended).  It comes with three warm cookies and a dollop of Ben & Jerry's Nougat ice cream.  In a close second are the Macadamia Cookies and Ice Cream, served warm with a scoop of Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia.  Warm cookies topped with cold ice cream is a hard combination to beat!  I posted a full review on the blog, but these are the highlights.",

    "text": "I LOVE this movie theater. I've been here quite a few times, including today, so obviously I don't think it's a bad place.   Immediately when you walk in, it smells amazingly fresh scented, not like stale popcorn and dirty carpet. The ambiance is VERY nice. It's swanky and modern. I like that you get to choose your seat at the time of purchase. The price of individual movie tickets isn't expensive at all. The regular price is $10 and student/senior/matinee price is $7.50.   Upstairs, they have a comfortable lounge & bar area. The seats in the theater, as many have already pointed out, are absolutely the best. Very big & plush, like sitting in a recliner at home. I've tried the BBQ pizza before, and it was okay. I've also had the fried chicken tenders with french fries, and that tasted good. i didn't like the nachos, though. However, it still tastes better than regular movie theater food. I do recommend trying out a local restaurant in the area instead, though.  The patrons were quiet during the movie, the picture was clear, and the sound was crisp. Like some have pointed out, the service during the movie is a bit distracting at first,  but it's not too bad. The service was great. They even offer mints as you exit at the end of the movie. They also validate for the Epicentre parking garage for up to four hours, so that saves money & time spent looking for parking on the crowded streets. Also, the bathrooms are very clean. I just wish that they had a larger selection of movies from which to choose.",

    "text": "I have been to this studio movie grill multiple times, and it's really a hit or a miss. But tonight my experience there was the worst I have ever experienced- to the point of I will probably never return. I arrived at 10:15 for a 10:30 movie, and they told us we couldn't be seated in the theater yet, so we waited in the lobby. At 10:35 an employee came out to let us know they had forgotten we were there and we could be seated in the theater now, but don't worry because the movie hadn't started yet. We were the only ones in the theater which I thought would be cool and we would get served quickly since they weren't busy!   We attempted to order the Tex mix trio- to which the employee told us that it no longer came with guacamole because of budget cuts they couldn't afford to buy it. So we asked if it was the same price still, and she said yes and they'll bring two sides of queso instead. We decided not to buy it because paying the same price to not get one of the sides (the one that makes the price so high because of avocados) was not worth it.   So we tried to order onion rings-- but they were out.  So we rooted to our third and final option: lodes potato skins.   Our party of three ordered one order of potato skins and two brownie sundaes. About 20 minutes after we ordered the potato skins came out. They were fantastic.  About 20 more minutes go by and still the sundaes didn't show up so I pushed my button to alert a server we needed them, we were going to ask if the sundaes were coming out soon-- however nobody came to theater to check on us. After about 15-20 minutes I got frustrated and eventually turned off the button.   An hour and a half into the movie they bring the check to us as if we had gotten all of our food. To which we told them we never received 2/3rds of our food and felt we shouldn't have to pay, the waitress caught the biggest attitude I have ever seen, and when she was speaking to my friend and I attempted to comment- she cut me off and exclaimed that she wasn't speaking to me so how dare I interrupt! How rude of someone who works in a customer service position...  At this point they not only didn't bring our food but we're ruining our experience because they were arguing with us and we were missing the movie.  I told them that they needed to come discuss this with us after the movie was over because we paid to see this movie and they were ruining the entire experience.  5 minutes later they attempted to bring us the brownie sundaes but seeing as there was only 15 minutes left of the movie we denied them. It DOES NOT take an hour and a half+ to scoop ice cream especially when we were the only ones in the theater.  We were not apologized to for our awful experience nor were we able to speak to a manager when we asked. When we left the theater there were no employees to be found.  This experience was completely awful and the company's service was so unacceptable!  This was my last night visiting with my mother in town and studio movie grill ruined the night for us. The LEAST and I mean LEAST they could do was apologize and refund the movie tickets since we missed a big chunk of the middle of the movie arguing with them.   Update: I received a phone call from the owner for manager of this location (I forget what he said his title was) who apologized personally and is working hard to correct the horrible situation that took place. I'll be changing my rating from 1 star to 2 for the time being, and will update again based on how my next visit there is.",

    "text": "Was here for a Yelp event and although they have a little tweaking to do I was really impressed. We were given samples of the food and drinks before our movie. The Blue margarita was really good to me, it tasted sorta like blue raspberry kool aid mixed with a touch of lemonade.  the pizza was really good, not sure which one it was (and i apologize for the blurry pictures on the menu but for some reason certain pages would not take a clear picture- but I took the pictures so you could see the prices). the pizza had ham and mushrooms and a few other toppings. and was so good! crust not to thick. very even throughout each bite with ratio to toppings and crust. bacon wrapped scallops, have a feeling they were previously frozen- but that does not bother me since Charlotte is not a coastal city it would be expensive to get fresh each day. Any-who they were delicious coconut chicken- i was shocked how good this was since I ate it before I knew what it was- I am NOT a fan of coconut at all.  Theater is large and with an amazing screen. Very modern with large comfy seats that have arm rest, cup holder, table and the seats lean back a little and they ROCK. you feel like you are sitting in a large recliner. you also have a service button in case you need to call your server.   now for the hard part of this review. I understand they are new and still in training of how to do things but this is where the 1 star fell off. it took a long time for them to come take the order and the movie had started. She took our entree, drink and dessert order all at once. And this happened to lots of others as well. This is a kink that needs fixing. Others received their food way before us and it was someone different who brought the food and brought all of it at the same time. NOW all you have is this small college type table (you know the little table in a college classroom) so I had to send the dessert back since I had no place to put it.  shortly after our food came our bill- Why? what if we were going to order additional items? this made no sense, and actually i did have to order my wine later.  They never came back to refill my water or check if everything was correct. Another kink.  the food though was again super! I had the ribs with fries and added a side of cheese (the cheese I received was something like Velveeta melted down with red peppers and green Chile peppers at a pot luck dinner appetizer) it was good but hard to manage. The ribs were tender and smoky, lightly sauced with a sweet/smoky sauce. They send you 6 individual ribs with a Good bit of meat on them. The fries came out hot and crispy, these are the seasoned shoestring type fries.  The dessert was huge- as you can tell by the picture- and definitely made for sharing. the chocolate frosting is VERY rich. So if you are a chocolate lover this is for YOU. At the end there was a lot of confusion with the servers and checks. Some servers were still bringing out desserts after people had left. Some waiting on there checks etc.  The servers were doing their best- but just were not equipped to handle such a large group. A few suggestions is to take orders before the movie, have servers that are assigned to certain areas so that there is less communication errors. once food is served have the server come back to inquire if drinks need refilling or if the entree is as requested. Again come back to remove any dishes and ask for dessert/drink order then. Once dessert is served present the check at the same time and then return a little later to remove dishes and check.  Other than the few kinks in service that need tweaking this was a great night. I love the concept and hope to return soon",

I understand since this is a sit-down dinner experience that they bring out all the food to you. BUT I really think they should have an area for traditional stuff that people can get themselves. All I wanted was movie theatre popcorn. I ordered said popcorn 10 miniutes before the movie even started. Simple right? It doesn't need to be cooked and should be the first thing people bring out. IT TOOK AN HOUR AND 13 MINUTES FOR THEM TO BRING ME POPCORN!!!! After I waited and saw tray after tray of cooked food brought out I was flabbergasted and confused as to what could be the hold-up. I rang my guy back in case he forgot or they didn't have it entered or something and he rudely said that he was busy and hadn't gotten a chance to get it. When it finally came out half way through the movie cold and without butter, he just plopped it down on the table with no apology or anything to explain. Based off all the other reviews of this place I now realize that I am not the only one. Bad business practices yall. I will make sure to avoid this theatre from now on.",

The ticket prices are very reasonable, and the seats are huge and comfortable.  Dining Experience: I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was!  For a movie theater, the food will most likely exceed expectations.  The Thai Chicken Pizza is great.  I also really liked the Coconut Chicken Tenders w/ fries.  The prices are a little high in my opinion, but not out of hand. (i.e. food at a Bobcats or Panthers game)   The main problem with SMG is the service.  This may improve with time, as the business is new, but the servers I have dealt with (for the most part) seem slightly 'out of sort'.  They have struggled to take orders accurately, and reflect the orders accurately on the check.  You may have to get used to the servers taking orders during the movie, but it is not that bad, as the movie is loud enough and they are fairly discrete (I cannot guarantee the same level of subtleness from other customers, though.)  Overall: I like SMG (mainly for the movie experience), and I will go back, I am just hoping for it to become a little better in terms of its food service operations.  Hopefully I can update this with another star in the future.",

    "text": "I am not sure what changed but the experience I had this week at SMG left a lot to be desired.   The two major highlights of choosing this theater were that they sell $5 tickets on Tuesdays and will still validate parking in the Epicentre garage. Cheap ticket (and my favorite - reserved seating) to see a movie and free parking are still something to make SMG worth investigating.   However my experience with the theater itself was lackluster. We met our friends by the bar and I went up to order the theme drink advertised on line only to find it not on the menu. When the bartender asked me what I would have I felt sheepish asking for \"the last rose petal\" but thankfully he knew what I meant. The bar was super sticky but the bartender was friendly and efficient.  When we went to our seats, a few minutes before show time, I noticed sticky floors. Our menus were so sticky we had trouble opening them.  Are you sensing a theme? There was definitely a theme.   Their 2 for $25 special that was listed online was missing from this menu. The waitress didn't come around to get our order until after the movie started despite the usual long line of previews. I ordered a popcorn and a glass of wine and settled into the movie.  After 30 minutes my friend's food and my wine came out but no popcorn for me. Service was unorganized with people's food and drinks coming out separate so I waited another 15 minutes to ask about my popcorn. The waitress was nice enough to follow up on it right away and I received my popcorn 1 hour into the movie. Which is a pretty ridiculous wait time for buttered popcorn.  Maybe it is because we sat in the back row this time but I found the servers much more distracting than I remembered previously. They were up and down the stairs with their electronic devices and flashlights consistently through the first half of the movie and then again at the end to settle up checks. Most of the workers were trying to minimize the light but I still found it distracting.   All said, would I return? For $5 movie nights sure. I just have no inclination to choose this theater in particular.",

Staff is always discreet when taking orders/serving and I barely notice them during a movie. My 1st gripe is the restroom. Recently, I went to the first showing of the day and no soap in dispensers. I try to get some toilet paper and the whole dispenser falls from the wall onto floor. Whoever stocked it had to know it was loose. During  the show I ordered pretzel bites, which came pretty promptly and quickly did I find out why: STALE. The queso had already started to congeal. Another time I visited, I ordered chicken tenders and fries. The tenders were so skinny I thought they were also fries until I shined a little light on them. I love the concept of this place, but sometimes it's the little things that matter... Like handsoap...and fresh food...and secure TP dispensers.",

The staff are very comfortable and this could be the destruction of customer service. The place was clean. The food and bar are a plus. The food taste decent, but the bar is nicer. Came all the way downtown to go to the movies because they had a Groupon special. If you're seeing a movie at the epicenter you get free parking. It's a nice spot to go somewhere afterwords or before because it's all in one developmental unit with other stores. Enjoy.",

    "text": "I really wanted to enjoy my visit to Studio Movie Grill. But this by far was a horrible experience. Upon our arrival for  a 2:30pm viewing of Captain Marvel we got inside the establishment at around 2:10-2:15. We were notified that our theatre was not available as of yet because it wasn't cleaned. No biggie, at this point. We check in and start viewing the menu. We sit down and press the button for a server to take our order. At first our server didn't seem pleasant but she eventually warmed up. Again not another biggie. The problem began to arise when 40 minutes to an hour into the movie our food nor drinks hadn't arrived. For a mother that's expecting and with an 8 year old child clearly that's a no go on the food. My husband then left the movie to speak with someone to see what the issue was. Come to find out our server never entered our order! The manager did try to rectify the situation by placing a rush order on the food and drinks, which I was grateful for. But that left us with less than an hour to eat everything that we had ordered. Not to mention my quesadilla was cold when I received it. For a dinner and movie that was nearly $60 this was unacceptable. Needless to say me and my family will not be returning to this theatre. It's not worth the money. The only good thing about my visit was the actual movie!",

    "text": "Arguably the worst movie experience I have ever had. Went to a movie here stupidly expecting decent food, service and a good night. Ordered our food when we sat down - about 25 mins before the movie \"start\" time. We ordered: small popcorn, iced tea, milkshake and pretzel bites. 45 minutes into the movie and we didn't have our food. We asked why (people around us ordered pizzas, chicken, burgers etc. after us and received their food in a timely manner). We were told the popcorn was \"cooking\" and they assumed we wanted it all to arrive together. 15 mins later, the milkshake and pretzel bites arrive. The pretzel bites are hard and the cheese is cold. The milkshake was half melted. 30 mins later and the popcorn and tea still had not come. The movie is almost over at this point. Our waitress asks if we need anything, and finally 10 minutes later, the popcorn and tea come. We are given a bill that has 3 beers on it as well. By the time the movie ends, no one has come to collect our bill so we have to wait in a line of people outside the theater to pay. Very very disorganized, and the staff is not helpful or friendly. Add to this the fact that we stood in front of the woman checking tickets for 2-3 minutes (with no one else around) before she even looked up at us, wait staff was loud and would block the view of the movie, and the fact that children were yelling and talking the entire time... it is safe to say that I won't be back here. There are so many other theaters in Charlotte with excellent food options and full bars... there is no reason to ever recommend anyone go here. I would pay double the price elsewhere for a much more peaceful experience.",

Food is now grossly overpriced and awful. \"Make your own pizza\" is $11. But if you want anything on it (pepperoni, onions, etc,) its a $2 charge EACH. Remembering that their pizza is \"homemade,\" I figured it'd be worth it. So wrong. It ended up being a worse version of a DiGorno's pizza.  My boyfriend used to loooove the sriracha chicken sliders. Lately, they've just been making them with some regular hot sauce on them, nothing special and NOT worth $14. They're overpriced for worse food. Save your money and go elsewhere.",

The service was off to a good start when our initial server was very friendly, took our soda and popcorn order and advised us to press the service button if we needed anything during the movie . We got our soda within 5 minutes of ordering , so I thought hey maybe all those bad reviews are unwarranted. 1 hour later and half way through our movie , no popcorn. We paged for service and she apologized and brought us our popcorn. It's either poor training , communication , or a broken system between ordering and delivering   Next , we paged for service a little bit later for a refill on our soda, and she had the audacity to say \" I need to close out all the tabs right now I can't get you a refill\" THE HELL. So finish your tabs and bring back the refill. I paged for another service since she was extremely rude and I saw other patrons getting refills without any issue. The second service member came by for a refill.   I'd highly recommend better training or a revamp of your SOP. This was terrible service and I'd never go back to order anything. Movie is fine sure ,but don't expect to get any good service , food or anything in a timely manner. It's all very sporadic and random based on your luck and who's serving you.",

I would like to note that while getting our ticket validated, the  girl at the front desk stepped away for a moment to tell a pack of teenagers that they couldn't bring in their backpacks. I really appreciated that because of all the unfortunate events that have been taking place lately and it shows that they care about the safety of the patrons. The theater that we were in was clean for the most part except for the sticky floor. The temperature of the theater wasn't too uncomfortable for me but we did notice that the AC came on an hour into the film.The server who took our order was friendly but there were other employees who needed a lesson in customer service. I was pleased with how long it took for us to receive our food. My brother and I both had chicken tenders.

The employees do not communicate anything with you. We placed 3 food orders and 3 drinks. We waited for a while and never got drinks.  Then when our food arrived we asked about our drinks and the person said oh they are coming right now. Ok so then it turns out that our food came out cold. After waiting for a long time again we pressed the button for service. We asked about our drinks and then she asked what we ordered and when we told her the response we got was \"oh that's because we are out\",  Really! So no one could tell us that. So we asked for other drinks and that was taking forever as well. So we asked to speak to a manager. When I explained it all she understood and apologized and put our meal orders again and assured me they would not be cold and would get our drinks right away. The drinks came out right away and the food did not take long and was not cold. So we were able to enjoy the rest of the movie thanks to her. After all her efforts we ended up leaving annoyed. We pressed the service button to get a refill and when we asked the girl for a refill. She gave us a look like are you serious. And she was like so you want a refill with a disgusted facial expression.  And we said yes. She said ok and walked away. We saw her wall to the other side of the theater and take more orders. We never got the refill. This place does not need to have people working like her. If you don't like your job and serving people then you are in the wrong position. I looked at her name tag and I think her name was Kortni. She needs to have better customer service skills. After the movie I asked to speak to Precious so that I could thank her for what she did and for making our experience better. But to also let her know about Kortni. It was taking a while for her to come and I get she was busy so we left and i decided to post this.",

On top of all of this the AC wasn't working they claimed the whole building had no AC which sounded like a lie to me because I heard this before when I worked there and there a Golds Gym in the Epicenter as well so I HIGHLY doubt that it was True. So we sat in a 3 hour long movie with no AC at 9:30 in the morning. Finally got parking validated .  They were offering to give refunds but I couldn't stand to wait another minute in the heat.",

Theaters and bathrooms are consistently dirty. Wait staff is untrained (ours didn't even know what drinks were on the menu) or just flat out disrespectful.

For starters I ordered from the two for $25 menu and selected a healthy option, the blackened chicken salad and my son ordered a pizza and sweet tea; well my salad came about 35 minutes after I put in my order but it was too salty to eat and my son got a unsweetened ice tea! I informed them of the salty salad and with an attitude the server said \"we'll do you want something else?\" I asked for a Caesar salad and it was terrible! I asked for water when they first took my order and even though I asked 4 different servers for my water and my sons sweet tea, it was not brought to me until I went out and found the manager and informed her of the salty salad that left my mouth dry as a desert! The water finally came about 20 minutes before the end of the show along with my sons sweet tea; but the bill came right after the water with both the sweetened and unsweetened teas and a suggested tip! Well maybe the servers at studio movie Grill need to understand the acronym TIP stands for \"To Insure Proper Service!\"   On my way out I stopped at the bathroom and boy was that a mistake! The bathroom was disgusting! Tissue all over the floor, lights out in some of the stalls, no hand soap, water all over the counter and garbage that was overflowing!  The manager is really trying to do her best, but the servers need to work on their serving and people skills!   The only good thing was the validation for the free parking!",

Too many servers scurrying around the theater, often chatting during the movie, seem to make little effort to be subtle or quiet. The food delivery is slow and our party experienced problems with our order which took an even longer time to correct. Furthermore, an issue with the parking validation became an expensive hassle. Assigned seating is one of the few perks, however given the rest of the experience I would be willing to forego assigned seats for a less distracting and more enjoyable movie going event.",

What's the point in getting a Groupon if u still pay regular price. Management was unprofessional and staff was very rude and have no customer skills at all. Place has always been going down hill and rarely ever gets full. Wonder why?",

Management seems to be on their game, but overwhelmed by staff that would give the zombies on walking dead a run for their money. Don't get me wrong, i have visited before and there are a few gems, but mostly dirt. This would probably be a one star, but Star Wars premier+Halon system going off in the kitchen=a nightmare night for any business. Staff \"could\" have made this a stellar evening, but dropped the ball.",

    "text": "This was my first experience since the change to SMG from EpicCentre.  Lets say I absolutely love this place!  I purchased coupons from Groupon and when i went to the counter to get my tickets the front desk was amazing. Very helpful. I love the fact that you now have assigned seating so no more looking for an empty seat. Those days are history. When you walk in the theater there are employees to direct you to your seat. LOVE IT!  We chose the \"love seats\" which have an arm rest in the middle but you can lift it to get the True \" at home cuddle\" that you want with your spouse while looking at the movie if you choose too. :) Attached to your chair is a tray that is easily moved should you need to leave your seat. It has an attached red button that you push to your waiter to your table. It is awesome. No filling out forms or having to get there early to take your food to your table. When the staff comes to your table they are very discreet and sit down on the steps beside you and whisper your order back to you once you've told them.  The food was absolutely fantastic! I have the appetizer sampler. I believe it was cheesebread with some lovely spices, buffalo wings, chicken quasadilla and nachos with salsa. Lovely displayed alone with dipping sauces in glass dishes!! ( i personally love that) The prices were not expensive at all compared to the normal prices of just popcorn and a drink. We had a milkshake, 2 margarita with extra Patron shot, the sampler of 4 for only $32.00 Bucks!!!  The theater is really dark so you don't really see the bodies moving around delivering food during the movie.  I have only one complaint, during the climax of the movie my waitress came to settle the bill, but with the LOOK i gave the immediately walked away. After the movie she did apologize and I left her an AWESOME tip :)  So please go enjoy!  I bet you will love it!  Billie",

    "text": "I've come here a few times and finally decided to write a review.  As a movie theater, I think it deserves 4 stars. The seats are super comfy, especially if you're on a date. The screen is pretty big, and just the whole concept is pretty neat.  As far as the food...   It's okay food - reasonable, especially for a movie theater. Theres quite a few options to choose from which is nice. They also have daily specials during the week.  The drinks.... EVERYTIME I have ordered a mixed drink there, it's pretty weaksauce. So most of the time I just stick with beer cause I know exactly what I'm getting.  One time I got a margartia pitcher...total waste of money. was soooo weak and 60% Ice.  NOW THE SERVICE Is why I have to give this place a worse score than what I want to. Everytime I have been here, the service is terrible. I understand it's hard to service a movie theater, but that's not the problem. Theres been multiple times where I order food and something that I order never shows up. One time I ordered a beer...waited 45 minutes and finally pressed my service button to tell them I hadn't gotten it...he apologized and got me one...but then when I got my check they charged me for two. Yes, I wouldve had two if my first one didn't take an hour to get.",

    "text": "Good food and service! A good date night spot.. Having said that, what you should also know is that if you prefer to watch a movie completely uninterrupted, this may not be where you want to watch it. You will notice the servers moving around, taking people's orders, bringing out the food & check etc. They try to be as invisible as possible - wearing black, and speaking softly, but we're so accustomed to not seeing figures move around in a dark movie theater, that it can be somewhat distracting.  The food was good - the appetizers especially. I ordered a salad (kale and avocado) for my main course, which I didn't love, and also, it wasn't the ideal dish to eat in a dark theater.. I wish I'd have realized that when I ordered it, then I wouldn't have eaten half of my husband's burger, which was quite tasty =). In my opinion, dishes like their delicious coconut chicken tenders or pizzas, are far better choices for that setting. While the theater itself is definitely more suitable for a date, (thanks to the ambiance and seat arrangements), the bar is a fun place for bigger groups. So, if you're trying to encompass everything from dinner to drinks to a movie, all in one evening, in one place.. this is a great one stop shop!",

    "text": "I purchased the Groupon for Studio Movie Grill and went to see a movie last night. Walking in, the place looked great. The lighting was nice, the woman behind the counter was nice, and overall a good feeling when I walked in. During the movie, my friend and I ordered a drink and some fries to split. I gave the waiter my card to pay for the order and realized that he never returned it to me just as the movie was ending. I immediately went to the front desk to go look for him because I had a bad feeling about this. As I was walking towards the front, he handed me the black folder thing with a receipt, when I get back to my seat, I see HE GAVE ME THE WRONG CARD. I understand people make mistakes, but it's a dark movie theater.  So naturally I assume that whoever card I have, has my card in return. I run down to the the desk as the movie was ending and the manager, tells me not to worry as people are piling out of the movie. I start to panic because I have no idea what they did with my credit card. More people start to come out claiming that they didn't have their card either. It was a complete disaster...The way in which this situation was handled was terrible. Finally after about 15 minutes of frantic, one of the workers finds a bunch of of receipts with cards piled in a lower drawer...I freaked out because I saw my card and the manager grabbed it from me claiming he needed to check to make sure that the \"right amount\" was charged..I grabbed it back and no way, I just wanted my credit card back.   Needless to say, the organization and carelessness was unacceptable. I am beyond disappointed that the staff is not trained enough to have the ability to keep customer's credit cards in order.   Overall, if you must go here, which I highly recommend you do not, pay in cash!",

Not a great first impression when it took us almost 15 minutes to get our tickets when we walked in....even though there were just about 8 people in front of us.  They only had one person working the register, and you have to pick out your specific seats when you check in - so I guess that slows the process.  They really should have called for back up.  We were bummed to miss some of the previews and be rushed getting in.  The theater itself is nice and the chairs are very comfortable.  Our server was very nice and attentive.   Most of our food was not very good.  It tasted like bad bar food.  I would skip the chicken tenders next time.  And the fries tasted like something out of a frozen bag at the grocery store - that had freezer burn.  I do have to give them props for my frozen hot chocolate. That was pretty delicious.  I just wish they would have given me a spoon to help me eat it.    Another suggestion would be to have them post some signs in the parking deck by the elevators telling movie theater patrons to bring up their parking ticket to the theater for validation.  We had to go all the way back down to our car to get that to save us the $10.  Sort of a pain.",

When it was ready, the previews were already running while everyone entered. No staff could be found for 20+ minutes. Nobody took our order until the movie was 15-20 minutes in. Our food and drinks didn't arrive until more than an hour into the movie, and they forgot my nachos (the waitress told me after the movie that they ran out of chips but decided not to come by during and see if maybe I wanted something g else) and also charged for the nachos. All in all, over a $100 for 4 people to watch a movie and have cold gross food in a poorly run, not even clean theater. No wonder they're not busy even WITH a $5 Groupon. Close already and let something else take your place.",

    "text": "I'm so torn with this place. Between Cinebarre (the other movie/dinner business in Charlotte) and SMG, I prefer SMG mainly because the sound was a LOT better (nothing is worse than trying to hear the movie over someone chewing). Also the seats are so comfy and I actually like having a button to press for the server to come up.   However, both times I've gone now, it's taken the server a ridiculous amount of time to respond to the button. So honestly, I don't really see it as much of a convenience as I would've liked.  The really bad thing is that both times I've gone, I've gotten pretty shoddy service. The servers are SUPER nice but I don't know if it's them or the kitchen but somewhere between me ordering and it getting to me, something goes wrong.  The first time I got my food wrong but it took forever to get a server so I just ate it and made sure my tab was done right.   The second time, our waitress read our order back to us THREE times (and that was at her suggestion, not ours.) Well, first, our food came super quick, but WELL before our drinks. I was halfway through my pizza before I had to stop eating and wait for something to drink. After about 10 minutes, we finally got our drinks. And they were wrong. But we were so thirsty and that had taken so long we just drank them anyway.  Luckily these mistakes weren't terrible. I mean, the wrong food and the wrong drinks were still tasty. But...it's not what I ordered. And it was too difficult to get them justified.  Also, when they bring the check at the climax of each movie, that's a little more than distracting. I wouldn't mind sitting a little longer at the end in order to pay than have a movie possibly ruined.  Overall, I think if they get all their serving/kitchen/bar kinks worked out, it'd be a preferable place for movies and dinner.",

Makes you want to dress up for the movies! + Beautiful lounge area to sip on cocktails while you wait for your movie + Gorgeous screening rooms + Large, comfy, couch-like seats with swing-out dining table + HD bright giant screen + Magical red button table service  Kinks that need improvement: - Popcorn.  Come now.  Fancy food is great, but please don't forget the quality in our old movie standard. - Checking out at the end of the movie became a bit of a circus. - The food.  It was hit or miss.  All the dishes were plated beautifully gourmet, but was a little short on flavor.  However, keeping in mind that this is a MOVIE THEATER, I hold no real complaints.  Just anticipation for what they do next.  Overall, four stars for filling a void in Uptown, and doing it with style.  It truly is the perfect date night spot.  Dinner and a movie and then off to dancing at the clubs next door.    It was a wonderful experience and I can see potential for greatness as this venue finds it's roots.",

The food and drinks were average but you're eating finger food and drinking margaritas while watching a movie on a big screen. There's a button you push to get a server's attention during the movie. I gots no complaints. The only way this set up could be better for me is if someone could pee for me in the middle of the movie so that I don't have to. Okay fine, the food could be better and the drinks could be too but they're not charging exorbitant prices nor are they marketing an amazing dining experience.  I liked the seating set up as well. There are \"couple\" seats with little tables that swing out in front of you and in the front, there are rows of seats. They do have daily specials like ladies night, half off margaritas, etc. I wouldn't go here for all my movie theater needs but it's worth going just to do something different every once in a while.  I think if I went on a super busy night, I could get annoyed at people being disruptive. But hey, who doesn't get annoyed at people. :O",

    "text": "Me, the boyfriend and our double date(s?) went to check out the Great and Powerful Oz last night... He's an okay guy... The theater was pretty cool, too... The staff was very pleasant and helpful, which is already a huge plus for me...  First, if you went to Mez, you'll be overall familiar with the layout... The lounge area looks virtually the same... I remember the chandeliers and various light fixtures, the ultra modern swanky furniture and the glowy disco elevator ride up from the ticket counter... I still like the look of this place... The drinks we all had were decent... I had the New Orleans Hurricane, our friends had the Raspberry Mojito and Longer Island Iced Tea (thumbs up to both, according to them) and the boyfriend had a Nutter Butter Frozen situation...  Yep, you heard me... Nutter Butter... It was kind of like a mudslide, but completely smooth peanut buttery goodness topped off with an actual Nutter Butter cookie and whipped cream... With alcohol... Ridiculously, fantastically awesome... My 'Cane was rummy in my tummy... That was so corny that I had to leave it in there after it popped in my head... lol  It was very tasty, though... Truly...   The button was nice... Instead of having to carry your food and drinks in with you or going back outside while missing the movie when your buzzer goes off, now you can just press a magic button and things will find their way to you!  The food that we ordered was top notch... I had the BBQ chicken pizza... It came out piping hot and piled with toppings... The crust was well-baked, the sauce was savory and the veggies were crisp... One of the best BBQ chicken pizzas I've had, actually... A+... The Thai chicken pizza was flavorful... Honestly, I was going to order this initially but I was a little worried about the quality of the peanut sauce they use... I shouldn't have been... It was the perfect balance of nutty and spicy... Let me tell you, I don't even like coconut, so believe me when I tell you: The coconut chicken tenders were out of this world!  They were so crunchy and juicy... I was really impressed... Lastly, the boyfriend ordered the chicken nachos... The toppings were really fresh and practically bounced off the nacho... The chicken was also very well-seasoned, in my opinion... Just make sure you get a fork... They really pile those toppings on...   Now with all that fabulousness, here come the parts that didn't fare so well... First, while the ticket attendant was very nice, their process of using a marker instead of just ripping the tickets in half seems a little cumbersome... They are already passing out menus for folks as well, so either having another person with menus or buying actual tickets with stubs would be quicker for busier nights... It wasn't too bad yesterday, but I would be curious to know how it works out in a rush... Second, I'm sure they're still working on the inside the movie service training because it's new, but two things went less than smoothly: one of the servers was wearing jewelry that made noise whenever they walked and the drink service was spotty... I actually didn't even notice the noise until someone pointed it out to me because apparently I was lost in the magical world of James Franco, but afterward, I couldn't miss it... It sounded like bangles clanging against each other... Not really cool in the midst of a hush-hush place like a movie theater... Also, I ordered a beer (not from the button, with one of our three or four servers) and it didn't show up... It showed up on the bill, though and I asked the server about it... He said he could bring it out since there was another 45 minutes left, so he did that... Also, the boyfriend ordered water which never showed up... I think because we had so many people waiting on us, it was easy to miss... Having one server per row or section would probably keep things like that to a minimum... Or maybe I'll just keep pressing the magic button instead of ordering directly from the servers... lol   Overall, I had a ball... I'll definitely be back again... But it's definitely pricey, so watch your wallet... lol",

I think he needs training since the other wait staff had to help him.   The bar was cool and spacious with enough staff and enough seats & couches.  The decoration made it feel like it wasn't a sports bar but there was a few large TV's to watch any games.  the service at the bar was better and I wish it was the same before sitting in the theater.",

    "text": "So the concept of this place is great!  In theory, it's like a modern day drive-in theater.  You have big spacious seats, and each seat has a tray, and waiters come and take your order, and they bring you food (not just popcorn and candy -- but pizza, hamburgers, fries -- and they even served alcohol if you want it).    But here is the down side to this place that the owners really need to work out.  1) The waiters circulate throughout the entire movie!  And to take orders they use iPhones.  So imagine ten people roaming the cinema the entire time with bright iPhones.  So it's hard to focus on the film when people are roaming the cinema for the ENTIRE TIME.    2) Then, if the person next to you wants to place a big order, then the waiter comes and yells over you to get that order.  That's seriously disruptive!    3) Then the manager comes to bring you the check towards the end of the movie.  And in 99% of the cases, the last 30 minutes of the movie are the most intense/exciting/dramatic.  Do you really want a manager asking you to check your order and give him your credit card while you're trying to enjoy the last critical scenes of the film.    Under normal circumstances, I think this place would only merit two stars -- three max.  Again, it's a great concept, but the owners need to work out the kinks to make it more enjoyable.   So why did I give this place one star only?    Well, on my first visit, the kitchen of this place catches on FIRE.  Yes, that's right.  The kitchen caught on fire!  Apparently, they couldn't handle all the orders that were being placed.  So if you're going to market yourself as a big theater that can feed people as they watch movies, you need to have a kitchen that works and is safe.    They had to evacuate the entire cinema.  Everyone was standing out in the cold for 30 minutes until they could get everything under control in the kitchen.  So after the fire, no food was available for the rest of the evening.  And since I was counting on this place serving me dinner, I hadn't eaten before hand.  So I had to sit through the entire long movie hungry and annoyed.    So I won't be going back to this place...",

Likes:  - Stadium seating & extremely comfortable - Nice BIG screens & acoustics were great - Full service food/drink ordering from your seat  - Staff was very welcoming, attentive & friendly. - Great customer service - Located near tons of restaurants & bars - Assigned seating (Arrive before hand to order food/drinks)  Dislikes: - Location: Uptown so be prepared to pay for parking - Waiters brought wrong ticket 4 times - Constantly being asked by staff to pass down tickets & drinks which were wrong so they came back. During the best parts of the freaking movie.  - Popcorn was stale & completely soft (no crunch) - For late comers, staff should have flashlights as people sat in wrong seats which caused confusion to those watching the movie.",

    "text": "Want to sit in the movies and also eat while not being judge having a lot of food during?  This is the place to go.  I really enjoy going to Studio Movie Grill if I want to knock out dinner and a movie.  Why, let break it down.  Parking is pretty good as there is a parking deck for Epicenter, and you can have your ticket validated at the box office!  Don't forget to bring your ticket with you.  Even when there are events around the area and they try to charge you for parking, I just tell the person I'm going to watch a movie, so they give me my ticket to get validated.    The seating is amazing!  Okay, they aren't couches, but they are pretty comfy leather seats.  Also, what I really love about this place is that you can reserve your seats online before going in!  I'm a person who shows up early to movies to get the BEST seat in the center, but if I go to SMG, I never need to rush as I know there shouldn't be anyone else in my seat since I had reserved it!  It's AMAZING.  Also, you can always seem to find Groupon deals for this place, so I score amazing seats with great deals!  Holla!  The service is amazing as well.  Everyone is really pleasant when they help me.  And inside the theater, OMG!!!  When you are sitting in your seat, there are buttons for you to inform a server that you need something.  You don't have to walk out during the movie!!!  This option is great for me as I never even want to get up to use the restroom for fear of missing something important during the movie.  Is it convenient...or just making me lazy...?  I'll just go with convenient.    The food is pretty good as well.  If you there are going to be two in your party, they have a 2 for $25 deal.  They change their menu every now and then, so always check out the options that are available.  They also serve drinks in here!  If you get dragged to go watch a movie that you aren't really feeling but you want to support your significant other, you can still drink and get a buzz.  It might make you get super excited for the movie!  Definitely check this place out, even if it's just once cause it's a pretty cool experience in my opinion.",

    "text": "If all you are doing here is watching a movie and maybe having a drink or two, then this is a great place to do it.  They have a bar outside the theatres to gather at and socialize before or after your movie.  The theatres are comfortable with big chairs that rock slightly and it is stadium seating.  Drinks are good and they even have a couple of local craft beers on tap.  The sound system is decent as well and the walkways are well lit.  The problem here is the food.  After two tries, I have determined it is best to eat before your movie because both times I was severely disappointed in my meal.  This time around I had a California chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Unfortunately, It was too dark to tell but I could swear the chicken was under cooked.  It was quite chewy and I just couldn't stopped eating it for fear of getting sick.  The rest of the sandwich was bland.  The fries were the best thing here but what I ordered was sweet potato fries and I received regular fries.  I had a slice of my friend's pizza and that had to be the most horrible pizza I ever had...even worse than a generic frozen pizza from a local grocery store.  The dough was chewy and it had no flavor.  Friends in front of us had burgers and they said the burgers were decent so maybe that is what to order here.  How badly can you screw up a burger anyway?  The problem here is you want to come for the experience of eating dinner and watching your movie but the dinner part falls flat.  So why come here if 1/2 of the experience is flat?  You might as well head to a normal theater for a better all around experience than to be distracted by other people eating dinner while you are trying to enjoy a movie.  Sorry, SMG, If it weren't for the fact that Carolina Theatre Preservation Society is holding their movies here, I doubt I would be back.   Next time I will eat dinner before I come though.  There are plenty of decent options around the theatre in the Epicentre.",

Everytime i have been there something went wrong from food order being forgotten about or messed up to more than once the movie being paused or sound going out. Well this time takes the cake. Went to see the new marvel movie as part of my birthday treat and then the fire alarms start flashing they pause the movie and a recording keep repeating that an emergency had been reported and we should exit the building but the management at studio movie grill told us to stay put and the food runners kept delivering food like nothing was happening. On the way out i asked a manager how i would go about getting a refund and he said i needed to exit now. I said again will we get a refund and how do we do that he called security in his headset stating a guest was refusing to leave. I was so embarrassed and disrespected. Meanwhile the lobby of the theater was full of ppl so why did i need to leave. Worst experience ever and i will never be back i am still trying to get a ticket refund. Stay clear of this establishment it is horrible. I also never got to see the new marvel movie and don't have another free weekend until End of May so thanks studio movie grill.",

The CIAA menu was very limited, didn't even have popcorn on it, and was insanely overpriced. $15 for 4 chicken tenders and fries!? What the heck? I never got a refill.

Don't try to order food, there will be a problem with your order. One time my friend had to wait until the end of the movie before she record her food, even though we asked 4 different waiters throughout the movie. And they still made her pay full price. Tonight my husband and I had to ask 3 servers before receiving our milkshakes, and then his was completely liquid. It's not worth waiting that long for mediocre food. Servers are often confused and rude.   The women's bathroom (the only one I can speak for). Is always disgusting. Always wet, toilet paper on the floor, and unflushed toilets. Tonight when I went, all 4 sinks were clogged and filled with dirty water and the water had leaked out onto the floor, which was soaking wet. It was impossible to was your hands. Which makes me feel really good about the food that was being made in that place.   I continue to go to SMG solely because it is a convenient theater for me to get to. Don't order food or try to use the bathrooms.",

    "text": "SMG used to be really nice to come to. As of late, the service and the food has been worse than that of the worst street vendor. Last week, we went to SMG with a big party. Only some of us were able to get seats to the movie we wanted to see. They told us the movie was sold out (although we looked a few minutes prior and the theater was more than 80% vacant). After we got our tickets, we were advised that the kitchen was closed. They were only serving candy, popcorn, and soda. That was a bummer, but seeing how we already paid for our tickets there was very little we could do. When asked why the kitchen was closed, they told us that they didn't have cold water... When we got into the theater, we noticed those same seats that showed available before the start of the movie, that they claimed were sold, were available. As a matter of fact, those seats stayed empty for the entire movie.  Some of our party ordered popcorn. The price was $3 for one, or 2-4-$7. When asked about the prices, and if the 2-4-7 offered a larger bag of popcorn, the waiter became clearly agitated. FYI- the bags are the exact same size... you don't get any additional popcorn, or value for that matter. You just get ripped off. Oh yeah, and that popcorn took more than 40 minutes to come out. Ridiculous! Speaking to management after this fiasco, she said that people had called out and the staff could not handle a theater full of people ordering items. Considering the kitchen was closed, I don't see how that would be an issue. However, seeing that they couldn't even serve a basic staple of the theater (popcorn) within a decent amount of time, I had a better understanding.  Management also explained that they do not have to tell the public when they decide to close out a show. That's not our concern. Mind you, they did not update their website, or their phone directory to update those who may be coming from far distances or with large parties. Our last few visits have been less than stellar but easy to overlook. Based on the customer service, the blatant lies, and the attitudes, we will not return. I hope they realize that they are not the only show (no pun intended) in town.",

Also the iPad or device they used to take the orders was so bright as they walked around the cinema with it. Very annoying. I will see the movie again just because I felt I missed things.

They make people  wait in the club area before the movie starts which is extremely awkward.... Once I got in I noticed that the seats were extremely dirty,  stains everywhere! It was disgusting. I still decided to stay since I bought the tickets.  During the movie we could hear the bass thumping from the club.. Lastly,  on our way out we had to walk straight through a ghetto crowd to exit.  This is definitely not the ideal theater to go.  Trust me,  try another option.",

    "text": "My husband and I got a few friends together and I talked them into going all the way uptown to SMG for the opening night of Anchorman2.  I thought that it would be so much easier  and less stressful because you can reserve your seats and therefore no worrying about if it will be so busy we can't sit together-I WAS WRONG. The email I had received as confirmation of my purchase and reservation also made me believe that I had the tickets right there on my phone to scan so I could bypass the ticketing area.  It says: SKIP THE BOX OFFICE WHEN REDEEMING YOUR TICKETS. 1. This confirmation has a unique QR code that can be scanned at the hostess stand(s) located in the lobby. QR codes can be read from your mobile device or print-out. 2. Or, you can use one of our self-service kiosks with your confirmation number or credit card. We got there plenty early (before 7:00pm for 7:30 pm movie because we expected it to be busy) and headed upstairs to get a beverage which we couldn't get because there was a private party (which was ok too-it's Christmas).  So then we went to the theatre entrance (located upstairs in this location), and the ticketing agent told us that they do not have a scanner so we would have to go back downstairs to get our ticket.  I was still not terribly disappointed, I understand it takes time to roll out new technology but once we got downstairs is really when I feel our whole movie experience went bad.  We went to the kiosk and put in our confirmation numbers at separate kiosks and got a message on the screen that said \"Error please contact tech support.\"  So by this time a line was building for the ticketing area and we waited in that line for someone to help us.  A redhead with bangs was training another girl who told us that the tickets are over there, and they had printed out-the tone she used was like we were supposed to already know that? Then she went to grab them and one set was gone, I thought-\"ok she can just print us another set of tickets\" but that was not the case either.  She made a call to the manager and didn't explain what the process was or what we needed to do to resolve the problem.  She just told me to step aside until someone can come resolve this.  By this time I am frustrated I have been there over 30 mins and haven't even come close to entering the theatre... I said I would like to wait here with her for a manager because I don't know who they are or how long it will take for a manager to come down to the ticketing area or even what needs to be done.  She then got very rude and impatient with me, and I thought I just wanted someone to tell me why another set couldn't be printed out or why I can't just show my receipt upstairs?  I really was trying to be nice and keep a smile on my face because we really were trying to have a nice night out with friends, she must've thought I was getting some joy out this painful process because she then told me that this wasn't funny and mimicked my laugh (because once she told me that it wasn't funny I couldn't help but laugh at her childish and less than customer friendly behavior). Finally another gentleman from behind the same counter stepped in when she started making a huge deal because I wouldn't just go away  and he said I can help you.  I wish I knew his name because I would put it in here as the guy who saved the evening from being a total disaster.  He said come with me and took us upstairs to gather the rest of our party and walked us into the theatre.  If it wasn't for him I don't know how the night would have gone, but the customer service of the girl at the ticket counter was appalling. If she would have just had a better attitude and explained what was going on instead of making me feel stupid and like my time doesn't matter that it would have been easily resolved instead of her being confrontational and feeling like I am holding my own sit in like a protestor.  It was some of our groups first time and they will not be going back, not sure if we will either if the staff treat there customers like this.",

I also give it 3 stars because the staff is always very friendly and the building itself is very nice.  the seats are big and comfy and the ladies' room is clean. Theater is always clean and the picture/sound quality is good.  Mostly impressed with the friendly staff! The movie price is good and the menu is reasonably priced too.   My complaint is always simply slow service, and i only put the review here, hoping that perhaps the system can be corrected in the future because i really like going there!   There were 3 people in the theater including myself, but it took 30 minutes to receive my soda, and over 45 to get my food. After asking about the food twice and finally getting up from the movie to go out and ask where it was, I received it, and I was happy with the way that it was handled. I will return and when something changes between the kitchen and the theater, i will surely raise my stars.",

What is really annoying is how you can not swipe your credit card or order food right from your seat. The great thing about the Movie Tavern is there is tons of room between the seats and the staff rarely block your view. At the studio grill, there is not a ton of room between the rows or seats. I can not really see the Movie Grill removing seats. For me, I hope to one day see Movie Grill enhancing the overal experience.   BTW I see the negative reivews for \"Theater five.\" I saw \"unfinished business\" at theater five and there were not any issues. If there was an issue it has been fixed.",

The bartenders are extremely inattentive. When I first walked up to the bar, no one greeted me and I had to wait about 5 min and finally I spoke up and asked for service. TWICE. The second time I went back was because my drink was terrible. I got no apology, no one seemed like they wanted to help me until I spoke up and asked for some attention. The girl that had originally served me was to busy counting money and putting away glasses to even acknowledge me. Or so I thought, because someone she knew walked up and she got them a drink right away.  I am a person who believes in tipping well for great customer service and that bar is not worthy. They have no courtesy about their service and I will NEVER go back to this location.",

Then as we were leaving the staff were openly discussing how they were frustrated about not getting a tip from one of the other customers.

The food and drinks are reasonably priced so you won't feel like you're breaking the bank. The only downfall to this theatre is the staff. They hire a lot of young people that honestly don't know how to properly serve. There are times when I get a good worker, but then there are times when I get someone that honestly doesn't care about their job and it completely ruins my experience (do not come when called, brings food late and cold, gives wrong bill, etc.)",

Until......the \"fast service\". Apparently fast is not always key. The tenders came out far too quickly...and FAR TOO raw. Not just slightly undercooked--but completely transparent and flash fried for for what seemed like less than a minute. This particular mistake is completely unacceptable. I'm the assistant general manager at a restaurant here in Charlotte and I am absolutely appalled. The theatre wasn't busy at all--in fact we were literally the only two people in the theatre.   The server also came back apologizing(I realize it wasn't his fault), but a manager didn't come out to speak with us. Worried to see if in fact they addressed the cook...hopefully no one ordered chicken tenders for their children.

That trickles from the top so, also the management is garbage.   Over 25 minutes to receive water. Food (from the all you can eat special) arrived before the wine. The wine in which took over 30 minutes to receive.   When getting our bill we realize they charged 2, pizza specials. We had to spend more time at that theatre to have them fix the issue - and then get confirmation via receipt that it was properly refunded.   The only constant when coming here is knowing welll leave SEVERLY disappointed.",

My friends had their food before the previews ended. I waited patiently assuming my food would come. It never did. An hour into the movie I asked about my food and was told it was \"on the way\". 15 mins later still no food. So I pressed the service button and asked again. After another 10 minutes I gave up and asked to have my order canceled. Our movie was basically over. No one offered an apology or explanation or even cared to let me know what happened to my order. If I could give 0 stars I would.",

    "text": "As far as the theater aspect goes, it's a theater. The seats a pretty comfy and you can select them ahead of time. The dining aspect, flat out sucks. You honestly never know what kind of experience you're going to get here. More often than not, everything comes out extremely late/slow.  During my most recent visit this past Saturday, my wife and I had one of the worst visits to SMG Epicenter we've ever had. We went to a 9:45 showing, and our theater was maybe 30-40% full at max. I thought this would mean our meals would be quick, especially with it being such a late showing and most people eating dinner beforehand. We ordered our food at 9:45 (two orders of coconut crusted chicken tenders + fries and two waters). Simple, yes? Well at about 10:30, our 'food' came out. However they brought our the incorrect order ... 1 regular chicken tenders + 1 coconut tenders. I told them that we didn't get the regular tenders and assumed they brought the them to the wrong seat and it'd be a quick fix. My mistake. Literally another 30 minutes go by (now 1:15 past when I ordered them) and my food nor our waters had come out. About 11pm after asking two different servers, I was finally brought out my food.   On top of this food debacle, they are supposed to bring out your checks 30+ minutes before the movie ends. Welp, this did not happen. So, the movie ended and everyone flocked out. More than half the checks just kept walking and didn't sign, which means the servers don't get any tips. Sucks for them, but honestly it's their fault for not delivering the check so it's hard to feel too bad for them.   This is not our first experience like this, sadly. Has the opportunity to be such a great time.   TL;DR: Go for the movie, skip the meal",

Also, on top of all of that our movie started extra late the theater wasn't that clean they had nowhere for all of the people to stand while waiting on the movie and a nightclub started in the middle of us waiting on our movie so there was people all over the place waiting on a late movie to start and others partying.",

First, they validate parking which was a relief. Second, the e-ticket check in was really easy. You can even pick your seat you want in the app.   The theater was nice. A smaller room than most but it had a nice, intimate feel. Each seat had a tray and cupholder. Mine had a few crumbs on it from the previous show. Not a big deal, but I did notice. The seats are really comfortable. They don't recline but they are padded and there is a ton of leg room. The leg room is mostly for the servers to get through the aisle easier but it allows you to stretch out.  The service was pretty good, you press a button on the tray and a server comes out to take your order. All in all, it's a pretty cool experience. They didn't have a ton of beer options but they did have the local brewery I like on tap so I was happy.  Overall, good experience. I'd go again.",

The service was slow as usual and the food was just ok, and they really need to get some happier people working there because all of their attitudes suck!  But what really got me was the type of crowd!  I was disappointed with how many people around us were talking during the entire movie.  Laughing ridiculously loud or clapping every other scene, talking out loud to everyone about every move they saw or thought was coming...with no security in sight to stop them or kick them out if they didn't stop!  I barely could enjoy the movie and experience.  I really would recommend to this theater to have some security around and inside, and highly recommend they adopt AMC's policies on \"no talking during the movie\" by showing a reminder and having staff on hand to monitor.  Something definitely needs to change because we won't be returning for a while now.",

The idea of French fries, burgers, and legal beer drinking was definitely inspiring .... and the menu actually had several choices. They have a few different pasta choices, flat breads and good looking pizza. They have 5 burger choices......   I arrived about 15 mins before the movie started.... naturally I was a little confused with the notion of pushing a button for service... but like clock work and cheery waitress showed up and took our order.....  My burger was decent .... I got the Megatron Burger with mushrooms and bacon and all things glorious!! It was just ok thou..... not necessarily bad and not necessarily good.... but I went with the flow because nearly every seat in the theater was taken and I imagined the kitchen was completely backed up.... my wife on the other hand ordered a salad and that salad took literally 1 hour to arrive and was salty when it did..... my fries were deliciously fried but not warm enough to even make it thru ten mins.....  Over all I enjoyed the heck outta the movie and the experience.... I will definitely be returning to the movies.",

We could hear their conversation (they were not trying to have a private conversation...)...both were trashing the business and fellow employees.  Someone approached the bar and asked about the food...they told the customer that it was terrible to not order...she thanked them for saving her and walked away.  I called out again to our bartender and she approached - no greeting... looked at us... I asked about the food...said I heard what she told the other customer. She said that it was fine, but they were out of a lot of things.  We ordered wine and waited for our movie.  Once in the theater service was slow. The waiter said they were short handed and repeated that they were out of most everything on the menu.  We found an item that they still had, waited and saw it delivered to the couple in front of us.  Talked to the manager who essentially just shrugged and said again that they were short handed.

Be sure to get the Groupon deal before you go to save 50% ticket price.  The drink and food are pretty reasonable for an uptown movie theater. The chair is very comfortable. Also, they offer 4 hours of free parking from the time you parked, just make sure your valided your parking ticket.  The only thing is there's very limited movie showing and seating. so if you know the movie is heat especially during weekend go early to buy the tickets if yo don't want to sit in the front row.",

The server who took our order was condescending and repeatedly referred to me as darlin and sweetheart (not in a typical southern hospitality kind of way). We ordered our food and drinks came right away, and shortly after we got our appetizer, and that was all she wrote. Our entrees came after a solid hour, and both were cold, which tells us they'd been sitting for a while. We requested they correct this, and we never got our entrees within a reasonable amount of time, and the movie was nearing the end. We cancelled the orders altogether at that point. The staff were rude and didn't seem to acknowledge any real issue with our concerns, and asked if we wanted our food to go, since they charged us. The manager was very accommodating and seemed overwhelmed with the amount of customer complaints, that were all like ours. We did get a full refund, and at least the movie was good.   The most disappointing thing was my boyfriend raves about this place and had long wanted to take me. We are from out of town and it was on our list of things to do in Charlotte. My advice, until they revamp the entire place and get rid of staff, build from the ground up, do not go there.",

It is much better than the similar concept theater, Cinebarre in the Arboretum (uncomfortable seating and overpriced low-quality food).  The last two times I went there, however, I had poor experiences...  I went to see Hunger Games with a group of friends and the theater was really busy. Our food took a long time to get there. Once I got my food, it was cold with congealed dipping sauce. They also served my vegetarian friend food packed with bacon after she requested no bacon. Then, they charged her twice for her meal. They did give me return passes, so I was ready to forgive and forget.   I went to see Star Wars with the same friend and once again they were really busy. However, they claimed they were having a special menu when we arrived. It was actually a limited menu because of some sort of electricity failure. I ended up ordering popcorn that was old, overpriced, and way too salty. By the time our movie was over, we saw servers walking around with trays of food. Meanwhile, we were starving because we had basically skipped lunch on account of our pre-purchased tickets. We picked a movie theater that served food for a reason. Once again, they gave me return passes.  I am unsure if I just had two isolated poor experiences or if SMG has gone downhill.  I look forward to re-evaluating this review in the future and hope I will be able to raise my rating.",

    "text": "So I think you're enjoyment level on why you're coming here improves if you're expecting a movie with pub food (basically), and not a fancy restaurant with a movie playing.  If you're expecting the latter then this isn't the ideal place for you.  It's probably best if you split your day up with a nice meal out (Morton's perhaps) then follow it up with a movie.  If you're expecting the earlier, then I believe you're in for much more of an enjoyable experience at Studio Move Grill.  Biggest pro is that you're all in one date night/movie out is assured. It's a one stop shop for food, drinks, snacks, and of course the movie of your choice.  The seats aren't the most comfortable I've ever experienced, but they were still quite nice with a bit of recline to them to really make the sale.  :)  Each had their own little table to eat from with a small drink holder available as well.   My only partial complain about that is my plate was sliding around.  I couldn't figure out why.  :-/  I ordered the sliders (beef), with fruit, and popcorn.  I know, normally I'd go with fries but the popcorn and fries combo would have made me hate myself to much.  This at least made me feel a bit not so bad about myself.  We order about 5 mins before the movie (previews) started, and received our food just before the movie started.  So it worked out that we didn't miss anything.  Although honestly should have ordered a bit sooner so I could SEE the fruit I was stuffing into my mouth.    The sliders were good, not over cooked, with soft buttery buns of goodness showing them some love.  Each bite was actually quite delightful. The fruit that accompanied it was actually very tasty and fresh.  It wasn't like a typical fruit bowl, because it didn't all taste like pineapple (which seems to overpower everything).  Instead (or in this case) the grapes, pineapple, cantaloupe, and melon were all tasty and had their own individual flavors!  :)  The popcorn was... well... popcorn.  I imagine if they would have messed that one up it would have been an instant 1 in the review.  How can you be a cinema and mess up popcorn?  LOL  So that was fine, no issues there!  Movie itself was bright, nice sound, and no noise throughout the movie (more patrons than movie, but whatever).  So it was all in all a VERY enjoyable experience, which I would be happy to repeat provided I'm in the area.  Last follow up (main review is done, if you like it, check this place out!)... I had the sweet tea for my drink.  It's brewed, which isn't typical outside of restaurants, so that was a treat for me and it was quite good.  So... the end!",

After I hit the service button, asked where our drinks were, I was told they were sorry and our drinks will b up shortly.  They never came. So, I hit the service button again. No one came. After that I hit the surrounding seats service buttons and someone popped right up. Already apologizing for our drinks not coming. I asked to speak to a manager. I was told I can take my receipt..of items that I didn't receive..to the manager afterwards. I asked to speak to the manager now. Then I was told I can walk with them (while the movie I paid for was on) to go see the manager. All while both servers that came were puttin it on the people with black shirts without owning responsibility. While the movies ending. The server comes back and tries to hand me a bill. I'm like why do I have a bill I didn't get anything to drink from you guys. Not even a water. While everyone else in the theater received their items expeditiously. This is my 5th time here after this so called remodel and new management and every time I received poor service. When you guys first opened, I frequented just about every week...especially since I live uptown. Now not so much because of this. Terrible customer service was provided.",

We decided to take a chance and returned last night to courteous staff, a clean theater and almost a return to its former prestige. Our food was delivered promptly, however...it took three attempts with three different staff members and 3/4 of the movie to get one small merlot which was served in the same sort of tumbler as the watered down Jack Daniels we had also ordered 75 minutes prior to its arrival. Now of course the bill was delivered even faster than our food! Interestingly enough no one seemed to forget to place the overdue drinks on our check just on our table! Tie up some loose ends and train staff on a few odds and ends and we may come back again in a few months.",

    "text": "So I have been coming to the theater for the past 4 years. Sure over those past year studio movie grill has had some... Bad service, or some movie issues... But never like I have experienced this time!   First of all I will say that every time I go to the studio movie grill I almost always regret it because people talk a lot, and the servers are usually in the way. I just personally like a darker quieter place.   This time the server right off the bat had a nasty attitude with me and my friend, kind of like she didn't want to even be at work. When we tried to order she would roll her eyes, and act like our order was to much. Yes it was a bigger order, but still, that is her job. They were out of almost every drink we wanted! I don't know how you run out of drinks on a Friday, but it happened.   So finally after about 30 mins into the movie, our drinks come out, water down of course.  Food comes out half way into the movie, of course cold. The server never came back so we had to call a new one to tel them that she forgot half of our order! Finally when the movie was 3/4 over we get all of our cold food!  After spending over $100 and having 3 servers total. I was so ready to get out of that place! Like I said, I know places can have bad days here and there, but enough was enough!   So the next day I called the theater to talk to a manager, was on hold for 20 mins when one of the host says they would leave my name and number for management to call me back because they have an event and can't get to me right now.  A week passes and no call so I call back again.... And guess what... Get the same answer....  So another week passes and finally they connect me to a manager!!!!  And all the manager says is... \"Sorry, we don't do movie passes anymore, so next time you need to let someone know while you are here so we can fix it. Other then that, that's all I can do.\"   What a terrible answer for someone that lives 6 mins away, and comes all the time and spends over $100!   So that will be the last time I go to SMG, at least until they get a entire new staff! (Besides the girl that takes the tickets with the big hair! She's always nice!)",

    "text": "We were told the theater wasn't ready yet. The movie started at 9:15 at 9:14 the girl who takes the tickets very rudely told us the theater wasn't ready yet. When I inquired about an ETA she rudely replied the movie didn't start until 9:15 disregarding the fact that it was 9:14. Finally at about 9:17 we were told the theater was ready. We got to our seats that we brushed off and stared at a blank screen. Finally at about 9:25 the screen came on. At about the same time the waiter (Who was the only bright spot during this whole ordeal) came over to take our orders. Even though we all ordered at the same time our meals came out separately five minutes apart until the last two orders that came out 15 and 20 minutes later than the first orders. I ordered a black bean burger, received a regular burger. Our server apologized and placed the order again. Half way through the movie I finally received my cold food. Before we left we attempted to pay our bill, the computer was not working so we moved to a different computer. While our server attempted to cash out our orders the manager cut in front of us to cash out other customers like we weren't standing there. Then he interrupted our server again while he was in the middle of cashing us out. When I attempted to tell the manager about our experience he told me to \"hurry up and give him the short version so he could take something off my bill.\" I declined. I wasn't sharing my experience so he could simply \"take something off my bill\". I also wanted to compliment our server. He could careless. There are really great employees...the servers and then there is everyone else. Unprofessional, rude and indifferent. The worst of the employees seem to mimic the manager's I don't give a damn attitude. The best of the employees (the servers) try hard to make up for the short comings. I recommend you spend your money else where and avoid the frustration.",

Even being the first to arrive, it took over30 minutes to receive a glass of the house wine, and 20 Minutes to receive the next one. The lack of written communication means that you have to TALK during the movie to place an order. And then when the check comes, the server insists on interacting with you to give you the check. \"It's your BILL!\" she groused. Just be discreet and drop it off and pick it up. We're watching a movie. Sheesh. Other venues have this all figured out.",

    "text": "Let me start off with literally the only 2 complaints that I have about this theatre. You buy your tickets one floor below the actual theatre. Back in the day you would buy your tickets and take the escalator up from right there. Now you have to go back outside and either take the stairs up or wait on the elevator to go back up to the floor with the theatre. Its too much. You'll have to make sure to get your parking validated while you are here or you'll have to stop back through on your way out.  They also do not get a good variety of movies. No \"Urban\" movies ever come to this theatre. What do ya'll have against Tyler Perry and his following??? lol. But no really, they are really closed minded when it comes to their selection.  Now for everything I love, which is literally everything else! I don't know how people who come here can really complain about seeing the servers coming in and out. Ummmm its a MOVIE GRILL! If you're not going to be open to a different movie experience, why would you come here with such a closed mind? Walking into our designated theatre we were greeted with smiles and mints. We walked in and found our seats... which by the way, you can reserve!! How awesome is that??? The VIP seats on the side and the back are the best. They are not an extra charge, just first come first serve. When we sat down we were immediately greeted by a waiter. He took our drink orders and answered any questions we had about the menu. I came with 2 other people and was the last to order, by the time he got to me, one of my friends appetizers were already out!! They are FAST!!! We ordered appetizers and entrees and were finished eating by the time the previews were finished. I was REALLY surprised with how awesome the food tasted. I mean we were literally excited as we ate. We tried each others food and when we finished sat there with the ITIS!! I recommend the Quesadillas, Chicken Wings and Fries!! Their salads were also really big and good. Everytime I hit the button on my chair to call my waiter, he was there quickly. I love that button.  I like the way they remodeled the theatres. Before, I could easily hear what was going on outside in the bar. Now I can truly enjoy the movie. My movie was pretty packed recently so there was a lot of movement with servers, but it didn't bother me at all. I just paid attention to the movie. They also don't just stand around in your way so honestly I barely noticed them. And again, it's a movie grill, what do you expect.  I am constantly looking for movies coming out to have an excuse to come back. I love this experience!",

    "text": "How does one ruin the moviegoing experience...let me tell you.   First, only two people were working the tickets so there was a line almost out the door...and this is on a Monday @7.  I used the machines to get my own ticket but it was so dark I could barely see.  It was assigned seating and of course when I got to my seat we were all bunched together...which I hate.  Second, there are no concessions but you rather order from a server once you are seated.  So I order a popcorn and soda.  The soda comes about 30 minutes later, in a huge plastic glass, with no ice, and its warm.  I never got the popcorn.  Third, when I ordered I tried to close out the tab then and there but was told I couldn't...something about \"the law\" not allowing it.  I don't remember learning that in law school so it must be a state law thing...Fourth, I was never brought my check (and actually never saw the server again after he brought me my soda) and when I flagged down a server he couldn't find my bill, and told me it was on the house.  Now I have to keep an eye out for my card statement to make sure I wasn't charged some random amount (they can have the $5 for the popcorn).    I get that this place is trying to go fancy.  There is a full menu, nice leather seats, and you push a button to get your server.  But all of these things should make things better, and in this case, for whatever reason, it made them worse.  I would have rather had a concession stand and been able to sit where I wanted...I won't be going back.",

    "text": "Long gone are the days of a new, shiny theater. Here are the days of a worn down, but newly claimed movie house serving food and drinks to your seat.  I was under the assumption that when new owners take over they also fix up the place. I was pretty disappointed that the atmosphere really showed its wear and tear from the last few years.   The seats themselves, however, are still just as comfy as before. Each seat is a good one and still a big bonus that they are assigned. Whew, the anxiety of finding a seat in a packed theater doesn't exist here.  While I think it's a good concept to eat and watch a movie (since I often practice this at home), there were times I would get distracted by the servers running up and down the aisles (not for lack of an intense movie). Minimal distractions though and not enough to prevent me from returning.   I'll have to give it another go, but it definitely wasn't as appealing and shiny when I first came here (when it was the Epicentre Theaters).",

    "text": "Having worked in customer service I understand sometimes things don't go as planned but this was a horrible experience from start to finish. Wanting to get dinner and a movie my friends and I decided to try this place out. Worst mistake ever.  With the location being at the epicenter we hoped for a good time. Because of the size of our group (6 people) we wanted to make sure we could all sit together so we purchased our tickets four hours before the start of the movie. When we went to purchase tickets online none of the seats in the theater had been reserved. We chose seats 8-13. When it came to checkout the website started messing up so after several attempts we decided to head up there to make sure we had those seats. The ladies I spoke to upfront seemed clueless and annoyed. I asked to purchase seats 8-13 and she said they had been blocked off because we tried to purchase them online. She said the online reservations had been messing up it was an ongoing issue. I asked if she could make sure they were our seats (if they weren't we would have gotten other seats). She couldn't tell me if it was us who had reserved those seats but since they were the only ones booked she said she would give us tickets to the worst seats and we would just sit in 8-13. After two ladies up from assured me those would be our seats I thanked them and left. Little did I know it would be a huge ordeal come showtime. After showing up half an hour before the movie started they told us it would be just a few minutes before we could be seated.  We had to wait outside the theatre for 20 minutes for it to be cleaned. Once we finally settled into our seats 8-13 we ordered our food. A group of people came up and said they had reserved the seats up to seat 11.. I let them know the situation and the server said they must have double booked and that group sat in other seats in different rows. As soon as the food came out the manager came to tell us we were in the wrong seats. After explaining the situation and agreeing with us that the lady I spoke to upfront was wrong he still rudely asked us to move seats. At this point the movie was starting, the whole theatre was basically filled and our actual seats were \"the worst in the theatre\" aka front row. After we didn't budge because our dinner was in front of us and it wasn't our fault it was his staffs fault he came back and gave us 5 free movie passes (there were  6 of us). Thanks but we definitely won't be going back. During the movie people were talking loudly, the servers were walking around the entire time, and it was absolutely freezing in the theatre (even being dressed for the snow outside and wearing my ski jacket I was cold). When we asked for coffee to warm us up it took 30 minutes for them to tell us they didn't have decaf which was fine but then they let us know that at this point they had already dumped the regular coffee for the night. Then came the checks. We got over charged and it looked as if other people in the theatre did too because of how many times the servers had to go back and fourth up and down the stairs. Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had. Do not waste your time or money.",

I've been here twice since the \"new\" company took over and as a bouncer who used to work here back when it was Mez, I can tell you, they have really screwed the pooch on this one. The first time I went must have been right after they opened and the pizza I got was ok. Pretty big size but not all that flavorful and too hard to eat. Little did I know that compared to the pizza they serve now it would seem like the best pizza in the world! I went about a month ago and got the \"never ending\" pizza and I swear the regular one was a crappy microwavable pizza smaller than my hand and so I then tried the thin crust and it was even worse!!! The dough was raw and as limp as a noodle. Service is horrendous!!! They screw up everything and don't seem to care at all. I think the server laughed when we asked for a refill of our popcorn because he couldn't believe that we called him all the way there just for that...lol. Very strange that they haven't looked on here and tried to fix anything. This place will not be open long. Why would you make horrible food that is messy at a PRIME SPOT in the busiest part of Charlotte???? Makes no sense! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!",

    "text": "I went to see a movie at SMG last night, against my better judgement as I feel every time I go there I have a negative experience. Last night was by far my worst movie experience. My grind and I had movie gift certificate and when he tried to book online we were unable to so we called to have are seats reserved. When we called and explained the situation, the girl we spoke to responded \"I can't do that\" in regards to reserving our seats using our movie passes. She was very unhelpful and make no effort to help us. My friend and I ended up buying tickets online even though we had free tickets. When we got to the theater we each ordered a glass of wine before the movie started. 1 hour into the movie we still did not have our drinks so we turned out light on and eventually someone came over to us and told us the bar is backed up. It had been an hour, and I don't think the bar being backed up is an acceptable excuse. The person then when checking on our orders put in another order for our wine. 1 hour and 15 minutes we got our wine that we ordered before the movie began. When we got our bills at the end we were charged for 2 glasses of wine each when we only had one. It took another 30 minutes to take the 2nd glass of wine off our bills and had to go through 3 very rude and unprofessional people. Our entire bill should have been refunded. We then talked to the manager who talked in circles about how crazy the night had been, again not something the customer needs to hear about. We were not refunded our movie tickets or drinks which should have been a no-brainer. I can't stress enough how rude and unprofessional the servers and management were at SMG. It was like dealing with feet in headlights. This was not a 1 time experience from 1 person. I've heard similar things from others. I will not be going back to SMG and will discourage others from going there as well. Ruined my whole movie experience.",

We ordered pizza and popcorn before the movie even started, we asked twice if it was coming out and we were told that they were very busy. I can understand that but how hard is it to make popcorn? We finally got the pizza with about thirty minutes left of the movie. We never received the popcorn, yet it was still on our bill and we had to ask to have it removed. Overall we were really disappointed and will probably think twice before heading here again.",

It's funny, the opening video roll talks about how the quality of food is superior and makes you excited you may have a great meal. We ordered a 2 for $25 deal which seems like a good deal until you get the food. The 1/2 order of chicken nachos may not have even had chicken. We couldn't find it! It was just chips and lettuce. I'd hate to see a full order after knowing the 1/2 order size. I ordered the chicken fajita quesadilla which was okay, but not very warm. My boyfriend reported he's had better burgers at Wendy's and his fries were cold. I noticed that people who ordered after us received their food before us. The staff replaced the fries no problem, and they were hot, except they charged me for a side of fries at the end of the movie. When I explained, they took it off no problem. The staff was really nice and they did a great job. Just stinks they have to serve terrible food! That being said, I would probably go back for another movie if I had a Groupon to buy again, but stick with a soda and popcorn. For as rare as I go to the movies, I would most likely go to a regular movie theater next time.",

We had never been there before and according to the elevator we needed to go to the 3rd floor. after doing so, we had to walk through a small crowd of people that were at a bar right beside the theater. we get inside and were told that we have to go down stairs to get our tickets. The theater was not impressive at all. We did not order anything bis or special, just teas, chips and salsa, and 2 chicken tender meals and it took us approximately 30 minutes to get our drinks and chips and then about 3 minutes later out chicken tenders came out. No one came back to check on us the entire time. Even when the check was brought to us, the empty plates were not taken away until i asked someone walking by if they could take it. When we left, the crowd at the bar beside the theater was huge and we had to push our way through them. Needless to say, neither of us were impressed and I do not think that we will be returning!",

The waiter said we could switch with the couple so we did. It was unnecessary confusion.. The waiter took my order immediately. Drinks soon came out. Me and my fiance then waited 1.5 hours for our entrees and appetizers which all came out at the same time. A waitress looked at me and was talking and i asked her what the problem was and she showed her back to me and didn't acknowledge me. I had to ask 5 waiters where my food was. What made it worse was their menu didn't have half of the listed food because a oven blew up. My food was cold and my mixed drink felt like it been left out for a hour then served to me. Only reason I am giving it a 2 star and not 1 is because the waiter comped my meal. It was a nice gesture, but waiting a hour and a half when i was hungry ruined the movie for me and the wait was not worth the product you got. I wont be returning again.",

    "text": "Don't get your hopes up... I SO badly wanted this to be a pleasant time. See, my friend's mum reserved tickets as a birthday present for me and naturally I was thrilled. We came in and sat down, cleanliness was alright.. and the customer service seemed okay? So we sat down and I ordered my drinks- then dinner for me and my sister- the drinks came with the appetizer after a very long twenty minutes but I still had high hopes. Then the entree never came. I kid you not- I sat through almost ALL of Captain America listening to everyone else eat and wondering if I had done something wrong. So I couldn't really pay attention to the movie because the waiters kept walking in front of us. WE WERE IN THE FRONT ROW!? How do you miss somebody in the FRONT ROW?!!? So when a waiter eventually came by and said the food would be out in the near future I asked to speak with a manager because I had no intention of paying for food that takes over an hour to arrive- I wasn't even hungry at that point. Okay- so then there was the manager who took her sweet time about checking in on us (and of course they brought the food out and played stupid), I asked if she wanted to talk outside of the theater namely because hearing was almost impossible with the obscene amount of explosions taking place in the film. She declined. I told her I hadn't touched the entree and I rightly deserved a discount or something to compensate given it was my birthday. So then she hands me free tickets to another movie and informs me that  have to pay full price for food that came out cold and flat drinks that were refilled hourly. Because that is EXACTLY what I wanted!!! To come back and receive horrible customer service TWICE!?? Of course I took them because I'm past keeping my pride (I know they don't care) and there I was- April 19th with two tickets and a forty-dollar bill in my hand. Thank you SOOO much for these tickets, even though I'll never use them. I hope this takes one of your 3.5 stars down.",

Parking at the epicenter was fairly easy and the movie theater validates so HELLO FREE PARKING! Coming here straight after work I was rather hungry so I ordered the BBQ Bacon cheeseburger which comes with fries. The burger was delicious! next time just ordering it without the onions (yuck). The fries were good but lacking a good portion size the whole thing was served in a cereal size bowl. I would have liked it on a plate and with MORE FRIES... server was only ok, his name was Lacy he just wasn't very nice.. didn't smile and then didn't bring me napkins when I ordered a burger and fries? I have to ask for napkins? ordered a Blue Margarita to go with it was good but there again the service was lacking. Overall I would definitely go again just next time ordering the popcorn!",

My husband and I went here tonight and read the reviews ahead of time, so we knew what we were walking in to. We ordered the raspberry crush mojito from the menu before the show, and the bartender didn't know what it was. We ended up getting drinks with no raspberries or mint and not resembling mojitos at all. We ordered just popcorn and cheese fries for the show. The popcorn came right away, but the fries didn't show up for a while, and when they did, they weren't hot. We asked to send them back, but they never came. We asked them what happened and when they finally arrived they were hot, and the server apologized profusely and removed it from the bill. Sketchy service at best and I am guessing this is due to not having dedicated servers, and rather a pool of servers running about.i will mention the cheese fries were good once they came out hot.",

    "text": "DO NOT GO HERE. This is a tourist trap who cares nothing about their business. If you want a terrible night, go here. I took my wife here to see Star Wars because it's her favorite movie series ever. She was so excited. When we arrive, the floor throughout the entire  building is so sticky I can hear my shoes sticking as I walk- I mean in the lobby, the bar area, the bathrooms, and the theater. The bar tender barely even looks at anyone when people arrive, and when I ask if there is a food menu he literally says, \"it's right in front of you.\" (It was actually across the room). Then, the move is supposed to start at 7pm but at 7pm some kid who works there says \"it's not ready.\" So we wait, and finally get in at 7:15. We order food from another kid who doesn't know how to use the iPad thing that they order on. The food comes about 20 minutes later, and they got my wife's order wrong. I called over (yet another) server and tell her that it's wrong, and she says \"well I don't know what it's supposed to look like.\" Without giving me a chance to just keep the food, she takes it away and doesn't come back for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, I go use the bathroom and it the absolute DIRTIEST bathroom I have ever seen. Only one of the two paper towel dispensers was working, there was only soap in one of the soap dispensers, trash everywhere on the floor, water everywhere. Finally, our food comes and it's COLD. We just eat it. Meanwhile, everyone we encountered was incredibly rude and disinterested. When we left there was literally a line at the checkout of people whose order were wrong. Finally, the movie was turned up so loud I had to put ear plugs in. My wife was very upset, and I was sad for her because it's her favorite movie. Truly the worst movie experience I have ever had. This place gives Uptown Charlotte a bad name. It's a lazy, disorganized establishment that's not worthy of our city.",

I would much rather go to a regular movie theater where I have to order my food and drinks from the cashier.  We sat down at 3:20 pm for a 3:30 pm movie and immediately pushed the button so we could order our beers and our food....after 30 minutes we asked why we weren't getting served and we were told that they only had two servers for the entire theater (I'm not sure how this place is in business when it's run by people that aren't aware that Christmas is a popular movie-going time and they might need more people than they have working on a typical Monday). Around 4:15 pm, someone came and took our order and things were looking up...until an hour went by and nothing had been delivered (we ordered wine, beer, popcorn and potato skins).  I went to try to find out what was going on and to see if we could at least get our drinks and maybe some of that pre-popped popcorn.  I was directed to a manager.  I asked him if they were planning on compensating customers who never received their ordered (considering there was only 30 minutes left of our movie and we were made to pre-pay at the time of ordering).  The manager, who was clearly flustered from other unhappy customers and not equipped to handle high-stress situations, gave me the same standard \"we're under-staffed but you'll get your food\" answer. I didn't want to miss any more of my movie (and a line of more unhappy movie-goers was forming) so I headed back to the theater where we got our potato skins about 20 minutes before the movie ended and our drinks about 10 minutes later.  The people that work there are nice and apologetic but powerless and managed by people who don't know how to problem-solve.  I won't be back but I'd like to offer these people a tip:  Get ahead of the problem once you know you're understaffed (pass out free popcorn and sodas to all customers along with some movie passes or $5 coupons...some people might still be annoyed but a lot of people will appreciate you doing more than just pathetically repeating your excuse to solve the problem)",

    "text": "Absolutely horrible experience, and will not be returning again. My two guests and I came to this theater for the first time tonight, and none of us had an enjoyable experience. Before the previews started, we placed our food and beverage orders with Jourdan. After being told that they were out of our first drink choices, it took over fifteen minutes to actually get our beverages. Thirty minutes into the movie, my meal and my friend's appetizer arrived. At this time, I requested condiments and a refill from the food runner. Twenty minutes after that, I still had not received anything I had asked for, nor had my friends received their meals. I managed to stop Jourdan on his way past and questioned where our other meals were, to which he responded with \"what food?\" I then had to re-order our missing dinners, as well as my drink and condiment. Over an hour into the movie, our missing dinners finally arrived, however they were barely warm. By this point, my food was ice cold as well (granted this was my own fault, as I had foolishly decided to wait to eat with my friends, not knowing how long it was going to take). Eventually another server dropped off our bill, just before the movie ended. I still never got anything I asked for, additionally, I had been double charged for our meals. After leaving the theater, I requested to speak to a manager to deal with these issues, and was informed to wait in line (he already had two groups in front of me, complaining). After waiting 15 minutes, a female employee came over and informed me that my food was comped. That in itself earned them their 1 star. However, the employee then began to make excuses and tell me how I could have avoided the whole situation by \"asking to speak to a manager as soon as your food took a long time\" and \"get a manager when you got your bill\". That is NOT how you handle an unhappy guest! I was there to watch the movie and enjoy the food I paid for, not to miss it by talking to a manager in the middle of it. The employee didn't seem to understand this concept, however, and just repeated that she took the food off my bill, and next time, to talk to a manager as soon as a situation arrives. There will definitely not be a next time. We will not be returning to this theater again. Your servers and runners need to be better trained in their jobs, and your management needs to be more professional and taught how to treat and take care of their guests!",

You would think they would have been better staffed for a holiday weekend.  We arrived for our 2:30 movie at 2:00 pm and stood in line for 15 minutes just to get our parking validated(we had already bought our tickets online) because they only had one person working the ticket desk. The line for persons buying tickets or just to get parking validated was out the door.  Note: this is a common occurrence when I've been other times. Finally got into the theater and pushed the service button to place an order.  There were only about 10 people in the theater at the time and we waited another 20 minutes just for someone to come take our order.  When the server did come to take our order we were told there were only 2 servers for all 5 theaters that day.  What manager thought that was a good idea?!  Placed our order for food and drinks and didn't receive our food  until the movie was half over and it was cold.  Got our food and no drinks.  Had to press the service button again to ask where our drinks were.  Got our drinks after we were pretty much done eating.  Movie ends and we have not received our check.  Walk out to the front of the theater to ask for the check and see trays of food sitting at the entrance to the theater which others had ordered and not gotten during the movie.  RIDICULOUS!!!!! There are vast improvements that can be made at this establishment.  Oh and don't bother complaining on their website. You will just get a generic email from their corporate office stating someone will contact you and you'll never hear another word from them.",

Other than that, its a cool experience",

Also, I ordered the Coconut Sliders, which I didn't know were fried and the buns were a little bit big for a lady to eat at the movie theater ;) but they were tasty and the fries were good too! It was definitely different than a typical theater because of all the commotion between the 5-7 servers throughout the whole movie, but I think it's just something to get used to. I hope they do more groupons, and I will go again!",

    "text": "I had such high hopes for SMG.  Thank god for $5 groupons.  So I picked my seat online and sat down before the movie started.  I didn't want any food just a beer.  So i ordered a Rebel IPA ( what no local oferrrings?) It took around 35-40 minutes before I said I can't wait any longer and pushed the button again.  Voila, i see my beer coming up the staircase. THe server hands it to me and says sorry.  Either my beer was left out due to them forgetting about me or they confused their cooler with an incubator.  Fortunately for me I don't mind warm beer.  No big woop.  I was a little parched so i slammed this bad boy.  Hesitantly i pushed the red button again.  This time the supervisor/manager came up.  He asked me what I would I like.  I pointed to the beer and put it in his tablet.  Then he asked if I am sure I ordered that beer. I stated yes.  Then he sat down next time shined a lite on me, then my beer.  Then me then my beer, before he stated that I must have switched seats. I explained I had not moved.  He continued to shine the light on me and have his table out.  The people next to me were getting quite pissed.  This went on for atleast 5 minutes which seemed like an eternity since i was destroying other people's viewing experience.  FInally he found out they gave me the first beer free for making me wait that long.  I could have really done without the accusation of \"moving my chair\" and the fact that he turned my seat into a spotlight.  The next beer came up quick.  Drank it, the movie finished, and I recieved my check.  Suprisingly the first beer was added back on!  I love the concept of this place.  Food, dinner movie, and being able to pick your seat online. Though until they get their shit together I will not be back.",

    "text": "SMG use to be great, not so anymore, far from it in fact.    - They've replaced the large and comfortable cloth seats with smaller faux leather versions which only serve to make you hot. - I was with 4 other people recently; one guy never received his food, and one of the couples with us never received their water. - There is a bar/club downstairs and while the music has never been an issue in the past, now it's utterly horrible. Loud bass bleeds through the walls and will disrupt the entire theater if you're there for a night time viewing. - You pick your seats ahead of time when ordering online, this has always been a boon in the past since I usually go with multiple other people, we can ensure we all sit together. The problem? Well, the floor plan/chart used online to pick your seats rarely (if ever) matches up with the actual theater layout... The problem here is most evident when you sit on the back row, since a wall may or may not divide your group in half... Contrary to picking seats next to each other online. - The waiters and waitresses seem to have no idea where the correctly numbered seats are anymore, this may have something to do with the new seat redesigned mentioned above, but it's pretty annoying to get interrupted/asked multiple times throughout the movie if \"you're in seat 13?\"... NO! IM IN SEAT 11! SHOULD YOU NOT ALREADY KNOW THIS???  There are a few more things I could mention here, but you get the idea.",

To start my chair was not secured to the floor so within the first five minutes of the movie I leaned back only to have my cup of ice water fall all over me and soak my seat. I then asked for a new cup of water and waited about 45 minutes until it arrived. My friend and I decided to split the duo dip, they came out on time but weren't super tasty. We then ordered the grilled chicken tenders with the sauces of our choice. The chicken tenders came, the sauces did not. We asked if we could have the sauces and were told that they would be right out. So we waited and we waited... The chicken got cold and the sauces never came. I then ordered a vanilla milkshake only to be told they were out of vanilla ice cream. Finally when the check came we charged for the sauces that were never delivered, we requested that they be taken off.... They weren't. Around the same time we could hear music blaring through the walls from the bar next door... Not ideal for the ending scenes of the movie. All in all it was kind of horrible but Amy Schumers movie was still quite enjoyable.",

An hour past before our beer came and the food never did. Two hours into the movie and no sign of the server. I figured somebody would have came and gave us an explanation of their terrible service. There wasn't a peep from anybody. I had to go to the ticket check booth and tell them to cancel our order. This place isn't even worthy of 1 star. They need to get it together. The staff could care less that our food never came. It was almost like they have been through the song and dance so much that they were numb to it. This place sucks!!!!",

    "text": "NOT GO!!!! I had the WORST experience ever in my life at the EpiCenter SMG. Where do I begin!?! My boyfriend and I get there and the service was awful. She directed us to the wrong movie! Once we finally went to the right one, we sit down and we were given an \"alternate menu\" because of the CIAA weekend. I ask the manager if they were still doing the 2 for $25 for the movie goers and he told me no. I looked all over for a disclaimer or a heads up of the change in menu-my ticket, Instagram, twitter.. Nowhere to be found!! If I had known there was going to be an alternate menu, I wouldn't have come to SMG at that time.   At first we ordered pretzel bites, chicken tenders, and two sweet teas. The food came out (always to the couple next to us.. and they always asked if we \"switched seats;\" as if they didn't know the seat numbers, or something was wrong with their system) and I would describe it as overrated and over priced, but the food came out in a timely manner. We watched others get their orders taken and they got their food and drinks. My boyfriend asked 3 servers, who, were LESS THAN helpful AND pleasant, and we waited at least 40-45 minutes for our sweet teas. By the way, my personal service button was broken, but I digress. The excuse that they gave us was that they were slammed because of the club section in the building. I was not convinced not 1% because I worked in the service industry for years and soft beverages like sweet teas and and sodas are the EASIEST and FASTEST things to give to a customer. We get the sweet teas and they were awful!   The movie was way too loud (I'm assuming to cover up the club noise). During the movie I saw servers on the side hanging out (this was when we still didn't have our drinks). At the end, the server showed no courtesy when she collected and dropped off the tickets at the worst possible moments of the movie. All in all our experience was DREADFUL! At this time and based on this experience, my boyfriend and I see no reason to come back and recommend this establishment to any of our friends and co-workers.   We contacted Guest Services and although her response was quick, she gave the worst response no upset customer should hear. She basically said sorry and we will improve our processes. Nothing more. DO NOT GO!",

As soon as I walked in the theater I noticed how dirty the place was. The bathrooms were horrible! Trash all in the seats and floor  from the previous movie and the drink trays were just disgusting. All four of the seats I paid for were like this. I paid for the 4:30p movies and got there early so we could order our food as the website instructs you. Then 6:00 came around I had some upset children and no food. I was one of the first ones in the theater and I noticed everyone had their food and I didn't have mine. We were more than half way into the movie. No one noticed my service light so I walked out and found my server. I asked about my food and the young lady forgot to key it in. Instead of her apologizing for it she asked if I still wanted it. Of course I do! My kids are hungry that's why we came for movie and dinner! She brought out my sliders in 5 minutes and they were hard as a rock and cold. I said no onions and they were all on them. I took them back because that's not what I ordered. The girl had an attitude and still no apology so she got the manager. He told me he would fix it. The last 30 minutes into the movie I received my entire order. Well my pizza came the last 10 minutes smh. Then they hand me a bill and I should have known something was wrong when they handed me an extra drink that I told her I didn't want and not to order so I paid an extra $4 for a soda I didn't drink. When you providing that type of service I should have gotten an apology or something. This place is the worst. The other reviews were right. They need to re-evaluate their entire ordering system because it's terrible. And replace the staff. They don't have the right attitude for this job. They were very rude and I'm not the only one who was complaining.  Yes you're going to get a lot of upset people. When you're paying for a service and you don't receive it then expect the Problems that come with it.",

That's is the whole purpose of keeping the call button on so they know you need service.  I asked for a cup of water. I never got it. I was told to turn my button off it was so dark in there.  I could not see which server was supposed to serve me. The good thing I like about attending here is they validate parking for 4 hrs to give you a chance to eat if you want to eat somewhere else beside inside the movie grill.

Pros:  -If you want to see the hot new movie on opening weekend, you can buy tickets ahead of time online... and even pick out your seats. Saves you all that hassle of going to a theater early and waiting. -SMG validates parking. This is HUGE because that Epicentre deck is ridiculous. The validation is good for up to four hours. -The seats are super comfy. It's like being on a couch. -The service was great. There was an army of servers manning our theater. Which leads me to the cons...  Cons: -There's an army of servers roaming around the theater. Talk about distraction dot com. -They keep a light on in the theater.  -It's not quiet. The booming bass from Kazba next door plus all the noise from people eating, ordering food, servers moving around... it's a lot. -Alcohol served in a theater. There will be at least one drunk person in your movie. In my case, it was the couple next to me... hammered. And all over each other. No, they were not teenagers... they were like 40.  There are certain times when it makes complete sense to come here. But if you're straight up just wanting to really enjoy a movie... I would recommend going somewhere else.",

This place was very very very unprofessional and lacked any good sense of how to provide quality customer service along with lacking how to deal with unhappy customers.  On March 17, 2017, I went to the SMG at the Epicenter to inquire about the movie, Beauty and the Beast, after hearing that there were some controversy over the movie through social media from some parents that had seen the movie stating that they were very upset with Disney and disappointed with the movie because there were reports of homosexually scenes in the movie they felt were a bit too much for a Disney movie.  After learning about the controversy, I wasn't sure if the movie was appropriate enough to bring my kids, ages 8 & 7 to see, because of course I haven't seen the movie.  Instead of taking a chance and just seeing the movie with my kids, being the responsible parent that I am, I thought that I would inquire about the movie first with someone that worked at the movie theater thinking that they may have some insight on what to expect from the movie due to all of the hype in order to make a sound decision.    When I walked into the establishment, I saw two employees, a male & a female standing behind the counter.  The female was helping a customer to the left of me leaving the male employee open for business as he stood there looking outside of the doors doing nothing.  When I walked up to him, I greeted him by saying hello without a response back, and asked about the movie.  I expressed my concern about what was said on social media in reference to the movie, and politely asked if the movie was appropriate for a 7 & 8 year old due to my concern.  With a stoic look on his face, he responded to me saying, \"It's a PG movie\".  Not feeling satisfied with his answer or that my question was being answered, I asked the question again, but in another way providing more detail of why I was concerned about movie informing him of reports of possible inappropriate scenes of homosexuality in the movie that was inappropriate.    Sometimes, people can misinterpret or get it wrong about what is being said or seen, and I needed that confirmation.  His response was the same repeating that the movie was a PG movie, however, this time, he said it with attitude, and responded by saying, \"So what\", when I informed him about my concern over the homosexuality scenes.  Feeling the tension, I shifted to the female employee who was done with helping the customer she was helping when I first walked in, and she asked me what was the question that I had asked the male employee that needed answering to see if she could help.  I repeated to her what I had asked the male employee, and she replied saying, \"Oh, he is gay, and was probably offended\".  I responded to her stating that I didn't care about his sexual orientation, and told her that what I was asking was a question that any responsible and reasonable parent would inquire about when it's concerning their kids regardless of whatever issue was being reported.    I was a concerned parent with a reasonable question that deserved a reasonable answer without being treated less than or feeling that they were making me feel like a bigot for having a concern or for asking a question.  Clearly these two individuals didn't have any kids, and couldn't understand where I was coming from, but let's continue there's more.  The female ended up answering my question stating that they leave decisions whether to see a movie or not up to the parent, however, the movie is a PG (Parental Guidance) movie, and that they haven't seen the movie in order to comment.  I then asked the female a rhetorical question asking how come her co-worker couldn't just state the same thing she just stated without giving me attitude, and being unprofessional by being rude with his comments because he was into his feelings.  There wasn't any management on staff at the time to complain to; therefore, on that following Monday, I met with management of that SMG location after being redirected by the Corp Headquarters for the SMG in Dallas, Texas back to the management in Charlotte after attempting to file a complaint.    The manager was less than helpful, and at first appeared to be concerned, but gave me the typical response that is given to an unhappy customer that would make a person feel like nothing was going be done stating, \"I'm sorry that happened to you, and I going to look into it\".  I asked for a follow up, and was told that they don't do follow ups, that I have to trust that they will take care of the issue, leaving me in limbo of whether something was actually going to be done.  I attempted to call the Corp Office again, but of course I got voicemail to their HR (Human Resources) Department after asking for the proper procedure for filing a complaint, and I was told that all complaints are made through their HR.  Still to this day, I haven't received a phone call.",

We were still charged for food and refused to pay. The manager called 3 security officers and 2 police officers!! The officers FORCED us to pay for our beverages. I WAS EMBARRASSED, and MORTIFIED!!! Not to mention I had to explain the situation to the officers while standing on one leg and crutches!!!",

    "text": "Since I basically can't go to a movie anymore where alcohol isn't available - we ventured to SMG last weekend. [Yes I have a problem.]  They are/were running a groupon for a 5 buck movie ticket- can't beat that even at a matinee. We were worried they might not honor the groupon after a free movie voucher fiasco we had a while back, so we paid the extra buck fifty and booked our tickets online.  They validate parking in the epicenter garage for 4 hours- but don't pay the attendant when you pull in, make sure you get a ticket so they can validate it!  When you get your tickets you get to pick your seats, so that's a plus - no one begging you after the movie has started to move over so their party of 18 can sit together ugh.  I think their seats are the best around...even though they've let the cup holders get a little murky.   We had a couple beers and split a quesadilla, the food is meh - but I have pretty mediocre hopes for movie theater food.   I think the set up here is pretty distracting, you tell your server your order - instead of writing it down like they do at cinebarre. They also have about a million people coming in and out during the movie - I know the theaters are a lot bigger so they need more people, but it's super distracting!  Our waitress was very friendly - but every other person we interacted with had a major attitude! From the front desk, to bartender, to hostess. Management needs to work on that.  Overall, I will stick to regal ballantyne or cinbarre. I would go again for 5 bucks, but that's probably the only reason I'd pick SMG in the future.",

Entrees came out with no drinks, no ranch, and no popcorn but did come out with the shake (which was too early)  Server didn't seem concerned or very interested with looking into missing items (but they weren't the same server that took the order)  15 minutes passed no drinks (which makes it hard to eat and food was getting cold)  I walked out of movie to speak w someone...  5 min later drinks came- still missing popcorn   5 min later popcorn came...(this is approx 1/2 way through the movie even though order was placed 10-15 min before movie started)  5 min after that more popcorn came that wasn't ours or that was double ordered...  When I was done w meal ranch came.   At one time I heard people behind me say \"that's not ours\" to something else.   All in all I would say 4 different people brought stuff to us instead of our original waitor.   Very disorganized and choppy.  I think I got some things taken off the bill but i still don't get how after I spoke with management the drinks and food and ranch STILL were so choppy.   This was supposed to be a fun new experience for my dad on Father's Day and I traveled from Winston Salem to do it. He liked it but it could have been much more enjoyable with better service.   I think the team needs to perform retraining and evaluate measurements of success for sustaining better customer service and overal customer experience.   On a positive note the staff that helps you check in at the lobby for movie tickets went above and beyond to explain the kiosk and were super sweet.",

    "text": "So good and so bad at the same time.  THE GOOD:  You can reserve your exact seats in advance. I love this because i hate having to worry that I won't get good seats and having to show up early to make sure I get them.  You can order drinks or food right at your seat. I think this is both good and bad, actually because I was on a diet and could not eat anything - but I had to smell not just popcorn but now hamburgers, wings, fries etc. Not the best experience when you are trying not to eat unhealthy stuff or when you just don't feel like smelling food.  The seats are very comfortable and larger than regular seats.  THE BAD:  This theater has seen better days - the shine and polish are gone.  Having servers moving around during the movie is a little distracting. I am a movie fanatic and I hate anything disrupting my state of suspended disbelief.  Unless you are going to the EpiCentre for something else or walking there (which I did) parking is a little bit of a pain.",

    "text": "I've been to other movie theaters that serve dinner but this place really doesn't know how to properly execute this. We went last night to watch Star Wars. We arrived early to ensure we can order food prior to the movie starting but no... we didn't see any waiters until the movie started. A good 1/2 hour into the movie and people all around us are ordering food. We couldn't pay attention to the movie.   When our waitress finally arrives, she informs us that there was a kitchen fire the previous night, and most of their food cannot be ordered. Really? Why am I just hearing of this? A great leadership team would have ensured that all employees communicated this information to customers. I went through two employees before reaching our waitress. We order hamburgers instead, since the oven was lost to a kitchen fire but no.... They were also sold out of buns.  I order a drink to only be told I must choose another one. All around me waiters and waitresses are apologizing. Why would any management team put their employees through that? Complete morale killer for the staff.    Just when I though things couldn't get any worse... here comes out the food. My husband and I ordered the coconut chicken tenders. Mine had the Thai chilli sauce and his had the honey mustard. My husband asked the runner which sauce was this? She didn't know. She then became irate and threw the food down, told us she wasn't the cook and continued to walk away. The rudeness! Her running partner saw what happened and immediately apologized. He then took the food away and placed it in another section. It wasn't our food to begin with but miss attitude walked away before she could determine that.   Food finally arrives! Our $11 chicken was over fried, almost black and very hard. The $10 nachos were piled high with so many ingredients you could not see the nachos, making it very hard to use your hands. My $9 Pineapple Crush tasted horrible and watered down. My daughter was the only one who scored a great tasting Cesar salad.    If anyone rates this place with more than 2 stars they clearly have never been to a theater that is top notch in their game. Clearly they need a new management team.",

    "text": "I will only come here for the $5 Groupon movie deal and nothing more! The service here is H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E! Servers will take down your order but never seem to come back with your food. No one wants to pay for cold food only to receive it near the end of the movie. Came here 4 times and it was never packed to where there were large food orders getting sent in so just make sure you eat before you come. If you decide to order food, MAKE SURE your receipt is correct before leaving. One time my boyfriend paid with his debit card and gave 0 tip. Few days later when he checked his bank account, he noticed tip was added to it. He kept the receipt that had the horizontal line drawn across the tip section yet the server still decided to give themselves tip. What a shame. Make sure this doesn't happen to you! Also, MAKE SURE you get your change back if you decide to pay cash. We went there yesterday and decided to give this place one last try. There were about 7 couples in the theater and we were the 3rd couple to put in our order during the previews. Who knew we'd be the last couple to get our food with only 30 mins left of the movie. They must have forgotten about our food because our food was cold when we got it. This time around, we decided to pay cash. My boyfriend gave $40 to pay for our $31 meal. He expected $9 change back because, clearly, service still sucked but the server decided to keep it. After the movie, we went to the servers' station and had to ask for our change. Why would we tip $9 to someone who forgot about our food??? Apparently we weren't the only ones having problems that night. While we were waiting, there were other people waiting to get their receipts adjusted because random charges were added and wrong orders got charged. Smh. It's unfortunate that the management isn't doing much to resolve the issues.",

    "text": "So SMG was just \"okay\" to me. The food selection is great but quality I wasn't too impressed with. You should be sure to check the menu in the bar and decide on something before going in and settling down to watch your movie. The light available in the theater is not enough to even read the menu. Likewise, it's not enough to see the food your eating very well or to sign a check and write in a tip.  The negatives above aside, the seats are the best available in the theater world. Something akin to a La-Z-Boy recliner with a swivel table and drink holders big enough to hold your liter-o'-cola. Assigned seating is also great because it ensures you don't need to line up and fight tooth and nail to claim the best seat in the house. Service was excellent too. I can't think of why, but the server we had was cheerful and ever ready to do her job of risking her life up and down stairs in the darkness to bring us our lukewarm meals and room temperature soggy sweet potato fries.  The movie quality and lighting in the theater is perfect, as expected. But the one thing that enhanced my experience (and mind you plays no role whatsoever in the quality of my review) was the intensely rude guy behind me. Well, I honestly found him hilarious but in that \"are you serious!?\" kinda way. He spent the whole movie burping, farting, munching audibly and kicking my chair continuously. Your mom let you go out in public? Hahaha!",

    "text": "I never came here very often before because it's not that close to where I live, but when MoviePass started severely limiting movie selection at non-eticketing theaters, we started coming way more often. This is the only e-ticketing theater for MoviePass in Charlotte, so it's your only choice if you don't want to be limited in movie selection.   One really nice thing about this theater is that they validate parking for up to 4 hours in the Epicenter parking garage. Check in is easy at the kiosks -- you can just scan your phone to print the ticket if you purchased online.   One thing I don't like much about this theater is the seats. They don't recline and they aren't that comfortable. The tray for the food is also really annoying if you aren't eating (couldn't they have them fold down?). The worst part is how loud this theater gets because of the ability to order food during the movie. The servers are constantly walking back and forth and talking to people ordering. It's really distracting from being able to watch the movie.   The only reason I would recommend this theater is if you have a MoviePass. Otherwise, you're better off at another theater.",

We did not order food this time, but my friends did. The prices are pretty high, but it's a convenience that I'd be willing to pay for to watch my movie and eat a meal or snack.   It's nice that there is a full bar there - if you're really making a night out of it!

Feel like you're life is perfectly balanced and you really miss agonizing frustration? Well my friends, do the following, order your food and...wait for it...order an adult beverage. Now if your with your spouse, make a bet on ohh I don't know a foot rub on how long you think that adult beverage shall take and closest without going over will win the foot rub. Now start a timer discretely.. I promise you'll be surprised! . Next comes the food and you can feel your spirits lift, maybe those crazy yelpers are just the negative nancies of Amazon reviews...this isn't THAT bad. Maybe... Now eat the fries, pretty salty right? Limped out cold salty fries..YUM! As you proceed to eat your meal you may feel a little parched, maybe the over cooked burger lacked any remnants of grease making it a chewy saliva-less engagement . You'll then ask, hmm wonder where that beer is? Now the game is a foot! Maybe just pausing this culinary delight for a few minutes for the beverage to arrive will fix it. But wait, wouldn't my food get cold? You wouldn't be wrong. This moment is where you will feel that familiar old friend frustration arrive.  Glance to your right on the table and see that red button? Welcome to the second game, see how long you can go before you can press that button. Like pavlov himself you will get to know this button well. Finally as your wait staff approaches kindly ask for the beverage. You might get a response with mumbles, might get what we call the drive by button pusher that comes over \"clears the button\" Knods and then sprints off like Tyson Gay at a track meet (thanks google) leaving you to wonder \"Did we ever even exchange words?  Yes my friends, you will meet them all during a 3 hour movie. You two hour folks, I can't even begin to imagine. So then you say, wait, there was a fairly vacant bar area next to my theater! Solved! I'll just by a drink there! Yes you can and you will also enjoy the Prime BLT / Ritz like pricing of these drinks! Saunter back to your seat and continue to see how long the mythical original drink takes.  After all of that you might order the popcorn later after everyone else has succumbed to the atrophic dining experience. Remember, for proper research. Your mind goes through the process of popcorn. Ok! It'll be popped and ready for patrons so it couldn't possibly be that long and hey the initial meal must of been the reason for all the delays. Hahaha this is where your frustration will be full steam as you realize it could be a candy bar and you might (or might not) ever receive your ordered item. For the next hour you will go to your handy dandy button and then back to the multiple staff visits with no results and you will conclude your experiment confirming that Yelp reports can be accurate and some places are just bad. Shout out to one waiter though, man you deserve better my friend and your a True hero as you were my fourth staff visit that reacquainted with my long lost adult beverage at 1 hour and 15 minutes but you were really trying and by the second item that became lost only to be resolved by yourself as visit #3 on that item I felt we had a connection like two soldiers on the front line sharing a traumatic never to be experienced again connection. I salute you soldier!",

This is usually my first pick since it's right off the light rail and I can take it from my house. They also validate parking in case you opt to drive which is a huge deal. They always have the latest movies and a great variation of screening times. There's a full service bar at the theater as well which is nice if you're early for a movie. The are a few cons about this place that I can no longer ignore however. I've been going to SMG for about 4 years now and I've felt that with every visit the food service has declined. On my most recent visit, my family and I opted to not order dinner since it wasn't as good on our previous visit. We were some of the first to be seated and ordered some popcorn, water, and a frozen hot chocolate. The server that took our order didn't seem enthusiastic to help us and it almost felt as if we were bothering her. The popcorn and water came in a timely manner but we had to request the frozen hot chocolate twice before it finally came out 40 minutes later. They asked that we paid for the food at time of order, which wasn't a big deal but then towards the end of the movie another server approached us claiming we hadn't paid yet and asked us to pay again. There was a little back and forth conversation before he was finally able to validate that we had indeed already paid. This took away from us being able to focus on the movie. I love SMG because of its convenience but if I'm no longer taking advantage of the food service than I may consider finding another movie theater to frequent. I'll likely go once more for a final opinion and update this review afterwards.",

When we got inside the theater, it was super easy to get confirmed with our MoviePass tickets, and we headed upstairs to the theaters.  We weren't exactly sure where to go to get popcorn or drinks, but we passed a bar heading to the theaters and thought THAT was pretty cool. Who wouldn't want to get a little sloshed before seeing a movie?  After showing our ticket to the appropriate person, we were given a menu and directed to the correct theater. I didn't even know that SMG was one of those theaters that let you order food and drinks and stuff so THAT was a surprise.   They had a pretty good deal going of an appetizer and 2 entrees for $25 so my girlfriend and I did that. We got the pretzels with the queso - delicious - and both got the chicken tenders and fries. I was expecting a big ole plate of MEH on the tenders and fries but I thought both were actually really good.  I'm not exactly sure what other experiences other patrons have had, but I thought the serving staff did a good job of not making noise, not being distracting, and not getting in the way during the movie when fielding requests, getting drinks and food, and cleaning up the occasional broken glass.  All in all, I thought this was a really fun experience and definitely a nice change of pace for my movie-going experience. It had the \"fun night out\" vibe to it. I don't think I'll want to come here every time I go see a movie just because it's sort of a process, but we'll definitely be back sometime soon!",

    "text": "As much as I want to give them a 2 or 3 for the concept, some of the good food, or the fact that they validate parking in the expensive Epicentre parking lot I just can't. I've been here on numerous occasions and every time its something. On my last visit, it was me and 9 of my friends. The first thing we noticed was that the theater was dirty! We were trying to find seats together of course (it was an advance screening so not assigned beforehand) and when I say every other seat was just about filthy with spills, trash and crumbles all on the chairs, trays, and floors. Luckily we did find two decent rows and were able to wave down a server to clean the mess that was there. Once seated we all ordered and half the food came out cold, not lukewarm but cold. One ordered tenders and fries, her tenders were right out the fryer hot and the fries might as well came out of the freezer they were so cold.  One of my go to items here are the chicken nachos so a few ordered that and every single one came out cold, with one order not coming out until the middle of the movie and we all ordered at the same time. I ordered the buffalo chicken flatbread which is really good and it did come out hot. The servers were all over the place and it was always a new one that had an attitude when there was an issue. They are also kind of a distraction all throughout the movie and you could tell that there were a lot of issues all throughout the theatre and not just with my group. And their go to excuse is that the kitchen is backed up but that can't be the case every single time and if it is then they need more staff or a better system.  Another issue is the check process, maybe they need to confirm everything is correct before bringing the checks because there was a long line after the movie with all the people trying to get their checks fixed, a few of my friends included.",

Eventually got my order by the end of the movie from the only nice guy who works there (when I asked for the 3rd time) - clearly they forgot about my order but were too lazy to check when I asked before.

They still served food while the issue was obviously not fixed too. I feel sorry for the staff tonight. They had no answers except one. Turn your 3D glasses upside down.

They need a good, thorough cleaning. The tables attached to our seats were not clean, and neither was the button you press to order your food. In fact we had to press the button several times before anyone showed up. I never remember having to do that in the past. I ordered a margarita pizza like I've done in the past. It wasn't nearly as good. My husband's sandwich and fries were good, he said, if not a little bland (the sandwich). I'd have been mad if we didn't have a groupon.  We probably won't return here because far too many theatres have been upgraded and rival this one. The whole food delivery option is nice, and they do manage to do a good job not disrupting the movie and handling the transaction well, but the food is sub-par now. So I'd rather just grab a bite ahead of time and go to a nearby theater in the future.",

    "text": "My wife and I are really big movie fans. We love movies and love going out to eat. So when we find a theater that gives us the opportunity to do both -- we're all in. But this particular venue falls short in both the dining and theater experience.  We've had great watch/dine experiences at iPic theaters and even some AMC theaters. So when we learned Studio Movie Grill offered the same kind of experience, we were excited. Unfortunately, that's not the level of experience here.  Here is what we experienced:  The venue is more of a bar / club. People can come and go to get drinks without needing to purchase a movie ticket. So you have people wandering the building.   If indeed it is a bar, I wonder what the rules are because there are younger looking people (possibly teenagers) in the same bar area with adults.  The venue is almost always dirty. There's no one wiping the floors or picking up trash. The staff seems to take a very long time cleaning the theater between showings. So people are standing in line minutes before the movie begins -- which means they have to order quickly before the film starts.  The food is overpriced for the quality. Though it does come out relatively quick.  Because the venue draws/attracts a bar crowd, you would think there'd be more security...but nah! No one checks anything which isn't safe. There's probably someone in the building but the 2 times I've been here, I've never seen any officer or guard. In fact, I saw a kid come in through a side door and just walk into a theater. If he worked there, you couldn't tell.   The bottom line: this movie/dining experience pales in comparison to others like iPic that you may find in other cities. But I believe that there's no urgency to improve the quality because it's the only place of its kind in the are.   I really hope they get it together. It CAN be better (maybe under new management). But as for now, you're better off eating somewhere else before going to a regular theater.",

First when we ordered our food it took almost half the movie for it to come out then we only received half of the order. When we asked about the other part of our order they said that \"since the upstairs turns into a night club the bartenders were backed up\" and so was the kitchen staff. Needless to day half of the theater had their red lights on wanting to speak to the manager because nobody really received their orders and then on top of that most people had already paid for their food and drinks but nobody received so half of the theater ended up waiting for the manager to remove the things they did not receive off their tab.   Not to mention the staff was horrible when we asked about our order they did not give answers they only said that it was not their job and that the manager would have to assist and that we would have to find her after the movie.   In the past I have had great experiences at SMG however this new young staff they have SUCKS!!   Management was great and did not argue when it was time to remove the things we did not receive.",

It's located in the epicentre and the interior is pretty cool. They have a full service bar you can hang out at with couches while you wait for your theater to be ready. Once you're inside the theater, you get some menus and push a button on your tray table when you're ready to order.   The seats are comfy and service is decent. The food is mediocre like pub food, but they work hard and it fills you up. My favorite part was the \"adult\" milkshake I got. I could've had 5! The theaters were clean and everyone is busy eating and drinking so no one is really talking. Only thing is if there's a specific movie you want to see, get there early.

However, you wouldn't be doing yourself a disservice by waiting for it to come out on Redox.  The positive is that the staff here is classy. There were three situations that occurred while I was there that were handled in a positive way. The first is that I was late and my date was already in the theatre with my ticket. I walked up to the lady who was taking tickets and told her that he had my ticket and I was going to wait on him to come out. She said \"okay, that's fine\" and that was it. When he came out, she saw him and we walked in. She never asked for the ticket. Perhaps she remembered him coming in alone. Who knows. Regardless, I appreciated not being hassled.   The next situation, my date's credit card was rejected. That could be embarrassing huh? Instead of making a scene, the attendant apologized (not that it was his fault) for the inconvenience and told him to not worry, finish watching the movie, and pay after the movie was over in the lobby. Classy! Not sure what the issue was, but he handled it.  Last issue was dealt with parking. While my date was paying for the food, I went to the bar to get my parking validated. The cashier required that I have my movie ticket present. She wasn't asking for too much, except for the fact my date had the movie ticket, not me -_-  Once he came over, it was validated in a jiffy. She was really nice about enforcing the rule without being a jerk.  While in the movies, I had the crispy chicken tenders with BBQ sauce and french fries. They were average. However, they were only $10. Considering a small popcorn and a soda are going to run you $8 at most movie theaters, real food being decently priced here is a huge positive. Studio Movie Grill is a great choice for dates. Parking validation makes coming to the Epicenter on a busy night more tolerable.",

Put in our dinner order at 8:03. We order 2 waters, 2 whisky sours,pretzel bites, chicken tenders, nachos, and sweet potato fries. 30 minutes later and the movie is playing and we still have not received anything...not even our drinks. So I buzz for help, ask the waitress about our drinks and she brings out 2 \"whisky sours\"...still no water. Whisky sours were not even mixed...literally first sip was all sour. I stop our original waiter 15 minutes later asking him where is our water and food. He looks confused and goes gets the waters...tells me to be patient for the food ( mind you we only orders apps). Now it's 1.5 hours into a 2 hour movie and still NO food. I stop another waiter to ask about the food, they went to check and never came back. 5 minutes later, a new waiter comes back to give us the bill...full bill. I inform him that I will not be paying seeing as how I haven't even eaten yet. He apologizes and comes back 5 minutes later saying the food order was just put in. They come out with our food. I could tell how quickly they put together the order seeing as  chicken was not all the way cooked and my fries were cold. We barely ate. So I didn't fuss thinking they obviously were not going to charge us. 5 minutes later the guy comes back and gives us the check. My brother at this point is pissed, goes and gives him back the bill and says he will not be paying for such poor service. They still charged us for two drinks and we left. WORSE EXPERIENCE EVER. Just go to a normal cinema, this was a waste of time.",

I got my tab for both items that I asked for. The waitress then came back to tell me she had taken one of the items off my tab without me asking her to and said the cash I had placed in the holder to pay the original amount was gone. When my order was brought to me they didn't walk up to my seat they kept walking behind my seat and tapping me to give it to me. Overall this was not a good experience.",

The food is terrible and not worth your money. My sliders came out cold and tasted awful. Also, no soda or beer on tap because who the hell knows.  I ordered a bottled beer and got the wrong order twice. The server also forgot to bring out items we did order, and then charged us for them.

If you like people who talk the WHOLE movie and staff that walks around the whole time on their iPhones taking orders, then you've arrived at your favorite movie theatre...  This was the worst experience ever. They messed up OUR seat reservations and then asked OUR party of 6 to move. The issue was with one of the staff members, Bianca, who gave very False information about our seats. (It created a HUGE issue.) Then the manager proceeded to inform us that we needed to move because another group had reserved the seats we ALREADY reserved. But he made it clear his staff member Bianca would be getting in big trouble for the mistake.. Who cares?? I want the seats I paid for. Not some big scene with outside people getting involved and making matters worse. The manager came back and gave free movie passes to our group... No thanks. That won't be necessary. I will never ever go back to this place.   So again, if you like to enjoy a movie out where it's quiet and peaceful then DONT GO HERE!! You will regret it the second you go up the escalator to get inside.",

One order was wrong twice, and it took me telling 3 different people that my daughter's pizza hadn't come out yet 40 minutes into the movie. I thought restaurants brought out complete  orders. Even the idea of waiting 25 minutes for water is absurd. Please have a team meeting and determine what is or isn't working for this place.",

I wasn't aware they offered a full bar and pool tables or I would've dropped by even earlier to hang before my movie. The staff was extremely nice and informative, as I had to ask how things worked. The food was surprisingly delicious and the service was just as wonderful. My only complaint is that I had no idea where I was supposed to go upon entering. So, I did end up wandering around a bit, but in the end it all worked out.   I'm honestly not sure why some people complain about the service. I think given the number of people they have to serve in such a short window, they did an incredible job. Like I said, everyone was very friendly and my service was prompt and accommodating.

I sent it back and ordered a chicken quesadilla as I had had one score and was good a few years ago but it took another 45 mins to get it after ordering and it was also cold and dried out with hard calf chicken ! They told me that were not going to charge me but I just checked my back account and they charged me $21.38 for nasty drink and nasty food ! I called to complain and left a message since nobody answered the phone !! I do NOT recommend this place .

We came to SMG when Spectre first opened up and ordered our favorite Sriracha chicken flatbread because the coconut sauce that comes with it is just out of this world. Sadly, our flatbread didn't come with any this time. I was disappointed but took this experience as a learning experience, I thought I'd make sure to ask for extra sauce next time. Last night, we returned to watch a screening of The Big Short and were even further disappointed with the serving staff. I specifically asked for extra coconut sauce when ordering our food ( it was even printed on the food ticket). After receiving a mediocre chicken nachos which were extremely hard to eat in the awkward bowl it was served in, our entrees never came while everyone else was chowing down. Finally, a server came up to me to explain how they lost my original order, someone else had picked it up in the kitchen and they are expediting my order. Again, I also asked for extra coconut sauce from the server and she assured me that it will be brought. Surprise! No sauce on our dry Sriracha flatbread! I didn't even eat the flatbread, I left it to show the manager.   The GM, Chris, was already pretty swapped with getting in all the checks after the movie so I waited till everyone left. I explained the situation, Chris ended up comping our food and gave us movie passes to make up for the last couple of experiences with the kitchen. Thanks for rectifying the situation Chris, we will for sure be returning to Studio Movie Grill. I still, however, will not let up regarding the coconut sauce, I want my coconut sauce!",

I have now resorted to only coming to watch movies at this location and will never eat here again.

Despite it being a busy weekend night, only one employee was working at the ticket counter and was doing her best to manage the influx of people having problems with the self-serve booths and everyone in line. When I went to use the bathroom before the movie, the bathroom was DESTROYED - puke covering one of the toilets and toilet paper dispensers torn off the wall and laying in the floor - so I told an employee and pushed the \"needs service\" button on the bathroom wall. After the movie TWO HOURS LATER I returned to the bathroom to find it in the exact same state (puke still everywhere, nothing picked up). Before the movie started, we ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer and a pizza and burger for our main course. 45 minutes later, we still hadn't received our chips and salsa, so we asked our waitress what was going on. Her response was, \"Oh, they still haven't brought that to you?\". About 20 minutes later, we got our main courses and again asked our waitress about the appetizer that we hadn't received but had already paid for. The food tasted like it was from a gas station, and we never got our appetizer (my husband eventually just asked for popcorn instead). Unbelievably bad service and disgusting facility.",

    "text": "The concept of this place is great. And in a perfect world this would be an ideal place to catch a meal, a movie and even a wine or beer. Before i start the bad stuff, I must say, the frozen hot chocolate there is almost worth the trip in itself. Now, if you buy a Groupon, the new process does not allow you to just give the Groupon when you pay to get in, you MUST do all of it online. Doing this almost made us miss the movie and was so complicated doing on our iphones, we ended up just paying. The seats are comfortable enough and the people who work there are fine but management, well, that is another story. More than once AFTER getting there and skipping dessert at dinner before the movie so we could have it at the theater, we were advised the kitchen was closed. Hmm. No explanation but found on the net that a Studio Movie Grille in Florida had their kitchen closed due to rats. Yikes. The food is definitely hit or miss as stated in another post, and plastic utensils, straws, napkins may or may not arrive with your meal so you have to wait for the server to bring them, therefore, hot food will be cold if it is not already. The place is not very clean and not conducive to whetting your appetite. You can get your parking validated when you pay to get into the movie IF it is done correctly which is not always the case and my friend and I ended up having to pay $20 each because it was not validated properly. In summary, if you happen to hit this place on a good night, it is a good experience but management is well below expectations and I get the impression none of them since the place opened know what they are doing, so you are taking a chance. My friend got sick once after buying our tickets and after being sick in the restroom we went back and asked for a refund -- note it was probably 10 minutes later. We could not get a refund without the manager there and after way too long waiting for the manager to show up, we had to leave without the refund as my friend was desperately ill and vomiting. Doubt we will be going back.",

    "text": "I came to this movie theater on 8/15/19 for a 5pm showing. Watched a movie in theater 2. This wasn't the usual dine in theater I frequent. I was here for work and found this one, I wish I had listened to the reviews. The theater itself isn't horrible. However I have to say that this theater has a weak sound quality. Many times I felt like the actors were whispering. I'm guessing the walls must be thin if they need to keep the sound lower than most. The seats are comfortable but they do not recline which caught me off guard because dine in theater seats usually recline.   We ordered 2 margaritas, popcorn and nachos. I can confidently say that that margarita is easily the weakest margarita I have ever tasted anywhere. It tasted like it was 100%  sweet and sour mix. I've had 99 margaritas that taste stronger. $20 on two margaritas, we felt robbed. The popcorn was stale. It was a little chewy. The nachos were good. But they delivered the nachos 40 minutes after placing our order. Nachos shouldn't take 40 minutes anywhere. Some of the chips were even soggy from the cheese by the time we finally got them. There was a couple sitting behind us who were waited on before we got there and the guy had to walk out because their food was taking so long. Then I see him coming back holding their plates of food himself. He looked upset, as he should.   The servers were loud during the movie. Their station was to the left of the hallway where you enter the theater and during silent moments of the scary movie (you know when something is about to happen) we could only concentrate on how loud they were. Several people were looking around because it was really distracting and obnoxious. Working for tips, they should really be more considerate and attentive of their guests.   Studio Movie Grill is nothing to write home about. The only positive I walked out with from there was the movie itself even though the sound quality did it no justice. I'll wait for it to come out on Redbox so that I can appreciate it more at home.",

Several waiters constantly moving around, someone else's food being passed over your head, bright screens waved at your face (again with someone else's check) all while you're trying to watch a film --- who ever thought this could make for an enjoyable time? If someone wants to be waited on and served food & drink, they should go to a restaurant or a bar! Stop this madness.",

Sadly, it took almost 30mins to get to me - this was before the movie started. It was just a drink so I was a little bothered by it taking so long. I doubt I got the entire portion size too, another disappointment.  The theater was clean, facility seemed to be clean as well. I went to a 12:15 movie, before any chaos I guess. It was cute having the little tables available to hold your food if you decided to order a meal or snack. I thought this theatre had reclining seats. They didn't! That was a disappointment but I guess it goes along with the tables they had attached to the chairs.   Other than that... pretty decent experience. No other issues and the staff was pretty nice and friendly too. That's always a plus.",

They always have the newest movies and solid showtimes which is great, but the theaters are typically very loud with people pressing their buttons and communicating with the waiters.   Bar prices are high but that is to be expected and I definitely would recommend eating elsewhere before your show unless you're a big chicken tenders and ranch fan.",

    "text": "UPDATED REVIEW:  We used to come here all of the time but for the last year or so we've been going to a different theater. We decided to buy tickets for a matinee from SMG this past weekend and, well, it wasn't great.  Everyone around us ordered food and, I kid you not, every single person had a problem with their order. So throughout the entire movie, we were interrupted by employees taking food to the wrong people, customers calling for service because they were missing part of their order, a person complaining that their order was wrong, a person complaining that they didn't get silverware, etc. It was really distracting and irritating. Also, as we were leaving the theater, two employees were standing outside of the door and one was loudly complaining that her coworkers weren't doing their job like she was. Pretty unprofessional.   I dunno. This place has kinda lost its luster for me.   ************************************* PREVIOUS REVIEW:  We've been coming to this movie theater for years and consistently enjoy our experience. Now, to be totally fair I haven't tried any of the food because I've heard from other people that it's often cold and that isn't a gamble I am willing to take. We've tried various alcoholic drinks and liked them all. The validated parking is awesome. They give you enough time to enjoy some of the other places in the EpiCentre before or after the movie. I also like that we get to pick our actual seats (which is great for people like us who are often coming in right when the previews start).   I will say that there are some things I don't like about SMG. First of all, you used to be able to ride the escalator from the box office to the movie theater. You now have to go outside and go up the stairs. Not a big deal but not fun in rain and kind of irritating. The other thing is that the last time we went, we noticed the seats were different. The armrests didn't lift up and the chairs were much more firm. We both agreed that we like the old seats better. Not sure if it was just the particular movie theater room we were in or if this was a change throughout. Finally, the bathroom is often out of toilet paper, soap, etc. Luckily I keep Kleenex and hand sanitizer on hand at all times.",

Look, I feel bad for them but I also don't like waiting behind them. So, I fixed it. I utilize the app and everything is electronic.   Slow service can be problematic. I just left an 11:30am Showing of Skyscraper and honnnneeyyy I never got a follow up on the red light so I turned it off once the movie got started. Geez   Pro's: Atom, MoviePass, SMG perk club and even GroupOn can be done electronically.  Parking is free. When the system goes down you'll need the actual printed movie ticket to get through the gates for free.  * Tuesday's will get you prompt service. I mean man they roll fast with a packed crowd.   American Express has offered deals for purchases here.   It's cute.  Each visit we've had a clean restroom experience.  The neighboring businesses  AND free parking makes this a steal. But if you can't catch a spot then walk.   They are sincerely trying. I wish I could have the food and serve me at my seat with the AMC plush oversized seats. If the seats changed, I'd never leave this place.",

We got there and entered through the third floor entrance and there were no directions. We wandered around until we found the ticket booth. She told us we had to go the second floor to print out our tickets, how inconvenient. We went down the escalators and the girl smiled at us at the front. The first hint of customer service. We had to wait 15 minutes to enter our theatre. It was already 6:30 and the movie was supposed to start at 6:45PM. Online it told us to arrive 30 minutes before the movie, clearly wrong. We got to our seats with water all over the floor and on the seats. It was clearly a mess. When notifying an employee there, she called for a runner to clean it but chuckled. The staff was very unprofessional, standing around and not attending to the customers. There was only one person of staff to apologize for the situation and recommended that we could sit in temporary seats. The first sign of sympathy and concern. We eventually left because it took them so long to address the situation. At least they refunded our tickets. I didn't even see the movie. I would never recommend this place to _anyone_",

The seats were nice and comfortable but do not decline like the ones at concord mills, I guess that's the trade off for getting food brought to you. I ordered a burger and fries. The food came out pretty quickly which only adds to my confusion about why my food wasn't hot. The bun had a funny taste to it but my actual burger was pretty good, well seasoned and cooked.  The blue  margarita was better than the food. It was a little strong but a lot of delicious! I would come back here for the drinks and movie, not sure about the food.",

My husband and I got a sitter so we could sneak out and see a late showing of Spiderman. The movie was supppsed to start at 10:45. We arrived early and at 10:38 we were told to go wait in the lounge. They had not cleaned the theater from the previous showing. We were allowed in and the movie began at 11:05pm. I could understand a delay if the theater were busy, but it was a Wednesday night. We had had plenty of time in advance to decide so we were the first people to place our food & drinks order. 11:05 movie starts 11:40 I flagged down a server to ask where our order was. She said she would notify the manager and never came back. There were only about 15 customers in the theater. 12:05 I flagged down the person who took our order. I told him every other person had been served and asked where ours was. He said he'd check. He came back five minutes later handed me 2 movie passes and said the manager would speak with us after the movie. He never offered to bring us food or even our drinks. No apology. No explanation. We sat there through the end of the credits until we were the last 2 people in the theater. No manager. When we left we didn't see anyone in the hallway either. I'm beyond disappointed. What was supposed to be a little getaway was ruined. Because I'm a breastfeeding mother I need to have lots of water to drink all of the time. This was the worst experience of several that we've had over the last year. They've lost a couple of long term customers.",

We went on Wednesday, May 2nd to go see the new avengers movie at 8 P.m. And we got there right before 8, sat down and ordered our food and drinks (water, Dr. Pepper, two salads and popcorn). 10 or so minutes later a man sits down in front of us and orders his food and drinks. As well as a couple sitting behind us about the same time. Well 10+ minutes pass and he gets his drink. Then his food. Then the couple gets their drinks, and their food. Then the couple behind us get refills of their drinks. We get annoyed and ask an attendant to see about our drinks and popcorn... She says the popcorn machine was having an issue and needed to reset, still no drinks. We push the button for the server and he comes. It is well past 30-45 minutes at this point and still no drinks at all. We stop another attendant, she apologizes and actively walks out of the theater to get our drinks. Then the girl we talked to 20+ minutes before finally comes back with our drinks, then the other girl comes back with our drinks. We take them since we figure it would take an act of God to get refills when we actually want them. We finally get our salads, and have drinks, miracles do happen. Then almost halfway through the movie we finally get our popcorn, and it is only a half full SMALL bag. No apologies for the long wait or explanation of the lack of a full bag, nothing. And this is by no means the first issue we have had here. I've pretty well decided if we want to go to a movie we need to only plan on seeing a movie there, because this affects my whole movie experience. I am sitting there wondering if I will ever get my food, or drinks. And having time address this with attendants. We do not suggest this theater to other people for this reason. I actually took pictures of the receipt because I was so annoyed by the experience. The only positives were that the food was good, the seating was comfortable and the movie was great... Pretty well everything made me wish we had driven out to one of the AMC or Regel.",

When we got to the theater the worker indicated they were cleaning the theater and would make an announcement when the theater was ready. Our group was one of the first people inside the theater and we noticed that it wasn't very clean. There was sticky stuff around the cup holders. We were amongst the first people to order. We order the special we're you get appetizer and 2 entrees for $25 (Popcorn, Pizza, and coconut chicken fingers). They brought out our drinks, however, we noticed that everyone around us that had came in way later than us started to get their order fulfilled. After about an hour into the movie, I pressed the attendant button to ask about my food and he declared that it was on the way. We waited and still no food, yet he was steadily bringing other people who had order stuff after us there food! So I went to the server station at the entrance of the theater and asked where was my food, again they said it was on the way. I reminded them that we were the first to order and still haven't received at least our popcorn and it was more than an hour into the movie! They finally brought out my popcorn. Then about 15 minutes later, we were informed that the pizza machine was broken and we had to order something else! By this time I didn't want anything; but when the food finally came out it wasn't even great. When the server brought us our bill he recognized all the problems we had and credit is our bill. Thanks for that; however, I will not go back!",

Please read on as I may save you from making the $150 mistake I made.  That's right, $150.  Our tickets were $35 (me, wife, my 16 yr old student, and my 10 yr old).  Food was around  $115 with tip.    Like so many other reviewers, I say this concept is a great idea and would live up to expectations with better management of the operation.  But let's not bore you too quickly.  Here are the bullets.  - the food is simply horrible.  My niece could make better pizza in her EZ Bake oven!   - some of the food was delivered cold - the pizza and the chicken nachos.  But, who dares to complain when your food is being served in almost complete darkness.  So, I wrote a note on the bill when I paid. - the \"theater popcorn\" was mostly kernels.  I really wanted to take a picture as it was quite amusing to see how many unpopped kernels there were.  Almost like it was a joke. - the gluten free crust was cardboard I think.  Other reviewers have also complained about the regular crust.  - the seats we reserved online were incorrectly described.  We selected 2 seats with one long table with recliners on each side that had their own table. What we got were 4 recliners with individual tables. - bucket of beers (5) was $20 and were proper temp.  Best part of the food/drink experience  My suggestion for the readers if you have not gone... 1. Parking is a breeze and free. Remember to bring your ticket to get validated at SMG. 2.  Do not order the food! 3. In case you missed #2, DO NOT ORDER THE FOOD! 4. Eat before hand at one of the many restaurants in the Epicentre and let SMG pick up your parking as a part of the movie (they give you 4 hours).  5. Pick your seats online - it's worth the extra $1.50 per seat in my opinion. 6. Forget everything I said here... Go out to eat at one of your preferred restaurants and then go to Ayrseley Cinemas.  Much better use of your money and a fantastic place to see a movie.",

    "text": "OK, first of all, this is not just another theatre so one cannot expect the same feel/ambience/comfort/etc like you would get in a regular movie theatre, I mean you could in a perfect work but hey whom are we kidding.  Its a movie theatre where they also serve food ( oh I thought alcohol was part of food).  My wife and I are super fans of SMG, been going here since 2011, when we paid full prices for movie tickets and parking fees to park inside the epicenter building.  Oh now?, now we groupon and you get $5 ticket to watch movie from Monday to Friday till 5pm I guess, basically weekends groupons not accepted, and parking is free for 4 hours when you get the parking ticket validated at the movie ticket counter.  I personally see that as a steal, free parking in uptown!!! Screens are smaller in size when compared to AMC, sound effect is good enough, seats are pretty good with tiny food tables attached to each seat arm rest, but no recliners though. We always loved the food here, coconut tenders, grilled southern chicken salad, chicken bbq pizza, brownie with ice cream and cinnamon chips are some of our favorites.  Price are ok, not too cheap.  Service is hit or miss, sometimes they are super fast and 0 errors in orders but at times, they just get on your nerves.  but hey its not a regular restaurant to post regular complaints. overall, wife and I love this place and we are gonna just keep going!!!",

    "text": "The selection of good movie theaters in Charlotte's urban areas (not the suburbs that are still labeled as Charlotte) are sadly limited. Studio Movie Grill at Epicenter is probably the best of what is available. They have the best selection, offer free parking with simple validation of your parking deck ticket via a machine in the theater, which is typical for most theaters in cities but still very nice.  There are two things that I really like about this theater: 1. When you buy your ticket, you also pick your seat. This is really nice for those of us who tend to stress about getting stuck in traffic and ending up with a neck-craning seat in the front of the theater. 2. You can order food and drinks to your seat before and throughout the movie. The prices are a tiny bit marked up but it's still reasonable. Two bonuses: you can cork your wine bottles and take them home if you don't finish them and they have big healthy salads as a healthy option.  The only thing keeping this theater from getting 5 stars is the fact that I've ended up with one or more broken seats in my group of friends on multiple occasions. It's pretty annoying to be teetering on a broken seat for a few hours in a movie. And, since seats are assigned, usually switching to a different seat is not an option.  Living in Plaza Midwood, this will likely be the place we continue to go to for most of our movie outings.",

    "text": "The movie theater was spacious and the screen was big.  There's a bar inside which provided you with a variety of basic drafts and cocktails.  Compared to a lot of the other studio movie grills they have a lounge area which kind of gives you a club atmosphere.    The seats were comfortable and you get to choose tour seats before you purchase your ticket which is a plus! My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night to watch Fury and this movie had a lot of action going on but during those quiet scenes you can definitely hear the clubs around the corner since their music was blasting.  I would seriously suggest watching a movie during the day instead of the evening unless you don't mine hearing club music during your theater experience.   My only reason for a four star besides the walls being thin is because the waitor lost my boyfriend's debit card.  This is like every person's nightmare! I know it's an honest mistake but they really need to be more careful.  We were understanding and were upset but the manager and the crew working took full responsibility.  For them to continue looking and taking action to make sure they didn't misplace it meant a lot to us.  They continued to look in every station and up and down all the rows in our movie theater which gave us a little peace of mind that they did care about our service.  Overall I would recommend this place for anyone who wants a dinner and a movie but I suggest you bring cash only of you're going to order some grub.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times,  I've seen first run movies and had pretty good food.  Nice option for the dinner and a movie experience:  *Service  - Wait staff can be slow at times, but the staff is always friendly and polite.  It's great to pick your seat before the show, but every seat has a good view of screen.    *Atmosphere - The sound is clear.  They've got a full bar in the waiting area, if you'd like to get your party started before going in.  The dress is neat casual. The decor is modern and trendy with movie memorabilia.  There are a lot of couples but there are also groups of friends too.  The bathrooms are always very clean, and my understanding is that there are \"attendants\" in the men's room.  I guess dudes need special help with their bodily functions.     *Food - Everything I've had was served at optimal temperatures and was okay, not great, but they do have fairly \"exotic\" fare (for a movie theater) such as coconut chicken (which is nice).          Huge salads if you're into that. My nephew had the pizza and it looked like cardboard with cheese.  It tasted like frozen pizza.  So don't get the pizza!           Also the drinks with alcohol are quite watered down, so if you get an \"adult\" beverage stick to beer unless you want to pay for ice and food coloring.          I've never had the desserts, but the selection is considerable.          Its rather nice to eat out of real dishes and flatware while enjoying a movie.   *Cost - About average.  Unless you add alcohol,  then your tab will skyrocket!  Buy your tickets on-line for more convenience and savings (shout out to Groupon). ***Parking: They validate your parking.  So DON'T forget to bring that in or end up paying about $7-$12 for parking too.",

If you're ordering food, be prepared to wait an hour. Literally. My boyfriend and I went to smg yesterday for the opening day of avengers infinity war. We ordered before the movie started and ended up getting our food an hour and fifteen minutes later. I understand the business but it was ridiculous. I ordered red wine 3 times. They gave me 1 glass of wine and charged me for 2. A lot of people were complaining at the end of the movie so I assume they were truly very busy which is understandable. I just wish they had a better system. They went to the two rows in front of us when delivering the food delivering to the wrong people. They didn't come to our tow to deliver our food and took the food back to the kitchen. Oh well. It happens. But this was our third visit and our food was delivered an hour later. I wish I could love this place. But I really can't. Eat before you go. Drink before you go. Enjoy the movie and the nice seats.",

The seats aren't comfortable, the service is very forgetful(which I can understand) and it's not easy watching a movie with servers walking all infront of the screen. Besides that, it's a movie and it's only five dollars on Tuesday.",

My food came out ridiculously cold after waiting 20 min for it. I spoke with manager who gave me a scripted apology that lacked sincerity. He offered to remake the food...that's it.

Hostess had no menus to give...had to wait to get them back from another theater.  Placed our order and didn't receive our popcorn (given to the people in the row behind us and they didn't turn it down) until well into the movie and after our other food.  Had to speak to 3 different people to get the popcorn delivered. Order margarita flatbread, it arrived cold and under cooked. Also ordered pretzel bites and the queso was cold when it arrived. Heard the server say to another guest that the kitchen was out of flatbread and ginger beer. How do you run out of these things on a Saturday night? Also, it took forever to get our food delivered, again, how do you not have enough staff to clean the theaters and serve food? The movie was supposed to start at 7:20, the previews didn't even start until 7:30, not enough projectionists either? I keep coming back hoping that they'll do a better job, but they keep finding a way to disappoint me.",

    "text": "My boyfriend had bought the groupon deal for $5 tickets and yesterday was the last day to use them so we came uptown for dinner and a movie.  They still haven't streamlined their process yet, it took quite a bit to get our tickets because they were trying out a new scanner.  We had never seen a movie at the Epicentre Theater before it changed hands because it was so crazy expensive but I think Studio Movie Grill has the right idea, everything is mid-range in price.  $10 is average for a movie & the food and drinks are pretty average priced too and if you remember to get your ticket validated parking is free.    Tuesdays are also half price tickets for ladies ($5) but when every single movie is either a war movie, sports movie or a dumb spoof scary movie, you won't be getting many ladies to attend.  That is my biggest complaint, the lack of diversity in the movies.  It seems they're catering more to the single 20 something bank worker.  We settled on 42 because it looked interesting, otherwise I would have let the groupon expire.    Be careful of where you put your elbows on your arm rest/food tray, as Tim and quite a few people around us kept accidentally hitting it with their elbows.  Service was pretty quick although you could tell there were some trainees, food was getting delivered to the wrong chair pretty consistently, but it has to be hard to deliver food in the dark!    The food was average, a step above fast food.   The chicken tenders looked nothing like what they kept showing on the screen and despite the fries being listed as seasoned, there was no seasoning or salt on them and since we were all the way at the top of the theater I didn't want to make one of the servers walk all the way up there just for salt.  I also would have liked more variety of candy.    I definitely want to come back when they do one off movies, they have quite a few $1 movie nights and they're showing some more artsy independent films too but I think I'll eat somewhere else beforehand.",

    "text": "This is a great place for a date!  My boyfriend took me here on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  We rode the light rail and got off at the EpiCentre stop and walked right up to the theater.  (Very short walk and almost all of it is covered-very helpful if you don't want to be rained on and forgot your umbrella like we did.)  The entryway of the theater is really nice, great lighting and the smell is very nice too.  You purchase or show your tickets to the desk at the entryway and then take the escalator up to the second floor.  We sat at the bar for about a half hour before our movie-the girl behind the bar was so sweet and gave us plenty attention.  The ordering process is straightforward.  You have a small red button on a small table attached to your chair.  (Kind of like a college lecture hall desk.)  You pick what you want on the menu, push the service button and a server appears.  They quickly input your order using an iPod touch and your food arrives shortly.  The food was good-I did a rather easy meal of sweet potato fries and chicken tenders.  Beware of the drink holders-yes, there are drink holders.  They are on the front left side of your table.  It is a bit awkward.  Also, there isn't a ton of room if you have to get up and leave the theater while you have food on your table, so be careful.  The movie we went to see was really upsetting so we left the theater before we were able to pay for our food.  I went to the bar outside and ordered a drink while my boyfriend stayed behind to see about paying for our food.  He explained why we left the theater and they gave him a few $5.00 movie passes.  We spend the rest of the afternoon at the bar!  I'm really looking forward to going back and actually staying for the entire movie.  :)",

    "text": "Oh Studio Movie Grille. How I wanted to love you. So let me tell you a story about a magical place called EpiCentre Theaters. It opened in (I think) 2009 and changed everything. It was different from any other theater I'd ever heard of. Sure you could have food inside the movie, drinks even. But you purchased them unobtrusively at the bar and brought them in yourself. No waiters scampering about, no muss, no fuss. And even better - reserved seats! For someone who loves movies and opening nights/weekends, going to the movies can be kind of a nightmare. But not when you can buy your tickets a week in advance and guarantee your assigned seat. Boom. Peace of mind like nothing else. Ten pm opening of The Avengers the night before its official release? Done. Showed up five minutes before the movie to get my beverage and I was all set. No waiting in line for two hours, no battling crowds. And the SEATS. Like sofas in their plush glory. Oh, and no kids allowed in evening shows on weekends. Yep. So then it closed. And I was devastated. DEVASTATED. It was going to reopen under the Studio Movie Grille model. Hmm. I quickly researched what that was and my heart sank. It's one of those chains that tries to copy the Drafthouse and has wait staff inside the theater. Dammit. Ok, but maybe it's not that bad. MAYBE it'll work. Maybe they know something I don't...  So last night was the opening of Captain America: Winter Soldier. I got my advance tickets and reserved my seats ages ago. Woo. This wasn't my first rodeo at SMG as I've been several times and I always hate it. I keep going back for the reserved seats (still a thing) and the location (my hubs and I both work uptown and live 10 mins away). It seems to me that it just doesn't HAVE to be this bad.  We got there last night and grabbed drinks from the bar. The bar service is ok, though they never have one of the wines on the list that is actually one of my faves. Since it opened, they've had this wine exactly once. TAKE IT OFF THE LIST. We hung out in the lobby drinking our drinks, biding our time til we had to go into the theater and deal with the wait staff. It was the first Alive After Five event of the season so the Epicenter was a total nightmare (for low-key people like us) and I wouldn't have gone anywhere near it if it weren't for Cap and reserved seats. We eventually made our way in, got our seats and I decided to run to the bathroom before the movie started. I had to go to the fourth stall in before I could find a use-able stall. This is one of my biggest peeves with the place. The bathrooms are both falling apart/rundown and always dirty. It was nasty.   We ordered some popcorn before the movie started and it actually came out pretty quickly. We've been burned by the service so many times I never know what to expect. My first time there, a drink took 40 minutes to arrive. After the movie started, there was the usual distracting murmur as people continued to order stuff and the waiters continued to use their iPhones to place the orders and ask questions, etc. It's REALLY distracting. (At least at Cinebarre, they have a whiteboard you write on when you need something and only talk if they really don't understand something. Also no iPhones.) Another customer in the theater was using HER iPhone as a flashlight to read the menu. Sigh. It's not just the wait staff I guess.  This continued the whole movie, which is very typical. There are a few basic problems with the model. 1. It wasn't built with this intention. It was built as a normal movie theater. At Cinebarre and Drafthouse, the seating is set up with a step down in front of each row where the servers walk without blocking the screen. This is not the case here. Every waiter, every trip up/down the steps blocks the screen. 2. The servers are all completely inept. It's like it's everyone's first job. They don't understand the basics of either common sense OR service. They will nag you for the check, which they always bring during the important climax of the movie. If there's an issue with the check which you need to discuss after the movie, they'll argue about it also during the movie. Last night the waiter handed my husband the check across my face (which he didn't see because he was watching the movie), blocking the screen during an important scene.   All in all, the only thing I go to this theater for is the convenience of my reserved seat. That's it. If they ever got rid of that, I'd probably never go back. It's the ONE thing nobody else does. There are other theaters that sell/serve alcohol. There are other theaters who serve non-popcorn food. But nobody else lets you reserve an assigned seat. And that is 100% all this theater has going for it.",

    "text": "I have visited SMG about 10 times over the last year.  It seems like the service has been gradually getting worse during that time.  Tonight we ordered popcorn, pizza, dessert and drinks.  The desert and pizza came 1st after 20 minutes. (It always takes about 20 minutes to get your food)  10 minutes later I press the button and a different server comes by and I say we haven't gotten our popcorn or drinks.  10 more minutes and I grab a waiter and again mention there is no popcorn or drinks. I asked him to bring it immediately and he was apoplectic and quickly returned with out refreshments.  Of course when I get the bill I have been double charged for the popcorn and drinks.  :-(  Now I have to wait inline with 5 other people whose order were also wrong.  Another issue is that the speakers were rattling during the particularly loud scenes.  This is really not acceptable for a \"upscale\" theater.   I do love picking my seat which are wide and comfortable and will probably be back but won't be buying food/drinks in the future.  I guess I will need to sneak in my refreshments.  :-)",

Me and my wife went this past weekend and we waited 2 hours for our food. I tried to be patient but the movie was coming to an end and i sat and watched everyone keep getting their food. They brought our drinks in the first 30 minutes and i never heard from my waiter again.. After sitting i found a manager to only be told that the oven broke and they cant fix my food. So i wont have to pay for it. But i do have to pay for my drinks... They gave me free passes and the service was so bad i dont even wana use them. I gave them away. Ill just stick to the old fashion date, dinner out to eat and then a movie at AMC!!!",

They also validate your parking for up to 4 hours @ the Epicentre which is great, as parking there is usually expensive. However, I paid extra to reserve my seat online but people were sitting in our seats when we arrived. We had to awkwardly kick them out and feel like assholes - an no one wants to pay extra to have to do that. The food was very meh. Think over-priced, frozen/fried bar food. All very bland. We got some disgusting spinach dip, a chicken sandwich and chicken flat bread pizza. Supposed to be a 2 for $25 deal but somehow the bill was $50. They bring your check while the movie is still going on so we just bit the bullet and paid it. Have had stomach issues since eating there (3 days). If you go I would suggest sticking with beer and a safe bet like popcorn.",

    "text": "This was the worst movie experience I've had. I went to the 12:30pm showing of Transformers in Theatre 4 this past Saturday. There was no warning prior to purchasing tickets that this theatre had no air conditioning. I went with a friend and my 7-year-old brother. We immediately noticed the stifling heat and asked the server if the manager would be turning up the A/C. She said the A/C was broken but that the manager would be coming after the movie to speak with us. At that point the heat was not overwhelming so we decided to stay and speak with the manager afterwards like we were informed he or she would be doing. However, halfway through the movie the heat became overwhelming. I used a small pamphlet to fan my young brother and went outside the theatre on three separate occasions with him so he could cool off. His cheeks were red and I asked if he wanted to leave but he assured me he wanted to stay. Going to the movies is only on special occasions and he had been looking forward to a fancy movie with lunch. We ordered the 2 for $25 deal and to add insult to injury we were served cold nachos and cold pizza. This was the worst waste of $40 I've spent in a long time and I find it appalling that no announcements or warnings were made and nothing was done to make up for the experience. The company just assumed we would all be okay with sitting in this theatre in such heat. We had to figure out what was going on for ourselves in lieu of any announcement of a broken A/C and be placed in an uncomfortable position of deciding mid-movie whether we stay or leave. Quite frankly, I felt dehydrated and uncomfortable for several hours after this movie. After all of this, the manager was not around after the movie. In a 2.5 hour movie, I shouldn't have to fan myself for 1.5 of those hours and count down the minutes until it ends for the final 40 minutes.",

The food is decent for a movie theater- stay away from the pizza and the 2/$25 \"deal\" where they gouge you with a tiny appetizer that definitely won't feed 2 people. Arrive early or buy tickets online to make sure you can pick the seats you want. I love that I can pick my seats in advance, I've never been stuck with a bad one.   The only reason I took off 2 stars is that this place is dirty and there is no customer service. The walls have grease spots, nothing above arm height has been dusted in years, the seats and cup holders always have crumbs or trash in them and the bathroom doors literally have paint peeling off of them. The staff is usually huddled together somewhere chatting, except the bartenders who have been great.

I have not received food twice when all others around have. I have had the wrong orders multiple times. They advertise on the menu for spiked cherry limeade but every time I order they are always \"out\" of the black cherry vodka. The last excuse was the distributor, which I find odd seeing how other places can get it easily. I think it is poor on the ordering side of the place.   Given the multiple times of bad service every time I have come, the manager is quick to help solve the problem by apologizing, refunding and/or giving replacement movie tickets.

Really contingent on the movie you see/ how packed in everyone is. Speaking of which, the new seats are absolutely fantastic.

They usually have a pretty good selection of movies too, almost everything I want to see is playing there.  One of their drawing points though, is also their downfall. I love that they serve food and alcohol in the theater. What is better than eating fries and drinking a beer while you watch a movie? However, some guests seem to think it's a tapas bar and order food and refills constantly throughout the movie, which can be distracting. During one movie, the couple next to me ordered 7 things plus three separate drinks, and then sent one of the drinks back. Even with service during the movie, I still believe that the goal is to be quiet and watch the movie. If you want a full dining experience, go to a restaurant. I can't really blame SMG for this, but I wish there was a cutoff point. All of the food that I had was good, and they carry local craft beers- they're not on the menu though, you have to ask! All in all, this is an upgrade from the traditional popcorn and purse-candy movie experience!",

Me & my roommate went to Studio Movie grill for watching MI:Rogue Nation yesterday noon show at Epicenter Mall, just a block away from my apartment. Located on the first & second floor of Epicenter & the redeem the parking charge up to 4 hours.  It was my first movie experience here & was glad to see that dining tray & service button along with every seat. They have proper dining menu which covers drinks, starters, entree's, salads, pizzas, desserts, etc..  We were not really in mood for proper meal, so just decided to go with a cheese pizza(from kid's menu),  regular popcorn & strawberry lemonade. Food was served in 15 minutes while movie was playing. Everything was served hot & fresh. It was 12 inch pizza cut into 6 slices, thin crust & just cheese as toppings. We liked the pizza. Ordered Popcorn with warm butter, it was decent on portion size. Lot's of popcorn kernel were not popped at the end, which i didn't like. My friend told me that it's common in US that each portion of popcorn will have lots of unpopped kernels. Lemonade was served in big glass with lot's of ice cubes, flavors were mild but was refreshing.  It costs $20 for these 3 dishes, which is an average prize at any fine dining restaurant in Charlotte. Service was really quiet & prompt, not disturbing others as well. We liked the movie as well food at SMG.  Overall it's an experience you get at Studio Movie Grill, dining a proper meal along with your favorite movie.  As they advertise themselves as SMG: Eat, drinks, Movies & they serve them best. Since it's just a block away, i will be visiting SMG often for movie cum dining experience.",

We all left disappointed and said we wouldn't go back.  First, the movie didn't start on time. Not too big of a deal because there were no previews, but that was just the beginning of the downfall.  Second, we ordered our food at 8:00. By 8:45, my husband and I were still waiting on our glass of water and food. By this time the other people we came with had already finished their food, which came to them cold. By 9:00, after repeating what we had ordered, our food arrived. We were lucky that it came warm. About 30 mins after that we were brought our food again....and then, as the credits rolled, a server came dashing up the stairs to bring us yet another order. It was craziness.  One person from our group noticed that the same servers for our theater were also working all the other theaters too!! It's no wonder why food was late and cold!  Lastly, the girls bathroom was so gross. The trash was spilling out the top of the garbage hole in the counter. Some of the stalls had ZERO toilet paper!  In conclusion, if you are looking to have dinner AND a movie, don't. Eat before or after the movie, unless you're cool paying for over priced, cold food.  This place needs better management if it intends to stay in business.",

    "text": "We went to SMG last night to watch Gravity 3D. I really love this location and the concept of a movie theater and bar/grill combined together. The inside is very nice and welcoming. The prices aren't really that bad (plus, we had a Groupon!).   We both ordered a beer (it was $3 for domestic draft.....which for some reason is only Bud Light and Coors Light. Amp up your domestics!) and split the pepperoni pizza. The pizza came out waaaaaaaay before the beers did. After like 25 min or so we finally got our beers. The beer and pizza were both good. No complaints.   I guess my biggest struggle with this place is that they could just do some little changes and go from a \"just ok\" place to an \"amazing\" place. For example: -Have a better ordering/distribution system. I have zero clue why a cooked pizza would take longer to bring out than a draft beer.  -All the waiters and waitresses keep walking by you throughout the whole entire movie.....once the movie starts, lessening the people that walk around would be nice. -Bringing out the checks closer to the end of the movie. They bring out your checks like right at the climax of the movie....which is like 45 min-hour before it is even over. I mean I bet there are a ton of people who would have ordered another drink, if they would have just waited to bring out the bills towards to end. It was super distracting.  -A can of paint to the ladies bathroom walls. In the end, I am not a person who cares about this, but figured it was worth noting for the ladies that did care. The bathrooms doors are all scribbled with \"LT loves ES\" and \"Christy Rocks\" (ok so maybe not those exact names but you get the point). Just a can of paint would make this \"problem\" go away  Like I said, none of these above \"issues\" make or break a place for me. They are just such small things that they could fix to make this place an amazing experience. The dining/bar area is so nice and upscale feel. Why not make the movie watching experience the same thing?",

The girl at the ticket counter was gracious and charming, the staff throughout the theatre were charming as well, and the seats.....I wanted to take one home. They are the most comfortable seats in any theatre I've ever been to. The biggest plus about seeing a movie here (since it's the EpiCentre) is validated parking. That'll seriously save you some dough and will help you forgo a walk through nasty weather, should it be one of those days, to park in the EpiCentre's garage.   Mondays are the day to go if you want to drink whilst watching your choice film. Half off house margaritas? Yes, please. They are actually pretty good, too. They even do this thing called a \"metldown\" that gives you an extra shot and some other goodies. They'll even tailor your marg to your liking. Nice touch, SMG.   We ordered the duo dip. Meh. Save yourself the disappointment. It was just wrong. The cheese was a brick of GROSS and the guac stuff was a little off. The cracker-y things tasted stale. Definitely wouldn't order it again. However, I'm happy to report that the popcorn is fantastic! $5 gets you a gracious amount, too.   Suffice is to say that I really dig SMG....for the movies. I'll definitely look forward to coming back soon!",

They validate parking, so you can park for free in the epicenter lot.     They also serve food and drinks at the theater.  You sit down in the theater and press a button and a server will come to you to take your order.   The food is good, but a bit pricey, ( I assume this is were their profits mainly come from).   The one things that detracts from the experience is the servers are around the theater, which is distracting, but after going a couple times I have become use to it.",

After last night, I can see why. I will say on the dining end: the coconut chicken tenders are fantastic, the spinach dip is great but the chips are thin strips and make it impossible to actually dip, and the drink specials are something that you can't beat while enjoying a movie. However, they only seated us 15 minutes before the movie started. In the past I have arrived 45 prior and started enjoying my food before the movie started. Then it took us at least 30 min from ordering to get a glass of water, we asked 3 waiters! Finally our bill was incorrect and that took an additional 20 minutes after the film ended to settle. Please Please SMG put the customer experience first because currently it feels last.",

The seasoned fries were just OK.   Man the movie was great! The seats were comfy and the crowd silent. So very nice.   Upon leaving.. we had to make a potty stop... man was the that bathroom disgusting! No TP, sticky floors/stalls, broken/clogged sinks, just plain gross.

    "text": "Just having moved to Charlotte we hadn't explored movie theaters yet. Seeing the $5 tuesdays movie deal seemed like a good way to experience a first movie in the city, especially since it's a \"movie and dining experience\". I have been to a lot of these \"movie and dining experiences\" in multiple states and I have to say this is the WORST I've ever been to. Entering you have to park in the parking garage (which they advertise they will validate your ticket for free) which is a nightmare in itself. The surrounding epicenter was pretty rough when we arrived (9pm on a Tuesday)- lot of riffraf and people who didn't seem to be customers of any kind with a ton of cops around. Movie theater was designed to be cool but is definitely stuck in the 2010s or so era. No updates. Place was super dirty. Not busy whatsoever. Employees were ok, not terrible but nothing to write home about. Theater seats were small and didn't recline (whatever) but they were pretty dirty. Popcorn tasted stale. Cherry on top was when we went to leave at 11:30 there were NO employees to be seen to validate our parking, finally found one and she said sorry you have to do that when you come on late movies???? No sign of anything of that yet they want you to pay $20 for parking? We'll be trying another theater next.",

Go before noon on a Sunday and tickets are just six bucks. House wine is five bucks on Sundays (of course you have to wait until after noon to get it).  They also had a pizza special going, but we had just had breakfast.  Cool that you pick your seat before you go in!  We pretty much had the big theater (Theater 3) to ourselves anyway.  We had recently eaten, but had saved a little room for a large popcorn to share (good!)  We each started with a San Pellegrino at just four bucks each (and they were good size ones, complete with lime), since we were ten minutes before alcohol-time.    (Honestly NC, what difference does alcohol make at 12 noon versus 11:50???)    I was happy with my after-noon house chardonnay, and Husband really liked his Creamy Caramel Macchiato Shake: Three Olives Espresso Vodka, Coffee and Caramel with Ice Cream.  I was rewarded with a tasty sip and appreciated it for him, but was happy with my $5 chardonnay.  Surprise of the experience for Husband:  Attendant in the Men's room!  Hadn't run into that before at a movie theatre, that's for sure!  Apparently he could have had his choice of men's cologne.  So I armed myself with a dollar bill before my Women's room experience and didn't need it.  Nope.  Just me and my lonesome in a nice clean restroom.  (perhaps Husband imagined it?  :)  Movie:  Screen, sound...all good!  I see from previous reviews that perhaps Charlotte is not adequately appreciating what you've got...may I just say...how about coming to Raleigh SMG?  We'll appreciate you just fine!",

No more having scrambling to find seats together or developing a crick in your neck because you got there late and there's only seats in the front left.  Do yourself a favor and reserve your seats BEFORE you go - then, just pick up your tickets from the machines in the lobby and proceed directly to your theatre.    If you are planning on ordering food, plan to arrive 15 or so minutes early.  This gives you time to get your order in before the lights start to dim.  It's next to impossible to read the menu once the movie begins - and, no one wants to see your phone on during the movie as you try to see the menu.",

I don't understand why any business in 2017 would have one. Water faucets automatically turn on when you place your hands under them. Soap automatically dispenses doing the same. With a wave of my hand, boom! Out pops a paper towel!   So why in the world would I want some strange dude, who smiles at me and insists on having conversation with me while I do my business, need to squirt soap into my hand and hand me a towel? What is this, 1800???  Maybe it's just me. Maybe some people like having a creepy dude grovel before you in the bathroom for a tip. I'll grant you that. But!   You should at least have a choice! When you empty the soap dispenser and deactivate the automatic paper towel dispenser in order to FORCE me to take advantage of the creepy dude, that is over the line!

It's not your typical ruckus of getting there 30 minutes early to get a good seat, drape jackets over the seats while one person stays behind to watch, and wait to order your junk food in the lobby as you stare at your watch waiting for the line to move and the movie to start.  All while you're hoping to hit the bathroom before the movie so you don't have to ask 800 people to get up and let you by.  SMG just crushes all those experiences.  I went on a Tuesday night, which was $5 movie night (YEAH!!!).  Theater wasn't crowded at all and I had a full pick of seats.  You walk up to the counter, choose your movie and a seat map shows up so you can pick where you want to sit.  It's great, so you don't have to feel the pressure of getting to the theater early to save seats.  Once I sat down, I had a menu where I could pretty much choose whatever I wanted for dinner.  I ended up splitting a \"dinner for two\" style menu with a friend.  We had one app to share, two entrees, and a dessert for an extra $5.  I also had a glass of wine that was on special (and was pretty good, too!).  I got a southwestern salad with chicken that was actually delicious.  I was shocked because it was movie theater food, but it's not some nasty salad that was sitting in refrigerated case.  If you do save room for dessert, definitely get the brownie.  Although the movie I saw was terrible, the experience in the theater was great.  I don't know if this place is different during busier times, but they were quick when the theater wasn't crowded!  Great place to go on a date or with friends, and it's a total bonus that they validate parking.",

Didn't look appear making at all. Then it's half way in the movie and I still don't have my drink or popcorn. I press the order button for service and a waitress comes by and answers two other orders and comes to mine and presses the button then walks away. Didn't even try to reply to my response. I hit the button again and 10 minutes later, a waiter comes and I tell him I haven't gotten my popcorn or drink and if they can please remove it from my ticket. He says yes sir and when I get my bill it was still the original order on the ticket. They still charged me for the sundae, popcorn and drink. I take the ticket to the waiting area and tell them this was wrong. They call the manager and it took 3 tries to get the manager to come. That was a 10 minute wait. Luckily, the manager refunded my whole order. Even tho the movie was great, my experience there was not. Sadly I will not be going to that theater in the foreseeable future. Things need to change to make it a better movie experience.",

    "text": "Great theater in the heart of Charlotte. The seats are comfortable, staff friendly and food is good. The two for $25 deal is an excellent option, which is what we did - pretzel bite appetizer with a blackened chicken salad and a pizza. While the pizza left a lot to be desired and the pretzel bites were over-cooked and hard, the salad was fantastic. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the salad was fresh and hearty. Overall great experience, if the food was better I'd give it 5 stars.",

    "text": "LOVE this concept; wish the service was more consistent. First time was pretty smooth - our server was organized and professional. The last few times however, food has been forgotten, cold, and closing out my check proved to be a nightmare as our server was MIA and didn't bring the check (or even ask if we wanted it).   We had to wait for 20 min after the movie ended in a line of people who apparently had the same issue but with different servers. No apology for this whatsoever.  Another time, they clearly forgot to run our food (literally our whole row ordered at the same time; their food arrived in reasonable fashion, while ours took 3/4 of the movie? It wasn't even meat based which requires extra cook time! When it did come it was very, very cold -I'm not usually picky about temp but this just couldn't be ignored-so we didn't even eat the fries. No apology for this either.    Again, great concept, and a few visits went well, but the inconsistency and frustration of such needless distraction should make prospective customers wary. I still wanna go back to eat while I watch a movie but it's a gamble with the service!!! Hopefully this changes.",

Me and my boyfriend ordered chicken tenders and shrimp combo halfway through the food our waters come out smh . The food was kindof mediocre. Not the best nor the worst at least it came out warm . The server told us our total but I had cash instead she said we will just do it later . So almost when the movie was over she came back with my check, handed her the money . Maybe 20 minutes went by the movie was over and I never seen the server again . My change was suppose to come back $13 ! So we continue to wait after the movie was over for someone to come back . They didn't . When we were leaving out there was a longggg line waiting to speak to a manager .. it was just taking way to long so I took the lost of $13 ! I did not have a good experience ordering food this time . I doubt I will be back . Then we couldn't get our parking validated so we took a major Loss to spend more money than what was expected.",

This theater is in the \"EPICENTRE-Charlotte\" and is around a bunch of interesting shops that sits in the middle of several stories high near uptown Charlotte.  The views are amazing of the Charlotte city skyline as you walk to the theater. Once inside we noticed the whole place is really modern with fancy chandeliers and wild crazy cool lighting. To get to the actual movie theater room you have to go up a really cool escalator with blue lights and carpet on the walls! Once we found our seats, directions appear on the big screen letting you know you can order lots of different kinds of food and drinks ANYTIME during the movie, WOW! We had popcorn, then pizza all served during the movie. The seats are an upscale black leather styled slightly reclining chair with a fold out wooden table that has a button to call a server. Sound and picture quality are excellent as well as the price was very reasonable. We definitely will come back again!  Parking is validated if you park inside the EPICENTRE. Great experience!",

After purchasing our tickets we got to the theater about ten minutes before the movie was supposed to begin. The host gave us some menus and told us where to go. When we arrived to the theater the staff were having some sort of meeting in the theater and told us to \"go away\". So we waited patiently until they were finished with their meeting and cleaning up the theater to then enter the theater ten minutes after the showtime.  We sat down and pressed the service button immediately so that we could order food and drinks before the movie began. There were probably six other people in attendance so I thought the service would be rather quick. How wrong was I...  It took them 45 minutes into the movie for anyone to even come into the theater. Which by then we decided to just order drinks because we were just so thirsty. Only two other guests ordered anything so the service from there was quick, too quick. They had our drinks out in a timely manner but also shined a light in our face to hand us a check which I tried to ignore til the end of the movie. Until, not even five minutes later, the employee comes back with his flashlight to ask for us to pay the bill and continued to shine the light on me until he had my money in his hand. The employee came right back with incorrect change, then was nowhere to be seen again. No one came in to check on the guests or give any refills. When leaving the theater we saw all the staff sitting in the prep room texting and talking with each other.   Needless to say, this was the worst movie experience ever and I even missed the climax of the movie. The theater itself was really nice but the staff were all rude, lazy, and unprofessional.",

To top it off, the ladies bathroom was filthy with flooded sinks dripping on the wet floor (see photos). They eventually closed off the ladies room and when I asked if there was another bathroom we could use, I was told no, this was the only bathroom. They finally had to let the ladies take turns using the men's bathroom. Thank goodness!   We are visiting & staying at a hotel across the way and decided to watch The Accountant on Sat 11/5 @ 8pm.

When Beauty and the Beast came out, I decided I had to try it. I am giving my experience a 4-star review because I had a blast and loved the movie. I thought the seats were comfortable, and contrary to other posts, I didn't notice people walking by. I was actually surprised to see my friend had a drink and the bill and didn't even notice how it got there. It was also $8 for a matinee ticket, and coming from NYC, that is a great price!  The reason this may not be a fair review is that I didn't order food. I tried to order a mojito, but during the film, someone came by and told me they didn't have mint. It was hard to understand, but that's what I think he said. Needless to say, I didn't get my drink. It was frustrating, but it didn't ruin the experience.",

Three people had a casual conversation for 5 minutes before even acknowledging us. And then the person seemed annoyed that I bought my tickets on Fandango and she had to type in my access code. We got drinks in the bar. The bartender was attentive and extremely friendly. But she was the only positive of the night. The bar area was a mess. Glasses and plates were on various chairs and there  were napkins and other trash on the ground. The cooking area near the bar was a mess and there is a nearby room with a bunch of chairs piled up. The area where you show the tickets was understaffed. I waited for a while to show our tickets and was told the theater wasn't ready (this was 10 mins before the show and they tell you to arrive 20 mins early). There was a messy pile of menus and they handed one to me and told me to check in later. Based on the collective sloppiness, we were scared to get food (the whole reason we chose the theater was the food/movie combo). In summary, DONT go to this place. I understand it is hard to get good staffing at movie theaters today but you are paying a material premium at this theater so don't wast your money.",

First of all, our Movie started at 5pm on a Sunday. We weren't let into the theater until 5:01pm.  Second, the seats weren't the same anymore. They are crammed in and do not recline anymore more!! That is the whole point of going, and that is the new trend! Why would you take that feature out??? Third, we ordered popcorn with no butter, and the popcorn arrived with what seemed like all the butter they had on our basket.  It also was extremely salty. Fourth, our server was lazy, messy and kept yawning when she was taking out order.  We also noticed that all the other servers were messy and seemed like they just rolled out of bed. Fifth, my cousin ordered a burger with mayo, server said it came on the side already. Mayo was never on the side so he ate a dry, tasteless burger.  Going to the movies in Uptown, we were already expecting to pay a lot of money, for parking, movie, snacks. Its part of the great experience and we were up for it. However, after all that!! I will NEVER return.  What a waste of money! NEVER AGAIN!!   Do yourself a favorite and check out the theater at Pineville, seats are 100% more comfortable and the people there are super nice and do their job with pride!",

    "text": "I've been going to SMG off and on for a few years. It's a great concept. The food is pretty good. I've found everyone to be friendly. I do have complaints with the execution of the service in the theater however. There seem to be two main issues:  The main issue I have is the general disregard for peoples' movie experience. I went to see Justice League tonight(totally doesn't deserve the bad press it's been getting. Go see it and give it a chance. Will it change your life? No, but it'll entertain you). The servers were making unnecessary noise during the movie, talking to each other and socializing as they were delivering food, which distracted me multiple times. Then the servers were going around and picking up plates and glasses, obstructing my view to get to other tables, during the climax of the movie, which was frustrating. I understand that it's customary in normal restaurants to keep the tables clear, but Studio Movie Grill is supposed to be an improved Theater experience. Leave the glasses and plates alone until after the credits start rolling or until the customer places an order for another drink/food item.   The second issue I have is that there doesn't seem to be a proper procedure for delivering the food to people. We sit in numbered seats(i.e.  G6 or whatever), yet the food delivery people never know where to deliver the food to. I was in Thor: Ragnarok last week and my movie experience was interrupted 5 times with someone else's food. (seriously, I'm not exaggerating...it was 5 times that a server asked me if I ordered X and I was like, \"no\"). When someone orders food, the food intake person needs to write down the seat number in the order so that the food delivery person won't interrupt the movie for people unnecessarily. I loved  Thor by the way.   All in all, I feel like these issues can be fixed with some additional training. If these problems get fixed , SMG will be a great theater option worthy of five stars.",

We decided to give it one more try with our entire family of seven on Friday, November 23, 2018.  Everyone ordered beers, water and food at 1 pm.  At 2:10 we still hadn't even received waters, so we turned on the service light.  After 15 minutes someone finally responded.  We asked about our order and she told us that somehow it had been lost.  At this point, the movie only had 45 mins remaining but our 6 year old grandson really needed food.  They finally brought it 15 mins later.  This was a horrible experience all the way around especially when we had our entire family home.  We just wanted to all go to a movie, enjoy lunch, and one another's company.  Instead, we were all very disappointed and hungry...ended up going to a Wild Wing Cafe to eat.  This theatre is in walking distance from our home and very convenient but we will not be returning because of the consistently poor service.",

No toilet paper in at least one of the stalls, no soap in two soap Dispensers and just...yuck!  The theater - floors were sticky, tray was dirty, even the call button had some white milky substance on it.  The cup holders were full of crumbs.  Our order was incorrect and Luke warm but we didn't even bother saying anything.  Just don't go here if you care about cleanliness at all.  Someone needs to come in here with an entire new management team and staff.  Start from scratch!",

How the twenty dollar pasta isnt worth it..  How the patrons complain about everything. And now my impression of the service has been tainted and I haven't even ordered anything! How do you as  employees stand in a group and complain about complaints???? And maybe if you were not standing in a group complaining, yet working and servicing the patrons this would not be an issue... Customer Service 101 training is needed ASAP",

Last night while the credits were rolling they turned down the volume and announced, \"the movie isn't over yet!\"...this is because they had not yet given bills or collected payment from half of the auditorium. So, the credits had completely finished and the house lights were fully on and we were still sitting there waiting on our bill. I had half a mind to leave out and go pay at the bar. In hindsight that's exactly what I should have done. This place sucks more and more (the movies) every time I come! Last night was it for me. Done with SMG! The lounge is always awesome but the movies, completely sucks!",

    "text": "Great concept but bad execution!!! I went there and the place is clean and the seats are comfortable and the food was pretty good.  However, I ordered a drink and large popcorn at the bar before the show for about $20 and was told that there was unlimited refills for the popcorn.  When I asked for a refill of the popcorn while in the movie the \"waitress\" was totally confused. She told me that only applies when you are in the movie and I told her that doesn't make sense since I bought it 50 feet from the doors of the actual movie. She then replied that you still have half the popcorn left and I told her again that I'm getting a refill because I asked for little butter and as she can easily see that the popcorn was floating on top of the popcorn.  She agreed and gave me my popcorn. So it's check out time and I get the bill for drinks, ice cream and the popcorn. Ugh I didn't want to make a scene at the very end of the movie like others and I can wait. The problem is who wants all those distractions of people arguing about their bills in the middle of a movie?  I guess I can see like others in a place offering too much can get too confusing and it's a distraction.  Good luck!!",

I know it doesn't take that long to cook those items and considering we ordered at the same time, they could've been made at the same time. I also heard another group near us who didn't get stuff they ordered either. A couple of stalls had no toilet paper either but the theater was nice and clean. Oh well.

    "text": "Yelp I need a negative star option... and I'm not a bad review kinda person but this was hands down one of the worst experiences I've had out in a looooooong time.    This night started out magically why? Because I was on a long over due date night out with my gorgeous guy which only happens once every few months or so due to our work schedules....... and then we got to smg .... so we hadn't been to smg for a long time due to the declining level of service we had continuously been noticing but we saw they had the right movie time for when we wanted to go when other theaters didn't and there was a groupon so we figured we'd give it another try.... a swing and a miss!!!!!!!   So we get there I'm feeling extra prepared phone with Groupon pulled up and ready and parking ticket in hand ready to be validated when we walk up to the desk and the lady asks what movie and what not and i tell her the movie and time and that i have a groupon when she barks that they no longer scan Groupons we have to do it online and I'm like cool no big deal and ask her can i do it from the fandango app she said sure or from smg's website whichever. So i pull up the app go the website from the app get all the way to picking out seats and add my groupon code and then I'm stuck it won't let me go further so i ask for help she barks again to go to the website i say I'm on the website the app took me there she barks again repeatedly 3 times in a row \"GO TO THE WEBSITE GO TO THE WEBSITE GO TO THE WEBSITE\" I'm like in my head YO! I'm Effing there!!!!\"      BUT i decided to do it her way i close out of the website log back into my browser go BACK to the website and she walks me (loudly) through the steps which by the way we're not in any way self explanatory as to how to go through this process of redeeming the Groupons when i said thank you she steps back and under her breath or so she thought maybe she says \"WELL YOU HAVE TO READ\"   Yaaalllllll when i tell you how hard it was for me to not lose every piece of my mind on this girl I truly cannot put into words how mad i was. This girl tested every minute of my 13 years in customer service and the ONLY real thing that kept me from ruining our night and her night was the fact that i was on maybe my first real date night out with my guy in 2018 and i was not gonna let her rude disrespect a** ruin our night. It was a challenge but i overcame it (with multiple margaritas in the theatre)   I will from now on drive my little family ALL the way over to cinebarre or beyond to see a movie and if smg is the only one with a time that works then oh well we aren't seeing that movie that night.  Too bad cause smg is in a great location but at this point that IS ALL.  Don't bother wasting your hard earned money there guys even if you have a Groupon it's still most definitely not worth it!",

I thought going downtown for the holidays would be a pleasant treat. We parked at the light rail and got off right at the Epicenter to enjoy the theater.  Lawd have mercy the moment we walked in the door until we walked out two hours later it was the worst customer service we collectively have ever experience. The food server was completely incompetent. She did not listen to the order and made me repeat it over and over. The movie started and we had no popcorn. Major violation! She never came back with the order. Several other servers brought the food. Cold popcorn. Half way through the movie our original server shows up with popcorn and no drinks. We told her no thanks we had our order. Towards the end of the movie right when I was at the edge of my seat and into the movie here comes the server \"did anyone ordered chicken tenders\" NOOOOO!!!!! Go away. Then of course comes the bill which was wrong on so many levels. Don't bother with this place. I have restrained myself from calling it what it is because it is too stereotypical.",

    "text": "We went to the Studio Movie Grill to support a fundraiser for the Carolina Theatre.  The featured film was \"Night At The Opera\" starring The Marx Brothers. I met my friends at the bar, where we enjoyed cheerful, engaging service.  I had a glass of Hayes Ranch Chardonnay (nice pour, by the way)!  Two of my friends had Woody and Wilcox beer, and another friend got the vodka special. When we went into the theatre, the server responded immediately to our request for service.  My friend and I got the $25.00 special, which was an appetizer and two entrees.  We got the cheese fries, which came with some kind of dipping sauce.  All of the cheese, which was reminiscent of food court nacho cheese, was at the bottom of the bowl.  My friend then had a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Although it was challenging to see in the dark, he feared that the chicken was underdone.  I got the thin crust margarita pizza.  If that was thin crust, the regular crusts must have been thick as concrete blocks.  The pizza also tasted like it was frozen, but not as good as Digiorno.  However, when I reheated  the leftovers the next day, it tasted better.  Perhaps the flavors needed to meld. I really didn't expect gourmet food at a movie theatre.  I think that it is really nice that we have a place to go where we can have more than popcorn and soda as we enjoy a show.  Thank you, Studio Movie Grill, for supporting this fundraiser.",

With that said, I found Studio Movie Grill to have a confusing layout, unprofessional staff (friendly, but having phones out texting and talking with each other versus greeting guests) and DIRTY.  The menu was fine, typical fried foods, overall tasteless... but it was nearly impossible to eat at the awkward trays.    Service was alright.. they took our order and delivered... we had our check about halfway through the movie (they collected everyone's at once though... I did have concern that something would get mixed up, but it didn't). If I ever went again, I would just bring cash so that I didn't have to worry about my card. (This was all very distracting from the movie.)  Overall, if you're using a groupon - it's fine. Otherwise, just watch a movie the old fashioned way and go to dinner after.",

Though I'm going to ignore the time I got food poisoning.  Really f'd up Best Man Holiday for me.  It was the first showing of the day and my diet pepsi tasted funky - I believe they didn't purge the hoses or something of the soda fountain - but I spent the later part of the movie fighting nausea.  And it was only 11am, and I hadn't eaten anything prior and that night before was also nothing exotic.  Anywho - the reason I can't rave about this place are the servers.  I hate team service.  They are always nice, but the person bringing your food didn't take your order and the pacing is always weird.  When I talk about weird pacing I mean you get your meal and are damn near finished by the time your seat partner (who placed an order with you!) gets his/her meal.  That is weird.  Not to mention they always get it wrong.  They continually mess up thinks like lemon in tea, or utensils..and good luck getting one of the runners to get you anything.  Seriously they drop down a plate of messy nachos sans napkins and silverware..I ask the runner for silverware and he tells me to ring my buzzer for my server.  Not cool studio movie grill.  How about use some common sense and carry napkins and bundled utensils with the runner.",

There aren't that many showtimes offered.   The screen was really small and the lighting from the stairs really threw off the movie viewing experience. I appreciate that they do the reserved seating thing but it was difficult to get four seats together without splitting rows. We ended up in the back row.   The service was noticeably slow. The waitress had a habit of just standing in the rows blocking the screen. That got really annoying...   A few notes: The ticket counter is on the 2nd floor. Stop there first before heading up to the theaters. Don't forget your parking ticket, they validate. SMG is definitely not my first choice but I would return in a pinch.",

E-F-G-H-I rows are excellent views and you don't have the staff blocking your view during the movie while they are delivering food/drinks.  Why I didn't give it a 5 star-two reasons.  1.Last three times I have gone I have asked for a glass of ice along with my wine, I have had to ask a second time every time for the ice. Not a really big deal, but they promote their customer service/attention to detail everywhere.  2. I couldn't post a pic :(- the pic I took would show you soooo much better than my words can say. One glass of wine is approx. $7. The amount of wine I received was less than 6 oz. I have the exact same wine glasses a home. I took a picture of the wine I got, then compared it to the 6 oz. I poured at home. It was definitely less. So, to solve that problem I bought a bottle for approx. $23! The movie start times are as expected, 15 minutes past the time they are published, so don't worry if you are running late. Lastly, they do offer to validate parking in the garage at the EpiCentre for 4 hours, not valet, so don't forget your parking ticket/stub when you go in!  Side note: We have enjoyed the food we have had (steak quesadilla, sliders)   Enjoy your movie :)",

There were not many so we chose the endless pizza. The pizza was okay. I will say the seats were extremely comfortable, and the wait staff was very friendly. The X-Men movie was pretty packed, but we were assisted in a timely manner and our orders were accurate.  I like the fact that you can see which seats are available before purchasing your ticket; that way you know how full the movie is going to be.

    "text": "I suppose that, for some, SMG would check off all the boxes needed for an evening's entertainment. IF you really want food delivered to you during a picture, by all means, this is the place to do it. But - if, like husband and I, you just want a quality movie-viewing experience without all the fancy frills and hoopla, there are better and more accommodating options out there.  We were supposed to meet some friends on Christmas day for a viewing of The Desolation of Smaug: a recent - but not opening day new - film. Upon arriving (about 25 minutes before showtime), we were informed that the seats were assigned (uh...what?), and the only ones left together were in the handicapped-accessible area. At a loss and feeling pressured, we bought the seats. Our friends showed up 10 minutes later and were told the show was sold out.   We would have asked for a refund so that we could find somewhere else to all see the film together, but there is a large sign at the ticket desk that emphatically states no refunds, no way, no how; maybe we could have asked for a manager and pressed our luck, but on Christmas day especially you just don't want to be *those people*. Our friends left for another theater, and husband and I went inside.  1) When we got in, we noticed at least 6+ open seats in pairs around the theater (which was TINY). These seats remained vacant for the entirety of the show. I don't know if SMG was deliberately underselling the show, or if the seats were somehow claimed (maybe by online sales that were no-shows? That somehow seems a bit unlikely, too), but it just seemed fishy to us that there were so many open seats in better locations compared to what was offered to us as \"the only thing left\", and that my friends were flat out told there were no seats left.  2) The seats were comfortable enough, except, with us being in the handicapped-accessible area, husband got stuck with an office chair instead of a regular plush seat. Meh.   3) Wow, okay. The whole food thing. I get it. I get that some folks want a meal with their movie, I really do. And the servers did generally try to be efficient coming in and out, and to duck under the screen. But, seriously? Major, MAJOR distraction. I want to be focusing on Gandalf battling nasties, not have my attention redirected to the server who's standing in the middle of the theater, confusedly looking around for who ordered the Thai chili nachos.   4) Again, assigned seating, say whaaaaa? Yeah, I understand that it probably helps with keeping track of the food orders/bills. But it's a pain in the butt if you try to make any kind of plans to meet with other people to see a show together. God help you if you don't show up at the same time!   To be clear: SMG didn't show us a bad time. I just don't think we were the clintele they aim to cater to, so their best efforts went unnoticed, and their failings stuck out a bit more. We probably won't be back, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't go, if you like what they have to offer.",

    "text": "Ok, yes, it's novel.  To have food and drinks served to you in comfy chairs with your own desk.  But trust me, buy your tickets on Groupon for $5 to prevent any disappointment.  The place obviously wants to make its money by movie-goers buying food and beverages  If you don't want to buy food or drinks there, don't go because they'll pester you until you do.   It is also clear they make money off the food because I'm pretty sure everything I have ever ordered here was frozen and was of McDonald's quality.  The profit margin is probably pretty high for such low quality food.  The first time I went, I ordered a salad.  Ingredients were cheap and tasteless.  The second time I ordered the Coconut Chicken & Shrimp and was horribly let down by limp, mushy fries with no ketchup and the overcooked chicken and shrimp.  If the waiters walking up and down the theater wasn't distracting enough, the sound was SO LOUD!  I actually plugged up my ears in the action sequences in Guardians of the Galaxy.  Really?    I will take my mom here just to show her what it's like but that will be the last time I go to SMG.",

    "text": "the idea of having a full functioning restaurant and bar in a movie theater seems great right? As much as I would like to believe that, my experiences here have not been that great.  Beginning with the pros, I would like to list all the things that I LOVE about this theater.  -If your looking for a great location to watch a movie, then this is the place! It is in the heart of uptown at the epicenter, where you will not be disappointed with the entertainment. Trust me when I say my night doesn't end at the theater! I always find myself venturing out to a bar/club afterwards. -The theater is clean for the most part. SMG is not like most theaters where you will see popcorn everywhere. It is tidy and has an urban style to the design. Also, they just updated their seating, which is very comfortable. It's somewhere that would be great for a first date. -Parking is free! This is important as prices can be upwards of $40 dollars at the epicenter on a busy night. Just bring your parking slip to the front when you get your tickets, and they will validate it for up to four hours. -The service is at your finger tips. Yes, all you have to do is hit the red button and service is on its way! this is a nice feature because I always need extra sauce, extra napkins, and extra attention. I am what you would call a waiters worst nightmare...Just kidding!   Although having a button seems nice, this leads me to the cons..  -Your button can accidentally be pressed, which actually happens quite often. It is conveniently placed on the food table where food belongs, and for me..my elbows. I always seem to accidentally hit the button and get interrupted during the movie by the staff. As many times as I have been here, I seem to do it every time.  -The food is not great. This is disappointing because that is what all the hype is about. To be served while enjoying a movie. In my opinion, everything is over seasoned. There is healthy options, but those items are NOT healthy at all. Would a salad smothered in dressing and topped with two heaping handfuls of croutons be considered healthy? I think not! Aside from my healthy eating, the other food is just not very good. It is equivalent to bar food. I would only recommend it if you are in need of some dessert. With that being said I am living for their milkshakes! Want an alcoholic milkshake? Well, they can do it!  For me, it makes perfect since to come here whenever I want to catch a movie. However, I am just not in love with the food. You would think it would be much better, with all the competition from the surrounding restaurants. Unfortunately, this in not the case.",

    "text": "It's a movie theatre that serves food. Great concept, right? We went to see Anchorman 2 on New Year's Day but somehow missed the \"grill\" part and ate beforehand- bummer. The seats have little trays and buttons to call a server to you while the movie is rolling, which is cool- surprisingly, they don't really disturb you when they're serving other people in the theatre. I don't think I even noticed them roaming around while we watched the movie.  Anyway, the problem with Studio Movie Grill is the whole \"seating assignment\" thing. We went to see a movie a couple weekends ago and were sadly disappointed that there weren't two seats together anywhere in the theatre. I noticed this when we went to see Anchorman as well- the seat assignments were almost at capacity but the theatre was not. What is that about? We ended up skipping the movie last time and ate dinner at Vida. Bust.  Next time I'll order tickets online and well in advance.",

The movie was supposed to start at 9:45 but they didn't let us in the theater until 9:50 because they were still cleaning from the previous movie. So the movie started 30mins late (10:15). My food came out cold so I sent it back...never received the new one. They charged my card for the entire thing but the manager did go back and take care of my entire check. He was extremely nice and apologetic about my experience and gave us two movie passes on top of taking care of the check. During the movie you could hear the servers on the side having conversation and laughing. One customer yelled \"shut the $;&: up!\" I've heard good things about this place and wanted to check it out, but unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations.",

Both times I have been have been for special events on the restaurant side and both time I was extremely disappointed. The customer service is horrible. There were only few of us who showed up for he event but the bar was already nasty. I sat there for 10 minutes before the bartender even addressed me. Against my better judgement (since my 1st trip here went so bad) I decided to give them another chance and place a order. When I ask the bartender for a menu he gave me the nasty menu which had been sitting in whatever liquid was on the bar and proceeded to tell me it was clean instead of just giving me a dry menu. He immediately asked me to pay or stated he would have to hold my credit card so just like that Studio grille missed out on Getting anymore money from me. The only reason I stayed is bc I paid for parking. Honestly I love this place in order cities but Charlotte's will not see me again!!! To add insult to injury the bartender is being very disrespectful to the few guest who are here to patronize and when I spoke to the manager he didn't really seem to care. Maybe you will fair better with a movie but I feel like they owe me a tip for even coming to this establishment.",

The food quality and prices are excellent. $4 soft drinks in a BIG glass that they will refill for FREE!!!  Tell me one other movie theater who does that?? oh AND they serve it to you at your seat to boot.  Very fair portion sizes on all the food - and normal diner prices too. For the same money I would have to spend to get a small (nonrefillable) drink and small popcorn - I got a nice sized plate of grilled chicken, vegis and rice. and my big drink of soda. I'm a fan of SMG now.........",

The backs of the chair are hard molded at a 2 inch recline. The sides armrest are high, hard and unmovable insuring no contact with the person next to you. So great if you don't like the people in your row, sucks if your on a date. And last but not least, you added rows and chairs so the seats are narrow and the rows impossible to exit. In a time when theaters are working hard to give movie goers something better then there home theater why is SMG going retro.  I would say to nights movie experiences was like watching a movie at my grandmas kitchen table. Food is good and delivered with a smile but still no place I want to sit with a date for two and a half hours, even if Matt Damon is one of the dinner guest.",

Comfy chairs, best in Charlotte.  Wide aisles in and out of the rows and honestly it's never crowded so picking a good spot is never an issue.  I hope it stays that way.  The sound and screen size is superb and exactly how going to a movie should look and feel.  I've never been able to say that going to a movie was relaxing but my latest experience was one of the most relaxing times I've ever had and all the while watching a horror movie.  Interesting.  As we exited the place they even sweetened the deal with a future visit coupon of $5 to come back again.",

    "text": "What a horrible experience!  I am from out of town and did not know how this theater worked.  I checked in at the second-floor counter, but had bought my ticket through Fandango and the girl at the counter would not not help me.  She just told me to go upstairs and she went back to talking to her friends.  The escalator was closed for repairs, so I had to interrupt her and ask her how to get there.   After going outside and back in on the third floor, I was met with a crowd of people checking in for some event, and I had to literally shove my way though just to get in the door.  Where is a manager keeping things organized?  I assumed I had to find another ticket counter, but didn't see one or anyone else to ask, so I went to the ticket taker.  She ignored me for a while and then waited on other people behind me in line, so I had to interrupt her just to ask if I needed something other than my confirmation number.  She said no, but the movie wasn't seating yet.  OK, so how about an idea on when I should come back?    I waited until 10 minutes before the movie time and checked back in, and was sent on my way with a menu.  No explanation of what to do or help finding my seat.  OK, perhaps being rude and letting people fend for themselves is how this theater does business.    I got my order in during the credits, then watched as everyone else got drinks and appetizers.  I finally got a soft drink, even though I ordered an iced tea.  I got my beer, but no glass to drink it from.  I had to wait 20 minutes to get my drink order corrected, and still no food.  After one hour of watching everyone else enjoy their dinner, I called for service to check on my food.  Some idiot said he would check, and then promptly ignored me.  Another 20 minutes later, I called for service again, same idiot, this time I asked to see a manager.  Nothing again.  They brought my check, I informed this person that I never got my food and wanted to see a manager, and nothing.  No apologies, no offers to try to help or make it right, just walked away and did nothing.  The same idiot came back again in response to my next call for service, and acted like he had no clue that this was the third time I had asked to see a manager!   No manager ever came, no apologies were ever given, nothing.  When I left, the manager was at the exit and choose to turn his back on me and ignore me - as is the policy at Studio Movie Grille - until he was ready to talk to me.  I explained the situation, to which he accused me of not wanting to be interrupted during the movie.  Amazing, despite three clear requests he has the nerve to accuse me of not wanting to be interrupted!  He did offer an apology that there was a \"miscommunication\"...not for ruining my evening or leaving me hungry or refusing to serve me or for the rudeness of his staff or the total incompetence they displayed or their lack of concern over a dinner guests sitting there with no food or ignoring my many requests...just for miscommunication.  He erased the charges for the food that I never got.  I explained that I shouldn't even have to pay for the movie because instead of enjoying it, I had to sit there and fight to get someone to wait on me!  Since the tickets were through Fandango, all he could do was offer to try to get me a refund.  Hey, how about sending me home with a pizza or something since It's 9:30 and I still haven't had dinner yet?    I am not from Charlotte, but I do travel here often, and I will never frequent this theater again.",

Well...no. Our food actually came quickly, but it was our main course. The drinks didn't come, nor did the appetizer. In fact, I ate my entire meal before my drink came. Forget about asking for your drink, that little service light means nothing. The waitress looked me in my face and walked out of the theater and never came back. The drink and appetizer finally came at 10:45. I have no complaints about the movie/seating. Oh, they did try to bill me twice, so watch out for that.  The waitress took my card at the beginning. Then at the end a waiter came for my card. I wouldn't give it to him again, he finally used his light and figured out that he was at the wrong seat.",

    "text": "Terrible customer service. The first time that I came to the theatre I could hear the DJ play music outside of the theatre. I complain about it and I was give two tickets to see a movie. I came back to see World War Z and I was told that this was a special movie and I wouldn't use the pass. I only had the option to see one movie and I had already seen that one. The cashier said that they just found out about it. She gave me a student discount, and I still had to pay $21.00 for two tickets.  My girlfriend and I ordered food. What a bad idea!! Her sweet potato fries were soggy and the coconut chicken tenders were greasy and had little batter on them. I order the \"seasoned\" fries and the burger. My burger came out with sweet potato fries and I had to send them back. The burger was a huge and tasted great. The only problem is was greasy that the bun was soggy and that made it difficult to eat the burger. I had to ask twice for my fries and when they came out they were soggy like they were frozen and fried long enough. The movie atmosphere was cool but there are other, better places. I WILL NOT be going back.",

    "text": "I am compelled to write this review although I submitted a survey. My husband and I attended the 8pm show featuring \"Focus.\" The bottom line is that we will not be back. First of all we were outside pulling on the door to get in and it was locked. We tried the door 4 times before the young lady came to open it. We were informed that someone else was supposed to be at the door but that is crazy-to be there watching us go back & forth. It is freezing outside and we are trying to get into the theater and not knowing if there was another entrance, we had walked to another venue next door only to turn around and go back to try the SMG door. If we had not paid for our tickets on line we would have left. Additionally, because the street was closed off to CIAA-we ended up paying $20 for parking. Upon walking to the theater area. I asked a different young lady which theater is showing Focus and was promptly informed by that the person that she was leaving but did us a favor to check in our tickets-really!  We entered the theater and no guidance to our seats-we sat in close proximity to where our ticketed seat were. We sat there and noticed that there was about 3 couples when we sat down. Another couple needed a menu and we gave them one of ours. There was a special CIAA menu. When we were asked about drinks, I learned that there were no mixed drinks-like What! This was because of the CIAA-well card people and give my more than 50 year old body what I want. My husband got a Corona-I declined getting anything. I just did the survey which asked if drinks were brought within 5 minutes of order- Absolutely Not! It was almost 20minutes before my normally calm husband got his drink. People who arrived after us got their foods/drinks and my husband was fuming to the point where he was not going to call for his drink. When it did arrive, it was as though we were bothering someone. A simple sorry for the delay would have been nice. The staff was not friendly at all-only one person said good night although they saw us leaving. We walked all the way to the door that we entered through to be told that we could not leave out of that door. Well your staff watched us walk out of the movie and no guidance. The kicker was to exit the movie and see people drinking at a bar area-what happen to NOT serving drinks due to CIAA. Whatever!!! We went for the in theater dining but realized that it was waste of time to drive from Fort Mill, SC to this place.  Should have read the reviews. I will be blocking them from emailing me with offers even if it is free tickets. Not ever going back. This is our first and we will not be back-live & learn.  The reason for 1 star is because Yelp doesn't allow 1/2 star.",

    "text": "Front door to back door review for first timer using a Groupon.  I first tried to contact Studio Movie Grill (SMG) to understand their parking validation as well as reserving seats, etc.  Their voice message stated they were having trouble with phone and I left a message for a call back.  Couple of hours later, the manager returned my call to answer my questions.  He gave good instructions on where to park and \"how\" to receive my parking ticket for validation (very good).  Upon arrival at the parking garage and up to SMG on 2nd floor I had my ticket validated. I provided the reservationist all my paperwork (not my credit card) from Groupon and email confirmation with the seating I picked.    Let's say \"Tatiana\" was very \"guarded\" in dealing with me.    First Tatiana told me she needed to see my credit card and I stated otherwise with the paperwork.  She then scanned it without problems.  Tatiana proceeded to tell me there were no seats left, and I told her on the \"PAPERWORK\" is the seat I reserved online using my credit card.  I asked to see the Manager I had spoken to earlier, by then she found it and printed out my tickets. A Manager did come forward and her whole demeanor changed.  Tatiana needs more Customer Service pleasantry skills.  Finding my way up the escalator to another desk just beyond the rest rooms, I was greeted in a more kinder fashion with menus.  Found my seat (very comfy) and then began great service with waiter, then drink runner then meal runner.  All the while these runners going back and forth, the movie was so great, they were ghost. (Olympus Has Fallen).  I shared a delicious Roasted BB Chicken Pizza, crunchy Sweet Potato Fries and  bottomless Sweet Tea.  Not a healthy choice, but the food was very good and hot!  Upon leaving to make it to the women's bathroom, it was backed up with folks waiting.  I walked around and found it a nice and cozy atmosphere where you could wait for your movie to begin and have a meal or drink and not rush already having a reserved seat.  In summary, it was easy to get there and depart and Yes, I recommend SMG as an all in one dinner/date experience even on a Saturday night.  Yes, I am a fan!",

    "text": "After having countless positive experiences at the old Epicentre Theaters, I was saddened to see them close.  They offered a unique movie experience and I loved that you could take cocktails and food into the theater! It was always clean and the staff was always stylish and professional.   Upon my first visit to the new Studio Movie Grill and theater, I had high hopes that they would continue the trend I had become accustomed to.  Upon arrival, I quickly realized that they too offer a unique experience, but not in a good way!  The only positive thing I can find to say about it is that the ticket price was reasonable.  The cocktails were awful and took forever to get.  The popcorn was DISGUSTING! I mean, a movie theater should at least be able to get popcorn right! It was beyond distracting to have servers walking up and down the aisles the entire movie, often completely blocking the screen.  With people ordering and receiving food/drinks the whole time, it was incredibly noisy and hard to hear the actual movie.  My friends ordered the chicken nachos and when they finally came, the were completely cold and stale tasting. At the climax of the film, all of the servers were stumbling around dropping off and picking up everyone's checks which caused everyone to have the lights on their phones turned on to fill out their bills.  The staff all seemed nice, but it was almost like it was everyone's first job.  There wasn't any professionalism or poise.  After the movie ended, I noticed a line of people all complaining that their bills were wrong.  Even though the tickets were reasonable, after the ticket cost, popcorn, and 4 cocktails (between two of us, not just me) I spent over $70 for a COMPLETELY underwhelming movie going experience! All I can say is that under no circumstance can I imagine ever coming back. In the future I guess if I want a cocktail in a movie theater, I'll just stop at the abc store on the way ;)",

    "text": "The service here has always been slow and unfriendly, and with watered down drinks and warm beer, no reason to order anything from the bar. I've had mixed experiences with the food. However, it's usually always good for a movie right?  Wrong!!!  Last week we saw a movie in theater 3 and had to sit through the first half with an extremely loud distorted blown speaker rattling and buzzing. During the end of the movie, they just totally cut the surround off and it was like watching a normal TV in \"stereo\" mode. When I asked a manager about it, his reply was actually that they knew about it, it's been like that for months, and there's nothing they can do!  Well then why are you keeping that room open and still charging people for your Studio Movie Grill Experience!!! This so called manager wouldn't last a second in my business. Any of my GMs would have fired him on the spot. I'll never go back.",

    "text": "We love Studio Movie Grill, as a whole, but the last FOUR visits we have had nothing but problems! We've tried talking to managers, they've made every excuse imaginable, and yet each visit ANOTHER problem. I understand that everyone has bad days but again, 4 bad experiences IN A ROW! Today is my husband's birthday so we really wanted an enjoyable, easy experience but that's not what we got. We were cutting it really close to the movie start time (not a problem since we had already paid for & chosen our seats) so I pulled up the menu online so we could decide what we wanted to eat, simple enough right? Nope. We sat down in our seats, immediately pushed our button, and for once the server was quick to appear. We started our order but could tell the server was having trouble working her tablet, we thought because she was new, but then she informs us the menu items have changed and we'll have to choose something else. Keep in mind I JUST looked at the menu online during the drive over, I point this out and she looks at us with a dumbfounded look, so I ask for a manager to come and take our order. The 'supervisor' comes to take our order and again we are told the menu items have changed. What we are asking for is still on the menu, it's just no longer on the 2 for $25 special (it was a pizza my teenage son wanted, pizza IS still on the special but now it's a one topping instead) and since we are regulars (@ 3 visits a month) I ask them to honor the special still listed on the website and that's when the 'supervisor' says she needs a 'manager'... I'm sorry, I thought that's who I was already talking to, nope again! We wait for yet ANOTHER person to come speak with us (the movie has now started and they are talking through it) and he says I'm looking at the wrong menu and that they are a smaller location with different pricing. I proceed to show him my phone and point out what I was looking at *spoiler alert* I was right! He informs me that the menu prices just changed yesterday but furious that I'm now missing the beginning of the movie my family paid $8 each to go see @2:30pm on a Tuesday (not busy at all) I demand he honor the price. After huffing at me, he says fine and then WALKS OFF sending yet another person back to actually take the order because God forbid he actually do it himself!!! After missing several minutes of our movie the fiasco is finally taken care of but this wasn't the end of the problems, our drinks never come! The 3rd time we asked for them another server says \"fine, I'll get them myself\" and storms off. Really? Us actually wanting our drinks is a problem!?! Our server finally comes back 2/3 of the way through the movie, interrupting us AGAIN, to say our card was declined. Seriously? We never gave her a card, we were paying in cash so I have no idea whose card she was trying to run to pay our tab, and when we try to tell her this (while trying to look around her to see the movie we paid so much to see) she steps in front of us to block our view completely! Each of these things all by themselves are annoying but add them together and it's infuriating. AFTER the movie is over I see the first 'supervisor' and decide to go say something, her attitude was astonishing, snotty even. The 'manager' we talked to walks up and his attitude isn't any better. I'm standing there trying to explain to them what went wrong and they don't seem to understand why we are upset. The 'supervisor' says she has to take care of something in the kitchen and walks off just as the 'General Manager' walks up and interjects himself into the conversation. He seemed shocked as well that we are upset so I explain it again and his response set me off \"well we've taken care of you so what more do you want?\"...Seriously!?! First of all, we paid for our meal so I don't understand what he means by \"we've taken care of you\" because all they did was bring us our food which IS their job! Second of all, being rude to pissed off customers is NOT the smartest move, especially coming from the GENERAL MANAGER!!! Needless to say, this will be our LAST visit to Studio Movie Grill at the Epicenter. Finally, while walking to the elevator, we see the 'supervisor' outside smoking a cigarette, talking to an employee of the bar next door... THAT was her emergency in the kitchen??? Just another lovely day in Charlotte!",
