In regards to food Garlic knots were delicious, however their meat and food quality overall definitely needs improvement. Both my husband and I got a sort of pasta. The meat on the lasagna and the meatballs were NOT good and the entire plate looked and tasted like it came out of a box from the grocery store. We wouldn't mind coming back to try the pizza as we saw others eating this and it looked good, but we definitely won't be getting any of their pasta again.",

Some orders come out with plain marinara others come with the creamy marinara listed on the menu. I could take it or leave it. Veggies in the pasta are huge and need more careful attention in the kitchen so I'm not stuck trying to saw a stalk of broccoli into 5ths to make it edible. I'll continue coming here for the convenience, but I would love to see healthier options on the pasta menu.",

We didn't realize there were separate entrances for the bar/patio and the formal dining room, so we sat at a high-top in the bar which had just one other family in it dining out for Father's Day.  Our waitress was more than friendly, but seemed a little overwhelmed as I think she may have been the bartender and waitress for the back room and the patio.  We decided to split the Basil Mozzarella pizza (an 18\" was huge, we brought home 3-4 slices), the baked ziti, and a Tuscan salad.  The salad was plenty large enough for us to share and perfectly dressed! It was so yummy.  The pizza was also delicious with tomatoes and basil, loved the crust! Lastly the baked ziti, it was good, but nothing crazy special.  I'd definitely order the pizza and salad again, but probably not the pasta.  I can say I'll be back soon though, happy to have this place nearby.",

    "text": "I am writing this because I have been a loyal Hawthorne's customer for at least 10years. I used to go to the 7th Street location a lot when I attended CPCC. I now live in Concord close to the Harrisburg location but usually go to Highland Creek location because the food is always consistent and good. I have ordered take out from Harrisburg several times and always have issues. I even brought my sons soccer team there several years ago and was disappointed we had called several days ahead and the manager (Victoria? at the time) hadn't even set up the tables for the team and parents.  So, last week my kids asked for Hawthorne's and I was working in Harrisburg that day and called in an order. First I was put on hold no biggie but then was greeted by another employee a few minutes later that said thank you for holding from Rea Rd, I was like WHAT?? She quickly said oh I was hoping you didn't catch that. Anyway, I ordered a large pepperoni pizza, garlic knots, and a spinach salad. I was told it will be ready in 15mins. I stopped at the store before hand and was worried I would be late. When I arrived 30mins later the order wasn't ready. The restaurant wasn't even busy but I waited. When I got home the garlic knots were undercooked white in color and doughy, the spinach salad had rotten leaves  no boiled egg and the dressing on the side had leaked inside the bag. The pizza was ok, My kids even said \"this doesn't taste like when you go to Highland Creek\". In the past when I've ordered take out from Harrisburg I have been disappointed but never bothered to call. I decided to call this time so possibly this won't happen to another customer. I asked for manager and was told there wasn't one available but if I wasn't happy with my order I could come back for gift card. I don't want a gift card or my $35 back. I guess I will definitely make the drive to Highland Creek or another location. Its really too bad because there are so few Restaurants in Harrisburg and now I will not return,",

    "text": "I asked one of my friends from Harrisburg if he had tried Hawthorne's pizza and he told me to save my money. Even though I asked for his opinion I still like to give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt. Knowing a restaurant can have a \"bad day\" I'll give a place three tries.   So I decided to give them a try and stopped by yesterday to pick up their version of a deluxe style pizza. They call it an \"Elizabeth\". I also added banana peppers. For an 18\" pizza I thought it felt a little light in the box carrying it out to my car. Turns out that was one of the worst pizza's I've ever wasted my hard earned money on. Almost as bad as Domino's.  In my mind, a good pizza should start with a really good quality hand made crust, which this had - no complaints there, and then top quality ingredients, including the cheeses and especially the sauce.  Well, at least they got the crust down pat. As far as the ingredients, what few there were, just didn't taste like top shelf ingredients, plain - for a lack of a better definition. In my opinion the sauce was just wrong. Quality wise I'd rate it right up there with Papa's Johns, the little 'pizza-pizza man', Domino's - or Pizza Hut. I don't have a problem paying close to $25 for a pie but at the very least I expect decent quality. I didn't get that at Hawthorne's. Will I give them two more tries? Maybe - probably - but it won't be for their pizza! Maybe Fuel Pizza will come to Harrisburg some day :)",

    "text": "I would have liked this review to be regarding the food and drinks. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to sit and give it a taste.  We had been wanting to visit this location for over a year and finally decided to do it with a very good group of friends. I really hope the situation was simply because it was probably a long day for some.  We had a party of 10 including kids, and to make the long story short we were waiting for over an hour and they still couldn't figure out how they were going to rearrange tables in order to sit us. We kept seen people come and leave and from our conversations they were waiting for a particular table to sit us which according to the personnel, was been cleaned for over thirty minutes. So I decided to go and check the status for myself. When seen that there were several tables cleaned and that it would only take a bit of thinking putting them together I went back to try and check with the people at front. This time I was told that there were people on the table they were going to assign to us and that they couldn't just ask them to leave. Imagine my jaw dropping when they acted like the ones being insulted. After an hour and approximately ten minutes we decided to just go somewhere else and eat. After all everyone had had a long day on both sides. Before leaving I wanted to leave it on a good note so I approached the hostess to inform her we were going to go somewhere else and got a priceless look of \"after all the work we are putting on this?\".  Definitely needs work on the customer side, and probably a basic math class to know that 5 adults plus 4 kids plus one high chair is 10, not 7. After numerous attempts to correct the number we simply gave up.  Please do yourself a favor and drive to the one Uptown.",

It was DELICIOUS!! The basil gave it so much flavor. And when you dip your slice into their house-made balsamic dressing, it's perfection!! Seriously, I think they should bottle and sell that balsamic dressing. It is the best balsamic dressing I've ever tasted. I LOVE it!! We also had the Gorgonzola salad (without onions or tomatoes). That salad is awesome. Our meal was absolutely delicious. If I had one complaint it would be that Hawthorne's is a little expensive. We'd visit more but they are too pricey. A small, 9\" pizza and salad (no drinks), with tip was a whopping $25! If their prices were more competitive we'd visit a lot more often.",

Outside:   Curb appeal, clean and casual classy.  Plentiful parking.  Inside:   All surfaces where shiny, sparkling and the decor was simple.    Service:   Courteous!  Smiles from the super friendly adorable hostess from the moment I walked in.  She told me what the specials were, and asked me if I wanted to sit down or take out.  I was ushered to the bar, and the service was Quick!  I got my lunch, in less than seven minutes from the friendly bartender.  He showed me my two slices before I left to ascertain that everything was copasetic, and he even offered me a detailed receipt without my having to ask.  Menu:   Lunch menu was nice, with offerings for any taste and budget.  I am from New York, so I get weary when I see \"NY Style Pizza.\"  But this was the real thing.  The crust, the cheese the sauce (it was authentic).  Price:   I kept it super simple with two yummy cheese slices with a perfect Arnold Palmer for just over eight bucks with tip.  Finally: Before you take this review with a grain of salt...  See how many places earn five stars from this Yelper.  Not a lot, so it must be on point.  Now: I am out but I will most certainly, absolutely and without a doubt be back.",

They came out and my server Jessica was so polite when I asked her about it. I took full responsibility bc I am the one who should have asked (how could she have known right? -totally my fault) and then the awesome manager (Joey I think) came over without request and offered to have the kitchen make something else. He insisted and was super genuine- what a great example of providing awesome customer service.  Something that was MY fault and they just wanted to make sure I WAS SATISFIED. Cheers to you Hawthorne's! And by the way the wings are awesome if you aren't on Keto. A must try lol.",

To my knowledge, Hawthorne's is a relatively new pizza chain, or is at least new to this area.  Everything Hawthorne's brought out looked delicious. I shared a spinach artichoke dip with a coworker and it was one of the best I have had. We also elected to try their house special \"inducer\" pizza which was a house made buffalo chicken pizza: amazing. Tons of flavor and plenty for two people to share. We both took slices home.  The chairs were a surprise as they had a lot of cushion. The tables and booths were very neat and clean. There was a chalk board sign with all the specials for the day clearly laid out. Be prepared to pay a bit more for this place, but I think the quality is well worth the price.",

    "text": "I want to like this pizza, it's good, and the crust is really tasty, but it's not great.  The big issue is that it's really, REALLY greasy.  I normally like a good NY slice from the greenwich village subway stop, but this put grease to a new level for me.  I never blott my pizza, but I used a handful of napkins for the top and bottom of the pie.  I don't know if it's the cheese  being lower grade or the sauce, but it's a big detractor for the pizza as appearance is important to flavor.  The pepperoni was not crispy, just hot, and the dough was good, but felt like it could have been cooked just a little more, but that might have been the grease.  Service was also blah!  Half pep/half cheese came out all pepperoni, and the server was not very focused on us, more on the table next to us.  I also don't like how the menu is setup.  It should be easy to understand what I am ordering and paying for a pizza - I had no clue till I got my bill - what is a small cheese pizza cost and large cost?  Bar pie?  New Yorker?  Just call it pizza.  The menu is overloaded - for being a Pizza place, pizza is footnote compared to the other items (sandwiches, pasta, bakes, wings, appetizers, salads, strombolis, calzones, random chicken dishes, etc.)    Bottom line - it's OK - but don't go out of your way for their pizza.",

    "text": "Dined here with my husband and 3 year old son for dinner, we arrived around 5 and the restaurant was less than half full.  We were sat quickly and received our drink orders in a timely manner. We ordered a pizza with half pepperoni to share. The pizza arrived in a timely manner but was all pepperoni instead of being half.  We pulled off the pepperoni for our son and began eating the pizza. Our server finally came to check on us about 15 minutes after the pizza was delivered to see how it was...at this time my husband who had not been at the table when the pizza was delivered, mentioned the mix-up....the server half apologized, saying he thought we asked for all pepperoni and breifly offered to get our son a piece of cheese (my son was already done eating at this point), we declined and he left. At the end of our meal, he brought a check with the charge for a pizza with pepperoni (instead of the half pepperoni we ordered). He tried to make it \"no big deal\", stating the half pepperoni only saves you 1.50 but that he could change it if my husband wanted.  My husband asked him to change it and gave his credit card to run.  At this point my husband left to get our child in the car, when the server came back with our check, he had charged the full amount to our card. So, unfortunately the restaurant lost a star for this move.   As for the pizza........ The crust was very tasty, nice flavor, thickness and crunchiness on the edge, a little soggy on the underside in spots.  I thought the sauce was decent but a little sweet for my taste. The big problem with the pizza was the crazy amount of grease on the pizza (my husband who typically never blots grease off his pizza did tonight).  Overall I would have given the restaurant a 3 star rating for the food taste/quality.",

Their salads are really good and a big step above quality wise than you would expect from a pizza joint. That is my overall summary of Hawthorne's but this particular time I ordered the buffalo chicken Stromboli and my husband got the Italian. He enjoyed his but I was very dissappointed with mine. It'sbeen a year since I last had it and was very happy with it before. This time it had little flavor, almost zero buffalo flavor and was made with breaded chicken tenders. I don't remember that being the case the last time. Basically it was breaded buffalo season tenders and mozzarella cheese. No extra hot sauce inside, nothing.   I typically eat extremely healthy but decided early in the week to splurge and get this. I had been looking forward to it all week and ended up disappointed and cranky afterwards. I guess the positive side is that I only ate half and threw rest out...positive in that it wasn't as many calories From eating the whole thing. :(  If I go back, I will stick with their salad.",

We have received horrible service by a specific server a few times.  I wish I knew her name, but she only left a poor impression.  Both times this happened we had a group of about 8 people.  As a former server of many years- big groups are where the money is made, but you also have to work harder- which she obviously does not care to do.  On the specific night I'm referring to, both my husband and another diner in our group wanted lasagna.  The lasagna had apparently ran out for the evening.  Instead of telling us in a professional way or maybe suggesting an alternative, she responded with \"you should have came earlier if you wanted that.\"  We all looked around at each other, pretty shocked that the server would say that.  It was a very rude response.  The food then took a very long time- not sure if this was the kitchen or her not being prompt sending our order in.  The food was OK when it got there, but the service we received was so sub par the night was tainted.  Unfortunately this made an entire table of Harrisburg living friends to not return.",

I ordered the Tri-color tortellini with 1 meatball on the side the dish came with the meatball chopped up in it, ruined the plate.  We also had to remind the waiter that the BLTA (Avacado) did not arrive with the other dishes, despite clearly watching him write it down in front of us.

And of all the restaurants in the Harrisburg area, this is one of the best!!  Calzones are great!! Enough for leftovers for tomorrow.",

    "text": "Absolutely nothing to see here, folks.  I visited this place on a Saturday afternoon and I can confidently report that there is nothing slightly reminiscent of NY-style anything. The decor is quite drab and sad. It's a mostly wooden interior with a couple of large screen TVs. There seemed to be no order to how the tables were set up.  The bar area? quite sad.  There seem to be a couple of entrances to this place. The one I chose, didn't have a hostess so I had to awkwardly walk well into the restaurant, past tables and such, to get assistance.   I ordered the 9-inch BBQ chicken and it tasted quite similar to Papa John's - honestly. The 9-inch contained four wide-ish slices of pizza.   The service was friendly and courteous but I would not come here looking for anything like an authentic NY slice.",

It's always disappointing since the carry out portions in containers are so skimpy. Honestly, we just feel ripped off every time. It's expensive, garlicky & we just never learn.",
