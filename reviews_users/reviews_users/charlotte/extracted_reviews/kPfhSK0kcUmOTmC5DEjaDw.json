Yes, it's near a Dollar General and a Sweepstakes place in a strip on South Blvd, but it's truly a diamond in the rough.  The sweetened beverages are highly recommended - the Vietnamese coffee and jackfruit smoothie were both real treats. The menu features a great selection of not only Vietnamese dishes, but also Thai and Singaporean. The pancakes with lettuce and mint were pretty amazing, as was the spicy lemongrass tofu with vermicelli. Very happy I came here. No problems with service. Hope to be back soon.",

I love new weird crazy food and their is no shortage of that here (but still options for people less Adventurous) .   I got the avocado smoothie: very rich (split it w a friend) and not really sweet but really good (especially for avocado lovers)  The crispy egg rolls: good- not the best but I'd get them again. It was their homemade sweet chili sauce that was awesome. (comes in a reused bottle with a tape lable that says \"sweet Chili\" ... Doan must have made that herself-- sooo good. put it on everything.  Overall definitely a good choice! I'll be back!",

    "text": "Okay place to get your Vietnamese fix.  It's a nice place, space wise, however the food isn't out of this world. It's okay for Vietnamese food in the South. Can't really compare it to California or homemade   Would I come back again? Idk, depending if the other Vietnamese places aren't good.   To start the Pho, wasn't so... good. You get a lot, for the price you pay. I got a small which was about 8ish dollars. Not too bad, it's just the broth, there isn't much beef flavor in it. Like they didn't cook the ox/ or beef bone long enough. It pretty much taste like hot water with a slight beef flavor. Those of you who know PHO, know that the broth is what makes the soup!  I Also order Spring Roll, 2 rolls for $3.50... It was pretty good, the rice vermicelli noodles were cooked nicely, it wasn't hard- which mean they didn't pre make the rolls, they made it to order. The mint and other herbs in it was fresh too. And the Shrimp and pork belly fat were cooked perfectly.    I also order the rice vermicelli ( because I'm a fatty xD lol... I actually brought it back to the hotel), That was actually really GOOD! So much better than the pho! Veggies were fresh, the noodles were cooked correctly, the meat (pork, shirmp an eggroll), were nicely flavored and grilled. If I were to come back again that is what I would order again.  Lastly, the fried banana.... ugh such a disappointment =(. I thought it was the traditional Vietnamese fried bananas (chuoi chien). That was a big NOPE!, it was baby banana wrapped in a wonton skin and deep fried Dx.... The foodie in me just died when it came out to me...  So if you ever had Traditional Vietnamese Fried Banana, this is a SAD EXCUSE OF CHUOI CHIEN!",

    "text": "Yet another Vietnamese restaurant that is 5 minutes away from the 2 other Vietnamese restaurants on South Boulevard. Initially, I was pretty excited that Doan's was opening. Word came around that the owners were from the west coast, Seattle specifically. I thought that would bring some competition to the table and maybe, just MAYBE, I'll have a good go-to Vietnamese restaurant on my side of town. I tried Doan's within the first few weeks of its grand opening. Then again with some friends and again with my parents, and again and again with more friends. I know restaurants cannot be judged based on grand openings. They need some time to readjust and perfect the details. Well it's been about 10+ visits and sorry, I give up.   My girlfriends and I stopped by Doan's last night after a long day of shopping. We wanted something warm to ease the chills randomly rendered (in Charlotte anyway) by mother nature. As I browsed through the menu, I thought of my previous visits. I've tried the pho before and it lacked flavor and ingredients. There was barely any meat, just noodles and broth. I've tried the Bun Bo Hue (a spicy lemon grass based soup) and there wasn't even the slightest bit of Bun Bo Hue flavor in that broth. It tasted like chicken soup with noodles and peppers. I've tried the Com Dac Biet (which is the specialty broken rice dish) and it was TINY. With all of that in mind, I went with Banh Canh, which is another traditional Vietnamese soup. Banh Canh normally comes with lots of seafood items such as crab meat, shrimp, fish balls, etc. All I got was.. fish balls. I have so little expectation for Doan's that all I hoped for was that the broth was decent enough to consume.. and it was! yay!  Needless to say, Doan's does not hold up the caliber of a Vietnamese meal. I must say, the first time I tried their Bun Bo Hue, it was AMAZING! A few months afterwards, I ordered it again and they decided to take out some of the meats and veggies that the dish comes with and oh, removed the flavor too. I never know if I'll get the same thing I ordered last time. I love supporting my Vietnamese community, but I honestly never know what I'll get when I stop by Doan's.",

We ordered canh chua ca (vietnamese sour soup with fish), ca kho to (clay pot fish), fried egg rolls, mi tom thit (shrimp and pork with egg noodle soup). I also ordered a vietnamese coffee as a drink. The vietnamese soup was quite tasty; just a perfect blend of sweet and sour. I did not try the clay pot fish, but my friend said he really enjoyed it. I thought that my bowl of egg noodles were a bit salty, so I did not finish it. But overall, the restaurant was extremely clean and our waitress was wonderful. She was prompt and also informed us that the vietnamese sour soup and clay pot fish dishes would take awhile, since it is made to order. The coffee was also tasty and fresh. Normally, a lot of restaurants would use pre-made coffee and just give it to you in a to-go cup, but this restaurant actually brought it out while it was still dripping from the coffee maker. That is a plus in my opinion.   All in all, I would definitely go back here, but probably wouldn't order the same bowl of egg noodle soup.",

    "text": "Ended up in here for lunch and assumed I wouldn't have enough time for hot pot and in general it was 90 degrees outside so I plan to just save that for another time. I will say that after seeing the soup dishes at a few of the other tables I've only further solidified my desire to snag some in the future.  This time I ended up with the vermicelli noodle dish, \"Singapore style\". I believe the only major difference between this and the other vermicelli dishes is the spiciness which I enjoyed. There are several meat selections that are possible but I went with the beef. The beef itself is fine but nothing really more than your typical inexpensive and thin sliced portion. Not that the portion was small at all though; I'd say \"just right\". Flavor and spice of the entire dish was good but there were a couple of bites that felt a little dryer than I'd prefer. All in all reasonably priced and good tasting meal at $8.75 which I thought was well worth it. Could have been a bit more spicy for my taste but that could be my fault for not requesting the house-made chili sauce Tonya P mentioned in her review.  Ill definitely be headed back here again to explore other items on the menu; especially the soups. Ill be sure to update this review after that but don't expect an update on that until after the summer heat subsides!",

Good amount of meat, and you can tell they serve it hot and fresh (as the beef is ever so slightly pink when it arrives). My only qualm here is that I wish the dish of \"pho-ccutremen\" (basil, jalapenos, etc) offered a little extra jalapenos. No worries though, simply ask and you shall receive.   My friend ordered a dish featuring shrimp and lemongrass. She seemed to enjoy it quite a bit as well.   The Vietnamese coffee was SO. GOOD. Perfect amount of condensed milk.   Service can be a little slow sometimes, and they aren't typically as friendly about answering questions regarding a particular dish. But, nothing that would ever keep me from returning.",

At Lang Van, it is all fresh herbs and  homemade sauces.  So, with great anticipation, I went.   I was glad to see that Doan's has a vegetarian menu.  The only accessible menu online was a snapshot.  There was glare, and I think that the vegetarian part was omitted. I ordered the summer rolls as an appetizer.  They were nicely wrapped and included tofu, vegetables and noodles.  The peanut sauce was served in a squeeze bottle, which I found somewhat off putting.  It also was sweet and syrupy, reminding me of carmel sauce. For my entree, I ordered Pad Thai.  It came with tofu and vegetables, all cooked very well.  It had a smattering of peanuts to the side of the plate.  It wasn't very spicy, although I think the description called it as such.  I put a large amount of siracha  sauce on it to add that bite that I love.  The dish also seemed a bit more sweet than savory. The service was good, and it definitely was not a bad experience.  But, I will probably stay on my side of town when I am craving Vietnamese food.",

Along with another patron, we opted to seat ourselves.  Finally, we were recognized and the journey began.  The sweet tea was delicious (I often opt for water).  The mussels were tasty as were the egg rolls (they were served steaming hot).  Both appetizers were a hit at our table.  For my entree, I opted for something spicy and ordered SP2, Singapore Style Noodles - Bun Singapore (shrimp and stir-fried vermicelli).  The dish was fabulously satisfying!  However, it was not spicy at all.  I forgot to ask why not, but on my next visit, I will ensure my waiter understands that I want the spices.  I added a mixture of their special red pepper sauce and some fish oil which gave me the spiciness I craved.  Because my meal was delectable, I cannot help but give Doan's 5/5 stars.  I sincerely hope the tradition continues and the food does not lose its tastefulness.",

Whatever you do, get the smoothie no matter how full you are. I'm drinking ours at home and can't put it down. My soup was good; fiance says he should have ordered the rice noodles instead of the egg. His dish was a nest of deep fried noodles acting as a bed for stir fried vegetables. Hard to eat but hey we were trying something new. All the waiters were so nice and seemed happy to be at work. Not something you encounter every day!",

I've been here before and I love their tofu pho. It's hard to find but I like that Doan's gives you the option between plain tofu and fried tofu.  My partner ordered the veggie fried rice, and we had crispy spring rolls to split as an appetizer.  My pho was very good. I ordered the regular size portion. Good amount of noodles, enough tofu for my taste, and some extra green onions, mushrooms, and carrots. I added most of the toppings that they gave.   Loved the portion sizes, loved the flavor, my partner loved his rice, and we will definitely be back to check out more of their vegetarian section!",

    "text": "Off the top:  Fresh toppings for their Pho Soup!    (Some Vietnamese places have the nerve to try and hand-over less-than nice ingredients.  So now I always smile and say when I order, \"I just love Vietnamese food!  Especially all those lovely fresh toppings for the Pho!\" (hint, hint, wink, wink)  One time, at band camp.... um, I mean, One place, once, gave me Basil with brown spots and when I called them on it, they actually said, \"OH, DAT FRESH!\"  Um.  No... but I digress.)    That was NOT the case with this place!  Fresh and presented with care!  The broth for the Pho was fine --  I've had home-made, in the home of a Vietnamese family, who boiled their bones for days, so... this restaurant is more like getting the grocery-store stock version.  It's fine.  (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)  The noodles were slightly wadded in the bottom of the bowl, which is a tip that they're not as freshly made.  I had to pry them apart with my chop sticks and stir with vigor.  When eating the noodles, they were a tad gummy.  Again, a sign of advanced prep.  But at the end, once I added the delightful fixings, I had a decent bowl of soup.  Their Summer roll was nice and fresh, and the shrimp was nicely cooked.  Not over-cooked.  The peanut sauce was a little light on peanut flavor.  But, TBT, I took the second one home, since it was too much food, and the next day, I ate that one, day old, and actually slightly dried on the edges, and it was surprisingly tasty, even with the extra body!    I ordered the Thai Tea, and it was like a reddish-brown rice milk with a lot of raw cane sugar flavor.  Not much for any tea flavor there, and was too sweet for me.  I had a few sips, but left the rest.  Over-all, Doan's is not a bad place, and if you line this place up, against others, I suspect these guys have an advantage, if they are consistent (I've only been once, so cannot speak to that.)",

They was kinda busy so i understand that service was going to a little slow. We was seated shortly after getting there but didnt get any service. Nobody came to our table to even ask for our drinks. We waited for 30 mins, still nobody came so we waited a little longer, and by this time it's been almost an hr. And people who came after us was getting service before us. (About 4 groups) So at that point we decided to just leave, and i have never been back.",

With Tonya P and Dan C as fearless guides, they ordered some starters for the table. Grilled Meat Rolls - neither the name nor the pictures do them justice - they're like summer rolls with a thin slice of grilled steak that you dip in the house hot sauce or peanut sauce. Yellow pancake - filled with shrimp and other goodies, you put piece in a lettuce leaf with basil and fish sauce - so good it will make you insane. I was not brave enough to eat tripe or tendon in my Pho, so I had the P3, Pho with Eye Round and Brisket ( had them add shrimp for good measure). Man oh man, do I like Pho. Move over Ramen, I think you've been replaced. It was a perfect dish for a cold rainy night. The Thai Tea was so good, sweet and smokey, that it didn't last a minute. Really cool, nice and clean restaurant with awesome food. Add to it wonderful company, Andy the firecracker/suave owner who took care of us and the world's best modern acoustic lounge streaming station, then you have a winning combination for a \"good times will be had by all\" evening.",

I was really hoping I'd be drawn as the winner, but alas, I didn't end up getting the winning call.   It's a clean space, nice tables. They did a nice job decorating and tinting the windows. They even have a couple fragrant candles going right when you enter. It's a warm and cozy touch. If you are like me and wash your hands before every meal, they have an extra sink outside of the bathrooms...convenient!  The Singaporean noodles and Pad Thai were okay and a tad on the dry side during our first visit. However, they must have practiced making those a few extra times since then because when we ordered those dishes again, they were very good. Yes, yes, I know this is a Vietnamese place and we ended up ordering non-Vietnamese dishes...those noodle dishes were calling my name! Next time I promise to try the veggie pho. They also make a very spicy garlic chili sauce! Mmmm, your mouth and lips will be on fire. The servers came around quickly to refill our waters and laughed as we dabbed our foreheads with the napkins.  Nice addition to South Blvd! I like that I can choose from 3 different Vietnamese places all within a mile or so of one another. Variety is the spice to life, right?!",

    "text": "Quite easily, the best pho in Charlotte.  It's currently a four-star rating, but that's only because I haven't tried the rest of their dishes.  One less star just means there's room to grow - I don't want to cap its potential!  This place is a bit under the radar.  Everyone raves about Vietnam Grille, Pho Hoa, Saigon Palace, etc. but none of them beat the pho at Doan's.  It's time to blow this place up and let everyone know:  The broth is unbeatable.  Have you made ramen noodles and poured in that powder soup base?  The directions generally say you should add the powder after the water is boiling.  What ends up happening is that the soup still just tastes a bit watery and bland.  Sure, it's fully dissolved, but it's different from when you just pour the powder in with the water, pre-boil.  (Yeah, I'm a ramen master... I got accoutrements you can't even imagine!).  So... back to the broth - it's nowhere near bland and doesn't have too much star anise, cinnamon, or whatever spice gives it a light sweet taste.  Doan's might be under the radar for the general public, but apparently Vietnamese people know what's up.  It's always a good sign when there's a bunch of Vietnamese people in a Vietnamese restaurant, dontcha think?  They have options, but they choose to come here.    Service Highlight - We got all of the limes that are table wanted.  Lime shortage?  Ain't nobody got time for that?  Certainly not Doan's.  They're not sheisty with their limes.  (Really?  A shortage of limes causing its price to spike?  It's a friggin' lime, but I digress.)  I'm a fan.  Pho lovers, give this place a shot.  dmo out.",

So I had my sights set on Vietnamese for lunch earlier this week and instead of visiting the usual place up the street from Doan's, I cam here.  I was pleasantly surprised with the decor of this restaurant.  I really expected it to be a hole in the wall but it's a nice casual restaurant with booths on either side and tables in the middle.  My first test for Vietnamese places is usually pho but it was 95 degrees outside and it was definitely too hot for soup.  So as I checked out the menu, this one item stood out to me...Spicy lemongrass vermicelli.  Added a bit of chicken to go with it.  Service was exceptional here.  Both servers waited on me and were happy to answer any questions I had on the menu and the restaurant.  The food came out and it came out and I was impressed.  Veggies and chicken were stir-fried before placed on top which gave them a really enjoyable flavor.  The chicken was tender and there was just enough spice to the dish that I really didn't have to add anything else.  I think Doan's is definitely better than one of the other Vietnamese places on South Blvd. I'll have to come back again to see if they can top the other place.",

    "text": "4.5 stars. Really great Vietnamese food here. I was reluctant to try it because my Vietnamese friend from work doesn't like Doan's, for whatever reason. But I said what the heck. So I've got strep throat, and I'm thinking the Jewish Mother's cure - Chicken Soup. Voila.....PHO! Great opportunity to check out Doans. I am VERY glad I did.  Started with the summer roll, which is light and wrapped in rice paper. I wanted a healthier alternative than the deep fried egg rolls, and this hit the spot. I did find it odd that they gave you an entire squirt bottle of peanut sauce....but, it was really good so no complaints about the odd presentation.  Then the pho. I got Chicken Pho to help quell my strepped throat, and this was VERY good pho! I love Vietnam Grille's Pho as well. Theirs is a little \"heartier\" and Doan's is more \"feminine\" and complex, with deliciously developed flavors and aromatics. Lots of scallions too which I love. They give you some bean sprouts, fresh basil, jalapeno's and lime as optional add ins. I added a little of each. The vermicelli at the bottom of the pho was good, but I was surprised at the white meat chicken. I thought, OH NO, plain old chicken breast with no flavor. SURPRISE.....the chicken picked up the delicious flavors of the pho broth and it was very good! Pure chicken breast and a good bit of it, all makes for a healthy yet satisfying dish!  Just had to also try their Singapore noodles.....OK so I'm full a this point, but I live 5 mins away and thank God for takeout......so they bring it (my waitress probably thought I was a piggy for ordering all this food - oink, oink, snort) and it was very good. Nice flavors, but a tad dry for my liking....I would have preferred a bit more curry sauce, but overall the flavors were there.  Nice folks who work in here, and it's a clean place with Vietnamese music playing. Oh, I did get to listen to Vietnamese RAP for one song......WOW did that sound different! It wasn't like that crappy gangsta rap or anything, just Will Smith-like......in Vietnamese. It was......different.  Overall a really great restaurant. I will definitely be back!",

We drove a little over an hour to eat there so as soon as we got there my boyfriend needed to use the bathroom. As he was walking to the restroom I was being seated. She asked for my drink order right away and didn't give me a chance to look at drink menu. She seemed a little annoyed as I took time to look. I ordered a young coconut and water but didn't get the young coconut until the end of my meal when they tried to charge me for it but didn't even give it to me. When he came back we started to order our food. We order the yellow pancake with lettuce and fish sauce. The pancakes were a great size, but they only gave us 3 pieces of lettuce. When we requested for more lettuce the waitress informed us that it would an extra charge of $2, which is ridiculous to me. We decided to get it cause it would not be right to eat the pancake without the lettuce. We also ordered the small hot pot for us to share. They portion was the perfect size for the both of us. The broth we got was the tom yum broth and it was delicious! After our meal we got our ticket, another downfall was that, everything was written in Vietnamese so I'm not even sure what I was charged for. The food is great but everything else I wasn't impressed with. It's a little pricey as well. Not sure if I will return.",

    "text": "It takes a lot for me to stray away from ordering pho at a Vietnamese restaurant. There's just nothing like it.. especially on a cold, rainy night. However, I did my homework on Yelp beforehand and knew I had no choice but to cheat on my go-to.  I ventured here with a group of Yelpers. We got a bottle of wine and some apps to start off the meal. Tonya recommended the fresh rolls, but with the grilled meat. I usually get mine with shrimp. Never again. The flavor with the meat was so much better. We also got a giant yellow pancake. I think most people get this as an entree. If you have a group, it makes for a great app to share. Filled with shrimp and all kinds of other goodness, cut off a piece and wrap it up in a piece of lettuce. Make sure to dip it in fish sauce!  I studied pictures on Yelp ahead of time and knew that I wanted the spicy lemongrass shrimp. Was it worth a temporary break-up with pho? Hell yes. Will I now be forced to order both pho and this when I come here? Probably. Dan C let me try the broth on his pho. Delicious. For my vegetarian friends, they have a ton of options here.   We got an avocado smoothie to share. I highly recommend. So unique and different. I'm not sure if I could drink a whole one by myself. The Thai tea was also great. I could probably drink one of those in two minutes.  Andy, the owner, took care of us all night. Such a nice guy. I was also digging his choice of music for the evening. I collection of alternative songs all done acoustic. Among the selections: I'm Just A Girl. Solid. I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "This unassuming establishment is quietly nestled in the middle of a strip mall and provides a clean environment and flavorful food!   I will start my review with the disclaimer that all three visits I have made I have only had the hot pot with the tom yum broth. This dish is so amazing I haven't yet been tempted to try anything else on their menu, though the other options have looked good while they pass our table.   The tom yum has a delicate spice that slowly builds as you eat more. We have tried with chicken, shrimp and beef and the shrimp made the best combo with the beef a close second. We always get mushrooms and broccoli and prefer the egg noodles to the vermicelli.   The only complaint that I have with this restaurant is that the wait time after ordering can be quite a long time. When we went last night we had to wait an hour for the hot pot so appetizers are strongly advised if there are more than a few people in the restaurant (my personal favorite is the grilled chicken rolls).  The hot pot is the perfect dish on a rainy or snowy day but only pop in to try it if you aren't starving.",

As an authentic place, they have your sriracha and other sauces on the table for your pho.  The service has always been good for us, but sometimes you may have to call someone over to fill your drinks. And yes, this is in an unassuming strip mall on South Blvd but worth a try.

The food is worth coming back for though. Just gotta hope you get a nice server.   Note: their Pad Thai is no Bueno.   Another-nother note: their Thai Tea is made of some powder, not freshly brewed.

    "text": "We ordered to go from Doans for the first time last week......our faces were shocked when we had two shopping bags full of to-go food when we arrived to pick it up!  Doans in located at the end of a shopping center. Besides the Food Lion, I dont think there is much to note in this shopping center.  We ordered the yellow pancake, spring rolls with fresh meat (pork), the beef Pho, and the avocado smoothie.   As I had strep throat, the smoothie was like heaven. It was so creamy. I dont think I have ever tasted anything like that, ever! It was just so perfect! The yellow pancake was ginormous and the fillings inside were yummy. The pork in the spring rolls were a great call and the dipping peanut sauce with it was a great additive. I liked the flavor of the broth in the pho. I didnt realize we would have to assemble it all, though. Since I was sick, this was a bit of a pain. They literally gave you everything to put it together though! The beef eye was a bit weird and did not make it into our pho!   My only small complaint was that every single thing was cold....well I guess the smoothie and spring rolls probs should have been cold! We called it in as we were leaving the house and live less than 5 minutes away. So, it was a bit of a disappointment to have to heat everything. Small inconvenience but the food was very tasty!",

Yelper's are the coolest reviewers when it comes to dining and providing feedback on where they visit throughout the day/week.  This place was empty. One of the employees was having either late lunch or dinner. We waved to the guy in the back and he sat us in a booth.   I feel like I am back in NYC and at a rice and noodle restaurant. You get a menu. The waiter comes back with two glasses of water and get your order then other staff member comes back with your meal. Then you ask for check and you pay and go. LOL... Believe me prices in NYC cost less than here in Charlotte when it comes to Vietnamese Food. Guess, it premium food at premium prices here.   The fried calamari was lightly breaded and tasty not heavily fried nor greasy.  Only two fried spring roll, use to getting four. It's a whole new world when it comes to dining here in NC.  Had 2 orders of the P3 Pho- The one with Eye Round and Brisket and that was very good and soup base did not have MSG or my head would be aching by now.  Ordered Vietnamese Coffee, and they came back with the coffee and a glass with ice. I wanted hot coffee, so they got a cup of hot water. It seems that everyone here gets the Iced Vietnamese Coffee. Love my coffee piping hot.  Will be back again to try their other items. Only half an hour to eat and run.",

If you are used to Vietnamese food from cities like Atlanta, D.C., or anywhere on the west coast, you will probably think this place is just OK and overpriced (it is), BUT for the crappy Vietnamese restaurant options we have locally, this is leaps and bounds better than anything else you'll find... so that is worth something. My family is Vietnamese, and when we don't feel like cooking, this is where we will typically go for Vietnamese food, if that tells you anything. :) The service can be a bit slow sometimes; that would be my only real complaint. I recommend the pho and banh xeo, if you have not had it yet!",

But the rice was a little sweet. Because they give you fish sauce and I was just listening to my sister when she said to pour it on the rice and the chicken. Maybe next time I can put a little less on but it was definitely good. The chicken was also pretty good and if you like spicy things you should use the chili paste, in the rice and on the chicken.

I've heard great things about the Pho here but I decided to try the Spicy Lemongrass Chicken with a side of Kimchi. Both were very good and for me the heat was just right right on both dishes. Everything was flavorful and the veggies and chicken were cooked perfect. Doan's is definitely worth the trip.",

Overall, Doan's is solid but if you're in the area I'd rather go to Viet-Thai or Vietnam Grille.",

    "text": "Having lived near Little Saigon in Southern California has spoiled me rotten with super bomb, cheap, and authentic Vietnamese food. So it's almost unfair for me to compare the pho I had here (or anywhere else) to the ones I've had in Little Saigon. But regardless, it's pho, and I have high standards for one of my favorite dishes.   I came here with a very large party - a family reunion/lunch before my cousins wedding.   Everyone at my table ordered the same thing: pho with everything.   During my visit, there were several large parties. This might explain why the soup base was not good whatsoever. The soup was full of MSG because I was extremely thirsty during my meal and went through several cups of water. It didn't have the authentic beefy flavor.   The noodles was too soggy. Not used to soggy rice noodles.   The only thing that was good was the meat. There was a variety and I enjoyed it!   We also tried their spring rolls which were not bad! Pretty standard spring rolls.   We also waited super long for them to bring out the food. Perhaps over an hour?! I suspect that since there were multiple large parties, they probably didn't prepare enough soup and meats. Hence, probably why it took so long. This might also explain why their soup did not taste good since good pho soup base takes more than half a day to make and days to make it even better.   Their food might taste better on other days when they aren't super busy.   If you plan to come with a large party (20+), be sure to let them know ahead of time! This might be the difference between MSG filled broth vs good, authentic broth.   Since there aren't many Vietnamese cuisines around, I would say this is a good option to satisfy cravings and try out Vietnamese food.",

I got the seafood pho and it came with a decent variety of seafood items. Wish there was less (imitation?) crab and more scallops but then again you are only paying $11... Also included were shrimp, octopus (squid? idk) and of course noodles. Actually, so many noodles that I couldn't finish the smaller size bowl.   Good thing I came with a vietnamese friend or else I wouldn't have known to put in soy sauce and hoisin sauce (and Sriracha if you like spicy) although the broth is very flavorful on its own. Also, to site a credible source, aforementioned friend said that this restaurant serves the best pho he's had in Charlotte.  The restaurant interior is pretty bare and service isn't really a thing here but it's not problematic or anything bc people obviously just come here for the pho.",

The avocado smoothie will change your life (beware - it's HUGE!). The spring rolls are very good. Service was not super organized, but it was super helpful. Definitely a spot I will hit every time I come to Charlotte. Area is kind of sketch, if that's an issue for you.",

My dad won't eat any red meat or pork, and the staff was wonderful with that! The spring rolls were served with the traditional peanut sauce which seemed a little less sweeter than normal, which was great for me. The crispy egg rolls were a little over crispy for my liking but they had great flavor. They were served with the fish sauce and a sweet duck-type sauce. We ordered traditional pho, noodle soup with pork and shrimp and a vermicelli bowl. They made my dad a special bowl with shrimp, vegetarian rolls and chicken...for no additional cost! My pho was very flavorful, and not salty at all! I cannot have additional salt in my diet, so eating out has become a challenge...but I LOVE to try new restaurants. We will come back here often!! Oh...and they serve unsweetened tea, my glass was never empty! And the hot tea was great as well!!",

    "text": "I went here from the other Yelp review ( but mostly because of the delicious pictures that were provided). I dined on a Friday around 6pm. The place was nearly empty, other than one other party of 2. When I first walked in, I couldnt help but notice a smell of vanilla cigars(?) I couldn't put my finger on it, but it smelt like someone used to smoke in this facility. (Granted, it could have been the previous owner). I did notice fragrant candles on many of the tables.  The service here was awesome. You could tell it was an establishment that was trying it's best to serve it's customers. I ordered a Vietnamase  Iced coffee and I think the lady-owner came out herself to make sure that it tasted to my satisfaction. The most disappointing part of the meal was that they had NO PHO available. NONE. On a Friday night at 6pm. No Pho. I guess the cooks weren't around and the stock wouldn't be available until an hour later.  Nevertheless I ordered a vermicelli noodle dish with egg rolls, chicken, and pork. It was really tasty. My SO ordered the pad thai (they did let us know beforehand that it was a sweet and sour taste). It was OK. I asked for my food to be wrapped up, but then found out that a different waiter threw it out by mistake. (Honestly, this wasn't a big deal for me because I didn't have alot of food left, but I've never had this happen to me before and thought it was worth mentioning). If this restaurant was less than a 5 minute drive from me, I would definitely give it another chance. However, any Vietnamese restaurant that runs out of pho it's opening month feels like a place that isn't up to par with my standards.",

We were running errands in the area on a very rainy and chilly (for August) weekend and stopped in to try their pho. We were in good company, the restaurant was at least 3/4 full. This affected our service a bit, as it took at least 10 minutes for a server to stop by again - the speed of service didn't detract from our experience, they were apologetic and obviously doing the best they could on a very busy mid-afternoon. I ordered Thai iced tea, and we shared a few appetizers - the rocket shrimp (which seemed to be forgotten for awhile, but were tasty when they finally came out) and the shrimp/pork spring rolls. The real star was the chicken pho, though, the broth was well-seasoned and we left feeling full, warm, and ready the face the rain, and more errands.",

Not sure if going to a Vietnamese place for Thai food is the wisest decision to make.  I've had pad Thai from all around Charlotte, some good, some bad. The pad Thai from here left me wanting a lot more. It was really dry and had a few extra ingredients that I don't normally find in the pad Thai I've eaten. Also, the order had the word spicy in parentheses and it was anything but spicy.  Would go back? Not likely with all of the other choices around town for this type of food",

Stepping inside this, you feel a little claustrophobic as it's smaller than it looks on the outside and more like a train carriage! The menu was a big 6 page menu offering many Vietnamese Delicacies. The staff was quick to come up to our table and he was super fast in spite of handling multiple tables. The food didn't even take long to reach our tables.   The chicken curry vermicelli was the best with a thick coconut based curry/gravy. The fried rice was okay but not the best and the stir fry was a let down- it had way more salt and the vegetables seemed blanched and nothing great about it. Above all the quantity of the dishes was a huge let down and if you are big person, don't even think about having a fulfilling dinner here!   Been tried this restaurant for the first time, I didn't want to try it again - some of the dishes were good and some really bad and quantity was pathetic!",

Every time I go, the flavors are on point and I walk away full and happy.  The broth of the Pho is certainly well above average for the area and the quantity of meat is also well above average for the price.  Get the small if you aren't super hungry, the normal/large should fill you up if you are.  Vermicelli with the fried rolls was delicious.  The only thing that was just okay was the broken rice.  It just did not stand out to me, the flavor was a bit lacking.  After traveling Vietnam for a few weeks, I think the US does Vietnamese food relatively well (though with less variety) and Doan's is no exception.    Service - 3/5 - Nothing stood out, but no complaints.  Ambience/decor - 3/5 - It's in a strip mall, and that's what it felt like.  I generally don't go to places like this for the feel of the place, just the food.  Price - 3/5 - A bit expensive for the type of food, but I think that's common in Charlotte.  Places in Charlotte that serve cheap-to-make food don't usually push enough volume to make a profit unless they charge higher prices.",

I knew I wanted pho but the menu is huge so my boyfriend had a hard time deciding. He opted for the lemongrass shrimp vermicelli bowl. He was gracious enough to let me have one shrimp and it was tasty! The spices were perfect and all of the vegetables tasted really fresh. My bowl of pho was perfect!

This year we've decided that we want to just try new places (for the most part) and Doan's was kind of one of our first new experiences. We arrived about 40 minutes before they were to close so it was fairly dead in there however they were quick to seat us and help us. We started with the meat rolls (beef) and they were really good. They have a homemade peanut sauce that we loved and their hot sauce (not sure if homemade or not) was to die for. We really wanted to take the bottle haha. We got the chicken broken rice and the egg roll, chicken, beef bun. The food was just really good, like comfort food good. It's not fancy but the taste and flavor is just there! Seriously sitting here right now thinking how I'd love to pop in right now and get take away for dinner tonight!! I definitely 100% want to try the hot pot the next time we go as we will most likely become regulars here!! Also side note I got the iced green tea which was a tad too sweet for my tastes (we've been on a no sugar kick) but really grew on me!! He got the sparkling limeade which he very much enjoyed. Basically 4 1/2 stars from us and may bump it up to 5 upon a revisit!! :)",

Was actually hoping to see a long time friend that worked there.   Well...after spending some time searching the menu...decided to have an appetizer of egg rolls....and a main course of grilled shrimp with salad.  Both were outstanding!   The service was great on this quiet mid-afternoon.  A few weeks later...decided to take the entire family!  Everyone enjoyed it a lot.  Everyone was able to get great entrees.!  Even my daughter who has a strict, gluten-free diet.  I have returned a couple of times since going with the entire family.  Always great food...and great service.  I am looking forward to returning soon with one of my number one foodie partners!!!",

They have a pretty large menu, so you should be able to find something to suit your taste. I am vegan and was pleased to see many vegetarian options. I ordered the Singapore Style Noodles. The menu claims it is spicy, but it was not. However, it did have a nice, refreshing flavor to it. On each table, they have Sriracha (hot) sauce, hoisin sauce, soy sauce and ketchup (what? ketchup?). To give my dish some heat, I put some Sriracha on the side.   The interior is fairly elegant for the area and for being a mid-priced place to eat. And being that everything in there is brand spankin' new, it was immaculate. The waiters were super friendly and made helpful suggestions.   Overall, my experience was pleasant. I will return, and that is the best compliment I can pay to a restaurant.",

Mostly because, I live a little south, but also because this restaurant is the closest thing that reminds me of the little restaurants of my childhood.  Specials are located at the entrance, decor is current, restaurant smells right.  All the dishes we have tried are spot on.  I love that you can order just extra noodles for your pho for 2 bucks... it comes with broth and some onion/cilantro.  But I love it because that is pretty much all my kid wants to eat.  My spouse will order a different rice dish each time and everything gets his approval.   Next time I will try the hot pot.",

As important, our lunch was terrific. Everything was really fresh and you could tell. The wraps were JUST wrapped, the pork was JUST grilled, and on and on. The pho with tofu was delicious and a very large helping. The vermicelli rice noodle dish was the best I've had in town. Overall it was a very good experience and one that I plan to repeat often!

    "text": "I have to start this by saying my first trip to Doan's was 3.5/4 star material - slow service but friendly, I enjoyed a delicious veg/tofu pho (in a beef broth) and my dining companion ordered a bun with nicely flavored meats and a pretty good spring roll on top - but my second visit made me wonder.  I was out with my sister when we realized we were hungry, and were in the mood to have a beer or glass or wine with dinner, I couldn't remember if Doan's was serving yet so I called while on the road and a woman informed me they do sell beer and wine, but not liquor. Worked for us. My sister is also a vegetarian and although I couldn't remember if I saw a veg section in the menu, we did find one online so we figured we were safe, and then we arrived... First, our waitress informed us they don't serve alcohol yet. Um, okay? After a ridiculous wait to get someones attention to ask if they had a veg menu supplement, we were informed by a waiter that they used to, but have since chucked it. Great. Unfortunately he was unwilling to point us in any direction or give us any veg friendly options. Okay, back to the menu.  I ordered the rocket shrimp and the bun with chik/pork/springrolls (after they informed me they don't serve the banh xeo listed on their menu). My sister ended up ordering the wonton soup with tofu/veg and the tofu/veg pad thai. My food was fine, but for her, she ended up with a plain wonton soup and the seafood pad thai. If it hadn't taken so long to get the first round of food she would have sent it back, and the waitress was very grateful she didn't want to send it back and that she agreed to pick around the seafood and eat the dish. My sister then asked for a few steamed veggies on the sides to supplement the lack of vegetables in her pad thai, the waitress agreed without issue.   Everything seemed okay, though the veggies arrived in a completely different sauce, but when we got the bill I was a little surprised. Not only did we have to pay for the seafood pad thai that we clearly did not order (and all the seafood was left stacked on the side of the plate), we also had to pay for the side of vegetables! seriously?? It was only a few dollars more in the end, but included with the lack of service (in a fairly empty restaurant), there are just better places in town to get great tasting Vietnamese food with better service. Sorry Doan's, maybe next time.",

I always eat in a big group of friends and family and the hot pot always warms everyone's belly, they have the best selection in meats, veggies, noodles, and meat/seafood paste that cooks when u drop it in the pot. Absolutely delicious soup broth. Quail appitizers is a must try and the mi Xao gion is also a top of list fan favorite \"crispy fried egg noodle basket topped with seafood/meat stirfry in a light grave poured over it gives u a hot crunchy crispy textured dish that's absolutely to die for.

    "text": "Been craving Singapore Noodles, so I finally returned to Doan's!  Well, as always, this dish met all of my expectations. I normally prefer wide, thicker noodles, so it's an anomaly that I love this super-thin and light noodles. Maybe 'cuz it's packed with amazing flavor...with your choice of meats and a ton of veggie varieties. I also had their super crispy egg rolls (which was actually more like spring rolls) and Thai Iced Tea...both good, but not the best I've had in town.  The service was a tad better this time around...but not super-friendly by any means. At least the waitress was fairly attentive, and I didn't have to go out of my way to flag her down (like last time). So no big issue or anything.  What WAS a bit of an issue for me was the AC. I'm hot-blooded, so I just have personal preference for cool air. Well, the place was poorly air conditioned...and today, it was nearly 100 degrees outside! For this lack of customer comfort, I've got to take away a star.  Again, I don't just like, but LOVE their Singapore Noodles...but given that I haven't tried any Vietnamese entree, this review doesn't reflect most of their foods. I'm thinking they MUST be good since their non-Vietnamese dish is THIS good. As for the rest of it...service, ambiance, etc.etc., it was Okay (not great, but not the worst either).  Maybe I'll come back when the weather gets cooler? Also, maybe next time I'll restrain myself from ordering the same thing, and try something else?",

    "text": "Doan's entertained the Yelp International Supper Club the other night to a wonderful overview of Vietnamese food.  My favorite was the Yellow Pancake and while I was a big boy and shared, I truly wanted it all to myself.  So, I'll return, if only for that--I still picture it in my mind and loved the unctuous flavors especially with the fish sauce.  Like our Yelp companion Aaron K states, they served us several other offerings:  \"spring rolls, fresh rolls, yellow pancakes, lemongrass chicken, and vermicelli noodles.\"  There were NO leftovers, lol!  Service was attentive and informative.  I'm pretty much a novice on this cuisine.  The closet I've been to Vietnam was floating down the Yangtze river in China.  The curries, the lemongrass, the sweet grilled meats, the Asian aromas, and the perfectly steamed rice nudge me blissfully back to my trip--it's all so good and not in any way similar to American cuisine.  Perfect.  Looking to wander through another culture without passage to the Far East?  I say \"give 'em a whirl\" and see what other Yelpers like Jacqueline and Anthony T., John H, Tonya P, and Nikki W are yelping about.",

You really cannot go wrong with any of the items here - and I love the fact that you can share a meal with folks that have any food restrictions (vegetarian) without too much hassle.  Their take-out game is strong, however I would recommend dining in.  They have a small dining room, but their staff are always so nice and it's hard for me to imagine taking out pho.  1:  I don't really have a large enough vessel to handle pho at home and 2:  it's so much better when you have it on site and are able to savor the food instead of the big rush we are all always guilty of.    Recently tried their fried tofu with dipping sauce... it was delicious and a perfect appetizer to start a journey through delicious food.  The nice thing about Pho is that you have all the control in adding chili oil and spices.  I love adding the raw/fresh jalapenos to the broth to give it that extra zing on especially cold evenings.  If you are a fan of avocados, definitely get an avocado shake to end your meal.  It's not made to be sweet, but it is super fresh and delicious.",

We also had the Summer Rolls and Vietnamese Yellow Pancake. The Pancake was better than other places I've tried and the Summer Roles are always a deliciously refreshing and satiating appetizer. After raving about this place to my friends, I was advised to quit getting Pho at my other places and just come here because it's the best in the city. If the Pho is really that good, I could have no less than three meals on heavy rotation so I don't even need to try anything else here. But, I will.",

My boo ordered a variety of appetizers for the meal and I tried a bite of his spring roll. The sauce was not as flavorful and I'd remembered and was a little too runny. The roll itself was lacking flavor.

    "text": "I know this is a Vietnamese restaurant but I've been here 4 times and every single time I have gotten the Singaporean rice noodles. It is just that freaking good! The vegetarian version comes with cauliflower, celery, bell peppers, bits of fried tofu, and I think a couple other vegetables. I order it without the eggs, peanuts, and onions. It isn't very spicy and I remedy that by adding copious amounts of sriracha! The refreshing limeade complements this dish perfectly.  Portion sizes are a bit smaller than other Vietnamese places around the area. Also on one occasion we got seated and got our drinks and after that it took 15 minutes for someone to come by and take our order. They were pretty packed that night but 15 minutes was still kind of ridiculous. Oh well the yummy rice noodles made up for it :)",

It's a little inaccessible unless you tend to hang south of Tyvola on South Blvd. We made it in for a late lunch and were thrilled.   The inside is quaint and not over the top with decorations. Just some simple tables. The menu, per usual, is vast and has tons of great options for both meatatarians and veggies alike. We ended up having to take our order to go due to some pressing errands, but the service was exceptional while we were in the restaurant.   We ordered some rice paper rolls. Very standard and quite delicious.   I ordered the standard Pho. Traditional Pho is served piping hot and the beef if typically served raw on top of the bean sprouts or somewhat \"floating\" on top of the broth. It is meant to be stirred in to the broth, thus, cooking the beef, or perhaps more a faux boil. This was a little bit of a shock since we had to get it go and the beef was still raw. No sweat at all! Just a little surprised it was still going to be raw. Knowing is half the battle. (Thanks, GI Joe)  The Pho was AMAZING. Some of the best broth I've had and the veggies were incredible. I absolutely love Vietnamese and Doan's is now way up there on my list.",

    "text": "I really want to like this place. I really do. My friends enjoy coming here rather than going to Saigon Palace nowadays, but after two trips to here, I just think something major is missing.  My first time, our waiter (and I'm assuming the owner) kept rushing us to order. My friend and I shared the small hot pot meal with just about every meat on the menu while my boyfriend ordered the pork chop broken rice meal with an additional fried egg.  When the hot pot came out, some of our side dishes came out and his pork chop plate came as well. We wondered 1) Where is everything else? 2) Where's the egg?  When asked, he aggressively told us that we didn't order that any more sides or the addition of the egg. (I don't know why but the egg was a very big deal; like we were horrible people for asking about it). But we 'ordered' the additional plates to add in... The pork chop wasn't flavored well or charred like it usually is at Vietnamese restaurants. Our meals weren't really fulfilling; we had to order a banh mi to satisfy our hunger.  The second time, I ordered the pho. When it came out, I noticed how large the bowl was and was thinking to myself: Oh god, I'm not gonna finish this. However, when going through it with my chopsticks, I realized they just filled it with lots and lots of broth. Quite skimpy on the basil by the way. However, the flavor of the pho was really really good.  If they just put in a little more consideration, I think this place could be a lot better but as of right now, come here only when desperate. Still better than Saigon Palace though.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place out, hot pot in charlotte, seriously where else can you find a place with hot pot in Charlotte? Buffet Dynasty in Matthews used to have hot pot(very good) but they closed down, ever since then I have been on the hunt!  To start off, the ambiance of this place is pretty decent compared to most vietnamese places. Booth tables along the wall, regular tables in the center. The place looked fairly clean with a barista table at the front of the restaurant. Also the menu is quite extensive. Not many places have singapore noodle, pho, egg noodle, vermicelli, fried rice,  banh mi sandwiches and hot pot. But the trick is to do the vast selection well and not suffer in authenticity and flavor by having a large menu.   First of all, the price is pretty high here. $9 for a bowl of pho? We asked about the difference between small and large, and were told that large was the regular size...well then. My friend ordered the beef pho, she is Vietnamese, and she said it was ok...Mediocre.  I ordered the spring roll vermicelli. The dish itself had no flavor except for the spring rolls. I poured the fish sauce that is supposed to be mixed in with the vermicelli but still NOTHING! By this point, I was desperate and added salt to my vermicelli to make them edible. Anyone of us who has tried adding salt to a pre-made dish at a restaurant knows how disjointed the dish can feel, so I tried adding pepper to make the flavor pop. I have to say, I had vermicelli at an OK place before and the vermicelli I had at Doan's is worse.   For drinks, we ordered the Vietnamese coffee, which was the best part of our dish. It came in a traditional vietnamese coffee strainer. Condensed milk was added to the bottom of the coffee. We were given a separate glass filled with ice to pour the coffee into. Overall, that tasted like a yummy iced coffee, but I am sure the condensed milk contributed majorly to the taste factor.                                                           ********************                                                                      * FRUSTRATION*                                                         ********************                                                            My frustration about this place is the lack of training and coordination of the staffs. When we were seated, someone took our order for drinks. 30 seconds later, another waiter came by to ask us what we wanted for beverages? Ok, I have never had such a mis-step at a restaurant, this is really bad.  The same person that took our order, made ZERO effort to remember what we ordered, even though she wrote it down. When she brought out our food, she was confused where to place the dish because she didn't remember who ordered what. LIttle details like this really takes away from a comfortable dining experience.  The WORST part was, when our checks were brought out to us, the bill was printed in the most UNPROFESSIONAL manner. It was printed on a slip of tiny manual print out. There was NOTHING on that slip of paper except for how much we owe the restaurant. No name of the restaurant, no server, no time, no date, most importantly the item we ordered was NOT on there listed beside the price! I was not so pissed off until I realized that they over-charged me for my spring roll vermicelli. Whoever printed our bills out attempted to write on the check in VIETNAMESE the name of the dish we ordered!!?? Seriously, why did you write it in Vietnamese, this is America! I was so furious at this point that I did not bother to ask them about the over-charge and just tipped the waiter less with the difference they over-charged me. Plus to be honest, she really did not deserve a good tip.   My advice for this place? Only come here for drinks. They have HUUGE jack fruit or avocado smoothie for $3.75. They give it to you in a to go plastic cup that is the size of a regular smooth king cup. If you know anything about Smoothie King, their drink portions are huuge!  Don't come here expecting superb service, you won't get it. I cannot speak on the hot pot, but if you order anything noodle on this menu, it will be a disappointment.",

We were greeted immediately upon arriving and seated right away. The waiter was nice, but he did not understand English. We had to do a lot of pointing at the menu when he took our orders.  Although it was a fairly busy night, they managed to get our food to us in a timely manner. The food overall was delicious. We ordered bun bo hue, broken rice combo, firecracker shrimp, and summer rolls. We did not like the peanut sauce for the summer rolls and had asked for fish sauce, but never got it. The green tea and Thai tea were yummy as well.   If you can tolerate the service, I would recommend this place. I personally would definitely go back, but maybe on a less busier day or just for some take out.",

Prices are reasonable, service is excellent, and the food is fabulous!   Hubby had a chicken dish in curry sauce served over rice while I had the grillers. My dish was great fun because the veggies, meat, noodles, & herbs are brought out individually so that the diner can assemble ingredients to taste and roll them all up in rice paper. Peanut sauce with just the right amount of heat is served for dipping. I thoroughly enjoyed playing with my food - and had even more fun eating it! :-D  We will definitely be going back to Doan's!!!",

    "text": "There is no way I would go back to this place, especially to protect my health.  Who is rating this a 4 or 5 star restaurant?  Is the Vietnamese food in Charlotte that terrible?  This is the only Vietnamese Restaurant I have been to so far in Charlotte, but it was absolutely awful.  I don't live in this city, but I felt obligated as a good citizen to warn others about this extremely disappointing place.  If you have any concern about the quality of food you eat, I would strongly recommend you avoid this restaurant at all costs.  I have been to Vietnamese restaurants all around the world (including Vietnam), and this is definitely on the bottom of the scale to me.  When I walked into the restaurant my first impression was a very unappetizing rotten noxious smell filling the entire room.  Against my better judgment, I still stayed to try a few dishes, as I am  a food adventurer, and I Falsely trusted some previous yelp reviews which were obviously very misleading to me.  Still, I take responsibility that I made a big mistake to stay at this restaurant.  The environment was reasonable beyond the horrific smell, but the service was quite forgetful and not competent.  Communication in English was not easy, and I was not brought some of the things I ordered, like a glass of water I asked for twice... We are talking basics they can not perform here.  Some of the staff was more worried about eating their own meal in the same room when I dined there.    However, the worst part of the meal were the Fresh Spring Rolls with Shrimp and Chicken.  At first, the Chicken looked like nice strips of white chicken breast meat, but either it was spoiled, poorly prepared inconsistent with health department guidelines, or it was the cheapest and worst quality chicken on the market as it had such a terrible rotten and spoiled taste.  After a few bites, I was absolutely disgusted, and decided to stop eating, pay the check, and leave the restaurant.  I did not feel well the rest of the day and evening.... and I could hardly eat anything else until the next day.  Not a good experience I would recommend for others.  I think the people running the restaurant were nice people, but they really need to learn how to delivery quality service, how to invest in and prepare quality food, and most of all figure out a way to keep the restaurant from smelling like a sewer when customers walk in...  at least that is what it smelled like to me when I came there...  I love Vietnamese food, and would love to see more quality Vietnamese food served in Charlotte and all over the country, but not at this poor quality level.  It is a not a good representation of Vietnamese Cuisine....",

Well, all of that great food is all fine and dandy..but only if they get your order right.....  We didn't get our waters until the check came. We never got our fresh spring rolls (luckily we weren't charged). We didn't get our thai tea until our check came - and we noticed we were still charged, thus prompting us to ask about it.   Now I know, it's Asian..and good Service and Asian food usually don't go hand in hand....but when you have some stiff competition less than 1 block away, I think it might be time to pay attention.   I'm kind of at a loss here. 70% of the tables were full, but the restaurant isn't super big.. Three servers should be plenty for that space, but someone they just can't get it right. I met some friends who frequent Doan's often and apparently it isn't an isolated incident.  Either way...the food is still great and I'll definitely return.

    "text": "There are a couple things I look for when trying a new Vietnamese restaurant:  1) Are the condiments for Pho already on the table? 2) Can I get a bowl of Pho for less than $10? 3) Are there other Vietnamese people eating there?  I've eaten at Doan's a couple of times now and the answers to all three questions are \"Yes\". The Pho is delicious and the Pho Dat Biet (Pho \"Special\") comes with plenty of different cuts of meat including tripe which is often left out at other Pho places I've frequented in Charlotte. The broth is very hearty and I imagine it's like slurping the essence of beef.  The appetizers are a bit overpriced for what you're getting but are done well. I've tried the rocket shrimp (Tail-on shrimp wrapped in egg roll wrappers and then fried) and the regular fried egg rolls. A word of warning: give the rolls some time to cool off since the insides will be piping hot! I'd recommend getting a banh mi sandwich as a compliment to your meal instead of an actual appetizer. Doan's makes Banh Mi sandwiches to order. They get their bread and fixin's from Le's. Doan's sandwiches have Vietnamese sausage (cha lua), Jambon, Pate, pickled carrots, cilantro, and slices of jalopeno. I no longer need to drive all the way to North Charlotte to get my banh mi fix!  For main entrees, there are a couple staples that I judge a Vietnamese restaurant by: Pho and Com Tam. Doan's Pho is fantastic as mentioned above and I will definitely make the trip to eat it during the Winter. The Com Tam Dat Biet (broken rice with grilled meats) comes out very well presented and tastes great. The pork has the sweetness and chargrilled taste that I'm looking for.  Service was prompt and attentive. Caveat: I haven't ever been when the place was really busy and am not a serial-water-drinker like many of my friends for whom the waiter might as well leave the pitcher. Then again, I never expect service at a Vietnamese restaurant other than bringing me my Pho and leaving me to slurp in peace.",

Service is fast and attentive, though I should note I've only eaten here when it's sparse.   As per all Asian restaurants, the menu is a novel in itself. Pho and shaking beef have been consistently good. The pork and eggroll dishes were a (3/5), something I'd skip over next time.   Doan's will be my go to Vietnamese joint in Charlotte.

    "text": "On a Monday afternoon I'm ready for a new dinning experience in a NEW Restaurant.  Walking in to Doan's today I am welcomed by one of the young men working here and he actually used the words \"welcome to Doan's\", a young lady seated me and asked if I had eaten Vietnamese before, made a few suggestions and let me look over the menu.  I asked some questions and ordered my first dish!  This IS a REAL Meatball!  EXCELLENT! ! !  In so few words: Doan's Meatballs beats all the others, with one exceptional \"TIE\" for first place!  These skewered Meatballs have the Perfect Flavor and they are the rounded type though they are built small so they are cooked as well as the unmentioned-by-name \"Flat\" version that I also love!  For the Vietnamese Meatballs an easy 5 yelp stars until I can give more... alright 6 yelp stars!  Today was their official \"Opening\" and my waitress said the Chef may not have every dish perfected so she did not strongly recommend the first dish I really wanted to check out!  Spicy Lemongrass with Beef is my first entree!  If I had never eaten at \"Lang Van\" or \"Ben Thanh\" I would say Doan's has the Best!  For now (remember this is based on my \"opening day\" experience) Doan's has everyone \"else\" beat on this dish!  Since I have eaten this dish at five other places I can say Doan's Spicy Lemongrass with Beef is a unique and Very Delicious version!  Tender Beef Stir-fried with white Onion and Carrots (minus the Bell Peppers at my request) served with an almost \"Sticky Rice\" great for showing off my Chopstick skills.  This dish gets 4.75 yelp stars!  The \"spicy\" in \"Spicy Lemongrass\" was flavorful, though not as spicy as I expected and you can request this dish to be spicier!  Next I order Dessert!   If you like Coffee and if you like sweet and creamy Coffee and if you have never experienced Vietnamese Coffee, you are in for a TREAT!  The Brewing process is finished at you table!  When you see the drips stop \"dripping\" push the plunger down to get the last ten or so drops out!  Remove the \"dripper/brewer/canister/filter and stir!  Sweetened Condensed Milk is on the bottom... Drink hot or as I do take a few sips (I have never added anything to this perfect Dessert ANYWHERE!  By taking a taste you can decide if you would like it sweeter or creamier or both - Next, if you like, Pour it over Ice and take a few more sips!  Here is the last suggestion for this style Coffee, my favorite dessert at a Vietnamese restaurant... Place your straw at the very bottom of the ice-filled glass and take a few sips, you should be noticing a warmer (cooler at the top warmer at the bottom of the glass) creamier and dreamier flavor (I'm ready for a nap every time I drink one of these and right now half of the staff of my brain is on strike and the other third is on vacation)!  Vietnamese style Coffee is, I guess easy to get right!  Everywhere I have ordered it I have enjoyed it and it seems almost identical in each restaurant.  An EASY 5 yelp stars!  Second Entree :   \"Bun To\" (Vermicelli) with two sliced Spring Rolls and Grilled Pork!  This dish was GREAT!  Every time I get this dish I like eating some of the components of the dish plain and by themselves, to check out the flavor, then I like dipping each in Fish Sauce and comparing flavors before pouring the fish sauce over everything stirring the dish and eating everything combined... I rate each part of this dish 5 yelp stars, except the pork and it gets very close to 5 stars!  Limeade, Orangeade, Avocado Smoothie and Vietnamese Style Coffee were Fantastic!  No MSG!   The menu has printed on each page \"No MSG\"!  That is Very important to some of you and might be getting MORE important to many of us!  Staff (I met five of them today) are friendly, welcoming, attentive, POLITE, kind and helpful!  An EASY five yelp stars on service!  Smashes the other Vietnamese Restaurants on South Boulevard! !! !!!  I have been to the other places located close by (on South Blvd., no need to name names) each one three times and will probably never review nor return to these \"other places\" because they are not as good!  Doan's Menu Boasts \"Charlotte's Finest Authentic Vietnamese Cuisine\", I'm ready to give them more than a second look because this was great AND it was \"Opening Day\"!  On the inside this place is nice looking!  Nicer than most Vietnamese places and EXTREMELY nice for the neighborhood!  You will probably not want to hang out in the parking lot, though you could be in many rougher areas of our fine City... As always, Be Aware of your surroundings!   LOCATION :  : South of Tyvola, on South Blvd., in the Shopping Center with Food Lion and Family Dollar!",

    "text": "Pretty solid. And definitely hit the spot after a day of much manual labor, and no lunch! Fairy new, and better presentation than your standard Vietnamese restaurant. Good table service, and not a lot of wall art clutter.   I started with the fresh rolls. While they had a lot of filing, I prefer the daintier glass noodles than the thicker white ones they use. And the peanut sauce could have used more hoisin. Wanting something more substantial than pho, I opted for the egg roll and pork vermicelli. Egg roll was sub-par, but the dish came with a lot of meat and plenty of fresh veggies. I like my bowl to be layered; and here the presentation is more like a pie chart of ingredients all atop the bun. Changes the eating experience some, but it still tasted delicious! Not the best I've had; but certainly worth the money, and worth a visit if you're in the area.",

After checking in with the gracious Charlotte CM Ben, we have finally decided on Doan's. No hunger stands a chance to some good old Vietnamese food.  Warning: don't try to navigate to this place with the new iOS map on iPhone. You are going to cause some major traffic accident! It almost happen today LOL! Just pull into the parking lot. No need for U-Turn.  Question: Why is this place still have the \"Grand Opening\" sign? I can see reviews as far back as 5 month ago. Let's take that down unless you want to give me discount on the fresh spring rolls!  By the way, those fresh spring rolls are awesome. So was the vermicelli bowl. But, I don't go to a Vietnamese restaurant without getting some pho. The broth has real clean taste, none of that MSG feel afterward. The noodle was not overcooked and soggy. Like I said, proper pho.  I don't know who this Doan is, but I am now a big fan of him or her.",

    "text": "Solid bowls of pho and a huge menu of other Vietnamese specialties in a clean and kind environment.   The pho tai broth was the best part of the dish - extremely tasteful with the right amount of star anise. I wanted to drink it. The noodles were great and held their consistency while soaking up the flavors. The beef was just average - sliced perfectly thin but a little flavorless. I ordered the small bowl, and immediately thought I should have ordered more noodles when it was placed in front of me, but I couldn't even finish my bowl and left so very full that a drink of water could have made me explode.  We also opted for a Vietnamese iced coffee and Thai iced tea. I've had the Thai style tea before, and this one was delicious and sweet. The Vietnamese coffee was a first, and the woman who served us showed us how to prepare the coffee from start to finish using all the tools. She was so nice, as was everyone else we came across.   When we relocate to the area, I know this will become one of our regular spots. The only thing that could enhance our experience is if they served Banh Mi, which they stopped doing a few months ago. Perhaps if people keep asking, it'll make it's appearance again.",

    "text": "Thanks to George R, Tonya, Jimmy D and even Ben. I had to try this place out. I must say Saigon Palace is still my no# 1. However, Doan's are on point with their customer service. On 3 different occasions, the manager or owner stopped by and actually ask if we need anything or how's everything.  I took a couple of my American friends who never experience Vietnamese food before so I was excited.  I order the summer rolls and crispy egg rolls to start. They both loved the crispy egg rolls and my son also loves it. However, I was hoping for a little less noodles in the summer rolls and at least one more shrimp... The peanut sauce that comes with it was perfect... Better than my mom's.  For dinner, I alway ordered the V2 as my test run. It's the crispy egg rolls & grilled pork vermicelli bowl. Again, I wanted more meat. I'm guessing I'm a big meat eater, lol. Overall, I like it, it's refreshing, the noodles wasn't over cooked. Just enough cucumber, cilantro, picked carrots, topped with their fish sauce makes it a masterpiece. I will order that again. I ordered my son the R5 which is the grilled pork, shredded pork skin, egg patty served with fresh cucumber, tomatoes, julienne carrots and broken rice. They ran out of egg patty which sadden me, that was what I look forward to, wanted to see if its taste like my mom's or it taste better, instead I settle for an over easy egg. The thing I'm most bummed about is the shredded pork skin. I was hoping they would season it a bit more. I went to a few Vietnamese places and I generally order the same thing. My mom make this a lot so I know they have the potential to give the shredded pork skin a bit more flavors. It's a little bland for me. So I wouldn't order it again.  I would tell people about Doan's. They food are good, their decor is way better than a lot of Vietnamese places I been too and their customer service are exceptional!!! Next time I will follow Jimmy's advice and ask for banh mi since its not on the menu..",

I have been to Doan's 3x now, and i have to say i LOVE this place.  Let me start with the staff and restaurant.  Despite your first impressions of the neighborhood and parking lot, Doan's is a nice, clean, pleasant restaurant to walk into.  They are super friendly, and willing to give you suggestions of what you might like.    However, might i suggest to you one of the 3 dishes I've tried there:  Vermicelli Bun To, with the pork, added meat balls and a spring roll.....so stinkin' good.  (I've added a couple pictures of that.)  The Sandwich with the pork (which was amazing!), i crave those things now...and I live in Raleigh!  sad day.  :/   Or the broken rice, which came with Pork, steak, and shrimp.    Everything was excellent.  The thing i like most, is that you can TASTE that it is grilled.  You don't get that at many place.  As far as drinks go, we tried the fresh limeade which was super good.  The Vietnamese Iced Coffee....it's made with sweeten condensed milk...seriously, how can anything be bad that has that in it?!  This iced coffee will make you stop going to the chain coffee house and go to doan's...it is that good.  And if you like it with a little bit of a chocolate twist, try the Lee's Coffee.  But my favorite....SUPER DE DUPER FAVORITE...in fact i would say it is so good, that if you put it on top of your head, your tongue would beat your brains out trying to get to it, is the Avocado Smoothie.  HOLY COW!....i NEVER knew Avocado could taste like this.   I noticed every table was ordering some sort of smoothie, so i asked our super nice waiter what it was and he told me it was a smoothie.  He said his favorite was the Avocado, so i said, BRING IT ON.  And I am soooo glad he did!  Apparently most countries use avocado as a \"sweet\" treat, and this smoothie brings out a whole new side to avacado i never knew existed.   So if you're daring, and want something amazing go for the Avocado smoothie!!!  you will NOT regret it!  (They also have a green bean smoothie....i want to try that one next, but currently i'm so addicted to the avocado, i haven't ordered it yet.  lol.)  If you're looking for good eats, good prices, nice staff, and something different than the local chain, take a trip to Doan's, you will NOT be sad that you did.",

It didn't need any sauce, but a put a little of that plum hoisin on it and wabow your mouth gets hit with a flavor explosion.  This is a great authentic Vietnamese joint that is worth checking out.",

Anywho, loved the taste & they won me over by adding kernels of corn to their fried rice.  I had to try the crispy wontons...another hit! Not like traditional cream cheese filled, just minced meat & veggies.  I tried the grilled-meat fresh spring roll...that wasn't my favorite. It's not nasty, just boring.  As always, I have to top my meal off with a Thai Tea.  An expensive Styrofoam cup worth ($3.50- YIKES)  Unfortunate for my pocket, it too was Yummy so it'll be a staple from now on.

    "text": "I came here due to the review of the day by Tonya P. I have actually heard about this place since its been opened, but I didn't have the chance to come here to eat. So I'm going to put my tastebuds to the rest on this restaurant compared to the other Vietnamese restaurants I usually go to around Charlotte.  So here's the deal. This place used to be Pho 98, and I only had the chance to go there once a very long time ago. Inside, they redesigned the place and the interesting thing I want to mention is that the back is where the cash register is.  Given the menu, I was happy to see such a large option of choices. I ordered their pho dac biet, fresh and fried spring rolls. My mother deviated and ordered one of their Bun dishes. The portion, I thought was a little \"meh.\" I mean the Bun dish, vermicelli is dry with the option of the customer putting fish sauce for a little bit of flavor, wasn't so surprising in my opinion. I feel like other Vietnamese restaurants give you a lot more for your dollar.   I felt as if yeah, sure it's in south side Charlotte and things can be a little more expensive but it still matters to me and how much you get with the extra money you spend. I guess all our money went to our service, which was great by the way... One thing to note was that when you sit down there is no utensils, not to worry it will come (they didn't forget.) After they served the first dish however, I thought they forgot and I was a little confused on why they would serve food before serving anything to eat with. I think they could really spend less time on the utensils if they set it up at each table beforehand.  The Pho that I ordered was okay. The portion was pretty good, a little less than I'm used to, but overall it wasn't bad. The broth was good, tasty and it's True they don't add any MSG, but I just didn't get that satisfied feeling of amazing that I usually get.  Overall, from all the hype of everyone I was expecting godliness that would trump any other Viet restaurant. But, overall I just thought it was \"okay.\" If I could give it more stars it would probably just another 1/2 star, but nothing more... One cool thing to note was that they do sell Banh Mi.",

    "text": "Happy! As a Viet gal, I like!   Food - great and decently priced  Service - good  Place - surprisingly nice and clean, wouldn't have known from the outside.   I am Vietnamese, and I am a picky eater. Being a native-born Houstonian with an abundance selection of Vietnamese food I am used to.. Doan's makes the cut.  What I tend to order -  Hu Tiu Do Bien - Vietnamese clear noodles with seafood (fish paste, shrimp, scallop, and squid) - they normally come in the noodle broth (like pho), but I love mine without the broth. They always serve a bowl of broth on the side, if you want to either dip your fork/chopstick into the bowl, or pour some into your big bowl to get some noodle soup action going.  Vietnamese Limeade - Da Chanh Soda - yummy! So zesty and sugary goodness :)  Why 4, not 5? I wished they had a more wide selection of food. I was craving for Bun Bo Hue - but didn't see it in the list. For those who love spicy beef broth noodle soup dish - try it! But I thought I saw someone's pic that did make them?? Nevertheless, more selection please!  Will def come back and try the Vietnamese Sandwich - banh mi. I always get the Jambon - ham banh mi :) We will see how that is!",

    "text": "I mentioned to my co-worker that I had been jonesing for some Thai food.  She mentioned a place called Doan's that she had been to that had a great dish called Spicy Lemongrass Chicken.  So that's what brought me to Doan's on a Saturday afternoon.  I arrived right around 1130 and the place was pretty empty.  In fact, I was able to park directly in front of the restaurant.  I was seated quickly and a waiter arrived to take my drink order.  I pretended to peruse the menu, but I knew what I was going to order.  When the waiter returned, I ordered the Spicy Lemongrass Chicken and proceeded to fire up the laptop to utilize their free wifi (it is password protected, so make sure to ask the wait-staff).  My food was ready in about ten minutes.  I dug in and the dish was great.  The portion size was good and it had a really nice flavor.  I would eat broccoli all the time if it was Spicy Lemongrass Broccoli!  For dessert, I got the Avocado Smoothie.  I first tried one of these during a visit to Chinatown in Honolulu.  This smoothie is the best smoothie in CLT!  And for only $3.75, it is a fantastic deal (take that Smoothie King).  I don't know the finer points of Asian cuisine and how to differentiate between Thai, Korean, Vietnamese, and Cambodian.  And I don't know what constitutes good Vietnamese.  But I know I received great service and the food was tasty.  And I found the best smoothie in CLT.  I'll be back!",

The pho broth is the best I've ever tried, with complex flavors and the ability to modify per your tastes (lime, jalapeno, sriracha, chili oil). It came loaded with soft tofu and veggies - cauliflower, broccoli, carrot, green onion, celery, mushrooms, bean sprouts. You can get crispy fried tofu if you prefer.   The lemongrass tofu and vegetables was sweet but great.  Next time I'll add sriracha, but spicy is my personal preference.  We basically licked the plate clean.   The Vietnamese coffee was such a treat. A glass with sweetened condensed milk is brought to the table with the coffee dripping down into the glass from a French press-type of contraption on top. The coffee itself is  strong and harsh. Went down like burnt rubber for a newbie coffee drinker like me. But once the milk is mixed in, it's delicious. And even better once it's poured over ice. The calorie heavy sweetened condensed milk makes it an indulgence I'll try to resist in the future, but I know now I'm likely to fail.   I can't stop thinking of this place.",

We were greeted with all smiles from the entire staff. It was a lovely way to start our dinner. Service was very friendly, and quick.   We quickly realized that Doan's may be labeled as \"Vietnamese\" but it is more \"Asian Fusion\". There are all sorts of varieties of Asian food on the menu: Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, etc. Which is great, since that means there is a wide variety of items to order.  My husband and I started our meal by ordering Thai Iced tea, and Tofu Spring rolls. Magnificent way to start the meal! The Thai Iced Tea was one of the best I've ever had: sweet, light, and refreshing. And the spring rolls were to die for. I loved that they had a full bottle of peanut sauce to go with the spring roll as well. I always have a hard time rationing out the peanut sauce on a spring roll, but I could \"glob\" on as much sauce as I wanted on each bite. After an amazing first round, I was thoroughly excited to see what the second course had in store. I ordered the Tofu Pad Thai, and my husband ordered some sort of Jasmine Noodle sort of dish. Both were full of flavor, and original. The tofu was cooked well, with a fried skin on the outside and still soft in the middle. It was one of those meals that I didn't want to end! I just wanted to keep eating such amazing food.   Great vegetarian menu, original and unique dishes, great variety, and good prices! What is not to love?",

The waitress brought my food and it looked nothing like ANY of the pictures I'd seen. However I decided to give it a try. I wasn't pleased with the taste and asked the waitress to try something else. 2 men approached me and one rudely stated \"yes?\".  I informed I did not like my dish and would like to return it and try something else.  He then very rudely & loudly said \"you don't LIKE it?!!\".  I again stated no. The other man jumped in and said the dish still couldn't be returned bc I had tasted it. I have NEVER heard this anywhere!!!!  Usually if a customer is not happy, the establishment does something to remedy it. Not in this case, unless you want to count rudely repeating what I already stated about not being happy with the food.   So much for trying this place out. I won't return again.  Instead I'll go to other similar establishments that don't actually take offense at the fact that it could be possible that someone may not like what was served to them.  Worse $10.77 ever spent.",

Service is pretty fast, food is fresh, tasty and affordable. Can't wait to come back and try more of their giant menu including hot pot which everyone else in the place seemed to be ordered.

Tucked away in a shopping center off of South Blvd., Doan's packs plenty of flavor into a ten dollar meal.  While creating great flavors isn't all that hard to come by with Vietnamese food...cooking everything perfectly is.  Vermicelli...perfect, vegetables...perfect, seasoning...perfect, chicken....perfect.    I used Yelp on this one, and deferred to the tastebuds of my fellow Yelpers.  Spicy Lemongrass Chicken it is.  Sweet, fresh, and tad bit of spice, and this lemongrass was dancing on my tongue.  For those that like a bit of heat in their dishes, you may need to tell them to notch this up before ordering.  Lastly, our service was great.  I will get his name next time I go back.  Very pleasant and came by the table without interrupting.    I'll definitely be back, but it will be hard to try something new.  This review goes to five stars if they can deliver on pho.  Try:  The spicy lemongrass chicken...seriously perfect!

The rice dishes are always a good alternative if you're looking for a quick bite.",

    "text": "After seeing Emeril talking about Pho, on Food Network this morning, I decided it was to check out Doan's. Being a fan of Vietnam Grille and Saigon Palace, I was impressed today, my new favorite spot for Pho. The place is clean and the staff are attentive to everyone. I ordered a combo appetizer, with one egg roll & one spring roll, both great! The egg roll was stuffed with goodness, not one of those with no filling, ha ha. I ordered the Pho Ga, which was amazing. The broth was addicting ad the sides were a great added bonus.  Look forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "I've decided that this is my favorite Vietnamese spot in Charlotte. Don't get me wrong, I like Saigon palace, Vietnam Grille, and even Akahana (over in Plaza Midwood...I know I know, that's more \"fusion-y\" but I digress)  I like Doan's the best because it has everything that I like (and would care to order)and does everything that I like very well. Some restaurants you keep coming back to because of a signature dish. I keep coming back here when I know that I want Vietnamese, but not sure exactly what I'm in the mood for, and not once has it disappointed.   Pho-check Spring rolls-check  Rice paper rolls-check Bun bo hue-check  Bo Luc lac- check  Banh mi-check  Hot pot- check And even more...  I'm not going to get caught up in the debate as to who has the best pho or anything like that. To be honest, everywhere I've ordered pho since moving to Charlotte has made it pretty well. No complaints.  But Doans wins, hands down, because it has it all...for me at least. And all that I've listed above, I've tried and have been happy and satisfied each time.  To top it off, I like the inside of Doans. It's not particularly fancy or especially plain. It's very clean and has a good atmosphere for a casual meal. The service is terrific and everyone treats you very well in there.   It's also a good value too. They have daily specials. (keep an eye out for those) also it's Not too pricey. And personally I think that the portions are fine.  All in all an A from me. Definitely recommend!",

They have improved over the years on their customer service but they still need to work on it.  Other than that, flavorful food, clean atmosphere.",
