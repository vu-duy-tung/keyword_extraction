    "text": "First time visit; will return!  I had never been to Rooster's before but was thoroughly impressed. I took advantage of making a reservation online and called the same afternoon to confirm. When we arrived, the door was opened for us, and the hostess had casual conversation with us and made us priority even though it was fairly busy.   As soon as we were seated, our waitress Leah greeted us and welcomed us to the establishment. She quickly took our drink order and returned to go over the menu with us. She gave excellent dish recommendations and told us how their food is gathered from local vendors and how it is prepared.   The food was amazing. Large, flavorful portions consumed the plates; not once did I think I didn't get enough food. We didn't opt for dessert but they had many options along with coffee drinks too.  The only complaint I have is that it was rather loud. For being an upscale restaurant, with prices being what they are, it was a bit annoying having to almost yell across a small table to communicate with the person I was with.   With the experience I had at Rooster's, I will be returning in the future.",

The pork shoulder rocks and they cannot make enough to go around.  Both individuals were very impressed with the food. It is really amazing, just a great dining experience. I have never been here for lunch but the dinners are impressive.  This is a tasting/sampling type menu. If you want big portions you will not like this restaurant. Of course you can always have big portions by ordering lots of little portions.   The data speaks for the rating. Everyone I have brought here is impressed. We always get treated like royalty.  Roosters is an excellent price/value in the upscale gourmet cusine category. You get what you paid for.",

    "text": "First off, I will say that the food here was VERY good! I went here with five other people last night and we were all really pleased with the appetizers and main dishes. We seriously got a ton of food: cheese, fried oysters, salads, two half chickens, gnocchi, steak burger, dessert, almost everything on the menu. Also can't forget about the wine, the list seems long, but there really isn't a ton a great wines on there. I wouldn't consider myself a wine snob (who would?), but I don't think I would come back for the wine (if you're into that). Food and wine aside, the service was also great. Our waiter was super friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there.  Really the only thing I was disappointed with was where they sat us. We had a party of six, so they sat us in an atrium they share with their neighbors. It was quite. Too quiet. Eerily quite. They had no music playing so our conversation echoed quite a bit. I don't think this would be a problem if we were inside, but it did take away from our experience, slightly.   All in all: I would totally go back just for the food. It was very tasty! :)",

    "text": "Charlotte Yelpers most be a harsh bunch as this is a very high four at minimum so surprised by the 3.5 average.  I have been coming to Charlotte over the last four weekends and been staying and eating around Southpark and this is the best place.  The place is centered around the wood fire open kitchen and everything smells great.  The menu is a nice mix of meat, seafood and vegetables.  Some people might get annoyed at the a la carte nature of the sides but I liked that as I have been to many restaurants and really wanted some dish but did not get as did not like the sides that came with it.  The service has at minimum been good and if anything the servers can be a bit exuberant about all the food though I think for good reason as had the duck, salmon, and special seafood dish and loved them all.  The onion rings were perfectly as skinny and nicely breaded and not too fatty.  The only thing that disappointed a little was the salads which could have used some time in a crisper, a paper towel or a salad spinner as a bit soggy so the dressing did not stick.  They also did not have a True steakhouse style wedge salad.  Liked the beer selection also and the drinks in general were good though cocktails could have been a bit stronger.  In conclusion I have been here three times and likely to return a couple more times.",

I'm so glad we did.  The meal was pricey, but the food was excellent.  We got the choose 3 cheese platter, my boyfriend got the pulled pork and roasted beets.  I got the braised beef rib and roasted turnips.  Everything was excellent.  I would definitely come here again.  The $75 bill was well worth it.    Due to the price, this isn't a place I can afford to go to every week, but we will definitely be back.  Side Note: As we were leaving, we noticed that the bar side of the restaurant has a bar small plates menu, so we probably will be back a little sooner to try.",

    "text": "The restaurant is pretty big and is really nice inside though the exterior is pretty cookie cutter in a strip mall.  The food is served a la carte and we were told by our server that everything from dressings to breadcrumbs is made from scratch in-house. They are a farm to fork concept, with most of it being local. The portions vary so if you're very hungry ask whether a side is necessary.    I had pork spare ribs, slaw, frites the ribs had a great flavor I have no idea what kind of vinegar they were done in but it was very unique! I loved it but I must say the ribs themselves seemed very fatty and not an amazing quality but they were made to perfection!  The fries some yelpers bragged about were just ok nothing special but not bad.  My brother ordered the spice rubbed & smoked wings.  Talk about flavor wow they were smoked to perfection I ate two of them before my brother was ready to stab me with a fork!  The only problem is its 12 bucks for an order of either 10-12 not sure so very pricey!  So all in all a good visit is remember you are paying high dollar for your meal.  For desert we ordered the coconut cake and the & caramel cake w/caramel sauce, praline gelato,  both were really good above average quality and taste. I would say all in all this place is worth your time to give a try I really liked everything about it even if it a little price especially since the ribs had a flavor unlike any i have ever had!",

She said she'd never seen it made there but wouldn't go check to see if it could be made.  Finally, my boyfriend asked her outright to go check.  She, of course, responded with a lot of attitude, and ten no surprise, the drink couldn't be made.  That set the tone for a lot of attitude the rest of the night from her.  I would have given 1 star based on the service, but the bread and water ladies were no nice and helpful, I gave 2.

I had the scallops (4 at $18) and added on the au gratin potatoes ($7). It was definitely enough food and everything tasted awesome. The potatoes were easily some of the best I've had, they had just a hint of gorgonzola cheese.   We split two desserts , the lemon cheesecake with a blackberry topping and the coconut cake. The cheesecake was out of this world, more tart than sweet and just perfectly creamy. It was not a dessert I would normally order on my own but it will be an absolute must when I return!   The only slight downside is you will end up smelling like a campfire, but it is well worth it!",

    "text": "Coincidentally, good friends of mine were passing through Charlotte during one of my moves.  They offered to help and, in return, I offered to take them out to someplace really nice.  We picked Rooster's because (a) it was new, (b) I had wanted to try it, and (c) it was fairly close to my new home.    We were all pretty tired from packing, moving, and cleaning all day (me, most of all), so it felt like a load had been lifted off my shoulders when we walked into the fairly dimly lit Rooster's and were immediately seated without a reservation.  My only shock came when I discovered that the menu items were all offered a la carte, and no one item was all that cheap!  I let that pass, though, thankful for my friends' help and hoping that we'd have an excellent meal.  Turns out, we did have an exceptional meal.  Every a la carte item we ordered was delicious, starting with the soups and breads, and finishing with dessert.   It was about $200 (for a party of four, with drinks) that was well-spent, considering what the cost of movers (and/or my time and patience) could have been.    I'd love to go there again, but with the pricing for each item, it's going to have to be another very special occasion before I return.",

    "text": "Wow - such a special treat! We didn't have reservations so when we walked in (Friday night), the only seats they had available were at the Chef's table. We took them and to our surprise had an absolute blast!   From the moment we sat down we were taken care of by the most professional and attentive group of people. Watching as your food is being made right in front of you is such a delight. Jake from the kitchen was awesome, he greeted as soon as we sat down and spent the next 2 hours checking in on us and giving us little facts about the place, the history and the foods they were preparing. Every plate leaving the kitchen was a beautiful and simple piece of art. You could tell that the team cared about the food they were serving, if something didn't look right, someone was always there to add the extra sauce or to sprinkle the plate with the missing garnishes.   We had the mussels from the local menu - the sauce and ciabatta were crazy good. They make all of their bread in-house and you can taste the freshness. We moved on to the grilled salmon and the spit fire roasted chicken with pan fried corn and potato fingerlings and enjoyed every single bite. I have been craving a place like this - a place with fresh, local, organic foods (supporting our local farmers!) prepared with care and incredible attention to detail. The perfect portion sizes give you the opportunity to try a nice sampling of different options and even leave room dessert - try the coconut cake with an irish coffee. They have a nice wine list which included a few favorites of mine from back home (Duckhorn, Jordan and Pali). We won't be feeling guilty about eating here a few times a week, a great local spot!",

A place that has food like this should not use chefs who seem dependent on pepper. All of the flavors of the dishes (strip steak, peas, spinach, onion rings) were completely lost due to the amount if ground pepper. Another small thing, but they seem unable to produce a glass of Diet Coke that isn't flat or taste like an odd mix between regular and diet. The staff has been great - other than the guy who breezed by and asked how we were enjoying things but didn't care about our response as he kept going and responded as if we gave a glowing \"yes\" in reply.   I will be sticking to the Uptown location and trying out the Ballantyne location. This is my last visit to this location.",

    "text": "Man-o-man!  I really do like this place.  We went with another couple for dinner, later took 97 year old dad there for lunch and two more times for dinner and lunch.  Very consistent and very good.  Sad to report that I have yet to try their namesake wood-fired chicken.  Too many other interesting and nice menu options that push chicken lower on the list.  I will eventually get there.  I can't remember the name of the dish...sorry, but it was a mix of mushrooms and chicken (ooops!) in a baking dish like a stew.  Rich, creamy and delicious.  And there is magic in the mixed mushrooms served as a side or appetizer.  The short rib is so yummy that you eat slowly to extend the ecstasy.  On the mashed potatoes!  Aaaaaaahhh!!   Salads, from side to main course are generous and their dressings are made in-house so are wonderful.  Onion soup is as it should be:  rich, cheezy and hot.    Service is great.  Wait staff have personalities, not over-done, and relate to the people at the table.  And they are more than willing to arrange substitutions (within reason, please) and accommodate likes and minimize dislikes.  And when there is an issue, they simply replace the item and don't charge you.  Nice.  They do a good job here, so give lunch a try, and come outside of prime time when it is not so crowded.",

I worked in a restaurant for 5 years and I've never seen such an organized & professional staff, they have two hostess at the front, 3 managers on duty, and a stacked kitchen staff this definitely makes your experience that much better! After dinner my mom said \"we are coming back tomorrow!\" Can't wait to try more food on their menu!",

So you look for some of the top new restaurants, and find Roosters, and Yelp gives it four stars with some glowing reviews and you're like... All right! It's 9:15, everything closes in 45 minutes, I'm in South Park, and wouldn't mind a nice sit down meal... LETS GO TO ROOSTERS!!  Siggggggghhhh. Ugh. Charlotte... So disappoint.   I dunno. Maybe they were having an off night. I mean it IS Tuesday night. Perhaps expectations were wrong. The place itself, it's gorgeous. Really dug the look of it, the laid back, classy atmosphere, the wall of cock. But maaaaan. That food was OFF.   We ordered the chicken liver mousse, which was covered with a rock hard layer of schmaltz that we had to drill through. I dunno what they put in there, but the seasoning was just off. Maybe sherry?   Then the main dishes. The bbq pork shoulder. I don't understand. Why did you cube the pork like that? What was the point? And the slaw. It was warm. Warm slaw isn't a good thing. In fact it's a bad thing. A harbinger of pain to come, of frequent dates with the john and childhood summers filled with church bbqs, and Cole slaw left out too long in the sun. The fries were good though, a lot like the fries you get at Five Guys.   We also ordered a couple of sides. The spinach was whatever. The Mac and Cheese? Have you all not had Mac and Cheese before?? The succotash was good, corn was sweet, well seasoned. Beans were a bit mushy, but maybe that's how they like it in Charlotte. And the fried chicken of the woods. I ate about five pieces before realizing that it wasn't actually chicken. Maybe cause I figured it was dry and tasteless and that's just how it was cause the rest of the meal didn't have much flavor either and that was probably the problem.   THE SEASONING WAS ALL OFF.   Like it wasn't consistent.   Mac and cheese? BLAND Wilted spinach? BLAND (did you all use unsalted butter to wilt the spinach??) Fried chicken of the woods. Bland and blah. Even the ranch needed salt.   The pork was actually well seasoned. And the succotash slightly over seasoned, little heavy on the salt.   But seriously. Maybe the cooks were all in. Rush to get home and they forgot to salt everything. But you go to a nice restaurant, spend $90 for two people, you expect a little consistency between dishes. It shouldn't taste like we ordered from five different restaurants.   But like I said, maybe an off night. If not, God bless em and God bless Charlotte because three stars is being generous. Seriously. Top 30 restaurants in Charlotte? Y'all out of your damn minds.",

I was going to order one of the specials they had on the menu that night but they ran out :( so I settled on the wings! Not that it's a bad thing because they are really good!

My boyfriend doesn't even like coconut and even he loved it. It's worth it to visit just for the cake!  The service is good here. I like that they take their time. But I could see how some people feel it is on the slow side. There was no need to make a reservation when we went- we walked in on a Monday night and were seated immediately!

Though it was not my favorite dining experience, the manager came by personally several times during the meal to check on the taste and experience, as well as delivered part of our order to the table himself. Kudos to this gentleman for caring about his customers, that did not go unnoticed.   The waitress noticed us taking time to look at the menu and when we presented questions to her she states \"this must be your first time\". Well, yes, but that should have probably been asked upon our seating and her introduction. We gave her the benefit of the doubt but she performed her job in a flustered manner on the evening that we dined.   For taste, I must say the meal was only mediocre. I had the quarter chicken with a side of green beans (most items are a la carte), my boyfriend had the steak burger. The waitress did not understand our original order and never brought our second side, which was going to be the pan fried corn. Flavor lacked and I found myself wishing there was a sauce to dip the chicken in. Green beans had a watery sauce on them that in the end just watered down the spices that they tried to flavor with. Pricing is higher than what the quality of the meal deserves. But to each their own, you should always try a place at least once.   To leave you with a positive, the summer drink menu has a pineapple cocktail on it, this you should try, it was delicious.",

The menu had many choices and I selected three offerings, the seared scallops, the assorted mushrooms, and the pan fried corn. Each and every dish was rich and flavorful and far exceeded my expectations.  The wait staff was attentive, my water glass was always full and I was consistently checked on to see if the meal was to my liking.  I left the restaurant full and satisfied with plans to return again. Next time I may try the bar which had several interesting chalkboard specials such as quail sausage,  venison bangers and mashed, and duck wings. Very Intriguing.",

We are using a list of Charlotte Magazine's 25 best local restaurants as a guide and Rooster's is near the top - so we gave it a whirl. We loved it. From the taxidermy roosters on the walls to the open kitchen, dimly-lit ambiance, and excellent food, what's not to love? We didn't have a reservation (which I'd recommend) so we sat at the bar (this is often our preference anyway so it was perfect) - we enjoyed excellent wine, ate the cured duck and creamy Chapel Hill cheese to start, and finished with gnocchi, pan-fried corn, and BBQ chicken. All-in-all an excellent meal made better by an excellent ambiance. We will definitely go back!",

Minus 1/2 star; I had higher expectations for the wines by the glass. Its like they tried to hard to be diverse and missed a little. Other then that the items on the menu were great.   We ordered the Onion Soup, the arugula salad, the brussel spouts, hanger steak, and the pumpkin gnocchi. My favorite was the gnocchi. It was perfectly cooked light and delicate. Those 5 items plus two $9 glasses of wine ended up being a bit over $40 each including tip. Definitely worth it. Food was done in what I like to call \" gormetey\" as in; every dish tasted unique and different. The only thing that I didn't look, ie: the other minus 1/2 a star is because the onion soup was a bit salty. It was amazing just a bit more salt then I would prefer.   I would definitely recommend this place and its the type of place I would take my boyfriend or out of town visitors. Give it a try!",

    "text": "Not impressed with this restaurant.  The calamari appetizer was greasy and the server didn't ask why we had her take away an almost full serving of the dish.  There were two Grouper specials on the menu, one was already sold-out.  According to the server they only had 4 orders available to begin with; this tidbit of information left us with the impression that the \"special\" was nothing more than a way to dump food scraps on customers at a high price.  The other Grouper dish was overly salted otherwise it could have been tasty.  The grilled shrimp entree was unimpressive and looked very lonely on a large plate with no accompaniments, as did the roasted chicken breast.  As a party of three we all walked away disappointed and felt the offerings were over-priced. We are reside in the Washington DC region and the SF Bay Area and are accustomed to pricy restaurants and don't object when the food is good.",

It definitely smells wood-fired, which I found quaint and enjoyable.  The one thing I did not find enjoyable was the \"Wall of Roosters\".  I get it--the name is Rooster's; but McDonald's doesn't have shrunken Ronald heads all over the wall. It was a tad weird--and a few were staring at me!  I was going light, so I just had the Arugula and goat cheese salad, which was good. It was a salad--Mom won't hear about it, but I would order it again.  My boss had a burger, which he described as \"fantastic\" and had the potatoes au gratin as a side, which was a recommendation from our waitress.  He loved those, and was moaning through most of lunch.    Our server was friendly and helpful, and since we were two of the only customers there, she was very generous with the water and bread.  I would definitely go back to Rooster's, and look forward to trying something more substantial next time!",

Our server, Maurice, was very friendly and helpful. Good, but somewhat limited, draft craft beer selection that seems to rotate. They have more options in bottles. Falafel wrap was great and was a generous portion. My husband ordered the quarter chicken and enjoyed it (wasn't sure it was quite worth all the hype, though).  The side of beets was fantastic!",

Either the folks in Charlotte don't know a great restaurant when they see it, or it's just a little too southern for the New Yorkers in Charlotte. The food was exceptional, the service was friendly and knowledgeable, and the hosts were incredibly nice. I enjoyed sitting at the stools by the open kitchen, and everything that emerged from the kitchen looked so inviting. I had the roasted duck wings with delicious chili aioli, and the quarter barbq chicken. The chicken was tender and moist, and I enjoyed the sauce. I felt that the chicken could have been even better had it been smoked. The fried corn was excellent as an accompaniment. There were so many things I wanted to try on the menu, and I think I shall go back for the succulent looking grilled burger. I loved it!",

    "text": "This is 3rd time I ordered something to go from here for lunch but the first time I really decided to say something because usually I just get a side item to go. 1 piece of chicken and a small side order of succotash should NOT cost $19.50 including tax, Quality of food is good but chicken honestly no better than roasted one from grocery store except it does have an interesting smoke flavor to it. The lunch menu was no cheaper than the dinner menu & just had a few less choices. The 1/4 chicken was $11 & 1/2 chicken was $14- that is without even 1 side!! I thought for that price that the servings would at least be more than plentiful but that was not the case. Yes, it was plenty for one person but the price is just outrageous, truly. My suggestion would be to have combination plates nor significantly increase serving sizes to at least give the impression of value. Also not impressed with having to wait at bar in order to get to go menu.There is curb side pick up but I preferred to go in & get it & not pay a tip for simply getting take out.",

I ordered the gnocchi with duck confit. When it arrived I was shocked by the size of it. It looked like an appetizer. I couldn't believe they didn't at least try to beef it up with more spinach and onions! When I bit into it I was in heaven. It was incredible. Perfect tender pieces of gnocchi and wonderfully flavorful duck in a sauce that I was scooping up with bread when I was done. My only complaint-not enough(although that's a big complaint). If they presented their dishes as small plates that would be one thing, but I placed my order expecting a nice sized plate of food(not a huge amount but a bit more than I got). That being said, I would return to rooster's,I just might eat a light snack before I leave home.",

I love their: oyster salad (fresh and non greasy oysters), burger and fries (great fries), fried chicken livers (if you do not like liver try theirs it is soft deliciousness encased in a perfectly fried batter). As far as service goes I have only experienced professional service and on more than one occasion I remarked how well run the place was.  I tend to have lunch here so my comments may not apply to dinner; at lunch it is a good buy (entrees about $8 - $12). For dinner try Zebras, Carpe Diem, Barringtons, Gallery all of which offer an upscale dinning experience for an upscale price. Sorry for any misspelled names.",

I always start with the arugula salad, then either the veggie plate or the spit fire turkey sandwich (best sami in town), butter beans, and the coconut cake. OMG the coconut cake has a creamy vanilla englaise they drench over it. It is so good. About the butter beans. This is a big thing for me. If you've never had them you need to try them. They are amazing and so good for you. This is something Rooster's does so well. If you have a vegetarian in the family you need to come here. Roasted beets, carrots, corn, whatever is in season. Then there are the meatetarians. They will be happy too because Roosters butchers their meat in house weekly. Basically, if I have a group of people with different tastes I need to please I come to Roosters. Everyone will be well fed at a reasonable price, and leave very happy.",

My arm got tired from flagging down the waiter and it took us an hour and a half to get in and out due to this. We used a Groupon and Roosters added 20% to the bill in gratuity.  I get it that people tip based on the reduced price which is completely cheap and lame and you should be smacked in the head and publicly embarrassed for doing so.  But paying 20% for terrible service didn't add to the expereince.  At the Groupon price we paid $45 out the door for 2 entrees, 1 beer (great selection!!!!) and 2 desserts and that was fair.  It would have been $65 without the Groupon and that is WAY too much for lunch. The french fries were the best thing we tried.  FANtastic.",

This time around I ordered the roast chicken wrap.  I was planning on ordering something different, but once the server explained to my husband what was on it, I decided to order it too.  Put pickled red onions on anything and I'm in!  The wrap was good, but close to being over-seasoned.  It comes with a side of fries, but you can get a different side for $1 more so I ordered the onion rings.  I'm glad I did - they were great.  Cut thin, almost like onion straws...quite addictive.    Service was excellent and the food came out FAST.  Almost too fast! I wish the server knew a little more about the craft beer selection.  When asked what the Highland Seasonal was, she responded that she wasn't sure but she knew it was good because the brewery planned to start making it available year-round.  Rather than wait for her to check into it, I simply ordered something else.  No biggie.  I love the atmosphere of this restaurant - laid back and cozy.  I'm looking forward to going back again soon!",

I read the reviews from other Yelpers, which made me hopeful.  Unfortunately, the dining experience I had with my girlfriend last week was simply dreadful.    We ordered the fried green tomato appetizer, and it was truly ordinary.  The tomatoes were breaded too heavily, and there wasn't anything particularly flavorful on the plate.  For dinner, we ordered the flatiron steak, the half chicken, green beans, and cauliflower.  The meats were just dreadful.  The steak was undercooked, and it was served cold.  The chicken was warm when it was brought to the table, but it was so bland that it was not worth eating.  Candidly, a rotisserie chicken from the Fresh Market is much, much better than the chicken they served us here.  The vegetables weren't memorable in any way.  The beans were luke warm and a bit oily.  The cauliflower's sauce/flavoring was simply not enough to make it enjoyable.  We skipped dessert, for there seemed to be no point in prolonging the evening.    While our waitress was quite good, the bartender we encountered inside the restaurant was clearly working in the wrong area of the restaurant.  When we asked him about some of the wines that they offer by the glass he told us \"I don't drink wine\".  Really?  Then why in the world are you working the bar?  I found that to be a total turn-off.   I am really sad that Rooster's seems to have such terrible food.  The inside of the restaurant is really neat, and the staff (with the exception of our bartender) was friendly and competent.  We won't be returning.",

The waitress did her best sales job and told me about the beautiful scallops that looked like \"toasted marshmallows\" when they came from the oven. She didn't tell me that they were miniature marshmallows, three of them to be exact. For $18.00 I got three scallops with no sides. The best part about the meal was the steamed green beans ($5 extra) and the bottle of wine. Hard to mess those up.

First of all, I find it more than a little off putting when the first words out of the waiter's mouth is \"Would you like bottled sparkling or still water, or tap water\"?  It's just plain annoying and seems to suggest that you're cheap if you don't spring for bottled water.  What it really says to me is \"while you're here we'd like to wring as many dollars out of you as possible and if we have to make you feel uncomfortable while doing so , so be it.  We went for brunch today, and I was going to order the open faced serrano ham and cheese sandwich with mornay sauce until my waiter warned me that the portion is very small and that I might want to order some additional side dishes if I ordered it.  Given that he must have weighed 140 lbs soaking wet, I took him seriously and changed my order to the Southpark Fry:  duck confit hash, fried oysters, fried egg, and duck jus.  Sounds delicious, right?  It was merely OK and for $14 there should have been more than two small fried oysters and one ounce of duck confit.  There were more onions than anything else in this dish.  If this was a large portion, the ham and cheese sandwich must truly be tiny.  My wife had the \"steak burger\" and again we were annoyed at the small portion.  It was the size of a slider and completely unremarkable.  If you want to spend $40 on lunch and still come away hungry, Roosters is your kind of place.",

Mac & cheese dry and salty -- avoid. Pan seared grouper was one dimensional, salt only with a tough and somewhat crispy skin. Bread basket contained cold sliced bread. Ordered salmon salad, waiter returned saying they were out but he could add a piece of warm salmon for $4. Huh? Jim Noble, come in and fix your restaurant.",

Had lunch there Wednesday and between my pork spare ribs, daughter's pasta and wife's spit-fired chicken we were once again pleased. We ate our roasted veggies too: corn and beets that day. Especially appreciated young manager Yuri stepping in to assist the wait staff...how did he know? He used to be a server, the second time we have experienced this connectedness (Steve is always great!) and proud of Jim Noble's staff promoting from within. Sometimes I go just to breathe the wood-fired air but the food is always excellent and we feel at home when we go!",

And, I have to say the service has improved.  The food continues to not disappoint. I have always been a huge fan of the pizzas, but have recently branched out and tried a few new items. The chicken, of course, is always great, but I have enjoyed the duck, shrimp and flounder specials and most recently the beef carpaccio. Don't forget to ask for bread upon arrival, so fresh and served with an olive oil and balsamic blend, love!  When the weather is nice try to grab a table outside, if not, enjoy the wall of Roosters.",

    "text": "I visited this restaurant just a few days ago to celebrate my birthday. I was in town from Winston Salem visiting friends and there were so many restaurant options to choose from. I decided upon Roosters after reading many positive Yelp reviews and they did not steer me wrong! The first thing you notice about Roosters upon walking in is the smell. OMG the food aroma was so enticing. I knew right away this was going to be a good experience. The restaurant was beautifully decorated and the music was awesome....a mix of older soul music. They had this really cool wall of Roosters to your left and the cooking area was right in the middle of the restaurant so you could see what was going on. We started with drinks. First, I ordered the pineapple crush (I think that's the name). I didn't like the drink but I heard it was pretty popular. The waiter immediately whisked it away and returned with my replacement, which was called Bourbon something or other... Sorry I forgot to write it down. But it was absolutely delicious. We started with an order of calamari for an appetizer and the free bread that came when we sat. It was super good and big enough for the three of us to share. Everything here is ala carte and the sides are big enough for two people to share. I ordered the scallops, my friend ordered the hangar steak and my son ordered the burger and fries. All three were extremely good! We also ordered three sides to share... The wilted spinach, mac and cheese and grilled corn. They were so good that I couldn't even pick a favorite!!! Finally, they offered me a complementary dessert since it was my birthday and I went with the coconut cake. It was almost like a coconut tres leche tower of yummy goodness. Moist and Rich and enough for the three of us to share. They even put a little candle on the top. The service here was top notch. Everything came out quickly and cooked to order. The waiter was on point and never let our drinks empty. Several others (possibly managers) even came around to ask if we were enjoying our meal and needed anything. If I lived in Charlotte, I would visit this place as much as possible. It's an upscale vibe but not one that you have to wear a shirt and tie to dine. I highly highly recommend this restaurant.",

Their food style and decorations are like an upscale Cracker Barrel (minus the breakfast) - Half Chickens, Meatloaf, Pork Chops, Shrimp & Grits plus other Southern staples like pimento cheese appetizer and fried oysters! I'm a native North Carolinian, so these items please me greatly! The decorations are rustic farmhouse antiques like old butcher stands & taxidermy Roosters. And the food is served in small cast iron platters to add to the rustic charm. Today we went family style and ordered all of their most popular menu items. All of which were delightful and the seasonal gelato: Peppermint stick was the perfect finish to our feast..",

The duck wings were double fried, served in a thick, rich, and a (little too) sweet sauce, tossed with sesame seeds. Definitely had an Asian flavor. The cauliflower was charred and nutty, the yellow/green olive oil adding a great vegetative flavor. Mussels were served in a delicious broth, I used the crusty bread and a spoon to sop up every bite. The succotash was buttery with sweet corn and beans. Cocktails have some amazing combinations of interesting liquors that I even had to ask what they were.",

Our waitress was Kelby and she did a great job going over the menu, making suggestions and giving us time to decide and order.   We ordered quarter roasted chicken, fried oysters, and 2 bbq meals along with onion rings and green beans (called haricot verts) and it was all good. The chicken is what I had and it came in a small cast iron pan and was super moist and seasoned well. The 2 guys ordered the bbq, and I had read in another review that the meat was cubed, but it still seemed strange. It wasn't as plentiful of a portion as I would've expected.  Hubby said the flavor was good but nothing spectacular.  The fried oysters were a hit and the onion rings were thin and crispy, my favorite!   We ordered 2 desserts to share, the coconut cake which I HIGHLY recommend and the chocolate mouse pie which ai didn't sample. The coconut cake was light, creamy and just really good!  The price points matched the Southpark area, the decor was adorable and the ambience was casual but still super nice dinner night out for us.   We would recommend it!",

My wife chose the roasted duck breast which she said was excellent. Very moist, very tasty, truly delicious. I chose the half barbecue chicken and it was awesome. Super moist, very tangy, really easy to eat with knife and fork. Yum and a bunch of it went home.  For sides, we chose three veggies to share - roasted beets, Yukon puree (really, mashed potatoes) and steamed spinach. All were great.  No dessert today.

Great atmosphere with the Rustic Vibe and open concept kitchen..   our server was phenomenal giving us the right amount of time to decide.  His suggestions and concern for our allergies were his number priority.   The food??   Phenomenal.  I ordered the Pork Loin special and my wife the Duck. The kids ordered the Burger, the 1/4 Chicken and the Bisque.  For sides we had the potato's, grilled corn, beets and fries.  Everything was absolutely delicious!

It's easy for everyone at the table to try each other's dishes. Warm and welcoming atmosphere. Great service. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "This place was wonderful!   My boyfriend and I went for a late dinner last night and loved it. We waited about 20 minutes for a table but it wasn't too bad, we grabbed a drink at the bar and then the table was ready.   First of all almost everything is A la cart so know you're going to spend money. We started with the charcuterie and had them pick what was on it. I'm so happy we did that we got some things we wouldn't have picked ourselves. My boyfriend got the chicken which of course being called roosters they're known for. He got the chicken BBQ style which had an Indian influence not a traditionally BBQ but he really enjoyed it. He also got a side of Mac and cheese...which was amazing!   I got the mussels  which came with toasted bread and it was salty and delicious. I got a side of fire roasted beets and onion rings. Both were amazing.   All in all the experience was delightful and our server was so friendly and helpful. We would go back in a heartbeat.",

This worked to our advantage with stellar service and impeccably prepared food.  Lori's french onion soup was excellent with a deep, umami flavor.  My order of chicken livers over polenta was, quite frankly, one of the best riffs I've had on this overlooked,  rustic culinary treat.  I kicked it up a notch with a 3 minute poached egg which ran all over the plate.  Mmmm.  Perfect.  I paired it with a glass of prosecco to give it a little elegance.    Other than smelling like a campfire when I arrived home (which I liked), I was happy we visited.  A return is in their future.",

I don't generally bother writing restaurant reviews, but upon recently learning that Jim Noble--the owner of Rooster's--actively supports the far-right, discriminatory group Alliance Defending Freedom, I felt I couldn't remain silent. Guess what? You have the freedom to spend your money at any variety of restaurants in Charlotte that have better food and are owned by decent humans who operate their businesses ethically. If you care about not supporting a bigot, then there are plenty of other wonderful restaurants to patronize. I'll never set foot in another Jim Noble establishment* again.    * King's Kitchen, Rooster's, and the soon to open Noble Smoke",

    "text": "Roosters is an upscale new American restaurant with a very chef-driven menu and a big wink (check out the wall of taxidermy roosters on the wall). To start, I had the blood old fashioned with a bourbon-soaked cherry.  It was a bit sweet, but very delicious!  My boyfriend had the bourbon in the orchard cocktail, which was also very good! We also got the charcuterie board, with five choices that I've completely forgotten (duck liver mousse, an excellent aged gouda, a fennel salami, ???).  All of the charcuterie options were very thoughtful and we devoured the board in minutes (we're piranhas, basically).  For dinner, I had the hangar steak, my boyfriend had the duck breast.  Our other tablemates had the veal gnocci, scallops, salmon, and the smoked chicken wings.  Everyone cleaned their plates!  For sides, we had the Carolina gold rice (buttery in the best way), bacon-braised collard greens (I went back for thirds and fourths #nogreensleftbehind), potatoes au gratin (absolutely the best I've ever had), and asparagus (can't go wrong!).  We were pretty full, but we still peaked at the dessert menu (the snickerdoodle blondie sounded amazing).  Service was impeccable, our waitress was delightful and incredibly knowledgeable and helped steer us while reviewing the menu.  The owner (or manager?) stopped by our table several times to check on us.  All in all, we felt taken care of and we left with full tummies and a great experience.",

    "text": "I heard that this was one of the new trendy places in Charlotte but it is highly over rated.  The prices are high considering the quality and the portion size of the food.  The 1/2 chicken is $13.00 and does not come with anything.  The taste was bland to say the least.  The roasted take-out chickens from Wal-Mart are more appetizing and the mashed potatoes from Bo-Jangles are better too.   It is not child friendly either since there is no menu for them which is a little unusual considering it is a casual restaurant and the family demographics of Charlotte.  I ordered chicken fingers for my daughter for $5-$6 and then added an order of fried for $5.  Horrible value.  The service was disappointing too.  We arrived well before the Saturday night rush and had a reservation and asked to be seated in a booth since there were two open booths.  The hostess said that we needed to request a booth when we called and that it was reserved for someone else.  I have never heard of such a thing for a casual restaurant.   I know that the chef has done well but I would not recommend Roosters to anyone.  There are many better choices  in Charlotte for far-less money and better quality.  I would not even call it a Tapas style restaurant either.",

Then our waiter, who had either NO training or the worst sense of timing ever, strolled by to take our order after we'd been waiting, oh, 15 minutes or so. The food was bland, arrived haphazardly, was cold more often than not...you get the idea. And when we were ready for the check? You guessed it -- another 15 minute wait.

We asked twice to have the basket refilled and it took a bit. The bread is made fresh in the ovens daily, and it's outstanding.   This is a must place if you love wood fired food.",

Went with a coworker for a later dinner.  I ordered the mussels, arugula salad with fresh peaches, and the shishito peppers.  Unfortunately since we were there a bit late they were out of the peppers ordered the heirloom tomatoes with micro basil instead.    My coworker ordered the quarter natural chicken, au gratin potatoes(which are to die for), and the roasted red kuri squash.  Again because we were there later, they were out of the au gratin potatoes, she ordered the Mac and cheese instead.  Everything was amazing.  I love the fact that they use local ingredients. The food is fresh and has so much flavor.  The presentation is wonderful.    Some reviewers feel that this place is a little expensive.  I think you get what you pay for and this is definitely worth it.  A True dining experience.  I will definitely be back when I am in town.",

I went there for a business lunch (I live in NYC)... got a cobb salad and the whole thing was deconstructed... like lettuce in one part, cheese, bacon, all like 3 inches away from each other on the plate.

Did a quick google search for nearby restaurants and Roosters popped up, soooooo glad it did!!! I called the restaurant, not confident that they would be able to accommodate a party of our size last minute (and on a weekend!) but the hostess assured me that she was going to PERSONALLY put our table together and that when we arrive we would be seated immediately- I thought \"Yeah right\"... boy I ate those mental remarks by the pound..  it was as she said, beautifully arranged and readily available for us to be seated.  The whole staff was friendly and hospitable, I mean the WHOLE staff was!  A pleasant change from what we've encountered from similar dining establishments in the South end.. but the \"icing on the cake\" was our server, Tommy.  He went above and beyond to ensure that our experience was nothing less than phenomenal and he exceeded every expectation from potentially at times, fussy customers.  The food and the Wine list (our teenager called it the wine glossary lol) only magnified the experience... beautifully cooked med rare burger and hangar steak, to the delectable sides and the amazing desserts... I'm afraid that Rooster's has raised the bar for its nearby competitors, to them I say good luck .. Tommy and Roosters have earned our future business - we have become quite spoiled at Roosters and will make sure that all our friends and family come to dine here!!! Thanks so much for the wonderful experience",

We like the bbq chicken and the wings which have always been good but the sides are skimpy. We like the panfried corn but it is  $7 as a side and it was  SMALL portion. To be truly satisfying for two you would need two orders and I can't see paying $14 for some corn! I appreciate the whole farm to table philosophy of the restaurant but people also like to think that they are getting good value as well. I never feel that way when I leave this restaurant.   A previous reviewer stated you should bypass Roosters and go down the street to Bricktop and I would have to agree with that sentiment.",

    "text": "I've worked in the restaurant industry for 15 years, four of which have been spent here at Roosters... hands down, one of the BEST restaurants out there. The food is simply amazing. I always tell my guests to start with the charcuterie board. The selection is great and it's always served with mixed olives, crostinis and a housemade black grain mustard (goes the best with the duck ham). For dinner, you have to order the seared sea scallops or the boneless beef short rib. If you want something a little less formal, the smoked wings are delicious. They are seasoned with a dry rub and smoked. They are then prepared in the open flame brick oven for a nice crispy skin- so good! For sides, don't miss out on the succotash (fresh corn sliced from the cob and sauteed with butter and salt/pepper mixed with butter beans that have been reducing in a chicken stock). If you want to indulge in some comfort food, go for the Mac n cheese or the augratin potatoes. A perfect ending to any meal is the coconut cake. I'm not even a fan of coconut and yet I LOVE this cake. You will not be disappointed!",

And the waiter/bartender who helped us just confused us more and we ended up getting waaaaay more food than we could eat, you live and you learn.  Not only that but you need to make a reservation for dinner no matter what time day or time you go. We didn't make a reservation on a Tuesday night and we were seriously frowned upon. Felt all judged for having the gall to enter with no ressies.",

    "text": "I took my parents here last night for father's day. We stopped in at around 5:30, after I baked in the sun staying in line for Summer Pops at Symphony Park so that I could put our blanket down. It worked out perfectly (in my opinion), so for those who are planning to go to Summer Pops this month, consider putting down blanket and head to dinner. It's inhumane to make any one person to sit out there in the sun for 3 hours. I cannot imagine it to be any fun or at all enjoyable even with bottles of wine.   Back to Rooster's... it was quite empty when we arrived. I opted to sit at the bar area (because they have bar bites after 4pm daily). The only disadvantage is that bar area seatings are all backless high stools, not the most comfortable but it's not bad. The bartender was also our server, which they may need to reconsider that. The bar is long, and the opening is toward the back away from all the tables. That means the poor lady has to walk AROUND the bar every time she's trying to reach any of her tables. Needless to say, the service eventually got to be a little slow, with other people stepping in to help out. I didn't mind, we weren't in a hurry, but I could see it being a problem for others.  Food was solid. I have always enjoyed the food at Rooster's. We ended up ordering an array of dishes to share. We had 2 things off the bar bites chalkboard: chicken pot pie ($8) & the pork rillettes served on toasts ($6). The pot pie which was super cute in presentation and tasted great. It looked like a treasure box which was made of a nice flaky crust. The pork rillettes was ok... the apple butter was a little overpowering. From the dinner menu I ordered sea scallops ($18), gnocchi ($12) and mussels ($9). 4 sea scallops came in an order, and while it was seared cripsy on top, it was a little over seasoned. I enjoyed it still, especially the pea puree they were served on. Gnocchi was light and fluffy, and cooked in a duck sugo sauce. So if you are not into liver, you probably need to skip this. Mussels were good, about 18 in an order, and came with a big piece of toast to soak up the sauce. We ended the meal with the bourbon cream pudding ($8). We were a little disappointed they're out of the coconut cake... but the pudding was a good alternative.   Overall it was a great meal. My parents enjoyed it, the open kitchen kept them entertained. It's a nice quiant setting, which I prefer over all the crazy large restaurants in the area. Now if management can figure out the bar area service assignment, I can then relax for the bartender.",

We ordered the chicken fingers for the kids and there were 4 pieces of the size of chicken nuggets at Chick-fil-a. They have brought more in and did not charge us, but this was very strange. I ordered the roasted chicken pizza and it was an appetizer size, I would have eaten something else if I knew it. The pizza tasted okay, could taste the garlic only nothing else. Restaurants keep adding garlic to tomato sauces and this is wrong, should be stopped. Tomato sauce does not have garlic, not sure who taught that to the american chefs. The fries that came with my wife's burger were great and she said the burger was average but nothing memorable. Will probably go back, but without high expectations.",

There are all kinds of roosters on the wall. I really enjoyed my wine and my friend loved the beer. Portions are great if your trying to loose weight or not hungry.  The food was okay. They have several eclectic dishes. The corn was bland and cold despite it being in a skillet. The strips that came in a sauce was okay, but lacked flavor. I had the shrimp salad and I wish the shrimp was warm and seasoned, but it was plain, cold, and lacked flavor or seasoning.  They just tossed it on there. Management came by to check on the table and seemed to help staff that was nice. Over I am not sure what the hype is about this place on a weekday mid afternoon this place was packed. I am wondering if I ordered the wrong dishes or if they had new persons in the back making the food. The best part about this place is the service, however the menu and food served needs to be re-examined.",

If you only want one side, definitely order the corn.",

The Pork Shoulder Sandwich at 10 bucks is the best deal in Southpark. Very diverse menu.  I like some of the bread, but they need a nice butter to go with it, oil is ok but butter rules.",

Their service staff rocked it out; drinks on time, attentive, and super polite and friendly,  what more can you ask for,  Food, Man, everything that came out was on point.  Tasty, warm and all was well seasoned, no complaints.  Not gonna lie, duck confit... gotta give it a try, pretty legit.    And the bread pudding too for dessert...omg, its a southern staple, and they completely nailed.  Not gonna lie, i licked my plate,  Overall, Job well done guys,   This place had been a staple in the Charlotte area for quite some time, and i totally understand why now.

I have eaten here on many occasions, and honestly, have never been disappointed. I find the portions to be sensible, and keep in mind that many of the items are a la carte.  If you order carefully, you will have plenty of food without breaking the bank.  This must be some sort of adaptive trait.  If you get nothing else, please take my advice and order the:  Pan fried corn.  Buttery and slightly browned.  It's to die for.  Duck confit: Phenomenal here.  Assorted Mushrooms: So good, that our dining neighbors *almost* took a bite before ordering their own!  Mac & Cheese: This is listed under pastas, not sides, or vegetables, duh.  It is OUT of this world.  The quarter or half natural chicken is also a great choice.  They also always have excellent specials. Last time it was the duck wing special that stole my heart.  I still catch myself thinking about those wings....   The servers I've had are always helpful.   And for dessert? Get the coconut cake.  The atmosphere is country, cozy, and classy!",

When we complained to manager he seemed pissed and argued with us on the scallop count and our issue with brown avocado.. We get this salad all of the time and know what to expect.. We were more put off by manager than food.. We went back today and had another mediocre meal. I got the arugula chicken salad. It looked like then took a plate threw a handful of arugula on it then dropped a solid chicken breast on top.. No blue cheese and salad dressing came in ramekin. Wife had veggie plate and some items seemed to be very over cooked. Bread which is usually very good was totally stale and cold the last two times..

She almost seemed out of breath. She also spoke very fast & we needed to have her repeat herself.  Very noisy atmosphere, yet we really enjoyed the fun decor.     The menu was exceptional, Many interesting choices!  The specials sounded delicious. Great wine selection.  Our salads and entrees were wonderful, perfectly seasoned and prepared.

That said, the food is standard grilled meat & fish & are tasty & presented well and everything is a la carte.  The meat portions were fair but I've noticed portions becoming smaller everywhere & here is no exception.  One vegetable side is b-a-r-e-l-y enough for two people, maybe three if you're sharing 3-4 sides.  I really liked the bacon grits even though I'm not usually a fan, but this is the only other starch if you don't care for potatoes.  Another lady I was with had never liked grits, but did enjoy a small portion.  The staff is excellent & I love how they bring the bottle of wine to the table to present to you and pour your glass even when you've only ordered the glass.  The after dinner drinks/coffees were intriguing and we tried several and they were mostly great - The Rusty Nail(?) was more like a weak tea.  The open kitchen adds to the extreme noisiness of this space, so be prepared for it to sound like bedlam in there.",

Now, I am not saying that every restaurant needs to serve Applebee's-size trenchers of filler, but here you have to spend a lot of money to leave sans hunger.  In addition to this, the food is relatively so-and-so.  The last time I went for lunch, I ordered a roast turkey sandwich.  It was ok, except for the fact that the bacon was burned.  You'll find a lot of little careless errors like that.  Additionally, the dining room is so cavernous that you cannot hear your dining companions, and, perhaps even more frustratingly, the servers cannot hear you.  They really need to put up some acoustic paneling or something.    Rooster's... meh.  There's potential, but it's just that--still potential.",

You may smell like you've been sitting around a fire when you leave, but it's a small trade off for great food.  The decor is a bit alarming - And I don't mean to scare you, but there are roosters on the wall.  Try not to upset them....  I've eaten quite a few things off the menu and in generally, it's all really good.  The best tip I can provide is try the specials.  They are generally seasonal and local foods.   I have never been disappointed when order the specials.  Also - the vegetable they offer are just great too.  I'm typically a meat eater, but I enjoy getting a bunch of vegetables to try different things.  My two nits about my numerous experience there:  1) I've only ordered red wine there, and every time I find the wine is served around room temperature.  I know this sounds super pretentious, but I prefer my red wine chilled a bit.  Room temperature is just a bit too warm.   2) For as wide of menu as Rooster's offers, the drink menu is extremely light.  I would encourage them to develop some cool seasonal cocktails.  This was one missing piece to the experience....  Absolutely head to Rooster's for a great meal - One of the best in Charlotte.",

Everything is always prepared perfectly. This is a well run restaurant; caution you need a reservation unless you want to sit at a high top table in the bar area. This night we had several salads, Calamari (not as good as Wolfgang's). The flounder special was delicious, one of the best fish dishes we've had. Other entrees included the parpadelle with beef ragout, natural juice chicken, hanger steak and mac and cheese. Everyone loved their selections. Dessert was the currant bread pudding with vanilla gelato and a coconut cake. Everything was spot on. A $34 zin worked well with our choices.",

Yes, the portions are small, and so when you add up enough things to get full, suddenly you parceled together a $24 meal.  But I just have a problem with the execution. I've been twice for dinner and twice for lunch. Their grilled salmon was burnt and not tasty. When I got a salmon salad on top of frisee, red peppers and fingerlings, the salmon was almost pure fat and tasted awful and I walked away hungry. 1/5  The pizzas are tiny.  Oh, the fries are actually quite delicious.  I'm just not clear why my friends like it so much.  Next time, I would just go to sit outside, have a glass of vino and maybe munch a little on the corn.   Chef Noble, all my love for King's Kitchen, but this one misses the mark consistently for me.

However, when we went to order some of these dinner menu items, items such as the pizzas were not ready, along with a couple of the potato-based side items. Details of this were not disclosed when ordering, which was quite irritating. Which brings me to the service, which was extremely average for a 3.30pm on a Sunday afternoon. Drinks and food took along time to arrive, the menu was poorly explained, and just generally not very impressive. In addition, we had fruit flies at our table throughout the meal. When I mentioned this to our server, she said they knew about the issue but it was because of people opening the front door- interesting explanation I thought. My concern was apparently shared with the manager but no visit was paid to our table thereafter. Beyond that, the food was very good and had a nice ambience. I would suggest they decide what kind of the restaurant they are in terms of al a carte vs non al a carte since some dishes included sides and some didn't. For those that didn't, this was poorly explained and the side dishes were expensive and not particularly family style, as suggested by our server. Also, it was kind of odd receiving a breast of duck in a cold dish, without a plate to add sides to. While I'd recommend the food, there are far better restaurants for the price point, with better service.",

I should have expected it but was slightly surprised by the Carolina style, vinegar based BBQ sauce.

    "text": "My husband and I have eaten here twice for dinner and both times we were very pleased with our meals as well as the service.  Roosters can either be a $40 dinner or a $100 all-out eating fest.  We have tried both approaches.    The first night we ate there for Valentine's Day - we shared a 1/2 carafe of wine, we each had a salad, and I ordered the hangar steak (delicious!) and my husband ate seafood off the specials menu.  Both of us were incredibly happy with our meals.  We shared some beets as a side dish - very tasty!  That evening a special dessert was also offered - an apple tart that required about a 20 minute preparation so I ordered that when my dinner arrived.  The tart was incredible.  My husband ordered the coconut cake and, unfortunately, it was still partially frozen when it arrived at the table.    Tonight we ate at the bar.  Very cordial server, bartender, hostess, busgirl ... everyone was very friendly.  We did not have a reservation so we opted to sit at one of the community tables near the bar.  My husband and I shared a plate of zucchini fries with a lemon aioli.  The zucchini fries were pretty good but the lemon aioli was amazing!  My husband ordered the hangar steak tonight and I ordered the smoked wings.  We shared a plate of brussels sprouts as our side.  I am an enormous wing fan and these were fabulous.  They were hot in a peppery hot sort of way.  The plate of wings was huge but I somehow managed to finish them with only a little help from my husband.  I cannot wait to order these again!  No dessert for us tonight and no drinks so our bill was just over $40.  Delicious.",

We ordered enough sides for the entire table to share and my favorite were the potatoes, that could have been my entire meal and I would have been happy.   I liked that they had local craft beer on the menu although the two best were missing: NoDa and Old Meck.  The atmosphere is great. It's very open, somewhat loud but not enough that you can't enjoy your conversation.   Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "So this was another one of those places.  The kind of place which was talked up like crazy.  We went here one Friday for lunch this past summer, and I can honestly say I was disappointed.  I was told how good their burgers are and how 'kewl' the place was, etc... blah blah the usual...  We arrived around 11:20am --I know that's early, but I start to eat my desk if I get past 11:45am.  We were seated instantly and our drink order was taken relatively quickly.  About 15 minutes later, at about 11:40am, our drinks were brought to the table.  As you can imagine, I'm starting to think about chomping on the table at this point!  Soon as our waitress passed out the drinks --that she clearly ran out to bottle herself at the local Coca Cola bottling facility, she took our order.  Then we waited...  And waited.  And waited.  Finally, the order was brought to the table at around 12:35pm.  I received a side salad, which was simply just a side salad and nothing more --I 'think' it may have had a tomato on it --bonus, and this smallish burger sitting in the middle of a plate the size of a small platter --interesting, I thought.  I figured based on this plain, weak presentation, this thing was going to taste like fillet on a bun!  I couldn't have been more wrong.  It tasted nothing more than 90/10 ground beef cooked on my grill at home one night after work, without seasoning--very disappointing.  To add to the fun, they actually screwed up my coworkers lunch, resulting in him having to wait another 10-15 minutes for the reorder.  Aside from the fun activities of the time it took to get the order, the restaurant itself was literally 55; it was freezing in there.  Perhaps that was because I had no food inside me to keep me warm?  For the food you got and its taste, I felt was overpriced --maybe they just have to charge a lot to keep the AC units running with such ferocity...",

    "text": "After trying to come to lunch a bit late the other day, we were finally able to hit this place during lunch hours. Lunch ends around 3-330p, so make sure not to go to lunch too late like we did.  The atmosphere when you walk in is very comfortable. The smells are divine coming out of the open roasters. While casual, it has a rustic classy feel. All of the interior is very well themed and compliments the rustic-style rotisserie foods.  Service was on point. Our server checked in appropriately and refilled waters without being asked. Though not up to our server, our food came out quickly even though the restaurant was relatively busy. My partner and I shared the arugula, chevre, and peach salad. The salad was very fresh and had a good summer feel. The peaches were not very acidic which paired well with the vinaigrette. When the salad was delivered, the runner asked if we would like fresh cracked pepper. We should have done so, as it was definitely a flavor I felt would have helped break down some of the vinaigrette. The vinaigrette wouldn't have been an issue if there had been a touch more chevre as it was the counter balance, but the chevre was extremely sparse. An ounce more would have been perfect. My partner and I shared two different sandwiches, one being the chicken, gruyere, roasted garlic balsamic and the other being the spit roasted turkey breast with bacon. I'll start with the chicken. The chicken was moist and the balsamic was perfect. However, when it came down to the gruyere it was hard to find. When we opened the sandwich, there was very little. We weren't sure if this was intentional or not, but in both areas that there were cheese it was lacking.  The spit roasted turkey was fresh, crisp, and refreshing. I opted out of the mayo (I'm not exactly sure who would put mayo and avocado on the same sandwich, but that just seems like overkill to me) which was a good choice. I felt that the turkey lacked seasoning as the chicken on the other sandwich had been so flavorful. This is a personal preference as my partner did not agree, but I would have rathered wheat instead of white bread.  Both of us got fries on the side, and while a bit overly salted, the hand cut fries were crisp and fresh.   All in all, we'll definitely be back. I wanted to try their lunch before diving into dinner and I fully anticipate returning soon.",

I actually think a la carte pricing can work if the entree portions are big enough to make them a meal in and of themselves, which Roosters does.  There wine selection is good and the wait staff is very helpful in pairing one of their many wines with dishes you plan to order.  I had the chopped salad and was told the butter beans were to die for....well, I don't think dead came to mind when i ate them, but they were pretty good.  I ordered the hanger steak which was cooked perfectly to medium rare and tender!  Lordy...lordy!  It is a large space, but the bar had community seating which I love because for two reasons....first, it allows you to \"spice it up\" as you'll never know who might sit beside you...and second, many places in NYC have this type of seating.  If you ever find yourself in the South....check this place out!",

The manager told me that they didn't even have merlot. After looking at the drink menu, they did have merlot by the glass. Officially don't like him. Ken came over and served me. I ordered a small Ceaser salad and some smoked wings. Salad was different but gourmet. The wings were great!  Come in after 4pm for $6 wings. The menu is fairly small but the food taste is Worth the lack of selection. I might not come back for a dinner date but if I want to waste some time at the bar, I'll ask for Ken.",

At first we were greeted with a semi-snooty \"do you have a reservation?\" which is fine to ask but you don't need to look down on me because we made a last minute decision to dine at your establishment. And, for the sake of being honest, the lack of the last star is because of this initial greeting. A second hostess appeared and the attitude disappeared and we were shown to a nice booth.   We sat for a few minutes and had the chance to decide what we would like to drink from their pretty impressive wine by the glass list. The wine I originally ordered was out but the substitution was delicious so no big deal there!   We placed an order of wings to have as an appetizer and they were delicious. These are not soaked in buffalo sauce dip them in ranch dressing wings, they are dry rubbed and smoked and the flavor is amazing.   For mains I went with the burger and fries and the husband had the salmon and a side of the corn. First, let me say that he was kind enough to share a couple of bites with me so I could taste his and even though I'm not a big fish person I thought the salmon was really good as was the corn. The burger was delicious! Seriously, one of the best I have had in a really long time and the fries were also so good!   The service was spot on and we're really looking forward to going back and trying more menu options. The patio seating looked really nice but I have recently quit smoking and there were people smoking at those tables so I'm not sure we'll be able to enjoy that anytime soon.",

They just aren't geared to handle large parties for sure so I'm not sure how bad it was in smaller tables either!   After 3 - 5 different direct follow ups w staff we got our first drinks in the table in about an hour!  Well most of them.

We toured and were definately \"wow-ed\" by their new space and the options for private events.  We met with their catering and private party manager and had a great experience planning a menu and the aesthetics of the event.  Unfortunately, the day before our rehearsal dinner the manager sent us a note that they would not be able to make it to supervise our dinner and would send a resturant manager in their place.  Upon arrival, the back-up manager was no where in site.      Overall, the space is beautiful and the food is delicious; however, there were many details we discussed with the initial manager that failed in execution.  The dinner lasted 4 hours and was exteremly drawn out due to the lack of management there to oversee servers and the progression of the cocktail hour to dinner.  This was a disappointing experience for my fiance and myself as we spent a lot of time planning and finding what we thought to be the perfect venue for the night before our wedding.  Would recommend the resturant; however, they have a ways to go in the private event world.",

From the young lady that just started our waters, to the GM asking how our experience was, SPOT ON!   When we first sat down, the young lady that filled our waters offered recommendations that prepared us for a solid lunch, probably one of the best we've had in a long while.   Then came our server, who was just as equally enthusiastic and helpful. They both recommended the wings, onion rings, brisket burger, pulled rotisserie chicken bowl, and Mac n Cheese. So we said YES! To all of it!  Our wings were perfectly seasoned, no dipping sauce needed, onion just as flavorful. GM ran out food and asked if we needed anything else, he kinda cringed when asked for ranch with the wings and ketchup for the onion rings....NOW WE SEE WHY, no sauce needed, it would just make them taste like everyone else's. Maybe the best wings around, BOLD STATEMENT, I know.  Then came out main courses, brisket burger cooked to perfection, medium rare to medium, like it came off the grill in the back yard. My wife's pulled rotisserie chicken bowl, OMG. Collard greens, pulled chicken, I think chorizo pieces, add in the sweet potato puree and there you have comfort food with a twist. PHENOMENAL!

We ordered the duck special, the wood-fired chicken, salmon, beets, fried corn, and Mac n cheese. All sub-par. Even the roasted beets had salt beads that overpowered the dish. The only thing we actually enjoyed was the calamari. And no, they do not have the best Mac n cheese. Whatever combination of cheeses they use, there were very strong hints of American cheese. Maybe just a bad combo that made it taste so. I'll go back for the calamari only.",

My husband had the meatloaf with sweet potato puree and spinach. I had a chicken and cheese pizzetta, which is a fancy word for pizza. We enjoyed our food. My pizza was ordinary but good. Nothing extraordinary. My husband's meatloaf was very good, but the portion size is small for the money. Overall we enjoyed the experience there mostly for the nice environment and attentive waitstaff. We would return.",

From the fried corn, to the hangar steak, to the coconut cake to cap off the meal, I couldn't find myself upset at any point other than when I realized my stomach was full. Our server, Chancellor, was nothing less than the human personification of yeti cooler full of dads favorite beer on the Fourth of July - Chill. Given the chance, I would eat this meal a thousand times over, and then gladly recommend to even my worst enemy's",

I had to get something at the mall and we didn't feel like eating at the food court. So my husband mentioned it and we decided to check this one out. Since the one he always goes is in another location.  We got there around 4pm, they were not busy and we were sat right away.  We decided to sit outside because the weather was nice and the afternoon was pretty charming. We decided to split half of chicken with a side of mac and cheese.  The food got ready pretty fast. I am not a big fan os Mac and cheese, maybe it is because wherever you go the Mac and cheese will always be different, however always blend. But this time for my surprise and happiness the Mac and cheese was wonderful! So cheesy and creamy.... Tasted like  real Parmesan cheese! The chicken came in a sauce that looked like butter and was really great! I keep dreaming about that mac n cheese, it is 10$ for a small side but it makes every penny worth it! Our waiter was really friendly and attentive. With that being said we will definitely be back for more :)",

    "text": "Just had dinner here for the first time last week when I had family in town and must say this is a great option for groups as they have great quality food and lots of space.  Really enjoyed the elegant and welcoming atmosphere on the inside which boasted high vaulted ceilings, classic upscale decor, and huge comfortable booths if you're looking to a great setting to have dinner with a group of friends or family.  The interior really compliments and sets the table for the limited yet adequate dinner menu and family style sides.  Personally, I really liked the menu as it did not give me anxiety trying to decide on what to get.  They specialize in rotisserie chicken and a few other unique dishes, but everything we ordered was great.  By all accounts, the chicken was incredible and I ordered the duck for my entre and it was very, very good (although not the best I've ever had, I would still recommend to anyone who enjoys duck).  The sides are a la carte and done family style, so we shared the mashed potatoes and mac n cheese between 4 people.  The sides were superb and made to order.  They also had a great wine and drink menu which we shared a bottle or Cote du rhone ($36 not bad).  All and all it will not be the cheapest ($$ on Yelp should prob be $$+), you definitely get what you pay for here.  Will return!  Food:  9/10 Service:  10/10 Price:  7/10 ambiance:  9/10 value: 7.5/10",

On the occasion that we remember them, we're never disappointed. We've sat in their dinning room for a special occasion (happy birthday to meeeeeeee, I'll have the scallops!) but more often than not land at the bar. It's more laid back and there's almost never a wait.   Any meat or seafood dish is going to be a win at Rooster's. We love the BBQ chicken and scallops. On our most recent visit, I had a daily special -- lamb bolognese gnocchi. It wasn't as good as Bruce Moffet's gnocchi but it wasn't bad either.   We even love grabbing a couple beers and a charcuterie board. Depending on which 5 meats and cheeses you select, price ranges from @ $22-$28. A steal when most of the meats and cheeses on their own will run you $8-$10.",

We arrived slightly after our reservation time.  We alerted the hostess that we were here for a birthday party - I guess they had three.  We saw the rest of the group in \"the cellar\" which is through the restaurant and through a shopping mall hallway. There's a large bar that runs the length of the room.  We were sat into two - eight person tables.  No major issues.   We ordered a bottle of wine to share - the waiter opened the bottle (with a little too much force) and some wine went shooting out.  Luckily, it didn't get onto anyone's clothes (it was a Rioja - tempranillo (red)).  However, there was some (not a lot) on the table/plates/etc.  The wine wasn't expensive - or else I would have been a little more upset.  We had snacked earlier at Corkbuzz (see other review) so I got the mussels, and my friends go the spaghetti, the shrimp, and the duck.  When I ordered the spaghetti for my friend, the waiter responded, \"Really?!  um, ok.\" - with an eye roll.    After a question about how the shrimp was prepared, my other friend ordered the shrimp.  We all received our orders.  $18 for seven shrimp.  No sides...just seven grilled shrimp.  \"Maybe the shrimp were huge shrimp\"....nope, just normal grilled shrimp.  My mussels were good - one unopened, but they were better when I had them at the uptown location a couple weeks prior.  Spagetti was good!  The duck was amazing.  So, meh service, some things of horrible value.",

I was there two nights ago & felt the food was overseasoned which is hiding the True flavor.    Service is always very friendly & accommodating.  Next time I'll remember to ask for dressing on the side & steamed veggies unadorned.  Yes, there are folks that can't survive without salt... give them a salt shaker.   With the awesome Charlotte Farmers market nearby... let the veggies speak for themselves.  I find lots of fried and \"smothered\" options on plenty of southern menus.  Roosters needs to be a gourmet cut above to match the price & service.  They've hit the mark before & they can do it again  You can definitely do worse in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "If I have someone coming to Charlotte for the first time, I take them here.  It's a boisterous place with a central open kitchen and some damn fine food. Actually, the fries here are the best friends I've had anywhere. In the world.  THAT good. Making reservations ahead of time usually circumvents any wait time. If you want the Mother/Father's Day brunch - and you do - book it early. It's a wonderful brunch with so many good things on it.  The menu at Roosters tends to be small. The lunch menu of sandwiches/burgers, salads, a couple soups (French onion is a standout), small pizzas and the like will please pretty much anybody. Dinner has a standard menu that has chicken, pastas and the like with 2 features every night. The fish selections are always wonderful. The other special can be a pasta, pork, beef - it's entirely seasonal and random.  They will ALWAYS sell out.  Roosters is not the place to go to at 10pm Saturday night and expect to find the trout with fiddleheads still available. The secondary menu feels like a letdown once the glamorous specials are out.  So, what's the favorite thing here besides the fries? Pan roasted corn. Yes, really. It's a local thing and a roosters is known for their corn: peppery, buttery and good.  The best thing here is something nobody else will want or notice, a totally overlooked menu item: on the children's menu is my son's most favorite dish ever: duck confit. You can't go wrong with anything you order here. Jim Noble is the man.",

    "text": "My husband and I visited Rooster's in South Park for the first time on Saturday night.  My first impressions of the restaurant were excellent. We had made a reservation via OpenTable, and upon arriving for our 7:30 reservation at 7:25PM, the hostess took one glance at her terminal after asking my name and said, \"Your table is waiting, follow me.\" That's what I want to hear.  Once we were sat, however, it was a full 10 minutes before our server came to our table. After such a prompt seating by a hostess who conveyed gravitas and professionalism (she wasn't some college kid, which impressed me greatly) I was expecting promptness and seasoned professionalism throughout the place.   Our waiter finally showed up, and didn't ask if we wanted to know the specials, or have any information for us. Instead, when I asked him about the beers on draft, he informed me that no beers were on draft (which is fine) and disappeared for another five minutes to get us a beer menu.   He placed it with us, then left again, then returned to ask us if we had decided on drinks. We had, so we ordered them, and again he was off - with no inquiry about if we had any questions on the menu, and no offer to take our order. Yeah, I was hungry. Got a problem with that?  We finally got bread, and water, which I had trouble getting refilled. I also drink a lot, and drink fast (which yes, caused me problems in my college days). I found that water-filling staff members would  come and fill the water glasses of the newly-seated tables around us, without a single look at my empty water glass. Finally, I stopped one woman going to the table next to me and asked with my eyes and a nudge if she could spare some more water.   Our orders were eventually placed and the food was good - very good. But the portions were small. The three stars are for the food, to be sure. My husband ordered the lamb chop special, which he very much enjoyed. He particularly enjoyed the mint sauce that came with it.  I ordered the hangar steak, cooked medium, and the pan fried corn. I received hangar steak, cooked rare. Fortunately, I can enjoy steak cooked along the spectrum from rare to medium well, so I didn't send it back. Besides, I had waited long enough for my food, I wasn't about to let my server take it back so he could have them re-cook it and risk the spit. So yeah, when he checked in I smiled broadly and said, \"Everything is great!\" as I ate my steak that mooed. The corn was good, but nothing I couldn't easily recreate in a cast iron skillet at home with a few ears of fresh corn and some butter.  This restaurant visit was a part of our \"date night\" so my husband and I enjoyed  the evening. The next day, my husband confessed to me that he was expecting more from a \"wood-fired kitchen\" - like, stuff that actually tasted like it had been cooked over a wood fire. Neither of our entrees had any smokiness to them. He had been itching to go to Firebirds, but we chose Rooster's instead because it was \"new\". Firebirds delivered more on the smoke when we last visited there.  We likely won't be going back to Rooster's for date-night in the future. The food was okay, but didn't wow me. The ambiance was \"meh\". The gem of the night was that fantastic professional hostess. I wish Noble could channel that excellence into the rest of the experience at Roosters.",

I ordered their special pasta. It was salty. I was quite full and didn't feel well after it, so I ordered croissants to go. I didn't check what the waitress brought and went home. I opened the box and saw half cut, grilled not fresh croissant. Who cuts croissants in half and why it wasn't fresh? $3 for one, by the way. Preposterous. I felt cheated. It would be better not to waste this nice bag and boxes but bring me normal fresh croissant.  The waitress also wasn't good. She barely was paying attention, was always rushing somewhere. I didn't want to leave a tip, but my husband said that we couldn't do this, it's a tradition. I believe, tipping creates a grey area, when you don't know what to do if you didn't like the experience. I wish all restaurants had hospitality included.  I don't know should I come back because the first experience was good or forget about this place.",

The service is quick and the servers know about menu offerings to suit your palate. The prices are reasonable. The wine selection is huge.   The concerns: The wings were salty and burnt. The short ribs was one inch of goodness but still one inch. The mac n cheese was too sharp...too sour. It arrived to the table in small cast iron skillets so it was too hot for us to eat with our meal. We picked at it until it was time to leave. By the time I got back to the hotel, it was the perfect temp to snack on...and I did at 10:30 p.m. By 4:30 a.m., I was begging for mercy! The extra tangy/tart cheese sauce had my stomach in knots. I ended up throwing up because it would not settle in my stomach. Horrible experience.",

I wasn't sure if he was kidding or not and we placed an order. We ordered wings and calamari, the short rib with fries, onion rings and mac'n'cheese. These plates plus 2 cocktails came to $130 with tip. I will say the short rib, fries and onion rings were great. The wings seemed like they weren't fully cooked. Also, they're an order of 10 (if I'm being generous) for $18. I should have asked to have these taken off our check as they were gummy. I don't think I'll be back again after this visit due to the service or food. One good dish is not worth $130 and let's face it fries and onion rings are almost always good.",

The food is always mediocre but the service is way above average.   Meal: The meal itself is like I have mentioned above, is mediocre but I have yet to have something that is terrible. We started with a meat and cheese board. The selections change often so it keeps it interesting and ours happened to be really good. This particular evening I had the beef short rib as my main. It was tender, it has a good flavor. I paired this with the mashed potatoes, corn and roasted beets (all sharable sides).  I am usually not a dessert person but bread pudding is definitely a selection I will think of to share. The bread pudding did not disappoint.    The location: Its in Southpark and traffic is always congested and parking is always interesting. We arrived very early on a Wednesday so it wasn't a problem. I will say that by the time 6pm rolled around, they got busy. The restaurant itself is in a very strange location and it shares the breeze way with neighboring business. This would include a bathroom, a single bathroom. The decor stays True to the rooster theme, with a modern rustic feel. I am not overly or under impressed.   Service: The moment you walk in, or walk anywhere, you are greeted or asked if you need anything. Our server was extremely friendly and very attentive.   I am not in a rush to go back but I would return for the bread pudding and the Honey Basil Martini!",

    "text": "If you haven't been to Rooster's in a while, do yourself a favor and get over there.  We decided to go after a chef friend recommended it so highly.  She told us that the Executive Chef, Zack Renner, was amazing and that they served her farm's pork.  That's all she had to say, we were there.  We reserved a table for 8 so they put us in a room that looked like it might once have been the hallway of a small strip mall.  BUT they'd doctored it up with pretty twinkle lights and a nice fountain in the middle.  And then there was this adorable pig door holder we were all entranced with...and we weren't alone.  A few people stopped to take pictures of Porky.  Our waitress was so kind and deftly handled our large(ish) group by giving us suggestions, fixing drinks when we weren't satisfied and delivering the bad news about dessert.  The management also stopped by a time or two to make sure our night was going well..which it very much was.  Cocktails are the best way to begin Girl Nosh.  Rooster's has a fine selection of wine, brews and mixed drinks.  This one (I forget the name) was muddled cucumbers, raspberry and gin.  I have to admit it wasn't for me, but others at the table found it refreshing and light.  To soak up all of this alcohol, they brought us an assortment of delicious baked breads with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The bread was hearty and delicious.  Very nutty.  The French Onion soup was not one of my favorite soups.  It was hearty, but not as flavorful as it should have been for such murky and dark broth.  I didn't opt for it on my second visit.  The salads were all so fresh and dressed perfectly.   Whole romaine leaves topped with walnuts, tangerine slices and grated Pecorino Romano cheese.  Perfect.  My salad was a wedge.  I don't know why I'm not more adventurous.  I just love a wedge.  And this one was perfect.  The cold, crispy iceberg lettuce topped with creamy, tangy blue cheese dressing is a comfort food.  This one had some pickled red onions on top that were both sweet and tart, and really gave the salad a punch!  When you go to Rooster's, you must have something that was wood-fired or wood-grilled.  Shannon got the salmon, and it was perfectly cooked...charred on the outside and tender on the inside.  She was so happy with her choice!  You know, sometimes side dishes are predictable or dialed in.  An afterthought.  At Rooster's the sides are at center stage alongside the entrees.  All sides here are designed for two people, but are so good you may not want (or be able) to share.  The fried corn should be your first choice.  It's real corn.  Not from a can.  And it is pan-fried with spices that make is lip-smacking good.  The stone ground grits are another perfect choice.  Little nuggets of corny goodness are buried in them and there is plenty of heavy cream to make them rich and velvety.  One of the best things I've ever put in my mouth was the wood-fired sunchoke.  It sure didn't look like much more than a ginger root when it came to the table, but the taste was amazing.  When I saw the word \"sunchoke\" I immediately conjured images or the artichoke.  The sunchoke, however, is a tuber, like a potato.  It was creamy and had a little bit of sweetness to it.  The wood firing brought out a nuttiness in it as well.  Very complex for such a simple dish.  One of my favorites for the night!  By the time we were done eating, most of the tables around us were empty.  And they'd take our top dessert choice with them: the coconut cake.  We didn't let that stop us, though.  We all ordered the back up dessert which was an apple tarte.  The waitress called it something else, but for the life of me, I cannot remember what that was.  To describe it I'd say it was dried apples (re-hydrated, of course) placed atop a buttery and light croissant crust.  It was accompanied by a scoop of vanilla bean gelato and a spill of rich caramel sauce.  Even though apples aren't my favorite dessert fruit, this reminded me of the fried pies my grandmother used to make.  The apples had a tart but sweet taste and were very soft.  The crust wasn't overly sweet, so it was perfect with the gelato and the caramel.  Decadent and delicious!  (Original review on my blog Barenakedchefsaidso)",

Upon entering, this place didn't look that big but the host took us to a back section of the restaurant and you can see how deep the restaurant goes.   The food is very rustic and flavorful. I ordered duck confit with lentils. It was very good. My husband ordered a French Onion Soup and it was packed with onions.   Although I would recommend this restaurant, I think it should be labeled $$$ rather than $$ in Yelp.  Using Chili's as an example that's a $$.",

Tried the Brussels sprout appetizer that was on special - excellent! My husband loved his flounder and I really liked the chicken pizza.   The service:  Very...odd.  We started out with a server who was super rushed, and he said it was because they were having a staff meeting.  When I went to use the restroom, I walked by the staff meeting and it was really weird.  Tons of people, and the person holding it was speaking really loud so customers could hear the things they were apparently \"pushing\" for the evening.  After this staff meeting...we got a different server.  No one introduced themselves so I couldn't tell you who anyone was.  Overall just not a friendly atmosphere at all.    At the end of the meal, I noticed several items on the menu were priced incorrectly (higher on the check than they were on the menu).  I had to say something (which is awkward), and while it was fixed, the server again wasn't very friendly about it.  Might try again...the food was very good!",

Food- You can't go wrong with the Chicken or short rib. For the sides I'd recommend ordering about 1 per person and sharing it with the table so you can try a few different items.   Parking- parking can be a pain in the butt especially on the weekend. I've parked in the back of the Walgreens lot several times and it hasn't been an issue yet.   Reservations- if it's the weekend just like any other popular restaurant please make a reservation. It's always annoying to hear other customers complain that they had to wait so long to get in with no reservation.",

The setup is really different between the two, this one is pretty much has a more open feel and the other seems more intimate. Maybe because of the location. What first stroke me as odd at this establishment and the actual size of it, is that there is only one bathroom per Gender!!! That's weird. Also, it's a Friday night and they close at 10pm, pretty early in my opinion. It's a girls night and we had reservations for 9:30 and didn't leave until around 12am. So absolutely cool that they don't rush you out even though you see them cleaning up around you. Lol. Get down to the food...short but sweet, EVERYTHING was delicious. They are an a la carte restaurant so sides and proteins are purchased separately. The sides are moderately priced and depending on a persons appetite, can be shared with another person. SB:their drinks are more expensive than the sides. Our table of 6 ordered a variety of the corn, mashed potatoes, grits and mac and cheese. All delicious especially that damn corn. The bread that was brought out when we arrived was hard as bricks and the oil given with it was bland and didn't serve a purpose(my only minus for food) Our Server Tim was great and handled is with ease. And I always give kudos to a Server who can handle 6 Full Grown Women with a smile and knowledge gets a 10 across the board from me.",

Love the open concept kitchen as well, I actually sat at the food bar so that I could watch the chefs work their magic and I enjoyed it. One thing that's a little different about their menu is that you have to order everything separately, which can cause the meals to be pricier but I think the food is worth it. I had the pork chops, which were super juicy and delicious. The chef cooks them medium so if that's too undercooked for you then make sure to tell the waiter! For my sides I got mac & cheese, fried corn, and sauteed spinach. I had zero complaints about the food or the service and I can't wait to come back and try new things on the menu!",

    "text": "Independent and non-franchised chef-owned restaurants are like snowflakes, each one a little different.  Some you adore, some just aren't so appealing.  Certainly Rooster's and it's high-profile chef (for Charlotte) fit into that category.  Having now visited here a healthy handful of times, I can say if you are the type of person who looks at dining out as more of an experience than an occasion to stuff your gullet, Rooster's will appeal.  First, the ambiance:  Spacious room with an open kitchen right in the center, where the wood-fired grill is always visible.  Like a buzzing beehive, the chefs busily push each other on while servers quickly pick up plates and make deliveries to the surrounding booths and high-topped tables.  The decoration is best described as rustic European-country farm.  A wall of wine compartmentalized into bins contrasts with stuffed fowl on the opposing wall.  Dark woods and dim lighting make for a most intimate and romantic feel, though it can get a little loud due to the high ceilings at peak times.  Cuisine is primarily European-inspired with an emphasis on local-sourcing.  But the Southern influence is noticeable throughout, especially in the veggie offerings and vinegar-based barbecue sauce.  Like a finer European restaurant, the concept is smaller dishes, with a big emphasis on flavor, texture, and/or presentation. Again, the idea is dining as a full sensory experience.  Fries cooked in truffle oil, buttered butter beans, house-made gnocchi.  Even the cheese and charcuterie boards have some interesting picks. Surprise find for me- chicken liver mousse.  I'm not a liver eater, by any means, but I'd put this smooth operator on crunchy toast any day of the week.  All this said, I don't find Rooster's pretentious at all: servers are happy to take time with you and will gladly take back anything that does not appeal and offer a substitution.  The menu also includes a full range of staples for the not so adventurous.    Wine is almost a must here due to the voluminous wine offerings and the captain's list.  Broad enough to appeal to just about any palette and price point, the selections are well known by the educated severs who can help you pick.  They will also let you sample any wine sold by the glass before pouring a regular serving.  A small selection of microbrews and a full bar complete the drink offerings.  Bottom line: If you are into large portions, and favor quantity for your buck, you will leave here disappointed.  If, though, you look to quality and overall experience, I find Rooster's has it in spades.",

Also, this is my fourth time eating at Roosters, but my fist time eating lunch, and my first time back in several years.  Each time that I've eaten dinner at Roosters I've greatly enjoyed my food and experience....until now.  A group from work decided to grab lunch at the South Park location today.  While the menu options looked great, the food itself was not.  We started off with a few appetizers: calamari and fried livers.   The calamari also tasted undercooked as it was soggy and not very crispy.  The bigger issue was the livers, which were okay until I realized what I had just eaten was still uncooked with blood dripping from the center of the liver.  I let the server know and they removed this item from the bill.  I'm not sure what type of response I expected, I just thought that the reaction and response, or lack there of, wasn't adequate knowing that a customer had just ingested undercooked chicken.  For my meal, I asked the server for his recommendation.  He told us, \"without a doubt\" the prime rib sandwich is the way to go.  So, several of us ordered the prime rib sandwich, which was one of the specials.  To make a long story short, it was not good.  It wasn't terrible, just not what I would expect from a Jim Noble restaurant, or from a sandwich that cost over $15.  Also, the side Caesar salad was very mediocre.  All in all, I was very disappointed with Roosters.  Hopefully, I won't also end up with food poisoning to accompany the disappointment.",

There was a huge bar area, so I could definitely see myself coming back with a friend to split a few small plates and have a glass of wine at the bar late one weeknight.  I love small plates--I really enjoy being able to pick both a meat and a vegetable.  And, by pairing small dishes, my meal came out to be quite reasonable--I had the macaroni and green beans, and it ended up being under $15 before tax, tip, alcohol.  The green beans were wonderful - tender and perfectly cooked.  And it was a huge portion!  I definitely had leftovers, and two people could have easily split them (I guess that's why they're \"sides\").  The macaroni and cheese was really good too!  I love a well-made macaroni so I continually order it at restaurants, and end up disappointed most of the time because it lacks flavor.  I wasn't disappointed here!  The macaroni was rich, but not just creamy.  Everyone else I was with really enjoyed their food--most of us got a salad or vegetable and another of the small plates, and we found it the perfect amount of food.",

Our waiter was very friendly and spent time with us going over the menu. He was attentive, brought us everything we asked for and offered to replace my soup when I didn't like it. He gets the 1 star I gave here.   Here's my list of the bad: - What the hell is that wall of dead birds?  - The wood fired beets - tasted more like rubber lumps, no wood fired taste.  - The pan fried corn - yes, it's pan fried corn, my bad for expecting some spices in there.  - The onion soup - overly salty and has a strong, unidentifiable flavor.  - The scallops - nothing special at all. - The prices - for what we paid, I would expect to be spoon fed while being fanned with palm leaves. Really a said combo of inflated prices and mediocre food you could prepare at home for nothing.  And be forewarned: Everything is a la carte. Ordering scallops? That's $20, and then you may add a side for $7. What a joke.   Bring a fat wallet  of money you were thinking of setting on fire and low expectations and you should leave happy.",

Our bartender was a funny, funny man who makes a killer gimlet. They have a wide selection of wine and alcohol. And a great seating area in front of the bar.   Watching the chefs in the open kitchen made me drool a little bit. I'm eating there soon. Who wants to join??",

The service here was great but the seating was a bit awkward where my girlfriend and I sat.  I have to mention it because it was really noticeable.  The table was a solid six inches away from both of us so it made for a weird eating arrangement to say the least.    I wouldn't let that deter you from eating here at all though.

Or, don't be afraid to ask your server to explain a bunch of things to you.  I sure did when I couldn't decide between 5 items!  The dressing on my wedge salad was really salty, but I'm guessing that's not normal.  I was so hungry I didn't say a word and ate it anyways.  The mushroom pizza is amazing!",

Venue - I saw the establishment first from inside the plaza like indoors - and thought it looked a bit.. old.  But yesterday, I had came in from the front and was relieved and surprised to see such a nice set up.  Okay, the roosters on the left side of the wall is a bit much.  I will not let that deter me from what else is to come.   Service - Good.  I had a waitress who took care of my friends and I.   Food - As others have mentioned, not ground breaking.  I was anxious about what I should order. The obvious being, chicken!  But I just did not feel for chicken last night. So I had help from Yelp's tips and reviews and I have ordered:  - Mac n' Cheese: Good, hot and piping good.  Cheesy and delicious.  What I ordered on my own - Fried Oyster: It was okay.  I asked for an honest opinion that it is to die for, but.. it was mediocre. - Lobster Bisque: It was good. Not bad  Price - It was a little pricey, hence I avoided the Scallop entree (which I normally ALWAYS get). I just cannot bring myself to pay $19 + sides.. just.. not worth it to me. And the Yelpers helped steered me away from it.   I left feeling content.  Would I come back, meh.  If my friends wanted me to come meet them up, I would.",

Service was fantastic and the atmosphere was enjoyable however I just wouldn't come back here again based on my poor food experience and high price tag. There are other quality restaurants I'd spend 30% less, not have to wait to share a bathroom, and have more quality seasoned food in this area.",

One of those times was at a table near the bar, which was fun because the bartender was sommelier-ish and was able to recommend some delicious wines off their list.  Every time I've been, I've had the burger, medium rare (awesome).  The brussels sprouts, mushrooms, and asparagus are all great.  I've sampled the pork shoulder and it's very good.  I didn't find the prices to be particularly outrageous, but I don't have much experience dining in Charlotte, so I can't really speak to that.  All in all, I'd recommend going here if you're in the mood for some yummy wood-fired a la carte food.",

They served it with some slaw, and man this is the second time I've had slaw that tastes expensive. I also ate this arugula tomato salad.  It tasted fresh, the flavors went well together, and I liked the bits of cucumber with it.  It said the tomatos were sliced liek carpaccio which I thought my tomatos would be thinly sliced but they were about 1cm thick.  It's ok. I forgive them.  I had the dessert special after the waitress suggested it to me which was this apple bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream... that... wasn't um great. I felt like I was scooping up butter.  It actually smelled like butter too.  I took like 5 bites and I just couldn't stomach it any longer.  Good news though, the waitress asked how it went and when I told her I wasn't a fan, she waived it!  I would have given this place 3 stars if the dessert wasn't waived but since it was, and since I know that the bread pudding isn't usually on the menu.. 4 stars!",

Hanging at the bar was better with appetizers and wine: try the calamari for sure. The wine-by-glass list was largely very decent and reasonably priced. But getting kicked out at 11 because the place was closing was a bit of a drag. This place gets super-crowded on Saturday nights, so they must be doing something right, but I'm not quite sure what that is, or what the whole stuffed cocks on the wall thing is (I mean roosters, you pervs!)",

A little insulting. We ordered our food then and the salads came quickly but they were finished and we waited a long time for our entrees. Finally asked the waiter and he said the kitchen forgot the hamburger which held him up.  Food finally came and all was good except the CORN that everyone raved so about....it was terrible.

I was at the Southpark mall and wanted something relatively close which Roosters was. My first impression upon walking in was great. The hostess was friendly, loved the kitchen in the center and liked the different decor (stuffed roosters on one wall). My waiter was friendly and helpful, explaining the menu, how everything was local and giving me his advice on some menu items. I took his advice and got the duck confit, getting the asparagus as a side. When it came out, everything looked gorgeous. The asparagus was grilled, was a tad firm, but not at all chewy with a great taste. The duck was fantastic! I got full but hated to leave any of it left on my plate because it was so amazing. It had a great sauce, a nice crisp skin and was LITERALLY fall off the bone tender. Not kidding, I pulled on the bone when I cut into it, and the bone came out totally clean. I love duck, and that was one of the best duck meals I've ever had. Next time im in the area, I'll be back. I got those who meal items and a sweet tea and my total was just under 30 bucks, so not cheap, but I was full and pleased. I feel like for a once-in-a-while great meal, it was well worth it.",

    "text": "Ate here for lunch over the weekend. Service was great!  No complaints there.  However, the food was a bit disappointing.  I thought the price should reflect a higher quality of food.  Ordered tomato soup bisque which was really good.  For the salad with scallops, the avocado that was on the menu as being a part of the salad, was actually guacamole blobs around the plate.  It tasted like they got too ripe so they blended it and squirted it on the plate.  The dressing wasn't bad, scallops were cooked pretty well but with only 3, I felt it needed a 4th to complete the large arugula portion.  My husband ordered the Vietnamese sandwich, which wasn't quite there either.  The pomme frites were on the larger side but a bit softer, not as crisp than I would imagine for pomme frites.  Overall, for the money, wasn't worth it to me and felt that Firebird's one block down had better food for the price.",

As a couple, or in a larger group, we've never had a bad experience at Roosters. I'm truly amazed that I have read some negative reviews. Everything is ala carte with reasonable prices. I don't usually eat chicken, but have had theirs, both regular and BBQ, and have found it to be exceptionally good. My favorites are the short ribs (very tender and flavorful) and the onion soup (incredibly rich). When it's offered, which is only when they can get a special local tomato in season, the BLT is absolutely wonderful. Service is exceptional, team approach with some taking order, others delivering the food. The roosters on the wall are interesting and a unique decor. An excellent choice for groups (they have a second set of tables across the hall) and I don't think you can go wrong eating here. My one negative is that the corned beef hash on Sunday brunch is not your typical hash, not bad, but not at all what I expected (so there, I can find some fault, but really had to work at it).",

My friend and I had the quarter chicken natural, which was fine, but on the small side. It was tasty enough, but not particularly juicy ( the kind of moist chicken that I would expect for $11). My wife ordered the \" famous\" six small shrimp for $17. Seriously?  We also ordered three sides - the corn, the beats and the succotash - all were fine but not unique in any way.  Since we split the bill with our friend, my part was $45 and some change for the chicken, 6 shrimp and two rather small sides. We left feeling a bit hungry.  There are many, many more excellent restaurants in the area where $45 + tip would have gotten us a more interesting and unique meal for that amount. Cafe Monte on Fairview, Upstream, and Village Tavern immediately come to mind.  Bottom line: food didn't have any pizazz, the prices were way out of line and we'll not likely give Roosters our patronage in the future. Just too many other good places in the South Park area",

The reason I thought it was overpriced was because for a side bowl of asparagus it costed $10 and the other $6-$8 sides were small for their pricing. The only other reason it too pricy was because the cornish hen was $24.        I thought the food was great. I got the cornish hen. It was prepared in three different ways: flash fried, seared, and baked (as the waitress informed us)! It was also served with carrots, carrot puree, and as well as purple potatoes.        Overall the food was great, and although it was a bit pricy, it was worth the cost.",

But overlook it you must, because just inside the unimpressive facade waits one of Charlotte's best dining experiences.  From the delicious calamari to the signature roasted chicken and beef short rib, everything about our meal was outstanding. But the best part may have been the check -- with perfectly portioned entrees at reasonable prices, Rooster's may be one of the Queen City's best values in upscale dining.

    "text": "We started off the night with the house caesar salad and the roasted chicken pizza. The caesar salad was decent but just a little light on the caesar dressing. Aside from the burnt crust the roasted chicken pizza was one of the better parts of the night. The toppings were flavorful and had it not been burnt it may have been an excellent pizza.  For her entree Ella got the Potato gnocchi with a rabbit confit. The gnocchi was light, fluffy, came with a really  delicious sauce and a crispy confit. Our only complaint with this dish was the ridiculously small size. For an $11 pasta we were expecting a full bowl that would be a hearty dinner. What we got instead was hardly big enough to be an appetizer.  I got the steak burger for my entree which may have been alright.. had it not been served nearly raw. When the waiter asked how I liked my burger to be cooked I replied \" medium well \"instead it came out juicy, red, and bloody with a light sear. I also got a side of Pan Fried Corn which was one of the better dishes of the night. My burger came with a side of onion rings which were greasy, lightly battered, and not worth finishing.  Ella got the Caramel Cake for dessert and after one bite declared it inedible. For my perspective it was extremely sweet and had the texture of pure butter. I went with the Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch Cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream because I wanted to compare it with the one we got at the Kings Kitchen a few weeks ago. The final verdict.. a lot of chocolate, not enough peanut butter crunch, and the ice cream melts way to fast to be enjoyed throughout the dish.  We didn't like Roosters much and for the time being can't recommend that anyone waste their time trying it. If you love it.. thats great, but for the creepy rooster wall, dim lighting, burnt food, raw food, and small portions we cant recommend it.",

OK lots of roosters -and a pheasant- on the wall with high ceilings and dark wood mixed with stone for atmosphere. I thought it was nice.  My sister went for the Gluten Free menu and had the Rooster wings which were so tasty that I wasn't offer even one! I had the chicken fried woods mushrooms ( a bit bland but the dipping sauce was great.) My sis's husband had the onion soup which must have been good 'cause nobody was offered a sip and it was gone is 60 seconds. He had scallops for main course (4,) quite rich. I had a chicken quarter. Everything was elegantly served, the wait staff was very attentive, the deserts were something (my sister's pear sorbet was exceptional.) A nice dinner can easily exceed $50 per person, but  it qualifies as a culinary experience to be properly savored- not just a meal.",

    "text": "Went here with my parents last evening to celebrate my mom's birthday. Since I was with my parents, dinner was on the early side at 4:00. We were greeted and immediately seated at a booth near the entrance. I was charmed by the rustic, industrial feel of the restaurant that included little doses of whimsy thanks to the frequent placing of roosters.  Our waiter came over to go over the menu. Roosters serves its sides a la carte, similar to a tapas style restaurant. They recommend getting an appetizer, a protein and sharing the sides.  My mom ordered the quarter natural chicken with fingerling potatoes, I ordered the smoked wings with pan fried corn, and my dad ordered the shrimp with fingerling potatoes. Unfortunately, this type of restaurant was out of the norm for my parents. When it comes to cuisine they are not adventurous at all. My mom liked her meal, she just wished that it came with more aus jus for her chicken. As for the shrimp my dad ordered, he received a plate of SIX, small shrimp that cost $17. SIX SHRIMP FOR SEVENTEEN DOLLARS. These weren't jumbo shrimp or anything like that. Just six, small grilled shrimp in a light sauce. All we could do was laugh because it looked ridiculous. I'm surprised the waiter was able to serve that with a straight face. A grown man served six shrimp. Just let that picture settle in for you. Thankfully, my order of smoked wings was a very hefty portion and I was able to share some with him. But seriously Rooster? take the shrimp off the menu. You're not doing anyone any favors with that option.  Honestly, if you come as duo, ordering the smoked wings is good bet because it's a bowl of at least 8-9 good-sized wings. The corn had a nice bite and flavor. The fingerling potatoes were OK, I would've preferred the yukon puree (aka mashed potatoes) but they weren't serving them at the time for some reason. As for the complimentary bread, it tasted stale and we were finally served it after sitting for a while.  The waiter seemed distracted even though it wasn't that busy.  Suffice it to say, my dad now has a good dining story to tell. Trust me, he's been telling EVERYONE he knows about how he was served a plate of six shrimp (for $17). Can't say that I'll personally be back as I wasn't blown away by the food and I don't like visiting a restaurant that's only serving certain things at certain times.",

We also enjoyed the chef special duck that was marinated in salt pepper sugar and its duck fat juices overnight. The duck was tender and full of flavor.  The next dish we had was one of the regular dishes  chicken that is rotisserie in the huge Italian brick oven and glazed over with light bbq sauce  that was a great combination of sweet and tangy. To complete our delightful  meal we had four sides smash potato, spinach , roasted beets, grits, and mac and cheese.

Lastly, the lunch menu had just enough selection so we weren't overwhelmed. We will definitely come back with family for special occasions, or just for the Mac and Cheese service!",

A diverse menu crafted with care. Full bar with house cocktails that honor trends and blaze trails at the same time.   The bar is long. Bar tables are long, high tops of stately wood often shared with other patrons.  In the dining section, many booths and wall tables providing a booth-like privacy add to the charm and splendor of Rooster's.  Rooster's menu varies often because they focus on what is fresh and available, and what is in season. I've not loved every dish I have tried, but that's a matter of personal taste rather than quality or preparation.",

    "text": "I really want to love this place, but now I've tried SP and Uptown and I just can't stand behind them. Since it's small plates (for not a small price) menu/a la carte model, I've tried quite a bit of things here ranging from daily specials to trusted/all the time items. I can't say I've really ever loved one thing very much. First red flag when going to a nice restaurant is when you can see a block of butter sitting on top of your sea food. It doesn't take a genius to realize butter makes everything taste good, so if you just drown your food in butter your guests are sure to love it. I realize that's common for veggies and for lower end restaurants, but I really expect more at an establishment that is bordering a nice dining experience. Their ambiance and decor is spot on, as it gives the illusion you're at a really fancy place, but the food is just not great. What happened to being inventive with flavor parings? Savory and sweet and getting creative? Literally 3/5 dishes I got were simply drowned in butter. The cauliflower special was decent, but it was literally charred cauliflower with loads of a Parmesan type cheese shredded over it. Second oldest trick in the book, douse your food in cheese and it magically tastes great. I could have gone to a Mexican restaurant if I was looking to get that. The best dish was the bok choy special, as it had sausage and another suspicious oil base it was submerged in, but I did actually like the sausage flavor (even it I doubt it even had 5 leaves of bok choy). I think if the price were much lower you'd understand what you were getting into, but overall I felt fat and stuffed after leaving, and didn't particularly love anything. The duck I had before was way too gamey, and they had no flavorful sauce to challenge the taste. Same with hangar steak this time, the sauce was literally worse that just eating the meat plain. Not sure if they do any marinating or dry rubs (highly doubt it since it literally tasted plain) but that would be a good thing for them to get into. I gave them 3 because they support farmers and have nice ambiance, but the food deserves a 2. The waitress had literally no personality and we might as well have had a robot wait on us. If that was the case, I'll bet the robot would have been more responsive and attentive. It took 2 of us (who actually were trying to hurry) over an hour for us to leave (clock starting after we were seated). It was very late on a Thursday and hardly anyone else there. I think waiting 15 minutes after bringing water to return may have been the first set back, but also only bringing beans for the first 20 minutes after ordering is what probably did us in. I any case, definitely recommend Bricktops which is right around the corner, and I've yet to have a bad meal in the 6x I've gone, and they are very similar in pricing. I think they pride themselves on cocktails and had a lot of wines, spend $90 this time without even trying any. Ouch.",

    "text": "Rooster not to be confused with Chef Marcus Samuelson restaurant Red Rooster in Harlem, NY is a refreshing take on Southern open kitchen dining with a refreshing menu and True Southern hospitality staff. While in SouthPark the family and I usually steer toward the typical four restaurants and one day we decided to randomly select and try something different after shopping and Yelp popped up Rooster and we said since it was first in the results we would try. Today marked our second visit and each time we were HAPPY. Our first visit yielded memorable items in which we repeated one of them = the dessert of desserts Coconut Cream Cake. This cake is not your typical cake it's cool in temperature and extreme in flavor with layers of awesomeness and a MUST HAVE. Our FAVORITE apps include the avocado toast it's so flavorful with cilantro and pickled red onions and the fried oysters. The oysters are fried to perfection and the sauce is full of flavor. This place is one of the very few places that give you a nice amount of fried oysters in your order which is a plus.  Tonight I tried the grouper over fingerling potatoes and a confee which was tasty, the potatoes and veggies more than anything because the fish was sorta over cooked but still tasty. If it was cooked a little less it would've been perfect. My hubby had the hanger steak which he wasn't too impressed with its flavor. He did however enjoy his duck tenders and the roasted corn side it was amazing. I Love the decor and have me thinking if all those roosters on the wall are real stuffed roosters Hmmm. Well if so cock a doodle do LoL  Great place with friendly staff",

The pimento cheese & bread was great! We used the soup almost as a sauce . Lol I had the shrimp & grits ( which are the large fluffy hominy ones btw) nice husband got the meat loaf he is particular about but said this was very good . Others got a hamburger &  the spit roasted chicken is large , tender & tasty! The atmosphere is cool with a open kitchen concept. The wait staff & management are attentive ! There is a wall celebrating Rooster's of all breeds. So vegans might not appreciate but I get it & thought it was quite unique . There is an enclosed courtyard area? Did take pics at this place ( sorry should have! ) atmosphere is relaxed rustic with some antiques . Tip- at brunch you can order eggs & things that aren't on the menu. Just ask",

Well with a 2 1/2 hour wait on a Saturday night (I should have expected that) we ended up going to Rooster's instead and I was not disappointed.   Rooster's is an interesting place. We opted for sitting at the bar that looks into the wood fire cooking area. Twas a little warmer but we were famished and didn't want to wait for a table. Everything is a la carte so you have a good amount of options on what you can order. I'm a sucker for trying new cheeses so I was really close to getting the pick three option until one of the chefs in the cooking area told me you only get an ounce each. That would not do for my level of hunger. Instead I got the fire roasted chicken wings. I almost embarrassed myself for how fast I tore them apart. They were smoky, flavorful, and so delicious. Along with a side of spinach I was completely satisfied.   One day when I'm rolling in the dough I'll come back to this place to enjoy all the things I wanted on the menu...aka all the cheese!",

My advice is to drive a couple more blocks to Bricktop and get better food and service.   This time was during lunch with the place about 1/4 full (not very busy).  Table of four people. We were perfunctorily seated.  We waited 5 minutes for a server to come and fill the water glasses. He did say our waiter would arrive shortly. We waited another five minutes for him to show up.  Then he asked if we wanted anything else to drink. One member of the party asked to see the beer menu (more waiting).  Brought the beer menu and left. (More waiting)  Showed up later and took the drinks order. (Waited some more but not too long). Drinks arrived.  Waited some more and he brought the menus.  Waited some more and he took the appetizer order. Appetizers came out in a reasonable timeframe. Took our entree order but when one person wanted something he was told they were out of that and two other entree items (could of mentioned that when he gave the menus).  Food came out in a reasonable timeframe but the waiter did not clear the appetizer plates or the empty beer bottles on the table. (Which had been available for several minutes).  Just placed the entrees and left.  A few minutes later he came and cleared the appetizer plates but left the empty beer bottles!   Some food  was ok but one member of the party said his meal was really bad and left most of his food on the plate (he is a college student and tolerant of college fare so this says something). Entree plates were cleared fairly promptly but the empty beer bottles remained on the table.  Water glasses were filled at good intervals. Check arrived at a reasonable timeframe.   I seldom write poor reviews but this experience warranted it.  Due to the food quality, poor service and portion size for price. I recommend you not go here",

We went there a little while ago for no real reason--we hadn't heard too much about it or anything, but it seemed appealing and new. Again, it's hard to pin down what they're serving up, except to say that it was all pretty good. The place itself is really nice--very large and wide open, with modern tables and such. I like this kinda place--doesn't seem chain-y or anything.   As for the food, it was good, not transcendent. Lots of small plates and options like that. I actually enjoyed the pizza the most, although it was all pretty decent. At our table of three, I think 3 or 4 national cuisines were sampled, if that makes sense.   Great wine list, too.",

    "text": "Sometimes you enter a restaurant with certain expectations. Sometimes these expectations are derived from reviews online, sometimes friends' praises, and other times it's by coming upon the restaurant itself and gauging the quality of food simply through the interior design/ambience. Upon entering, and seeing the open kitchen right in the middle of the restaurant, I thought to myself, \"I'm in for a scrumptious dinner.\"  The walls were adorn with a number of prismatic stuffed cocks, and everything else looked trendy and clean. The restaurant was so busy that there were no available seating inside the restaurant. So the four of us opted to sit outside instead. This restaurant apparently has a huge winelist. Were I a wine drinker, I would've appreciated it very much. Alas, I am not a drinker of wine due to a lack in a certain required sophistication, thus I did not appareciate the wine list. In fact it made the menu very confusing. Yes, I am dumb I couldn't figure out the menu at first.   The menu items are moderately priced. $$ according to yelp  price range. The wait staff was attentive and got to our order fairly quickly. To start we ordered smoked salmon and fried oysters. The fried oysters came with a side of marinara sauce and the breading was perfect. The oysters itself was very fresh and juicy. The smoked salmon was smoked well and subtly flavored. The only complaint I have regarding the salmon is that it could've been chilled a little bit more. It was a little warm. Typically I like raw fish to be slightly colder.   I ordered the Quarter chicken dark done natural style. They got me with their rotisserie chicken going round and round in the back of the chicken. Plus, with a name like Roosters, got to try their chickens. I also ordered a side of mac and cheese because my friend swore it tasted like it was made by our lord and savior JC.   I was not at all impressed with the chicken. In fact my first thought when I tasted it was, \"Boston Market is much better\" But, to give them credit, they use organic or locally raised chicken, so that does affect the texture of the meat making it slightly tougher than caged chicken. So that is excusable, however it was certainly lacking in flavor.   The mac and cheese was good, but not mind blowing. One of my friends had onion rings. Those were some good onion rings. The breading was flavorful and the rings very thin and delicious. The spinach was very well done as well. My other friend had the mussels and he loved it.   Portion size wasn't an issue because I wasn't all that hungry.   I think this is one of those cases where I ordered the wrong dishes. I should try other, more exotic items like seafood or breaded dishes since their breading is so good. I'll update their rating next time I visit the restaurant. However, for now, I'll have to give them 3 stars.",

If I order range-fed chicken, I don't expect the whole bird, but i DO expect more than a baseball size piece of meat with artistic drawings/arrangements on the plate for $15. You consistently get some of the worst reviews of any Southpark eatery..WAKE UP before you CLOSE UP!",

First all of our meals come out except for one...it finally was delivered 5 minutes late. My husband ordered the large pork chop which was served cold and raw in the middle. The restaurant staff insisted it was cooked medium as ordered. Finally they took it back, and brought back the same pork chop which was still not cooked. Again, they insisted it was cooked correctly. No one wants to eat raw pork for obvious reasons. The prommes frites came out cold as if they had been sitting out all night. Those had to go back...the fresh ones were good. My husband ordered a Cabernet and was brought some red blend wine. We were afraid to say anything at this point. Ruined my birthday dinner with friends to say the least. Frosting on the cake...only one women's  bathroom stall was opened for entire restaurant so had to go to Walgreens down the street to use restroom because there were so many people in line to use the one at restaurant. Also food was delivered and it took us a while to flag some one down to bring us forks so we could eat. Oh ...well after some complaining and returning pork chop for the third time we got pork chop comped. Don't waste your money on this poorly managed restaurant. Go to Dresslers, Vivace, Carpe Diem or one of the other of comparable restaurants in Charlotte. By the way, the manager never came over to our table. Too busy.",

Mac and cheese, roasted beets, corn, onion rings are fantastic.  The BLT isn't on the lunch menu, but with heirloom tomatoes, fantastic bread, and thick-cut bacon, this is hard to pass up. I also adore the chicken, arugula and apple salad at lunch. The service is amazing and the wine list is fantastic. Let your waiter talk you into a Spanish wine on the list or take part in the $2.50 glass during the week-such a great deal!",

You're greeted by a great smoky aroma, undoubtedly from the spinning spit fire roasted meats. We started with mussels, a special that day, which were great. We order mussels as an appetizer practically everywhere, and these lived up to our standards. I had the hanger steak, and my husband had the chicken, we also ordered the au gratin potatoes and haricot verts. Everything was great - though the highlight for me may have been the potatoes, I finished every last potato piece on the plate. They were truly decadent, and should probably be limited to a rare treat due to how creamy and cheesy they tasted.The haricot verts were also good, but slightly hard to eat because everything was served either on a very small plate or in a large, deep bowl, leaving no space to use to cut up the beans. Over all, very delicious and I'm sure we'll return!",

The waitress and the hostess were as nice as could be... unfortunately it didn't make up for the MICROSCOPIC portions of food we got for dinner.  Honestly, I don't think I have EVER been to a restaurant with portions this tiny.....  I think they are catering to gnomes.  It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't so expensive, but it was VERY overpriced for what you get... the food was ok.... sorta tasty, but my dinner was a bit salty, my husband and daughter had the tiny microscopic Hanger steak, which they liked, but again, we walked out starving. There are too many great places in Charlotte to eat where you can get you're money's worth.  Go there instead.",

It was nice that they were very tender, but were lacking flavor. Others at our table had the Duck and BBQ Chicken, and surprisingly, we all agreed that everything was bland.  Another disappointment was the over-priced average wine. For our experience, and what we were expecting (from another recommendation) it was certainly way over-priced and not worth it. The worst part was the waiter we had - he seemed to try to rush us through our decisions and seemed slightly irritated when we asked questions. The manager on duty was nice and stopped by to check on us. All in all, I'm guessing we had one of those \"bad nights\", and unfortunately, walked away without a reason to return.  For the dollar, there are many other restaurants we'd choose over this one.",
