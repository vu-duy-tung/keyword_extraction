They were charming, attentive, funny, and overall just great servers. We could not have asked for a better experience. The food was also wonderful. I would highly recommend the scallops, the gratin potatoes, and the sea bass. Thank you Eddie V's, for making this dinner a remarkable experience for all!",

Phenomenal cocktail engineer, Mariah, took special care for not only my girlfriend and I, but also about 40 other guests at the same time. She made what looks to be a very stressful environment, into a beautiful dance highlighted by the amazing live jazz band playing in the background. The entire staff were the most kind, gracious, friendly and helpful people I have experienced in a Charlotte restaurant. From the hostess walking me to the restroom instead of giving general directions, to the server asking how my day has been (while holding a full tray of food) this first time experience was the BEST dining experience I've had this year! We will be regulars at Eddie V's, every Tuesdays!",

The service was atrociously slow, and the food mediocre at best.  Our server, who knew we were celebrating anniversaries, couldn't have cared less.  I would not send my worst enemy to Eddie V's.  At their prices, good luck to them surviving.",

    "text": "Eddie V's was phenomenal from beginning to end. I was first impressed with the high tech (cell phone based system) valet parking. Once you step in the ambiance was exquisite and picture perfect. Although, you'll need some additional lighting for selfies b/c it's a bit dark. My group of servers (team model) were very attentive and thoughtful. They offered great pairing recommendations. I had the crab cake appetizer and the Ribeye with the crab stuffed shrimp accompaniment. My friend had the lobster tacos and sea bass (which I sampled). The sides come a la carte so one of our servers recommended doing 2 smaller portioned sides. So we opted for the crab fried rice and au gratin cheddar potatoes. Everything (minus the shrimp) was superb! I'm a lover of crab stuffed shrimp and theirs was okay. Theirs came with plenty of crab, still I've had better. I paired my meal with a nice Malbec. I highly recommend Eddie V's and will definitely go back. Their happy hour menu is next on my list.",

The live jazz is a nice touch that adds to whole feel and experience.  The food was great from the organic greens, to the steak and truffle mashed potatoes to finally my dessert which was banana foster cake. I would definitely recommend. I got the 22 Oz rib eye bone in, and it was the best steak I've ever had.",

    "text": "My rating is exclusively based on price - and what my expectations are for when you get into the $100-$150 per person category of restaurants. For the price; you have dozens of other options in Charlotte. The wine list and venue are great. Wait staff are in white jackets and there was live music both times we visited. The first occasion was shortly after opening and we credited their issues to being new - but for a $55 crab-topped steak, you shouldn't be picking out shells. The second time was a bit worse with food coming out of the kitchen very inconsistently, 3 of our 5 guests had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the food to come out after the other 2 entrees were served. Personally did not like the lobster mashed potatoes - whereas I'll go out of my way to Del Frisco's lobster mac and cheese which is executed better.  Again, at this price point, you can go to Ruth's Chris or Capital Grille and get a more consistent and exceptional experience.",

Starting with cocktails at the bar to the seafood tower which blew our socks off to an incredible set of entrees and delicious desert it was the BEST MEAL we've had in Charlotte. Our server assistant, Tyler, made the experience. He was friendly, attentive, considerate, and all around one of the best waiters we've had. He truly made the evening incredible. Our bartender, Mallory, made the best martini I've had in Charlotte as well. Everything about the restaurant was incredible. The food was incredible and the wine selection sealed the deal. We could not have imagined a better evening on the town and I will recommend this restaurant to anyone. Thank you for an incredible evening and a huge thank you to Mallory, Tyler, and Bren (the manager) who took extra special care of us this evening. I look forward to coming back again soon.",

It was my birthday and they gave me a rose and a birthday card. I decided to try the swordfish steak, it was prepared perfectly, great flavor! My husband had the salmon oscar style, we chose sauteed spinach which was incredible and bursting with flavor we also chose the lobster mac and cheese GREAT! The music smooth jazz live band live singer, not to cheesy or uptight and most importantly not to loud! The decor was nice with a romantic feel. I would recommend this place for date night, girls night out, private events as they have a private room! The drinks were great I tried the 25 Karate drink, awesomeness! The wine selection was great much to choose from! I would not recommend this place for kids or those who are looking to do anything other than relax.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Charlotte Eddie V's for the first time on Thursday.  Several of our friends went during the first week and said they had a terrible dining experience.  We thought we would wait and hopefully they would work out the kinks.  Nope.  We had a horrible experience.  Waited far too long for our cocktails.  Far too long for our appetizers and far too long for our entrees.  Forgot our sides as well.  How does THAT happen??!! We had the Osetra caviar and oysters for appetizers.  Couldn't really mess that up.  Entrees were just ok.  Can get a better steak elsewhere.  King crab was not great.  Service was disorganized.  You would think that since this is a chain, they would have a great training program.  We sat at the bar, like many friends suggested because they had bad dining room service.  No excuses about sitting at the bar to dine.  We sit at the bar at The Palm and Capitol Grille all the time.  No issues.  The poor man next to us was trying to get one of the 3 bartenders to look his way so he could pay his bill!  He waited over 10 minutes!  There was no way they didn't notice him waving his hands.  When we finally were acknowledged, I pointed out the man next to us trying to pay his tab.  Also, I ordered the duet champagne.  Poured my second champagne (different champagne) in the same glass and I still had champagne in it.   My husband waited almost 15 minutes for his bottle of wine.  Apparently, there was some confusion about where the bottle was....???! The bar had 4 empty seats.  So not super busy. We soooo wanted to love this new restaurant, but it was not at all a great experience.   Nothing stood out.  It's cool looking and nice to go somewhere with live music, but that's the only positive that we took away from our experience.  Except, we did make a friend while sitting at the bar because she was complaining too.  Not kidding.   We probably won't be back.  We have our tried and True restaurants.  This place was just a confusing hassle.  Really too bad.",

Easy to converse with. Very knowledgeable about the food. Assisted with everything! The experience is just so phenomenal. The food itself is stellar. I had the 22oz Ribeye while my party and I also shared the crab fried rice, asparagus, and truffle mac and cheese. Wow is all I can say. Presentation, taste, how it was served, was just so captivating. It doesn't stop there! I had the bananas foster for dessert. I really don't eat desserts, because I don't really have a sweet tooth. However, this was one of the best desserts I ever had! It was sweet, salty, savory, everything I would want quite honestly. At the end of the night, I didn't realize that I left my car keys on the table. The server assistant Micheal, who was also very pleasant and polite-actually ran down the street to hand me my keys which I greatly appreciate. Definitely going here again. I highly recommend this place if you want an all around fulfilling experience. Thank you, Eddie V's.",

Well it was 2 end pieces of. Filet and 3 shrimp no scampi sauce at all! My husband had the 22 oz steak again no  Aujus sauce for the steak and the mash potatoes were not presentable.

Food is a little worse than Upstream, ambiance is a little better. Food is a little better than DelFrisco's, ambiance is a little worse. Service is slow, staff not knowledgeable about the wine, our order was a little wrong but they fixed it.   However, today I received an alert from my credit card that they overcharged me $129 above what I authorized on my credit card. I never recommend or eat at restaurants that try to rip me off, and I don't think you should eat at a place that would let this happen either. Although I have tried to get someone on the phone to correct it, and have sent emails to the restaurant, the problem has not been addressed at all. I will not be back. Overcharging by that much cannot be an accident.",

Everyone from the hostess, bartender, waiter and food runners were super friendly and top notch. The truffle mac n cheese is a definite must have. We ordered as side to share. The best decision ever besides dining here.",

Service was also very fast and professional.   The food was prepared well with the exception of the crab fried rice. It arrived to the table very cold and there were bits of shell in my crab taco but not much. Also the noodles in the truffle Mac and cheese were a little firm.  The sole was cooked perfectly as was the lump crab cake and the lobster mashed potatoes.   My biggest concern was with the 91 sanitation score. I noticed the score as i was leaving. I typically won't eat anywhere under a 96. Really curious to learn what violations the restaurant had to cause such a low score.",

    "text": "I went to this place because a good friend that travels to Charlotte with some frequency highly recommended it.   As a frequent visitor to Mastro's Ocean Club, I thought Eddie's was very similar to Mastro's in terms of the menu options and service provided. But the pricing is a little easier on the wallet.  I got their Norwegian Salmon and my husband got the Bacon Wrapped Filets \"Oscar\" Style. Both were quite delicious, had a great flavor pairings, and went well with the side of Truffle Macaroni and Cheese. Both of us thought the the Mac and cheese was similar to our favorite Mastro's side, their black truffle gnocchi.   For dessert we had the Banana Foster Butter Cake. Now since my husband and I are HUGE Mastro butter cake fans, I was thoroughly blown away by how close in texture and flavor Eddie V's cake was to their's. The banana foster topping was a perfect compliment to the buttery rich goodness of the warm cake and the pecan ice cream. And how can you not like something served a flambe!   All of that to say, if you are a familiar with Mastro's you'll feel right at home at Eddie V's.",

My vodka gimlet was unbalanced and was too heavy on the lime. The volume on the live music was good, audible but not overpowering conversation.   When we were seated we had a little extra decoration for the special occasion.   Our waiter was friendly and informative. In general service was good.  I had the ceasar salad to start. It was well plated and tasted good. My fiance had the chowder which was delightfully rich with a nice hint of smoke.  My fiance got bacon wrapped filet oscar with king crab and asparagus with bearnaise. I ordered the swordfish cooked in olive oil with asparagus seasoned with lemon and salt. We added on a side of crab fried rice. The fried rice is without exception the best fried rice I have ever had. My swordfish was over and a little dry. The asparagus was grilled and pretty great. The bacon wrapped filet was a rare case of being a good bacon wrapped dish. The bacon added a nice smokey component to the filet.  For dessert I had \"Bananas Foster\" butter cake. My fiance had butterscotch pana cotta.  The bananas foster was exceptional. I skipped the pana cotta because I don't like butterscotch.   All in all, definitely worth a visit.",

We came here to celebrate my birthday and as excited as I already was to simply try this place out we found out upon arrival that it was also the week of Queens Feast! The ambiance is to die for! It is very intimate and the live music is my favorite piece to it. They walked us to our table where there was table confetti and a birthday card already propped up just for me. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio and were satisfied with what the queens feast menu had to offer. I started with the Caesar salad and moved to the swordfish with asparagus as a side and ended with the bananas foster because it was highly recommended. The staff really knows how to make their guests feel special as we had multiple visits to the table wishing me a happy birthday and making sure I was accommodated. He swordfish was very thick and amazing. It was filled with flavor and reminded me almost of a juicy steak. The only thing I would say that turned me off from this experience would be dessert. The Bacardi infused bananas foster had amazing presentation as they light it on fire in front of your face, but once the flame is gone and you taste it you may as well be scooping up moonshine to wash down all of the great tasting food away. It was very disappointing. I will try not to let this take away from my experience but it was definitely big enough to knock off one star from this place.",

The establishment itself is beautiful, my bartenders were professional and attentive, and their customer drinks were nice. Crowd was a mixed bag as there were some pretty uppity and pretentious people there, but also a mix of more down to earth people who made for some great convos around the bar. Next time I'll be sure to go when a different band is playing so I can have a chance of staying awake.",

    "text": "1st visit to Eddie V's, and it's their 1st participation in Charlotte Restaurant Week. I am a fair patron, I don't expect things to be perfect during madness. Some people say \"don't go during Restaurant Week\" but honestly I think this is the best time to see if a restaurant can be grace under fire. It also can showcase the level of service the place has to offer. And unfortunately for Eddie V's, it failed, in a big fat F sort of way.   Reservation for 5 at 7:45pm. We arrived on time. We know we wouldn't get a table at 7:45pm. For restaurant week, 30 minutes swing is reasonable and tolerable. But they offer no system (via cell, or buzzer, or anything) to receive updates. They sure did not go to the bar area to update us when the wait is exceeding 30 minutes. I shouldn't have to keep going back & forth asking for news because I wasn't at an IHOP. Fail #1 - poor communications with customers.   There were some high tops in the bar opening up, one would have sat 5. But did they offer it to us who have been patiently waiting and dying from hunger? No. They gave it to 2 people who I am sure came in after us. Fail #2 - poor table assignment management - at least gave us an option to sit at the bar when available.   Eventually after an hour plus, we were given a table. To be transparent, I was told the reason our table took so long was that the previous party had been occupying it since 5pm and just hanging out. Those people should be ashamed of themselves. Nonetheless the hostess lady told me that they would comp a round of drinks and denoted on the table notes. Waiter David never acknowledged our wait, or said anything about comping 1 round of drinks. Fail #3 - I should not have to tell the waiter how long we just waited and the fact that we were told a round of drinks is on the house (because someone should have whispered in his ears already even if he didn't see the notes).  We waited quite a while to receive our drinks. Long enough that my friend's old fashioned was looking a little light colored (from melted ice). We placed our food order. They ran out of crab & corn chowder, but luckily they had alternative soup offerings. Then eventually our entrees arrived. 4 out of 5 entrees arrived. No one acknowledged that we're missing a dish. We thought maybe it's just right behind the rest of us. But nothing, nada. We felt bad but we started to eat or our food would be cold. Eventually the 5th entree showed up, no mentioning as to how or why or the fact it went missing to start with. And it was way undercooked. So poor other friend of mine ate around the filet because he ordered medium (yes, medium, but that's a different topic) and it came out almost rare. And no one really checked with us after his entree was delivered. Fail # 4 - poor timing of food delivery and follow up.  Then David disappeared. Like we didn't even see him walking around in the dining room sort of disappeared. We are now 3 hours after our initial reservation, 45 minutes after the official closing time of the restaurant, empty tabled waiting for 3rd course. And we have not seen one manager walking by. It's like, let's pretend we didn't have service issues. We finally received our dessert AFTER I made a quick stop to the front hostess stand to inform the hostess that our waiter went MIA. Truth is that's when I found out our waiter's name because there wasn't much of an intro. Fail #5 - services got worse along the way, zero acknowledgement from anyone, including management.  Luckily the company was delightful and patient enough to wait out a 4 hour dinner. Food was great overall. My steak was cooked & seasoned perfectly. Lobster bisque was tasty (no actual lobster meat however). Panna cotta and butter cake were excellent. The catch of the day was cooked perfectly but lack seasoning/taste. But food itself can't make a high-end restaurant. And a high-end restaurant has to shine even when dealing with \"us poor folks\" that dine during Restaurant Week.  Again, I know this is Restaurant Week, and I know this is their 1st go-round, but they are owned by the same group that owns The Capital Grille. Last I checked CG was still excellent with dealing with the madness and offered excellent services. So do they not train the new spot with some talents from down the road? Because they should.   3-star is being nice, giving them a benefit of the doubt, considering the food quality and that everyone was friendly enough and no one was rude.",

    "text": "Really incredibly disappointed by the service provided during restaurant week. We had a large party reserved months ago to celebrate multiple birthday's. After waiting for over an hour for our table to be ready (which we were all understanding of and didn't even complain,) we were seated. Given all regular menu's so 30 minutes later when we were still waiting on Restaurant Week menus and asked about it wondering why 30 min later we still hadn't received those menus, a server pouring waters then barks back \"I don't know what you expect for service. You get restaurant week $35 service\" and kept ranting. I asked him to please leave, (he needed to cool off and really offended and angered me before it escalated) and he continued to go off. As we argued, because I refused to have someone continue talking to me like that, I asked for a manager. When she came in, she promptly walked to the head of the table and apologized to everyone for everything taking so long when I explained to her, it wasn't even that everything was taking so long, but it's the way we're being spoken to and reiterated what the server had been saying. To which he raised his voice and began arguing and one of the members of our party had to even get up and get in between him and our table to get him to calm down. He was angry I called him out to his manager right in front of him, but the way the manager approached it, I had no choice. This is an EMPLOYEE of the restaurant behaving this way and having to be blocked from our table and yelling at us by another member of the party!  The manager never removed him from our party the whole night and never said anything else about it. I would understand if we were a rambunctious party causing trouble, but that was not the case at all. I am honestly still just appalled as I sit here and write this and replay the whole scenario. I have never in my life gone to a restaurant, whether during a regular time or during Restaurant Week and been treated like this and management never batting an eye to improve the situation. Or be degraded for being a \"$35 Restaurant Week customer\" who shouldn't expect great service.   I truly don't believe Eddie V's is prepared to take part in something like Charlotte Restaurant Week and they completely ruined our birthday celebration as that behavior and attitude set the mood for the entire evening. The only words to describe our experience is disappointed and insulted.",

It makes for a light refreshing flavor but each element adds a nice texture. I could've ordered 3 more servings. The Chilean Sea Bass is steamed Hong King styled then settled in a light soy broth. Our dessert the banana foster was equally amazing and definitely had a wow factor to it since they pour all liquid on it and light it for you. So if you're a seafood lover and looking for a great date night you should definitely stop in. I highly recommend making a reservation as they stay pretty booked.

The beverages I tried were the dirty martini and the peach mule. Both were great! I had the scallops (seared perfectly) and a couple of other people had the bone in ribeye and they LOVED it. My favorite side was the lobster mashed potatoes. Thick chunks of lobster meat all throughout the dish. Our server was so pleasant as well! Also, some nights during the summer, they have live entertainment on the main level. The ambiance was absolutely perfect. It's worth every single penny you pay for the experience.",

We ordered steaks that were medium plus and we got rare. They took both steaks back and returned about ten minutes later with medium rare steaks. We had another guest who joined us and her steak was cooked to her liking, however, she never got to eat it because the girl in the lounge never brought her bernaise sauce so her steak was COLD by the time she finally got her sauce from a manager. All this to say, they only comped a dessert for a birthday. We still paid for the steaks that were not to our standards. Hopefully it was a bad night for them but I can say that the male manager(with dark hair) mocked our guest as we were paying our bill.",

Overall, the atmosphere is awesome...live music every night in the bar and great service. Try the lobster tacos as an appetizer...so delicious. We also loved the calamari. All of the food is very rich (a bit difficult to eat \"clean\" here), but absolutely worth the calories. Solid happy hour as well with some good deals, but definitely get there early to ensure you can snag a seat in the bar area.",

At one point the manager came over and said our food was taking so long because we ordered a 22 oz steak. My boyfriend was visibly upset and she said well it's only been 30 minutes. She knew we were waiting too long because she didn't say anything to any other tables. I feel her comment was unnecessary and borderline unprofessional. Our order may have been ENTERED 30 minutes prior in their system but we were waiting much longer. There wasn't a seamless transition between entrees  and I was expecting that at a restaurant of this caliber. Also our waitress wasn't necessary- the runners brought our food and retrieved her for drinks.   It took 20+ minutes for my first drink. I wanted to order another but said forget it when she was mia. I noticed tables around us came in after and left before us. Their waiters also had more of an interaction with the patrons. Maybe this was a bad night so I won't completely write them off but I was beyond pissed off with our service last night.",

The bisque was flavorful, rich and meaty. I spritzed s bit of lemon juice on the shrimp..my taste buds did a dance! Lastly, the bananas foster was decadent, buttery, crisp edges and it wasn't overtly sweet. Wonderful meal worth every cent!   This visit was made during happy hour. I noticed there were only older couples- no singles. Hopefully, a happy hours crowd of 30 plus age group begin to come out.  ** Ladies, please be aware the bathroom lighting is quite dim. Definitely not the place to adjust makeup. Please ensure you're perfect before leaving home!  I attached a bathroom selfie so you can get an idea..",

The food was great, I highly recommend the parmesan crusted sole and lobster mashed potatoes. But in regards to the quality of fine dining and prices you pay for this place, the service was not up to par.

We shared the lobster mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts as sides.  The smoked old fashioned was good, but the smoke was mostly gone by the time the drink was poured.

But without a doubt, what made our night so amazingly special was George Lee. He is, BY FAR, the best waiter we have ever encountered. He went above and beyond to make sure that we both felt special, and that we truly enjoyed ourselves. His jokes and commentary were hysterical, and he felt like an old friend the way he interacted with us. The complimentary valet parking was just an extra bit of icing on the top (but doesn't compare to the flaming bananas foster we had for dessert). 5 stars; no doubt.",

    "text": "First and foremost. Thank you for making my mom's birthday week so enjoyable. From the beginning our experience was excellent. We came for the Preview Night event. We were greeted at the door and were ushered into the lobby where the hostess welcomed us and gave us the option to go to the bar for a drink first or be immediately seated. I had made my reservation with Gem who was the hostess that seated us and I thanked her for helping me find a reservation time and date that for both my mom's and my schedule. Tyler was our waiter and he was attentive and knew just wanted to suggest for my mom. There was a live band playing and I asked one of the staff who they were  Dominica (  i apologize if I misspelled) relayed  the artist was  AJ Degrassi from California. He covered all genres  of song  while still allowing table conversation to happen without having to raise our voices. I hope there will be weekly live music. The atmosphere is upscale but thembience is relaxed. They have local craft beers available. I had OMB's Hornet's Nest. My mom had their Red Dragon cocktail- definitely recommend. I don't know if it was because it was preview night or not but at Eddie V's there is no skimping on portion sizes. We started with gulf shrimp cocktails and calamari. The calamari could've been an entree itself. It had a Asian glaze sauce with Asian cabbage and carrot mixed in . There's also cashews so nut allergies be advised. Next were our entrees: Parmesan crusted sole with veggies and Bacon wrapped filet with Alaska King Crab and asparagus. I kid you not every bite was flavorful and cooked so well. Truffle Mac & Cheese: Definitely do it. Again the portion sizes are plenty so we asked Tyler to box up the remaining for tomorrow. We ended with a Banana Butter Cream Cake- decadent and sweet! Added bonus it comes with  a scoop butter pecan ice cream. My mom was trying to figure out the recipe to make at home. It was an awesome experience at Eddie V's. My mom and I plan to come back as a special treat every year. The price point is much higher than the average restaurant but the the experience is worth it from the welcoming hostesses, attentive staff,  delicious drinks, savory entrees and decadent deserts. I would definitely recommend Eddie V's Please be advised there are a lot of steps; there is low lighting to add to the ambience so watch your steps. Also the bathroom is downstairs. I'm not sure if there is another bathroom near the bar and the band stage .",

It was very flavorful and seasoned just right. I loved the and jus sauce that came with it. We shared the sides. They give you big portions of your entree and sides. I loved the corn and scalloped potatoes. Oh and the bread basket was oh so good and ask for melted butter. I definitely recommend this place. The ambiance is nice.",

    "text": "This was worth it!!! We went yesterday for a friend's birthday dinner.  When I made the reservation I added a comment that it was a birthday celebration and I wanted something special with the dessert.  We arrived and were escorted to the private dining area and the table was decorated for her birthday.  Black and gold decor circles were on the table and there was a birthday card. We were all surprised.  This was the start to a great evening.   Shane our server was the best!  He obliged our initial picture taking (we wanted to get it over with before the meal started).  He even recommended a picture backdrop and snapped the shots.  The entire night he was attentive and made great cocktail and dinner recommendations.  We will be asking for him again.   Now to the good stuff.  The food.  Wow!  There wasn't one item we order that I didn't enjoy.  We started with cocktails.  I had the Patron Perfect margarita and my friends had Red Dragons.  We started the dining experience by sharing calamari and then two of us had bowls of the crab and corn chowder.  We all ordered the scallops for our entree and shared the half size orders of the truffle macaroni and cheese and sauteed spinach.  Simply delicious!  Dessert was the bananas foster and the Godiva chocolate cake with a cappuccino and regular coffee.  The entire dining experience was top notch.   My only critique would be that we couldn't hear the live jazz music that was playing upstairs. There was some music playing downstairs but I thought I was going to hear a live band.    But as you can see it still doesn't stop me from giving them 5 stars.",

    "text": "I'm sure there is a reason why everyone is giving this restaurant 5 stars and wish I had the same experience, but unfortunately that was not the case. We've been to this restaurant many times before in California and it's always been great - so naturally we were excited when it opened up right up the street from us. We usually have date night every Friday night and decided to go to Eddie V's a few Friday's ago. We called and the reservations were booked until 9:30. We said that was fine and we'd come in then. We walked to dinner and arrived at 9:40. We were seated within minutes. The vibe was awesome. So far so good. Then our waiter showed up about 15 mins later - which is quite some time to wait for a waiter for an initial greeting. He finally showed up and asked for our drinks orders, my bf put in a drink and I asked if I could sample one of the Roses prior to purchasing the bottle. He said sure and went missing for 15 mins. Then after flagging him down and reminding him, he came back with my boyfriends drink and my sample. I told him that I'd just do the glass. He said sure and he'd be right back. We sat around for about an additional 15 mins until I flagged him down AGAIN, and asked \"Can I get my wine?\", rather than saying \"Oh no, I am so sorry for the delay!\", he answered \"Sure\" in a monotone voice. He comes back about 10 mins later and my boyfriend and I could finally CHEERS! At this point his drink was warm... He said he'd be right back to take our order - once again, gone for 15 mins. We had to flag down a different waitress that was passing through who was super nice and took our order to relay to our waiter.   Then the food came out - 30 mins later. Calamari was over cooked. Salad was ok. Au gratin potatoes were good. Steak was good. Fish was good.   Overall, the food was ok - something we'd come back for and try different items on the menu. However, the service was the worst we've both experienced EVER and we dine out quite often - all over the world. The server never once expressed an apology, just a \"Can I get you another drink? I promise it wont take 30 mins this time.\" And blamed it on the bar guy - saying they were very backed up. Which if that was the case, and the bar guy really was that backed up, to pour a simple glass of wine, come back and check in on us, don't leave us hanging for 20 mins at a time.   Very very very disappointed.",

I ordered the shrimp with crab and it was $34 for 5 pieces of shrimp covered with probably a cup of breadcrumbs. Not worth the money at all. The shrimp tasted very chewy as if it was frozen for a long time or cooked and then reused. We also ordered the calamari and it was so chewy I had to spit it out. The rest of my 6 person party felt similarly about their meals. Very pricey for low quality seafood. Felt very disappointed as we were looking forward to a good seafood dinner.",

    "text": "Oysters were fresh, service was extremely friendly (but slow to deliver bar items), vegetarian options were not plentiful, and the seating is expansive.  There are few things I would like to share about our experience at Eddie V's Prime Seafood.  First, we arrived on the 4th of July and were quickly seated by a very professional staff of hostesses and waitstaff.  The menu was explained to our satisfaction and our drink selections were placed accordingly.  We waited an extraordinarily long time for our beverages and even received bread for the table before we had our drinks.  When we questioned the waitress, she said they were on their way.  The bartender then walked over with our sodas, but not the glass of wine that we also ordered.  After a little while longer, we asked the waitress again where our wine was and the bartender walked it over and apologized for the delay and took the glass off our check.  They were not busy, so I am not sure what the hold up was other than the bartender walking drinks out to tables herself.  That's a bit of an odd setup, and perhaps why the drinks were taking so long.  She should not be delivering drinks personally, that is what the waitstaff are for.  Second, our food arrived and we could not have asked for a better spread of food.  It was fresh tasting, piping hot, and served with a smile.  Lastly, the restaurant was kept very clean.  The occasional loud outburst from the kitchen staff made it seem like they were playing around and lacked the professional courtesy that the waitstaff were demonstrating was a bit confusing.  We even heard a manager shush them in an attempt to get the crew back in line.  Overall it was a 4 star experience and I consider myself a hard one to please.  I will certainly be back and hope to see that modifications are made to get beverages out to the tables in a more timely manner.  5 stars for the waitstaff who are very professional!",

It took awhile to even be acknowledged and then after placing our order took 45 minutes for someone to even acknowledge we hadn't received anything.

Drinks were okay. Bartenders attitude ruined the night for us. Won't be back, not worth the money.",

After a 10 minute wait?  We were seated downstairs in a back room?  The table did have a heart made of rose petals which was lovely!  And a card which was a very special touch.    Our server was very nice but did not have knowledge about the types of vodka they served? Hmm.  Our oysters were delicious, although 2 had shells in them.  Next up was table side made steak tartare.  Our sweet waiter mashed the heck out of it so much that it was tough when we ate it.  Had to ask for a clean knife ---shouldn't have to. Next up was a delicious lobster bisque but it had this weird mushy cake at the bottom that even the waiter said people hate it.  Finally the entrees---a dry swordfish and a way salty sea bass.  The sea bass was cooked to perfection but hard to eat because it was swimming in an overly reduced salt bath.  Our waiter did give us a dessert to go for our anniversary which was thoughtful.    We also did notice a waiter reset a table and double check the glasses with a flashlight.  That was nice.    Honestly I wanted to love this place and was so excited to come!  Sad it fell short in so many ways.  If I even go back I'll stay at the bar.",

    "text": "This place has been open for about 3 months, I decided to try it out for Queen's Fest. The ambience is very nice and upscale with beautiful decor and I love that they have live jazz daily, very nice touch! However it is every dark - I noticed 4 tables pull out their phone flashlights to read the menu. The service was a little on the slow slide, but being they're a new restaurant and it's their first time doing restaurant week that was understandable. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. I ordered from the queens feast menu, but I added an order of crab stuffed shrimp from the regular menu. I expected it to come out with my entree being I ordered it at the same time, when it didn't come with it I addressed the server who said it'd be coming right up. She then came back and said another server picked it up so they're making me a new one on the house. I honestly think she just forgot to put the order in. Luckily it was free because I don't think it was worthy of $18... I don't know if it was because they were trying to get it out fast but it was more shrimp with crab on top of it and not \"stuffed\" as I was expecting. Other than that the food was outstanding! I'd definitely go back & highly recommend.",

Everything from the food to service was top notch, and a beautiful presentation.Started out with Caesar salad which was by far the best Caesar salad I've ever had! Then a steak for my husband which was perfectly cooked and Swordfish for me. The only thing the fish was cooked with was olive oil and lemon but that's all it needed. I could not give a better review on the drinks and deserts though. I had the bananas foster cake oh my god best thing I have ever had!! And husband got the sorbet which was equally amazing! If you like old fashioned you MUST get this bar none best drink! The glass is infused with smoke and they bring it out on a plank board and make it in front of you. Beautiful place, impeccable food, definitely a great addition to the charlotte food scene!!",

My friend had the ribeye, which was also cooked perfectly. Actually the best or at least one of the best steaks I have ever tasted. When I came to the table there was a birthday card and confetti on the table for me, which was such a cute surprise. They also gave me a complimentary dessert for my birthday! Get the banana foster cake if you get a chance, the flambe it right at the table and it comes with a scoop of homemade butter pecan ice cream amazingness!

CG has always treated us well on special occasions and we had the same expectations for Eddie V's. The restaurant facilities are great, incredibly visual experience. There is live jazz in the bar area, but as we were seated in the back of the dining area we were disappointed you could not hear the performers.   Service was professional, but definitely not prompt (slow).  We both ordered filets \"medium\" temperature. Mine arrived medium well, over cooked. My wife's was so rare it was all but raw. We never send anything back but we did for my wife's filet. Eddie V's brought a new filet out, again rare, however not as raw as it was previously. We gave up on them getting it correct. We did receive a \"free\" dessert, implied due to the difficulty of the meal. However, in past experiences at Capital Grille, we received that for booking a special occasion with them.   Bottom line, same expensive prices as corporate cousin Capital Grille, but worse service and food preparation. I regretted we selected it for our tenth anniversary and likely will not return.   Our experience may be unique, I will speak positively to the setting it is visually a cool place to eat in, but the value is not there.",

The truffle Mac and cheese is to die for and I'm so happy to finally be able to enjoy real cocktail shrimp! The seafood tower is impressive and filling and the filet mignon is perfectly cooked. I am an absolute fan of this place!",

The decor and ambiance inside are great and make you feel like you are in an upscale environment. Service has been amazing each time I've visited and we have been well taken care of. They also have some light live band music playing which adds a nice touch.   You can't go wrong with many of the food or drink items here. Everything that I've had was delish. Of course the steaks are great and topped with king crab, even better! I also really loved the bananas foster dessert and the presentation was wonderful for it. The crab cakes are also amazing. I'll be here often on those special occasions!",

    "text": "My first experience at Eddie V's I came into it with super high expectations. Some area were met and exceeded, some not so much . Overall, I enjoyed it for the first time and may be interested in coming back outside of restaurant week.  The restaurant offers complimentary valet parking which is great in Uptown. I didn't get to use it this time because there was a medical emergency outside of the restaurant and I opted for street parking which was less than .1 mile away. No big deal.  I wasn't really greeted as I walked in but I understand as the staff were dealing with the incident that occurred causing the EMT truck to block the right side of the street. We did have to wait a few minutes past 7:30 for our table (party or 7). We were then escorted to a private room which was unexpected and highly appreciated! The ambiance was great including soft playing music, a huge tv which we turned to the NE and KS game and access to set the room's temperature which was a bonus for me because I hate eating dinner and being cold!   Our server , LA, AMAZING! He was super personable and relatable. He really made the experience what is was for me! He was knowledgeable and highly experienced in his field.  I was a little disappointed that I couldn't try the crab chowder because it had bacon in it but for the ladies who wanted to try it they couldn't because they were sold out. That was a bummer and they also ran out of the truffle Mac and cheese.   I ordered the Caesar salad as my 1st course and salmon as my entree. I wasn't wowed by the salmon. It was cooked well but I thought it lacked favor. I tried the fried rice with crab and it was pretty tasty. I'm not a big dessert fan so the options weren't super appealing to me. I was hoping the fresh homemade cookies were chocolate chip but they weren't. My party seemed to really enjoy the Banana Foster and the presentation was cute with the fire ! It did not come with the butter pecan ice cream because I believe they ran out and were served vanilla ice cream instead.   Overall the service was good but I'm not 100% sold on the food for the price whether restaurant week or the normal menu. I'll try it again and see it my opinion changes. It was not a bad experience it just fell a little short than what I was expecting.",

I'm UBER excited to have Eddie V in the QC, I am a Eddie V regular back home in Chicago equip with my signature server and all.  I attended a private Yelp Elite event here a couple of weeks back and was so impressed with the staff, food & the space. I met with the sales manager at the event and informed her that I'd like to have my husband Birthday dinner at the restaurant for a party of 6-8 in the coming weeks. I made the reservation and the day before I got a call to confirm in which I informed them that I think I want to do dinner alone with my husband and not with the guest. They kindly updated my reservation and informed me that they were looking forward to see us. Well we arrived and as I learned the day of the private event regarding valet 1. it's complimentary 2. The staff is super friendly 3. it's so high tech where you get a text with your ticket number and you use the link to request you car and get notified when your car is in route and when it arrives.  We were welcomed when we walked in and taken to our lovely booth where a card with \"Happy Birthday Marlon\" was placed for my husband from the staff. Immediately thereafter champagne  was brought out, mind you I planned none of this then warm bread, butter & an app before we even went over the menu.  Our server Mark was amazing, he was attentive, thoughtful & informative. He made some and amazing suggestions which we went with and were so pleased.  Appetizers: - Kung Pao Calamari - Lobster Tacos  AMAZING I mean just perfect in size and flavor   Main course : 6oz Filet Oscar style King Crab with warm drained butter   Sides: Crab fried rice  Asparagus  Truffle Mac n cheese   Note: A good way to try multiple sides is to get a half order which is pretty big if you ask me.   They even brought out dessert for the Birthday Man :-)  Eddie V's has always been a hometown (Chicago) favorite and I'm so glad they are here in Charlotte now.",

When I saw the Charlotte Agenda article on restaurants soon to open locally, I was giddy with excitement. I vowed months ago, I would be here on opening night.  Actually, I made it in the day after, but it surpassed my expectations. Our server, Daniel (or David, sorry it was Cinco de Mayo, so I arrived with Patron margaritas flowing in my veins) was on point all evening. Patient, helpful, funny....I can't compliment him enough. We had mac & Cheese, lobster bisque (poured table side!), crab fried rice, lobster tacos, crab cakes, and dessert. The only item I would pass on was the crab cakes and that's only because I prefer it without the breading. But we ate every single bite, so if that doesn't bother you, Order away. The lobster bisque and crab fried rice will be something I will always order on subsequent trips.   The decor is perfect for the area. It's dark and swanky, but still well lit enough to see around. Any date you bring here will be impressed, I know I certainly was.",

I made a reservation for dinner and we arrived to the restaurant about 10 minutes ahead of time. The hostess told me our table wasn't ready but we could wait at the stand or sit at the bar until she was ready.   We ended up waiting 25 minutes past our reservation time because it turns out she gave our table away! We came back up to check on our table and she was like, \"Uhhhh, I don't have a table. Hold on.\" Jeez, professional service huh? The worst part was they acted like it was our fault and we never received an apology or comped drink or any acknowledgement of their fault.   Our server was extremely nice and she even apologized on their behalf. She had only been working there for two weeks at the time, so there wasn't much she could do, but I appreciated the apology nonetheless.   We started with the beef tartare, which she mixed table-side. It was fresh and perfectly seasoned.   We then split a ribeye medium rare, king crab legs, and a couple sides, including the lobster mac and cheese and asparagus.   The steak was perfectly cooked as were the crab legs. The sides were okay, but nothing really stood out.   We did get the chocolate cake and ice cream to go (we were only around the corner, so it didn't have time to melt). Definitely get this, it was sooo good!  I doubt I'll return, but time will tell.",

The place is spacious and elegant, our waiter \"Pax\" was attentive and knowledgeable and made us feel really special the whole night.   We went with the idea of getting a tower of seafood (they have two options) but the whole menu looked so good that we decided to pick a little from each section instead. Drinks, my fiance got an old fashioned and I got a delicious Gatsby Sour. We got the half dozen Summer Love Oysters, the cocktail sauce was my favorite to go with these but the vinegar based one was a close second! We got a 22oz. USDA Prime Rib-eye. So tender, buttery and perfectly cooked. We also got Jumbo Lump crab cake.   Tartare Of Pacific Ahi Tuna was our favorite!! What stood out is the mango and citrus that was paired with it. Made it so light and refreshing.   Another favorite was the truffle Mac and cheese! We have tried our fair share of truffle things and this one takes the cake!   If you can't already tell, I'm in love with this place! They insisted that we ordered dessert and I'm so thankful we did we did the banana foster cake and it came out with this cool IG worthy flame syrup to pour on top. The dessert was delicious and it even said \"Happy Anniversary\" on it.",

My husband recommended a place that had a good margarita cocktail and as we were running in the cold, Eddie V's seemed very appealing.

Don't hesitate to come here! Very swanky dim lit interior and there was a live band playing cool late 70s to 80s music.  It is on the more expensive side but trust me worth it for a treat. Your taste buds will thank you. The quality is phenomenal!",

    "text": "OK, I'm going down the rabbit trail, but Eddie V missed the mark during Restaurant Week.  The place is gorgeous, hip, and everything one expects at a high dollar place.  So what went wrong?  The menu.  Entrees were teeny-tiny and poorly plated.  My $35 swordfish disappeared on the gargantuan white plate presented to me.  The monochromatic look was highlighted by four pencil-thin, overcooked spears of asparagus.  The fish was thin (1/2\"), and helplessly overcooked, too.   So disappointing.  My friends ordered the salmon (overcooked), and a filet which weighed in about 4 oz.  That's an appetizer, not an entree.  When it came to dessert three options were offered:  panna cotta, bananas foster (yummy), and mixed fruit.  Both the women in our party said, \"What?  No chocolate?\"  Such a simple fix.  I get that Restaurant Week is about lowered prices and packed houses; however, it's also about introducing yourself with your best foot forward.  Attn Eddie V:  you missed it, at least for our party of diners.  I know you can do better since your sister restaurant, Capital Grill nails it everytime, everyday.  Not ready to say, \"Give 'em a whirl.\"",

They offer parking validation if you park in the Bank of America  parking garage. The address for the location if you put in your GPS does not take you to the restaurant. Upon entering I was greeted I had a reservation. I was told everyone in my party had to be present to be seated. The hostess was nice, but some random lady who worked there named Jade made an appearance and was rude. She interjected in the communication and was not polite. She informed me what I was going to do. There was a staff talking to a manager at the front of the restaurant about a problem with a co worker. I was like what am I walking into?! I ended up being seated without all my party being present because they used the Address posted and walked the wrong way. They arrived 15 minutes later. I had the organic salad as an appetizer. It was a nice start. I had the filet minion and potato's as my entree. The potato's were made from scratch. I had the banana foster for dessert. The drinks were good. It was a lovely meal. The restrooms were clean. I liked the decor. I will return to check out their bar scene. They had a jazz ensemble playing and hope the issues at the front were just a bad day thing,",

I'm also hoping they consider opening for lunch.  It was pretty busy after work so I placed my order for the crab fried rice and lobster bisque soup.  They have valet parking if you're not able to get street parking.  There was a short wait when I got there as other folk were picking up orders and waiting to be seated.  It's a very swanky restaurant with a huge following as everyone seemed to know that the food was good.  I will certainly return for dinner at some point but the crab fried rice was good...too much egg for me so I'll know to omit it the next time...and the lobster bisque was amazing.",

    "text": "So I've now been here twice, I try not to do a review after a mediocre experience which the first one was. And that mostly had to do with the lack of knowledge my server had and the food wasn't anything special that visit. Now this past visit during Restaurant week, was great minus the fact we had a reservation and we all were there 15mins earlier and even though she informed us our table was ready we couldn't be seated until the exact time and then they still sat us 5 minutes late.  Once seated our server Natalie greeted us with a big smile and let us know that she can answer any questions we may have or find the answer if she doesn't know. Which I was very happy to hear since my last server didn't even try. Natalie was on it all night, very friendly and attentive.  I started with the Caesar which was okay but the few that ordered the crab & corn chowder just about licked the bowl so I'll be trying that next time. The Filet Mignon with truffle mashed potatoes was delicious and cooked perfectly. Last but not least the Banana Foster Butter Cake for dessert, I was already full so I didn't think I would eat it but when I say I ate every last bite because it was so good. If I come back for nothing else I'll make sure when I have a sweet tooth I come get that!",

    "text": "I visited Eddies this past Saturday and OH MY GAWD!!! Everything was great!! Very beautiful restaurant and a great ambience.  We started with a jumbo crab cake (s/o to other yelpers cause I chose this dish based off reading reviews) and it was EVERYTHNG!! We also got rockafella oysters they were okay.  To drink I order a Red Dragon which is one of their signature drinks and it was good. It's a play on a mojito so if you don't like muddled fruit don't get this.  We had the ice berg blt salad (one is big enough to split) i'm personally not a fan of wedge salad or blue cheese but my guy enjoyed his portion.  For our entrees I ordered the scallops, they were good and so filling, did not have that too fishy taste that scallops usually have so that's a plus for me.  My guy order the steam sea bass, such a large portion and it taste great, the sauce that it rest in is so good. He also enjoyed using his chop sticks to eat it.  Being that it was our first time here we wanted to try everything so we also got an indulgent, the stuff jumbo shrimp. Trust me just go ahead and add it to your order, you'll only be disappointed that your too full to eat anymore. I also order the lobster mashed potatoes, I was too full to finish so had them for breakfast the next day and they were good.  For dessert we had the banana's fosters with vanilla ice cream and when I tell you I've been dreaming about it since Saturday. One bite and all your worries are removed. It's just that good.  The best thing about our experience though was our server, Justin and his serving assistant (I didn't catch her name). Just was so helpful in giving suggestions and recommendations to us newbies. Even though he was busy he made sure that not only us but all his tables were taken care of. He also made arrangements for us to move upstairs to a bar table to hear the band once we finished eating. Justin was so nice and professional and he's nice eye candy #KEEPHIM!!  My only complaint is they do not have apple Ciroc at the bar and my Long Beach ice tea didn't quite taste right none then less my first experience at Eddie V's was great and I will be back.",

Listen.... this place is SUPER expensive but the quality is amazing. My only complaint is the price of the shrimp cocktail for only FOUR SHRIMP!!!  The sea bass is absolutely insanely DELICIOUS.  The truffle mac & cheese was perfect and had more than enough chunky lobster!  The filet Oscar was definitely worth even penny.  Get ready to spend easily $250 for dinner. It's worth it once in a while.",

Happy Hour the most, but I have to say, I was there yesterday for Easter brunch (along with my visiting daughter and a few lady friends) and we could not be more pleased!  First, our server, Jahniece White, was the sweetest, most accommodating waitress I have ever encountered. She was very attentive, but not overcrowding. She was knowledgable of the menu and her description of our food and drinks was on point.  Now, the food...  I've had several off the items on the brunch menu in the past and decided to try something different (Lobster Quiche Florentine). I was a little skeptical at first, as most quiche I have tried tend to be a bit dry. Boy was I in for a surprise! This quiche was a light and heavenly delight, wrapped in a crispy, buttery pastry (Hallelujah!). My daughter had the shrimp and grits, which was a creamy and flavorful dish. One of my friends \"nameless\" had the steak dish, but I didn't get a pic of it, as she went in too fast and furious before I could snap the camera. Actually, we all attacked our dishes pretty shamelessly! Dessert came out and took it to another. A few of us had the panna cotta, while others enjoyed the design of bananas foster and we shared the sorbet, uhm, uhm, uhm... (can I get some more napkins, please)  We stayed well past the Brunch hour, but the staff was very polite and did not try to rush us out. When we noticed the dinner crowd being seated, we decided it was time to take our full bellies and roll each other to the car.    What a wonderful experience. I knew this would be a great location, as it was created in my name sake EV's, which could be short for Evelyn's #1 Uptown Charlotte dining location.  Thank you for such a beautiful meal!",

Me being the yelper that i am i couldn't wait to take pictures in front of the crystal curtains with the fish statue leading downstairs to one of the dinning areas where we were seated. I must mention they offer complimentary valet parking which is a plus especially when it comes to downtown with the parking prices.  The waiter and waitresses were dressed nice in a white jacket and black tie, with black slacks they were presented quite nicely. On to talk about the menu and food. I ordered the giant crab cake which the waiter told me it was no need to order anything else because it was very filling and indeed it was. Drink of my choice was the 24 karat gold, what a name right? Nice touch with adding the gold sparkling salt around the rim. How can i forget about the relaxing smooth jazz music playing when we arrived and i believe at 6pm thats when the live jazz player comes in and plays his saxophone. For anyone looking for a nice date night with a great ambiance and aesthetics Eddie V's is the place to be!",

The staff at Eddie V's was attentive to every guest and so accommodating. No glasses were left empty and plates were always promptly cleared.  This used to be a building for Bank of America and the rooms for private events used to be vaults. There is a really cool sophisticsted ambiance throughout the entire place, but these rooms were the best. I highly recommend you visit them for your own private party.  Appetizers and drinks were all delicious. It has a great location right on Tryon uptown with a valet for parking.",

They all mingles and crack jokes like we're almost friend. Very entertaining. Here's what I ordered  The lobster bisque. 3/5 it's ok, it's creamy but tomatoes tasting and very little trace of lobster. The presentation are because and exciting but that's the end of that?  The Oscar style filet with king crabs: 3/5 The cream sauce was too salty therefore threw the whole filet off.. I couldn't finish it. The king crab is also ok but again it's he sauce..   After I got home from the restaurant. I was sooo sick.. Tummy hurting and all.. so I don't know what it is..  all and all. The amount of money I paid was a lot. The experience was awesome due to the food presentation and the staffs making it memorable. But I wasn't happy to pay for a $55 steak and be sick.. may think twice about going back..",

The food was just ok to me, besides the crab cakes which are to die for. Lots and lots of crab. We ordered a good amount of food. I am a foodie and so is my husband. We had the lobster tacos (good), lamb lollipops (sooooo good) and ordered scallops, stuffed jumbo shrimp and chicken with mushrooms for main course. The seafood here is definitely the best thing on menu. The sides are just ok. We ordered the truffle Mac and cheese, lobster mash, scalloped potatoes and crab rice. The atmosphere is so beautiful. I would recommend going during happy hour and taking advantage of those prices because to pay regular price for the food is not worth it. FYI we also waited a terrible long time for apps so the manager comped those which was nice.",

Let's just say, you'll want to enjoy the company your with.  Ambiance was fabulous. And our server Culton was really great!!             --  I really do want to love this place!!   --  Bread- good, but watch your teeth or the roof of your mouth. The outside was so hard my teeth did a double take.  Beverages: Gin a soda- Hendrick, soda, lime, cucumber- excellent!!  Salad: Amazing heirloom tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, cheese, & basil. Unfortunately mine had the stems still in it.  Dinner: Scallops- my friend said perfectly cooked. Increadible and loved the pairing with the citrus.  Sides: Mac n cheese plain with no lobster- It was a very sharp cheddar. More than what my taste likes. Not necessarily bad.  Yucky mashed potatoes. I got them plain. They came with scallions, dry, and not hot.. hardly warm  Potatoes a gratin- OMG so delicious!! The real reason to come back. I loved them!!!  Dessert: Peach cobbler- more like an over sweet pie.  Vanilla ice-cream - I loved it  Butter pecan ice-cream- my friend liked it, I did not",

    "text": "Our first time at Eddie V's Seafood. We live in Uptown so had wanted to try it for some time. They valet park as well as validate parking if you use the BofA parking deck on college. My wife loves seafood, it was Mother's Day and we read reviews on what they were known for and set our food selections based on recommendations we had read about. In the end we selected Eddie's based on a particular selection they have called The Big Eddie, a shellfish dish consisting of King Crab Legs, Maine Lobsters, Ahi Tuna Poke, Shrimp, and Oysters - dish is for two. We had a dinner reservation for 7pm and were there on time. We were told it would be 10 minutes or so before our table would be ready, no worries we went to the bar for a drink to kill the time! The interior is beautiful, they did a really nice job on the high end look of the place. I ordered the Smoked Old Fashioned, a recommendation. Shortly we were seated, having our drink selections transferred to our table. The waiter came by and we gave him the order since we already knew what we wanted. He informed us they were out of  The Big Eddie, the lobster specifically. Well given that was why we came, that ruined the experience that a high end Seafood restaurant was out of one of they classic dishes, and the lobster! I ended up getting a 12 oz steak and my wife already very very disappointed got the scallops and a side of crab legs. We also got the crab fried rice which was recommended. While we waited we had bread delivered to the table. We waited for a while for the bread plates but they never arrived. Finally a friendly guy came by and asked if we needed anything and he quickly brought the plates but by that time we were already eating the bread. When our order arrived, they served me the steak I had ordered with a side of crab legs and my wife got a plate of scallops! See picture, half of her order was on my plate. We later ordered dessert. Don't get me wrong the food was good, my steak was cooked just right, my wife's scallops and crab legs (which were already cut in half to ease getting to the meat) were excellent also. But the experience for a high end pricey restaurant was far from feeling high quality from the customer standpoint, in fact from our view it was disappointing to say the least. The staff (waiter) specifically knew the experience did not sit well with us, so he asked us to give them a second chance in the future. Not sure what to think, but I expect more from a high end place like this, good food but the high end experience was far from what customers should expect.",

In Tampa I had the crab cake as an appetizer and it was ah-amazing. However,  the one in Charlotte, didn't quite match up. I could've done without the panko on top.  Now to the good stuff. Their crab and corn chowder is so so delicious, full of crab and very hearty.  I usually get the Jumbo Gulf Shrimp that is stuffed with crab. My husband usually gets some type of steak or red meat.  The shrimp is delicious. I must say though, eat it with the sauce it comes with (I usually order extra)..definitely takes the dish to the next level :)  My husband has had the bacon wrapped filet topped w/king crab and the rib eye. Which he said he enjoyed both.  We also get the crab fried rice as a side. Tastes like your typical fried rice, just with a lot if added limp crab meat. Pretty good.  I will admit for 2 ppl, it's super easy to spend $200+ here (especially if you're ordering drinks). So definitely a special occasion place, not quite an every Friday place. Will we be back? Absolutely.",

We started our meal with a dozen oysters from the west coast. Let. Me. Tell. You. They were the best oysters I've had hands down. Their sauce made from champagne I believe was sooooo good. Our entrees included the lobster pot, bone in ribeye, lobster mashed potatoes, and asparagus. Everything was very good but the lobster mashed potatoes were the most memorable.

I ordered the pomegranate mule which was made with Tito's vodka. It was really tasty and served in a steel mule cup.   My husband and I shared an order of the calamari. It was cooked perfectly. Crispy and not oily. It was a massive portion.  I ordered the scallops and my husband ordered the chilean seabass. Both were delicious. The portion size was huge. We split a side of the brussel sprouts - again, very tasty.  Jazz music played in the background and it was just a really wonderful NYE dinner!

Where I live we celebrate NEGRONI WEEK and the best part about that week is every bar participates, they get creative and some of the proceeds go to help local animal shelters. So you get to have amazing craft cocktail while helping puppies and kittens. So I was excited to have one here.   We stepped into Eddie Vs and I loved the vibe immediately. It was a bustling after work happy hour scene along with people who came to dine. The bar was nice and no one waited for a cocktail or a refill as all the bartenders helped each other.   Welp!!! There was no Negroni to be had but our Bar God Patrick suggested the Jasmine as he was out of sweet red Vermouth. The Jasmine ended up tasting like the Negroni's cute little sister. It was super yummy.   Let's chat about those noms noms they were offering. The tuna tartar was so fresh and the sliced grapefruit added the perfect acid to the tartar. The shasimi was delicious and the sauce that they had it in was so good I could've licked the plate. The Calamari was really good as well.   I can't wait to go back.....",

    "text": "Full disclosure, I'm the current Duke of the Capital Grille and I might just have to make an effort to become the Duke of Eddie V's, it was that damn good!  Went on a Thursday evening for a Christmas gathering of friends and co workers.  Party of 6, made reservations and everything was set.  Showed up and the valet has this text message thing which was a great touch...no tickets and you can hit a button and request your car.  Love it!!  Was introduced to our server, Pax.  He has been there a few months but came from Del Friscos' so he knows what hes doing.  I was there with 2 wine experts, but Pax being a Sommelier as well as a bad ass server was on point and kept up with the wine knowledge.    Started off with a few oysters a piece which were nice, fresh and well done with the accompaniments.  We had appetizers next and the tuna tartare with the pepper jelly was simply amazing.  Everything was served at the peak of freshness.  I got to try the calamari which was \"asian style\" with nuts and lots of noodles.  Different, but well done.  Sweetie had the shrimp cocktail which she enjoyed.  Now, to the main event.  I ordered the bone in NY Strip, medium rare.  I didn't opt for the fancy sauces or added lobster tails just the way God intended it...meat.  This dam steak was the definition of perfection.  I'm typically a Ribeye guy but my co worker talked me into the strip.  It was cooked a perfect medium rare, not a second over on the grill.  Seasoning was amazing and the piece of meat was juicy, plump and was 100% satisfying.  I can't say enough about how great this eating experience was.  The ambiance of Eddie V's was wonderful.  I think this was a Bank of America Lobby and the poor servers had to walk up and down a long flight of stairs to the kitchen but they were all hustling and very attentive.  Great Job Eddie whoever you are!  I'll hope to see you soon!",

The amazing live Jazz made the ambiance unforgettable. My wife and I visited with a large group incl celebration of a few birthdays and I have to admit I'm a bit jealous that it wasn't my birthday! The wait staff was prompt and prestine, very knowledgeable of the menu and made amazing recommendations.   We probably ordered a third of the items on the extensive menu and EVERYTHING was delicious. Even the fresh and hot bread that came to the table was top notch.   Can't wait to make a trip back to this spot.",

    "text": "What a huge disappointment. We wanted to have a nice dinner while visiting Charlotte, and boy did we pick the WRONG place. At first they tried to sit us downstairs in an enclosed room. After letting them know, we did not like the feeling of being confined, we felt the attitude completely change by the hostess. \"Follow me\" is all she said and took us up to the main floor. I apologized but it was ignored. It felt like major attitude from the hostess area, hidden behind a nice atmosphere.   The food was OK. Biggest disappointment was the filet. I ordered the bernaise on the side because restaurants tend to overdo it. The bacon was burnt on the edges and falling off. I don't even understand the point of the bacon. On the non-burnt parts, the bacon was chewy and wet. The filet itself was tasteless. And the crab on top was not tender at all. It was more stringy than anything.   The oysters were unremarkable. The shrimp was stuffed with more bread crumbs than anything. The goat cheese mushroom salad was uncomfortable to eat. I felt I shouldn't have to cut that salad, but I did and I had to add a bit of salt!  Overall, we left feeling horrible about just dropping $200 on a nice meal that was definitely not the experience we had in the past elsewhere and hoped for. :(",

    "text": "* * * UPDATE As of Tuesday, August 13, 2019  Owner - DARDEN GROUP (Florida) Spoke w/Falon Farrell VP of Operations   Eddie V's Prime Seafood; Charlotte NC This incident happened on Thursday, July 25.   Bryce Harman is still employed with Eddie V's  He's Managing Partner. We were told by Falon Ferrell they are still investigating the incident.    First, we were told an independent investigation would be done, that didn't happen, the investigation was conducted by two staff members from their HR department.   Secondly, Falon stated 20 African American employees were interviewed and NO ONE stated that he was a racist. Why only question African Americans, why not white employees as well. That is a form of racism, (Racial PROFILING) when you only target one race of people. Does he only work with African Americans? Corporate doing this is problematic in itself!   Thirdly, Falon, stated the company has ZERO tolerance for racism. So why is Bryce still employed?  Why wasn't this matter handled by an independent group? When he has admitted  that he made the statement to us. \"YOU PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE EATING HERE IF IT WASN'T RESTAURANT WEEK.\"  Finally, She stated at this point Bryce Harman will be attending \"Sensitivity training classes,\" How do you come to a conclusion before the investigation is completed?  \"WE ARE NOT SATISFIED\"  Bryce said to my husband and I \"YOU people wouldn't be eating here if it wasn't restaurant week...\" Racial overtone...and  bad customer service...TIME FOR CHANGE...SOME THINGS haven't changed! We are conservative in nature but this HERE is a reminder to us all! U think stuff like this won't happen to you...YOU maybe NEXT!",

We made a reservation for 12 and we we're pleased to find when we arrived that we would be placed in a private room - which also had a TV. We had two main servers who were great, and could easily walk us through the menu. We all started with a few bottles of wine (they have a nice extensive list and will let you try any prior to ordering if you would like) along with the calamari, tuna & beef tar tar. Personally I thought the calamari was the best of the selection-it was served over a bed of crispy noodles and veggies with a spicy asian sauce on it. Also the portion size was huge and would be a great option if you came here for Happy Hour!   For my meal I got the jumbo shrimp stuffed with crab. They were a little crispy, but had great flavor and the shrimp were huge. A few other coworkers got the sea bass and filet and said it was amazing! We also shared a variety of sides, including the truffle mac and brussels, but the crab fried rice was the best of all! I would hands down go back to Eddie V's and order the Calamari and Crab fried rice at the bar + order some drinks.   And last, but not least you gotta get the banana fosters dessert. They light it on fire and it tastes pretty darn good!  Overall we had a great time at Eddie V's and our client thought it was the BEST meal they had in Charlotte - and we've taken them to nearly all the restaurants in Uptown.  The only downside is that it's a little pricey, but they do run a special during Restaurant Week if you want to try it out!   If you're looking to plan a nice private party, you gotta check out Eddie V's and ask for the private room!",

Service extremely professional and helpful but with an air of friendliness.  They went out of their way in the details to provide for our experience of celebrating an anniversary.   The mozzarella/tomato salad very fresh- at first disappointed by size but flavor made up for it.  Wedge had a bit too much dressing on husband's.  Husband got bacon wrapped filet- perfectly prepared and I had the jumbo shrimp that perhaps slightly over cooked but still tasty.  I would NOT recommend Brussels sprouts here- missing a flavor profile.  I actually took home- chiffonaded them and added some acid and seasoning for another meal.   We will return.",

Manager came to check on us and asked if we were there for date night or special occasion. They brought out an awesome, complimentary dessert and wrote happy birthday on dish. A really nice extra touch. I had the caprese salad to start. So much flavor! The cheese wasn't mozzarella but was even better. Worth getting for sure. But the star was my husband's crab & corn chowder. It was so good, seriously so dang good, I would go back just for that haha. Drinks were quite tasty and reasonably priced. Fresh fruit muddled and quality ingredients. We both had filets and they were cooked perfectly. Had Brussels sprouts and au gratin potatoes. Potatoes were not our favorite but that didn't mean we didn't enjoy them. Easily could have gotten one side to share but we splurged! Had a wonderful evening and we look forward to going back!

I really can't thank Eddie V's enough for doing its due diligence to make this a True success!    First, we were given one of the private rooms downstairs.  This was a beautiful space, which allowed for conversations to happen with ease.  Our server, Corbin was on point!  He knew everything & took his time with us.  We were not just waited on, but cared for during the entire time.  Other staff helped with water & bread refills & no matter where we went, we were pleasantly greeted.  Now, the food. Just wow!  My scallops were divine!  Best I ever had!  Everyone enjoyed their dishes.  The shared portions were plenty for our group and with all the bread, they left feeling very satisfied.  It was an extremely great experience from beginning to end that our guests felt compelled to give me all the kudos!  So I wanted to give it right back to Eddie V's.",

Service was good, but a little slow. The manager came to the floor and apologized about the wait.

Customer service is phenomenal and the food was great. It is pricy, however you are paying for exceptional service. We had the Lobster Bisque, Crab Fried Rice, Truffled Macaroni and Cheese, Parmesan Sole, Jumbo Gulf Shrimp, and Red Snapper.  They were all great. My favorites were the Lobster Bisque, Jumbo Shrimp, and Mac 'n Cheese.",

I will start off by saying I didn't like that they didn't let those that made reservations that valet parking wouldn't be available Friday night at peak hours . It took us 40minutes to find parking , but they were very apologetic for the inconvenience.   We started off with the lobster tacos, I wasn't aware they weren't all corn tortillas , but I only have a gluten sensitivity not intolerance . After they knew I didnt eat gluten,  they catered all my following meals to be gluten friendly.  The lobster tacos were delicious! We would go back and order these times 3 lol.   Our second course , we ordered the ceasar and BLT salads . Well prepared and DELICIOUS! Housemade , flavorful dressings, farm to table tomatoes on the salads, and a large portion . I honestly was full after the appetizer and second course .   Our entrees were , an 8oz and 12oz filet mignon, one with blue cheese fondue, and both with crab stuffed grilled  shrimp.   We ordered the small bacon brussel sprouts and truffle mac and cheese (not pictured) as sides. The steaks were cooked perfectly, and the grilled shrimp were a nice indulgence to pair with the filet .   As a complimentary birthday dessert he had a cast iron apple pie with a scoop of vanilla bean icecream drizzled with caramel . It was a large amount of food and leftovers were plentiful and reheated nicely the next day .  The next time we visit I will request to sit near the bar area, there was good , upbeat music being played which I would've loved with our dinner , but no complaints with any of the service or food , 5 stars indeed.",

They also gave me a card from my the while Eddie V family. It was such a nice touch!   Our server was kind and knowledgeable. She really added a level of greatness to the evening. I started with the Gatsby Sour. It definitely packs a punch. If you like your drinks strong, this is the one for you.   For dinner I opted for the crab cake and the filet. I shared my sides with the table, we ordered the spinach and Parmesan, brussels and bacon and potatoes.   The crab cake was cooked perfectly. It was packed with crab meat. I would absolutely order it again. The filet was also very tender and delicious. It was cooked to perfection and seasoned so well. I recommend ordering both entrees. You will not regret it.   My favorite sides were the potatoes and brussels and bacon. I mean how could you ever go wrong with potatoes and any dish with bacon. I don' recommend the spinach. It's missing something and the pieces of parmsean laid on top don't add to the dish.   For dessert I had the banana foster and it's totally worth saving room for it!   Thank you Eddie V's for making my birthday so special and for having some damn good food! I can't wait to come back.",

We had dinner here on NYE with a group of 10. The restaurant was packed, but the service was still superb. As we dined we listed to the beautiful live jazz music. We had cocktails, wine, apps, and entrees. We loved the jumbo lump crab cakes and my filet was cooked to perfection. The restaurant is beautiful and you are treated like royalty. The complimentary valet is a great perk as well.   My husband and I also had a 25 person wedding party here in one of their private rooms. We worked with Laura Green and she was phenomenal. We chose a customized menu for our event, signature cocktails,  a unique seating situation, etc. Laura was so helpful and attentive in these decisions. We also had a cake and flowers brought in for the event, and the Eddie V's staff ensured everything came together seamlessly. If you are looking to host a wedding party, birthday, corporate dinner, or any special occasion - Eddie V's is your spot!   We can't wait to visit again!!",

My ribeye was cooked to perfection and the Bananas Foster is one of the best desserts I've ever had.  But i want to commend the restaurant for its service this particular night. My son spilled a Shirley Temple at our table and that red grenadine leaves quite a mark on pristine white tablecloths. So a guy came by and said \"I'll be back with my team.\" 15 seconds later 5 people came to our table, the four of us got up and these employees switched out our tablecloth, napkins, glasses and silverware with a speed to match a top-notch F1 racing pit crew.  We then asked if the restaurant has crayons or something for our son to keep busy with. The manager came back with a Crayola box of 64 crayons and paper to draw on. She said \"we didn't have anything so I got these from the store down the street.\" THAT is SUPER service.  Thank you Eddie V's staff for making our night one to remember.",

We had a little confusion with the hostess not understanding our whole party was there so we had to wait for 10 minutes extra but no big deal! We got seated and ordered and the bread is delicious! I ordered the ceaser salad which was really good with homemade croutons and a tapenade. My husband got the crab and lobster bisque which was so good and had big chunks of crab and lobster!  We did wait a while for our bottle of wine to come. It came just as we finished our appetizers which was a little slow but everything else came out in a good amount of time.  I ordered the Norwegian Salmon which was really flavorful and cooked perfectly. The spinach side was okay but nothing amazing. Everyone who got filet said it was cooked perfectly (from rare to medium) and so tender. For dessert we ordered the panna cotta and bananas foster. Both were delicious!  Food portions were a little on the small side if you were paying full price but for restaurant week it was perfect.",

    "text": "This was my first time visiting Eddie V's and I've heard so many greats things about them so of course when my friend was having a birthday gathering I was looking forward to trying their food. It's the best seafood you'll ever try they said, It's like eating at a Michelin Star Restaurant they said, it's the best experience they said. Well here is my take:  My friend's party had 18-19 guests in total so of course I was looking for more than one waiter or at least the best they had. Our waitress was extremely nice  but like most places they have several tables so unfortunately the service suffered a little. Me and my fiancee and another couple ordered 2 bottles of wine $80 each which she poured fine, we sipped and all things are great. We drank the glass pretty quickly  and because this is a \"high class\" establishment we waited for our waitress to pour another glass which took like 20 mins so we ended up grabbing our own bottle and refilled our glasses.   We eventually got to ordering appetizers which OMG the crab cakes & West Coast oysters were freaking amazing! The Calamari not so much, very greasy but the flavors were there just a disappointment because I love calamari like breathing air lol. There were a few appetizers ordered which I'm told were great but I can only speak to mine. After the transition from appetizers to entree orders the waitress put the menus on the floor which I thought was kind of weird and again I'm expecting 5. I've tried tons of 3-5 restaurants in NYC and sadly this I feel like took away from the experience. I'm paying $35-$50 for just an entree and $80 bottle of wine I expect and demand more.  I ordered the Stuffed Shrimp with Crab which the Shrimp was over cooked. The couple across from me and another guest also ordered this and each one was over cooked. I wanted to send it back but didn't want to wait nor complain at this point. My fiancee ordered the Chilean Seabass which had way way way to much teriyaki sauce which masked the taste of this beautiful fish. The Seabass was cooked to perfection, light, fluffy and just treated with the upmost of care so my hat off to the chef. We ordered a side of asparagus which didn't come out with the ordered but our waitress quickly rectified once she came back maybe 10 mins later.  Overall this just an ok visit and maybe it's because the group was to big for our waitress but why make a reservation if Eddie's isn't going to put the best person on the reservation or at least 2 waiters. We didn't have any issues with billing but I did hear valet parking was a pain. We're regulars uptown for football so we parked in our normal free parking literally 2 mins from Eddie's. I'll definitely comeback for the oysters and Seabass. Not the 5 I was expecting but I did enjoy some of the food.",

Although we didn't request a private room, we had one AND we had a tv with an awesome server! If you ever go, see if you can get LA.   While I loved the vibe of the restaurant, I was a little disappointed with the food. Granted, the items I ordered were from the restaurant week menu so they may not have been up to par. I ordered the salad, salmon with veggies and banana foster butter cake. I love salmon, veggies and butter cake! But I didn't love them here. Nothing was bad, per session, but I have had better. The one thing that was delicious was the crab fried rice. I wish I would have ordered that!   I'd definitely go again because I loved the service and there were some other things I wanted to try but won't be trying what I had again.",

My girlfriend had to remind the server about her wine so  he ran and got it. We ended up having to tell another server to take orders because our server disappeared for quite a while she was very nice. Our calamari  app came out and The flavor of the calamari was good maybe a little overcooked and I feel like it could use some of that sauce that comes with calamari at other restaurants otherwise no complaints. my Salad came out that was also good and then the entree came out.  we have been at the restaurant for about an hour and 20 minutes at this point into dinner when the entree came out.  My overall experience was not satisfying after spending $125 I would say that I won't recommend this to anybody if someone asked",

Food was delicious !!! My friend got the salmon which I felt was a good portion ; it was also very delicious. I had the scallops which were equally great . I was nervous about getting the scallops because at a previous restaurant I had a total of 3 scallops with my meal . The video I am uploading shows the size of the scallops . Two cons : my sever seemed not to knowledgeable about the wine and also never tried to up sell my table . My friend and I both worked in the service industry years ago so small details we noticed . We would have loved a desert but the server never mentioned anything ; instead he just brought the check .  I honestly felt the poor guy was nervous . The place is brand new so we were very understanding. I am so happy this is here in Charlotte ! We really needed and deserved this !!!",

    "text": "What a meal!! My wife and I are spending a few days in Charlotte and stumbled upon Eddie V's. We are certainly glad we did! The professionalism of the staff was superb. The food was delicious and packed full of flavor and finesse. We started off with beautifully crafted cocktails, both delicious. Then had the shrimp cocktail with house-made dipping sauces. Be careful on the horseradish as it is amazingly powerful. Loved it though. My wife ordered the swordfish and throughly enjoyed it. I ordered the Parmesan Sole and couldn't be any happier with my choice. The roasted Brussel sprouts with shallots and bacon were a perfect addition to both meals. We finished with the Black berry cobbler with vanilla bean ice creme. Simply put, if you are wanting a fantastic meal with great service and attention to detail, Eddie V's will certainly deliver. Did I mention there was a live jazz band to accompany our meal?? Also, Marc was an exceptional waiter. I Would highly recommend him and this restaurant.",

As an offshoot of The Capital Grill, I expected more than the Valet to tell me that if I wasn't done by midnight, I would have to walk to the B of A garage and pay an extra $22 for parking.  The wait staff wears very nice, butler style jackets, but they seemed inexperienced and not well trained.  The bar service was sub par as well.  Our bartender was not familiar with the menu and seemed timid and reluctant to engage as good bartenders do.  I hope this helps and I hope they get it together because I would like to add Eddie V's to my list of places to go.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed. We came here for my wives birthday and were expecting a great meal. The waitress was very attentive and everyone was really nice. That was the positive. They were pushing South African Lobster tails which sounded perfect for a special meal. The waitress even said she would never go back to Maine Lobster after that. With that endorsement I needed to try it. Price wasn't a factor considering it was a Birthday meal, but that was the worst lobster I've ever had. The person who served it out it on the table and then poured a ton of this butter sauce on it. Thanks for asking us first. If you have to drown your lobster in butter then it probably isn't good lobster. We got the 2 tail special for $90 and ate a half of one tail. It was chewy and dry even with that sauce. We also ordered King Crab Legs, but they never made it to the table. Probably dodged a bullet on that one. We ordered the sole for the kids which was okay, but nothing special. Same with the calamari appetizer, I've had much better for cheaper. I really enjoy seafood and was looking forward to trying Eddie V's, but after not enjoying the food and then getting a $250 bill, I will never go back. There a much better options in Charlotte even for seafood.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Eddie V's Chicago so I was thrilled we were getting one here. EV Chicago's service is as top notch as it gets. The atmosphere is warm- almost like a speakeasy it's so dark & classic. We saved our first visit for a birthday celebration. Sadly, I'm extremely disappointed in the Charlotte location. Breaks my heart. We won't be back.   Quick summary for short attention spans: Good food, weird decor & atmosphere, dreadful service management.   The pros: The food was good. The s'mores dessert might be one of the best in town. Steak & tuna were cooked perfectly. ( Oddly- We were never offered cracked pepper with our salad or entrees despite it being offered at other tables. Our server couldn't be bothered, I guess. )  The cons: The atmosphere is very out of sync with the restaurant and brand. The lighted nightclub details at the entrance and glitter curtains are disorienting. It's a high end joint but the artwork is from early 2000 era TJ Max. All weird choices for such a great restaurant. I could get past the decor if it weren't for the service...  I would call the service terrible. Our servers were working as a pair with two large tables and us. We were clearly the lowest possible priority. We waited 10 minutes before we were greeted, another 10 for water, it was maybe a full thirty minutes before our drink & app order was taken. The entire time we waited a staff of 8, including a floor manager, were clearing tables around us. The manager could see we were just sitting there looking around for a server. The managers lack of action shows me it wasn't an off night and service would be similar any night. (By contrast, EV Chicago has so many people waiting on customers you almost have to tell them to back off.)   Our server clearly knew nothing past a few buzz words on wine and the menu. I'm not a food or wine snob but if you want me to spend $100+ on a bottle, you need know more than red with red meats. Right?  (At EV Chicago, the servers can speak to every bottle and really help you find what you should pair with your meal.)  All in all, Charlotte has enough unique and interesting high end spots for celebrations and special nights out. I would skip Eddie V's and go somewhere more authentic with genuine service. However, if you are ever in Chicago- go!",

It was the end of Restaurant Week, so they were very busy, even so we were seated within just a few minutes of our reservation time.  The ambience of the restaurant is exactly what you'd hope, the decor was sleek and beautiful and the wait staff was very pleasant and efficient.  Once seated, we quickly we had birthday cards on the table from the Eddie V's team, what a special touch!  My  husband and I shared a crab cake app and a bottle of champagne to start our night off.  Our server was very attentive to fill our glasses as needed!  The crab cake was flavorful and cooked perfectly.  For our next course my husband ordered the lobster bisque  and I had the cesar salad.   The soup and salad came out in just the right amount of time, not too quickly but not too long that we were there just waiting.  Both were delicious.  For our entrees we ordered the Stuffed Jumbo Shrimp and the Scallops and decided to share sides of spinach and brussel sprouts.  The portions were perfect!  The dishes all tasted as lovely as they looked!  Best Scallops I have ever had!  Our server was so sweet, when we finished our entrees she brought us special desserts for out birthdays.  At this point we were so full, but there is always a little room for dessert!  We will be back to Eddie V's!",

My mom is a food critic because she cooks from scratch alot! My mom had the ribeye and after her 1st bite she said, \"it's delicious!\" My daughter loved her kids meal of 4 colossal grilled shrimp & fries!! We had the crab cake as an app & it was very meaty!! My Sea Bass was excellent with the perfect spice of fresh ginger & a light soy sauce with spinach. The lobster mashed potatoes with asparagus and hollandaise sauce was AMAZING!! Yolanda was our waitress & she was very patient, explained everything we asked about, attentive & personable. She didn't rush you to make a decision & that's superb service. Also, Yolanda asked in the very beginning, \"do we have any time constraints?\" I was blown away & my mom was extremely impressed with this considerate question! Oh!! The Banana Foster is amazing",

The manager is practically a sommelier! I've had Chilean sea bass all over the world and this was by far the best I ever had. I think the soy ginger sauce did it and it was such a beautiful piece of fish to begin with! Also the Parmesan sole rocked!  Oysters Rockefeller were a bit disappointing: they don't put PERNOD in theirs which to me exemplifies a True OYSTERS ROCK. That one drop per oyster really makes a difference.  Great location too as it was next to our hotel which was the Omni. Walking across the street was nice after dinner with the waterfall on the town square.",

Live music also played in the bar area, it sounded great.  We ordered a tuna appetizer, crab cake and swordfish.  My wife is still raving about the crab cake.  The Brussel sprouts were very good and fairly unique.  Just an overall classy place.  There are two levels of seating and some tables are definitely more desirable but all are very nice.

Well, Peter ands Sherry you'd better hope they don't open Eddie's for lunch or I might sneak over. It's equidistant from my office. Made a reservation on Open Table. Things started out poorly. The ladies at the front desk redefined disorganization. Yes I had a reservation, they were running on time, but I should sit down for a drink at the bar. Grabbed a table IN THE BAR. Waiter came up with some bread. When we said we were just waiting for a table and would just like a drink, he dropped that bread like we said we had a bomb. Told us he would have someone help us. (Obviously below his pay grade) No one ever came. He was standing over to the side so he wasn't swamped, just not his job. It was by then past reservation time (remember they are running on time) so I walked over to the hostesses. You could see the \"Uh oh I forgot\" on their faces. We weren't in a hurry so I said ok. One hostess said she was going to bring us champagne. Never got any champagne. About 10 minutes later a guy came up and asked if we wanted a drink. Of course hostess came right then and said our table was ready. Really confusing frustrating start.  There is a Thai place in Vegas that has long waiting times. They have a system, take your number and message you on your cell when the table is ready. You can wander around while you wait. You have 10 minutes to get back from wherever you are when the text you. If they did that at Eddie's you could walk up to the Capital Grille where the front desk and bar are organized like Amazon Prime, have a drink and wait for your summons to Eddie's for a table. It's only a block away!  Things went straight up hill from there. Our waiter, I want to say Arron, was as smooth as they come. We had drinks, a little wine, salads and entrees. Service was impeccable, timing was right on and attention was just right, never intrusive. Our waiter was charming.  Goat cheese and arugula salad was the best EVER. Heirloom tomatoes looked good but my sister doesn't share. One rule was no meat as we were having beef on Christmas. My son had the sole, I had shrimp, my sister tuna. All were outstanding. Crab fried rice came out perfectly hot and without a shell, so someone at Eddies's is reading these reviews. Desserts looked outstanding but we were too full to try. Surprising, the check wasn't so terrible all things considered. A little help at the front desk and bar (maybe a lot) of help and open for lunch, this place would be pretty close to perfect. Just hold your temper until you get to your table.",

My sea bass was good, but nothing to rave about and lacked flavor. The presentation was neat though.   My husband's filet was good, but once again nothing to get excited about and we have both had much better filets with more flavor in Charlotte.   The brussel sprouts were awful. They were more steamed and not much flavor to them. We were expecting more of a roasted flavorful dish, but they tasted like steam in a bag, texture and all.  It's a beautiful spot, but wouldn't not be a top choice again when we are looking for a meal at this price point.",

    "text": "I love this steak house. Disclosure: I am a Ruth Chris gal..loyal and devoted Ruth Chris frequenter...but Eddie V's!! I haven't been back to Ruth's since Eddie's came to charlotte a few months ago. The ambience is impeccable. The steaks are delightful. The bone in ribeye is huge, juicy, and tender. But the star of the show for me is the Oscar filet wrapped in bacon! Freaking amazing. Also the drinks are delish. The hope diamond is my fav. The moet and vueve clicquot flight are delish. The deserts are delightful; flourless chocolate cake and Banana foster yum! All in all one of the best dining experiences I have had in Charlotte.",

    "text": "This place is top notch.  The decor alone is worth coming for.  This place looks like they just hosted the royal wedding.  Four of us can for a birthday at 7:30 on a Sunday, and the place was maybe 30% full.   The crab cake was fantastic.  The Caesar flavor was really good, and the presentation was fantastic.  I had the halibut, which was cooked perfectly, and tasted good, but I didn't think the sauce was up to par.  A little watery and chili didn't seemed to have been cooked long enough.  The hardest part to write about this review is the service.  Either our waitress was having a rough evening, or she just doesn't have a lot of personality.  She made a couple errors that weren't a big deal, but because of the dullness they seemed to be more annoying.  At this price and level of restaurant, the service is usually a lot higher of a level.    I'd definitely come back again.",
