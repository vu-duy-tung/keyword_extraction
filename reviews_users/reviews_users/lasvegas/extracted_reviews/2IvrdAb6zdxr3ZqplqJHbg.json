    "text": "We've had way better, but what the hell could you possibly expect from a freakin' airport Mexican restaurant?! It gets ridiculously packed, so don't plan on bringing your family of 12. Most tables seat around 4, and the pre-flight, pre-gamers, pack it in. It's your typical Chili's-style restaurant, complete with all of the run-of-the-mill tacos, nachos, and easy-to-pleasy Tex-Mex apps and entrees eager (or hesitant) travelers are looking for. Prices are high as hell, so steer clear if you're on a budget. Grab a $10 Corona or Margarita, $15 nachos, and say a prayer to Jesus Cristo for a safe, quick, and easy flight home (and that this crap wasn't you're last meal!). Honestly, come on, it's an airport Tequileria! Oh, service is typically terribly overwhelmed and, concerning our last visit, sucked juevos grandes.",

    "text": "Stopped on our way to the gate as a margarita looked appealing. However, we should've trusted our instinct and left upon entering.  The manager was standing at the back of the restaurant telling people the section was closed only after they were seated.  She could have just as easily tied the area off with the available section ties.   After sitting down the waiter was constantly rude and impolite.  After bringing waters he asked what we wanted to order and before we could begin he started walking away from the table.  It took 2x to get him our drink and food orders.  Subsequent requests for more water were blatantly ignored.  The margarita which arrived about 15 minutes in was somewhat decent but over priced (there were no drink prices on any of the menus and most food lacked prices as well).  When our food came our stomachs turned at a stale, cardboard, food gone bad smell.  We choked down two of the blue corn chicken quesadillas to much dismay.  The guacamole was bland and flavorless. The chips were stale. The only decent item on our plate was the pico de gallo.  We tried to stop the waiter 3 times to tell him the food was horrible. Twice he replied ok and did nothing but walk by our table.  The third time we finally had his attention we told him the meal was horrible and he asked if we wanted anything else quite belligerently to which we said no.  He offered no resolution then disappeared for 15 more minutes. He did not once offer to discount our meal or offer a solution.     Upon returning to our table I clearly stated that I would not be paying for the food which he begrudgingly accepted, scoffed. ran our receipt and returned it to our table as if we had inconvenienced him.  As we left we received angry glares from the rest of the staff and heard him complain to another customer about our table.  My stomach hurt and my wife became physically ill about half hour after eating.  When we returned to get a copy of the receipt we asked them to check their chicken and they didn't seem to care.   My recommendation as a consumer is to avoid this place at all costs. A week old, refrigerated, wrapped sandwich from 7Eleven would provide more satisfaction than anything this restaurant has to offer.  To the Jose Cuervo corporate folk I would recommend retraining your employees, closing the store completely, or rehiring friendly people who know the meaning of service.  This place definitely leaves a bad taste in the back of your throat and tarnishes the Jose Cuervo brand.",

It is a far walk from Terminal B so get ready to get your exercise on. The service was pretty good. Our waitress was very nice and efficient. It was about an hour before closing time and she did tell us when they were closing but wasn't pushy about it. We ordered the Baja Shrimp Tacos and the Southwest Chicken Chopped Salad. Both were pretty good. Could've also been because we were starving from traveling all day...this was our stopover destination. If you have time, I definitely recommend sitting down and ordering food versus buying a sandwich from one of the convenience stores...those sandwiches were dry and flavorless.

    "text": "People bitch way too much in general, and specifically about air-travel.   Flights are late, TSA carry-on rules are a pain and some overworked and underpaid airline employees make no secret of their unhappiness. But none of that makes it less amazing that for a historically small amount of money you can be whisked to any location in the country (the world, for that matter), reliably, in complete safety (as of 9-29-07 US commercial aviation is batting one fatal accident in about 4.5 million departures) and at least relative comfort.   There are a number of problems with bitching, but the biggest is that it leads to blindness. We overlook or dismiss lots of good things, big and small. Jose Cuervo Taquileria at McCarran Airport (Concourse C) in Las Vegas probably gets overlooked and dismissed a lot. And I think that's a shame. I've been there twice, and was impressed both times, though in very different ways  First time I was making a connection (something in common between an airport and Yelp?), the place was full but my friend and I scored a table. The first thing the waitress said to us: 'kitchen is backed up. It could be 45 minutes to get your orders out. Is that OK?' It wasn't (couldn't wait), so we left. But I was impressed. That was someone who had her thinking cap on, was willing to be honest and by so doing saved everyone a lot of grief and aggravation.  My second experience was more conventional, but equally customer-centric. For around $13 plus tip I got a generous sized and good (on a par with what I'd expect walking into a random San Francisco Tequileria) chicken  fajita burrito plate and large bottle of ice tea served by the the very friendly and efficient  Rachel. Chips and rice were fresh, beans were good, the fajita itself was well prepared. When I asked for Nutrasweet Rachel ran to Starbucks to acquire some.   But more than the food, the tea, the Nutrasweet, the service,  I  got a small island of comfort and private space. The experience didn't change my life, but it made the trip more pleasant, and was well worth the price. I'll be back.   Food: Three Stars Service: Five Stars Total Experience: Four Stars Other problem with bitching: it's bad for you.

So the chip basket comes with like 4 or 5 mini cups of pico de giao stacked on top...again she runs off before I can question her. Finally I'm able to ask for salsa. \"We don't have salsa, just pico.\" Why didn't you say that when I ordered it! \"I figured most people know.\" this is an airport bar, do you really have regulars?!

The nachos were plain tasting and there was not enough cheese on the nachos either. The bud light was refreshing at the least. The flavored margaritas were watered down so I would recommend not to get that. The a/c was probably not working well since we were sitting there sweating. 2/5",

I grabbed the other one... Grease stains. Maybe chorizo. Let's try the next table over... Definitely salsa on this one.  As I'm sitting there squinting at other tables trying to spot a new-looking menu, a female server whooshes over to my table with a scowl and snatches one of the grimy menus and returns it to the table that I took it from. No welcome, no hello... Just a hit and run menu snatching.  Luckily she was not my server; I don't think that we would have gotten along.  My server turned out to be Maggie, who was prompt and friendly.  Thanks to her my day got started with about 4 glasses of coffee and a smile.    No help from the food though, or the prices. I got the huevos, scrambled, with chorizo, home fries, and tortillas. The plate lacked any sort of garnish (cheese?  Sour cream? Pico de gallo?) and the side of salsa I asked for was 3 bucks. 3 bucks for a couple spoonfuls of salsa!!?  Good thing I didn't know about that charge til I got my bill, or I might have had a salsa free breakfast. The 'home fries' reminded me of the chewy cubes of frozen potatoes you used to get in middle school cafeteria with your French Toast sticks and oj with a peel back aluminum lid.    3 bucks for a side of salsa??!?  You kidding me?!    You'd be better off getting a Naked Juice protein shake from the Hudson's News store and coming here for booze if you feel so inclined.",

The shrimp tacos came on two soft blue tortillas each and exceeded my expectations.  The main course was accompanied by a generous serving of black beans and a small serving of chips and salsa.

I'm actually still here.  Glass of wine for $12 and it's decent. I got the chicken enchiladas for $13.  They are really good. Just a little spice- not so hot that my nose runs.  Soft flour tortillas and a portion that's fitting.  3 enchilada, rice, beans.  I probably could have split this and maybe 1 more taco with someone but I'm alone. So I ate it all!!   I think this airport has such limited food.  I was happy to find this.  You can buy a hotdog and a soda down the way for maybe $10, but here I sit and I get to be tipsy sooooooo.....",

Hence, the following greeting may be deemed as inappropriate:  \"Excuse me sir, the tables are for patrons only.  Do you plan on ordering anything?\"  \"Yes, 75 year old smoker's cough raspy voiced bad makeup lady.  I will have a water while I wait for my colleague to arrive.\"  Then the oversized bookmark that is your menu, with 8 items to choose from.  At least making a choice of what to order wasn't too difficult.  Light lunch sounds good, so I choose the Southwest Chopped Chicken Salad.  a) The 3 pieces of dry chewy chicken breast were \"sliced\".  Not so much chopped. b) Plastic utensils?  Really?  You charge $11.99 for a crappy salad and can't afford to pay someone minimum wage to load silverware into an automatic dishwasher? c) When 2 people dressed in business attire are having what appears to be a fairly involved discussion, it's rude to interrupt with \"Can I bring you your check?\", even though the paper plates are visibly empty.  You have 30 open tables.  You don't need to turn them over that quickly.    I know I sound like I'm expecting a lot from an airport restaurant, but step up your game a little.  Next time I'll just get my 5 hour old slice of pizza from Sbarro and at least get a smile from the cashier.",

    "text": "What to do when you get to the airport WAY early AND your flight out of Vegas is delayed at least another thirty minutes?  Duh!  Drink, silly!  Since this was on my way OUT of Sin City instead of on my way IN, I was no naive sap:  Me: \"How much is the Mangorita?\" (drink prices are ODDLY not listed on the menu)  Waiter: \"One Mangorita.\"  Me: \"No.  How MUCH DOES IT COST?\"  Waiter: \"$12\"  Me:  \"That's what I thought.  I'll have a Mangorita, please.\"  Hey, you expected me NOT to get it?   Actually, for Vegas prices, this was quite reasonable (who would have imagined that food and drinks would be CHEAPER at the airport than in the city you're visiting?).  The Mangorita surprisingly tasted like REAL and FRESH mango instead of some artificial \"mango\" syrup.  It was blended and slightly sweet but not syrupy and served in a pint glass. Also, the waiter claimed it had a double shot of tequila and while I couldn't taste it, I sure as hell felt it.    Woo!  Drunk plane ride!  Yay!  I also ordered the chicken chimichanga.  As someone who used to fry chimis professionally in high school (yay crappy part time job!), I wanted to go back to the kitchen and give the cook a little tutorial.  The size was good, but it was undercooked on the outside (although nice and hot inside) so while the ends were crispy, the middle of the outside was kind of doughy (bleh).  I slathered on the generous portion of guacamole to hide the icky texture because, as mentioned above, the Mangorita was starting to take over my body.  It was filled with plenty of shredded chicken but also with shredded lettuce.  Um, WILTED shredded lettuce.  Bleh again.  The chips tasted like they came from a bag opened yesterday instead of being made on site. The salsa tasted like it may have been made last week by my mother who considers black pepper to be \"too spicy\" to add to her food. Triple bleh!  One last bit of super USEFUL info: this is ONLY a good option if you've got PLENTY of time before your flight.    Our meal took over an HOUR.  The waiter came over, took our drink order, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back, took our food order, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our drinks, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our water, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our food, said \"right away\" when I asked him to bring the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, brought the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back for the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with the receipt to sign.  I have no idea if he came back to pick up the signed receipt because we didn't wait around another 10 minutes.    I found this really weird for a restaurant in an airport. We were inside the \"secure area\" so it's not like we just stopped by for a nice lunch.  We had a plane to catch!",

I flagged one down but she gave me a dirty looked and walked the other way.  I tried to flag another and she just averted her eyes.  Finally someone came up and was rushing us along rudely.  Finally the food arrived, chips and salsa, 3 small tacos and a tortilla soup + 2 drinks... over $60.  Mind you I pay a lot of money for food sometimes, but this was horrible.  The Carne Asada tacos were dry. The seasoning was bad and the tortillas were dried up.  UGH...  My friend had the tortilla soup and she was very disappointed as well.  Bad service, bad food with expensive prices..:(",

    "text": "Jose Cuervo wins by default because it has a monopoly on the airport as being one of perhaps two non-fast food options. This is like being the smartest kid on the short bus - not much of an accomplishment, right?  Totally famished and spent after a few days of work, my co-worker and I were so happy to find an actual \"restaurant\" to sit and have a decent meal before our flights back to L.A. She was also looking forward to watching the Lakers game on one of their many TV's.  Well, I ordered the enchilada plate with black beans/rice and had a mango margarita to help me unwind. The food reminded me of the crap you would get at El Torito or one of those places, and it was so salty. Since I was so incredibly hungry, it did the job. The margarita was pretty good. The bill was steep, though - about $45 each (including tip) for a meal and like two margaritas.   Shoot, I spent less the last two days I was in town and I blew what I saved on food that blew.  My co-worker and practically everyone in the place was totally irate because they had a hockey game playing on all the screens about 30 minutes into the Laker's play-off game. The poor servers had to deal with everyone's harassment and could only reply by saying they didn't have access to change the channel and that they already paged the manager to change it. Let me tell you, I left for my flight about 45-60 minutes after this charade, and they still didn't get the channel changed.  Dear Jose:  You are located in Vegas, NOT Canada. No one gives a shit about hockey here. We're in the playoffs for f**ks sake! I'm not even a Laker fan and even I have the sense to know this is bulls**t!  Next time, invest in a REMOTE CONTROL - I'm sure your waiters/waitresses are competent enough to handle this sophisticated piece of hardware without your help!!  Smooches,  Joy B. on behalf of all of Laker fans stuck at the McCarran airport on 5/19/09.",

Chef definitely needs 3 life sentences for his cooking skills! I would definitely pardon line cooks! It's not their fault! They just chopping things! My friend had something that was suppose to be \"Caesar's salad\" but what it was, is dry salad mix from bag and they just popped the bag open and threw few rock solid croutons and Caesar dressing on it! Again, have chef arrested, save lives of many innocent travelers! Senor Jose Cuervo I hope your tequila is better than your Tequileria!",

The breakfast burrito, with a few customizations, is fabulous and I would likely come back for it regularly... If the prices were dropped a few bucks and this weren't in the airport.  Standard breakfast burrito with choice of bacon or chorizo is just over $10, which is absurd to begin with. Subbing carne asada adds on $2. But the best (and most expensive) thing you can add to your burrito is queso sauce... Except it's an insane $3 fee. So your deluxe delicious breakfast burrito, with a side of potatoes (because a duvet-sized tortilla simply isn't enough carbs for one meal) will set you back nearly $20 with tax and tip. Frankly, I can't justify or afford that, but if you can, by all means contact me to be your personal assistant.  Seriously though, the proportion of egg to bean to bacon in the regular burrito is perfect, the pico adds an awesome bit of freshness and acidity, and the queso makes it a next-level contender for one of the best I've had. But only a captive audience will pay that kind of price, and they damn sure won't be happy about the bill.",

After my experience, I would say don't be afraid to come in here, just don't have high expectations.  After sitting down (it's seat yourself) it took awhile for our waitress to come over and take our drink order. Once she did we ordered two waters, the chips and salsa and I got the barbacoa tacos done American style.  The food came out surprisingly fast so this food is not made to order. It was warm, but not hot.  The chips and salsa are huge. My mom and I realized we should have ordered one entree with the size of the appetizer!

Service was good but not necessarily great (I asked for no beans and got beans anyway).  It's a typical, busy airport restaurant.  The food was TERRIBLE.  But, again, comparatively speaking, airport food is never good.  I had the blue corn tacos; the tortillas were cold, the chicken looked weird, and the rice was also lukewarm.  The only good thing was the margarita, which was pricey ($16) but not bad.  On a positive note, the restaurant is big and a bit loud inside, so it totally drowns out the airport announcements.  A not terrible way to pass the time if you have time on your hands in Terminal C.  But don't go with any high hopes for the food.",

I asked the waitress for the virgin marg in a plastic cup with a lid, since it was going to be for a child. She stated that they don't have children's cups and that they didn't have to go cups with lids. She brought the children's drink in a glass container. Very soon after, the virgin marg was spilled. The waitress then replied, \"oh, do you want me to get you a plastic to go cup with that?\" I asked why we didn't get one in the first place, and she replied that she forgot. She then brought out our really subpar food, which none of us got to eat because we were busy cleaning up from her mess. She then brought the bill, which was $114! We asked her about it, and she replied that she comped our virgin marg. We replied that none of got to touch our meals because of this \"mistake\", and she shrugged her shoulders.   I don't feel like I am usually very critical of waitstaff- I have waited tables before, and I know how hectic it can be. But this was far and away some of the worst service I've received.",

Despite pretty bad service, we wrote on the check that we were leaving the tip in cash, but oops--hubby needed to break some bills, which I tried to tell the server. My husband was coming right back, but apparently the server went crazy, as he proceeded to go after me for money like a stalker, following me as I left for the terminal to watch the luggage. Server waited until my husband was out of sight, and then confronted me with a mini tantrum, saying, \"nothing?! I get nothing? Thanks. Thanks a LOT.\" And then he stormed off like a two year old.  The other passengers around saw the tantrum and looked at me like, \"who is the stalker boyfriend?\" It was really uncomfortable.  I went back and told the manager, but I remain dubious that anything will come of it.  Beware, lovely yelpers! Eat here at your own risk, or else tip generously in large quantities of anti-psychotic pharmaceuticals.",

I stopped here since it was outside of my gate and a margarita sounded good. The waitress recommended the Ultimate Margarita since it wasn't much more expensive than the house and you get more booze. I asked how much they were, and I should have braced myself. $14-something for a house and $16 for the Ultimate. Wow. But, I was set on a margarita at this point so I decided to shell out for the Ultimate. It was good! Well made and strong, but had a wonderful balance between the booze and other ingredients.   I also ordered some chips and guacamole. This was pricey as well at $10.99. The guacamole was great but the chips left something to be desired. They seemed like they were something you'd buy on the grocery store shelves. In the end though, they were just a vehicle for the guac!   Service was friendly and good, but they all did seem burnt out. I heard they were hopping all day.",

    "text": "Quick Summary: Granted it's an airport bar and flavors are going to be mediocre and things are going to be overpriced... but I think I would have preferred waiting in the 20 min Starbucks line over this... yeah I did just advertise for another place in this review... take that as a sign.  I'm all about expectations... you look at my reviews and for the most part, I like places. It's because I know why they exist and appreciate why they are there, whether it is for ambiance, for flavor, or for a quick bite.  For an airport bar, I expect quick service, food for the masses, and an up charge cause well they can. I put emphasis on the quick service though, cause let's face it I'm in an airport and I've got places to go.  That being said I came into here on a weekday morning, part of an hour an a half layover on my trip. Though it was a weekday morning, it is Vegas and much like the city, the airport never sleeps... as proven by the masses of people all over the gates and the dozen or so already in this joint.  It's a seat yourself sort of place, which is kind of nice... they should put all hands into attending to the customers. I grabbed a spot next to few other groups who seemed to be pretty well settled in (with drinks, etc.) And that was where I sat for 15 min with no other interaction.... and the waitress must have buzzed right by me 3x without so much as an acknowledgement that I was even there.  I finally got my drink order in for a bloody mary, which the waitress convinced me to go with their house version which included a chipotle spiced vodka and came with a double shot... or so she told me... after the 20 min it took to get my drink, it wasn't anything particular to rave about... and it surely wasn't a double shot either... I know what a double shot of vodka in the AM does to me... and if I left there upset... it didn't do it.  I placed an order of the chorizo nachos, which were ok... somewhat warm... cheese not as melty as I would expect... but then at this point... what did I really expect?  So as I started this review... it's all about expectations... and for an airport bar they couldn't even live up to that... I spent a good 65 minutes for a drink and chorizo nachos (which didn't come until 55 min had passed)... I shouldn't have to wait anywhere for that sort of slow service...",

I looked at Nathan's Hot Dogs, since I haven't had them in years. Two hot dogs and fries would run close to $14. I kept looking and found Tequileria. There were tables and chairs. I looked at the menu and saw the prices were quite reasonable for an airport.  I ordered the chimichanga platter expecting a small microwaved burrito type thing. What I received was one of the largest chimichangas I've ever gotten. Along with tri-colored chips, rice, black beans, salsa, and picante. I expected the cheese, sour cream, and guacamole chimichanga to be mostly empty but it was pack with pork carnitas. There was no air inside it at all.   The pork was tender and fell apart easily even using the plastic fork. It tasted good. If this was a frozen chimichanga that was just microwaved then I'd like to know who makes them and sells them.   My server, Sonya, was also very pleasant and attentive even while being really busy. I never saw her stand still unless she was talking to a customer.  Water and the chimichanga cost $11.88. That's slightly more than a Sam Adams at one of the bars. For a restaurant dining experience in an airport in Las Vegas, that's kind of hard to beat.",

Non are really \"that bad\" but you never really want to take your date in one. Most try hard, but none really tend to hit that 4th star. This review is more for the staff here at the Jose Cuervo Tequileria..but the food deserves honorable mention as well. I was here waiting for a flight home last week and my partner and I needed a sit down meal pretty badly. We found two of the few open seats here in the eatery and grabbed them... however on the way in we were spying a few seats in the \"outside\" area...only to hear the waitress comment to us that we \"shouldn't sit down and expect quick service\" as she \"couldn't handle the tables\" she \"already had\". Not a good omen...but we ventured forward grabbing a small table inside. Now yes...the place was packed, but the waitress that we had greeted us fairly quickly, indeed mentioning that she were very busy but she would get us some drinks and food as fast as possible. I also overheard a woman sitting at the table next to us complaining to several staff, and patrons that walked in...about the service, the manager etc..even instructing people walking by to \"please not eat here\".  The waitress that she spoke to also happened to be helping us....and I must say the waitress handled it well. Yes, out food and drinks took a bit longer than we perhaps should have...the food wasn't 5 star... but I gotta say the nachos we both had were exactly what was needed. And the beer was cold.",

Just a regular margarita (no Cadillac, no double) cost me $17. Go a few gates down to \"Sammy's\" you'll get better drinks for half the price. My biggest gripe with this place is the slow follow-up service. Both times I've had trouble getting the server to return to request my bill and cash out...busy not being a factor. They have these \"request bill/server\" buttons on the tables, but you'll have to use it several times before it's actually responded to. To sum it up, this place is really overpriced (even for an airport), the food is \"okay\" and the service is slow and underwhelming.",

If you're at the far end of Concourse C, you have few choices including Burger King, Nathans Famous and a few other fast food places. If you're actually looking for table service, Jose Cuervo's \"Tequileria\" is it.   What is a \"Tequileria\", exactly? Is it a place inside of an airport that serves very overpriced margaritas that are mostly mix and Taco Bell quality food? Must be so, because that's what you're getting here.  Seating is \"seat yourself\". In a \"Tequileria\" setting that means grab an open table, which will probably be dirty and watch the staff desperately try not to make eye contact with you for a good 10 minutes. Eventually (maybe), one of them will make a mistake, accidentally acknowledge you and as a punishment, have to take your order. You might be worried about missing your flight but no fear, your food will come out INSTANTLY. No, it's not tequila infused ninjas in the back preparing your dish at lightning speed, everything is premade and thrown on a plate.   My chicken tacos ($12) were literally indistinguishable from Taco Bell's Chicken Soft Tacos. Same cheap iceberg lettuce and \"shredded cheese\" toppings. Some Fire Sauce would have been appreciated because these mofos are bland. I'd say skip the food but honestly, there's really not much better in this concourse.  Two stars - one for being the only sit down place in C, the seconds because my dinner did not result in The Troubles on my 3.5 hour flight home.   Also, note to self - rent a space in the airport, buy a bunch of Taco Bell meal kits and call myself a \"tequileria\" = PROFIT.",

    "text": "Typical airport food and service.  The waitresses are nice but seem like they are just trying to keep up with the heavy load of people.  Food came out quickly.  I ordered the fish tacos  and a coke for $21.  The food was made up of two basic battered filets, corn or flour tortillas, a ton of Coleslaw with a strip of chipotle sauce on top.  Rice and retried beans come as sides. Margaritas start at $13 and go up from there.  On a bright note my server, Natika accidentally over charged me and I only caught it after I left.  Upon returning, she had already found and corrected the error and had a receipt waiting for me.   There is at least one bright and shinning star in LV and her name is Natika!  Way to go!!",

I got a mango frozen margarita and some nachos to which I added black beans, they charge extra for that, just FYI. The frozen margarita was okay. However, the folks next to me also ordered the mango margarita. They could not taste any tequila in their drink. They sent back their drink and got a new one. We realized the guy behind the bar preparing the frozen margaritas was just throwing things in the machine to make frozen drinks, hence the variability. Another glass came out with an awkward messy fill. At one point, we watched him drop a bunch of the limes, lemons and berries for the bar on the counter and then scoop them all up and put them back in the containers. It didn't look the most hygienic. I was not very impressed. Go get a pretzel at Auntie Anne's or Jamba Juice or something.",

I could se their buzzers light that they were wearing and yet again nothing.   After another couple minutes I pressed again and yet again same thing.   I am sorry but at this point I really had had enough. I got up and spoke quite harshly to the staff because the had just ignored a customer.

When we asked the waiter for a fresh set, he told us that \"there was no microwave\" and that it was fresh. He then went in the back, brought out another soggy, cold set, (with less toppings) and put it on our table. He showed us our old platter and said, \"see, they are the same.\" So basically, all of the nachos are cold, soggy, and probably sitting out in an unhygienic fashion. 2 margaritas and a plate of nachos for $43 not including tip.",

When the waitress asks you if you want some drinks, say yes because you are going to be waiting a while. The service is slow and harried, as this place is definitely a \"turn and burn\" restaurant, your seat will still be warm when you go to sit down. We ordered three taco salads, something that should be expedited, but even those took a little while.  The trick at McCarran if you want some real dining options is to take the shuttle to the baggage claim terminal and convince a TSA person to let you go across to the tram to the new Terminal 3 without having to go back through the checkpoint. That, however, can be time consuming. So if your time is limited, your options might be limited to this place if you want sit down service.",

Their chips aren't top ranking either, so I wouldn't recommend chips and salsa. The service was good.",

One also talked about the fact of choices in the airport & how this place probably doesn't give a rats ass about yelp reviews because they are set.  I've had a lot of good airport food in this country, it should be an absolute privilege to have a spot in a place with limited choices & numerous clientele.  C'mon Vegas, you're better than this!

On the other hand, maybe it's best I didn't, as I never would have eaten here, and honestly, my experience was not that bad.  During our layover, the closest place to our gate was this restaurant.  It really didn't even matter what the restaurant was, we would've eaten here anyway due to its proximity.  Luckily, it was Mexican food which I generally enjoy.  Started off with guacamole and chips.  Did not expect to receive the biggest dollop of guacamole I have ever been given by any restaurant ever in my life selling guacamole.  Holy cow.  It was creamy not chunky, which is fine.  Slightly over salted (according to my husband), but edible and filling.  We split the taquitos and the chicken tacos.  First of all the taquitos were very good.  Pretty decent portion too.  Very savory, nice flavor.  Satisfying in the way fried Mexican food can be satisfying.  As for the tacos, we got them on corn toritillas.  The plate came with three, and again, decent portion and very satisfying.  I liked my meal.  Did not leave feeling disappointed as far as the food goes.  It tasted pretty fresh, and looked pretty on the plate.  The service could use a tweak.  It took forever to be waited on, and then forever to receive the check.  But it was extremely packed in there, so perhaps that's the risk of dining in an airport restaurant.  I'm not sure what others were expecting when eating here.  I suppose we were just starving and ready to go home, so were easily pleased.  I dunno.  But our experience certainly wasn't awful or 1-2 star worthy.",

    "text": "If you want to spend 45 minutes waiting on a bowl of mediocre tortilla soup, come here. The 2 waitresses and 3 runners do a great job at killing your time.   Pretty much the worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant.  I wasn't expecting much from an airport dining establishment but this definitely hit well below my expectations. All I wanted was a bowl of soup!  We sat down at about 7:30 am waiting for our layover to NOLA. A waitress acknowledged us and said she'll be with us in a moment. 10 minutes later and we still haven't put in our order. Two other tables directly to our left were seated after us and a different waitress took both orders. I asked if I could place my order and she rudely told me to wait my turn for the other waitress.   I ordered my soup. Pretty mediocre. I could do without the sour taste and the pickled red onions.  Check was dropped off as i was finishing up what I could of the soup. Boyfriend put his card down, and the waiting game started again. Our waitress was nowhere to be found so we asked Miss Unfriendly from before if she could run the card. She pointed at the bar at our waitress who was running drinks and said \"you have to wait for her.\" So we waited another 5 minutes before we threw down exact change in cash and left as quickly as possible, though our waitress did make it in time to come over to our table and grab the check as we left this hell hole at 8:15.",

    "text": "I'm going to be nice to this place because it is a regular haunt for me when I fly SWA through LAS since it is central to most of the gates in their terminal. I have always grabbed a seat at the bar and I have always found the bartenders there to be very nice. I see a lot of complaints about the waiters and that may be True... just one more reason to put your butt in that bar stool by the taps.  Let's get one thing straight first, this is *airport* food so your expectations for quality should be lowered and prices should be raised... no matter what. I grabbed a Subway sandwich in an airport once. $8.99 for a turkey sub that is $5 down the road from my house. So, yes, you will spend $10 on a beer or wine and it will be as large as a $4 pour at home. I don't like it either, but it is what it is when you're traveling. Don't want to pay high prices for standard grub? Pack a bag lunch.  Food here is OK for standard mexican stuff. The guac comes as a side for some dishes and I think that's more worth it than ordering that straight up as an appetizer. I usually stay away from the fried dishes, so I have had quesadillas and tacos there without being disappointed once.  You can get your drinks to go and they sometimes open up the very end of the bar for to-go drinks only... nice to be able to just walk around people watching with a brew between flights to kill time if you ask me.",

It was a lively eatery that caught my eye so I decided to give it a go since my flight was delayed. I ordered the Blue Corn chicken Quesadilla. It was... unsatisfying... the portion was large but I just didn't get the flavor... I also found it a a little odd that if you wanted your order taken you had to flag down someone that worked there that was zipping by. To be fair it was really busy inside.  .::Overall::.  Blue corn Chicken Quesadilla - chicken was dry and didn't have much flavor... the guacamole was kinda bland as well...  .::Recommendation??::.  Maybe the other dishes in the place are better... IMO i would have probably been happier getting a Jr Whopper w/cheese at Burger King haha",

She suggested a cocktail upon her introduction, an expected upsell in an establishment like this.  When I requested water with no ice and lemon she showed no disappointment and had it on my table in less than a minute.  Before it was half empty, there was another waiting on the table for me.  I ordered a carnitas breakfast burrito, which came out very quickly and was certainly tasty!  The salsa served with the dish was very mild, but there's a bottle of Cholula on every table so heat may be added to taste.  The check came at the perfect time, when I was almost finished with my meal.  Even after paying my bill and leaving tip, Vikki came by asking if I'd like more water - a rarity in my experience.

Congratulations n tortillas were rolled and stacked together. Potatoes were cold. I returned Ned my plate and requested two eggs over medium with flour tortillas and bacon. My brother had I ordered the barbacoa too and he did not eat it. My niece ordered chicken enchiladas and did not like the sauce. I winded up eating the enchiladas and refrained beans. My eggs over medium were good. The waitress was very nice and did not charge us for the two barbacoa plates. My brother and niece winded up going to Burger King next door. The flour tortillas were better than the corn but still not of good quality. The barbacoa was more like Dried shredded beef. The potatoes were diced and fried but blah.",

    "text": "Ehhhh, look...  I walked in here ready to hate this place like many fellow Yelpers do.  It's not hard to do either!  When you walk in here, it's EASY to hate this place.  You know what it reminds me of?  That cantina in the Muppet Movie where Kermit and Fozzie got thrown out...  El Sleezo Cafe!  I had to google it!!  (I need a shirt with this business name on it!!)  I digress...  You walk in, and it's definitely a wretched hive of scum and villainy, but I feel like coming to the defense of this place for some reason.    It's loud and full of travelers and suitcases and people are LEAVING Las Vegas and hung over and cranky and none of this is necessarily the places fault.  I sat down and did notice how dirty everything felt and looked.  There were scraps of paper and receipts on the floor, the table surfaces were greasy and the menus were yucky.  I think that all can and should be fixed by spending a little on labor after hours for some deep cleaning.  Shame on you guys for not doing a better job there.  Because of all this I sat down expecting to be disappointed but with realistic expectations.    I seated myself and waited a short time before someone came to take an order.  I ordered.  The food came.  The staff was not especially friendly but not unfriendly either.  I'm not sure it could be much better with people dragging their suitcases around walking around confused.    My plate of food landed on the table and I wanted to hate it - well - because this is the El Sleazo Cafe right?    My fish tacos were good!  They were fresh, NOT fishy at all and well seasoned.  The beans and rice were good too.  I couldn't find a problem with any of it.    The bill came and I had a mixed reaction.  I only ordered two items, a beer in draft and TWO fish tacos and my total was $26.80 before tip.  That's pricey, but it's a Las Vegas airport diner.  Can I be mad?  I guess.  Kinda.    The other thing I noticed about the bill is that server Alba had written Thank You with a happy face in it.  It's al lay like a secret message that said, \"Send help!  I'm a hostage!\"  You know?  Like I think she's doing the best she can and she was perfectly kind to me and did a great job, it just looks like a busy, busy, tough crowd.    So, is it overpriced?  Yeah.  Is it a fantastic dining experience?  No.  was my food good?  Ya.  My beer was cold and yummy.    Maybe I'm getting soft, but I couldn't help but feel like the staff at the El Sleazo Cafe is doing the best hey can, and it's hard, and the food is pretty good, and it's a little expensive, but it's in an airport and it's really busy and considering all that I was pleased and the experience was good.  Thanks Alba and team.  Keep up the good work, I know it's hard in there!  (Google the El Sleazo Cafe and watch the YouTube clip you'll get a chuckle!).",

Took a seat at the bar, service was friendly, got a margarita which was just ok and then was informed that if I order a beer, I get a shot 1/2 off which I totally wanted to try.  Got a corona for however much and a shot of really nice tequila, Dobel, for $7.  This place is like any other airport establishment in that it isn't cheap but it's definitely better than gambling your money way.  At least you're getting something out of it.",

It was great that the bartender made us Micheladas and they were good ones.  The food was also decent. I liked the chips and the carnitas burrito.  This is a fine enough airport restaurant.",

It was nice to sit down for breakfast however, when we got there it was a little confusing since not one staff member greeted us. There is a self serve button on the table, but yet one server was walking around. Hence my confusion about what to do. Luckily, the server came to our table and took our order and the food cane out fast. My only issue was that the breakfast burrito was incrediably greasy. Like dripping down my wrists greasy, it was pretty gross. The homefries were over cooked/dry and flavorless. I would try this place again only because my husband said he liked the huevos rancheros. You could just tell the ingredients were not fresh. I understand it's early and in an airport but the quality of food should not suffer.",

Not particularly slow or anything like that, but I do expect some small degree of courtesy from a server. We were treated in a totally offhand manner, and the server got our order wrong.

My Husband ordered egg, potatoes, and bean plate and I  ordered the tortilla soup and two coffees for us.  Both meals were very disappointing my soup had very little avocado and barely any cheese.  My husband's plate had no kind of flavor and even the coffee was watered down.  So if ever in the Vegas airport go with the chain  resturants.  Like Burger King.",

After entering the Tequileria I passed by two employees who didn't even acknowledge my existence...So I helped myself to a menu.  I eyed up the breakfast burrito and noticed they would stop serving breakfast at 10:30. Even though it was literally 10:30 on the dot, I figured they would still accommodate my request.  Instead I stood at the bar for 5 minutes without even being asked if I needed help.  Finally the bartender comes over at 10:35 and says I'll be with you in a minute, then walks away.   By the time he comes back its even later.  I asked him if I could please get the breakfast burrito and he says no of course, so I plead with him to no avail.  Then he goes to me \"if you want to order food go around to the service window on the other side\".  Thanks for telling me this 5 minutes ago pal.  At least they could have been friendly considering I couldn't get the only thing I wanted on the menu.   Had they been nice in the slightest I might have over looked the fact that it smelt like Bourbon street the day after Mardi Gras.  Or that the nasty waitress gave me a dirty look when I asked about the breakfast burrito.  Or that I saw chicken bones on the floor when I knelt down to pick up the menu I dropped.  Gross!  No thanks. I turned around and walked out.  Please consider my review and the other numerous bad reviews before dining at this disgusting excuse for a restaurant.",

    "text": "Incidents of poor service are almost always simply an individual disgruntled employee, but I still believe they deserve to be called out.  During a long flight delay, a few buddies & I went for some (rather tasty) Margaritas at the Tequileria. As we were ordering, our server, who for the purposes of this review will be known simply as \"Mr. Chips\", informed us that the margaritas we were ordering had \"1800 premium tequila and Grand Mariner, because that's all we have\". Slightly confused, we ordered said $13 margaritas and then asked if we could have a side of chips & salsa. Mr. Chips' response: \"No, sorry, all we have on the menu are nachos, do you want nachos?\" When we told him that nachos were too much food and that we just wanted a little thing of chips he said \"sorry, can't do that, so you want the nachos?\" and we were forced to call after him (he immediately started walking away) and tell him specifically NOT to get us nachos. When pressed later about the chips (after we saw another customer get a little thing of chips & salsa with his meal), Mr. Chips said \"nope, this is a union job, can't break the rules\" and still refused to sell us some lousy chips & salsa.  We sat there incredulously drinking our margaritas until the ladies sitting next to us tried to do the exact same thing. We overheard them discussing how the nachos were too much and how they just wanted a small order of chips to go with their beer, and couldn't help but start laughing. They looked over at us shocked, and we explained how the same thing had happened to us! Turns out the chip stunt wasn't so funny to them, because it seems Mr. Chips had been berating them earlier for no apparent reason, calling their eye color ugly (brown like #&@#) and generally being antagonistic.  Unfortunately our flight left too soon for us to see the manager (\"they couldn't find her\") so we were unable to witness the denouement of the chips saga, but please please try and find somewhere in Terminal C to patronize that isn't the Tequileria!",

A second waitress approached us and then told us it it was open seating. Searched all over to find a table but could only find one that was literally piled upon with dirty dishes and money from a previous customer. We stood several minutes while one waitress circled around the table several times, and she finally stopped long enough to pick up the money and tell us that we could sit if we wanted but it would be a while before she could clean the table. We then watched her walk away and pick up menus and other items, leaving us to continue to stand there. So... We left and went next door to Burger King; not what we wanted but we were waited on and not treated rudely!",

They charged me 12.95 for the damned thing!  The bill said 'DB Margarita.' I asked the waitress what that meant and she said, it's a double.  We only serve doubles...! Well there may have been the scent of tequila, but thats all. Either way, 12.95 was about 5 bucks too much.   Rip Off! Also, she didn't want to serve us coffee. Seems they don't want people hanging around the restaurant waiting for flights. But it wasn't that busy... No coffee after dinner? She actually said we should get it in the terminal!",

    "text": "I go to Las Vegas now and then for actual work meetings. On those trips, you can find me quick in a crowd - I'm the only female in the vicinity wearing clothes that offer modest coverage, looking very, very sober and very, very pale.   As I result, I've become familiar with the Southwest terminal at McCarran, which is a pretty painful experience: crowded and loud, with poor people-traffic flow. And speaking of the other people, these thoughts often alternate in my head:   1) \"Why are all these parents bringing small children to Las Vegas?\"  2) \"Who invited all these tacky people to this airport?\"  Back to the children, I'm often attempting to look as unfriendly as possible on the Southwest flight so no one with kids sits next to me. It's a useless effort, but a fight worth fighting to the bitter end. I choose a seat far in the back and unleash a campaign of intimidation - irritated snobby expression, weird flipping through high-end fashion magazine, gum chewing ... and often pretend-sniffling and nose-blowing. In my head, I think \"this activity makes me look very unfriendly. I'm a materialistic rude person with a cold. You don't want your kids to sit next to me.\" The truth is, I'm a pushover who loves babies, just not loud babies in close proximity at 30,000 feet.   Unfortunately, this attack plan never works. People see a nicely dressed petite business woman and think \"she probably smells okay. I'll sit next to her and take her arm rest.\"  So these days, with the help of Tequileria, I bring in my last line of defense: booze. Ideally, after a quick trip to said Tequileria, you carry that telltale I've-had-a-cocktail scent as you squeeze into the boarding line. Parents would hopefully take note and not seat their kids next to the Drinking Lady. But then, if they still do, you're infused with 20 ounces of sixteen-dollar strawberry margarita and can't feel your soul. Surefire solution.   Can't say I've had the food. Don't really like the crowded tables or airport-style service that has you wondering if someone will come take your order. But this is my ardent message to business travelers at McCarran - hit this place up pre-flight, because LAS to OAK via Southwest appears to carry a five-screaming-toddler minimum.   Cheers to self-medication.",

    "text": "HOLA! Greeted as if you were in \"Mexico\" Jose Cuervo's Tequileria tries to make you feel 'at home'here at the end of the C Terminal of the Las Vegas, McCarran Airport near Gate C16.  Ironically (and with good reason since its Jose Cuervo's Restaurant), the tequila choices are limited to Jose Cuervo Tequilas...  They play some good Spanish language music to put you in the mood to drink excessively and the food is extra tasty (meaning salty) to help induce thirst. What more can you expect to get in an airport in Las Vegas, Nevada. I ordered an \"Asada\" burrito with \"steak\" and got shredded beef, lettuce, cheese and salsa wrapped up in a warm tortilla. It is clear that their interpretation of Spanish words is questionable, but in the end, I was hungry and it was tasty (meaning salty) and had I been on a weekend long drinking binge in Sin City, I would have needed a burrito of this caliber to get me back to reality. Truly the one thing that doesn't stay in Vagas are the ailments (or diseases) which you acquire there.    I ordered something simple, a beer, and was coerced into buying a 4 dollar Cuervo Silver Tequila Shot. I got the shot pretty quick, and began to sip on it... but the beer took about 20 minutes due to \"keg\" issues. Understandable, but I didn't get any \"we're sorry\" discount - Whatever, how often will I ever be here?  Overall, it's good if you have a two hour layover, in the Las Vegas McCarran Airport at Gate C16, but then, it's an airport and expecting an excellent restaurant with excellent service and selection is like asking for world peace: many will try, but it sure as hell will never happen. There is Wi-Fi available also if you want to catch up with your life while living your imaginary one in Vegas. And there is nothing more awesome than busting out your laptop and chatting with the world while enjoying a beer at the Las Vegas airport - I hear people really respect that.   Beer + a shot + Tax and Tip = $15, I guess they never stop robbing you in this town. Burrito was $7 and about the size of a glorified spring roll.",

I tried to \"make\" a salad for a vegetarian by modifying a few things but they don't have black beans so mostly I had cold ice berg lettuce, cold cold roasted corn and tomatoes that were frozen at some point so as to taste like cold water slush cubes. All their salsa but their spicy salsa tastes like water. They charged $2.49 for what amounted to 1.5 TBL of \"guacamole\" which tasted like smooched avocados with no flavor or texture.

Sat down and waited 10 minutes before I gave up on waiting and flagged a waitress. The waitress had no idea what was on the menu and told us that it was her first day. I have nothing against someone on the first day, but you might think there would be some training or something.  I ordered the enchilada plate, and my coworker just ordered a drink (she had eaten earlier). We told the staff this, but when my food came out they wouldn't give it to me. The server literally came out and said \"oh, there's two of you, I must have forgotten one\" then turned around and carried my food into the kitchen. 2-3 minutes later she came back out and said \"that's really weird, there is no record of another order\". I answered that just I had ordered food. She then set the plate in the middle of the table and said \"oh, well i guess you two are sharing\", then she brought back small plates.  Regarding the food, the first couple bites were okay, the beans were good. The rice was dried out (think heat lamp). Then I started tasting the \"taco mix\" seasoning that was certainly used in excess.   After I had finished, we sat and talked for 25 minutes. I kept looking at the server, expecting some eye contact and a head nod to provide the standard \"we are done\". She never got that message. That's fine, not everyone does, no sweat there. I finally looked right at her and said (she was within 3 feet) \"can we get the check?\". She literally stared at me for 10 seconds without acknowledging she heard me. She then turned around, poked at the computer for a couple seconds then walked away to the other side of the restaurant. A few minutes go by and she comes back to the wait station (this was right next to my table). About 6 of the staff were chatting there not doing anything (I get this happens from time to time, but most of them had been there for several minutes). I looked at my server again and asked for the check. She again stared at me for about 10 seconds (no acknowledgement again). She then went into the kitchen and came out a minute later with someone else who ended up running the check.  The True icing on the cake however, was that I felt sick before I got on the plane and ended up feeling sick for the entire flight.  Overall, just go to the Burger King next door. At least there you will know what you are getting.",

I ordered the chicken tacos as usual and what showed up looked completely different to what had become a favorite. The chicken was rubbery and yellow in appearance, The flavor was off and it came al la carte (no rice, beans & chips). I spoke to the manager who informed me that the menu had recently changed. Apparently, so have the taste buds of those responsible for this change. I will likely return but will not order what they refer to as chicken tacos again.",

None of us enjoy flying, so we stopped in to have a few drinks before the flight.  First off, the service was terrible.  We didn't even have a server greet us for 15 minutes.  Then it took her another 15 minutes to bring our drinks back.  After being there for a bit, we ordered food...which took about 45 minutes.  While eating, one of my friends asked for a water and the waitress came out with another beer for her instead of a water?!?  When we were done we asked for the bill, and the waitress disappeared for over 30 minutes and then when she came back we had to ask her for it again.  It was ridiculous.  Anyway...When the bill came I was shocked that my bill was $65.00 for just myself.  For 3 house margaritas (standard size) it was $45.00!  That is crazy that a pint glass margarita is $15.00.   Crappy service, food wasn't great, and it was way overpriced.",

We were a bit hungry and the outside of the place looked good so..... we decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately we checked out their Yelp after we ordered our food......  We both got 2 large beers and that was great, the waitress was a bit rude but in a funny way and was pretty quick to bring us the drinks.   The food.......... Do you know those frozen Old El Paso burritos? They come 2 in a pack and you can get either the beef or the chicken? Yeah, those are far better than the burrito I had at this place. I ate it...... because I was hungry and I'm not super picky at the end of the day.... but once I finished it, I realized how much that burrito sucked!!! It was dry, bland, the meat was tough.... terrible.  Lastly, I'd like to comment on the cleanliness of this establishment. If the front of the restaurant is a reflection to what the kitchen looked like...... it worries me a little. It was filthy! So many dirty table all over the place!  Next trip we are sticking to Jersey Mikes.",

Anyway, me being the world traveler myself (if you consider U.S. the world which many Americans do), stopped by the Tequileria for lunch before my flight back to L.A.  By the way, Southwest boarding system is awful!!  The Tequileria is, like many airport spots, overpriced and underwhelming.  It's not uncommon these days to find pretty good food at airports these days.  I've gone to a couple spots in Dulles that were quite good.  This is not one of them.  I ordered just a plate of carne asada tacos, which comes with 3 typical food truck-size tacos.  Beef was tender but sauce was not great, and the tortilla was too dry.  Not enough cilantro and chili that would really make the flavor.  I've gotten used to a particular style that makes this dish very predictable and quite satisfying, but theirs is different and not for the better.  A good size Dos Equis is always good, so that helped to wash it down.  The service is again typical airport; not rude but not necessarily pleasant, not slow but not in a hurry.  Decor is sufficiently festive, with lots of TVs.  Table-for-1 Factor:  If you can't feel comfortable eating by yourself at the airport...",

Even though I'm not big on Jose Cuervo, tequila sounded good so I decided to give it a try.  I sat @ the bar & Raymond (AKA Raymundo on his nametag - LMAO) was my bartender/server. I had a really long time to kill (5 hours) so I figured I'd take my time deciding what I wanted to eat and drink. Everything on the food menu looked delicious & even though I was completely undecided, Raymundo was very patient with me. I finally ordered the taco salad w/ shrimp & it was absolutely delicious!  As for the alcohol, I explained that I don't lie Jose Cuervo & Raymundo thought that was funny since I was in a Jose Cuervo Tequileria so that's all they serve. LOL Hey said the margaritas are good, affordable, & come w/2 shots of tequila. However, since I had so much time to kill, I decided to indulge in a couple of double shots of 1800 Silver over ice & it wasn't bad @ all. I actually just bought a bottle of Coconut flavored 1800 earlier today & it's delicious over ice! So I guess I do like Jose Cuervo @ times. LOL  There seems to be mixed reviews about the service. I had excellent service & since I was sitting at the bar, I found out that most of the people who work there are pretty hilarious! They were cracking jokes, making funny comments under their breaths, & acting up like I do with my co-workers. Seems like quite a few of them have been working there for a long time.  Overall, I had delicious food, tasty tequila, & great service! I look forward to going back next time I'm hanging out in the Southwest terminal in LV.",

She was very personable and enjoyable to talk with, no matter how brief our interactions were.  She took great care of us and had great suggestions for dinner options.  I ended up choosing the chicken quesadillas, and in all honesty, they were ok.  They satisfied my hunger which is what I really needed at that time.  Minus the fact we almost missed our flight, we enjoyed our experience.",

One piece of stale toast comes with order and it was cold. The coffee looked and tasted like brown water. Only ate the stale cold toast and paid $20 for the privilege!!",

It's a seat yourself kind of place and while it took a little longer than usual for our server to get to us, (I think he had more tables than he could reasonably manage) he was very nice and took our order in no time.  The wifey and I both ordered 3 tacos.  So the food comes out 10 or 15 minutes later and it looked like something that a high school cafeteria would have. Cold tortillas, lukewarm chicken, and soggy lettuce.    Neither of us could manage to even finish the first one.  We both had stomach aches on the flight home, and thought that a case of \"mud butt\" was sure to come. Thankfully it never did, and that is the highest compliment I can give this place...Thank you Jose Cuervo Tequileria...at least you didn't give us mud butt.",

I usually get there with enough time to stop for a drink or snacks at this tequileria. Their Jack n Cokes are about $12 each, but you can make it a double, in a tall glass, for only $4 more. So $64 plus tip got us a couple of rounds of airport-strength drinks. Can't complain about the price though when you have good service (or, when youre ordering drinks from an airport in Vegas at all! No complaining in Vegas!!!)  Thankfully, Stacie was AWESOME. She sold us on the doubles... twice! She was very friendly and social and just fun to have at our table. Even put the second round into plastic cups so we could walk around and gamble with them. You could tell she loves her job by the way she interacted with us, and even how she introduced herself to the tables near us as well.  I ended up not eating here, but I did get some salsa to go, to dip French fries in. I'm not kidding.... I had two-day old garlic fries, ordered with room service in our hotel, and one-day old McDonalds fries, both of which I'd packed up in our rush to leave. So... yeah, at the end of a $3,000 weekend I had no problem saving money and eating something from the night before. Though, I guess I always eat weird leftovers! ;)",

I eventually moved to the bar because the bartender was at least serving the people sitting there. The bartender and the waitress were gabbing on about who left the bar and went where. Totally inappropriate conversation in front of customers. Especially since they weren't saying very nice things about this person. Now I understand why the waitress ignored me because she was clearly preoccupied with work gossip.   The Bartender took my order pretty fast and he was actually pretty professional, but that is where my one star ends. The food was pretty bad and I thought expensive for the quality. To be honest I have no idea what the heck I ordered because it was just so unmemorable. Honestly folks save your money and go to starbucks. I have no idea how this place is still in business.",

I've known Melissa for almost a decade now, who said my other fav bartender, besides her, Joey moved to D Gates.  They are under new management so if it was a locals place, outside of the airport, I think they'd have better reviews.    They no longer serve Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio & the new one is not good, but the Margarita's, orange vodka & soda & specialty drinks are great!  You can't go wrong w/ the nachos & I've always wanted to order the chimichanga, which is enormous & looks tasty!  I just can't eat that much before departure.  If I had someone to share it w/ I hope to next time!  Also you can pick what you'd like in your enchiladas, tacos or Nachos.  It is always packed & for the airport they should have at least four stars.  Guess I see things differently since I flight monthly.  Cheers!",

    "text": "This review is from my husband, Chris, who visited this establishment today at around 11:30.  Although it was almost empty, it took almost five minutes for the 3 waitstaff who were busy chatting with each other to tell me to seat myself.    Upon seating, I did have my beverage order taken.  Beverage order arrived, she asked what salsa I wanted and if I ordered more than one level of heat they'd charge me extra.  She was kind enough to mix the two after giving me a sample of what they had to fit my palate; very kind waitstaff once engaged.  It's no wonder they were chatting because they did not have enough patrons in the restaurant to be engaged.  The manager had no control over the waitstaff whatsoever.  When I said I wanted one carnitas taco, they said they come in sets of three; I said I didn't want three and didn't want to waste food.  I asked to speak to the manager.  The manager came out and said they only serve them in threes; the manager said if they did that they'd have to do it for everyone and they get too busy in here to do that.  Remember, at the time there were only about 10 other patrons in a restaurant that appears to be able to hold up to 100, maybe more.    I would have been happy to take one taco and pay for three as to not waste food but that option wasn't offered.  The manager's inability to try to please a customer turned me off enough that I paid for my chips and salsa and left, so I can't review the food.  I'm confused at the lack of good customer service, especially at a restaurant in an airport as busy as Las Vegas.  The manager today cost this restaurant business and my future recommendation.",

Some Mexican food sounded like it would hit the spot so we walked into the Tequileria.  It looked a bit dirty and disorganized in the restaurant even though it wasn't a super busy travel day. It's self seating but we didn't see our server for several minutes. The whole time it seemed that the server was trying to nickel and dime us. There are two sizes of draft beers on the menu, and instead of asking which size we would want the server quickly left with our order and brought back the huge and more expensive size for my mom and the wrong beer for me. The prices for the beer were steep - I was charged $8 for a bottle of Corona. After we had taken about two sips, the server was already trying to push another round on us.  We wanted something to snack on so we opted for the nachos with chicken. They were pretty gross and also a big ripoff. It tasted like they used cheese from a can and the chicken was cold and flavorless. I think we paid about $15 for something that was stale and had poor ingredients. When it was time for us to pay, the server was carrying the credit card around without the bill or the folder. This made me a bit nervous because it would have been a lot easier to use it for the wrong table or misplace it.  Avoid! Avoid!",

So they earn a star just for having table service available. They earn another star because the waitress I had was very nice and food came out quickly. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos and they were decent. Not super flavorful, but they were hot and clearly made to order which is a plus. If I were comparing this to other airport food options rather than reviewing it on it's own merits, I'd probably give it four stars, but I definitely wouldn't choose to come here if it were a restaurant in my neighborhood.",

So much so that the table next to me ordered them as well. It's not a plate splattered with cheese, it's more of an authentic enchilada plate, which I really appreciated. It's also large enough to share between two or maybe even three people. Highly recommend particularly if you're in the corner of the terminal that's mostly Southwest flights.   My waitress was on point. No complaints there. If anything, they could add more electrical hubs/outlets, which seemed to be lacking for a place like Vegas. Add some free chips and salsa to anyone buying a drink and they'll be the best spot in the airport!",

The restaurant spans across the lower end of C-gate (past Starbucks), roughly between C5/C6, near another food court (BK lounge, a BBQ place, and salad/sandwich place), a walk up bar, and a small gaming area.   My server wasn't anything to write home about, but I could hear some others interacting with their tables in a very personable manner based on the setting.   I tried the ultimate marg (boozy and big) and the impossible burger for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. If I didn't know otherwise I would have thought it was just slightly salty beef. A really good imitation product, dare I say among the best.   It's obviously overpriced because it's the airport, but I would definitely stop in again on a 3+ hour wait at LAS. But I would also probably try Sammy's (Hagar) bar and grill not far away.",

Considering the options I gave Mexican food the benefit of the doubt as it generally always comes through.   I started with a strawberry margarita and I don't know what part of it was strawberry and what part of it was margarita. It was the saddest I had ever seen or tasted. Thereafter I thought I would order chips and salsa to start. I asked my waiter if if was meant to share and he said \"yes, I would say for two\". So I'm thinking I'll be getting a Chili's size basket which I can finish myself, the lack of self restriction with chips and salsa in front of you is real. Here comes a basket and salsa enough for probably 4-6! I would've looked and felt crazy ordering an entree at that point that I probably couldn't finish so I munched on the chips and salsa. The salsa lacked much flavor, certainly didn't taste any authentic. The chips weren't anything to brag about either.   Service was fine. I was able to get my margarita packed to go when I was ready to head to my gate.   I didn't order a meal so my review is on the basis of the chips and salsa and margarita alone, take it with a grain of salt. Expect airport prices and mediocre food. The reviews clearly illustrate it.",

My waitress was Melissa she was so sweet and helpful recommended a few drinks ended up with a mimosa and the fruit and yogurt. I came in around 6ish and there were a few people there but around 7am it started to get a little busy. I would definitely come here again to try food and the Bloody Mary which looked delicious",

My chicken tacos were decent. Edible but nothing special.   The beer list is corporate, but at least has an IPA - even if it is Goose Island.   Service is friendly for an airport spot. They were fast. Got me my second beer in a to go cup so I could take it to my gate (yes, they allow this is in Vegas) and cashed me out fast.   If I am in this airport again I would definitely go here. The only other place in LV airport that might be better is Pei Wei, but it is always packed.",

Three Chicken Enchiladas appeared. Nicely garnished with sour cream, lettuce, salsa verde, queso fresco. Rice and beans accompanied the plate.

But that's not a very high bar... :-) You seat yourself, and after we did, it was really hard to flag down a waiter. Even after she acknowledged us, it took a while for her to return to our table to take our order. She seemed rushed/trying to rush us. However, the food came out pretty fast.  - Nachos ($12.99 + extra $4.00 for barbacoa) I got it without sour cream and queso fresco. Crisp (heavily) salted chips. Meat was tender (similar flavor profile to Chipotle's barbacoa, honestly). Average queso sauce -- needed more of a kick. Pico was good, and the salsa was actually the best part of the dish: tasted fresh and good flavor. Wish it came with guac, though!  Overall, it's decent food, and I'd recommend it if you're hungry and stuck in the airport. But don't come expecting great prices or service.",

The food is painfully mediocre, but the worst part is that the drink prices are flat out offensive.  Prices aren't listed on the drink menu, of course, but I don't have a problem paying $8 or $9 for a basic drink.  I ordered the house margarita, only to discover on the bill that it was over $15.  The waitress told us she wasn't \"allowed\" to mention the price when people ordered.  The brusque, rude, manager told us flatly she had no discretion and couldn't help us.  I've never, ever, heard of a restaurant manager who didn't have authority to fix bills when problems came up.  Either she was lying, or Jose Cuervo is an unethical company that goes out of its way to not list drink prices, forbid waitresses from mentioning prices (the fact the waiters have to be told this is proof there's a problem), and deny managers any authority, just so they can wrangle $15 out of travellers for a sugary, sub-par margarita.",

WTF really? for a cup of premix and a shot of tequila. this place is pathetic. If someone is willing to pay $25 for a drink the least you could do is make it a good one. I hate this place... DO NOT GO THERE it is bland menu food also (which i already knew from previous experience), but even worse drink menu. I was tempted to refute the tab but didn't want to create a fuss$14 for the glass of premix syrup + $8.99 for a (small) shot of tequila.

You recognize the name Jose Cuervo for tequila's, but then wonder if this \"bar\" even had real food or just happy hour crud.  They actually serve restaurant styled food minus the usual utensils made out of metal and ceramic plates.  Food was served on plastic plates, plastic cups, and plastic utensils.  This created a less than memorable experience, subtracts from it.   The food is decent but detracted by the plastic experience.  Most of the cocktails came in plastic cups.  The sodas came with free refills.  I ordered a margarita but was surprised by the bill which said there was a double shot of tequila.  I did not believe it at first because I did not taste any double alcohol in the margarita but as I got up to walk and then I realized there was a double shot.  The reason I came to this place was to look for an alternative to the airport fast food eateries like Burger King or Subway.  Got almost the full dine in experience.  This place looks to be usually packed, with servers taking on several tables at a time.  I've noticed it on a few flights out of Vegas. I don't think the food here is going to be outstanding to most people on their first visit.  I did not really appreciate this place knowing that there was still Alejandro's Tex Mex to be tried but after having tried both on separate occasions, I think Jose Cuervo Tequileria is the better place to go at the Vegas airport.",

I ordered the three carnitas tacos on corn tortillas.  I was hungry.  I thought something tasted funny,  and noticed into the second taco that they were flour tortillas.  I mentioned it to the server,  she acknowledged the error,  and took the plate away.  And brought me a plate of two corn shelled tacos,  instead of three.  Which were tasty, credit where credit due.    As polite as the server was,  she kept mentioning that she was leaving soon,  to the point of annoyance. When she brought me my check,  she kept hovering to see if I signed my tab.    Their tap beer selection is nothing special,  and there are other lounges in the terminal.    I miss the old menu and selection of beverages.",

If you must have food, spend $6 bucks on a slice of pizza on Sbarro rather than spending it here.",

So I was stuck in the Vegas airport (once again, yes, a virtual Groundhog's Day of Lost in Lodi, only slightly farther east), and I see this lady at Cuervo's Tequileria with this big burrito. I say, \"What's that?\" She says its the carnitas burrito. That thing looks huge, I think.   So I order it. Mine comes up out much smaller than the lady's. But it wasn't bad. The sauce had a lime cilantro taste, and the pork was soft.  Would I eat here again? No, at least not until I am stuck in Vegas again and desperate. Did I see other desirables on the menu or at the other tables? Yes, but nothing more interesting than your average Mexican no-frills restaurant. Did I find the service or the accommodations fair? No, I was at an airport.  The price? Well, it wasn't listed, so I suspect that that will change. So I pass that surprise on to you, dear reader. You will be disappointed, and yet, you will be full. Grab a Coke at the nearby Burger King. There's free refills, so get a small. You'll be smiling all over as you wolf down your undersized burrito.

She told me they were no longer serving breakfast and then quickly walked away. So I sat there for another 5 minutes waiting. She didn't even ask me what I wanted to drink. Then, a jovial gal (who I'm assuming is the manager) came over, apologized and took my order.   I waited another 15 minutes or so for my chicken burrito. By this time I was starving. I dug right in and was totally disappointed with the quality of the chicken. Have you ever had canned chicken? That's what it tasted like. I finished it because I was too hungry to send it back. Bleh.",

    "text": "If I could give 0, or simply push a button and close a place, I would. The food was overpriced (it is an airport and it is to be expected), the beverages are the same (again, airport) but the service is awful.  I can handle expensive food that is mediocre in an airport.  I will survive. I cannot deal with service this awful.  I had 2 hours before my flight, ordered a burrito, beer, and chips.  I had to run to get on.  When I ordered I asked if it came with chips and salsa, and was told a small portion, at which point I ordered a side of chips and salsa \"to get with my beer, because I haven't really eaten all day.\"  My beer took 15 minutes and came sans chips and salsa.   I asked again, and another 20 minutes later it came out.  Finally, my burrito arrived, and my beer was almost gone.  She didn't stop to let me order another, or even come check if I wanted one when it was gone.  I thought beverages were where establishments  made their big bucks?  I guess not.   Finally, when I could get her attention (after being done for 30 minutes without her coming back) I asked for my check.  Then I asked again, and again.  I finally had to get up and walk up to the front and demand that they let me pay before I missed my flight.  It was ABSURD.  I get the feeling this became a self fulfilling stereotype.  Older individuals got far superior service, and I am sure she thought \"young guy, probably tips poorly.\"  Damn right I do when I almost miss my flight after asking for my bill three times, and I only have one beer in me after an hour and forty-five minutes.  Give me service, and you get a good tip, give me that kind of service and you don't.  I travel through this airport fairly often these days, and will never be returning here.",

I'm jealous of the patrons behind me that got a better waitress, I'm jealous of all the people that got breakfast before they made it to the airport, I'm even jealous of the peeps eating Burger King for breakfast.  Bottom line, take your money elsewhere is you are deciding what to eat when you're in Gate C. First of all, the service was not good at all. No smiles, no hello's, and I even witnessed the more timid customers wait forever for their checks.  When you finally get service, make sure to order everything at once. I'm talking about your refills, extra sides, extra napkins, etc. This is a must since it's almost impossible to get your server's attention here. Eye contact, the finger wave, and \"excuse me\" just doesn't fly here.  I also think the servers have their invisible ear plugs and blinders on.  Or, i just have my invisible cloak on.  Whatever the reason, the service is just not what they preach here. However, service does improve when your check arrives.  My thoughts, it must be tip time.   As for the food, it's just okay. The food looks better than it tasted. I got their Chicken Chipotle Torta with Chips.  This chicken sandwich was fine, but I decided to eat it bland with nothing on it. No taste, just your average chicken breast for about $10. I also finished all 5 pieces of their tortilla chips that they gave me as a side.  Overall, just okay food with poor services equals 2 Stars in my book.",

    "text": "I had some time to kill between planes and when this happens I like to kill that time with booze. Jose Cuervo Tequileria was right next to my gate and they have a full bar and corn chips... winner in my book. I ordered a mango margarita and decided to get the pork chimichanga.  The drink = TERRIBLE. I've had $3 happy hour margaritas that were better than this $13.49 slushy machine drink. Seriously a waste of money and time. Minimal flavor, minimal alcohol at a very UN-minimal price.  The food = GOOD. I ordered my chimichanga with shredded pork, rice, refried beans, roasted corn, crema, queso fresco and green chili salsa. It was a large portion and surprising very good. In fact I liked it so much that I had it boxed up and carried it back to San Diego with me to finish off when I got home. This place doesn't have the \"authentic\" Mexican food flavor but for airport Mexican or heck Vegas Mexican it's pretty dang good.  The Service = GREAT. My servers name was Laura and she was on point. You seat yourself at this place and Laura had my drink ordered and delivered within 5 min of my sitting down. She was attentive without hovering and so sweet without being irritating about it. And yes, you can be so sweet it's irritating. If I could rate her alone I'd give her 5 stars.  The Cost = Wow and nope. I'd say they could get away with charging $12.59 for my chimichanga and not piss me off but $13.49 for my drink...not at all. The cost of that horrible drink just set me off and I'm still irritated by it.",

    "text": "Totally will not ever eat here again, or any other Jose Cuervo location!!!!    We were super early for a flight from Vegas and had plenty of time to spare for a meal.  Our daughter is pretty picky but she will eat guacamole so we stopped in here.  It was busy, I'll give them that, but it was difficult to find a table because all of the tables were just two seaters.  Having our daughter with us, we needed three seats.  One of the other customers saw us looking around and gave up part of their table for us to use.    We waited FOREVER for a server to come over to our table, after having watched her greet other folks that came in well after us.  When she finally did come to take our drink order, she took one look at our daughter and went off on a rampage.  She said \"Our drink menu is strictly adult! If you want a beer, I can help you out, but if you want anything like a chocolate milk for a kid, you're welcome to go to Burger King and bring it back.\"  Rudeness.  So, we all had water.  We should've just left right then.  It took her a lifetime to bring our waters (they must be difficult to prepare).  When she took our order, we ordered chips with salsa for our girl (the guacamole looked funky!). My husband ordered the burrito.  I ordered the chicken nachos.    Once again, our server took it upon herself to give us advice.  She basically said that we looked like we could use some financial advice and recommended that we only order my nachos, instead of ordering chips and salsa for our girl, too, because the nachos were enough to feed up to three people and it'd be cheaper.  We were furious!   We explained that the girl wasn't going to eat nachos covered in a bunch of crap, so just chips and salsa for her, please.    We waited at least 45 minutes after that for the food to arrive, after watching other people who came in after us get their food before us.  When it arrived, it looked horrific.  Everything was sloppy and mushy and nasty.    The burrito was soggy and unseasoned.    The nachos were so gross; they were 50% chips, 25% melted cheddar cheese (slices?), 20% sour cream and 5% chicken.  It was funky, nasty stuff.  The chips for the girl were stale.  But the salsa verde was good.  Yay.    No way will I ever go back to any of these establishments again!   Ever.",

My girls and I were headed back to the Bay Area from a short Vegas trip and wanted nothing else but to watch the Warrior game on TV before we boarded our flight. If you didn't know already, Vegas is primarily an LA Laker zone (apparently) and Kobe was having his last game that night... of course everyone wanted to see it! But, it was also the night that the Warriors would break the Chicago Bull's  most wins in a single season record. Having both games on was TOTALLY NECESSARY! Thank goodness this place decided to play both games (unlike every other bar in the airport).  Enough of that, besides the basketball games, this place was nothing but uncomfortable. The workers here were just talking smack to each other and discussing their personal problems outright in front of all us customers. If that wasn't uncomfortable enough, one party who was trying to get seated seemed so uneasy about how the servers talked to each other, that they just straight up walked out of the place. Lastly, one of our friends who met up with us had to literally get out of her seat to seek out someone to take her drink order. She wanted to order a margarita, and about three servers just replied with, \"Not my section!\" Or, \"Your server should be coming.\" About twenty minutes of searching for a willing worker, the bartender said, \"Oh honey, you've been waiting too long. Let me just take your drink order.\"   Although I didn't take a bite of their food, I wouldn't recommend for anyone to waste their time here unless this place is the only one playing what you want on TV. Sadly, that was the highlight of this experience.",

Banana Margarita - There's no price on the drink menu, so my server said it was $14-$15, glad it only ended being $13.49.  The drink was good but came in a very small cup for the price.    Chips and Guacamole - At almost $11 I figured, what the hey, it's going on the company expense report and it'll be my dinner.  It's the only thing I ordered and she brought out the wrong dish.  There was a delay in getting my receipt because she put in the right order but had to make a correction.  Instead she brought me Chips and Salsa, which was $6.49.  I said, \"I actually ordered Chips and Guacamole.\"  She says she either take that back or she can add on a small side of guacamole for $1.89.  I don't have time for all this mess so I say, \"Just bring me a small side of guacamole.\"  Well, the guacamole on the bill showed up as $2.89.  It was tiny!  Not to mention, it wasn't fresh made, nor was it packed a few days before at some local distributor, it was the canned stuff that was like a thick soup with no chunks of avocado.  The tortilla chips were like Mission Tortilla Chips, except triangular.  I hate Mission Tortilla Chips.    If you want to stop here and get a drink, that's fine, but the food (not just my dish) seems to be lacking.  If you want to walk around with your drink, order it in a to go cup.  Las Vegas McCarran Airport is rad like that.",

I have had Tequileria before for a quick quesadilla in-between flights and it's pretty hard to screw up a cheese quesadilla. But today was the first time I actually sat down and ate in the restaurant.   My server was friendly enough and took my drink order right away (just a glass of water) - but then it was 10 minutes before I saw the water, or her, again. It was breakfast so I ordered the Huevos Rancheros. The food came out fairly quickly.   The eggs were cooked well, as were the \"home fries\", but everything else was a mediocre, soggy mess. Too much salsa, cold tortillas, cold beans, and overall a kind of \"blah\" breakfast. I was hungry so I ate it, unfortunately - then discovered better breakfast options in other terminals of the airport. Live and learn.",

So we moved to a different table in someone else's section (we hadn't ordered anything and the restaurant has an open seating policy). As we moved, the server whose section we moved to asked us what we were doing and why I was holding a glass of water in a sort of weird accusatory voice. Then when we explained what was going on, she got irritated and said \"Well [your initial] server is probably slammed right now. So that's probably why.\" The rest of the service was all right, but you could tell our server was overwhelmed.

Please keep in mind that this is a review of the food, not the alcoholic drinks here, so I'm coming from a slightly different perspective than the other reviews below mine.  I ordered the Carne Asada Corn Tacos (3 for $11 + tax ~ $12 as of 08/30/2014) and was treated to a fairly yummy mix of red onions, barbecued pork, some guacamole-like sauce, and what I think is cilantro. To be honest, i was pretty happy with the food, but am still wincing about paying $12 for it. I attached a picture below, which makes the tacos look bigger than they actually are. What was even weirder is that they (or at least my cashier) did not give water cups.  She told me to wait in line at the Burger King next door (which would've been another 15 minutes)!  Common!  Keep in mind there's not really seating at the \"Grill\" area and the Tequileria attached to it is dim and more designed for lonely flyers.  I would probably recommend it over your other options at Burger King and Sabarro next door, but I am pretty peeved about their tourist-trap pricing and the way they try to force you into buying an overpriced beverage.",

It's a nice spot to have a drink or something (simple) to eat while waiting for your flight.   The waitresses/bartender  work their you-know-what's off and are so pleasant.  Yes, they get slammed and you might have to rush them along a bit, but it's fine.  It's the airport and everyone they encounter is probably hungover, tired and crabby!!! Lol Hats off to them!",

    "text": "Continuing my liquid diet at the Las Vegas airport, I (and many other passengers) scope out the only full-size, full-service place in this part of Terminal C that might offer a sweet alcoholic treat I would be interested in.  Strawberry Margarita was a frozen blend of Jose Cuervo especial Gold and strawberries.  And indeed, it was enjoyable.  It had BETTER be though, at what they charge.  They won't even show the price on their menu.  I bet they change it every week.  But I guess fifteen dinero per, isn't that much different than prices on the Strip.  Yes, we have some bananas... and mango.  The Tequileria's other fruity margarita flavoras include the Mangorita, Bananarita and Spicy Mangorita, which includes Grand Marnier, sweet and sour mix and Monin Spicy Mango.  There's food here as well.  Get your chips and margaritas on at Jose Cuervo Tequileria, occupying a big rectangular chunk of the floor space around Gates C5 through C10-ish.  A costly but okay way to pass the time waiting for your SWA flight.",

    "text": "Three stars instead of two, because compared to the other dining options at McCarren, this place is a five star spot.  Compared to the world at large, well, you're better off eating just about anywhere else.   I was recently faced with a six hour layover in Vegas, courtesy of my friends at Spirit Airlines, who are unable to get their $hit together. I figured I'd make the best of it and get drunk at the airport, and have a last go at Mexican food before heading back to Boston.  This is the kind of airport gouging that I sometimes find infuriating... no chips and salsa at the table, $10 cocktails, no side salads, etc. Other times I grit my teeth and say nothing, but with such a long layover and such terrible options overall, well, I really just wanted to get out of Vegas.  I ordered a double vodka soda ($15), a full-sized Caesar salad ($9, no side salads as an option here) and a carne asada burrito ($12 I think, maybe $15).  The drink was strong but nothing was especially good about the meal.   Side note here: Logan Airport, in Boston, has a law against price gouging at the airport. Just because you're a captive behind TSA security lines doesn't mean you should have to spend $60 on lunch.  As I was eating the burrito, I kept thinking that something in the seasoning was really familiar. It took a long time for me to recognize it, but that flavor was Taco Bell, which I haven't eaten in about twenty years. So yeah, this isn't great Mexican fare.   Another double vodka soda later, and a few bucks lighter, I was ready to take a nap in the long walkway between terminals. If there are any entrepreneurs looking for an opportunity to open a restaurant in Vegas that serves something other than Taco Bell beef or deep fried everything, I recommend scouting locations in this busy airport! It might be expensive to rent here, but if what you serve is even halfway decent, you'll make a killing.",

Minutes after I left, I realized the waitress had picked up my personal pen with the check after I signed it. It could have been an honest mistake. When i went back in, I couldn't find her in the restaurant and was treated rudely by two other servers when I asked for assistance. One refused to even tell me the name if the waitress that had just been working our table.   In the end, after standing around with no help finding my property, I had to leave for my flight and chalk this up to another Las Vegas Stupid Tax. The fleecing of the flock continues... I hope she uses my nice pen to fill out her next job application.",

Popeyes chicken was 10 bucks for a three piece meal so I my pulled pork nachos weren't that far off.  I ordered them and they came pretty quick.  The order was huge, with two types of salsa on the side.  If I ordered meatless Nachos I would say this is a 3 star meal, but the nachos came with about 2 tablespoons of pork.  I literally had to search my plate at first for any signs of meat.  Also, might be coincidence, but within 15 minutes of finishing and paying for meal I had to make an emergency run to the restroom.  One time shot, but it certainly did not agree with me.  Next time might try Popeyes!",

It was very decent.  Lots of food for 10 bucks.  The service was quick.  Its right across from C14.   I would come here if you want something beyond the overpriced fast food places.",

We ordered chips and guacamole, both seemed to be prepackaged, I was really hoping for some home made chips! These seemed to be Tostitos chips from the grocery store. We ordered a chicken quesadilla and chicken tacos. The quesadilla was better than the tacos but that's not saying much. The tacos were nasty.. Reminded me of cafeteria food. It would have been one thing if we paid $6. But we ordered chips, guacamole, tacos, an ice tea, and a quesadilla and it came to $42.50. Taco Bell is much better.",

Starts with raw meat and good burger they said. Got chicmichanga instead and chopped taco salad with pork. Salad out quickly but had to wait on the other. Arrived huge,hot and delish! Enjoyed this lunch very much. And the variety of  Mexican music added to the ambiance... could have been a tad lower though...  Would definitely eat here again...",

He just walked away without a word. Then came back and said are you ready yet. Like where in the hell is the greeting and asking if we would like to order drinks. So we ordered and he just left again somewhat rudely and definitely unfriendly. When he came back he just threw the food down and walked away.  No utensils or napkins. We had to ask another server for the bill. Never saw this unprofessional server again. Thank God.  Oh... The food was just ok, salty and stale tortilla.  But then again it's an airport restaurant.  8/30/14  3:30pm.",

They are on par with Taco Bell. The beer was $10. I could tell the wait staff was hustling and they seem anxious. They were working hard. Stop here for layovers frequently and was alway curious. Curiosity satisfied. Don't plan on coming back. Still waiting for my check.",

Lots of people just sitting and hangin and hanging out on their phones after eating. Total chaos. The staff was not helpful. Other customers would walk in after us and get tables before. the chaos made it impossible to try to find a table and enjoy a meal. The only way we got a table was to find someone who just finished eating and ask if we could have their table. I ordered a chicken quesodislla and my other half ordered pork tacos. the waiter didn't write anything down and sent us the wrong orders. Twice. The chicken looked exactly like the pork but when we asked the waiter he said it was chicken. Wasn't impressed all. I would avoid this place and go for another option in terminal C",
