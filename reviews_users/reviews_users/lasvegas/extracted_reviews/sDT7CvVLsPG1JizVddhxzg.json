All good quality ingredients, no corners cut and most importantly, the soup stock was perfect.   A pleasant surprise is that they offer you Banana Blossom as part of the vegetables to dunk in your soup, I don't know anywhere that offers this and its one of the traditional must have ingredients.  The restaurant itself is nice and spacious, very clean and nice positive colours. The service was very good, didn't have to ask for a refill on drinks once.  I would defo go back, next time to try some Pho",

It's a nice added touch to be treated nicely although what's most important is the quality of the food which they definitely do not short in.  Oh yah it's also clean too!",

I have been here about 8 times or so and have gotten various things on the menu.  Unlike other pho places where the broth is really bland and very blah, pho mailan you can really taste the spices they use.  The eggrolls are yummy too.   The sandwiches I get occasionally to go for lunch tomorrow, but I would have to say that they aren't 5 star, maybe 3.  All in all its yummy, the staff is friendly, and it has free wi-fi for my entertainment pleasure.  :)",

Not easy to find in most Vietnamese restaurants.  As a non Asian with a very western taste who likes most Vietnamese food as long as it is not too traditional (ie uses shrimp paste), I look for these types of Vietnamese restaurants who have westernized their menu.    We had our family reunion there, with lots of local and non local Vietnamese and myself.  We all left full and very happy with our meals.  My wife really likes Bun Bo Hue, which is also not often  well prepared, but here, she was delighted to find it very authentic.  Their combination pho made my mother in law very happy.  The price was very reasonable and the quantities were generous.  The tables are designed for large family gatherings, but they have tables for small groups as well.  The service was good and the place was very clean, something also rare to find in many restaurants.  Hope that this place considers serving Banh Xeo, Vietnamese Crepe, in the future.",

They are very attentive and friendly, which is a huge plus compared to similar restaurants.  I ordered the Bun Bo Hue, which is my second time trying this dish.  I was not disappointed at all. I like how they do not use the pork blood in this dish.  Chris ordered the beef pho with rare steak and he enjoyed it, but said he had better (3/5).  We also loveee spring rolls with peanut sauce, so of course we try it at every vietnamese place we go to.  We liked it and will probably always order that when we come back, plus it's $3.95 (i think).  I will definitely come back and try the bun thit nuong (sp?), another one of my vietnamese faves.  *oh I ordered thai tea*, but I guess I learned my mistake from ordering a thai drink from a vietnamese restaurant.  It tasted different and obviously not authentic. It still tasted decent, but I wouldn't recommend it.   I'll try coconut juice next time.",

As others have mentioned, some of the food is a little plain but the ingredients seem high quality and some of it is quite good.  As for the more moderately good things we have eaten there, it might just be that we have grown to prefer the depth of flavors that you find in Thai food over Vietnamese food, which seems a litte tamer.  But we still like Vietnamese food.  Also, we're not usually beef eaters, so we can't comment on that part of the menu which might well be the best part.  What keeps us returning is that the relationship between price and what you get is very good.  Staff/owners are very friendly, place is clean, seating always available although there is a steady stream of people coming and going including some getting take-out, and the food is always at least good if not great.  I'm not sure of where else (at a restaurant with table service, anyway) we could get two main courses, an appetizer, and two hot teas, leave a 20% tip, and have spent less than $30 for two people.  We'll be back, probably fairly regularly.",

The management here is welcoming and the service was great!  Upon entering the smell is amazing. I just wanted some takeout but decided to stay the smell was so good. I decided upon a few things; chicken satay, the pork cabbage rolls, a chicken bahn mi sandwich, the seafood pho, and the husband had the beef brisket pho (all shared between 2 adults and 3 kids). EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. I have picky eaters, and my kids tried, and liked, everything they ate here.  The sandwich was flavorful, the pork rolls were juicy (and the peanut sauce was the bomb - even though I have always hated it!). However, the pho stole the show. Flavorful broth, tender meat, and delicious veggies. And the price tag on the food we ordered? $35. I will be frequenting this place again. And again. And again.",

Sorry I wont be back I will stick with my spot Pho Saigon 8. I guess I will deal with bad service for great food.",

The service was excellent and I thought the decor in the place was really cute. Everyone was very friendly and made sure we were happy with our food. I also love the fact that they have a small kids pho so even her three year old walked out with a happy belly.  While we were there they were hanging up a new sign for their happy hour pricing. Only $5 for a bowl of soup or any appetizer. What a great deal!",

Instead, a teenage employee in the back waited for me to look at him and pointed to a booth where I could sit. A lot of the workers there looked young and they were not attentive at all.   The pho tasted good, but it smelled horrible. It smelled just like a pet store! It was hard for me to eat it because of the stench and I'm surprised that I never got sick from it last night or this morning. Also, they gave me my pho without chopsticks or a spoon. I tried looking for a waiter so I could ask for one, but again, they are all inattentive. I had to get up from my seat and ask for one since all of the employees were talking amongst themselves in a corner of the restaurant.   I honestly did not give a tip because it felt like I was rushed out of there (it was not busy at all) and I was not paid attention to while the waiters constantly checked up on the other customers. You're better off at Lemongrass Cafe where their staff is actually nice and their pho is amazing and cheap.",

I drive by 5 pho places on the way to Mailan, but I wouldn't even consider going to any of the others. I took my parents there, and now they take all their friends there. I usually eat there about twice a week.   We've tried almost all the appetizers and haven't found anything we don't like yet. I always get the P10, chicken pho. It's the only place I've been to that serves thick, white meat chicken in their pho. No dark meat or gristle ever!  That's the main reason I only go to Pho Mailan.   It's clean and nicely decorated inside. The staff is polite, especially the owner. He takes a lot of pride in his food. Prices are reasonable, especially now that they offer $5 pho during happy hour from 3-5pm.",

However, I guess things are more expensive and smaller portions out in Henderson....It would be a place to stop by if you want some authentic Vietnamese food in this area though! One thing I'm really happy with was the fact that our server gave us the option to split our bill individually before we even considered it!

The broth had a little more flavor than other Pho places and it didn't taste like just cilantro. For people who like spicy I recommend putting in the jalapenos they serve with some chili garlic sauce.  I also had some kind of Pork sandwich. I forgot the name. But it was also good. It was served on a crusty french baguette with cucumber slices and some sore of carrot/cabbage slaw mix. The pork itself had a sweet sauce around it, somewhat like General Tsos or Sesame chicken.   Good service and the place was extra clean. I will be returning.  Update.  I've made this place my goto spot for Pho. After eating at at least 5 other Pho places, Pho Mailan easily has the best. It's super clean, the service is extremely friendly and the food is very very good. The happy hour special is great. During the week from 3-5pm they have 5 dollar bowls of Pho, and 3 dollar sandwiches. What a steal!  My only problem with this place is that it's only open til 9pm, and since I work odd hours if i get the itch for Pho I have to travel to Spring Mountain and eat sub par alternatives in the middle of the night. I wish they we're open late!!!  I've eaten at Pho Mailan like once every two weeks for the past 4 months and never have had one complaint.",

    "text": "After seeing so many of my friends posting pics of yummy looking pho to their facebook pages, I finally convinced my boyfriend to be adventurous and try it out with me since a new Pho restaurant opened up near us.  This used to be EVOS, a place I was sad to see go. But, they retained the clean, fresh ambience. It looked nice, maybe a bit too bright for my liking. I am sure I would have enjoyed my experience more in the dark as a matter of fact because my dish looked less than appealing.  About that dish, I told the nice waiter that we were very excited that this was our first experience with pho and asked if he could point us in the right direction for ordering. He picked something for us on the first page of the menu and said it's what everyone orders and we are sure to love it. I am going to attach an image of what he brought out. It was not what I expected at all, especially after seeing others images of pho that had more veggies and lighter looking noodles. I certainly didn't expect a hoof looking thing (others have commented that it looks more like a cervix) along with lots of grissle to arrive in my bowl of faux pho.   Because the service was so good, we decided not to say anything. And decided to pretend we were in Vietnam and that this must be traditional pho, whereas what other have been eating elsewhere must be the modernized version. I have since learned from someone who has eaten pho in Vietnam that what I ate didn't look like the pho she had in her travels. Oh well.  I really did love the service at this restaurant though. They were very attentive and nice. I'm thinking I just ordered the wrong thing? Will try out Lemongrass Cafe once I recover from this experience.  ***Update*** We should have expressed our disappointment to the staff while we were there but they were so nice that I didn't want to make them feel bad! Lesson learned. My apologies to the staff for not saying anything while we were there. I am sure they would have made good on the situation.",

    "text": "Pho is always my go to meal, especially when it's a little chilly and gloomy out--it just screams pho weather. :)   I love coming to this place for my pho cravings mainly because of the generous serving of meat that comes in a small bowl and the super tasty and tangy broth. The broth is what makes it or breaks it for me when it comes to pho and I can honestly say that Pho Mai Lan, does their broth RIGHT! I barely have to put any hoisin or limes to get it to my liking.   Another thing that's a must have item on their menu is their Vietnamese style coffee. I am literally fueled by coffee alone so I take it pretty seriously lol  \\_()_/  it's brewed traditionally and comes with the right amount of sweetened condensed milk.   A great time to come here is definitely during lunch because their regular beef pho and chicken pho bowls are just $5.00!  With the temperature slowly decreasing, pho weather is everyday, So head on down to Anthem and give this gem of a place a try! :)",

    "text": "First time there in a family group of 10.  I believe if your group is 6 or more, they automatically tack on 18% gratuity. Now if the service were reflective of that, then fine.  However, considering I had to ask for my iced coffee 3 times, (& it wasn't busy) I'd like the option of reducing that amount. The conversation with the waitress was moot as she didn't understand what I was saying.  The food was good for the most part, here's what I didn't like: I had the beef bahn mi - the meat flavor is great, but it was a lot of gristle which I had to spit out. It's like they cut the fatty hard outside of the beef and use that (if you've eaten Hawaiian style teri beef, you get it). There was also very little to nil mayo on it. Heads up: if your upper palate is weak, don't eat this because the crusty bread will cut up the roof of your mouth. I should've known better.  One pho didn't come with a soup spoon, but that's minor.  Husband had B1 - bun, but he says he's had better from 2 other places in town. I'm not sure if we'll go back.",

They have a Happy Hour from 3-6pm so I timed it right. I liked their menu, they have a lot of good selections. The restaurant itself has quite a few tables and is very nicely decorated, bright and cheery.   I ordered a Pho Tai Chin and thai iced tea, and both were delivered quickly. The Pho has a nice balance of meat and noodles, just a bit light on meat for me. The broth was also a little blah, so it required a few limes and some hoison sauce to perk it up. Served piping hot, I had to wait a bit until it was temperature ready to eat.   I would come back for sure. Its not as good as my favorite, Sidestreet Pho, but its fairly priced and decent. There's not much Pho in Henderson, so any potential business owners.....there's a goldmine out here waiting for you.",

With less than 10 tables of customers they are already slow like this, I can't imagine what would happen if they are full house. Perhaps they need to hire more servers or just shut the damn thing down. Didn't get a chance to mention the food was NOT authentic at all!!! Would NOT ever come again!!!!",

The bun with grilled meats and shrimp was pretty salty.  The eggrolls ain't all that.  The spicy chicken tossed in fish sauce, oh so yummy...may sound gross but man, this is bar food.  Yeuummm!  If you are looking for the vietnamese cafe with the dripping filter, this is the place for you.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  I will be coming back here again!  Happy Eating!",

We did not receive menus after the tables were cleaned. After looking around we took 2 from another table. While waiting around for a high chair we flagged down an employee to ask for more menus and she said they were probably out. Haha wtf? There weren't any other tables waiting to order. She handed us a few menus that were not cleaned. We had 3 different people come to our table asking if we were ready to order but no one asked what drinks we wanted. I don't know if this was at shift change...it was 7pm. Two of us ordered pho and the rest of us ordered something different. All four of us received our meals at different times. We only received one soup spoon for two phos. The server who we had for the majority of the meal was polite enough, maybe she realised what a shit show we were in...but the icing on the cake was when I went to use the bathroom they were out of toilet paper, there was pee on the sink, the sink looked like it's never been properly cleaned and the floors were covered in a black slug along the wall. Gross. I hope the kitchen wasn't like that too. So their saving grace for the two stars? The food was actually good.",

We always have to have the shrimp fried rice with either the spring rolls or eggrolls. On top of the usual seafood pho and spicy beef noodle soup. Amazing!! We have not had a bad experience here (ok maybe once but that was many years ago and we blame it on shark week) please enjoy this hidden gem",

We got 2 beef soups with meatballs and thinly sliced beef, calamari, fried egg rolls and a banh mi vietnamese sandwich. The food was excellent. We enjoyed all, the broth was a little bland for my taste. I added some fish sauce, hoisin sauce, sriracha and pepper. My wife thought it was good, not a big deal for me.  If I could put a sixth star I would, the Vietnamese sandwich was excellent. I got bm1. With beef and pork, and it was tasty. I been tempted to get it for lunch because its so close.  We will back for sure, thank you Pho Mailan.",

I was craving a good banh mi sandwich & after yelping for banh mi in Henderson, I found this Vietnamese restaurant that I had somehow previously overlooked. I had hubby pick up 3 sandwiches on his way home from work; the grilled marinated pork, the grilled marinated beef & the grilled chicken. The sandwiches themselves were pretty good although the meat is def not typical of what you get in a banh mi but more of what you would order on top of rice. The veggies were also a little over marinated for my taste.  The biggest oversight though in my opinion, was the complete lack of cilantro. Wha??? That's prob my favorite part of the all mighty banh mi.  The other issue was they said it would be 20-30 mins but when hubby got there right at 15 mins, they were sitting on the counter waiting for us which led to slightly soggy sandwiches.  I would prob order from them again but I will def be sure to ask for the cilantro next time & arrive earlier & take my chances with a short wait.",

I ordered shrimp and chicken and it was served on a platter soaking in a brown liquid with half cooked noodles COVERED in broccoli, there was so much broccoli. It was the most disgusting concoction I've ever seen. It looked like they literally took every leftover bit of food and piled it on. Needless to say, we will never go back. We'll find another Pho, where the food is edible. This is a total letdown.",

When he came back he had a FULL ORDER of egg rolls!! Get it together new guy!! 2nd. It's one thing to have a sh*t ton of gnats flying around your restaurant but when I take a bite of my pho and a huge fly comes floating to the top of the bowl that's out of control!! 3rd. We will NEVER be back especially after reading that there was a dead roach on a damn table!! Fix your bug issues!!  GROSS! Seriously guys you are messing up! I hope you get it together for your future customers! GOOD LUCK. The only good thing they have going is the server Thi!! He should leave there himself to somewhere better!",

Plus when you call for takeout it is ready in like 10 minutes. Overall really great pho, if you live in the area I recommend!",

The sign outside as Voted #1 in Vegas is BOGUS and no longer an accurate description of this restaurant. The food is super salty. Food is mediocre at best!! The restaurant is dirty. The utensils are very old and could use a good polish and a good scrub. The service was awful. VERY, VERY, VERY slow and RUDE waitress. The waitress kept forgetting our table and the restaurant was not busy at all. Had to ask for water twice and the waitress forgot to put the order in the kitchen. We waited and watched while two other tables were served their food. The only time the waitress came back to our table is to give the check and she hovered and stood over me while I took the money out of my wallet. RIDICULOUS. I do not recommend this restaurant at all. There are plenty of other Vietnamese restaurant down on Eastern worth checking out.",

They said that they do not have it. How can a Vietnamese restaurant does not have lemon for their customer? 2) the Pho came like a luke warm water, and the beef was overcooked. 3) we ordered BBQ chicken and egg rolls on the top of rice. Their egg rolls were ok, but, the BBQ chicken was darker and burnt. On a whole, their foods, from our experiences, are not qualified to be called as VIETNAMESE foods",

Needless to say, I was looking for a family-owned place with flavorful food. This is one of those places.  I ordered P4 (Pho Tai, Nam - Noodle soup with sliced round-eye steak, well-done flank) and my husband had P6 (Pho Chin, Nam - Noodle soup with well-done brisket and well-done flank) and we shared A17 (Smoked  Salmon Rolls - Smoked salmon wrapped in rice paper with mixed freshvegetable and pickles). Everything was flavorful and delicious. We got it to-go and it came packaged well with plenty of fixings for the soup. If you're someone who likes a lot of noodles in your Pho, get the Large size (same amount of broth but more noodles and fixings). The smoked salmon rolls were very fresh tasting and the peanut sauce was tasty.  Prices are very reasonable also ($8 for regular size Pho, $9 for large). We will be back!",

I finally decided to try Pho MaiLan for an early lunch under just that circumstance. I'm not convinced that they have Vietnamese ownership, but they do have a typical menu of appetizers, rice dishes, noodle dishes, and of course everyone's favorite Vietnamese beef noodle soup.  For me, it was straight to the Pho Chin Nam ($8.50 for my large bowl). The broth is fairly light on spices and flavor, but there was a passable amount of green onion and cilantro, and the meat had the tenderness and flavor that I expected. They didn't give enough Thai basil for two people and the bean sprouts weren't completely fresh, but the lime wedges and jalapenos were nice (although I didn't find that the lime helped the broth much this time). Gotta appreciate the plastic chopsticks instead of bamboo when you can get them too.  This could easily be 3 stars in another city or circumstance, but I enjoyed my meal enough that I'd give Pho MaiLan another shot some time. Call it \"3.5 stars rounded up\" if you will. It's a good enough soup with most of the elements of pho that it'd work in a pinch (namely the situation of not being in California).",

Only thing i didnt think was that the noodles were waaaaay overcooked, to the point there the noodles were all broken in my bowl :(  Others got the pho, which they seemed to like, and some got the pho ga and it seemed ok. Kind of plain tbh.   A bowl of noodles will cost you around 8-9 dollars. The spring rolls were pricey though, 6 dollars for 2 small rolls cut in half :(   I think I might come back though next time I'm in Vegas!",

I also tried the calamari which was so yummy! I loved the batter - more of a beer batter than usual - i dig.   For beverages - our whole table got the club soda limeaide? It was so refreshing. Specially in combination with the hot steamy soup.   The service was also particularly nice - I'm not used to being greeted with so many smiles at a Pho restaurant. I felt very welcome.

That's about all I liked :( My husband and I went here for dinner on a Friday night and they were definitely overwhelmed with the amount of people in there. I'd say the restaurant was a little over half full.   We ended up getting the wrong appetizer delivered to us, and the waiter spilled a bit of my husbands pho on his hands when he delivered it to our table. We both ordered pho and it was underwhelming. It wasn't very hot at all...just barely warm. It wasn't enough to cook the rare steak that was in my pho. The noodles were also overcooked and just mush.....blech. The broth was pretty weak and had a weird funky aftertaste to it too. Almost like a smokey flavor to it. I didn't care for it at all. No one came to check on us and we never got refills on our drinks.  We waited a while to get our check and finally my husband just got up and went to the counter to pay. While paying I saw someone else got pho spilled on them big time. I was confused since I saw so many 5 star reviews on yelp which was why I chose to try this place out. Maybe I caught them on a bad night? They definitely need to get their act together or hire more servers. Give this place a womp womp. Don't think I'll be heading back anytime soon.",

The wait time and ambience were average. The bean sprouts and jalapenos were fresh. I'm used to having mint but experiencing the actual lemongrass was refreshing. I usually judge how good a bowl of pho is by the broth, it was very flavorful and hardly oily, which is a plus since I'm already on a clean diet. The meats tasted fresh, lean, and the actual pieces themselves were more robust than your average bowl in LA. The noodles were perfectly textured and the serving size of a large was perfect. Lastly, the service was stellar. I didn't have to holler to get my glass filled with water or move plates to the side or wait long to get the check. I am definitely coming back to get the bun Bo hue and banh mi.",

    "text": "Normally on the weekends I wouldn't schlep all the way to Henderson for my Vietnamese/Pho fix unless I'm going there during the week from the office.    But on a lazy Saturday afternoon, I was extended an invitation for the official official grand opening of Pho MaiLan with 20% off the meal.  Noodle Houses are not known for ambiance but based on first impression upon arrival, the vibe inside has a fun and relaxing interior.  Me and Mr. UK David C. ordered the Large Bun Bo MaiLan (their version of Bun Bo Hue) AKA (MaiLan spicy beef and pork noodle soup). By default, MaiLan doesn't have the congealed pig blood like a traditional BBH, but I actually prefer it without it. They loaded my bowl with a decent portion of protein which I always appreciate when I eat a bowl of noodle soup.  I put in my veggies (a sprinkling of bean sprouts and they have banana blossoms which I'm sure you won't find in many shop in the US, let alone Vegas).  A nice squeeze of some lime in my eye and in the soup of course.    Hell, I even managed to forget the sting of lime juice burning my eyeball for several minutes while I devoured my bowl of deliciousness.  The broth was nice with the right amount of spiciness that is enjoyable and very flavorful. You can really tell that they use good quality ingredients and prepare everything very well.  For a busy grand opening, the service was consistent and attentive to our needs and I never had to ask them to refill my glass of water.  I will have to try the Pho Dac Biet (Combination Special) and Cha Gio (Crispy Spring Rolls) next time to really round out this review.  We may have a potential new contender for favorite Bun Bo Hue but certainly room for improvement for a future UYE or lunch visit.  It will mos def be in the my lunch rotation going forward pho shizzle!",

In short, it was awful. But I dont think it deserves a 1 star. They do serve some good hot noodle soups.  Given a choice between this resto or Saigon 8 on Eastern and 215- I would go to Saigon 8.",

So we'll go back and try something different next time.  Spring rolls... fresh and tasy.  I really like the peanut dipping sauce, very creamy.  If you like it spicy... add some chili garlic sauce to it like I did which punched it up nicely.  Chicken Pho.... quick and hot.  The broth was not oily like I've read in the other reviews so I'm wondering if maybe it's because chicken doesn't have much fat?  The Pho was good... not much to it until I added the bean sprouts, jalapenos, lime, basil and hot sauce.  Mine had lots of chicken in it so I was happy.  We each ordered a \"Regular\" and it was more than we could finish.",

Maybe I'm just not a pho guy but for what it was, I enjoyed it and had no complaints.  Go ahead and give it a try yourself!",

    "text": "I was invited here by some friends and as a lover of Vietnamese food, I couldn't resist. Pho is easily one of my favorite foods to eat, BUT I didn't have the pho, because they don't have a vegetarian/vegan broth option. Instead I had a fried tofu vermicelli bowl. It was pretty good and I ate the entire dish. The ambiance is like exactly like any other Pho restaurant and the service is good. If your a vegan, I wouldn't bother, because there are a ton of other great places offering vegetable broth. If you're a meat eater then this place might be your best bet in the Athens area.",

    "text": "It was not until I was seated with my hot plate of pho in front of me that I noticed the glaring \"C\" grade displayed in a semi conspicuous location. I havIe to admit that seeing the grade had a negative impact on my overall experience.  From the outside the place is spacious, modern and appears clean. The service is friendly and to the point. They are located up Eastern near the Anthem area. I had their No 1 combo while my husband opted for Vermecelli. The broth was fine - it was savory with a decent amount of flavor. They skimped on the meat that's for sure.  I really did not find it mind blowing enough to return after their \"C\" grade slip up. I had their pho once before and it was \"fine\" enough to return, but this was before the grade. As I mentioned before, the broth is solid but not mind blowing nor the best in town by any stretch. I think it will do well with the Anthem clientele -- just get the grade under control! Had it not been for the grade issue I would say this is a solid 3.5 joint.",

    "text": "Very disappointing. Checked their menu before visiting to make sure they had some vegetarian options. It appeared as if they had tofu rolls and a noodle option with tofu. I arrived only to discover they had no tofu and had to settle for the veggie egg rolls. I was going to leave but felt bad especially since I got lost looking for the restaurant.   The veggie egg rolls were uninspiring and had an odd sweet aftertaste to them. Something I am not used to. I understand restaurants will freeze egg rolls and cook to order but these rolls were not fresh at all. Due to the lack of tofu, they replaced the tofu In the noodle dish with more of the (to my dismay) veggie egg rolls. Everything on the menu had beef, pork, or chicken broth. Hmmmm maybe Vietnamese food is just not for vegetarians?  I am rating this restaurant two stars because the staff was pleasant and the space clean and bright BUT I will not be returning to this establishment.",

Place is simple and look like any type of Asian restaurant in China Town. Quick services . Ordered the summer spring rolls, cold noodles with stir fry beef( bun bo xao) pho special& three beans drink. Reason for 3 stars because hubby didn't like his pho much, he stated it is too bland, there was no basil  leaves to go along in the pho. Again there was no mints leaves in the cold noodles or the spring rolls . The bean wasn't soft and came with jello like strips instead of the chewy jelly kind that you usually get in a True typical Vietnamese restaurant. Meat was also a little tough but they do give you plenty",

The place is very clean and very open so you do not feel like some is sitting on your lap and listening to your conversation.. which is like what most Vietnamese Restaurants are like..  I had the same items again & the items were really good again..Egg Rolls really good.. I love the Beef Stew with Rice Noodle.. My son had Pho and said it was good..We had some items for take out ..the Grilled items on the menu really good also.. The service is really good.. friendly & fast.. price is just right..without the drive to Spring Mountain for Vietnamese food..

I came here after a hard days work but I didn't appreciate the service I received, especially after a stressful intense work day.   I came in and all the booths on the left were full. I proceeded to the bathroom to wash my hands and then tried to seat myself elsewhere. No wait staff to be found hence the fact I figured I would just seat myself. Plenty of tables were left dirty and the three booths in the other side dirty as well. I figured if I would just park it in the middle of the three Someone would clear the table for me. A man proceeds to ask me to move to another table because it was dirty I said no I'd like to sit here I'll wait so he said it would be a few minutes. He starts to clean the other tables far from me first and waits for me last. I know I could have sat somewhere else but it was cold and I was tired and I would have rather sat at a booth. When he finally gets to my table he cleans it quick and walks away. Moments later comes back drops a menu and walks away. No one has greeted me said hi, how are you? Nothing! He comes back and asks \"are you ready\" and I said \"I'll have the pho tai please\" he said ok and walked away.  Returned with water and walked away. No words being said. It's just a bit awkward. Walking away is a pretty common thing they do here at Pho Mailan. Shortly after placing my order a woman drops off my pho and walks away. Not even placing it in front of me. She places it in the middle of the table. I thought ok kind of weird but it was because she was grabbing the condiments for the pho which she dropped off again on the other side of the table and again walked away. Not even asking if I needed something else or if I'm doing ok. Nothing. I mean I didn't need anything else but it's the thought that counts. I actually did need a fork because my chopstick skills aren't the best. She smiled when I asked and brought it quickly. There was one gentlemen who asked if I was doing ok and that was much appreciated.   I'm giving two stars based on service but the pho alone could easily be a 4 star review. Very flavorful broth serves with a generous helping of both meat and noodles presented beautifully with onion, scallion and cilantro. I like to keep my broth pretty plain and add just a squirt of lemon and let the broth stand alone. In my option a good bowl of pho doesn't need much. I was enjoying my pho throughly until I found a shrimp tail at the bottom of my bowl. What if I was allergic?   Other than the sucky service this place has delicious pho and is sure to fix my pho craving when I'm need. I would still come back even though they're flat out rude. Maybe it was just an off day for them. We'll see next time.",

    "text": "The BF loves his PHO - not more than he loves me though- (let's hope) anyways, he told me that he spotted a Pho place in our area and was dieing to try it...So after weeks of saying not today I finally gave in. My first impression was that it was clean and decorated cute-it had a boutique feel to it. Which in my book was cool... On to the food-in the menu it looks like all of the Pho contains beef with the exception of one (chicken) but when we asked the nice waitress she said that for $1.00 more they can put shrimp instead of beef-Cool!!!  -Iced Tea: Be aware that it is lightly colored yellow (like pee) and has an extra light taste so light that it just about tasted like my water. The waitress said it was a green tea not black and that it was meant to be healthy and have a clean taste-the BF loved it. -Cha Gio (Crispy spring rolls): This dish is what determines for me if I want to return or not. In Guam these spring rolls are huge and full of clear noodles,tiny bits of pork and veggies and flavored with lots of black pepper-hella good, I miss it. I'm always trying to find a place that sells something similar.This dish is served with big lettuce leaves for you to wrap the egg rolls in and pickled carrots/daikon(could've been pickled longer) to add with fish sauce to dip-These were OK - I hardly saw noodles and I would like them bigger-but still yummy.. -Com Thit Nuong (Thin sliced grilled marinated pork): This dish comes with rice and cucumbers,lettuce and a sliced tomato- there is never any sauce for the salad in Vietnamese Restrauants- The pork was really yummy-it was marinated well and finger lickin good however I didn't like my rice-I am so picky with my rice and I don't like seeing the bottom of the pot in the middle of my rice-I want my rice shiny white and this scoop of rice didn't do it for me... -Pho Ga(Chicken broth): This comes with rice noodles,shredded chicken,and lots of green oinons. I liked the broth, I thought it had just the right amount of seasoning-so soothing on a cold night... -Pho Tai(with shrimp instead): The BF absolutly loves his Pho no matter where we're at-he adds his siracha sauce,limes,and basil and he's in heaven-so yes he loved this dish. I like that this location is close to home and not jammed packed so that we feel like sardines like at other Pho places. I think we will be back again....",

    "text": "I've been to Pho MaiLan several times now. It's the closest pho joint to my house, which makes it the go-to by default. Mind you, I wouldn't keep going back if it sucked, and it definitely doesn't.  The pho is decent--good quality meat, broth isn't bad, and they give you a fair portion--and the service is excellent (as long as it's one of the adults doing the servicing... the couple kids who work there definitely don't have the same customer service ethic). Definitely the friendliest of all pho places I've ever been to (although Lemongrass is a close second in that department).  I've had several of the beef pho dishes as well as a couple of the vermicelli ones, one of the new banh mi specials (pork), and their new lemongrass grilled chicken plate. I'll break it down for you:  * The sandwich had more teriyaki-type sauce on it than most I've tried (not sure what that sauce a actually is, traditionally), but was really tasty. * I'm not the hugest fan of the pho ga (chicken soup) as I find it pretty bland compared to the beef pho bowls, but that's True at pretty much any pho place I go. Oh a whim, I tried the mi van special (like the pho ga but with egg noodles instead of rice), but the noodles were super gross and it didn't have any more flavor than the pho ga. I definitely wouldn't recommend that one. * Ok, the lemongrass chicken -- well, it was definitely chicken, but it didn't taste at all of lemongrass, and seemed like it was actually covered in some sort of watery yellow curry (like the yellow curry used in Hawaiian cuisine, but waterier and with less flavor). Seemed overly salty, too, and I didn't bother eating my leftovers later. Oh well.  Above varying food reviews aside, I'll still keep coming back for the friendly service & the decent beef pho. They're also always happy to give me extra scallions & onions, which makes my tastebuds happy!",

    "text": "WILL NEVER come back here considering there are a couple of other better Vietnamese restaurants around the area.   I ordered to go and got: Beef wrapped in betel leaf appetizer Vermicelli with grilled pork  So I went to go pick it up and asked for an extra anchovy sauce that should come with the beef wraps. I've had this from other places and it usually comes with anchovy sauce AND on their menu it states \"served with anchovy sauce\". The employee (super nice btw) had no idea what I was talking about and said she would go and ask. Another employee came and asked me to elaborate. He then went back in the kitchen then came out and told me they were preparing it. I stood there a couple mins and the first employee came back and said let me check on it for you. Then I heard a voice from the back saying, \"no there's no anchovy sauce. We don't have anchovy sauce. There's nothing. I don't know.\" So I figured okay they don't have it, whatever it's fine. But then the second employee walks out and hands me a container of some sauce. I ask if that's really anchovy sauce and he says yes. Really? You're going to lie to me? At that point I just grabbed my food and left.   Reason for 1 stars: 1. Don't lie to me. If you don't have it then just tell me that. Don't try to give me something else and try to pull a fast one on me. What if I was allergic to something in that sauce? Not cool 2. Vermicelli was decent. BEEF WRAPS WERE NOT EVEN COOKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH. They pretty much gave me raw meat. The only part that was cooked was the outside. Completely pink on the inside. That is definitely not how it should be served. I was so disgusted. That's a health hazard. If you can't make a dish right then TAKE IT OFF OF YOUR MENU!!! It's that simple.   I would give this place ZERO stars if I could. I'll pass on this place. Definitely not my go-to Vietnamese restaurant.",

    "text": "We first tried this place when it opened a couple of years back and hadnt been back until tonight. We were contemplating picking up from Pho Saigon 8 but thought why not get from closer to home (about 5 minutes)? I have to say, very glad we gave this place a second chance.    Had 2 large orders of pho tai (rare steak) 8.00 each and an order of springs rolls (fried egg rolls) 6.00 for 4 rolls. I have to say the amount of noodles and beef was way more than my husband and I could finish! I am a very hearty eater by the way...Our large bowls at home were about to overflow with all the food and I actually didnt eat all of the noodles. Each of us had about 12 pieces of steak, which is generous.   The broth was still boiling hot and when we poured it over the beef and noodles, the meat cooked instantly. The soup was flavorful, not overly oily and really hit the spot. the spring rolls were average, no worse or better than other pho places we've tried. It does seem though maybe take out is the way to go!   The only downside was the green leaf lettuce that you wrap the spring rolls in was a little wilted and brown along the edges. Had they been really fresh, it would have almost been 5 stars. We will order from them again!",

The Pho wasn't BAD, just wasn't.. good. I got the flank steak and it seemed to be lacking in the soup:[. The noodles were also different and not the regular vermicelli that I am used to. Sadly the noodles were also lacking in the substance department.. are they trying to go against the grain with their different noodles?? I don't know. But I prefer the standard.   I was left with a big bowl of beef broth that wasn't all too yummy and my Pho craving wasn't all too satisfied.   To return? Yes... just not for Pho.",

Even a good place to do large groups. We ordered:  - meatball pho - nice and clear broth. we're so used to the LA pho thats laden with fat on top and MSG. LOL. I actually didn't taste the meatballs but the bf said he really liked it a lot  - pho with crispy flank and marbled brisket (#7 i think?) - i looove the texture the flank! it was chewy and crunchy and so good. you will like it if you like cartilage-y stuff. the marbled brisket was delicious too. they also give you a good amount of meat in there  - spicy noodle (their special) - this comes with the bigger rice noodles. the broth may look scary and spicy but it actually wasnt spicy at all (for me). it had pieces of lemongrass, galanga and other spices in there. very very tasty! and also, lots of meat in it  - pork chop on rice - came with two big pieces of pork cooked perfectly  Overall, very good!! I love the selection, especially all the different types of meat you can get in your pho. Plus they have banh mi, rice dishes, and other things I wanna try. We will return!",

It is very nice and clean. They have booths as well as tables. The service was very good and always made sure to fill waters and check if everything was good.  I do feel the the menu does lack some variety. No banh mi, so boyfriend ordered pho instead. I got the rare steak and tendon (as usual!)  and they gave a good amount of beef and tendon. The beef was nice and soft and the tendon was melt in your mouth with a couple exceptions for some chewy peices. I did find the broth to be a little more sour/too citrusy  than I'd like. But besides that it had a nice flavor.   Prices are not too bad either at $6.50 for a small and $7.50 for a large. They did give 20% off our bill for the grand opening.   Personally, Lemongrass is still my favorite in the area but Pho MaiLan is definitely a good alternative as well. More than I can say for Pho Saigon 8, and Pho Little Saigon. Will definitely return in the future.. I wanted to try to bun bo hue that the previous reviewers tried! I saw it.. but decided to go with my normal pho!",

    "text": "I used to love this place and it has been my go-to Vietnamese restaurant until yesterday. We went here for lunch and saw their specials on the chalkboard. When we sat down and the waitress came to take order, I asked her what was the sauce that came with it. She said fish sauce. I was looking for a bit more clarification, as they have different kinds of sauce and at the time I couldn't be sure if she meant the sauce that goes with the vermicelli dishes or not. She just seemed like she didn't understand my question, and seemed quite impatient. I then decided that I'd get the \"egg roll vermicelli\" instead. Again, she did not understand what I ordered, turned the menu to the other page (without even saying \"excuse me\") and pointed at the egg roll appetizer asking \"you want this one?\" I said \"no, I wanted vermicelli with egg rolls\" and tried to turn back to the vermicelli page to find the entry. She then demanded \"just give me the number, ok?\" with a annoyed attitude. I was shocked. I asked, \"wow, did you have a bad day?\" And all she said was \"just give me the number\". Seriously, I can understand that you've had a hard day, but I did not ask for anything special or make your job extra hard. All I wanted to know was a bit more detail on a dish, and then ordered what was on the menu. If you can't remember what's on the menu, that's your bad and not mine, why would you take it on me? I wouldn't mind clarifying it if you asked politely.   I loved this place because, first of all, the service was better than many Vietnamese/Asian restaurants, and second of all, the food was good. But yesterday just left a bitter taste in me that even the food can't bring me back...",

I love taro in my eggrolls, I even add it when I make them at home, but I don't like it when it is thick and chunky where I can pull pieces of it from my eggroll.

Last time they ran out of broth at a soup restaurant. The only reason they have reviews is because they are the only pho restaurant in 10 mile radius of the next one on eastern. This place has nothing special about it and is mediocre at best. Their monopoly on noodles with soup is nothing to be excited about. Actually I think the reason why they put up all their chairs an hour earlier is because something happened to to their business and thus needed to close early to save money. Eat here if you haven't eaten in a couple days and desperate. The two star is for the staff that is nice most of the time.",

The food tastes very good. I would say they are above average in terms of taste. You definitely get good value for your money.  Overall, if you're in the mood for some pho or other Vietnamese-styled food, this place will make you happy. If I could give this place a 4.5, I would.",

I always love coming during the afternoon as it never is super busy around that time. There will be about only 3 other parties in there and it is pretty spacious compared to other pho places. The servers are friendly and quick to bring the food out. I love the waitress who leaves a pitcher of water at our table so we can refill our cups whenever.   My favorite starter to get is the spring rolls, they are nice and fresh but won't fill you up just in time for the pho. I always get P2 as I don't get too extravagant with my pho, the broth is the star in my opinion.   I always end up craving Pho MaiLan's pho more than any other place. Definitely a forever favorite.",

This place deserves a great review. I met the owner Eric and told him how much I enjoyed the food there,  he was very kind. I'm so glad I decided to try this restaurant out. I am confident you all will be very pleased too. The owner cares about his food and takes pride in his business, so please support him and treat yourself to some great vietnamese cuisine.",

I am not craving for water so you know there is no MSG in their broths. All of their broths have a great lemongrass taste to it. Service was good and the place itself was overall clean. The place is rather big so there are a lot spots to sit at. They have tons of condiments to flavor your food, but you don't really need to flavor the food because it is already flavorful! They have a great selection of pho and I would really reccomend P6. The meat they have is tasty and does not have much fat. I would definitely come back here again!",

We usually start off with some summer rolls, and order a large bowl of pho (noodle soup) with brisket and tendon. The beef short ribs / kalbi are super good, too! Also, the bahn mi pork sandwich... Mmm, yea.   Anyway, before you head out try the che thai, it's a sweet dessert. Coconut milk, crushed ice, lychee, jack fruit, and maybe something else I'm missing. I hate to leave without ordering it.   I noticed they won an award for the best Vietnamese Restaurant from... I don't know LV Weekly or LV RJ, Yelp! maybe? My point is, I'm glad they got the recognition they deserve :)  Thanks so much for all the great food!",

Needless to say, since it was frozen it didn't cook in the hot broth, it instead just made my broth cold. I had to heat it up on my stove in order for it to be edible. I guess when you call in an order for pick up, make sure you specify you don't want your meat frozen. I have it 2 stars instead of 1, because despite the frozen meat, after heating properly and eating the broth was very good.",

The service used to be so much better but now I have to flag the waitresses and employees down to ask for a refill of water, the check, silverware etc. It's like after they got voted \"Best Vietnamese food in Las Vegas\" they stopped giving a f@$k. Ever since I think it was the manager guy with the hoop earrings left its just been on a steady downward slope.  Today I literally had to get up and stand there and wave for someone to come to our table. I also asked our waitress to split the check between my friend while we placed our order but she still brought one check, after I addressed it, there were excuses instead of an apology which was disappointing. Pho MaiLan your food is delicious but you all need to work on customer service. We've been coming faithfully to MaiLan since it opened but after today I think I'm done. The service there used to be UH-mazing and it shocks me that it declined so rapidly. There are so many delicious pho spots in Vegas I'm sure we won't have an issue finding another favorite.

    "text": "Sometimes you wander around on Yelp and you stumble across hidden gems in your own neighborhood, this is the case with me and Pho MaiLan.  If not for Yelp, I would never know about it even though it's just half a block from my favorite Trader Joe's.  I see a lot of potential in Pho MaiLan, mostly due of their Bun Bo Hue, the Vietnamese spicy beef noodle soup, the less known cousin of Pho but definitely the more fitting noodle soup for cold weather.  It's made with a richer beef broth with a subtle hint of lemongrass flavor, a more hearty rice vermicelli, and filling proteins such as beef shank, pork hock, beef tendon & pork blood.  It's a favorite among Vietnamese but difficult to make well, and thus I haven't had a very good bowl since moving to Vegas from Orange County.  Pho MaiLan's version is very tasty without being too fatty, something that I've rarely found in Vegas.  I'm giving it a three stars only because tonight's bowl was missing a couple of things to be authentic: there was no pork blood; also, banana blossom and shredded cabbage should be served as the accompanying veggies but they ran out of banana blossom this evening.    My fiance had Pho, it was good, not the best Pho broth in Vegas but it had a good amount of meat and the beef's quality was very good.  We also had egg rolls for appetizers.  The egg rolls were good; however, I was disappointed because I read from Yelp that the restaurant had Banh Beo (floating rice cakes with shrimp) but they also ran out of that tonight.    On a positive note, the service is great, the waitresses were very friendly and attentive.  The restaurant's atmosphere is cheery and clean (all the sauce bottles seem to be filled and cleaned often).  The Bun Bo is still the best one in Vegas so far for me, but I'm looking forward to a more complete version next time.",

Today I called and ordered two types of banh mi sandwiches for take-out. I specified no jalapenos and had them repeat it back to me on the phone. When I drove over to pick up the sandwiches, the young woman who gave me our order said it was two banh mi with no jalapenos. - Guess what? Got the banh min home and opened them, and they both were loaded with jalapenos. I called to complain and they said to drive back and make an exchange, but I was not up for the round trip. I told them I would visit soon and expect either a full refund or two properly prepared banh mi. We tossed out the ones they gave me because even when the jalapenos are removed, the pepper oils still permeate the sandwich. - Very disappointing, and I will tell you this is not the first time that a menu item we've ordered, even dining in, was not the item that was delivered. You may think I am a chronic complainer, but I am not. It's just that this was the proverbial straw that ...etc, etc.",

It almost tastes like its just beef broth with no Pho spices!!! In fact I think the broth is not authentic at all it does taste like its can beef broth.  I was hoping it was good because they are right across the street from me and sometimes i'm just too lazy and tired to spend 8 hours making my own Pho, but I was very disappointed. Not to mention the seafood pho is majorly lacking in good quality squid and the scallops are a joke their pea sized!!! why even put it in there then?! if I want good Pho I have to drive down to Pho Saigon 8 over in the Chuck E Cheese complex. In addition this place is majorly over priced!!! I have never had to pay $10 for Pho and its not even good!!! That's ridiculous!!! this place is way to over priced. Driving down to Pho Saigon 8 will save you almost $3 per person!!! yeah I have to say the price is just way over the top for being a simple Vietnamese place. If you are familiar with Vietnamese food the ingredients are not expensive at all. I will not be coming back here, I will make the small extra drive to save money and have better Pho.",

The waiters are very nice and they check up on you to see if you're enjoying your food & if you need anything else, but they're not all over your shoulder and checking up every second. The prices are very good & for five people, our total was only $30! Being a vegan, I only got their Tofu Summer Rolls - but they were so yummy! I also got the Young Coconut Drink, and it was sooo delicious, and they kept it in the actual coconut! And then after I was done drinking it, they cut it in half so I could eat the actual coconut. My family loved the Pho and said it was the best they ever had. The restaurant isn't crowded, and everything is clean and on point. For anyone in the area, I definitely recommend it! :)",

I didn't really like it. Even though it was spicy (and I like spicy), I thought it was kind of plain and very oily, most of the meat pieces in the soup were fat and there weren't enough noodles for me. I did try the regular beef noodle pho, which was okay, but different than what I usually expect. Then again, I'm a die-hard Pho Kim Long fan.   On the other hand, the service was great. The server was very nice and when my mom said that her drink tasted like diet, the server brought out another Pepsi for her to drink right away. I ordered the thai tea too, but like Melissa N. said in the other review... it was kind of different and not really the best thai tea out there.   Anyway, I'll probably go back with my boyfriend and order something different. My mom said the pork chops were really good, and she finished those. I just won't order the spicy soup again.",

I downed my Thai Tea and drank like 3 glasses of water.   As for atmosphere, very casual.  The restaurant is quite open and clean.  It has a calming effect.  We didn't care too much for the pictures ~ for some reason, they have a cyclist picture in an Asian restaurant.  Figure that they would have more of an Asian theme.  But, really, we weren't there for the pictures.   As for the service, it is a family run operation and they really take care of you.  And, yes, thank god, they actually talk to you and ask you how was your experience.  Customer Service is something that is usually lacking in a lot of Viet restaurant (i.e. Pho Saigon 8 - yuck).

The meat was well seasoned but a bit chewy. However, the lettuce, bean sprouts, and cucumbers they put inside were green and fresh. We also ordered chicken wings that were served with a sweet chili sauce. They put pepper in their flour batter that gave it a kick. They give you 20% off your whole menu as part of a promo they are running. Definitely take advantage of the promo! Other than the food that made me give them 3 stars, they had this asian sound clip that was about 20 seconds long that kept replaying, and it was loud too!

    "text": "Normally, Pho in an upscale area is a rare occurrence. Then add the fact that the place is bright, spotless, and got an A grade by the health department makes it almost unreal for a Vietnamese restaurant. By no means am I criticizing the businesses of my people, but most of the places I use to frequent in LA were C grade.  Pho MaiLan is a breathe of fresh air. The open feel and spread out dining area is a welcoming touch.   To start my friend and I got an order of spring rolls ($4.95). They were two fat rolls filled with lettuce, mint, noodles, boiled pork, and shrimp. It was nice to bite into them and not come out with a mouthful of noodles. The peanut sauce comes with pickled daikon and carrots. It tastes even better with a spoonful of the chili sauce.   Instead of getting Pho, I saw that they had a vermicelli rice noodle bowl filled with all my favorites. The Bun MaiLan Dac Biet ($8.50) was the perfect way to try a little of everything. The lemongrass pork was tender, flavorful, and plenty. If that was not enough, there was an eggroll, two pieces of grilled meat, a couple of shrimp, a mound of lettuce, mint leaves, and more pickled vegetables. It comes with a side bowl of Nuoc Mam. Spoon some over the whole dish, mix up, and it is a meal only a notch under my mom's level. Everyone is biased towards what we grow up with. My only complaint was that the meats were more on the salty side. My friend took a bite of it and said that he might forgo getting the Pho Dac Biet ( Regular $6.95) one day and order this instead. That in itself is an amazing feat, because he will spend a whole day hanging out at the house when my dad makes Pho and eat 4 bowls before the day end.  We also got a Banh Mi Thit Nuong to go for a friend. The meat came in a generous portion. It kept it's warm and tenderness for quite some time. The lean meat and filling were good, but the bread needs more of a crunch. It was too doughy for my taste. It is more expensive than most places costing around $5, but the meat alone is worth it.",

We settled on large bowls of Pho beef noodle soup.  If you want vegetables in your soup then you have to request an \"add on\" (additional $2.50 charge) so we ordered one extra veggie bowl on the side and 2 of us were able to share it.  We found the soup to be very flavorful and filling!  Don't drink all the broth if you need to watch your sodium intake!  The staff provided good service and were attentive. We will absolutely come back and try other items!  :-))",

    "text": "Came here last week.  The food was good, I don't have any complaints about it but my wife is Vietnamese and so has very high standards as to her critiques.  So it wasn't mind-blowing Pho so thats why only 3 stars.  However what is worthy of noting is the great service we experienced when we were here.  Unfortunately we sat in a booth that was neighboring two girls who were seated behind my wife.  These girls were absolutely disgusting: they were burping loudly, singing loudly (horribly), throwing stuff at each other, and just being completely rude, childish, and disruptive.  At one point water starts dripping down the booth almost getting my wife's clothes wet.  The manager happened to be there and I pointed to it and he looked up as if it was the ceiling leaking, I told him where the source was from though: the girls.  He very politely asked them to stop throwing spit balls (yup, they were shooting spit balls at each other and throwing ice cubes), and they were very rude to him saying \"what? what?\" Then my wife got up turned around and told them to knock the shit off.  To our surprise they weren't 15 year old girls but two 26 year olds, one of whom was wearing scrubs (geeze I hope she's not an actual nurse)  He apologized and apologized to us like 5 times, which was awesome but we wish they would have apologized to him.  Anyways they left him a nasty note and we left him a good tip.  But that attitude you just rarely see: the one where the manager is ensuring the experience for all his guests is a good one, with total disregard to whether or not it is his fault or the fault of others.  This guy deserves a raise, he is a great worker here.  And for that I have upped my review to 4 stars.",

Ordered soup first and appetizer but felt too rushed. Finally, some of the main meal arrived except mine. Waited and waited and finally asked the waiter who said I didn't order but 3 main meal. Told him to forget about it. I lost my appetite after waiting for a while. Then few minutes later the waiter came back and said here is your order who told me a few mins ago that I didn't have an order. I am tired of going to Vietnamese restaurants who has little or no customer care at all. Will never go back nor recommend this place.    Ester",

    "text": "For starters....  WHAT THE #@*! HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE?!?!  Our overall experience with this restaurant yesterday was extremely disappointing, especially considering that not long ago (3 months?) it used to be one of our favorites.  And I don't believe they just had a random \"bad evening\".  First off, the young girl that started off with our table seemed completely lost.  How about some place settings?  How about some menus BEFORE asking what we wanted to order?  Considering we were all drinkers, how about taking a drink order?  Nope, she was just a little robot with zero common sense, zero waitressing skills, and apparently zero interest in doing anything because we never saw her again.  Oh well.  At least the food will be good right?  WRONG!  After awkwardly serving ONE PERSON AT A TIME over a 15-minute period, we finally had our food.  The spring rolls were different than the previous visit and very mediocre.  The vermicelli bowl was barely lukewarm accompanied by very cold soggy lettuce and cold water in the bottom of the bowl.  The vermicelli sauce had changed from our previous visit as well.  It was all edible, but crappy.  I'm giving it one star due to lousy service combined with food that was \"edible\" at best.  Nobody else in my party was very impressed either.  Supposedly it won a \"Best in Las Vegas\" award for 2015, but trust me, it will not be winning that award again.  Like I said before, it used to be our favorite.  But after yesterday, I will tell people to avoid it.  There are plenty of other Vietnamese restaurants in this town that blow this one away.",

And I'm Vietnamese so I know what the dishes are supposed to be like.   I travel to this area for work regularly so I was excited to try out this Vietnamese resaturant.  The first time I went there, I ordered Pho Ga and it was pretty good. The broth was a little bland, but I added some hoison sauce for flavor. Not the best assortment of herbs were provided, but I think this is catering to the American customers. The second time I went there I ordered bun (rice vermicelli) with egg rolls and grilled pork. That was the worst I've ever had. The egg rolls didn't resemble anything close to Vietnamese style egg rolls, the filling was strange and the egg rolls were burned. The grilled pork was not grilled crispy and extremely salty. The chili garlic fish sauce was not in the least close to what it should be. So I guess if you're just looking for pho, it's not bad, but my experience ordering something other than pho was not good.    On a positive note, the good parts: the wait staff was very friendly and attentive, clean and nice atmosphere.   Overall, if I go back I'll only order pho, but I'm definitely going to try other Vietnamese places when I'm back for business travel.",

When she left Vegas she made me promise to bring her back on her next visit, which I will gladly do.   This time around I tried the beef fried rice. Not what I was expecting, in a good way.  Enormous amounts of thinly sliced marinated beef atop a bed of rice. Mom had the rare beef Pho. Portions were just right.   btw...for those reviews based on a take away order...Pho is best eaten immediately when served, not in a take away order. Its a hot broth soup & meant to be eaten hot...not the next day or 20 minutes after you pick it up & get home.",

This is a Vietnamese noodle house.  I ordered the pork with vermicelli and it came with the noodles.  The portions are pretty big it filled me up pretty quickly.  The pork and the noodles were awesome! The pork was marinated to perfection and it was not chewy or tough. It was just perfect along with the vermicelli. The noodles were nice and fresh along with the veggies that came with it. You can tell everything was just cooked and not sitting in the fridge for a long time.  I also ordered the fresh Vietnamese roll. That too was really good. Inside the fresh wrapped were veggies and vermicelli. You dip the rolls into this peanut butter base type sauce, which is mmmm mmmmm gooood!  Overall:  The service is great they filled your water up and did not have to be told.  They have free Wifi so if you wanted to get some work done you can.  This place is nice and quiet , really relaxing, different from those loud Pho places.  I highly recommend this place. This is a must try.   This goes on my top list of Vietnamese places to eat.",

In any case, their other food was bomb! On their rice vermicelli menu, Bun Dac Biet (B1) was a total meat fiesta with savory grilled marinated shrimp, pork sausage, and sliced pork and a fried egg roll that seemed like a bonus! Then their Banh Mi Bo Nuong (BM3) with grilled marinated beef brightened with carrot/daikon slaw and cilantro on a bun was so good I didn't want to share! Then my whole fam really enjoyed their Com Ga Nuong (C7)- fried rice full of little veggies topped with super juicy grilled marinated chicken.   From start to finish, service was amazing! In fact, we forgot our doggie bag and our server came out in scorching 110-degree weather to find us in the parking lot. Get your Vietnom-nom on!",

Very friendly workers all throughout the restaurant.  For appetizers we got the fried calamari, which were all rings and not the legs. My favorite! Served with a sweet chili sauce for dipping. We had no problem finishing that.   I got a small vegetable pho, the veggies included were tofu, broccoli and carrots. Bean sprouts & basil served on the side. The small portion was just right for me, I finished everything in my bowl except for some soup.   I also got to try the special spicy pho. I liked the spice level and the only thing different was the noodles. It was a little more thick than the one in the pho, but noodles are noodles in my opinion.  Thank you to the staff for being so friendly & accommodating on our first visit here. Definitely be back to try something new.",

The door was open so we went in and discovered we were coming in from the back door.  LOL.  We were quickly greeted and seated.  Ordered the chicken and shrimp vermicelli noodles (bun) and a pork combo banh mi.  Food came quick and smelled great.  Had 3 good size shrimp grilled to perfection.  The bun was good along with the grilled chicken breast.  Hubby thought his banh mi was a bit salty but ate it nevertheless.  Lots of customers were getting the pho.  The pho comes in regular and large size.  The bowls looked huge.  The servers do not smile but I didn't care as the food made up for it.  Clean place and reasonable prices.  After a long hiatus, it was time to get some bun and a banh mi.  We are visiting Vegas and getting our fill of Asian cuisine.  Greeted and seated immediately.  The server also came to take our order immediately but we hadn't even opened the menu!  Our waters came while we reviewed the menu.  We ordered the chicken and egg roll bun and the combo banh mi (Marinated Grilled pork and beef, and steamed pork).  Service was quick and our food arrived.  We both enjoyed our meals although hubby said the meats were rather salty and the banh mi could have included more daikon and carrots.  Very clean environment.  We'll come back.",

I am in love with this restaurant, I just wish only two things, one you would adjust your prices for vegetarian food items and meat items, no way I should be charged the same for a Summer Roll that has zero meat in it compared to the ones that have all kinds of meat in it, makes no since and then second open a location in Henderson!! I need you everyday!  Pho Malin, you are amazing, your Pho is one of the best. I placed my order to go and they gave me the best amount of sides I have received from any Pho location, the to go box came with a large amount of chicken and broth only thing I was unsure of was did they not give me enough noodles or did I eat them all too fast? The amount of  broth  remaining was crazy! Love me some Pho with Lime! And Mint and Soy Sauce.. yummmm.. I will be back tomorrow!  Priced at about $10 for the Pho And $6.50 for the Fresh Summer Roll Veggie style .. since they charge the same with meat I always ask for my shrimp on the side!!

We've been living in Henderson for over a year now and I can't believe I've never been here.(sad)  Pho MaiLan is located In a small strip mall right on the corner of Eastern Avenue and Sunridge Heights Parkway right next to Lee's liquor and I drive past this place every single day.   We walked in at about 2:30pm (on a Wednesday) & we were greeted right at the door, shown to our table and handed a menu each, Our glasses of Water were then brought out and we ordered.  Love the prompt service!!  And with a smile!! (Very friendly)  I ordered the regular (P15) Pho Ga which is a healthy and super duper flavorful chicken broth with rice noodles accompanied by a side plate of Thai basil, bamboo shoots, lime and sliced peppers.   Add all that with a splash of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce and my mouth was in heaven!   I always dig in and drink half the soup and then eat the chicken and noodles with veggies... kid habit I guess.  The regular is a decent portion and I couldn't even finish it - so I asked for a \"to go\" container to take it home.. I didn't want to waste my Pho Ga!  So portions are awesome! I did wonder what the Large looked like.... maybe next time!  Yummy food at a great price!  Regular is $8 Large is $9  What a cheap and healthy lunch!!!  I will be back for sure and would recommend you check this ONO place out!!   Ps. Tuesday's Senior day: 10% off  Pps. HAPPY HOUR DAILY 3-5pm - Dine in only -  Appetizers and soup for only $5!!!",

Both of us went for Vermicilli Bowls. Mine had shrimp, sausage, pork, and egg rolls. His had sausage and egg rolls. They were both large portions full of meat, noodles, and vegetables. The flavors in the bowl were great. I liked the sauces on the table to help add more flavor and heat to the dishes. Pricing was very reasonable.",

We didn't have much time so we tried to rush the whole process.   We ordered everything in one go. 4 appetizers (3 rolls and shrimp skewer), pho for friends and the usual vermicelli for me.   The regular spring roll was decent, but the pork belly one was bananas. Had we had a little extra time I would've ordered another one for myself. It was so good.   The bbq beef vermicelli I had was hands down THE best I've had. Meat wise anyway. That was perfectly cooked and flavored  The service was also fantastic. I'm used to getting shitty service at Asian establishments since it's typically the norm. This place was a different story. They were attentive and on it.   I",

I came across Pho MaiLan. The broth is very good, not as much basil as I like to be served but the waiters were very nice and brought extra. I always order Meatball Pho with extra meatballs. If you cannot let your broth and meatballs stand alone then you don't have good pho. The meatballs are very well balanced and had a great texture. I love it when I order extra and I get extra! They pass my test and made my husband feel very good. To top it off they serve Three Color Bean Dessert, if you have never had this, it is a great culinary experience. It consists of a white bean sweetened with condensed milk, a sweet red bean, and a rice jelly of some kind, usually green and cut into strips with a wavy slicer. Layered like a trifle and topped with coconut milk and shaved ice. It is spectacular and so refreshing and fun to eat. They make a very good one here. I recommend trying it if you feel adventurous.",

It is located in a strip mall on the west side of the road just south of Coronado and Lees discount liquors.  There is a special on Chicken Pho Bowls currently, small is $5.99 and a large is $6.99.  I was greeted at the door by a female employee washing the windows and Then promptly seated by a male employee.    I ordered summer rolls to start, as that is a personal favorite of mine.  I also ordered the small chicken Pho bowl.    The summer rolls were delivered quickly with a small bowl of peanut sauce.  The summer rolls were fresh, and there was an abundance of shrimp inside.  The thick peanut sauce was very tasty and complemented the summer rolls quite nicely.  Overall, a great way to start the meal.  Next came the special chicken pho bowl.  It was delivered piping hot with a side of greens, bean sprouts,  jalapeno slices and lime wedges.  The broth was reminiscent of Miso broth, and it was delicious.  The Chicken was tender with the exception of one piece that was slightly rubbery and tough.  Overall however; a delicious bowl of pho.    The decor is very nice and there is ample table seating inside the dining area. The wait staff was prompt, however after 3 visits to the table the water was never refilled.  After I paid the check, the female employee that I first encountered offered more water, however I was done and needed to leave.   Overall the food was good and the service was good.  I will dine here again and try sone of the other menu items at a later date.  I left with a full belly, and felt I had received a good deal on my dining purchase.",

The small to large size is a nominal fee for more noodles,  more meat and broth. My only complaint is they tend to skimp on the basil. I give the pho 4 stars.    For a change,  I ordered a banh mi sandwich for lunch. I got this sorry excuse of 2 thin meats,  haphazardly placed pickled daikon and carrots, with chewy bread. Lucky their pho is good, so we keep coming back. Unfortunately, we're afraid to order anything else- 1 star.",

    "text": "I've been on a veggie pho kick lately and have been seeking the place that serves it up best in Vegas. I usually love Pho Mailan's broth when served with the combo (beef, brisket, tripe, etc.).  For some reason though the beef broth is far too \"heavy\" for the vegetable pho. It overpowers in a bad way, and yet it's also quite bland as well. I had to dump sriracha into the pho even after adding the accoutrements (lime, basil, etc.).   Additionally, they use soft tofu when a fried skin tofu would taste much better texture wise. It's just harder to eat and doesn't add any flavor to the soup.The vegetables were ok.  A good veggie pho should feel light and healthy. This left me feeling tired and sluggish. It just didn't sit well with me.  I'm not certain why though.  I really do like pho Mailan, but their food is hit or miss. I recommend the pho beef combo or their pork and omelet with rice dish. They do those well. I do not recommend the vegetable pho.",

With this place being so conveniently close to where I stay, I can breath knowing that such a yummy Pho place is so close!   After a night of heavy drinking, like many of us- I was craving a big bowl of delicious Pho! After reviewing Yelp Pho MaiLan popped up with 4 Stars out of almost 500 reviews, so I said why not.   When we arrived in around 1130a there were a handful of patrons. The interior is spacious, clean and welcoming. We were greeted with smiles and were seated right away. Our server was kind enough to review the menu, but my stomach already knew what it wanted to be filled with.  I ordered the Combination Pho. There are over 5 different types of meat to choose from and for my soup I chose and highly recommend the MARBLE brisket, round steak, regular brisket and tendon! The marble brisket was fantastic, I like my meat to have a small amount of fat, this is where you get the flavor! && the broth?! SO good and when I added jalapenos, lime juice and chili paste- It was full speed ahead, on my way to curing my hangover!   My bowl was so big, I went home with leftovers, score!",

It was pretty empty when we arrived. Our server came up to us immediately greeted us with a couple of waters and gave us time to check out the menu.  Started out with the fried shrimp and the veggie spring rolls.  Shrimp is a solid 4/5. It's just typical tempura battered shrimp. But still pretty fresh very crispy and not oily at all.  Spring rolls on the other hand were a 3/5. Not much on the flavor side and heavy on the oil.  Next we had the veggie pho and the bahn mi.  So the soup was pretty bland. Actually came out Luke warm. We would've sent it back but the waiter took a while to come back and check on us. Veggies were over cooked and mushy. The actual broth was very bland.  Lastly was the bahn mi. It was just ok 3/5. The meat wasn't seasoned well and the jalapenos that were placed on there were so spicy it ruined the flavor. The roll was way too thick for the amount of meet and veggies.  Overall it was ok. Nothing amazing. Probably won't be back.",

So my husband and I were anxious to satisfy the buds.   The restaurant was clean and very nice. Casual wear was and is acceptable. The service was very good. Young staff but helpful with the menu as it was in Korean and the smaller print was in English. Which was entirely acceptable.   I ordered seafood rice noodles with Bok Choy   They charged me an extra $2'for the Bok Choy. My husband ordered Mi Xao Dion translation seafood with crispy noodles.  We suspect the crab in his dinner was imitation crab. He very much dislikes warm imitation crab. Otherwise, he liked his meal. My dinner was perfect. A little disappointed in the Bok Choy fee but yes a definite repeat.  We ordered a large saki and two summer rolls. They were filled with greens galore. Loved them.

Prices are about right compared to other places. However - be warned, we were at table of 4 adults and 2 small children and they automatically tacked on 18% gratuity.  Not a big deal but just be forewarned as it might catch some people by surprise.  Pho broth was good, seasoning just right. I did notice that even though we ordered the pho with the well done beef, it still came out super red. Not a big deal because the broth is piping hot and if you mix it to the bottom of the bowl right away it will cook itself no problem.  The fresh spring roll presentation was kinda cool - it had the leaf part of the lettuce sticking out the side.",

We used to always come in the morning (usually after we got off work at 10am). If it wasn't a to go order, we would dine in. I know a month or so ago they had a sign posted on their door, I never got the chance to read it, but the restaurant was opened a few days later. The staff that worked there before the note was posted was always so friendly and kind! They were very knowledgeable and always knew what my orders were going to be. Well after the note was posted, my girlfriend and I were craving pho so we went around dinner time. We didn't recognize the people working, but figured maybe it was just the night shift. Well we sat down and waited for someone to take our order, finally after 15 mins a girl came over to take our drink orders. But since we had to wait, we already knew what we wanted so we just ordered it. Our food and drinks came out pretty fast. The drinks didn't taste the way they used to, something was missing but we couldn't put a finger on what though. During the whole time we were there, not one person came by to check on us, not even the girl that took our order. We literally just sat there. There were a few other people in there dining and it seemed that they were being helped but not us. Finally I had to grab someone just to get the check, and even then it took a while to get the check and wait for my debit card.   I loved this place a lot, but after this last time I don't think I can give it another chance. Maybe in another year or so, but at this moment I was very disappointed in the service and the food.",

So oily that even my 5 year old daughter would not eat it.... Which also in my opinion wasn't very tasty either. Also... The noodles were already MUSH by the time we got them... Needless to say.. We are never going back again... We are Lemongrass Cafe lovers! We go once a week! Sorry Pho Mailan!",

    "text": "I've been trying to decide whether to give this place four or five stars and it's a pretty close call. Last night was my first time at Pho Mailan as I'm new to the area. My first impression was a good one; clean, airy, comfortable atmosphere. Service was quick and I had nothing to complain about. There also seemed to be a lot of regulars which is always a good sign. The broth was fragrant and light, and was topped with plenty of greens and vegetables which I love. Pho is one of my favorite things ever, so I've had quite a bit in my day. I like to feel good about myself when I eat Pho, so I'm bummed when I get broth that is dark and oily and I feel disgusting afterwards. This had none of those qualities so I am assuming they don't use MSG, can't swear to it since I'm not an expert, but I felt nothing but happy about having a belly full of hot soup. My only complaint is that they only have two sizes for Pho... I would be thrilled to see an extra large on the menu. I also didn't see an \"extras\" section on the menu where you can double up on meat, get add on's etc., but I will definitely be asking the next time I go for Pho because I'll be back for sure.",

I've lost count how many times I've been here to satisfy my pho cravings, but I swear it got better with each and every visit. The combination bowl is worth every penny. There are two sizes available, regular and large. Unlike many other places, when you order a larger bowl, they don't just fill it with more broth. Pho Mailan fills it with more meat, noodles, and everything else to make the $1 difference completely worth it.   Their appetizers are a bit on the pricier side ($6 for an order of spring rolls is a bit expensive), and that automatically docks one star from my review. But nonetheless, the food is great, the owners are very polite and courteous, and I can guarantee you won't leave dissatisfied.",

    "text": "Was craving Pho, why is Henderson so void of such joints? Anyway, drove out from the southeast side in some pretty hideous traffic and we were both pretty crabby by the time we got there. They totally made up for it by being fabulous.  It's a strip mall restaurant, but not small. Clean, well lit, with nicely modern decor. Eclectic music (from Vietnamese romantic singing to Frank Sinatra to what sounded like French chipmunks - haven't decided if that's a plus or minus). The waitstaff was friendly and efficient. Prices on par. Plenty of selection in and out of Pho.  We ordered Vietnamese coffee and spring rolls. Both safe, both yummy. On to more complex.  I went ahead with the \"famous\" spicy soup - seasoned beef broth, rice noodles, flank steak, tripe, tendons, and that weird spam-like beef substance that these things come with. Got my plate of sprouts, cabbage, jalapenos, and limes nice and early. When the soup came out, my first sip of broth was pure heaven. It made Jim cry & chug water, which means it was spicy enough for me, but not overdone.  Jim got a chicken satay. Perfectly marinated. I got a bite, but that's all he'd offer, lol.  I did have to ask for cilantro and basil, but he brought it out right away, freshly washed and plentiful. Enough to make my soup orgasmic and have enough left over for omelets in the morning.  Totally worth the drive, will be back.",

They were really good about splitting the bill and didn't rush us (but were prompt when we asked for it).    I had the bun cha gio thit nuong (cold vermicelli with grilled sliced pork and crispy egg rolls), which was good, but the vermicelli was a smidge overcooked for my taste.   I also had the nem nuong cuon (roasted pork rolls / spring rolls), which were alright. The rice paper was fresh and not dry/thick, but the filling was mostly lettuce and not that interesting. The roasted pork was also not the same as the kind I'm used to finding in spring rolls, but it was tasty nonetheless.   Unfortunately, since I've never had the bun at Pho Saigon 8 and I have yet to try the pho at Pho Mai Lan, my goal of trying to compare them was not met. whoops! I'll definitely be coming back to give the pho a try.",

I posted a photo of the soup to hundreds of people through Facebook and  all the comments stated that  they never seen anything like that before even when they ate Pho Vietnam.   Take a look at my photo. That is actually the hoof or snout of some animal in my soup and my GFs as well. I have attached a picture so you can see.  The photo speaks for itself.   Sorry Pho MaiLan. I so wanted to give you a good review, and I just raised the the amount of stars I gave you specifically for your good customer service and for asking us to come back and try something that may not be so daring for first timers.",

Even the chef in the back expressed his discontent by ringing the bell several times when her dishes were not picked up. She was completely apathetic and incompetent, tossing the spoons down where they landed (together), not placing one at each setting. She looked utterly confused taking our order. I can't understand why she was hired!  This said, our favorite server Thai (not sure if I'm spelling his name right) came to the rescue, and fixed everything without us even having to ask!  The reason I updated this review is for those of you who got the new girl on your first visit. Please do not judge the restaurant by her. I can't imagine she will last. Go back and ask for Thai.   Fantastic experience every single time. The pho is our favorite in town, and everything else is fresh and delicious. The staff always goes above and beyond, the owner is very attentive and always has a smile. Do yourself a favor, and eat here. You won't be disappointed! We come 3-4 times a month.  Yeah.

I use to love ramen but its only chicken or beef broth offered so I converted to a pho lover! I'm very disappointed to hear they don't offer this because traditional pho is vegetable broth or so I've been told. Instead of pho I was suggested to try another noodle dish offered except it didn't have broth and was cold. I think it was call bun, but I may be wrong.

    "text": "Since I'm from Los Angeles, where there are tons of excellent Vietnamese and pho restaurants, perhaps what I consider average or good is skewed, here in Vegas? I haven't tried any other Vietnamese restaurants in Las Vegas yet, just Pho MaiLan.  The most off-putting thing about this restaurant was the service. The servers were OK (meaning, they seemed pleasant and indifferent*), but the service was almost non existent since they didn't seem to notice us when we entered or check on us when we were having our meal. (I wasn't wearing my invisibility cloak! Oy.) I had to flag down the servers to get any service, even to just get the menus.**   *Note 1: The workers were warm and friendly to one regular customer who entered to pickup his takeout order. But, they seemed apathetic to all the other customers.  **Note 2: The restaurant was at 20% occupancy when we arrived (around 5:30pm).   My dining companion and I both ordered pho dac biet. The food was average fare one would get at any given ordinary pho place...although, it tasted blander than average. (Side note: The customers were mostly non Vietnamese, myself included.)  The place looked clean and the standard pho restaurant condiments were provided at every table, which was nice: salt, pepper, sriracha sauce, hoisin sauce, and chili pepper sauce. I wanted a sauce dish, but didn't even want to bother wasting my energy flagging down the servers again for that, so I just used the plate beneath my pho bowl. (Although I had plenty of energy to write this review.)  Here is my ratings breakdown:  Ambiance and Cleanliness: 4 out of 5 stars (better than the average pho place)  Service: 0 out of 5 stars (Out of service! I have received far better service from fastfood drive-throughs.)  Food: 2.75 out of 5 stars (bland and ordinary)  VERDICT: It wasn't horrible, It was just EH. On a 1-10 scale, I give it a 4.5 (mediocre). On the star scale, I give it a 2.75 out of 5.",

I'm not sure what channel it was on, but it was that program where they show you the process of making something in a factory. We caught it from the middle to the end. It turned out to be a garage door. I thought that it was pretty entertaining.   I had the Pho Tai Sach w/my beef on the side. The veggies were fresh. The broth was good. The size of the bowl was decent. The beef was fresh and there was a good amount.  I will give them another try next time I'm in the neighborhood.  Thanks for lunch LiLy D!",

We ordered the crispy fried spring rolls, Pho Tai Bo Vien, Combo vermincelli, vietnamese sausage and marinated slice pork vermincelli, and kalbi ribs with rice. The food was very fresh and really flavorful, everything was really tasty especially the broth of my pho, the kalbi ribs was the best, tender and packed with flavor.

Items chosen included Eggrolls, shrimp and pork vermicelli, shrimp salad, catfish rice, spicy chicken wings, calamari, sizzling beef, & seafood noodle.   Egg Roll skin was not crispy as I'm used to. Filling not as tasty and condiments cut up a bit rough and wet (carrots not as long stringy for example). Probably wouldn't order that again.   The other items are really good. Shrimp salad it was just perfect with the right touch of sweetness we asked for salad without pork.  Chicken  wings had a wonderful sweetness n spicy tang . Seafood noodle was loaded with seafood. The sizzling beef was a bit on the tough side. Catfish is good. Calamari crunchy n tasty especially with sweet chili. We roll a bit different than American establishments since calamari usually served with lemon.   Thai iced tea is good but please don't stir in the cream for me. I like to see orange and white separation. That's how it's places serve it. I'm a sucker for mainstream normal in some cases.   Total for us $152 (gratuity included  for this large party.)   Million dollar question would we return? Yep we will!",

I went to Phi MaiLan with a low expectation hoping that maybe their food would prove me wrong and that it was worth going to eat and my instinct was pretty much right.  I ordered their pho and I tried the broth without putting any sauce just to see how it was and it wasn't bad. When I took a bite of the noodles, the noodles were really over cooked to the point where it was super soft. I had my girlfriend try it (she's Vietnamese) and she did not like it.  Before going to Pho MaiLan we read on the yelp reviews and it seemed to have many good reviews but like I said coming from Cali where there are lots of good food, this was not up there for us.  The staff was nice and friendly.",

Lol But I didn't have to be an expert to agree that the broth here is great! It's on the top of our list now. Great amount of meat in each serving, and they also have the option of having a smaller/larger bowl.

Egg rolls were pretty good too, filled with the thin clear noodles and veggies plus lettuce so you can wrap the egg roll like a lettuce wrap. I'm assuming that's what your supposed to do.  Service is always great. I was lingering there longer than usual and catching up with a friend and our server was really sweet and never gave us the stink eye to leave.

When I realized that they skimped back on their noodles and meat, obviously I needed another bowl to satisfy my craving. When I ordered another bowl, they charged me full price. They ran out of basil on me, boy just an all around whammy today. Should of just gone to Canes. Never again.   Still don't understand how they got a banner hanging outside saying best Pho, who voted?

QUICK.   service has been spotty for the last month and my last visit was the last straw. we came in and were led to a table by the window. a table that had a belly up roach on it. we were all kinda shocked and just stared at it. we called the server over and he was about to pick it up!! with his fingers!!! he must have thought about it and then used his rag. he started to walk away and almost like an after-though asked us if we wanted to sit at another table. uh YEA!   we ordered our usuals and waited. I started to look around and noticed the place was not as clean as it normally was. debris was building up along the edge of the window by the floor in the back. dirt was also accumulating under the booths, which was in plain eye view from my table.  our orders came and my extra noodles on the side were about half of what they used to serve. great... and my basil looked like it had seen better days. one of my meat pieces tasted not so good and my tendon was HARD and had an off taste.   overall this place itself looked like it had seen better days also. WHAT'S GOING ON PhoMailan???? we were huge fans, but it seems like since the manager (I think it was the manager) has been gone it has not been the same.  it takes a lot for me to put it out there like this and \"one star\" a business, but come on.  fix the problem.",

This pho restaurant is definitely a hidden gem!",

I appreciated the gesture and sat to wait for my pho. About 10 minutes later I have my to-go order of chicken and mixed vegetable with no noodles, just as I ordered. Flavor, size, and price were all exactly as I'd expect. Hopefully next time they have chicken broth available.",

I also ordered the banh mi with the grilled chicken. So good! It reminded me of the banh mi my mom would make when I was growing up.  Since this was a take out order, I skipped on the pho.  The food was solid, the prices are low, and the service (take out) was friendly.   Definitely stop by this place if you get a craving for home good ole Viet food!",

It was a bit hard to find as there are lots of plazas in the neighbourhood and they are a bit of a maze if you are not familiar with this area around Henderson.  If looking for the resto it's near Lee's discount liquors.   Entering the restaurant is was clean, nicely decorated and the people seemed welcoming. My friend who I ate with is Vietnamese so I told him usually I prefer a bun noodle dish vs a pho on a day when the weather is 75F outside. I went with a grilled pork and spring roll and my friend went with a catfish bun noodle. We shared a bit of each and his catfish was fried in a very interesting batter with a bit of dill. It was excellent crisp and very  unique but tasty flavour. My grilled pork was well seasoned with a nice lemongrass flavour, sweetness and a bit of salty. Overall it was a strong 4/5 for me. Clean, tasty, good portion size and price (not too heavy) is in my mind a slam dunk for Vietnamese food.",

The spicy chicken is a must to have starter/appetizer!   The Phos are great so are the fish meals.  The meat of pho came as raw and fresh and the soup is boiling hot, which is the authentic Vietnamese way.  Most Vietnamese restaurants don't serve that way at all, or you have to made a explicitly request and often than not the soup was not hot enough to cook the fresh raw meat well.   The soup base also is very good.  It has no MSG and tasted as genuine as you could get from a restaurant in Vietnam.   The waiters and waitresses are efficient and professional.  Do visit and try yourselves and make your own comparison.",

We decided to give this place a try, since most of the yelp reviews were tried and True.   Luckily we came at 4:45pm, just in time for happy hour, which is from 3-5pm (everyday)  This is what we ordered from the happy hour menu: all $5 each  Chao tom (shrimp cake/ shrimp patty) spring rolls - It was 2 rolls cut in half, making it 4 pieces and it was lacking so much! There was a paper thin piece of (chao tom) shrimp patty and it was all lettuce for the most part. The hoisen dipping sauce was tasty, but I just couldn't get past how skimped they were on the rolls. Not worth it, even at the happy hour price of $5. 1/5  Spicy chicken wings - These came out fresh from the fryer in 8 good sized, meaty wings. These were incredibly crispy and saucy! Packed with flavor, salty sweet, and spicy. I love how they were not afraid to pack on the flavor on each wing. Definitely finger lickin' good! 5/5  Pho dac biet (beef special pho) - the broth was good, yet the tendon was not tender and not good cuts. My boyfriend took them all out of his soup since he couldn't eat them - which is odd and not like him at all, since he loves tendon. Yet, for $5 for a small bowl, it's a good deal. 3/5  Pho ga (chicken pho) - the broth was good as well, but I couldn't really enjoy my chicken - they were pretty dry slices. Overall it wasn't the worst pho ga I've ever had and for $5 a bowl, it's still a great deal. 3/5  An hour after dinner we were the thirstiest we've ever been - I felt super dehydrated. As you an imagine, the food was very salty. Oh well, I guess If you want big flavor, you have to expect to be salt-bombed.",

We accidentally went through the back entrance. I guess this happens time to time. There was a man who was sweeping and he graciously invited us in, joking how it didn't matter which entrance we came through. He turned out to me our server as well. It wasn't a large gesture, but I really liked his demeanor.  We ordered the tofu summer rolls. They were full of fresh veggies and breaded tofu served with peanut sauce with fresh peanuts.  For my main I had the beef ball pho. The broth had a nice rich meatiness to it. The balls had a good  consistency and taste. The noodles were round noodles, I'm use to flat noodles, but they were still good.  I'd recommend this place for your next pho craving!",

I used to come here a lot when my office was still in Anthem. I would always get a bowl of pho or grilled pork chop.  Pho: I normally get a bowl of pho with any of the following: brisket, flank, and steak. The broth is excellent. They have different combinations including one with salmon. 5/5  Summer Rolls: Shrimp, pork, vermicelli, and greens wrapped in rice paper. The 2 rolls are cut in half and served with a peanut dipping sauce. 5/5  Roasted Pork Spring Rolls: Roasted pork, vermicelli, and greens wrapped in rice paper.  Again, the 2 rolls are cut in half and served with a peanut dipping sauce. The pork slices have that grilled taste to them. 5/5  Bun Dac Biet: Fried egg rolls, grilled pork, pork sausage, grilled shrimp, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and peanuts on top of vermicelli. You get that vinegar + fish sauce on the side. My friend who absolutely hates egg rolls loved it. 5/5  The service here is always great. I joke around with the employees. In general, the place is clean but sometimes it takes them a while to clear out tables.",

    "text": "I always go to Pho Saigon8 for my Vietnamese cravings, but this time, I thought... why not give Pho MaiLan another shot since it's been a while since I've been there & technically, it's closer to my house.  I called to place a togo order.  I spoke to a gentleman and I ordered the Summer Rolls and the bun cha gio thit nuong (sliced pork & eggroll vermicelli).  I also asked for a side of \"hot sauce\" to go since I like my food spicy.  I was told that it'll take 15 minutes.    30 minutes later, I entered Pho MaiLan.  I was greeted by a server and I told him I have a pick-up order.  He walked me to the register and said, \"Summer Roll, Bun, and a soup, right?!\"    \"No -- no soup for me,\" I said.    \"No?  You didn't order soup?  Are you sure?\"  \"Yes, I am sure.  I asked for extra hot sauce though.\"  \"Oh?  It sounded like you said you wanted a small pho when you called.  And I figured you meant you wanted small soup.  So, are you sure you don't want the soup?  It's only $1.\"  \"Yes, I'm sure ... I just want the fresh rolls, my noodles, and hot sauce please.\"  \"The soup is only $1.  Are you sure you don't want the soup?!\"  SERIOUSLY?!!!      By this time, I was getting irritated.  \"Listen, I do NOT want soup even if it's a dollar.  If I wanted soup, I would have ordered soup.  So, please,... can I just pay for my order?\"    He took my payment and disappeared.  10 minutes later, there was still no sign of him.  I was baffled because first, I was told my food would be ready in 15 minutes but it's been well over 30 minutes since I walked in.  The restaurant was not even busy so what's taking him so long?!     As I'm hovering by the cash register, an article on the wall caught my eye... it reads...  DRAB SERVICE MARS A GOOD MEAL at Pho Mailan by AL MANCINI (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flasvegascitylife.com%2Fsections%2Feat-drink%2Fdining-out%2Freview-drab-service-mars-good-meal-pho-mailan.html&s=f98c41b207154a010bcd7b806105e4df844c34593e8b597bbfac523b31b7bdd9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lasvegascitylife.com/sec...</a>).  This article was printed on May 8, 2013.  After reading the article, I shook my head.  Why the heck would the Management team frame this article and post this proudly in their restaurant?!  Is it to warn the customers that their service has NOT improved at all since 2013 and that we should just deal with it?!  Could it be the same server who help Al Mancini with HIS order?!  LOL!    Finally, another waitress passed by and I stopped her to inquire about my togo order.  A minute later, she came back with my order and said, \"Here you go!  Sorry for the wait.\"  Whatever happened to the dude who took my order?!  Maybe he was pissed I didn't want the soup?!   Oh - yeah,... the food.  The Summer Rolls were good.  The bun... Meh!  The sliced pork were salty and fatty.  I think I should drive further to Saigon 8 next time.",

Flavor was decent...    The springrolls looked like an 8 year old rolled them.  I've made better tasting & more uniform springrolls at home.  The place is hit or miss on service depending on who's working.  It's actually very good for the most part...the younger kid isn't the one you want waiting on you.  It's a clean place...they just need to iron out the wrinkles.  It's close to me so I guess I will eventually give them yet another shot, but this time trying out their rice dishes & banh mi.",

Second sign of trouble was when the other tables rice dish comes out before our pho even though they ordered after us.   Pho is pretty easy to make, the broth should be made already and all you need is to add the noodles, meats and garnishment. Ours took over 30 minutes for a party of four.  Admittedly they were crowded but like I said the rice dishes came out before the pho.   The broth was bland, the veggies were sparse and there was hardly any meat.   They pretty much ignored us, didn't give us napkins. When they brought out or dish, they asked who had the p6?  We asked which one is that and they said I don't know, it's the p6....  We just told them to put the bowls on the table and we'll sort it out ourselves.   Also, if you do decide to eat here, be sure to get here a good hour before they close because these guys want to get home and will lock the doors and turn away people an hour before they close.",

I've tried other 2 pho restaurants, but I liked this place much better because I really liked the flavor of the broth and the taste of the egg rolls.  The service was pretty good too. One waitress was very friendly and nice when we requested some things we need. That's one of what I had good impression about this restaurant at the 3rd visit and it brought me to write a review. I think the service is also important and a part of how we can enjoy the food.   That day the only thing I didn't like much was \"the beef stew with French bread\". I ordered it my first time as it looked so good to me looking at the picture of the menu, but when it was brought it up to me, unfortunately it wasn't like at all the one I was expecting from the menu.  Oh well, I don't order it next time and just stick to what I always order here.",

If you want chicken, tofu, veggies, different meats. If you want well cooked meats or odd meats (Tendons, tripe) it is all available and up to you. All you need to do to order a great PHO is to just figure out the meat you want...  2.  Broth - tasty, clear, nice.  I tend to like a bit more of the green onion and bits floating around adding to the taste.  3.  Other Dishes - Had the spring rolls and they were very nice.  Had the barbeque ribs as well and they were tasty.  4.  Drinks- The green tea ice tea is very light and an odd color, yet it has a subtle taste.  If you like soda from fountain instead of can or bottle, this is the place.  5.  Ambiance - very nice, bright, plenty of room. I kinda did not like the serving trays that hold the condiments as these seemed a bit dusty and collecting bits of stuff in it.  DONT look in it. Otherwise, very clean and nice.

    "text": "I ordered the lemongrass chicken and I ate two bites and was done. I thought if I took another bite, I wouldn't be able to keep it down. My husband, who eats anything, wouldn't eat it either. The chicken tasted like it's pre cooked and reheated.  All I could think of was that this place should be on kitchen nightmares. The plastic on the bench seat was split. The walls and floor need a good cleaning. I will NEVER go back.   I will admit that I am a picky eater and I hate complaining in restaurants. We paid $30 for two meals and ate two bites of mine and about 5 bites of my husbands. We paid and left full plates on the table. I couldn't get out of there fast enough!",

Really didn't know what to get so I got the Pork Chops, now I dont usually get me some swine when I eat out but these chops were good.  We also got some soup,it was nice and spicy and the size was big (for the small bowl).  I give a 4 stars for the friendly and helpful service and for the portion size and quality of the food.  And since its jus down the hill from me, more than likely LilMark will be back.",

We've been here several times since August, 2013 just to get the BBH.  It's authentic BBH and full of flavor.  However, we would not recommend anything else on the menu.  We tried rice dishes and appetizers and were not impress with any of them.  Waiters and waitresses were super friendly.",

I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because the food is tasty but if I'm comparing to other Vietnamese restaurants around town, I would have to say it's mediocre. The broth is a bit on the watery side and so is their siracha on the tables. They also pack way too much lettuce into their fresh spring rolls in order to make it appear more full. The prices are fair though and I'm actually a fan of their Asian chicken wings. I would still say to give it a try yourself.",

    "text": "Wow... I can't even come close to expressing how happy I am to find this place. I just moved here from CT and there was only 1 place in all of the state that was worth eating pho at. I had to drive all the way to Boston or NY for good pho. I've tried lemongrass, there service was typical Vietnamese service(order, eat your food and get out) and their food was not even close to being good enough to deal with poor service to come back. Been to pho Annie's and pho Kim long.... some dishes were good, but if you're talking about pho or bun bo hue nothing is like Pho Mailan. I've given up all hopes of finding a good pho place, but then the Pho gods delivered an UNBELIEVABLY GREAT ONE instead. Let's just say I cried a little while eating my meal and followed it up by walking into parked car after leaving bc I was in heaven and didn't notice the fixed hunk of metal I was gonna walk into. Walking into a parked chevy did not damper my just then incredible pho experience one bit. Oh and talk about great customer service... THEY HAVE THAT DOWN PACKED!!! Going back right after this review. I went 2 days ago. Hehe :-)",

Very good prices, easy in and out, quick and plenty of parking.   The only (minor) complaint is sometimes the noodles are not thoroughly cooked - I mean just a few of them, not the whole bowl.   Highly recommend.",
