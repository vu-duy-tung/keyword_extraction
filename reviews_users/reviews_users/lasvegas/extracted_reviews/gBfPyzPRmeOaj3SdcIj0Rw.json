    "text": "A few points:  1) Service can be better -- the way the seater spreads out the customers gives each one privacy, but with how the restaurant organizes, it makes it difficult to get back to guests in time when they are ready to order. I noticed that another waitress had to step in when I started getting impatient.  2) Good ingredients on the sushi -- the fish is on point. There was fish with sesame oil on top of my chirashi donburi that was fantastic. I didn't expect sesame oil to pair so well.  3) The rice for the sushi sucks. It's bland, it lacks proper levels of acidity. It takes away from the deliciousness of the other ingredients.",

    "text": "7/25: Located in Forum Shops at Caesars Palace casino. I looked up a site that lists sushi restaurants with Happy Hour available. This place was one of them and had a good rating as well, so I decided to give it a try. The food was pretty good, and most of the service was great.   It was pretty quiet a little before 6PM on a Thursday, and I walked up to the front without a reservation. My friendly hostess promptly and politely sat me down in the bar dining area, although I requested to sit at the bar. Not sure if she misunderstood me or not. (FYI: it was pretty hot in that area; I'm not sure if the A/C was on...the bar was just right). A Happy Hour menu requested, which wasn't available in that area, so one of the waitstaff courteously moved my beverages to the bar.   My bartender/waitress Lauren was awesome! She works pretty fast; there was an instance or two when I felt rushed, but that's better than slow service. She was very friendly and social, and we introduced each other as well. The rest of the staff was meh. Food was served in a reasonable amount of time, and the presentation was pretty cool.   TIP: I was told that locals get 20% off regular menu prices! (double check on that before you go)  -Kobe Meatballs ($6) -Fried Calamari ($4)  -Spicy Yellowtail Roll ($5 cut) -A2 Fusion Roll (albacore, onion, avocado & jalapeno...$5)  -Eel & Avocado Roll ($5)...I'm a fan of unagi and this was fresh and delicious!  -Mini Tropical Fruit Cheesecake ($3)...one of the best, if not the best, desserts I've ever had! They don't give you a huge slice, which can be a good thing. It's pretty sweet and rich, tastes like coconut with oreo crust. SO good!  -Iced Tea was \"only\" $3.50 as well (I think it's usually $4+ on the Strip). Lauren even offered a full cup to go, which I accepted of course.  All of the food was great, although I wasn't expecting a couple of items to come in such small proportions (meatballs and calamari). Happy Hour might actually be more profitable in terms of cost/profit margin and bringing in customers; not just here, but at most places.   Overall a pretty good experience. I have no doubt that I would be satisfied with the quality of the other appetizers. I'd come back again for \"Red Sun\" Happy Hour!",

I prefer the simpler items, and we had plenty of those, and they were just incredibly. The baked cod is also a great item to mix in with cold sushi.  For sake, we had cold unfiltered sake and it was delicious. A great alternative to the steak and shellfish restaurants in this area!",

    "text": "This place is located on the 3rd level of the Cesar's Palace Shops.  It was a bit of a walk, but well worth it.  We were craving sushi, so we were looking at all the reviews on yelp and decided to give this place a try.  Came at about Noon on a Tuesday, so it wasn't busy at all. We ordered the following:  - Salmon sashimi - the color is a bright orange and the taste was so fresh.  Definitely a very good grade of sashimi.  It's buttery and melts in your mouth.   - Cucumber roll - this was very good as well.  Most of the time cucumber rolls are just ok everywhere, but this was delicious.   - Spicy Tuna roll - I love spicy tuna rolls and this one was very good.  Just enough tuna and spiciness to make it a great roll.  - Pork Belly Fried rice - my husband loved this and so did I.  The fried rice is already packed with flavors, but when you mix the pieces of pork belly with it, it adds an explosion in your mouth.  So delicious!  - Uni pasta - this one was very disappointing. I've had uni pasta before, but this one just tasted like an alfredo sauce with pieces of uni.   Overall the sushi was great.  It's a bit pricey, so be prepared, but you get what you pay for.  Good sushi doesn't come cheap.  Staff was friendly and service was fast with the exception of my uni pasta.  That one took a little bit longer then everything else, but the server did prepare me for that.  I would definitely come back here for the fresh sushi and the fried rice next time I'm in town.",

We also ordered the Brussels sprouts - so delicious with chunks of bacon and sweet sauce. Then we had the katana sushi roll - the fish just melted in my mouth. We then had the toro roll, which was delicious and had a wonderful crunch from the jalapeno (but not very spicy). My friend ordered the pork belly fried rice - such a delicious, flavorful bite with fantastic texture and yummy egg. She also had the braised ribs which had a wonderful, unexpected melange of flavors. Our other friend ordered the chicken, which was delicious if not a little boring in comparison to all of the other amazing flavors on the table.",

There's the sushi bar if you want to simply experiment and order as you please.  There's a more cozy seating area near the entrance.  There's also a large area near some huge windows with a great view.  The staff has always been patient and willing to help a sushi-noobie figure out what to order.  I enjoyed sitting at the bar a couple times (I visit Vegas often) and the chefs are almost like bartenders.  They have personality and will talk with seated customers.    I've tried a number of different dishes (don't ask me to name them).  Before I took the plunge, I had steak and it was well prepared.  I haven't tried anything exotic like eel or squid and kept mainly to the safer meats like tuna and shrimp.  The food has been great.  This restaurant is usually near the top of my list to visit when I simply want to stick with what I know instead of exploring other restaurants.",

The waitress then forgot to put in one of our rolls and apologized in the most stand offish way possible saying it was a \"human error\" as if she wasn't even sorry about it.

The manager is super nice as well!  All of the staff are very attentive and helpful, and it's a great place for lunch or dinner.  I'm there every time I visit at LEAST once!",

    "text": "Went here during a visit to Vegas. Debated the oh-toro (fatty tuna) out loud and even our server commented that it was great and \"just melts in your mouth\". Ended up ordering 2 orders (4 pieces) of it along with our entrees.  The tuna we had looked like they were less than ideal cuts. Not only did they taste bad, they were likely the worst tuna I've ever had. A complaint to our server simply resulted in her shaking her head and saying \"not so good?\" with no offer of a remedy.  Two stars because the fried rice was pretty good.",

We had the katana roll - great mix of fish and you could add/remove as much of the spicy mixture as you like, a salmon sashimi special with yuzu foam - nice balance of flavor although slivered radish was a little strong for the delicate fish, a couple of hand rolls - the California had sweet mild Alaskan crab and the eel sauce on the unagi  was top notch. I love uni, and this met my expectations of fresh sea goodness.  The dessert of banana flambe was a huge wonderful surprise.  I am not a dessert person, but my nephew was there and he ordered this dish.  I had two bites before he finished it and OMG!  No flames at the table, but his spoon was on fire as he dug in!  Go here instead of Nobu when in Vegas if interested in creative sushi.",

Went here for my 21st bday and wedding reception. So amazing. Wonderful service. Wonderful people. Beautifully designed Asian fusion theme and soft music. Very relaxing time.  I will definitely be coming back another night.  Excellent food! Everything was fresh and delicious. I expected to pay At least 1000. Bill was half that, plus tip. Got a hookup on champagne for my wedding :)  So great!  I guess the only thing people should know is portions are very tiny. Good for me cuz im teeny but not the hubby lol For men you might end up hitting up a burger joint after but for the ladies it's perfect! I would definitely go again and again!",

The rolls run $5-6 and the drinks (including beer and champagne) were also around $5 a pop. The dessert is around $3 and it was a decent size.   We had great service also.",

( I got the lobster)  -Katana Roll (lots of fresh fish and tempura in it, it was large so we were able to share)  -Shima Roll,( if you like spicy this roll is the way to go)  -Salmon Carpaccio with Truffles ( anything with truffles and I'm in!)  -Hanabi , which is spicy tuna on thees rice cakes ( takes a little while to come out but worth the wait)  -Filet Mignon wrapped around asparagus it had a sweet sauce on top almost like teryiyaki but better (not a huge portion but perfect for an App with a couple people to share)  -Banana Flambe, its on the dessert menu but the menu doesn't do it justice( i might come back for that alone!)  So I went with 4 people and we all shared everything I think that was best way to go by far because we were all able to try so many different things, Oh and I cant write this review without mentioning the cocktails which were absolutely delicious ,my friend and i got the Tokyo Cooler and i could have drank about 10 of those! i will for sure be going back as soon as I can!",

Although it was not the least bit quiet as a result of Karaoke (sp) night at the club across the way, it was pretty quick. We had a very good rainbow roll, some nice hamachi, etc. The fish was very fresh and delicious. The rolls were a good size and not too over-priced. We thought it would have been even more expensive considering the atmosphere, but it was a pretty good price. I would go back to this place because it is conveniently located on the walkway that connects the Forum Shops to Caesars and was actually not far from the elevator to our room.

    "text": "Came to Sushi Roku with a bunch of friends and was able to secure the private room for a private dinning event. Located on the 3rd floor of the Forum Mall, Sushi Roku is probably one of the best Japanese restaurants that I've been too offering a beautiful view of the strip.   We got here and the room was all set for the 20 of us that would be dinning that night. As I mentioned before the private dinning has a great view of the strip. The atmosphere here is definitely hip with low lighting. You have the high end modern Japanese with lots of dark wood used throughout with hints of red and stone accent pieces. We had a prefix meal sampling meal served family style so all we had to do was sit down, drink several rounds of Saki bombs, and let the food come to us.   First up was the edamae. Fresh with a touch of sea salt was just the right way to start off a night of eating and doing Saki bombs. Next up was a Chinese chicken salad. Good, nice fresh mixed green lettuce with a dressing with a nice blend of balsamic and sesame to it. The shredded chicken was also very good. Chicken skewers were next up on the menu, again, very good. Chicken was done perfectly and the sauce that I had was a sweet sauce with a little bit of heat at the end. After the chicken out came the rolls, there was a traditional California Roll, (good but not mind blowing), the Spicy Tuna (though small, everything here tasted really fresh and with perfectly cooked sushi rice and a nice amount of heat, really really good) and probably the one item that everyone raved about was the fresh Soft Shell crab roll. While simple, it was just very fresh and outstanding. This alone I would come back for again. We got two desserts for the nice a chocolate lava cake with a vanilla cream sauce (second best I've had with the best being at Roy's in Maui) and Ice Cream Mochi which was pretty good.   The service here was excellent. Very professional and friendly especially considering how rowdy this group can get. Overall all the food and Saki cost around $80 a head which seemed reasonable for the amount of food and drinks we got that night. No one in our group of 20 left hungry and there was plenty of food left over. I have to say, this is one of the best Japanese restaurants that I've been to and will give Sushi Roki a rare 5 star rating!",

We were seated by the windows which had a gorgeous view of the strip overlooking the neon lights of Harrah's, Imperial Palace Hotel and Paris in the close distant.  We started with edamame, closely followed by a tuna tataki salad which had a hinge of too much vinegar but the tuna was good. Then we tried the toro with scallion roll - excellent, melted in the mouth, Roku and roll roll which had combination of 3 fishes, unagi sushi and toro sushi. Then we finished with the Chocolate Volcano which was a warm chocolate cake oozing with chocolate sauce in the center with vanilla bean ice-cream, it was delicious! 3.5 stars. I thought the sushi at Nobu was a tad better. But service was impeccable considering other prime restaurants with very poor and s-l-o-w services in the last few nights!",

The sushi was pretty good too.  Lots of fancy rolls along with the basics.  Got the seaweed salad as an app.  Good portion for 2 people.  It was different because they mixed in some baby green with the seaweed which added a different dimension to the dish.  The best thing we had was the fresh sweet shrimp(amaebi).  A little pricey but worth it.  It was served along with the deep fried heads.  Don't want to disgust anyone but if you been to new orleans, \"pinch the tails, suck the heads\"  Seafood perfection!",

Don't valet in front of Caesar's, go to the right of Caesar's (as you are approaching it and driving towards the valet area) and there is a driveway on your right.  Take that and it puts you in front of a steakhouse with valet.  Go to the 3rd level and there it is.  Nice place, great view, and the service seemed to be very good.  It wasn't busy for lunch though.  I had the basics - miso soup, yellow tail and halibut sashimi, and tuna nigiri.  It was all fresh and very good.  It is an expensive place though relative to sushi that can be had elsewhere.  If you're going to spend that much you may as well go to Nobu in the Hard Rock.  Nobu has marginal atmosphere but good crowds and great sushi.  I would come back here but only for dinner on a busy night.",

We ordered right before HH ended at 6pm, the waitress was super friendly and patient as a few of us who arrived late ran in just in time to place our orders.    The table had the hummus with pita bread ($6) to share after hearing good reviews on it.  I found this dish was just OK though I'm not normally a fan of hummus anyways. We ran out of Pita bread and had to order more as we still had plenty of hummus left. I personally had a Hot Sake ($3), the Brussel Sprouts ($5), the RibEye wrapped Asparagus ($7), and the A2 Fusion sushi roll ($6).  The veggie dishes all tasted great! The crispy pork that came with the brussel sprouts added nice contrast in texture and taste to complement the already well flavored brussel sprouts. The asparagus dish was also done well - loved the soy-mirin sauce - and easy to cut through and eat (meaning the rib-eye was done just right and wasn't too overcooked or tough). The A2 Fusion sushi roll was disappointing though, I don't even remember how it tastes now...   The prices are great for being in Caesars Palace, the quality was there, and the food had great flavors for the most part. Service was also excellent; we were checked on frequently but not intrusively, and all with friendly smiles. Would definitely come here again to try more of their dishes.",

I ordered 2 rolls, sashimi and wine for $25.00. It was a great deal and it tasted amazing. My favorite dish was the sashimi. I ordered the Tuna Tataki w/Garlic Ponzu and I was in heaven. It was so fresh and just melted in my mouth. I loved it. I wish I had went back today just to get more lol. I also ordered the A2 Fusion, this role was good but it was a grayish color do ascetically it wasn't very pretty. But it wasn't bad. My second favorite roll was the Rock Shrimp Tempura w/Jalapeno...this was just delicious. Fresh, a little spicy and very filling. Writing this review, I think I know what I'm having for dinner...my mouth is watering!!! :-)",

We had the dinner which included appetizers, main course and dessert.  Theme was hot and cold so since there was two of us we decided to try each one.  For cold appetizers we had a trio of salmon, albacore and tuna carpaccio.  Delicious especially the salmon.  Hot included sea bass, rib eye wrapped asparagus and tatsuta age chicken.  Also really good especially the sea bass.  Main course included a variety of sushi nigiri and a BAKED CRAB handroll which was amazing!! We ended up ordering more.  The other dish was filet mignon with mushrooms and garlic truffle oil.  It was good but that baked crab took the prize.  Dessert was a Yuzu creme brule with green tea ice cream along with a trio of flavors of mochi ice cream.   All in all the meal was great and Ill definitely have to come back again for the baked crab hand roll.",

    "text": "I saw this restaurant on yelp and figured I'd give it a try. I made a reservation on open table because we needed to eat before heading to see the Backstreet Boys! When walking in we were greeted warmly by the staff and chefs. The ambiance and decorations are comforting and fit well with the type of cuisine. We ordered edamame and two rolls and I felt like we were moaning with every bite. One of the rolls (something with crab I think?) tasted like it was broiled over a flame and it was absolutely the best tasting roll I've ever had in my life. We ended the meal with their take on s'mores, which was served on a plate of crushed graham cracker with a small flame to melt the marshmallow, chocolate pieces and mochi. It was cute, packed with flavor, but difficult to eat. Still, we really enjoyed our experience and will definitely come back here the next time we check out Vegas!",

But if you want decently priced, good quality sushi - I recommend you take your money elsewhere. The boyfriend and I made reservations during our recent trip to Vegas to celebrate his birthday and we felt like we ordered a good amount of food - but the portions are pretty small, more like tapas and not main courses. We got the baked lobster roll, the tuna jalepeno roll, the eel avocado roll as well as free range chicken dish. The sushi wasn't quite as \"fresh\" as we expected and the chicken was... dry. The check came up to a little over $100 and we although we are pretty small eaters we had to go and get a round of burgers at shake shack later that night so we didn't have to go to sleep hungry.",

Their tuna jalapeno roll (modified without the jalapeno) was my favorite. The citrus olive oil in the roll complimented the tuna and avocado really well. Their tuna melted in your mouth like butter and the soft shell crab roll was amazing. I've never had crab in sushi before but I gotta say, this exceeded my expectations. The pineapple fusion was also delicious. The vanilla bean in the drink was a nice touch and the drink went well with our rolls.   The atmosphere is nice and we were seated right away. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for something good to eat on the strip.",

My husband and I have been together nearly 9 years, and my family has never really met his family. Since my husband loves sushi, I found this place on yelp, due to the incredible yelp reviews as well as they serve affordable lunch combination plates. However, when we got there, since it was on the weekend, I guess they did not have and lunch specials. We ordered quite a bit here, we were a party of 6. My family being doesn't really eat sushi, or anything raw, I knew it was going to be interesting. We ordered tempura and miso cod fish for them. We ordered this delicious sashimi with shaved blacked truffles on it. Also a couple of yellowtail rolls. This was my first time trying ikura, and it was delicious and very fresh. We also ordered some bluefin tuna and it was very fresh and practically melted in your mouth.  For fresh delicious sushi, this is a definite must.  On an unrelated note, the women's bathroom stalls are really really low. Considering I'm already short, I had the stoop pretty low. That I found amusing.",

Everyone ordered something different and we did a lot sharing, so I think I had a taste of 10+ rolls! I absolutely loved the crab roll, and the edamame and hummus appetizers were outstanding as well. What is that bread they use with the hummus?! It's other worldly, and I must have more. I would definitely recommend!",

The asparagus was cooked, but still had it's crunch in the center. (HH: $6)  - A2 Fusion: consists of albacore, onion, avocado & jalapeno. One of the best rolls I've had in a while. (HH: $5)  You'd get more with sushi roll, $4 handroll isn't worth the quantity.  Decor was simple, had a hint of modern, and even thought it's in Vegas, felt like I was in California, if that makes any sense. LOL  For Happy Hour, you'd have to sit in a designated spot. Only minus 1 star, because I had to sit with people who were trash talking about Asians at the same table. It's not their fault, but I wasn't able to move from the table to another spot to avoid hearing them continuously bash on my culture. Made my eating a bit awkward.",

That said, being hundreds of miles away from the Pacific Ocean was not encouraging me to consume sushi in Las Vegas. But, Sushi Roku was a pleasant sushi slap to the face! The Happy Hour was a True hour, 5pm to 6pm, so if you are local and looking to head there at this time... do not underestimate the traffic! We made it with about 15 minutes to spare and were able order our meal, happy hour prices and all!  Said prices were around half off, and hand rolls were cheaper than cut rolls, but are not great for sharing. The rolls were a good size and the fish was good quality. I have found few places that use real crab in their CA rolls and luckily Sushi Roku's were on the money!  My favorite rolls of the night were tuna / avocado, tempura sweet potato, rock shrimp / jalapeno, & spicy scallop  (which I absolutely had to try because it was new & exciting).   I will be trying more sushi restaurants on the strip. But will also be a reoccurring customer at Sushi Roku for their happy hour! Loved their quiet location in the Forum Shops, hip / cool ambiance, and sushi bar / table / bar-bar options for seating.",

We were both craving sushi and staying on the strip and we just picked this place because it was close and had good reviews. I am so glad we did! Every single thing we ate was absolutely superb! Even the miso soup was amazing! We had shrimp dumplings, makoto rolls, a roll with tuna, shrimp and asparagus and a spicy salmon roll special. All of them were so light and fresh it was unreal. They were also very accommodating to substitutions, as I have an avocado allergy. Service was on point and the atmosphere was dim, but very pleasant. The lava cake was unlike any we had ever had before, and I have had a few! Some people have expressed displeasure with the prices, but we found them to be fair given the area. We live in Miami and most dinners are on par, if not slightly more expensive than the one we had at Sushi Roku. Definitely one of the best sushi restaurants I've ever been to. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I wanted so badly to love Sushi Roku... but alas, poor service has ruined an otherwise wonderful restaurant.  But there's just no excuse for bad service in a high-end, expensive Vegas restaurant like this. Not when there are so many other amazing restaurants to enjoy.  The first time I came here, we were promptly seated at the sushi bar, where we just sat... forever... with nothing.. no drinks, no water, no menu. We looked uncomfortably around wondering if the restaurant was really even open yet. I finally had to awkwardly ask the sushi chef if we were supposed to order drinks from him (which is normally bad etiquette in a sushi restaurant, as the chefs only make the sushi). Finally a waitress showed up with menus and took our drink orders. And at some point later in the evening, those drinks finally found their way to us.  In sharp contrast to the incompetent waitress, the sushi chefs were AMAZING. We ordered several of the high-end specialty sushi rolls (at about $26 a roll), and what we received was as delicious as it was beautiful. My favorites were the Titan roll, which was like a piece of art, and the Katana roll. Everything was so fresh and tasty.  Meanwhile, we finished our drinks and ordered a second round. Once again we waited.. and waited... and waited. Keep in mind, there wasn't ANYONE else in our section... the restaurant was not busy at all, the bartenders at the bar looked bored... yet we waited and waited and waited some more for our drinks. By now, we had already finished the meal, and honestly, probably even digested it already. Once again I had to awkwardly ask the sushi chef for help. Only this time I asked for a manager (after explaining to the chef that he had done nothing wrong!).  The manager apologized, and soon we had our drinks. But really, we didn't even care at that point because we were ready to leave. Then I was shocked when I first received the bill, as nothing had been comped, but later when the slip came for me to sign, I found that he had comped the drinks and some of the sushi, so at least there's that.  In our most recent trip to Vegas, we decided to give this restaurant another shot, since we liked the sushi so much. This time we sat at a table with a great view of the strip. I really liked the decor of the dining room, and felt quite comfortable there. But once again, the service disappointed us.  The first item we tried to order was the Oyster sushi, and were told they were out.  Next we tried to order the Spanish Mackerel sushi, and were told they were out of that too. Finally we ordered some rolls that they did have... and the waiting began again. As more and more time passed and we still hadn't received our sushi, I realized that this restaurant just has fundamental service problems. The waiter apologized and explained that sushi chefs were \"slammed,\" but really, there's just no excuse for that when you are paying $26 a roll. We had tickets to see a show later, and I was starting to stress about whether we were even going to make it on time. I was also annoyed when the waiter gave us only a little bit of wasabi and ginger, to share, and then he even took that away partway through the meal!  I had to ask for more.  I think this restaurant has so much potential, and I really do think the sushi here is very good. But bad service just ruined the whole experience for me. If it weren't for the great sushi and wonderful view of Vegas, I'd definitely be giving this restaurant only one star. Later in this same trip, we ate at Blossom in the Aria hotel, paid $20-$25 per entree, and had some of the most amazing service we've had in a restaurant. When you are in Vegas, you want to have fun and be treated like a king... and Sushi Roku just didn't do it for me. So disappointed.",

    "text": "I ate at Sushi Roku along with two other people last Sunday at around 5:30pm.  It wasn't crowded so we got a booth overlooking the window.  The waitress was attentive and the Asian-influenced ambiance was nice.  We ordered just enough food to feed the three of us.  The cost was around $120 dollars for three people, including two small sakes.  The dishes we ordered included:  APPETIZER Hanaki Spicy Tuna on crispy rice cakes - This was quite good with a nice amount of spicy tuna on top of individual rice cakes.    The tuna had just a touch of spiciness.  There were about 5-6 pieces.  Sweet potato tempura (two pieces) - We had to send it back the first time because the sweet potato wasn't cooked enough.  It came out better the second time.  I probably won't order the tempura again.  SUSHI Unagi Hand Roll - It was a standard unagi hand roll, which is my favorite sushi.  The sauce wasn't overpowering like some unagi hand rolls. California Hand Roll - It was tasty since they included generous portions of real crab meat.  MAIN ENTREES Chilean Sea Bass with Sauteed Spinach entree (Added Miso Soup and Rice for $6 which was a bit pricey) - I felt the fish was moist but had a fishy aftertaste but one of my guests thought it was perfectly cooked.    Pan-fried  spicy jumbo shrimp with homemade potato chips - The shrimps were good-sized and were perfectly cooked. The sauce was not overly spicy.  The homemade chips were an interesting addition and tasted good with the sauce.",

Both of us eat sushi regularly, and tend to be a bit picky, but Sushi Roku delivered. After finally locating the restaurant (we got lost in the HUGE Ceasars hotel), we were greeted by the super cute and friendly door girls. I was pleased that we had a table with a great view of the strip. Our server was helpful in recommending drinks, and we both started off with an order of Miso Soup and Vegetable Tempura. The soup was the perfect amount and so flavorful, the Tempura hot, fresh, and delicious. For sushi, we decided on the Yellowtail, Salmon, Crunchy Spicy Tuna, and Tuna. Everything was spectacular! The yellowtail was fresh and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I wasn't a HUGE fan of the Crunchy Tuna, only because I don't really like 'hot' rolls, but it was still yummy and hit the spot. For dessert we had the Creme Brulee Trio, which topped off the meal perfectly. I would definitely return, the service was great and for the price (especially in Vegas), you cant go wrong!",

I placed one order at a time trying a lot of different fish and had the best o-toro sushi I've ever. What was great was that the sushi chef recognized right away that I was basically creating my own omakase and so he tried out a couple things on me like searing one of the o-toro sushi pieces, brushing it with some sort of a sauce and placing a truffle on top for what was an amazing one bite food experience. Unlike at Okada a couple of days earlier, Mirugai was very different tasting it was very fresh and much better. All of the sushi was very good, best sushi I've had in Vegas. The one kitchen dish consisting scallops and foie gras wasn't good. Each scallop was huge and lightly seared on the outside raw on the inside but just didn't do it for me.    On my second trip to Sushi Roku I sat at the sushi bar once again, this time with a different chef. I didn't go all out like the last time but the sushi that I did eat this time was once again very good.",

We did a tasting type deal where they brought out many different dishes of sashimi, rolls and such, everything was fresh and nothing like I had ever had before. And I am one who did not eat much raw sushi before this trip. It is going to be very hard for me to eat sushi just from anywhere from now on and previously I was ok with eating Kroger sushi :) This will be a definite stop for me when I return to Vegas and a definate recommendation for those who are in the vicinity. I love this place!",

Although it was a little tricky to find well worth the travel through the forum shops to the 3rd floor. Our waiter Greg L. was phenomenal. His passion and experience made the food that much better. I highly recommend not looking at the menu and giving your waiter some time to ask you a couple of questions (hopefully they are as good as Greg L.) and letting them show you the ropes. Between the service and the food, members from our group grabbed seconds of rolls and sushi that the dont normally eat. I don't have to think twice as to where I'm taking my clients and partners to eat next time I'm in the area.  Great food, great atmospher, great service.",

AWESOME VIEW Located on the second floor inside Caesars Palace, Sushi Roku looked promising because of the attractive decor and beautiful seating, the place practically looked like a lounge. Oh and I forgot to mention that the view is pretty awesome.   Our reservations were made for 10pm on a Thursday night, which I kind of thought was weird because they close at 10 BUT hey whatever.   KEEP ON ROLLING WITH THE DISAPPOINTMENTS We ordered at least 10 rolls, might have even been 12. But each roll that came out was just as disappointing as the next!!! I'm not use to eating crappy sushi, can't expect too much from a Japanese restaurant on The Strip. The last roll that came out had my friends wanting to spit it out, they described the taste as rosemary soap (WE SENT THE DISH BACK BECAUSE IT WAS THAT BAD). Needless to say I did NOT try it because knowing me and my gag reflexes, I would have thrown up on the person sitting across from me after eating that.   One star for the laid back ambiance and awesome view.",

    "text": "Cute place. The interior is very upscale, and intimate. It's a nice place to have a nice romantic dinner with the love. I would suggest to request the strip view when dinning in because the strip view is just lovely.   The menu is ok. I personally prefer authentic Japanese cuisine at a local area (Spring Mountain!), but there are a few things here that I like. Their signature martinis are good! I would definitely recommend the Lychee martini. You get a big piece of Lychee as a garnish, and you can taste the Lychee flavor of the martini. So if you are all for a nice sweet taste to your martini I'd definitely recommend it.  Our group ordered the Seared Tuna Tataki, Seaweed Salad, Yellowtail Sashimi, Crunchy Spicy Tuna, Rock Shrimp Tempura, and Chicken Yakitori Skewers. To me, it was nothing special or anything that stands out to where I feel like this place might be the only place to satisfy a distinct craving. The food is very light, fish is fresh, and the portions are small.   I haven't tried the Omakase yet, but I would like to actually try it once to see if it is worth spending $90 for. The Omakase might be the only thing worth gambling on. All in all the experience was nice and the service was wonderful. If you don't mind burning a big hole in your pocket for a nice fine dining experience, and a small stomach and appetite then I would recommend it.",

I've never cared for oysters. I've tried them several times but they have always tasted like ocean death snot. So I was pretty amazed when I discovered here oysters that I -not only- don't hate, but actually enjoy eating. Big win!  But what really impressed me was that literally every dish they brought to our table was mouth-wateringly, succulently, mind-blowingly tasty... and amazingly FRESH.   I'm not usually into sashimi but DAMN. Just wow.  Even the lobster dish (we're from Maine so of course we have pretty high standards for lobster) was absolutely the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>.   We had a friend with a gluten allergy with us and they were extremely attentive and understanding, offering alternative dishes for every one that had gluten in it. They made him a fresh crab leg roll that didn't look like much, but he couldn't finish it so asked if anyone wanted it. I was stuffed but I wanted to try it. I was so blown away at the simply fantastic, sweet-savory flavor of the crab roll that I couldn't stop eating it. I ended up finishing it because apparently I have no off switch and let's face it, you only live once.  Bonuses: the cocktails were on point, the atmosphere was comfortable, and our server actually spoke Japanese!   Sushi Roku was not only the best sushi restaurant I've ever tried... I legitimately believe it was one of the best restaurants of any kind that I've ever tried! I'm starting a savings account so that next time I am in Vegas I can be sure to afford to eat here again!",

Wow, everything was \"oishii\". I wanted to savor each bite as long as I could. \"Gochiso-sama deshita!\" It was fun chatting with my friend again, the other servers were very respectful too, and on top of that, she gave me the 20% discount for Las Vegas locals, which I didn't know about.

I saw Sushi Roku was in Caesar's Palace Forum shops (2nd Floor in the top left corner) and it had great ratings, plus it wasn't extremely expensive like all the others within walking distance. It was not crowded and was very trendy inside. We started with calamari, edamame and dirty martinis.  The calamari was so good.  It was lightly fried and the tempura was somewhat sweet. It had a light jalapeno glaze on it which was not hot at all but had just the right amount of flavor. Additionally, their dirty martinis were fantastic.....it's very hard to find a good one.  I will note, they are expensive, but worth it.  For dinner we had the White Lotus Roll and crab fried rice. The rice was delicious and had a very fair amount of crab in it. The White Lotus Roll was light with popcorn shrimp, avocado with tuna and crispy onions.  For desert we had the Cinnamon Sugar Doughnut Holes (HIGHLY RECOMMEND).  We will be back. You can also make reservations on their website or open table :)",

I say sushi executed at the highest level is 70%rice 30%fish.  The rice at the bar is prepped meticulously;  perfectly al dente, exact same temperature as the fish, just enough moisture and wasabi paste to stick onto fish.  The fish is aged PERFECTLY, breaking clean at the teeth and giving enough funk to remind you what you are masticating afterall.  The steak, oh the steak - absolute, beautiful piece of prime rib eye charred to a perfect medium rare,  served with roasted garlic butter with a side of blanched green beens.  Heaven my friends, absolute heaven.  Great place to grab dinner after some shopping.  It's top notch sushi and steak for about $25 per person.  Worth every penny.  5 stars.",

Perfectly prepared miso with a touch of spiciness made it an innovative take on a staple.  I then had the toro carpaccio which was rich and unctuous. The toro was ultra-fresh and minimally topped so the flavor of the fish stood out.  For my entree I went with the Matsu special which was 8 pieces of nigiri each with it's own special toppings and/or sauces. I particularly liked the toro and salmon offerings which were dressed with ingredients that completely enhanced the flavor of the sushi.   Service was great and while it is indeed pricey you are having your meal prepared by a classically trained sushi chef who puts care into each preparation.",

    "text": "Of course everyone comes here because of their great ratings, but from my experience this place deserves 3 stars!  Ambience: This is probably what gets this place such great ratings. No lie it's really nice and high up with great views. The lighting is dim, creating a nice romantic evening vibe! Everything is nicely decorated too. Ps. I hope you guys find this place easily if you're still planning on coming after this review because it took me 30 mins haha it's in the mall!!!! 3rd floor!  Food: the food is really really bland and mediocre unless you came with the notion that you are going to spend 300$. I got two sushi rolls (shrimp tempura and spicy tuna) and they were both not appealing at all. If this place had Mikuni quality sushi I would have been okay with paying such high prices, but literally the food was so plain and definitely not worth what we paid.   Drinks: We got a sake bottle that was like flavored sweet sake which was good, it was 40$ and is around 8 shots worth of sake  Service: the service wasn't bad, our lady frequented our table around 3-4 times total when we were there! The weird part is that they already add the tip to your bill, and she added 21%. I usually understand when there's 8+ people that they do that but there was only 4 of us! A little strange...   Also heads up for if you are planning on coming during a special holiday; because on New Years to cancel your reservation they charge 50$ a person",

Both times I have been here has been in between lunch and dinner, so it has been quiet and practically have the place to ourselves.  Service has always been fast, friendly and thorough.  Everything I have had here has been amazing.  One of my favorite things is their kimchee cucumber appetizer.  This is the best \"pickle\" I have ever had. This is so delicious and it takes them 4 days to make it and it is worth it!!!  Two other of my favs are the Unagi and the Korean Pork Belly Fried Rice.  Unagi is cooked perfectly and is so delicate it melts in your mouth.  The Pork Belly Fried Rice is not only a beautiful dish to look at, but it tastes amazing.  There is a good sized portion of pork belly and the poached egg is really the cherry on the top.  For you Saki drinkers, they have an extensive list to choose from.  This has become a must visit restaurant every time I'm in Vegas.  Definitely worth finding the elusive 3rd floor in the Forum Shopping Mall",

Just not on holidays. I did not like the R'eye cocktail, but Erin switched it for me to a Salary Man which is the same one I had last time. I still LOVE their crispy rice with spicy tuna (it's called something else there) and their baked crab hand roll. We ordered the Katana Roll, Tuna Jalapeno Roll, and Baked Lobster Roll and all were delicious, our favorite was the Tuna Jalapeno. We didn't have dessert but next time I want to try the cinnamon donuts, Erin said they are awesome. Can't wait to come back for another date night and use our local discount!",

So on this American holiday, I decided to go Japanese..and was glad i did!  The place is somewhat hard to find in the forum shops of Caesars Palace, being on the third floor of a mall that is built to confuse tourists and make them spend more money on high end items that they think they need. Anyway, once it's found, it will be easier to make your way back on the next visit.   I heard happy hour is amazing, unfortunately I didn't make it in time. But the view of the Las Vegas strip, away from the bar helped ease the pain of missing out on cheap drinks. I still ordered a cocktail but it was a bit overpriced for the size-good nonetheless, just small.   My group ordered the baked lobster rolls, eel avocado rolls, popcorn shrimp rolls and shrimp tempura rolls  I couldn't complain at all on any of the rolls. Very flavorful and plated beautifully.  The lobster rolls were very different..but good! Definitely worth trying.   Service was also excellent and my waitress was very helpful with explaining things on the menu. Also, before I was seated, the manager was standing near the front and struck up a conversation with myself and the person i was with. He was surprised to find out we were Vegas locals and let me know that \"locals are always treated well.\" We most certainly were treated well and I will always come back to a place that loves locals! Hopefully next time for happy hour!",

The restaurant decor was tasteful, elegant, zen, modern, but still inviting. There was 2 choices for 1st course and 2nd course on the restaurant week menu, so we decided to order both and share. Each appetizer came with 3 different items, so we got a total of 6, and every one of them was amazing! We then shared the surf and turf, and the chef's sushi selection. I would have to say that the sushi here is the best I've had in town. It's better than Nobu, better than Blue Ribbon, better than Samba, and better than Raku. Then to complete our meal, the trio mousse just completely satisfied my palette, beautifully presented, and tasted just as beautiful.  Our service was a bit lacking, my tea was filled here and there, but not constantly. Other than that, it was a great experience, and I would definitely be returning to try some of the other",

I sat in the front area on one of my trips, which felt like I was paying high prices to eat sushi in a mall (because basically, that's what I was doing). If possible, asked to be seated in the back area. The setting is dark and romantic, and the windows showcase a spectacular view of the city. On a scale from 1-5, I would rate the sushi here a 3.5. Fairly middle of the road with a few nice surprises. I eat mostly raw rolls, and their menu has a lot of cooked rolls on it, which they were willing to modify for me, but the menu selection was quite small. If you are debating between Nobu and Suski Roku for sushi, let this place be the winner. Overall, not a bad place to visit, but if I come back to Vegas, I will likely check out a new place for sushi.",

The waitress told us it was a good portion and we would be fine each getting one.  Mind you it's $120 each.  When the food started coming out, the portions were insanely large which would have been great if we hadn't already purchased apps.  We ended up stopping at course 5 bc it was just too much and we were very annoyed that the waitress didn't just tell us and instead was just trying to up her sales and we didn't even get to enjoy it.  We don't mind spending the money but the waitress was very dishonest, we won't be going back.",

    "text": "Love me some Sushi Roku in all locations (there's a few of them).  This review is about Las Vegas.  Food is always delicious. Pretty much same menu across locations. The menu is unique (gourmet?) and a bit limited. They do not create substitutes. (in other words, if it ain't on the menu, you can't have it)   Definitely make a reservation for this one because it's hard to get into to after 6pm.  And ask for a strip view (table by the window) if you're on a date. ;)   The staff is always on the ball and pretty quick - even with a large group.  Like it's sister restaurants, the seating is somewhat 'tight' (if you're a big dude or gal, caution the seating set-up: not just distance between tables, but also distance from your lap to table top in some areas)    As far as location - it's on the end of the Forum Shops inside Cesar's (strip side) Take the windy escalator all the way to the top.   When i stay on that end of the strip, i like the convenience of walking to Caesars and slipping in the side door. (I call it the \"sneaky door\" -- right after (or before) Mirage.) Thus avoiding the casino completely and that loooonnnnggg walk through the length of the Forum shops.  We are repeat offenders when we're in Vegas. We often bring guests or business associates (when there for convention) because we know we can rely on the food quality, atmosphere and  service every time.",

    "text": "We ate at Sushi Roku at an off-time around 2 pm, and the restaurant was not very crowded.  Much of the seating in Sushi Roku offers excellent Strip views which is a definite plus.  We were originally going to be sat at a booth/table close to another couple, but asked to be sat at a separate table for a bit more privacy.  The hostess got very huffy and irritated when we made this request, so our dining experience did not begin well.    The server was efficient, but not overly-friendly.  We ordered edamame, miso soup, and several sushi rolls (Katana, spicy tuna, California, and toro & jalapeno).  The food was good, but overpriced, and the quality/taste wasn't heads and tails above more economical sushi restaurants.  Of course, you're on the Strip, not to mention paying for a Strip view, so the high price is to be expected.  All in all, if you're looking for a sushi restaurant with a Strip view, Sushi Roku is not a bad bet.  For me, however, there are several other \"Strip view\" restaurants that I prefer over Sushi Roku, so I can't say I'll be eating here often.",

We were seated at a table that had great view of the strip; more amazing when lists lit up at night.    Started with some miso soup and seaweed salad along with sake; all were perfect.  Ordered the yellowtail diced chilies - unique dish with a great kick that complimented the yellowtail.   Next we moved onto the Katana and Tuna Japaleno; two dishes that went down so well.  To finish off, we went off the menu and ordered the gold truffle yellowtail.  This may be the best kept secret in Vegas - inside the yellowtail is some foie gras tucked in.  The sushi was heaven on earth; one of the best I've ever had.  Overall this is one of best sushi restaurants, period.",

Great service by the wait staff, excellent sushi and non sushi items.  The truffle sushi roll was AMAZING!  The restaurant has a great view of the strip and was exactly what I wanted for my birthday dinner in Vegas.  The waiter brought out a dessert and a candle/sparkler to help my group celebrate my birthday.  The prices not out of control either.",

At this point, it was worth it because we were frustrated, needed a drink and were super hungry after the unexpected workout.   That being said, they must get that often because they held our reservation or they just weren't that busy.   I'm guessing it's the latter.  In it's hey day, it was probably the talk of the town and it's still a nice restaurant with just a touch of over ambiance but they do offer gorgeous views of the strip.    The food was great  and priced really well if you need a sushi fix.   Our waitress was super nice and on top of the service.   We let her know that we were short on time and had to make a show.   She was attentive but not pushy and made sure we got our food timely.   Ask for recommendations on food because there are a number of special rolls that are available and not on the menu.   The Lotus roll in particular was very good.  There is seating by the windows and booths along the wall.   Ask for the booth because it is more comfortable and also a raised section, that's where the best view of the strip can be found.",

Pricing is very reasonable (for dining on the Strip) and the staff was super friendly.

The Ikura, Uni were both good, but again not over the top. The soft-shelled crab was very nice. We also had a couple of rolls that again were good, but not memorable. All in all it was a good dinner.

The big windows gave us a great view of the strip.  Props to our waiter for pushing the yellowtail diced chilies hard. In addition to the great service he provided, his recommendation was maybe the best thing we ate.   We ordered several rolls, most of them some variation on spicy tuna. We also ordered the crab roll. With the exception of the tuna jalapeno roll, all of them were great. Nothing mind blowing creatively, just quality ingredients and great execution. The jalapeno in the tuna jalapeno roll was just too spicy and washed out all of the other flavors. Just remove the jalapeno and you have a fine tuna roll. In addition to the rolls we ordered the short rib fried rice which was also delicious.  For dessert we had the donut holes and the green tea tiramisu. The tiramisu was a little light on flavor and I wasn't a big fan of the donuts but at this point I was completely full so I wasn't in the best position to judge.  The bill also wasn't as much as I'd expected to be. Good times.",

    "text": "Ok, I was wandering around Caesars Palace for snips and giggles and found myself on the top floor at Sushi Roku (which they have one out here in LA) and this place, though pricy, was what I expect from a great sushi restaurant. Friendly and quick service, happy customers (even sat next to some guests from Toyko, they were very nice) and the chef was top notch, he even gave me something on the house. I think business was slow so he was just warming up his knives.   I shared a meal with myself and was very happy I did. When you're here for a month you try a little bit of every cuisine so expect more from me the whole month of April.   But if you happen to come across this place it may be fancy, it may be pricey, but it's worth the extra 2 bucks on the rolls for the service and quality.   Enjoy!",

I ordered a couple pieces of tuna and salmon sushi, as well as a spicy tuna hand roll, which I use as a measure of any sushi restaurant I visit.  Both were excellent, but the hand roll was a real surprise.  Many times I have had a hand roll that was acceptable, but this restaurant went the extra step to crisp the nori before wrapping the spicy tuna.  The result is an extraordinary crunch of the seaweed before biting into the perfectly seasoned tuna.    Excellent atmosphere and great staff coupled with the food made me want to bail on my appointment and stay for a major feed.  Next year I plan to do just that!",

I was starving so I just ordered a bunch of things. I LOVE the spicy tuna on crispy rice. In fact, we ordered a second serving. Sushi was fresh and excellent. Albacore in particular.   Now remember we were pretty much the only people in the restaurant. So I have to say that the service was not the best. It wasn't horrible, but it was a bit slow and our server was MIA most of the meal. In fact, one of the items never came, but she didn't even notice. I brought it to her attention and said that we were full and to go ahead and cancel it. Her response was \"okay\". I'm not sure if she took it off the bill, I didn't check which is a very bad habit that I have. I will give them the benefit of a doubt and will say it was an off day. Other than that, I will go again. I would have given it 5 stars.   Great food and great view.",

Our first choice for dinner was booked out a month, so we fell back on our trusty old friend, sushi. This restaurant did not disappoint. My boyfriend made a reservation (just to be safe). We get there and we are promptly seated in the back room; the windows behind our table looked out over the strip. Everything was prompt - the service and the time frame in between ordering our drinks and food and those getting to the table. Not to mention the service was so friendly - for some reason, they speak in rather quiet tones, which normally would frustrate me (I'm mostly deaf) but for some reason, it contributed more to the already soothing atmosphere. It was very intimate and peaceful. My boyfriend got some sashimi, soup, and rolls (forget what, exactly) while I got a little bowl of rice and rolls. The food was great! Normally, I'd go into much more detail, but I'll just leave it at that and let you find out how good it is. Dessert (mochi) was also good, three flavors of your choosing and one piece (which is then halved) of each flavor. I appreciated this, so I could indulge my sweet tooth but not feel overwhelmed/too full from it. Overall, this is a romantic and peaceful restaurant, equally good for couples as well as groups. We went early (6 PM) so this probably helped out with the peacefulness a lot, but nonetheless, I highly recommend it.",

Tempura consisted of one shrimp split in quarters and you only get two skimpy quarters of that one shrimp. Nada mas.  My sushi box should have had four slices of sashimi, but what they did, they took one piece of tuna and split it in four pieces. So the four slices are paper thin and see through! It also came with beef, which was overcooked and not good.  I was still hungry and went ahead and ordered a sushi roll. It was decent size but not great tasting.  They should be ashamed of serving such food for such price. But even if it was cheap, which it wasn't, they should be ashamed, you don't serve two quarters of a shrimp as your tempura.",

We ordered a sampling of items.. we had The shrimp dim sum, which was the best item we ordered.  Does anyone else think thats funny?  The best item was a chinese dish.. haha  We ordered chicken yakitori which was pretty good but kind of overly yuzu'd up.   Way too overpowering on some bites.  We ordered a scallop dynamite which was ok, again overpowered by a flavor, which this time was the bonita flakes on top.  And halfway through eating it you could see oil puddling at the bottom of the dish, signaling we should be done and we were.  Last and least we ordered the Spicy Tuna crunchy roll (or something to that effect)  It was undercooked on the tempura outside, yet somehow overcooked on the Tuna inside.  Once this got a little cold it was disgusting... Strike 3.  Price is outrageous really for the quality of food and quality of service.

No complaints from anybody about the food, but the only issue we had was our i'm-better-than-you waiter who served us. Definitely talked down to us and tried to make us order the more expensive sake, the more expensive rolls, and another appetizer of the already expensive kobe beef. But even the annoying waiter couldn't keep us from enjoying our food and the restaurant.  For the four of us that ate there, the bill came to about $250. Luckily we were there for work, so it wasn't actually our money we were spending. Might not have enjoyed the place as much otherwise.  The table next to us had a man in his late-60s or early 70s flanked by two busty girls in their late-20s or early-30s. We tried to figure that relationship out. Ah, Vegas.",

The meat eater chose the Japanese Kobe Wagyu dish which almost made me wish I got that instead of sushi and his wife chose the Chilean Sea Bass dish..... beautiful presentation on both.    As for the sushi goers:  Blue Fin Tuna, I've never had it before, fresh and amazing!  All of the basics... Toro, Yellowtail, Salmon, Snapper, Halibut, Eel, etc.  (Don't hate my review because I'm using the American names... I don't want to screw up the spelling......) and then the rolls.....Spicy Tuna, Spicy California, Rainbow Roll, Caterpillar Roll.....mmmmmm.mmmmmm Good!  This was an excellent dinner......the server was really upbeat and even did a sake bomb with us!  Next time I'm in Sin City I'm definitely coming back to Roku.",

The yellowtail and fresh scallops were succulent.  The presentation was nice and the cocktails... quite inventive.   Okay, I guess we made up.  This will be my go-to sushi place in Vegas.

Cool, dark, trendy decor overlooking the strip - perfect for a dinner date or group dinner. Feels like you stepped into a different world from the shopping mall exterior - well, cause you technically did.  Expect to spend $50 min for some food (enough to make you full but ready for late night pizza later) and A drink. My sushi combo - spicy tuna roll and about 7 basic nigiri was about $28, glass of Rombauer chard was $18. Yes, a little pricey on the wine, but oh well, it's Vegas.  A fair comparison to this place is Sushi Samba in the Venetian...Would I go back? Sure, if it were suggested. No, if I had my choice. Too many other places to check out in Vegas!",

In terms of the food and atmosphere, it was great! For an appetizer we ordered the edamame hummus which came with chips (although not enough and when we asked for just a few more chips, when we got the bill they charged us $3 for extra chips - not cool - you should tell us there is going to be a charge first). We also ordered the cod and the spider roll - both extremely good!

The sushi rolls were good, but certainly not the best I have had (Crystal Fish in Monterey, CA is still # 1 for me).

Nice ambiance, but for the prices, I would go somewhere more upscale and that takes more risks, like Nobu. Also it was a birthday and I told 4 people but they still forgot to bring my husband the desert and sparkler to the table.....I ended up having to remind them and they served it to him in the bar on the way out...pretty lame but better than nothing.

I went with a sashimi app ($26 for eight pieces) and a spicy tuna roll (with add ons).   I agree that it was overpriced, but the service and location were stellar. I do wish they'd had a larger selection of specialty rolls.  The fish was of seriously impressive quality - it was worth my one-time cheat.   Back to vegetarianism, now and forever!",

It did take a while for us to get our check, but I'm assuming it's because most people will loiter there after their meal.  The goods:  I had a steak teriyaki something or other.  It was good.  I guess I'm a little indifferent because people rave about this place, but I don't remember experiencing anything ethereal about it.  Still though, it wasn't bad.  I'm really picky and bias about my sushi, so again, not really wow'd.  As far as sushi goes, I could stand to eat it again.  My dessert was fantastic, but you can't go wrong with a molten chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream.  And my friend got the fruit mix with different dipping sauce.  Never heard of a kiwi dipping sauce, very unique.  It was sweet and delicate, very tasty.   The atmosphere: This is where it got good.  I loved the decor.  I did manage to trip on the round stones, but that's more my fault than the restaurants.  I liked the dark tones and wood and modern yet aged feel.  It was very pretty.  I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't bad.  I wouldn't mind going back, we had a nice view and a nice meal, but I don't think I'd plan my next get-together there.",

We were sat at an great table next to an exquisite view of the Las Vegas strip. It was very romantic, the crowd was very hip, and the attire was semi-casual. We ordered the truffle edamame (definite recommendation) and 3 rolls of sushi to split. Don't bother going to Kabuki or any second rate sushi place because the sushi here is delicious!

    "text": "This is a very belated review as we were there in May of 2015. I meant to write a review immediately and got lazy. I had researched with the help of yelp to find good places to eat while in Vegas with my hubby. I worked in a sushi bar run by a very meticulous Japanese sushi master, with amazing standards, for 10 years, so I am quite particular in regard to sushi and Japanese cuisine. I saw that Roku had a great happy hour deal. We went and you sit in the bar area. There were tables but we sat right at the bar. The bartender, Tyson, and a waitress, I think her name was Emily, and a runner, who was super knowledgeable about all the dishes she served us. We had the Garden Salad, the Rib Eye Wrapped Asparagus (not me, as I do not eat beef or pork), the Mushroom Tempura with Creamy Truffle Miso, TWO orders of Tuna Tataki, Albacore Tataki and also the Spicy Tuna and Cucumber  Avocado rolls. I had sake and my hubby had a big tall bottle of mineral water, some brand from France. All of these dishes cost from $3-7. Tyson was very nice and personable and gave great recommendations, as well as giving us some personal background, which was interesting, and background about the restaurant owners and the professionalism and authenticity of the chefs. After a very decadent meal and drinks, our bill was $60, and with tip under $100. Definitely a great deal on the strip in Las Vegas! Not only that, but it was one of those meals that leaves you craving to go back to experience those flavors again. I would go back to Vegas just for a Roku!",

We were seated in a booth, which I think is the way to go (although the tables near the ceiling to wall glass windows with a view of the strip lights seemed nice too).  The noise level was low to start the night, but gradually got rowdy-- you could definitely tell that some of the tables were downing liquid courage.  SERVICE: Our waitress was super cute/friendly, but did mess up our drink order once.  The GM stopped by our table to say hello, but it didn't seem like we got any special treatment.  FOOD: Average.  I think there was either a set menu, or a previously decided upon order, since our food started arriving course by course as soon as our drink orders were taken.  - edamame: Sprinkled lightly with sea salt, I was disappointed the seasoning wasn't evenly distributed.  It also seemed strange that a seemingly nice place like Sushi Roku would charge for edamame (or include it as one of the charged for courses in a set menu). - Hamachi carpaccio (1 slice of fish/person): Eh.  Also slightly disappointing.  The flavors were good (yuzu drizzle, etc), but the fish could've been fresher.  The girls really liked this dish though, so maybe its just me. - Filet mignon wrapped asparagus (1 roll/person): Presentation was nice-- the rolls were stacked up on each other on top of a sizzling rock.  A soy glaze was poured on top before serving, and emitted an impressive amount of steam.  I ended up with a piece that was sitting on top of the rock-- the meat was fairly tough for a supposedly tender cut.  I'm also not a huge fan of asparagus, so this dish was meh for me. - Crispy miso shrimp (several shrimps/person): My fave of the night, but it was essentially honey walnut prawns, minus the sweet mayo. - Chicken & beef teriyaki skewers (1 of each skewer/person): The beef skewers featured nice tender chunks of beef.  The chicken wasn't as good as the beef imo, but at least they were juicy and not dry. - Assortment of sushi (a couple pieces of sushi/person): Eh.  Par. - Dessert trio: Cheesecake (thumbs down; it had a REALLY hard buttery crust), cinnamon sugar donut \"holes\" (good, very fluffy, came with caramel and vanilla dipping sauces), and a molten chocolate lava cake (very good, very lava-y).  The cocktails were hit or miss, but I really liked the bourbon one with cilantro and raspberries.  OVERALL: Solid 3 stars.  I actually have no idea how much the meal cost, so my rating may change after I see the bill.  Anything more than $40pp would be too much for what we ate.",

The only thing that wasn't stellar was our server, but she was OK, so we left her 15% all the same.  This place is on the third floor of Caesar's Forum shops next store to BOA.  a) Foie Gras topped scallops $21 AWESOME, we ordered another round of these they were that good b) yellowtail and jalapeno sashimi platter really good and lots of it c) lychee martinis --yum yum d) Great view of the Las Vegas strip :)  e) regular sushi rolls very good as well f) great music g) nice ambiance h) availability to book online quickly makes me happy too!",

    "text": "One of the best sushi restaurants in Vegas.  Rolls are a bit pricey but are very creative and have much more fish than most of the other \"fine dining\" sushi restaurants on the strip.   We had the Katana rolls which consisted of Tuna and Yellowtail on top of a roll with spicy tuna and shrimp tempura, these were fantastic, the shrimp was perfectly tender and the flavors worked well together.  Also had the crunchy spicy tuna with avocado which was perfect. And the spicy scallop roll which we really enjoyed.  I was quite hungry and wanted something hot so we tried the Chicken Yakitori  skewers, awesome, and the Kobe Beef skewers, alright but not as good as I would have hoped.  Service was excellent and the bar makes some very innovative cocktails, I am not much of a cocktail drinker myself but my better half ordered the Tokyo Cooler which I tried as well and agree with her opinion that it was fantastic.  Tab was just over $160 with three rolls, the chicken and kobe skewers, a shared dessert, two cocktails, and a couple beers. Not bad for Vegas.",

    "text": "Fresh, good sushi...in the desert? Call me skeptical, but yes, this is Vegas, after all. In the heart of Caesar's Forum Shoppes, the three curving escalators to ride to get here make it seem more exclusive than it is, but enjoy.  This place is all about three things: decor, wide selection of modern interpretation of Japanese cusisine, and overly friendly service. Let's get it out of the way: the place is beautiful. Very modern, very rich, and dark, it's a visual treat. Set against the overlook of the Strip (so, why DO people go to Imperial Palace?), it's a visual masterpiece. The bench seats that line the windows actually have lit rock gardens underneath them...very cool.  The food: good, but won't wow you into submission. I'm just a spoiled San Francisco sushi man, so it might be amazing for others. The Chicken Kara Age was exceptional, however; highly reccomended. The sushi? The sushi itself was good: fresh, flavorful. The rolls were overstuffed with so many things, it was hard to get a sense of the delicate flavor. Be warned: you are paying Vegas prices here ($100 for 2 of us with about 5 small plates), but the quality and ambience are good enough to overcome that.  Service was almost obsequious, although getting tea refilled seemed to be a foreign concept. Hey, I know the desert's hot, but I can't have my hamachi without some tea to go with it. ;-) Very prompt delivery of items, very courteous.   Odd notes: the place was only half full for an 8pm reservation. We used Open Table to ensure a seat, but we needn't have worried. And a note if you plan to sit by the windows: there is a typical Vegas video sign just underneath the restaurant outside, so you'll get a lot of flickering glow, which can be distracting.  I'd say it's a good casual sushi place, to take a date, or to enjoy the fun of being in Vegas without killing you on price with no quality to show for it.",

All very friendly, and skilled. Jason taught me all about soy paper haha.   The fish is all good. Bomb ass uni, but the baked crab roll was my drug of choice lately.  Way too good for $11.  I ate 45 of them lol, jk. 12oz of hot sake for $10. Good skewers as well. Really I don't think you can go wrong here. It's really very good bang for your buck here. I've had omakase a while back and it's was really beautiful and delicious. Good salmon nigiri, hella good snapper,  real wasabi, etc.. it's all good here.   Good loud bar in back but it's not part of sushi roku. But roku has its own bar as well. Really good service maybe they like me extra but the hosts, waitresses and chefs and everyone are very intelligent and helpful and super nice to me!",

The other way is cooked in the kitchen, on the same grill they use to cook yakitori over binchotan and three ounces. We opted for the table side so we could watch the spectacle of cooking it, but not before we asked several questions about binchotan wood. Afterwards, in between other plates being brought to our table the server took the time to bring a cut of binchotan wood out for us to see and understand why it's so great for grilling (no flames, but hot consistent temperature that is long lasting). For me, that was above and beyond what she had to do, and was really impressed with her overall service. It was only our second time there, but we will definitely be back again soon. It doesn't hurt that almost everything that came out of the kitchen was cooked or prepared to perfection.",

Try smiling while you're at work, not telling me your back hurts and you can't wait to get off.  Also, quick tip - don't order the red wine that's on happy hour.

Brussel Sprouts with Bacon and Yuzu Kosho: 5 out of 5 stars (it's BACON!)  For Entrees and Special Rolls, we ordered:  Uni Udon Creamy Pasta: this was actually more like fettuccini, not udon noodles. It was definitely very creamy and heavy. I liked it, but I wouldn't say it was my favorite dish of the night. 3 out of 5 stars. Well, let's make it 4 out of 5 stars, since the uni pieces were huge. Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus: it comes on a hot rock. 4 out of 5 stars. Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll (this is typically deep fried, but there is an option to just get the deep fried crunchy flakes on top of the roll). 4 out of 5 stars. Katana Roll: Spicy tuna & shrimp tempura topped with tuna and yellowtail. 5 out of 5 stars. Makoto Roll: Yellowtail & shrimp tempura wrapped with seared tuna, spicy creamy sauce. 5 out of 5 stars. These rolls were pretty similar actually...oops.  The other side ordered the Prime Rib Eye Steak to share, and we each tried a piece. If I go with a large group again, we are ordering that fosheezy.",

    "text": "Sushi Roku is the most amazing Japanese high quality restaurant I have been to in Vegas. The 8 years plus I have spent in Las Vegas I haven't been to a better sushi bar. The food although a bit pricey is well worth the investment. Sushi Roku is located in the forum shops located right next to Caesars Palace. This restaurant is located on the third floor which contains a variety of fashion stores to enjoy after your meal.  The appetizer i started with was the lobster Tempura for the price of $35.00. The meat of the lobster came from the the tail very juicy and delicious. The lobster was chopped into nuggets with a sweet and golden miso glaze. The first bite made me think I struck gold with this one. The baked crab hand-roll was my next appetizer and it did not disappoint me. This little morsel was $11.00 classically made with lobster,rice, and butter wrapped in soy paper. This like the lobster tempura had very juicy succulent lobster in it.  Then, I went on to my entree... the best steak ever. The uniquely delicious prime rib-eye steak  \"JAPONAIS\" was a meat lovers dream at the price of $48.00. The steak I chose was medium rare it was very tender and garnished with tomatoes. The sides included Japanese style potatoes in a delicious sauce and mini wedge shaped.Lastly, this dish included garlic green beans and a delicious garlic sauce that would make A1 cry.  Last but not least, the chocolate lava cake that blew my mind. The minute I took my spoon and cut into this chocolate volcano, chocolate flowed out. Their was also a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and a small cookie. The combination of all three would satisfy anyone after a 3 course meal.  The end of my meal included a birthday surprise for one of my family members. The staff brought my aunt a free creme brulee and brought a wine glass with a sparkler. The fireworks show was the fork in the steak and made the meal wrap up splendidly. Definitely a great destination for a birthday or any other sort of get together.   This is my first post on Yelp! and well I hope you enjoyed it. Lets see where my taste buds take me next...Talk to you soon!",

The name of the sushi I got was sushi UME it said in the menu \" Roku signature style sushi \" \" our master sushi chef's custom creations \"  not even close to that. Money is not an issue for me but I feel like I'm stupid of paying something not even worth to pay for. I recommend to go to Mizumi or Sushi Samba",

We ordered a lot -- miso soup, fried calamari, the senshi roll and the spicy scallop roll. My favorite was the fried calamari, which has some jalapeno sauce so it's a unique addition to your traditional calamari!  The senshi roll is very rich and filling, and we were already full by the time it came out so we had to box it to go. Very tasty though!  A great spot at the top floor of the Forum Shops. Service was quick and friendly!",

    "text": "MEH. Anyone who gave it a 5-star probably gives Red Lobster a 5-star. They don't know food.   Reservations aren't guaranteed, even if you make them directly through them or Open Table. You will still have to wait. Be prepared for 40+ minute wait after reservation time. Very loud atmosphere. Tables spill out into a mall next to a Planet Hollywood. Not recommended for business for sure, if considering. Maybe better for bar atmosphere maybe if you like standing 3-layers behind people to get to bar. Don't go during a conference.   Sushi was over nitrated, so hard to say if it was \"fresh\", but also had mush texture. It is sushi in landlocked desert Las Vegas though, so no sushi will be that fresh. Prices over inflated, but it's Vegas, so to be expected. Dish descriptions didn't quite match quality/expectations. Everything was overtly drenched and drowned in mixed flavors to cover nitrated sushi. Drinks weak and on sweet side. Not balanced. Meh.   Waiter was very good, gracious, and apologized for the wait. He was the only redeeming factor.  Great guy. Tommy C is fantastic. Applaud him.   $300 dollars later for 4 people, 3 rolls, 3 small apps, 4 pieces sashimi, 3 cocktails, 1 beer. Spend your money elsewhere and read the reviews thoroughly. Don't be fooled by reservation availability!   Meh.",

We ordered the Cruncy Spicy Tuna Tempura Roll w/Avocado and a Baked Crab Hand Roll (soy paper)--Both excellent!!! Sadly, the Edamame was on the bland side.  Located on 3rd Level of the Forum Shops at Cesars Palace--fair pricing, great view of the Strip, hip music & romantic. We can't wait to go back!!!

    "text": "Location/Ambiance: Sushi Roku sits on prime real-estate. Located on the 3rd floor of caesar's forum shops (east-wing), Sushi Roku offers their guests a stellar view of the Vegas strip. Elegant and tasteful decor pair well with the romantic and warm atmosphere of the restaurant.   Food: Everything I ordered throughout the night either met or exceeded my expectations. Here are a few of my favorites: The Beef Ribeye Wrapped Asparagus is relatively simple but very delicious - the full flavor of savory beef was well balanced with a properly cooked asparagus center (plus 10 points for the great presentation on a hot rock!). The Filet Mignon Tobanyaki has to be one of the most flavorful dishes at Sushi Roku. A garlic-truffle ponzu sauce made this vegetable-filet medley very complex and addicting till the last bite. Lastly, the Yellowtail Diced Chiles is OUTSTANDING. The rich oils dress the fresh yellowtail impeccably - give it a shot!  Service: Definitely saved the best for last in this review. I've been to Sushi Roku three or four times in the last year, and each experience left me thoroughly impressed with regards to quality of service. My most recent dining experience, in particular, was incredible. My GF and I were celebrating our 2 year anniversary, and our waitress, Maiko, helped make our special dinner an unforgettable one. Her knowledge of the menu was impressive - providing great food and wine recommendations, but her warmth and positive energy really made the experience for us. Ask for Maiko if you dine at Sushi Roku and you are guaranteed to have a great experience.",

Tried two happy hour rolls and one tempura  spicy tuna roll. The tempura oddly enough tasted stale/old just not good at all. The other rolls one with rock shrimp and one with scallops. I didn't really care for the rock shrimp one like eat one piece and done. The scallop one wasnt awful. Overall really unimpressed. The bar tender was nice on a positive note.",

Despite being located in an upscale section of a \"mall - \"Forum at Caesar's Palace, the dark, rich wood, ponds with koi, multi-leveled seating (booths and platforms) and the warm lighting made this place irresistable to not walk into during a break in my shopping frenzy. This place had the hints of a warm romantic restaurant with the modern edge that made dining here accessible to all.  No matter where you are sitting (even if you aren't near a window) you'll enjoy the view.  I was ready for a huge meal and my dining partner and I (having walked from MGM) were ready for a giant meal.  We took the server's suggestion of a Tokyo Breeze (a sake cocktail).  It was amazing!  Perfectly balanced - not-too-sweet citrus cocktail made from sake, to this day, as not found it's equal in ANY establishment i have been to.  It was amazing..  Starter: Chilean Sea Bass Eggrolls- I think this has forever changed my view on eggrolls.  The buttery flavor of the Chilean Sea bass was perfect with this dish.  The tender fish paired with the crispy wonton skin... amazing.  Sushi: Uni - Delicious! Salmon - tAMAZING! the server mentioned that this was suggested by the chef because I had ordered so much salmon sashimi (it was a special kind - i can't remember, but had thicker bands of the delicious fat and was a more deeply hued orange than what I am used to)  Eel- (freshwater) it was prefectly sauced with great consistency.  The slices of fish were well matched size-wise with the perfectly seasoned rice  Sashimi: Salmon, Yellowtail, and Tuna - all were delicious!  Rolls: The rice was NOT smashed into the nori and the balance of all the flavors were perfectly matched! We had the Kani Kani roll because we are crab lovers!  A roll done with crab 2 ways - inside (Alaskan snow crab) and outside - fried/tempura!  Delicious. there was a great selection of rolls that seemed to cover everything from the extremely lavish to the simple but delicious.. TRY them all!  Service was extremely helpful, prompt and polite.  They were very attentive when we needed them and magically disappeared when they were no longer needed.. its that 6th sense that great servers are known for.. Sushi Roku servers had it.  This will be pricer than what you are used to, but it is every bit worth it.",

First: it took us close to 20/25 minutes to find this place after entering Caesar's and asking several hotel employees. *No, we weren't drunk or stoned; it's that hidden. Second: When we did finally arrive to the hostess stand and nobody else was around, they both just stared at us. We said hello and that we had a reservation. One of them lead us to a table right next to a table of ladies and all their bags. We looked around the empty restaurant and asked if we could possibly be sat a bit farther away. Done with hesitation. Third: I eat fish/seafood but, my husband doesn't but, can usually find something on any menu. I asked our waitress what she recommended for both of us given the no fish deal. She suggested a shrimp dish. ??? My food came first while we waited for my husband's. This is the fault of our waitress by misfiring the order to the kitchen;  any good waitperson knows all food for the table should come relatively around the same time. The sushi was good; they have ankimo!! The best? No way! For $200 (no booze) I expect much better than good. I think the most insulting was being charged $3 for extra \"pita\" pieces when we wanted more than the 4 slices the hummus originally came with. On a completely personal bitchy note: our waitress' grill was all over the place (possibly missing teeth, jagged, crowded) and very distracting when looking at her. Her appearance didn't match the chic/trendy look this place is going for. As a local, we probably won't go back anytime soon.",

As a super sushi lover, it is extremely rare that I am impressed with the quality of sushi the way I was with Sushi Roku. Growing up my parents owned their own sushi restaurant and I am confident when I say.. I know my fish. I don't know or understand how they manage to always have the freshest quality of fish despite the fact that LV is in the middle of a desert but I hope they keep it up.. forever.   Servers are helpful, kind, and knowledgeable of the menu. If you don't know where to start, ask them for their thoughts and they'd definitely help you. I highly recommend the Shima Roll but to be really honest, it seems that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The price range tends to be on the higher end but hey, you're in vegas--the city of excess/riches and you're in a desert yet you are being served fresh fish.. what did you expect? And as I've said, the quality and taste is as good as it gets.   If you are a sushi lover, I recommend that you give this place a go!",

    "text": "After staying in Las Vegas for a few days, we wanted to try something outside of the buffet line, so we turned to Yelp to help us find a nice sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. Sushi Roku came up with moderate views and we have been noticing quite a bit of advertisement for them around the Strip. Every sign we saw was promoting them as \"The most romantic spot in Las Vegas\". And Sushi Roku could have pass for the most romantic spot too. Their decor was fantastic and their tables near the window had an amazing view of the Strip.  However, the food was simply horrible, not to mention expensive. I know I am paying for the ambience so I wouldn't have mind if the food would have tasted half as good as it look, but it was barely edible. Everything felt dry and was seriously, lacking flavor. They didn't even use the Japanese short grain rice that is known for its stickiness. Instead, we were given a bowl of dry long grain, possibly day old rice. A small bite of the rice was more than I could handle and ended up finishing the meal without it.  Sushi Roku looks amazing and could be a very romantic spot to take your date to, just as long as you don't eat the food. Order some drinks or hot tea and enjoy the ambience and view.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flwehttam.wordpress.com%2F2011%2F02%2F20%2Fsushi-roku%2F&s=96136d13627e529fb21c9c758a91546e713c2e603b25c20a182d06bcbb8a7f97\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lwehttam.wordpress.com/2...</a>",

They have gluten free soy sauce and they have gluten free rolls which makes it really easy to order. The fish was so fresh and delicious. The ambience of the restaurant was very nice with the dimmed lighting, strip view, and great decor.

But I walked out feeling like an idiot for paying what I did for what I got.  Eighteen bucks for spicy tuna with shrimp, cilantro, and avocado?  Ouch.  It did have 10 pieces, but they were the size of one of those budget happy hour California rolls you get for 3 or 4 bucks at a normal sushi place.  The baked lobster roll only had 6 pieces, barely fit for an appetizer (and the asparagus spear inside was about half of the volume of the interior of the roll).   The 4 star stuff.... The view of the strip was pretty sweet, although it was predominated by the Caesar's Palace TV thing.  The decor was nice, very dark and trendy/classy.  The service was great, they were very attentive and even brought out some cheesecake for my friend's birthday.  The fish was very fresh (impressive, being in the middle of the dessert) and everything tasted very good.  Simple, elegant flavors with a lot of attention to presentation.  The sake selection was extensive and had a decently priced and very good house sake and a 3-sake tasting flight with big pours.    The funny thing is, I'd come back.  It's hard to find good sushi and even though I felt pretty dang close to being ripped off, this was good sushi.  I'll probably try some other places nearby first.  Oh, and this would be a fantastic date place.",

Call ahead and make sure Kichi is the chef that night.  Every course is like heaven.  Comes to about $90/per person not including alcohol and would gladly spend that again anytime my friends want a fantastic sushi dinner on the strip.",

    "text": "On our girls trip to Vegas this past weekend, we were craving something other than the typical Vegas quick-fix like burgers and tacos. Instead, we literally took a journey down Las Vegas Blvd, through Caesar's casino, through the Forum Shoppes to get to our destination.  We were quickly led to a table that overlooked Las Vegas Blvd. This restaurant is gorgeous and one of the best decorated Japanese restaurants I've been to. Even their bathroom is art in itself. Us 5 girls sat in one of the leather booths in the middle of the main dinning hall. 4 of us ordered the lunch special of teriyaki salmon with tempura or sashimi that came with a side of miso soup, salad, and rice (about $17-$19), and the last lady ordered 2 sushi rolls (their rolls vary from $12-$30). We had 2 large hot sakes which gave us girls about 4 shots each. Don't waste your money here because those shots did absolutely NOTHING! For $9 a bottle, put your money towards a Fat Tuesday drink instead.  The salmon, tempura, miso soup, and rolls were pretty good. However the salad was a different story. For a salad that took up almost half a plate, why did it feel like only 2 spoonfuls of dressing was mixed in? I'm not a dinosaur. I don't eat grass and plants and greens by itself. Yuck.   Our bill for lunch came out to $125. Luckily we were only 5 because like all major restaurants, 18% gratuity is added to a party of 6 or more. If you're looking to spend around $30 for one of their special sushi rolls, come here. Other than that, look for a better lunch special elsewhere.",

We had a couple different types of spicy rolls along with some yellow tail tuna sashimi which was incredible. We also had some raw kobe beef, yakatori and some tempura seafood which was also fantastic. Even the little bowl of miso soup I had was exceptional. We sat right at the windows with an incredible view of the strip. You will pay the price for this level of quality and surroundings but as a special occasion sushi place, I would certainly go again.

    "text": "DON'T DO IT!  You're in Vegas, looking for a dining hot spot, and you're gonna be tempted to buy into the the Sushi Roku hype.  Don't do it!  I'm usually skeptical of people who give a place 1 star - I mean how bad could it have been if a sophisticated Yelper went there in the first place, right?  But I have NO idea how this place has 4 stars: there is nothing special AT ALL about the food, the service was pretty poor, and the prices are outrageous.  I've figured out why people go here - there's very little sushi competition in Vegas.  But that doesn't mean it deserves 4 stars.  I think Vegas restaurants must beget a chicken-head lemming syndrome (i.e. girls who didn't pay for the meal highlighting that they have wealthy boyfriends who take them to Vegas headline spots in order to impress their \"friends\" on Yelp).  I hope I'm wrong, but I don't think I am.  A group of us ordered a wide variety of a ton of food there this past weekend for dinner on Saturday night.  I personally tried a few pieces from the Chef's sashimi selection, the braised pork belly, and a couple rolls (crab dynamite and tempura shrimp).  The fish was fresh and tasty, but that's to be expected right?  To me, that's just securing fresh inventory via reliable transportation, so the credit should go to the inventory buyer, not the chef.  While I realize that rolls are the good-intentioned, but unaccomplished cousin in a good sushi restaurant, shouldn't they be pretty easy to make fairly enjoyable?  These were entirely forgettable.  The pork belly was well prepared from a cooking standpoint, but was gaudily overseasoned with ginger, which everone knows can easily overpower a dish.  Another point that irked me was that we made a 9:30PM reservation after a Cirque show.  We showed up early, waited an hour, then were given 2 separate tables for 12 people, despite having requested one large table for our group.  We declined the two tables and waited a while longer to be seated at a clearing large table.  I usually don't mind being split up, but in this case ppl had flown from all over the country to meet in Vegas 1 year after graduating from b-school - we wanted to sit together, and weren't asked about being split up.  The food took FOREVER to order and FOREVER to come.  The waitstaff noticed how long it took, so they brought our group 4 free desserts, which was a nice gesture, but only delayed them bringing the check and prolonged a dinner that took 3.5 hours and killed the rest of our night in which we were planning to drop in on a lounge.  To summarize: Minus one star: Food flavor Minus one star: Service (our servers had great attitudes, but at a place like this, execution is what counts, not intentions) Minus one star: Value (I don't mind paying a premium for great food, service, and overall experience...but this wasn't any of those) Minus one star: overall poor experience from waiting one hour despite being early for our reservation to having post-dinner plans nixed due to slow service.  Would not recommend to anyone and would not return...can forgo sushi/japanese in Vegas and just get it here in LA.",

The menu is quite large, with some traditional items, fancy, unhealthy rolls, as well as a couple of entrees as well. I tried the kobe beef skewers that was a bit overcooked to me. Perhaps that was their take on it, but I definitely think that kobe is best cooked to the minimal. I was not too impressed. The slow cooked pork dish with rice however, was delicious! The pork was so tender and the sauce was amazing. I would definitely have that dish again! Great view of the strip as well, and the service was decent but not the best. Pricing is decent for a nicer restaurant like this. Solid 3 stars.",

Because from 4-6 every day at Sushi Roku, you can pretend that you're a high roller, order a large Kirin beer, a spicy tuna roll, a shrimp tempura and jalapeno roll, an order of spicy prawns and chips, and a mini chocolate volcano cake off the Happy Hour menu.

I was warmly greeted by a young lady in which I mentioned that I would be dining alone and would like a view of the strip.  DONE!

He kept coming around to make sure that I liked my dish and we got to chit chat a little about the food.   (I don't eat raw fish often but in this case I figure I'd try it and see if it was fresh)  I'm glad I did. My sushi was topped with Tuna that was yummy and fresh. I also informed him that I don't like too much jalapeno's  so he made sure it was on the side rather than wrapped in my sushi.  The miso soup was tasty and very flavorful and I washed it down with a Blue Moon.

My sister and I dined here for a girls night and they took such great care of us. We got a seat with a view, when it was packed. The manager comped our dessert, just cause. Literally, I would give them 10 stars if I could. It seemed like the type of place to take care of their regulars, and locals.  A couple of the dishes that stood out to me were the Jumbo Shrimp, and King Crab fried rice.  The shrimp was served with potato style chips, and a creamy sauce. I am still wondering what was in that sauce. It had a savory, yet sweet honey butter flavor. So delicious.  The crab fried rice just hit the spot. There were huge chunks of crab, and the dish was packed with flavor. No need to add soy or hot sauce to this one.  There were a dozen or so sushi options, and a variety of small sharable plates, or full size entrees.  Park valet at the Forum Shops to avoid the tourist traffic. From food, to service, and even price, I was highly impressed all around. I can't wait to return.",

We were promptly seated and we ordered the Karaage appetizer, the Teriyaki salmon, and the beef Teriyaki.  All the dishes were good and they came with sashimi.  I got to say, the sashimi was good, though I didn't have high expectations as this was Vegas...and not hear the coast.  It did take a bit of time to get our food, but it was forgivable.    Verdict: I would go back if and when I go back to Vegas.  Though I'm sure there are other good places to go too.",

Our food: Filet Mignon with Ginger Teriyaki Sauce, Japanese style potatoes, sauteed garlic beans: it was cooked perfect to medium rare, hubby liked the sauce, I liked the beans.   Miso soup: nothing special, it was OK  Premium sashimi (10 pc): they were very fresh and tasty, loved it.   Our friends food: 3 orders of albacore, baked lobster roll, California roll: I tried a little bit of each dish, they were yummy, but nobody liked the baked lobster roll too much, a little too creamy for our taste. They couldn't even finish their food, kept asking me to eat more. No problem, I love sushi too much.   The food was delicious, service was great, plus the amazing views, a very pleasant double dinner date, we enjoyed it so much.   I am a big fan of sushi Roku, it never disappoints!",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about Sushi Roku.  It's not the best, nor the worst experience I've had.  I guess if I had to sum them up in one word, it would be mediocre.  My gf and I went to Sushi Roku on our first day in Vegas.  The two of us have had omakase at some of the best restaurants NYC has to offer.  We've been to Nobu, Nakazawa, Gari, and Akio.  Seeing that Roku offered omakase made us excited as we wanted to add another feather in our cap of excellent sushi, but in truth it was a bit of a dud.  The omakase is six courses, really just three sandwiched between an appetizer and a dessert.  The appetizer was an interesting salad, the dessert was a strawberry shortcake thing that you could likely find at a local diner, and the three sushi courses were more or less forgettable.  I'd like to give you more details, but honestly that's all you need to know.  There was no ah-ha moment were I thought that they had created something special.  I can't honestly say that it was bad though and had we not previously experienced some of the most amazing sushi you could eat, we might have been more impressed.  The one highlight of Roku was the service.  We had a great sushi chef and a great server.  Our server really went the extra mile and gave us some help in finding the perfect place to watch fireworks on the 4th of July.  Additionally, the beer and spirit offerings were great.  I had a fantastic rice beer that I wish I remembered the name.  Go to Sushi Roku, just don't have the omakase.  It's not worth the price.  You'll have a good time though.",

    "text": "This was a fantastic meal in an excellent setting.  There was a group of 6 of us eating, so we had several dishes.  The service was excellent, as we never had to wait long for new items once the food started rolling in.  Although we had primarily sushi, the star of the dish for me was the wagyu beef.  For $60, you get 6 strips of melt in your mouth steak that you cook at your table on a hot rock.  Just a dip in a soy sauce based sauce, a few seconds on the hot pot, and you are set.  The mouth feel was \"melt in your mouth,\" the fat breaking down and the steak seemed to melt as you chewed it.  The flavor was off the charts, all agreed.  It was a great way to get a couple of bites of such an excellent piece of beef and not totally break the bank.  As I stated, we had many dishes, the standouts were the yellowtail sashimi, the crab dynamite, and a tempura shrimp roll that was a special, but I can't recall its name.  This one had a lot of spice to it, and the tempura was fantastic.  Not greasy in the slightest.  The makato roll was such a favorite we ordered another.  We tried the baked lobster roll which for me was decent, but not nearly as good as the other items we ordered.  The wife had the sauteed spicy shrimp.  They make this dish out to be spicier than it really is.  It has a nice sauce on top that has a little sweetness.  The real star of this dish was the housemade potato chips.  They went very well with the creamy sauce.  Very solid drink menu with a lot of Asian beers, which is typically my preferred drink at sushi places.  The view, as many have noted, is great of the strip.  But, if you don't want to watch cars or random people walking, you can certainly sit in areas of the restaurant that don't have the view.  Will definitely return, and highly recommended.",

They have a new tuna tare tare that has a crispy dough cup that has now replaced the infamous old tuna tare tare and let me tell you it pales in comparison to the old recipe.  We requested to have the old recipe made but to our shock sushi chef said no it can't be done. I thought wow! Since when does Sushi Roku NOT accommodate their customers even if they have all the ingredients?? Any sushi place I've been to would have done this.  It was explained to us that it's a corporate thing and they want to keep the menu the same across all locations.  IMHO this dilutes the wow factor of Sushi Roku as a top notch sushi destination.  Very disappointing as this was a signature dish that is no longer available because of a corporate strategy. This is not putting your customers first.   Service was great though.  But sadly we will not be returning to our once favorite sushi destination here in Vegas because they refuse to accommodate their customers. This place has lost its lustre.",

Very fresh and reasonably priced. The staff was phenomenal and  so attentive. I Loved  the unsweetened iced tea - it was passionfruit flavored- omg. Great ambiance. Def cozy. We had a great time there and got a beautiful picture of us there. Def recommend it and would return when Im back in sin city.",

The reason for 4* is the price. $250 for a party of two is a little pricy. If you are craving sushi and have $$$ than make sure you drop by here and enjoy.",

Went early evening with my husband and another couple and were seated immediately. It was Sunday night and pretty quiet. I ordered a dirty martini right off thebat. It was served quickly and was perfect. We decided to order some soups and a couple of rolls to start. The soup was delicious, just what I want in a miso soup. The waiter was very helpful in suggesting what rolls we might like and what looked good that evening. All were quite tasty and beautifully presented, simple but beautiful. He was very patient with us as we like to order just a couple of items at a time so as not to crowd the table or over eat. Great view of the strip as well. Prices were reasonable and I would definitely come again.",

    "text": "Sushi Roku has become one of my favorite places to go to while in vegas.  It's tucked away on the top level of the new Forum shoppes area at Caesar's. The ambiance is something special..it feels very intimate and at the same time you get a nice view of the strip.   I've dined there three times and all have been great experiences. The first was with a group of sorority sisters, the 2nd with coworkers and third with my mommy when I treated her to Celine Dion. During my first visit, the Manager (a young gentleman) came around to talk to us. We told him we were from the Bay Area and were celebrating 2 birthdays. We chatted a bit about various sushi places in the Bay..and he gave us his business card! By the end of the night, 2 'happy birthday' dessert dishes were brought to our table, compliments of the manager! During the second visit, the same manager came around again and I mentioned I had met him a few months before. At the end of the meal we discovered a nice surprise when the bill came, our dessert dish was removed from the bill! Once again, compliments of the manager. Third time, it was just me and my mom and it was just 4 months later..once again, the nice young gentleman came around and he recognized me. I told him I was back in Vegas treating my mom for her 60th birthday to watch Celine Dion in concert...and now this was the icing on the cake (literally!) ... he ordered the dessert for us and had it delivered to our table as soon as we were done with our main course.. because he didn't want us to be late for the concert!  Once again, compliments of the manager..   Now, besides all that luck (or coincidence that he is just always there when i'm there) ...the food is superb. I started to wonder how fresh seafood gets to the middle of the desert and stays fresh. But I immediately forgot about all that once I started eating at this place. Also, from my 3 experiences there I think i've tried all the dessert dishes. They're all delicious and the presentation is lovely.   Go to Sushi Roku ...and don't forget the dessert! =)",

Service was great, and presentation was lovely. Lots of high-end ingredients. I won't pretend this was cheap... its pricey, but the food was worth it. The wine menu is unfortunate... small selection, and crazy-over-priced.   If you really appreciate sushi, and are looking for tasty bites in the desert, swing through for sure. If you have the time, order the Omakase... it was so yummy!!!  oh! and the view from the booths was GREAT!",

I deciding on what to eat and was staying at Caesar's Palace and remembered that this place was in the Forum Shops at Caesar's so I decided on having lunch there. It was a Wednesday afternoon and the place was pretty empty which is a far cry from what it usually is like at night. I sat at the sushi bar and had one of their lunch combos (sashimi and tempura) and added an order of fatty tuna sushi. This was really tasty. I hadn't had sushi in a while and it really hit the spot. I also got a chance to chat with the head sushi chef, Kiichi, who was a really cool guy. I've been to the other Sushi Rokus (Santa Monica and Pasadena) but this one is my favorite. This place is highly recommended, but be prepared, it is not cheap.",

Me and my girlfriend both agreed we had the best roll (Spicy Dragon Roll)and best prime rib steak we ever tasted.  YES thats right, the best steak we have ever had was here at a Japanese restaurant.  Order the Prime Rib steak, SO juicy SO tendy SO flavorful.  Overall: Yes this place is a little pricey, but this is Las Vegas and this is not bad in comparison to other fine dining options.

Very sleek, modern interior, dark, loud modern music.  We ordered: eggplant app (yummy), pork korubata (good but fatty and not for sharing), seaweed salad, kobe beef and scallop app (beef was too chewy), california roll, unagi avocado roll, and the chicken entree (a bit dry).  The rolls were alright, nothing elaborate for their pricepoint, perhaps the nigiri/sashimi would have been better?  They had a nice assortment of small plates that we should have stuck with.",

    "text": "I'm no expert in sushi but I certainly eat a lot of it. I've been to supposedly world class sushi restaurants and regularly drop circa $200 or more on sushi for 2 before the drink tab. Sushi Roku is a solid choice. If you want to eat on the strip, definitely recommended. Unfortunately, like just about all strip restaurants, there's better in the suburbs for a whole lot less money.   Service: knowledgeable, friendly, accommodating, an asset.   Atmosphere: I'm not into a shopping mall atmosphere's but my gf liked it. Casual, as opposed to some better sushi houses that make you feel like they're doing you a favor seating you.   Food: very good ingredients, recipes (where relevant), rice (so easy to mess up) and presentation.",

The only black eye... was the crunchy spicy tuna roll was awful.  I would have given 4 stars of not for the last roll.  I'm pretty open minded when it comes to food but it really was awful in my opinion.",

I called to place the reservation and they asked if we were celebrating anything. I gave them a cursory answer about a late anniversary not expecting anything and locked in a later reservation.  We arrived and were seated immediately and they had no problem with a request for a view of the strip while we ate. The restaurant is quite and the ambiance was great. It was darker so you had more of an illusion of being alone and the server was extremely attentive!  My fiance ordered the Pork Belly Fried Rice and was smitten from her first bite. She didn't have to add any soy, a first for her! She loved ever bit and it was still good when we ate our leftovers almost 3 hours later, cold.  I had the \"Chef's Choice\" sushi platter. 8 pieces of finely crafted sushi, all with their own signature sauces. Eat bite was unctuous, delectable, and so satisfying! I couldn't remember them all, but the Uni, the Scottish Salmon & the King Crab leg were to die for!  At the end of the meal the wait staff surprised us with a complimentary chocolate lava cake that was the highlight of the meal. They even wrote Happy Anniversary on the plate, a special treat that showed they really paid attention to their customers!  We'll definitely be going back!",

I ordered the toro-jalepeno roll which was about 8 pieces.. I also ordered the spicy scallop hand roll.. I did expect the scallops to be fresh but it was cooked but still delicious! We also ordered the crispy shrimp appetizer which was sooooo good! my friend ordered the chicken fried rice and the rice was perfectly cooked and nice and soft! my friends got other rolls as well but I don't remember exactly what rolls but they said it was amazing! After words, we ordered cheesecake and mochi for dessert which was delicious as well! I would definitely come back when in town!",

    "text": "This has got to be one of the absolute best Happy Hours in Vegas - certainly the best on the Vegas Strip.  We came over after riding the High Roller...  it's very conveniently located to the Linq in the Forum Shops at Caesars.  It's on the very top floor tucked away in a corner...    HH is 4-7 on Sunday through Thursday and 4-6 on Friday and Saturday.  You can easily make a delicious meal out of their outstanding Happy Hour, which is what we did.  Skip the line and walk on into the front bar area to take advantage of the deals.  And come early - this is justifiably popular!  Cut sushi rolls are $6 (hand rolls are only $4) and I just HAD to have the shrimp tempura with asparagus - delicious.  My SO had the vegetable roll and the unusual sweet potato tempura roll, both of which she said were fabulous.  I also had the miso glazed popcorn shrimp tempura...  this is a specialty at Sushi Roku and this HH portion was large and wonderful and only $6.  The mushroom tempura with creamy truffle miso is a very similar dish, but for vegetarians.  And it is also a large portion ($5) and just as freakin fabulous as the popcorn shrimp dish.  The HH menu is just outstanding with so many reasonably priced choices in generous portions.  And a good mix of meat/seafood AND vegetarian dishes.  There are even dessert choices at HH prices.  When you throw in that champagne is $6 a glass along with all this deliciousness...  it's pretty much impossible to imagine a more perfect Happy Hour - which easily subs for a bargain dinner that will likely be one of the best meals you will have in Vegas.",

I personally like the Americanized sushi rolls that contain very little raw fish. I know that's not what real sushi is, but I'd rather not eat a moving octopus.  Anyways, they had some good stuff. We had the Crunchy Tuna roll and the Katana roll. The Crunch roll was amazing, it had spicy tuna inside. The Katana roll had raw tuna on the top that was like warm, not a fan of warm raw fish. But it looked nice.   The atmosphere was interesting. It was super dark inside like a fancy restaurant but the techno music was so loud that I couldn't  have a conversation at all. The staff was super nice and very helpful though.   Did I like it?; sort of. Would I come back?: No.",

I ended up ordering the hamachi with heirloom tomato and watermelon salad ($18). Delicious... came with some sort of pesto dressing and all ingredients worked well together. Then the A2 roll for $12, 6 pieces with albacore, onion, cucumber and jalapeno. Unfortunately, I couldn't taste the jalapeno, but it was a decent roll. Then finally the baked crab handroll for $9. I was expecting seaweed, but it came in some sort of soy wrapper instead and was more egg roll shaped. It was yummy though. Then $3 for hot tea on top of that. I can't say that I was full, but I was satisfied. Overall a good meal, just at a higher premium.",

Restaurants should NOT be comping you or sending you food because they can't deliver what you actually ordered in time. Plus, I don't want your shitty stir fry shrimp that tastes like it's from Panda Express because you're service is so slow. The lunch special sashimi with chicken and salad is a joke. The chicken was overcooked, and the salad was pathetic. I really wanted to be a bitch and send it back, but I always thought I'd just suck it up and never come back. I really worry that they think they food they're putting out is acceptable. The sashimi salad was alright, but the portion was ridiculously small. I tasted the rest of the sushi that the rest of the party had, and it was mediocre at best.   Come here if you're a \"gringo\" and don't care and just want some California rolls and a good view. Don't come here if you're expecting quality sushi and service for the price you're paying. Seriously disappointed!",

Not really an ideal place since there was someone sitting just outside smoking a cigar from the neighboring restaurant.   We ordered the following: Tuna Carpaccio Chicken Karaage Shima Roll Makoto Roll  Everything tasted good except not really worth the price. All four items above totaled $75 plus tip. You are paying a premium for atmosphere. Make sure to reserve and request a table with a view of the strip if you decide to try it out.",

The organic kale salad was very fresh and tasty.  I also had the filet foie and the lobster tempura which were exceptional.  My friends raved about the Chilean sea bass which one of them recommended since she goes to this restaurant often.  The chocolate dessert (so good I forgot the name) was delicious!!!  The service was attentive and knowledgeable.  And of course the view of the Strip from our table was unbeatable!",

I ended up going anyway, and we were seated right away. However, the waitress told us that the night before was insane and completely packed. She was really friendly :)  We ordered: 2 Eastern Mules (I think that's what it was called... deeelicious) Kobe Gyoza (yum!) Deep fried sea bass (om nom nom) filet mignon (i cannot attest to this plate but I can say that my spouse licked the plate clean)  Drinks were on point, gyoza yummy, and fish soooooooo good!!  Rolls sounded pretty yummy too.. I was happy with my choice to come here!",

I had an assortment of rolls and a friend joined us late but the restaurant accommodated without any problems.

Groups are rampant in Vegas so be prepared for them. Don't make them stand out front in ask way fashion while you quote 25min. Most people will leave.

Happy Hour is served in their lounge area with bar seating and a long 'communal' table. There are some may great hot & cold items, drinks and even deserts! Gosh we had so much food! Some of the items included: Miso Glazed Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Scallop sushi roll (it's got a lil kick!), Shrimp Tempura with Asparagus roll, Shishito peppers, Crispy Chicken and Vegetable tempura. Most of the HH cocktails drinks I think were $6 each and the hot green tea was served nice and hot! Carmelo was our server - did a great job and to show how committed they are to great experience - Johnny the GM and Guillermo - Asst. GM stopped by several times to check on how things were going. As other reviewers have noted - beautiful floor to ceiling glass window that overlooks the Strip - amazing views to go along with the amazing cuisine and service. I think this is one of the best deals for Happy Hour on the Strip with all of the great choices and the fact it's offered 7 days a week. Of course their regular lunch & dinner offerings are just as great! Next time you're at the Forum Shops or looking for a great experience - check it out! A MUST! ENJOY! ;-)",

Water was always full and the food and other things we requested came in a timely matter.They accidentally forgot the birthday girl's dish, but was able to provide her with a free dish to make up for it.   I got the Tako roll with the spicy octopus and salmon sashimi and both were delicious and tasted fresh. I also tried my friend's miso butter-fish dish wow! It was so soft and flavorful.  The birthday girl got a trio of pastry dessert and a candle to blow out to make her birthday extra special. A nice finishing touch to a great dining experience.  Atmosphere was pretty nice too - upscale ambiance. I would return when I go back to Vegas.",

    "text": "Oh dear god can someone get me another black truffle tempura handroll STAT. That's all you need to get from here. $10 or so and you'll have this beautifully crunchy and nutty mouthful of sushi. The black truffle is in the dipping sauce they serve the roll with so don't be an idiot and go dipping in your regular soy sauce! I would only come back to Sushi Roku to order this handroll.   Yes you do get a nice, undisturbed view of the strip (towards the Bellagio and Paris) but you'll definitely pay an arm and a leg for very small portions of sushi. Delicious, yes. Filling? Not so much.   The lobster roll we got has a special sauce drizzled all over the plate that tastes a lot like Todai's creamy sauce baked over their lobster halves and boy was it fingerlicking good. But it was $21+ for 5 (kind of small) pieces of sushi (see my picture if you don't believe me).   You are definitely paying for the view and atmosphere here. So go ahead, bring a date here if you want to splurge. But if you want a full stomach without breaking the bank, Sushi Roku ain't the place for you!  P.S. I'm all for ambiance and I understand that this is a sushi restaurant so the saying \"quality over quantity\" is taken very literally, but if a place is going to charge that much for their food, I expect service to be top notch as well and for me the service was just so-so. Hence, the 3 stars.",

The person I was with loved his food.  He had the seabass and a roll. I'd give this place a second shot but would stick with the more traditional stuff I know.  I also had their gun blossom cocktail.

Our favorite roll for the evening was the Jalapeno Tuna roll.  The server suggested the roll.  I was nervous about the Jalapeno so she had them make the roll without them.  It was such a mouthful of flavors.  The cilantro set the roll off and I never would have considered that combination but it totally worked.  As far as pricing I was not upset.  We ordered 4 drinks, 3 rolls and a side to share. When the bill came it was $130 before the tip.  Considering this was an on strip restaurant I didn't feel that was a bad price.   I'm sure you can find a cheaper place but the sushi won't be even close in comparison.",

The Katana roll was delish and we were very happy with our choice here.  After all that we decided to do one more roll...we shouldn't have.  The Crunchy Spicy Tuna disapointed.

Luckily, my husband spoke up and asked to sit near a window so we could enjoy the view. There were several vacant tables for two. Yes, we moved. We kept an eye on that original table; no one sat there while we were here. Hmmm...  I ordered the Katana ramen. I enjoyed it. The broth was smooth and milky. It had enough goodies inside although a little bit more pork would have made it better. To tell the truth I wanted ramen and this place was the closest. Another note, I'm a light eater, I think my husband could have eaten more ramen than what they served. I didn't finish mine, he finished the rest of my noodles.   I also had the Makoto roll; it was nice, but not something I'd order again.   I wanted to give this place three stars for wanting to sit us in the worst place especially because it wasn't busy. We were dressed casual, but nice. Others were dressed even more casual and had better seats. I want to be fair and not knock them down for first impressions.   The hostess sitting us was very friendly and so was the waitress. This restaurant is expensive just like every other Vegas restaurant on the strip establishment. I'd be willing to come back if I want ramen and I don't want to move my car and drive someplace.",

    "text": "I had THE BEST experience at Sushi Roku. When we went to the location, it was very easy to find and the restaurant was on the third floor of the Forum Shop at Ceasar's Place. The view outside the window was amazing. You can see the whole strip from the dining table if you get sitted by the widow. Perfect spot to go on a date.   The place seem to be constantly busy but not up to the point where we had to wait a long time to get seated. Our server name Maiko was the best server I ever had from all the different restaurant that I went to. We ordered Omakase with Sake pairing and she seem to be very knowledgeable on the food that she was serving as well as the sake that we had it paired with our sushi. Every time we finished our dish, she would come discreetly to clean our table and get it prepared for the next meal. When she was clearing the table of the empty plates, we were never interupted from our conversation and sometimes I didn't even realize that she took our plates. Our waters are always filled so we never had to ask for more water. Also our sake glasses are always filled as well so that's always a thumbs up~! (We order the bottle of sake and she would always be around to fill it our shot glasses whenever we took our shots) Also every time we get a dish, we always know what we are eating and how we should eat it. Chef that did our omakase came out himself to explain the dishes as well. We also got a chance to meet the Executive Manager of Sushi Roku and got to have conversation with him.   Finally the food, the sushi qualities are AMAZING~!! Every dish that came out was perfectly balanced and very pleasing to the eyes. We got all different kinds of dishes so our palate were never bored. There was a lot of times where I was getting full but I just had to keep eating because of the food look so appetizing and I just had to try more.   In the end, the overall experience was AMAZING and it is the go to place if you are craving sushi and happen to be on the Strip at Las Vegas. :D  **I will upload the pictures soon**",

The sushi was great - we really liked the tempura shrimp/jalapeno roll. The jalapenos were fresh so it gave the sushi a really nice crunch. No photo of the rolls, but they looked like pretty standard sushi rolls. :)   Location was super convenient and easy to get to most shows in that area.",

The food, the atmosphere, the server...a full package. We were not rushed, we ordered little items as we went. We all (4 of us) left full, happy and appreciated. Their drinks are really good too! They have something for almost everyone; sushi, cooked items, full meals, appetizers, etc. I think we must of ordered 1/2 the menu. The yellowtail diced chiles was incredible. The shishito Japanese peppers were something I wouldn't have normally ordered, but someone in our party did-they were delicious! The Hanabi-another dish I'd never had-that was SO good!! I could have just had a meal of that. But, glad I didn't everything was so good. Worth the walk!! We will definitely be back!",

Not only did you recommend decadent dishes, but you guided us in making all of the best decisions for both our pocket and our tummies. Everything we had from our drinks, to our appetizers, to our entrees, to our dessert was top notch quality!   This establishment takes pride in their food to another level. Yes, it is one of those places where you pay a little more for a little less in portion, but was it worth it? Every penny! The quality of fish here is outstanding! If you're a fish snob like me, you can understand that quality matters and paying bigger bucks is worth the expense.   It's all in the experience, and the view of the strip is pretty badass.   Thank you to Guillermo for accommodating our need to watch the hockey game and making our satisfaction your absolute priority. Way to get personal and make us feel right at home. ARIGATO",

Happy Hour- Sunday-Thursday: 4-7p Friday-Saturday: 4-6p  Nice ambiance, friendly staff, but I wish they were more attentive because everything came out quick except our mochi which came out 20 minutes after we asked for it (& all they had to do was get it from the freezer...), & the food was okay, very pricey but yet very simple.  Spicy Scallop Roll:  Good, simple. Crunchy Spicy Tuna Tempura:  Very lightly crunchy.  Okay. Salmon Nigiri:  Fresh. Katana Roll:  Good. Strawberry Mochi:  Very old!

The Oh-Toro was so fresh and delicate. And the yellow tail belly was phenomenal as well. The lamb chop special as well as the rib eye tobanyaki were beyond compare.   Our server Tommy, I have to say, one of the best servers I have ever encountered 2 years living here in Vegas. Iced Green Tea was never empty which is huge for me and my wife. Unlike some places , Sushi Roku doesn't treat you differently if you don't order alcohol. Tommy went above and beyond and his service as well as the quality of the food will have us coming here again and again.",

I love how the restaurant is on the 3rd floor and we were sat by the window so we saw the gorgeous view of the strip. Now .... let's get to the food!  We ordered pork belly fried rice, wagyu skewer, seared salmon sashimi, Salmon nigiri, baked crab handroll, and a roll.   The salmon nigiri was fresh and tasty. The baked crab handroll was simple but good! The pork belly fried rice had lots of flavor as well. The roll we had, had shrimp tempura, yellowtail, red tuna, and albacore I believe. All of these were satisfying dishes.  However - the most outstanding dish to my boyfriend and I were the wagyu skewer and seared salmon sashimi. The wagyu melted in our mouths and the seared salmon was absolute perfection especially with the avocado, ponzu sauce, and the veggies. They were so good we had to order them TWICE (along with another order of salmon nigiri)  Service was very attentive, I believe his name as Matthew. He was great. Always patient and kind.   So glad we came here. There were plenty of sushi restaurants to go to on the strip but the pictures sold me. Definitely will be back with my Sushi lovers whenever in town!",

After looking around for places on and off the strip, it seemed more convenient for ourselves as well as others to try this place because not everyone can get off the strip easily. We knew price was going to be higher than anywhere off the strip. We got a seat easily with a 5:30 reservation. We chose to sit at the sushi bar because it's a better experience. We started with the calamari which was super delicious. It was crispy but not over breaded. The spicy sauce it was just lightly coated in was good as well. We ordered four rolls: California, Senchi (or Senchu) katana and Titan. In that order they got better and better. The fish was fresh the presentation and was also great. Service was good and quick. All in all it seemed like all parties around us were enjoying their time.",

Food was as good as the sushi you would get from your local sushi joint but with an inflated price. But, it's the Las Vegas strip so it's completely understandable. We splurged and got the toro sushi (fatty tuna) and it did not disappoint.  The only thing is that the place is located at the end of the Cesar's palace shopping forum so be prepared for a 5-10 min walk to get there.  If your looking for a no hassle easy spot to enjoy good sushi and have a spectacular view while eating, then Sushi Roku is the place for you",

All delicious with unique garnishments. We also got the Kobe beef potstickers which were abolsolutly divine and filled with beef, not just a little beef and a lot of fillers. And lastly don't sleep on the cold ramen appetizer because that dish was my favorite of the whole weekend in Vegas and I will go back just to eat it. Service was fantastic too. Manager came around and checked on us.",

He began ordering some things that didn't sound familiar from the menu.....turned out he was a regular that had his own routine and they seemed happy to accommodate him.  We followed suit and ordered two pieces of gold truffle yellowtail.....simply put the best piece of sushi I have ever had....I fully expected each piece to run $30 for how elaborate it was but they ended up being $25 for the pair.  Still a pricey single piece of sushi but absolutely worth it.  Service was what you would expect sitting at a sushi bar....the sushi chef's were open to conversation and very polite.    Price point is on par for being in the Forum Shops at Caesars.",

Unfortunately, we missed that happy hour by a slight margin, so we were forced to pay the full price.   Located on the 3rd floor of the 'Forum shops' by Caesars. Just take those winding escalators all the way up. Take in the wow-mazement and gaudiness of it all.   The quality was very good... no complaints there.  The plating was typical. Nothing fancy or over the top. Drinks--Were delicious. Go for one of the cocktails. Not only are they tasty, but make a great palate cleanser. Downside: Not very strong.   Pricing here is on the higher end if you don't make it during happy hour. That was really only my disappointment.   Service was good. Not pretentious, or stuffy.   I think sushi Roku can come off as more frou-frou than it really is. We saw many of people hanging casual in here, despite the high ambiance feeling they try to portray. Then again, that's honestly the entire mall that encompasses this place. So come decked to the nines, or in your tennis shoes.   Definitely a decent spot for Sushi while in Vegas.",

    "text": "WARNING!!! DO NOT ORDER THE CHEF'S OMAKASE MENU!   My husband, cousin, and myself were staying at Caesar's Palace this past weekend and we were craving sushi. Since Sushi Roku was located inside the hotel, we decided that it would be convenient to go there.   We decided to splurge a little and try the Chef's Omakase Menu ($90 per person). We were super excited. They even offered a complimentary glass of champagne which was so delicious.    The meal started off strong. We were served a piece of halibut sashimi w/ shiso leaf & yuzu gelee, a piece of king crab w/ caviar, and a piece of seared toro with a piece of truffle on it. All three of us were in ahhhh. This alone deserves two stars. We immediately thought that if the first course was an indication of what was to come....we definitely were in for a treat.  Unfortunately...it was all down hill after wards. Our second course was a seared albacore salad. It was good, but nothing special. The third course was 4 pieces of red snapper sashimi (this was one of our least favorite dishes). The 4th course was a miso glazed halibut (so common). Then came the sushi course. I was expecting this  to be the best course, but it ended up being the worst. We were served Spicy Tuna Rolls topped with pieces of sashimi (kind of like a rainbow roll), and three pieces of sushi (toro, mackerel, and yellowtail). All of this was followed by a chocolate lava cake for the dessert.   Our bill came out to $377 and it was a major disappointment. I've eaten at other Sushi Roku locations and they were good, but this meal just pissed me off. When someone orders an Omakase Menu....it pretty much represents what the restaurant has to offer. If I knew I was going to get Spicy Tuna Roll for $90, I would never had opted to splurge.   Note: The rating that I give Sushi Roku is 2.5 stars. The half star is simply for the complimentary champagne that comes with the omakase menu.",

Prices are in line with the other Sushi Roku's, which means pricey.  I live in one of the cities with the best sushi, so in terms of quality, Sushi Roku is a not the best or freshest I've had, but it's damn good considering it's in the middle of the Vegas desert!

    "text": "For a place that I have expected to be trendy with amazing food, this place falls flat.    The cocktails were mediocre, and food was mediocre.  The only thing that was sort of OK was the atmosphere.    We were first there for drinks, but later decided to have dinner.  The bartender that day didn't seem too happy and had a straight face the whole time.  He didn't try to make any kind of conversation and just made drinks and took our order.  Ok, I don't mind it too much because as long as he made great drinks and didn't mess up our orders I didn't mind.  The drinks as I said, were mediocre.    We had a couple rolls and it was still mediocre, which was very disappointing.  I had hanabi with spicy tuna which I thought the flavors just didn't mesh well at all.  The tuna itself was amazing, but with the fried cube of sushi rice dipped in sweet soy sauce... it just doesn't fit.  The seaweed salad was a little bit on the salty side, and that it was nothing more special than the ones I can get from a Japanese market.   I also had Shima roll, which was shrimp wrapped with spicy tuna, avocado, and cilantro.  It was not bad, but not good either. Just bland I guess.  Not impressed.   Overall I thought with the price I paid I could have better sushi elsewhere.  If I wanted mediocre sushi I didn't have to come all the way to Vegas.",

My biggest complaint was that I ordered a roll with jalapeno since I adore fresh jalapenos, and it tasted like celery. It had no flavor or spice, which didn't warrant the incredibly high price tag on this \"special\" roll. All it added was crunch. If I'm dropping over $20 on a roll, I think it should be perfect.   In a lot of ways this place is five stars, but at the end of the day, it still comes down to the food, and very good doesn't qualify as amazing.",

Her friends were giving us some dirty looks b/c we were staring/I think they could hear us asking each other if that was Bette Midler.   Aside from that, our sushi was delicious! My friend and I shared the sake sampler and man that did the job. We were both pretty happy feeling and our sushi was so fresh, and so yummy! They service here was excellent, they really know how to provide upscale, quality customer service.  Our waiter was very friendly and got our food delivered fast.  One of the managers also came by to check on us and see how we were doing.  He was also taking care of Bette Midler's table, and after they left he was very friendly and polite in confirming that that was really her.

As one of them escorted us to the table, she nonchalantly asked how I was doing but it wasn't very sincere. She seated us right in front where we can see ... the outside to the mall. I caught a quick glimpse of the darker area of the restaurant that supposedly have a great view of the strip lit up.  Needless to say, at least our server was nice. I told him we had a show to catch (Peep Show) and the order came out very quickly. We ordered:  - Foie Gras wrapped in Yellow tail sashimi (foie gras was over powering and salty) - Toro (don't remember what it even tastes like, not impressed) - Japanese Yellow Tail Sashimi with Diced Chiles (too salty) - Chilean Seabass w/Yuzu butter (this was a flavorful dish. The bass was very well cooked) - Kobe Beef Skewers w/ Black Pepper Sauce (flavorful and tender; thumbs up) - Spicy Tuna and Rainbow Roll (rolls were pretty good size and tasted fresh)  Total for 2 people: $216 including 1 mojito and 1 cocktail  Would I go back? Only if I get a chance to have a nice view of the strip at night but besides that, not really.",

This has lead us to many a sushi house. Avoiding the white rice ridden rolls, it has driven us away from the AYCE and towards the more expensive end of the spectrum, and of course the costlier (really a word?) strip. Being that we used to do a high price steakhouse about once a month and gone rolling out feeling nearly comatose from gorging ourselves, we have accepted this. Having said all that.... My other half and I have deemed that thus far Sushi Roku has the top slot for us.  Food was amazing, waitstaff was; attentive, patient and above all VERY knowledgeable about their menu. Other places in town act as though they are doing you a favor waiting on you... The staff here explained how things were prepared, what types of oils were used, sauces, etc. We could adjust to fit our healthier lifestyle, but honestly once we were clear on what we wanted the waitstaff took care of everything!  We did the Chef's tasting menu and what others are talking about on here I have no idea. This is not a Costco (bulk buying) type of sushi place. If that is what you are looking for this is not the place for you. Take time, ask questions.  Sake flight was also fun. Loved that they served it with the information card. The hardest part of these things is remembering what you are drinking after they leave and trying to remember. It was served with an info card that aligned with the glasses so you could read about them while you drank, and the waitress paired each with a specific course.  Sorry Tao, Social House, Little Buda, Nobu we have a new home.  View also is amazing!! Gorgeous atmosphere. Hats off to the entire staff you should be very proud of your operation.",

It was fusion while still retaining basic essence of good, clean Japanese flavors.The only complaint was the over peppering of the tuna steak. A very pleasant dining experience if one ever needs a break from buffet overload.",

    "text": "Sushi Roku was my favorite meal in Vegas on a long weekend trip. All the food we had was delicious - the sashimi was fresh, the rolls were innovative and the hot food was cooked and seasoned perfectly. My favorites were the yellowtail sashimi, kobe meatballs, and the rolls we ordered from the specials menu (unfortunately I can't remember what they were). While everything was great and high-quality, I would suggest ordering more of their unique dishes as those were the stand-outs. The baked cod has the standard miso coat popular at similar restaurants and the whole sea bass is reminiscent of what you can find in Chinese restaurants.  Service was excellent - our servers gave us great recommendations and were very helpful in helping us understand portions and accommodating special requests. We were celebrating a bachelorette, and they sent over complimentary desserts with a sparkler! Overall, our experience was memorable and I highly recommend  Sushi Roku for special occasions or just a nice dinner out.",

We had gone for happy hour (Sunday4-7). It was so frakkin good. I think I literally might have tried every single appetizer on the menu and some even twice haha They had asparagus and crispy rice and popcorn rock shrimp! Everyone in the restaurant was also very nice and attentive to our needs. I swear I would only drink out of my water cup maybe once or twice, and they were already refilling my water haha  The waitress we had was named Ellen. Very cute and bubbly girl. She was very patient and kind in explaining all of the items for happy hour and in suggesting what she really likes. It was our friend's birthday, so she even had a little birthday dessert prepared - even though it was only happy hour! So cute and nice.  I would definitely come back here again.",

The scallops were cooked to perfection. Me, not being a big fan of foie gras, even loved the combination. I ordered the hot soba, which was pretty good! Their rolls are a good serving size, so I would suggest ordering rolls or an entree and splitting the scallops. Did I mention that they're amazing???  SERVICE: Our waitress was super nice. When the restaurant was a little less busy (we were seated at 5:30PM), the manager even came over and asked us how everything was. Superb service! We had mentioned that it was our friend's birthday that day, so they came out at the end with molten chocolate cake and THE MOST AWESOME SPARKLER EVER. Seriously, such good service.  Why the three stars? Everything was pretty expensive, and there is much more for your money on the strip. If it were anywhere else, this place would definitely get a four!",

We try a new one each time we are in town (eventually we will be able to name our favorite... maybe). This trip we tried Sushi Roku in the Forum Shops. We are sushi lovers, but for some reason other dishes called out to us more at this restaurant.  We decided to try a few of the premium (read high quality ingredients and therefore expensive) appetizers.  We started with Kobe beef tataki - a method involving a brief sear, slicing thinly, and marinating in vinegar or, in this case, garlic and ponzu. This was one of my husband's favorite dishes from the whole trip - he was very tempted to order a second round. Next we had a salmon carpaccio with truffle soy vinaigrette which was very tasty. Lastly we had panko crusted salmon with wasabi and tonkatsu sauces. This was one of my favorite dishes of the whole trip. The salmon was warm and flaky and moist on the inside with a crispy crust of panko on the outside. The wasabi cream and the tangy, savory tonkatsu sauce (typically served with breaded, fried pork) worked perfectly together. I could eat this every day and I would be very happy. We both love unfiltered sake, and Roku had a very good one that we had not seen anywhere else before.  2 out of three dishes being overall trip favorites gives this place 5 stars!",

Service- The hostess was extremely nice and asked us for our preference in seating. We chose a table, rather than the sushi bar. After being seated, we were greeted by our server. He was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. I asked him for his recommendation in sake and food, both of which he answered with great detail. Throughout the meal, he was extremely attentive. He checked on us multiple times, and never let our drinks become empty.  Food- The food was phenomenal. Based on the server's recommendation, we ordered the Chilean Sea Bass as an appetizer. It was absolutely amazing. The flavors were delicious and the sea bass literally melted in our mouths. We also ordered the chicken fried rice which was exceptional. As far as sushi, we ordered the California roll and baked lobster roll. Both were phenomenal. Overall, everything was extremely delicious.  Atmosphere- The restaurant is dimly lit and cozy. There is a great view of the strip if you are seated inside of the restaurant, rather then on the forum side. It does get a little loud, and some of the tables are rather close. However, that didn't bother us. A lot of the tables around us were having a great time.   Overall, I would definitely dine at Sushi Roku again. Everything was exceptional. It definitely has great reviews for a reason!",

Initially my group of 16 was going to eat at Texas de Brazil, but after a couple days of buffets and steaks the guys in my group couldn't handle it anymore. We made last minute reservations at Sushi Roku for a party of 16 on a saturday.  I arrived a bit later but when I did some of the guys were getting hooked up big time at the bar with shots and drinks which was real cool. We were seated after taking some shots and just started ordering an assortment of sushi rolls and king crab fried rice. The king crab fried rice was simple yet so pleasing. It really hit the spot and filled us up quickly. Sushi rolls were all pretty decent. Of course we all partaked in sake bombs.   The service was off the charts. The waitresses were so accommodating and polite. Upon getting our check they said we could take $400 dollars off. This was absolutely mind blowing. Apparently one of the guys of our party was chopping it up with the General manager unknowingly and complimented the dude on his $1600 dollar armani suit. BAM instant savings son. We all suspect he performed sexual favors to get us the discount. You do what you got to do when you are a team player I guess. I kid I kid.  Anyway the meal was decent, the service was ridiculously good, the restaurant decor was swanky and chill, and the bill for us, vegas standard wise, was an all time winner.  General Manager Johnny. Compliment the guy on his suit *cough*. The dude is an all time legendary great.",

Sushi is solid, but nothing your usual local Sushi bar won't offer for 12-15 a roll. Service is somewhat irritating- kept coming back too often and wouldn't let me have a decent conversation.  Start with an edamame; try the Filet Mignon Asparagus.",

The service was impeccable and the meal was outstanding.  I cant get over the shiseido peppers.  I dont think I'll ever get tired of this dish!  Here's the one thing that throws me off -- this place is a million times better than nobu.  Why does nobu have its own... tower at Cesar's palace?  I dont get it!

    "text": "The Sushi Roku empire was built out in Los Angeles, but the trendy vibe was transported across state lines to be featured in their Las Vegas location.  The third floor digs inside the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace provide expansive views of the Strip.  Being only a few flights above ground, you are able to enjoy the towering lights of the hotels, as well as the entertaining antics happening on the busy street.  The dim lighting and Asian-inspired decor make Sushi Roku a seductive spot.  However, the high ceilings and open dining room can get quite loud when full of larger parties.  (Our meal was continuously disrupted by a rowdy birthday celebration.)  Since we were grabbing a late dinner, we decided to opt for some light courses.  I ordered the Mixed Sashimi Salad, which was a mound of fresh field greens topped with radish slices and served over thinly cut raw fish.  The platter included tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and more.  A snappy ginger vinaigrette was drizzled over the dish, providing a gentle spicing.  Each piece of fish was light, fresh, and tender.  I also sampled their Eel Avocado Roll, which contained eel slices so warm that the maki easily fell apart, one of my pet peeves.  My friend ordered the special Katana Roll.  The massive portion contained about 10-12 slices of a mixed spicy tuna and shrimp tempura maki, topped with tuna and yellowtail slices.  It was a fantastic concoction that she reminisced about for days.  Many hip Japanese spots that provide fun atmospheres and innovative cooking styles, such as Nobu, often do not provide the same food quality as more traditional spots.  However, Sushi Roku scores 4 stars on all of points - style, creativity, and taste.",

My girlfriend and I were in a hurry so we stopped by here without a reservation on a Saturday night. Three (!) hostesses (no idea why they needed that many since none of them were doing anything) at the stand rudely told us all we could sit at would be the sushi bar even though we saw many open tables. I did not complain and happily accepted that. Big mistake.  We were jammed into two spots at the tight sushi bar and given a drink list. After waiting about 10 minutes for someone to take our drink bar, the sushi chef impatiently asked if we were ready. Um, no menus yet. He yelled at a server who came by and apologized and gave us menus and took our drink orders. Ok, honest mistake we thought...  Drinks came back and we ordered edamame and our sushi. Edamame never came and we couldn't get our server back until after we ate our rolls, which did come out quick.   I complimented our sushi chef on the rainbow roll and he barely grunted back at me. Meanwhile, the chef to our left was having a very long conversation with the couple next to us. Maybe we got a grumpy chef? Either way, the rolls were good but I felt as if I had done something to piss off the staff which I felt to be pretty impossible since we had barely even got anyone to talk to us and I had been nothing but polite and complimentary.  When asked about the edamame, server just smacked his head and said sorry. He was nice enough but apparently overworked or not prepared to handle weekend volume. Either way, pretty poor from what I expected to be some of the best sushi on the strip.  Bill came to $70 for 3 rolls, salmon sashimi and a soft drink or two. Couldn't wait to get out of here. Food was good but I'd rather have my money back. This is the worst side of Vegas: overpriced, rude service, and no one pushing the staff to do better.",

Paul sits me down at the sushi bar and the chef just stares at me. I was so hungry I didn't even think to ask for the OMAKASE ! What an idiot! The Omakase is $90 per person, but they serve so much that I saw people fall of the chair from being full. I don't even remember what I ordered, but I lost my balance after the first bite. Then I turned around to face the windows and THE VIEW!!! THE VIEW of my beloved las VEgas Blvd from the 3rd floor of Cesar's Palace with an orgasmic sushi in my mouth made my night.  Cesar's Palace curves at this point on the Blvd. and you end being sort of in the middle of it with bay view windows.

Prices weren't too bad...  I usually check the prices of the spicy tuna roll (since every sushi place has them) for comparison.  The Spicy Tuna Rolls at Sushi Roku were $11.  Again, expensive, but not over the top.  And for delicious sushi, I'll take it any day!  Make sure you go here - much better than Yellowtail Sushi in the Bellagio, and less expensive too!",

The sashimi was fresh and tasty, including the uni, so you know it was amazing. The restaurant was beautiful with a great view of the Strip. The managers were very gracious and knowing we had a show to catch, ordered us the chocolate cake for dessert. Plus the sake list was great and we were able to enjoy an excellent Daiginjo-shu. I can't wait to return.",

We ate here for a birthday dinner before a show but were unfortunately rushed to get to the show on time. The interior design is very zen and chic. We had a table with a view of the strip from Caesar's forum shops which was top notch. Our waitress Shaina was awesome, enthusiastic and helped us with back road directions to get to our show on time! I was under the weather so only had the soup and veggie tempura but as previously mentioned, this soup rocked. I didn't sample the sushi choices at the table but only heard good things. Our food was bit delayed coming out considering it was sushi, but upon investigation, Shaina found out the chefs were making the miso from scratch! The country miso had filet mignon to make the broth a bit heartier, hence the extra time apparently. Well worth the wait and they comped us a salmon carpaccio starter. Drinks were also tasty! I'd love to go back!",

If you like attentive service, that would be the perfect time to go.  There were exactly 4 other customers in the restaurant...despite the few customers, there was a hostess, a waiter, a water guy, an appetizer/plate clearing guy, 2 sushi chefs, and a manager.  No wonder a vegetarian roll is $14!  Great view of the strip from the booths, and the decor was modern, comfortable and elegant  (think low backed leather couches and natural materials).  My sweetie and I had the Chef's sushi combo, a Harvest roll (skip it), and the spicy tuna roll.  All of the fish was like butter (yellowtail, salmon, tuna, shrimp).  Really fresh, better than some I've had here at home on the the west coast.  I had a cocktail called the Tokyo Cooler--a very delicious, refreshing, dangerous cocktail.  I could have gotten prom-night drunk on those, no prob.  Rolls were $13-26  (approx 4 pieces)each, sashimi $13-24 for 4 pieces.  Handrolls $6.  All in all we spent $55 on lunch.  We were satiated--not overly so--I wanted to save room for gelatto.",

We ordered the seaweed salad, a tofu dish, spicy peppers, tempura, two vegetarian harvest sushi rolls, two sweet potato rolls, and two cucumber, avocado, and jalapeno rolls. Every single dish was fresh, tasty and filling. The portion sizes were decent enough to share. The service was excellent.

This is the second time that I have at there, but I will focus my review on this past visit.  We had a sample menu with a variety of different appetizers and entrees, so we really ate much of the menu.  For sushi on the Las Vegas strip, this place would get four stars from me.  I normally hate spicy tuna rolls, but I absolutely loved this one!  The rest of the food was just as impressive.   Now the bad.  First, the service was only ok.   There wasn't anything that stood out as really horrible, but for the price of the restaurant I would have expected more, especially in Las Vegas.  Also, I am really into my wine, and this place gets an \"F\" for  their wine list.  There was nothing that really was appealing, and the cab I ended up trying was so bad that I changed to Sapporo.    Overall, nice place to have some sushi while you are in the Caesars area.  Maybe you would have a little better experience than I did with the service only focusing on 2-4 people instead of 20-25.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I are from Vancouver and knew we would be eating a heap of fast food on our trip to Vegas, so scoped out the top Japanese restaurants in Vegas ahead of time. Sushi Roku was one of the top on the list, and as we passed by it during the day at Caesar's Palace, the decor looked lovely, as did the menu.  I was really impressed with the ambiance of the place - it looked like it could fit 150 people easily and the furniture and light fixtures were grandiose. It was quiet on a Monday night, but allowed us to take in the spectacular night view of the strip. We started off with some edamame, Ingen Itame (Sauteed Chinese green beans with garlic sauce, $8), and Miso Eggplant Dengaku ($10) which were already really good. The eggplant was sweet tasting and crispy on the outside (Leo pointed out that it's because they removed most of the skin) but soft on the inside. Leo also ordered some Kobe Gyoza ($12) on special, which he was barely able to touch because of the entrees we ordered.  Since this place is named for its sushi, I tried out the Eel Avocado roll ($9) and Garden vegetable roll ($12). The eel roll was pretty standard, nothing better than what I think I could get in Vancouver, but no complaints. The thing about the veggie roll was that it had a pretty strong japanese herb called Mizuna which is in between mint and cilantro. Not what my tastebuds normally like.  Leo's choices were the special Baked lobster roll with creamy miso ($21) and the special Spicy crunchy shrimp roll ($18) which had tempura batter-like crumbs sprinkled over it. That was my favourite roll and definitely something I hadn't ever tried before. Leo wasn't impressed by the lobster, I think just because it was the most expensive and didn't really live up to the gourmet taste he was expecting. Most dishes involving lobster in the USA are pretty costly.  In the end we had to take home most of the pieces and had no room for dessert. The service at Sushi Roku was excellent - we aren't used to having one staff take orders and check-in and another serving food and drinks, so that was a bonus for us. The server even folded Leo's napkin when he went out to the restroom.  The only thing that lacks the extra star for this review was the dark corner table we had that made it almost impossible to read the menu in candlelight, and the just-above average rolls that were priced more than we'd usually pay at a restaurant in Vancouver.  All in all, not a bad place to try if you're craving some sushi, have some money to spend, and want a romantic place to dine at with a great view of the strip.",

We sat at the large couch-like tables and seating area, which are the best seats in the house.    We ordered the spicy tuna on cripsy rice, which was very good.  The jalepenos were diced and mixed into the tuna which was much better than most places that just place a sliver of the jalepeno on the rice.  Very tasty.  We also ordered the peppered kobi beef skewers which were tender and flavorful. Perfectly grilled.    We also ordered the baked crab handroll...which were the best we've ever eaten and we've had the ones at Katsuya and Koi. These by far were the best as the crab was flavorful and was stuffed in there...unlike Katsuya where they have the tendency to skimp on the ingredients.  The best part of the night was the chilean sea bass with miso glaze. That fish was cooked to perfection, it was light, flaky and ever so sweet.  This place rocks!",

We received a bill without the tip for $97.40. What a rip off to say the least. I wasn't expecting it. I guess this restaurant is only for turists who probably never ate sushi or will never go back.

Honestly, I could live off the spicy tuna here. It's perfectly spicy, perfectly textured, and perfectly great. Try the spicy scallop hand roll and yellowtail sushi too; all their fish is extremely high quality, and it obviously reflects the steep prices.  We ordered a bottle of Saki (can't remember the name, probably because I couldn't  pronounce it at the time), and it went down extremely smooth and had a great, light flavor.. Our waitress would run over everytime she saw our shot glasses empty and pour us another round; ROYAL TREATMENT.",

Probably the best place I ate at all weekend. lets see what we ate: -Crunchy Spicy Tuna: had avocado, spicy tuna, spicy mayo sauce and a crunchy topping it was AMAZING! i loved it -Baked Lobster Roll: baked lobster, rice paper roll, asparagus, miso sauce.  it was all wrapped up and then baked and the miso sauce is nice and toasted and warm it was soo delicious -spicy scallop roll: i had the cut roll not the hand roll. honestly it was just okkay. nothing super spectacular -shrimp fried rice: pretty yummy just your basic fried rice we all shared it and it was good -miso soup: perfect not too salty but just right I mean lets be honestly everything in Vegas is expensive so I don't think the prices were outraged compared to everywhere else. I think for the price it is way better then anywhere else that we went.  If u are a sushi lover like I am then i think you will enjoy this place and bonus ITS AIR CONDITIONED inside the mall so its nice!",

I am sure there are other places to go for sushi in Vegas but the location (in Caesar's Forum Shops and there is valet, right off of Las Vegas Blvd., so no mixing with all the other LVB traffic, cabs and hoypoloy!) Our latest visit was much of the same, great service, sushi and quality. They had a private event that took up most of the dining room, but opened up more seating and were able to seat our party of 4, maybe 15 minutes later but it was prime time dinner hour 7:30 pm and there is a Peter Lik gallery across the way so the wait was nominal.   We ordered our staple crab miso, rolls and sushi. The wait staff was attentive and quick to fill waters, change plates and check on us.   We had a great meal!",

Obviously the top criterion for any sushi place is the quality of the fish. It tasted fresh--and I mean out of the ocean fresh! I still am having a hard time trying to get my head wrapped around the fact that Las Vegas is nowhere near an ocean and yet it was the freshest sushi I ever had.  With that out of the way, the service was impeccable. More than one person had their eye on me to see if I wanted anything else. What I was impressed by was that they balanced the way to be immediately responsive without being too imposing. All I had to do was make eye contact with one of the restaurant staff anywhere and they seemed to master communication by gesture among the staff so the right person could address whatever it is i was looking for.  Finally, what is a sushi place without a master sushi chef? This guy was good. I even asked if they had things that were not on the menu and he still produced them in less than three minutes.  Granted I did drop 80 dollars by myself here, but with this kind of service and this kind of food, I find it is worth the money.  If you are in Vegas, and you really like sushi, there is no excuse not to go here.",

When we got there we were seated at a very nice table, and we were able to order the Sea Bass, with a Crab Dynamite sushi roll as an appetizer. Service was excellent, the food arrived much quicker than I would have expected, and it was delicious!  After they cleared our plates, the chef (I think) and waitress brought a very nice desert to our table with \"Happy Anniversary\" scripted in chocolate around the edge of the plate, and a little firework that shot sparks up for about 30 seconds, while the waitress took a picture for us. The manager also came by during the meal to make sure everything was as it should be.  We couldn't have been more pleased.",

I could go on and on about each dish. As an afterthought, the decor is beautiful and the service is great too. =P  The only thing i didn't like was the hostess.

I guess anywhere you can get a reservation for 12 on 2 hours notice for friday is unlikely to be the hottest place in town.  Not only am I not a huge sushi fan (I know, kind of a dumb comment for a review of a sushi restaurant), but its in Caesar's Palace.  We were staying over at Wynn, so we had to get across town and make our way past all the people with oxygen tanks hanging out at Caesar's (yes, I think clientele at Caesar's tends to be old and stuffy).  Place had no ambience, but that could be attributable to the crowd (NCAA tourney weekend, so lots of sausagefest tables).  However, food was AWESOME (bold statement for a guy impartial to Sushi). We had 4-5 kinds of tuna, and all were fantastic.  I ordered the filet mignon as well, which was almost steak house quality (yes, i shared it).  And by doing big beers and sake rather than wine, tab only came to $100 per person, which is half what I would expect to pay for dinner in Vegas.",

Yes, it's pricey for the dinner entrees.  American Kobe and Japanese Kobe steak not the same - Kobe beef much better!  The sushi / sashimi prices are on par on what you would find in Japan - so the sushi prices weren't pricey in my opinion just the end bill.    We liked the cool, retro interior albeit somewhat dark but it had a good view of the strip.  We had good service both times eating here.

We all had seen the Sushi Roku sign from the strip so decided to give it a try.  The sushi was off only mediocre quality, at best. For that quality, it was extremely overpriced. Each of us only had one cut roll (I also had one hand roll) and the bill came to $120 for four people.  I can't tell you where else to grab sushi in the Forum Shops, but there are plenty of more cost-effective options in there. I'd suggest Spagos (near the entrance to the casino on the second level).",

    "text": "Wow....where do I start. We headed to Las Vegas to celebrate my 40th birthday and because I love sushi I wanted to experience it Las Vegas style. I went onto Yelp to see what people had to say and discovered Sushi Roku. I literally read through each and every review to see what the hype was all about. Everyone kept talking about how great the wait staff was and how if its your birthday you get even \"better\" treatment.  We showed up for our dinner reservations (and the host staff and wait staff was aware at this time that it was my birthday) and the two hostesses were so cold to my party. We then were seated at a window seat which was great I have to admit, the views were wonderful.  The \"waitress\" finally after about 8 minutes decided to grace us with her presence and didn't introduce herself to us and blankly took our drink order. My first thought was \"wow she is so not personable\". It proceeded to go down from there. The food arrived so that one person was eating like 10 minutes before any of the other food arrived for the table. She never gave us the time of day but was working the other tables. Finally one of my friends asked her if she was aware it was my birthday and with a cold glare she said \"yes\". At that point I was ticked, you would think as a wait person (which I have done for years in my past professions) that you would try a little harder for the tip you EXPECT to receive from a group.  Needless to say I approached the manager on the way out and told him that I felt very disappointed in my experience there and obviously they should look at their staff members. I would never go back there based on my experience. If you do try it good luck hopefully you get someone nice but dont expect anything special even on your birthday.",

    "text": "First, I'll start out by saying I'm a big sushi fan and have made it that I have to try a new sushi spot each trip.  This time around my friend and I picked Sushi Roku for lunch on Christmas day.  Sushi Roku is located in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace third level right next to BOA Steakhouse.  We had reservations and once we got there was seated right away and the place is beautiful.  The decor was very nice which gave this place a great atmosphere.  The view was looking right down the strip which was very nice.  They get an A+ for the design and setup for this place.  The staff there was very friendly and helpful.  By no means the best service I've had but water and drinks were always filled.  Answered any questions we had when we asked.  First thing to know we had the Yellowtail at Social house at TI and have been looking for anything anywhere as good as there.  Nothing has lived up to it yet.  We started off with the Mixed Seafood & Vegetable Tempura and it was pretty good.  I've never had Tempura before so I can't compare to anything else.   Got the Yellowtail and I was very disappointed it just lacked much flavor and was not impressed.  I also ordered the Spicy tuna cut and this was some of the best Spicy tuna I've had.  Little Buddha was the best before I went to Sushi Roku.  The Spicy tuna was so fresh and just melted in your mouth.  Overall I would go back if I run out of sushi spots but still have Koi, Yellowtail, and Wazuzu to try in the near future.  The prices at Sushi Roku are on the high side and in my opinion not worth it per say.  For just the 2 pieces of Yellowtail and Spicy tuna it was 18.32 plus another 13.00 to split the tempura with my friend.  Overall a good spot to go but not the best sushi in Vegas.",

Been coming here ever since the grand opening and even though it's in an obscure area of the Forum Shops at Caesar's, it's definitley worth the trek.  Always have consistently good food here with great decor (and if you sit at the right spot on a nice summer night, they open the sliding windows open so you can \"feel\" the strip view).  Have come with small groups as well as large and this place never fails me.  Some recommended dishes:  Seared yellowtail with diced chile (extra chile for me please!!), popcorn rock shrimp, chilean seabass, chicken nuggets with that cilantro-like dipping sauce, and pretty much any of their sushi.  I've been to all the Roku's (except the newly opened one at the W in AZ) and this one is as good if not better than any of the other ones.  It's always bigger, badder, and better in Vegas.",

We ordered Nigiri (Sake, Tuna, Hamachi, and Trout). The trout was the recommendation of the server and GOOD GOD, best nigiri I've ever had. Imagine Salmon, which is so fresh and buttery and smooth, but MORE buttery and smooth. It was like what salmon WANTS to be.  We also tried a few rolls which were incredible, but the nigiri is really where they shined.  I can't wait to come back next time in LV! ENJOY!",

On my last visit here (mid-Jan 2012, on a Saturday), I went for a late lunch (around 2-3pm), got the Shima Roll with a side of Edamame. Ate these with a Grey Goose with a splash of Sprite. Very yummy, wish I had gotten another roll because it was very tasty.  Server was so nice, very warm & friendly. Hostess was also super nice.  Sort of funny story: I was seated on the end of 1 row of tables, on the booth part of the table. 2 guys were on the opposite end of my row.

Not sure how many ounces it ended up being but for not being the Japanese version, it was a very tender New York cut. Full of flavor, well seasoned, and a healthy side of varied mushrooms and green beans. You'll have to get your carbs from their various specialty sushi rolls or nigiri options.  Basic dessert menu, actually decided to skip it since it didn't stand out and the pricey entree already made the dinner worthwhile.  Great ambiance and if you have the option, opt for the lounge seating instead of the normal tables.  5 stars for the awesomely flavored food and comfortable interior. Of course I could nit pick about the lackluster dessert options or opine about the lack of real Japanese Kobe beef, but the sushi, entree, and appetizer menu is varied enough to include something for everyone.",

    "text": "Quite disappointed with this place on NYE. The portions were soooo tiny, MY GOSH for $145, I'd expected more. The girl on the phone said 7 course, when we got there it's only 6 course. Not only that but seriously, everything is tiny! I been to Japan and even their portions were bigger.   The sushi did not seem fresh at all. The color was quite dull. The tofu lobster thing was alright, and the dessert-- I definitely had better.  The worst part was the fact they kept forgetting about our order and wanted to rush us to finish. The couple next to us was even asked by the Manager to leave and move to the bar if they wanted to stay.   I didn't even get my champagne toast because it took them so long, so I left. The view and the seating was disappointing, despite the fact I have already requested a good window seating.  The cocktail was good, ginger lychee mojito, but gah...I'm quite disappointed and would not come back. Maybe if I was coming back for the Anago since it's the only place I've seen so far that serves it. I should of ordered off the regular menu, but the girl mentioned the pre fixe was better..yea..right..",

    "text": "I've been a big fan of the Sushi Roku in Pasadena for years! The Vegas one is a step down from the one in Pasadena, but it's still enjoyable if you're looking for reasonably priced sushi in Vegas. It's located inside a mall, so the location leaves something to be desired, but whatever. We got an assortment of rolls and sashimi as well as some alcoholic beverages. The waitress forgot our sake so she ended up giving us an extra one for free! Really nice of her!  SERVICE: Minus forgetting our sake, the service was really good. FOOD: the rolls were really good but the some of the sashimi were cut unevenly.  I've been to other sushi bars in Vegas, however, and they were all twice as expensive as this place, so I thought it was worth it. Also, they have allot of non sushi items on their menu too, so if you're going with sushi lovers and you hate it, there's plenty for you!",

The salmon carpaccio had wonderful olive oil, mint, and light seasoning that I loveeeeeeee.  $7 for a 12oz Sapporo?  Well, this is Vegas.

    "text": "I normally would give this type of restaurant 4 stars, but because of the fact that it's in Vegas and it was a Valentine's dinner, I will go all out and give it 5 stars!   I had Sushi Roku as one of my bookmarks, and as I was sitting around waiting for my boyfriend, I realized that we didn't have reservations anywhere on Valentine's night. We had a show that night at the Caesars hotel, so I figured this would be perfect! I called and they took us in no problem. She did ask for my credit card to hold my reservation, but the machine was broken at the time. I wonder if they charge you if you don't show up..?  Anyway, it took us awhile to find this restaurant and I am pretty sure we went around and found every place you can eat at before we got to Sushi Roku. So for any future diners, the best thing to do just go through the Forum shops since it's located there, rather than the actual hotel. The atmosphere and decor is absolutely beautiful, from the lighting fixtures to the bathroom doors. We were sat at a table that had the view of the entire strip on one side and the other side looked out to Harrah's.. sooo cool! This is worth a visit just for the view alone!  The service was great but the food was even better...   For the appetizer we got the Tuna Sashimi Carpaccio - I have never had anything like it before. It was delicious and so fresh that the tuna pieces just melt in your mouth. For our entrees, we split a few rolls:  -Makoto Roll - It's a spicy Yellow tail & Shrimp wrapped with seared tuna in a creamy spicy sauce. It's probably one of the best rolls I've ever tried in my life.  -Rainbow roll, Crunchy Spicy Tuna, and one more that I don't remember. Every roll was unbelievably fresh and done to perfection.   For dessert, we both had cappuccino's and split a dessert - Raspberry bread pudding with Carmel... OH MY!   This was definitely the best meal of the trip and a perfect place for a date!",

    "text": "Sushi Roku is a very elegant and fancy sushi lounge and bar inside Caesars. It is somewhat difficult to find, it is up the escalators past the Forum (the shopping area) and is in one of the corners.  Inside you will see lots of empty space despite an okay number of other diners but the place is so big that there are bound to be many open tables. A nigiri (fish + rice underneath) averages 4-5$ a piece, with a blue fin special they had at the time of 13$ a piece. I expected this to be mind blowing but it was very very average. The salmon belly was super fatty as expected, it tasted super fresh but the texture at the end of the day was just not my thing, but not their fault as I just wanted to try it. The salmon nigiri was good, we ordered a lot of \"regular\" nigiri and those were all solid. The eel one could be a little less cooked but still decent. Overall I would probably not pay that much for this. A friend got some kind of roll for 20$ but it tasted very average as well, I could get the same for 12-15$ in NYC which is really saying something.  The view though is amazing, like a super awesome view of the strip. The lounge is cool as well, you have enough space away from other tables to do your own thing, and the couch chairs are super comfortable (which is also the case at the dining table). Food I would give 2.5 stars given the exorbitant price, but view and atmosphere I would give 4.5.",

    "text": "Having been a frequent visitor to the establishments in LA when I was living down there, I have always had a soft spot for Sushi Roku.  Having been to Sushi Roku a few times in Vegas, this is my first time actually reviewing it!  My fiance and I had dinner here on a Friday night while in town, and Sushi Roku definitely did not disappoint. After getting seated at a table with a beautiful view of the strip, we decided to go with the following:  Drinks: Me: Pear Blossom Him: Salary Man Share: Recommended sake from our waiter  -Tuna Carpaccio: I've said this a number of times (including in my review of Sushi Roku in Santa Monica), this is and has been one of THE best things I've had...ever.  The sesame soy dressing and garlic chips that comes with this makes it absolutely amazing.  As I've said before, if licking the plate was socially acceptable, I would do it, especially for this.  An absolute must-have item.  -Chicken Karaage: Delicious, hot, and crispy, this dish definitely did not disappoint. The delicious wasabi cream that came with this was definitely helpful for this.  -Chutoro sashimi: It's been a really long time since both of us have had quality pieces of fish, and this certainly was worth every bite.  The fish quality was so great, we decided to follow on with another few pieces of Otoro later on.  Definitely nailed both of these sashimi dishes, but the Chutoro was definitely the winner.  -A^2 Fusion Roll: One of the night's specialty rolls with albacore, avocado, and cucumber, I think?  Either way, it wasn't great, and was one of the more disappointing dishes we had that night.  Didn't stop me from eating all of it, but Greg didn't want any part of it.  -Gyoza: Delicious dumplings stuffed with Kobe beef! So amazing! I don't think I've ever had anything like this.  After the tuna carpaccio, this was Greg's second favorite dish.  -Raspberry Bread Pudding: AMAZEBALLS. The dish came with chocolate ice cream on top, and a cream, caramel, and raspberry sauce at the bottom.  With my cappuccino, this was absolutely amazing.  It was definitely a fantastic way to end our meal.  Sushi Roku was definitely everything I remembered and more!  We definitely had a great experience here, and will be coming back for that Tuna Carpaccio!",

The service is excellent, and if you're there for work (boo-yah! expense that junks!) and you can splurge, they know when you're spending money, and you'll find your dessert comped if they can tell that you are dropping some dollars.  Ask for Kenji if you want to feel super duper cool and VIP. Tell him the place came highly recommended by a friend from New York, and you were told to make sure you give him their best. Joke, laugh, exchange business cards. It'll be the cherry on top of the whole experience.  As much as I hate Vegas, it's places like Sushi Roku that make me love Vegas.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "We ate here this past weekend for my Birthday dinner. Overall it's an okay restaurant. The interior decoration is steller and the views of the strip were amazing!  Our waitress also threw in a bottle of sake and if it's your birthday you get this fiery faux drink type thingy and everyone sings happy birthday so I suppose I would recommend for a special occasion.   That being said the food wasn't anything to rave about. Living in SF it's hard to visit another city and not be a culinary snob, but I've eaten at some amazing spots in Vegas and this place did not live up.   When our food arrived it appeared to have been sitting for awhile waiting to be delivered (e.g the sauce looked like something out of a microwave meal and the ginger was browning).  So I wasn't that impressed. The service was mid grade for not being that busy I was a bit suprised by the lack of attentiveness.   If you go expect great ambiance and average food!",

    "text": "Following a friend's recommendations for Sushi Roku, we made dinner reservations for a Saturday night.  Being a self proclaimed sushi nazi, I was very hesitant about going to sushi roku.  I always have issues with going to chain sushi restaurants.  And I also knew a chef who worked at sushi roku...  When we walked in the decor was great, with a great view of the strip.  I ordered my usual list of sushi (uni, yellowtail, toro, albacore, hirame) as well as the Chilean sea bass.  My date ordered the Kobe steak.    The sushi came out first.  We also ordered the special of the night: some special cut of Toro.  The sushi was bland...nothing spectacular.  I could not taste anything special about the Toro.  Very disappointing, considereing we paid $24 for 2 pieces of special Toro.    My Chilean sea bass was cooked very well, flakey and melts in your mouth.  I didn't particularly like the sauce on my fish.  It was supposed to be a truffle miso glaze, but all i tasted was the pineapples of the glaze.  My date's steak came to us dry and well done when we ordered medium rare.  Already disappointed with our experience, I flagged down a waiter and sent the steak back to the kitchen.  The host and staff were very concern about the steak and immediately sent us a new, better cooked steak.    If you do plan to go to Sushi Roku, stick to ordering rolls.  For service, Sushi Roku gets 5 stars.  But sigh....service and decor does not keep my belly happy.",

The atmosphere is definitely \"uppity.\"  Very dark modern feel to it.    Ok, so as far as sushi goes, this place is pricey.  But, we went to Vegas for a friends bday and wanted a nicer place to dine.   Started with the edamame hummus - which had a more watery consistency to it than I am used to.  There was edamame beans in there, which added textures.  I did not, however liked the chips that came with it for scooping.    I tried the spicy tuna and spicy scallop roles.  They were good, I guess.  I think I've had better sushi elsewhere.  My friends raved about the crab dynamite roll, but I didn't try it.  The portions for the BBQ chicken special was so tiny for the price - I couldn't see anyone getting full by it.    The best part of the meal was the dessert.  We told our server one of us was having a bday and they brought two sufferer deserts, and a cool flaming firecracker type candle.  Considering the place was dark, it lit up our table and made for a fun presentation.  Also the desserts were very delicious - a very rich chocolate brownie with ice cream and strawberries, and a fruit blend type of tart, I can't describe too well.  I think this place is more presentation than food quality.",

Had a reservation, but as with the last 2 times I have been here, they are overbooked and there is a long wait.  I'm cool with waiting at the bar, but the bartender hasn't done anything but BS and serve the large group of girls at the end of the bar for the last 45 minutes.  Honestly, the sushi isn't spectacular and the location is tiny, but I wind up getting talked into going here more than I would like to.

I had the salmon and scallop dish here and it was really good.  Everything in the dish went with each other, but I didn't order much because we were going out later that night...drinking...so yeah.  I guess I'd say that this place met my expectations and didn't disappoint.  Service was on par with the status of the restaurant so no complaints there.  But for some reason I couldn't give this place 5 stars.  The food was good but not excellent...if it was excellent I would have ordered more after my first dish.

The yellowtail just melted in your mouth.  Chilean Seabass with Truffle Miso Glaze & Sauteed Spinach: This was my dish...it was seared just right and the truffle miso glaze was so delicious!! I would definitely order this again.  Sauteed Salmon & Hokkaido Scallops; XO sauce with Asparagus & Potatoes: Scallops were cooked perfectly, not chewy or tough.  Katana Roll: Tuna & Yellowtail atop Spicy Tuna & Shrimp Tempura: Great presentation, and the fish was really fresh  Spicy Tuna Hand roll: I wasn't able to try this as it was only for one person.  Grilled Ji-Dori Chicken with Sauteed Mix Mushrooms & Mashed Potatoes: Chicken was extremely tender, great combination with the sauces.   This restaurant is a little pricey but c'mon it's Vegas. The ambiance, the delicious food, and the service is definitely well worth it.",

We're from Southern California so we know good sushi and while this place was absolutely gorgeous inside, I was a little disappointed. I knew it was going to be pricey, but I thought maybe the portions would be a little bigger and the sushi would be more unique. We ordered the jalapeno tuna roll and the scallop roll. The food runner accidentally brought out a roll that we didn't order but he said we could just keep it, so that was a plus! It was good, don't get me wrong, but I've definitely had very similar sushi rolls at numerous restaurants in California. Our server was very nice and our food came out quickly. I would recommend this place for sure, I guess I'm just spoiled when it comes to the sushi places by my house :)",

Also tried the King crab fried rice and that was disappointing as well: not much crab meat and just nothing that special. In general, the food was not bad but I just dislike places that try to make their food seem good by making it super expensive and making the place expensive. One more thing: I came in a group of 7 people and the server helped us all write in our tip....like rude much, if gratuity is included then get it printed...its unprofessional. To describe this place in one word: phony. If you want to have great Asian food, go to Tao (I'm not advertising for Tao btw). I would go back to Tao a thousand times and probably never voluntarily go here again.",

Been here several times and this last time we were a party of 7 in to celebrate a friend's birthday and from start to finish the service was excellent & attentive. Great view of the strip from where our table was located. The food & drinks though are what keep me coming back. The menu changes so even for us regulars there's always something new to be tied. I had the edamame hummus (only because I love both edamame & hummus & was curious about it) & crispy rice asparagus appetizers.  Next was the Kurobuta Pork \"Kakuni\" (braised pork belly) & my main was the Filet Mignon with Ginger Teriyaki sauce.  The hummus was great though they should serve it with a few more wonton chips than they do as those ran out long before the hummus did.  They did however bring out a few more chips when asked.  The crispy rice asparagus was  prepared and served as you would expect, and while it was good, it wasn't as memorable as other dishes the table ordered. The Kakuni on the other hand was my favorite dish of the night (and that's also including all the dishes of my dining companions that I also tried). All you pork belly fans, this is one of the best preparations I've ever had of this fatty delectable treat. The Filet was served sliced alongside mashed potatoes & garlic green beans...the Filet was perfectly cooked and seasoned perfectly! A phenomenal dinner was had by all!   Also if you like cocktails that are sweet, definitely get the cookies & cream & pineapple upside down cake cocktails...phenomenal!  Already looking forward to my next return visit to Sushi Roku!",

I recommend the asparagus wrapped in filet mignon as an appetizer. The tofu steak entree is also a fine compliment to any main course. My ginger lychee mojito was fabulous and I suggest you order one or several with your meal. Sushi Roku strives for excellence and always delivers it!  Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!!!!!!! Dana F. 12/26/12",

They created an adhoc table out in the front to accommodate which was unusual but great for last minute.  The food was excellent. Very tasty and even though the waitress said that kitchen was behind, came out in perfect tempo. The miso cod was exquisite, not new but cooked excellent. Loved the brussell sprouts and the sashimi was very fresh. Great evening spent.",

    "text": "Yeah yeah yeahhhh...it's another chain sushi place.  I know.  But I really think it deserves five stars from me because we had such a great experience here!  When I go to restaurants in Vegas, I admit that I typically don't expect much from the wait staff.  There's usually some type of \"air\" about them as if they're above everybody else because they work at a restaurant on the Vegas Strip.  My visit to Sushi Roku pleasantly surprised me.  Our server, whose name I unfortunately forget (I blame Vegas brain, hard to remember), was amazing.  He recommended a Saki that was delicious, and he even offered us tastings of sashimi and another type of Saki on the house!  He truly went above and beyond what I would expect from a dining experience in Vegas, let alone anywhere else.  Also, the view in this restaurant is pretty nice if you sit in the room with all the glass windows.  One of my friends was in Vegas for his first time, and he was able to enjoy a nice view down the strip from our table.",

Well there isn't really much of that here so I'm not entirely sure what you're paying for.  It's definitely another to be seen place, but it's not even very good at that. It's in the forum shops for one ... and they just can't seem to decide what kind of restaurant they truly are.   The sushi rice is terrible, and the sashimi is hit or miss.

We made lunch reservations for 2:30 and thank goodness day drinking had not really started because we wandered around the forum shops for 45 minutes just trying to find the 3rd floor. Ok I am a little challenged with reading maps but I'm sure it would have been way longer if I was buzzed. Finally arriving on the third floor we were seated immediately. I ordered the sake sampler...so good!!! And started with the King Crab fried rice, by far the best fried rice we have ever had in our lives. I had the nigiri lunch combo with a spicy tuna roll and my fiancee had the fried tuna rolls. Everything was just exceptional! I will definitely be back for lunch or dinner on my next Vegas trip! Sushi is after all my favorite thing to eat!!",

We had dinner reservations after the Celine Dion show and they sat us 20 minutes early which was great. Our table had a beautiful view down the strip but we found the atmosphere to be very rowdy. I know that's Vegas but geez I wish there was such a thing as a classy drunk.  We weren't sure how hungry we were so we shared california rolls, spicy tuna rolls, and a baked lobster roll (which was expensive but very different!). The signature drinks were also some of the best we've ever had anywhere (try the Tokyo Cooler!). Because it was after 10 PM the place wasn't packed so I would've liked a little more attention from our waitor, especially because we like ordering sushi on an as we go basis so we don't over order. Overall the food and drinks were great, but maybe I'd come here at an earlier hour for a different crowd and experience.",

    "text": "Nothing thrilled us. Either we are terribly unlucky, or we really didn't order anything right that night. Here are the issues I have with this place:   1. The ambiance is dark and when I say dark, I mean I can't see my date's face let alone see anything on my table 2. The menu is short, not too much creativity here 3. I don't care if we have to pay a Vegas tourist premium, just give us quality food and a memorable experience - yet they failed at that here. Although the nigiri was of great quality, we really don't feel the overall value is here whatsoever  Here's what we settled with:   Miso soup $6 - two tablespoons served lukewarm with a miniature bit of tofu and nonexistent seaweed. Yep, I am pretty much sipping on warm, salty water. Skip it. Flavor rating: 2/5  Makoto roll $22 (spicy yellowtail & shrimp tempura wrapped with seared tuna spicy creamy sauce) - Sloppily rolled with lots of rice, minimal fish, and no wow-worthy sauce or flavor attributes. The roll ingredients and sauce were all too dry and bland. I was missing any trace of spicy yellowtail or even seared tuna, that's for sure. Flavor rating: 2/5  Soft shell Crab roll $15 - The soft shell crab had excellent flavor,yet a tad too soggy for my preference. Again, why was the roll so shoddily put together? We did not dine on a busy evening (Tuesday night, close to closing), so there is no real excuse. Flavor rating: 3/5  Salmon Nigiri $8.50 - The salmon was sweet and fresh, yet, they were not generous with the cuts. What felt like a paper-thin, cheap cut was a tease in the end. Flavor rating: 3/5  Uni Nigiri $14 - The uni was vibrant and fresh, but again tiny portion, why would you ever need to pay $14 for uni nigiri, I will never know. It's not like you can't get it anywhere else as fresh, since you totally can for MUCH cheaper. Flavor rating: 3/5  We made the wrong step when we decided to be seated in the dining room floor with an awkward angle of the strip view. We might have ended up on a thrilling note if we dined along the sushi bar. For the same price point, I would have had more bang for my buck and a completely satisfied palate at Nobu. Eh, well you live and you learn.",

I asked her where the kimchee was and she said the kimchee is mixed with the vinegar. I was slightly disappointed. She asked if I wanted to send it back and I said no it's fine, I'd give it a try. I took a bite and wow! It was so delicious. Tons of flavor. Seconds later our waitress arrived as she was notified I wasn't 100% pleased with the cucumber salad. I was super impressed they were so attentive to my needs. Our waitress also offered to swap it out for something else and while I told her it was different than what I had expected that it was totally delicious. They really wanted to make sure I was happy with what I had ordered.  Following my appetizer I ordered the baked lobster roll and some albacore sashimi. It was out of this world! The baked lobster roll is drizzled with hollandaise sauce. So delicious! And the albacore was so fresh and served with an amazing garlic ponzu sauce.  Our waitress checked on us several times. She was so sweet and really wanted to make sure we had a good experience. I will definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas. Next time I will try to leave room to try some dessert.",

It was hard for me to find the restaurant because I entered at the Ceasar's Palace entrance and had to walk like 8-10mins to this restaurant was. So if you are coming here via taxi/cab, make sure they drop you at the entrance closest to the restaurant itself.  To the Menu- They have a nice variety of food here. Some people ordered sushi but if that doesn't tickle your fancy no worries.  Tasty items I particularly remembered- Eggplant Dengaku (So yummy) Edamame Roasted Cauliflower Steamed Shrimp Dumplings  There were a variety of sushi items ordered which I did not taste but everybody enjoyed their meal.",

The rice on the rolls were Way overcooked so we were left with mushy rolls.  For such a nice location this sushi restaurant is a disappointment!",

The waiter took our drink order and asked if we wanted to order edamame while we looked at the menu- loved that! I always forget. We got salmon and tuna sashimi and two tolls. The shrimp roll with salmon and the eel. Despite dining in a dessert, the sushi was fresh and delicious.  Tables along the wall gave one person a view outside of the strip.  It was conveniently located in the Forum shops. I would come here again.",

Our server was so attentive and knowledgeable and really made us all feel like he cared about our table. Everyone ordered alcoholic beverages, which were strong and tasty, and miso soup to start. We then ordered individual meals and the server happily split up our tab accordingly.  I ordered the Katana Roll: Spicy Tuna and Shrimp Tempura topped with Tuna and Yellowtail for $23 and it was delicious. It was spicy, but the roll was large (8 pieces) and plenty to fill me up. The Signature Rolls all came with 6-8 pieces depending on their contents and the other Rolls came with 4-6 depending on their content.   I would highly recommend Sushi Roku for a romantic dinner, night out with friends, etc. it has everything you need. The ambiance was slightly dark, but worked perfectly with the Las Vegas Strip right outside the window lighting everything up. Best meal we had during our stay.",

Service was really good, and we got a popcorn shrimp roll and 2 bowls of ramen. It was a bit pricey for both, but expected. The roll was simple and tasted good. The ramen, the broth was a tad heavy, noodles weren't chewy, but overall, it wasn't bad. It hit the spot for what it was worth, but obviously for the $, you can get better at a hole in the wall. Great view of the strip, so good if you're looking to spend some moola for sushi.",

I started off with Brussel chips and they weren't what I expected so I brought my AMAZING waitress Juliet  and told her what I was looking for and boy did she deliver. From the moment we walked in it was pure delight I'll be back again and again for the one of a kind experience.

The service was good as was the food- we got salads, brussel sprouts, calamari, sushi and ramen! Since we were celebrating birthdays, they gifted us complimentary desserts which was the best part of the meal! We got the cotton candy Carnavale, this lights up on fire and the cotton candy burns down leaving a surprise dessert in the middle! We also got the chocolate lava cake which was superb. Definitely recommend- great for groups, couples, whatever...! Great view, great service!",

He couldn't choose either, so we got all three and were really happy we did. We each had a diff tuna dish as our fav with the salmon being number two for both of us...the sauces were all slightly different and each had a ton of flavor. Each only had three pieces so it was very manageable to have all three  Service was great, we both agreed we would go back to have full meals off the menu.",

The Lobster Garlic Noodles were a disappointment. The menu stated Udon Noodles however the dish came with a fettuccine type noodle. It was more of a pasta dish and was too sweet and had no garlic flavor.  However, there were plenty of big chunks of lobster. Over all this was a great dining experience. The service was great.

We were a party of 4 for lunch and a 3 of us wanted to try a few different things so 3 of us opted for the \"premium\" $85 per person chefs special selection (after our waiter convinced us it was a good value). There was jut one issue...he brought the last plate of the selection and we were all still hungry. Does it seem ok to spend almost $400 on a lunch and feel like you need a Big Mac after? It was also irritating to pay $85 per person and have them bring 2 pieces of something or a roll cut in half. Should there not be 3 of everything? One person was always left out. It was very odd and  seemed cheap...like they couldn't make 2 rolls and give one extra piece they would make one and cut it in half. Very unbecoming for an upscale place in the high end Caesar's Forum Shops to come across as cheap. The cocktails were good my matcha mule was 3/4 ice, but delicious.  Lesson learned- skip the chefs selection. I could have selected $85 worth of sushi that would have satisfied the table. I won't leave that up to \"the chef\" again.",

We had dinner this time, and Sushi Roku slayed!  First, we were completely surprised by the large and elegant dining room with expansive views of the Strip and the LINQ (we had eaten at the sushi bar last time).   We  started with the hamachi serrano.  The hamachi was sliced thin and melted in our mouths, and the serrano chiles gave it a nice pop of heat - which was cooled by the ponzu.   Next we shared the Brussels Sprouts chips; NOT YOUR MOM's Brussels!!!  They flash-fried the leaves and seasoned them with salt and truffle oil...crispy, salty, delicious.  This dish paired perfectly with the Mer Soleil Chardonnay (which they serve by the glass...rarely done anywhere) or a cold sake.  We shared 2 sushi rolls: the classic spider roll and the crunchy spicy tuna tempura roll.  The latter was genius and addictive.  The roll is filled with fresh ahi & avo (and I think asparagus?) then rolled in tempura, deep fried, then cut and served.  So you get hot & cool, soft and crunchy - all in one bite!  My only ding would be that the wine pours were a bit anemic for a Vegas restaurant (6 OZ).",

    "text": "I've been to Sushi Roku twice. Both times have been fantastic. The fish was great, and the service was excellent.   I feel like there is a knack to having the best possible experience here.   1) eat the fish in the right order 2) spend a lot 3) avoid the rolls at all cost, they're terrible. 4) the beef  We went through 3 or 4 bottles of sake, which was poured for us as often as we poured each other's. Exceptionally friendly service from everyone who helped at our table.  The fish is excellent. A lot of fish is fairly delicate, so eating from mild to pungent is important. Hamachi after mackerel is not going to be ideal. A little experience is necessary because they're just going to bring what you order. You can also ask your server, and they'll be happy to guide you.  Highlight of my last trip was the beef served with hot cast iron pucks to cook it on. Ridiculously tender and tasty. Right up there with the best steaks to be found in Vegas, but in a few tender little bites instead of an entire cut. I would happily eat this every day for the next 60 years.  Ambience is nice. I didn't notice it being too dark as another reviewer mentioned, but we arrived before sunset and were there for over 2 hours so we probably adjusted.  Having had 2 exceptional visits, I'm always happy to recommend Roku to people and even happier when I get a chance to go again myself.",

The sushi selection is relatively small compared to other cities, but I guess you'd expect that in the middle of a desert?  I don't know...  But I went with the japanese short ribs appetizer for my meal because we didn't expect to eat a full meal.  It was so good I asked for a side of rice to soak up every bit of the juice/sauce that it was with.  The rolls my dining parter had were good, too.  The service was OK - not incredibly attentive but not bad either.  I imagine on a busy night (there were only a few people at the time) it could get slow.",

We just arrived in Vegas and were looking for a nice place to sit, relax and enjoy a satisfying meal.  We happened upon Sushi Roku and decided to give it a try.  We had a window view of the strip.  Not only that but the food was fantastic as well as the service.  I'm a vegetarian and was there with two co-workers who were not.   The waiter was very helpuful at answering my questions about the dishes.  I ordered a couple of appetizers because that's about all there was that was veg. The waiter was great about letting me know that we could start out with just a couple of the small dishes (salad & an eggplant dish),   He said if they were not sufficient he'd put in an orer for an additional dish.  That really impressed me. Often when I order veggie dishes the waiters will act like they think I'll be starving.  Not here!!  And my meal was more than sufficient.  And oooooh, so good!! The Miso Eggplant appetizer was especially delish.    I'm so glad we decided to take the chance and stop here.",

    "text": "First night in Vegas and we were looking for something light to eat before hitting up the club.  Nobu was booked, so we decided to try Sushi Roku.  Reservations weren't hard to get and I had heard good things so it was a go.  We decided to order a bunch of appetizers and small plates to share for four guys.  One could't eat meat due to lent and I couldn't have carbs. Even with those restrictions we were successful in getting some tasty dishes.    The Truffle Edamame was really tasteful, but you can't really go wrong when its sprinkled with truffle oil, yum!  Shishito peppers were okay, I've had better (at Nobu, haha).    Yellowtail Diced Chilies were really fresh and tasty.  I good balance of flavors with a not too tangy sauce to compliment the delicate yellowtail flavore.  The highlight of the show was teh Chilean Seabass Truffle Miso Glaze!  Delicious.  I have never met a Miso Glaze I did not like, but add truffle to it, and I was in heaven.  Went perfect with the smooth like butter seabass (i kinda wish the black cod had the truffle miso glaze, but it was only described as Sweet Miso, so I passed).    Other items we got were the Uni Tartlette (couldn't eat the pastry so just at the inside. Small, and flavor no so Uni-ish.  The sweet shrimp (Amaebi) was really fresh and the fried shrimp heads with it were the perfect compliment, Fresh and Fried.    We also got rolls, but i didn't partake because of the rice.  All in all, Sushi Roku is pretty good.  Flavors really stood and were well balanced.  Service was excellent as to be expected.  Price was a bit on the high end for what it was but that's normal for Vegas.  I would come back (unless I have a reservation for Nobu).",

For sushi, I love the lobster roll with miso sauce, and any type of sashimi is fresh and delectable.   If you are a local, you know there are items that can be ordered off the menu. All are delicious, but the white lotus roll is my absolute favorite.   If you are in the mood for some upscale sushi in a quiet environment with a great view of Vegas, Sushi Roku is for you.

So we headed down to Ceasar's for this spot, and were well rewarded.  Service is very friendly - we walked right in and sat at the bar. We ended up ordering a decent selection of nigiri, as well as a spicy tuna, spicy shrimp, and white lotus roll. I also had my standard seaweed salad, which was excellent, although tasted a little like there was a fruit dressing, which I could have done without. Maneki in Seattle still has my all time favorite sunomono.  Rolls were very good, especially the white lotus roll, which, if I'm remembering right, was crispy shrimp, avocado, and asparagus inside, with yellow tail on the outside, fresh hot peppers, and some various sauces. Awesome. I'm really starting to like the fresh peppers in sushi, which I'm seeing in more and more spots. Also worth mentioning, the hamachi I had here is maybe the best I've had. Super tender, super flavorful, just awesome.  Price was excellent too - they left an item off our bill by accident and when we reminded them, they just waved it off. Even with that on the bill, for two people including a couple drinks, the total came to under $100. No, not cheap, but it's sushi...in Las Vegas...and we ate ourselves full. Definitely a would return.",

I asked the hostess if we could have the happy hour menu and she went to ask the manager, then she came back and told us we had to move to another table. There were on the other side and there was no beautiful view and we sat beside a big group of table who were very loud, we had to speak up to talk to each other. Anyways, the food was pretty good and fresh. I cannot remember what we ordered but the price were reasonable and we had a nice time.",

My aunt and uncle brought me here, considering my aunt is not a sushi eater, so my uncle had a sushi partner lol. Omg.....delicious. amazing. Even the saki was really good except I requested it be chilled. And it was on the sweeter more milder side. People the host there was as fabulous as they get. He was such a diva lol! Ok! Now back to the food. My aunt from what I recall ordered a filet that she loved and my uncle and I chowed down on all kinds of sushi. It was amazing. Wish I lived closer lol! Xoxo",

    "text": "Most of the stars that Sushi Roku receives are for its amazing view of the Las Vegas Strip. No doubt about it, my sights were pleased with my experience, beautiful view, beautiful people, beautiful Vegas....  Sushi Roku is like Ra sushi disguised as a Nobu. Adequately fresh fish with subpar textures and preparations for stellar prices. Granted, the miso glazed popcorn shrimp and black pepper kobe beef skewer are standalone wonders, they would be better off in a restaurant that doesn't call itself SUSHI Roku. I guess I should have known something was amiss when the non-sushi appetizers were so astounding. Sushi Roku did rebound well, though, with its fantastic chocolate cake, which was discussed at the table as possibly the best chocolate cake ever tasted, or maybe it was the vanilla bean cream, or maybe..it was because we munched on the decadent dream while peering at the most decadent town in the western United States.",

    "text": "\"Try everything you want on the menu. I mean it. Try everything, don't hesitate now.\" Those were the exact words that came out of my mouth as I was sitting at Sushi Roku in Ceasar's with a Roku virgin. I first found out about Sushi Roku in Los Angeles located on 3rd and Croft by the Beverly Center and I was hooked. It's no Nobu guys, it's no Matsuhisa, it blows them out of the water.  First I had kimchee (pickeled cabbage) stuffed cucmber salad. Perfectly crunchy, salty, sweet, spicy. I could pop those in my mouth all day like potato chips. You just can't have one. The tofu steak was next with grilled mushroom au jus. Just outta this world. Perfectly done tofu with three types of mushroom, light, complex, and not overly filling which was perfect because we were seated at a table for two and between her and me we had ordered for four, at least.   The tastings started to come, and the sashimi, and the specialty rolls I requested not on the menu from the head chef at the sushi bar. Baby tako that melted in your mouth. Hamachi that glistened and we swear could have been still moving it was so fresh. The fish was like butter. Even the edamamde isn't oversaled, isn't overcooked. It's fresh, light and absolutely perfect. The tempura can be ordered separately or as a combo, which means that I can order six broccoli and sweet potato pieces, which is always what I eat last on my tempura plate because I think it's the best.   My sake was excellent. Nigori, which is unfiltered, was exactly what I asked for, salty, sweet, and heavy. Like a creamy dream, my alcohol was a match made perfect by the suggestion of my extremely helpful and quick waitress. The service is fantastic.   The decor is wonderful. If you're by the windows you can see the strip and all it's glory at night. But look around. Private raised booths that still create intimate feelings are against the back wall. My table was close to others around me, but we didn't care. We talked with the couple next to us about how fabulous their food was and weren't they looking forward to flying back out to Vegas from NYC just to eat here. Of course, their answer was an excited \"Yes!\".   This Roku is much better than the Los Angeles one in my opinion and I've eaten frequently at both locations. This is some of the best sushi I have ever eaten on the west coast. I will always go back. My name is in the computer system permanently, I always get a great table, and my people there take care of me.   Live the good life ya'll. Sushi Roku is a gem in a luxury \"mall\". Have a few beverages and order \"a la Danielle\". Seriously, take one of everything. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "There's a sushi roku in L.A close to where I live but I never got a chance to try it out. Glad I did it in Vegas.  Met a friend (then turned date I guess). We were thinking about what to eat for lunch. After a few minutes of discussion, we chose to have sushi. I wanted to have sushi, and my friend said said he loves sushi too. So we drove down the strip, not the fasted way to get somewhere but it gave us time to find a good restaurant. I was looking for recommendations on Yelp, the top choices are all open only for dinner, and then I found sushi roku. Great, I thought. And conveniently, we were right by the entrance of Ceasars Palace.   It was a long walk from self-parking garage. Most of the casinos are extremely self-parking unfriendly. The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of The Forum Shop. The closest entrance would be the main one on the strip, but we walked all the way through the casino. (I'm not a big fan of Ceasars Palace so touring around wasn't exciting to me.)  The hostess took us in and let us chose our own table. We sat down at the very back of the restaurant by the windows. It was a nice view, you can see the happening strip. (But not anything close to the view you would get in your own room at some nice hotels like I've had.) Since they're open for lunch, we ordered some lunch items as well as some specialty rolls. We also tried sashimi. They had two kinds of meat there - Blue Fin is the more premium one, but we had both. Needless to say, blue fin tastes so much better. It is more tender. I love the feeling that it's like melting in your mouth as you're eating it. But my friend prefered the other, he thought there was more texture on it and he likes to chew a little bit. Blue fin is just too soft for him. The sushi we had was beyond ok, but not even close to the best I've had. Except for one. Unfortunately I forgot what it's called as I always order something I've never tried before. And usually I don't even know which is which when they present it. But the service there was really really good, our server explained to us thoroughly on every dish we had. (Still I can't remember the names..) I would give the sushi a 4 star.  For dessert we had mochi since my friend had never had it before. It was $10 but there were only 3 mochi, each was cut in half. For the same money you could buy two packages of some better ones at an Asian supermarket. But the way they put everything together and decorated it justified the price. It looked amazingly beautiful and somehow romantic. If you're there with a date, go for the mochi. I guarantee it'll be a good choice.   And what's better than a meal with a date that actually enjoyed the food? Discount! When we were about to get our check, I asked our waiter whom we had been chatting with throughout the whole time if we could get any discount had we been staying at the hotel.(I remember seeing coupons were given out upon checkin at casinos. They wanna tie you in.) Btw our server was very very attentive as the whole place was almost empty. If I didn't have to meet with my friend I would've probably been hangover too in the afternoon. But I'm I wasn't. It was nice spending time with my friend together. Before I could finish my question, he said:\"you're already getting a discount.\" It turned out that since we had been chatting so much, he gave us a local discount(which you can find at many places in Vegas) considering my friend was moving there. Nice, so we had 20% off of our total bill. Couldn't be happier about that. It was MLK day and I had a wonderful African-American server.  As we were leaving, my friend and I got confused whether we just had lunch or dinner. It was already dark outside and we probably sat in there for 2 and a half hours which we really didn't feel long at all. We concluded it as our early dinner, even though my friend said it could be he's breakfast since he hadn't eaten anything before that. And then we started getting closer and made out.. It was incredible feeling a cute guy who's also got a hot hot body.  This is not just a review, it's also a journal I'm writing about our first meet because I know \"you\"(my cute date) could be reading what other people are saying about this place after you got home. If you did read this, consider it a secret way I'm telling you I really had a good time with you being my foodie companion. So looking forward to exploring more restaurants with you ;)",

Sushi Roku is a \"High-End Sushi\" Joint, but with good quality sushi.  Which hardly is the case at a lot of other High-End Sushi places.  The sushi was fresh, portions were fair sized, appetizers were delish, and service was excellent.    I recommend the Toro & Jalapeno Handroll.  It tastes like butter. MMMMMM.  Very pricey, don't come here after a losing streak.  -1 star for price.  Seacrest Out!",

    "text": "The sister and I took our parents to Vegas for their first time, and to also attend Paris By Night, a Vietnamese music production. They're not too crazy on trying strange things, and by strange--I mean anything that strays away from Vietnamese cuisine. They have traditional tastebuds, but still willing to try flavors closely related to their usual liking. This led me to choosing Japanese, because they've never tried much of it. Plus, I wanted to take them to a cool spot, which most trendy Japanese restaurants can accommodate to, to end their awesome day of music, and to make full use of their play-dressed-up night--dad in a suit, and mom in a purdeee dress.   Service- 5! - I called ahead to set reservation, and requested seating near the window to enjoy the view of the strip since it was my parents first time in Vegas--they were so nice and accommodating. I had to call back and change timing since the concert took much longer than anticipated; they were more than glad to meet our request.  As for the actual dining experience, our server was sweet and helpful. Took her advice on several dishes and it was on point. She even went along with me when I wanted to get my folks to take 2 plum sake shots [they're the one light drink only people]. She told my dad it was a 'pink juice shot', when he asked her what it was. LOL. Too bad I forgot her name, but I remember her a very small frame Japanese lady. On top of that, the manager [a korean fella] came to our table to greet and also at the end, to see how our dinner went. Very nice touch.  Ambience- 4 - The decor wasn't what I'd go 'WOW!' about, but it was definitely still an artistic and trendy architectural attempt. Great view of the strip, mellow, and warm. The way the restaurant was design, you actually don't need a window seat to have a glimpse of the streets down below.  Food- 4 - Our food was great, but the overall effect didn't leave me thinking, \"An amazing dinner!\"  Apps: 1) Yellowtail sashimi w diced chilies 2) mixed sashimi salad w ginger vinaigrette 3) agedashi tofu [it's off the menu, but can be requested] 4) Popcorn rock shrimp tempura in spicy miso glaze 5) miso cod  - the yellowtail could have been fresher, but the sauce & toppings were delicious/ salad & sashimi was a great blend w the dressing/ soy sauce in the agedashi tofu was so little, but the tofu itself was soft and perfectly battered/popcorn rock shrimp ROCKED! SO DELICIOUSSSS. Much better than nobu's/ miso cod was tender, juicy & fresh, but could use a bit more glaze   Entree: 1) Ribeye w/ soy garlic sauce 2) Chilean sea bass ( in yuzu butter, they have 2 different sea bass dishes, and both sauce are different] - ribeye was yummy, had it medium but the little cooked part was quite dry. my folks and sister loved it and the baby green beans & potatoes that came along w it/ the seabass was perfectly flavored, but texture was a bit dry, perhaps an older piece of fish?  Dessert: mochi & a 10oz carafe of plum sake  - no restaurant can possibly go wrong w mochi....and roku didn't. we were too fulll at the end to eat much dessert, so I figure this was an appropriate portion.  Overall, we all had a lovely evening. My parents had so much fun and enjoyed the restaurant's experience--along w the kirin light and cocktail I ordered for them [hehe]. I would definitely return, but not before I've tried other sushi joints in Vegas [can't help it, there is just too much to eat a one place twice in Vegas. unless you live there or go there 50 times a year!]",

    "text": "The main reason I'm giving 5 stars is for the Bluefin Sashimi that they do topped with shaved black truffles, truffle oil, microgreens, and parmesan cheese. It's an unexpected flavor combo, but it is downright euphoric and should not be missed. I can actually say that this is the best sushi dish I've ever eaten and it's hard to go back to eating sashimi sans truffles. When Bluefin is not in season, you can get it with regular tuna or salmon and they are both amazing. It's not always on the menu, but if you ask, they'll make it. I've tried ordering this dish at other Sushi Roku locations, but instead of using shaved black truffles, they use a measely amount of these sorry crumbled truffle bits. It just doesn't compare.  The other 5 star dish is the Tempura Fried Green Tea Ice Cream. Its a chunk of ice cream encased in a little  spongecake \"box\" which is then dipped in tempura batter and deep fried. It's also topped with a little raspberry sauce drizzle and garnished with fresh berries. The cake insulates the ice cream so it doesn't melt when they fry it. Not only is the flavor outstanding, but the crunchy tempura combined with the softest spongecake I've ever had is pure heaven.  Some of the other dishes here are just kind of so-so and they are usually quite salty. I LOVE the spicy tuna on crispy rice at Katsu-ya, so when I saw that item on the menu here, I was excited to try it. Unfortunately theirs is extremely greasy so be prepared to blot the hell out of it.",

Companion had the chef's sushi combination ($29). I was going for mostly plain and simple, nothing outrageous or innovative. What I got was plain and simple, I felt like I was eating good quality fish. And I'd never had a spicy scallop roll before and liked it.  Our edamame was really good. More firm than most other places I've tried, and I think the firmness was a very good thing. I also loved the doors to the restrooms, which were designated by beautiful tattooed body art on a man and a woman.   I did think they were a little stingy on the wasabi and ginger. When we asked for more, the wasabi brought to us was really hard and crumbly, almost gritty. A bit of a mellow harsher there.  With some sake, sapporo, tea, nibbles and our sushi, the bill for two was about $100. Overall, I thought it was a good meal, but the food itself did not impress me enough to say it was the best I've had. Nowhere near.  It was similar to what I'd get at restaurants in my own city, but served on black pebbles in a hip atmosphere.",

Whenever someone left to use the ladies room, he would come to our table, pick up their napkin, and put it nicely folded on the table... and then chat it up w/ us. hehe.  When we realized this, we started taking turns being the 'decoy' and he would come to our table every time without fail.  haha jk i'm exaggerating.. sorta ;)  ... 11 girls in Vegas need some form of entertainment at all times I suppose.

    "text": "We hit up Sushi Roku Saturday night before heading to Pure for my cousin's birthday. We wanted to have a nice meal that will be just enough to fill us without making have to unbuckle my belt and go for a siesta. Since it's inside of Caesar's it's the perfect location to eat before hopping off to the club. The ambiance was lovely, the waiters were uber friendly (and very cute) and the food was top notch. Their Usuzukuri (thinly sliced of fluke with ponzu sauce) is to die for!!!   It's a bit pricey, but the free birthday dessert of assorted mochi ice cream and the little fireworks show they threw in added that special touch. Be sure to check out their wine list, its ace! I had a phenomenal glass of Riesling that I'm still thirsty for!!!",

Sat at the sushi bar as we do in all sushi establishments and had a good time with the chef's and staff.  Tempura lobster is very good.  Loved the Aji.  I will be back for more from Sushi Roku.",

We had the sushi sampler for $65 and when it came, I saw some unusual combinations and thought to myself, \"Oh no, this had better not be some kind of Americanized sushi like Californian rolls...\" Well, it wasn't. The truffle addition truly worked, bravo. We also like the bartender and the friendly atmosphere. The only thing that I didn't like was the noodles; after all, this place is where you go for sushi, not ramen.",

I think I am just too spoilt going to Sushi Deli in San Diego which is hands down the best sushi place on earth. The sushi here was just okay to me. I got the black truffle roll because it sounded awesome and someone else suggested it on here. It tasted like absolutely nothing to me. It wasn't bad, it just tasted like crunchy cardboard. We also accidentally ordered cold sake which is quite possibly one of the grossest tasting things you could ever drink. Overall the sushi was fine, but I wouldn't come here again to be completely honest.",

We had blue fin o toro and makuro, the fish was pretty fresh, however not surprisingly good. Despite the size of sushi being too small, the major problem this restaurant had was that the sushi rice was not good. The portion of rice and sticky rice was off, so the sushi rice was not tiny sour-ish nor sticky enough. The decoration of the restaurant was really nice but I don't think I will visit again.",

    "text": "I love Sushi Roku.  A friend and I decided to get lunch here one day because we didn't want to fall pit to the \"we're in Vegas, let's have buffet\" like we did the time before.  I had had Sushi Roku one time a couple years ago, but wanted to try it again.  We were promptly greeted and sat at the sushi bar.  The chef was great.  I threw out a couple suggestions of what I like, but wanted to have his recommendation as to what I should have.  Although they didn't have ankimo this time, he did recommend a few other dishes.    The tako roll was really tasty, but the nigiri I had was by far better.  The katsuo was one of the best preparations I've had in a very long time, light sauce and onion, perfect!  Katsuo is my favorite fish, and actually one of the cheaper ones.  It wasn't even on the menu here, but he had it! =)  I next wanted to have a full aji (i.e. sashimi, nigiri, and then the filet is deep-fried), but the aji was already filleted, so I decided to just have a couple pieces seared.  The next was a great recommendation of saiko sake.  Saiko sake is what the Japanese consider to be the best salmon in the world; this salmon comes from New Zealand.  I normally don't care for fattier fish, but this was exquisite.  I admit the food here is a little pricey, so make sure to get the good stuff.  If you want California rolls go somewhere else.  If you want to be adventurous and have high-quality sushi, this is the spot.",

    "text": "My experience with this place was quite mixed, but overall I had to give them 4 stars. Here's why: At first the experience was NOT good: -We were seated next to a huge party that was so loud I couldn't even hear my friends. The place was full so we weren't able to switch tables and it really ruined the whole dining experience because we couldn't even talk to each other! -Food took foooorever to come out and, when it did, some of it was missing and some of it was wrong. The tempura veggies weren't even cooked! But they did a LOT to try to make it better: -They comped our veggies and brought us complimentary tempura shrimp and shots for the table -The manager came over and personally apologized for the loudness and the mishaps we'd had with our food And overall, the service was great considering how busy the place was. The food did take a long time to come out, but we weren't in a rush so it was fine. In terms of quality food - the tempura shrimp were amazing! The specialty sushi rolls were great, but the regular rolls were nothing special (literally nothing to them - could make them at home yourself). I'd say don't waste money on the \"regular\" rolls - get the specialty ones! They're pricier, but you get more (8 pieces instead of 5 or 6) and with many more flavor combinations, sauces, etc. So overall I'd say to give the place a chance. It has good food, good service, and good drinks.",

The experience and food itself was so perfect that my boss and I came back the following night!  Let me just tell you- I rarely eat sushi- not that I don't eat it but its because I never had a memorable moment with it until I ate at Sushi Roku.  The highlights of my night:  1. The view- I'm all about the views and for my first time in Vegas at eating on the third floor of Caesars Palace really set the mood for the night. 2. The service was outstanding. Our server gave us his favorite meals, suggestions and the food was prepared in a timely manner.  3. We ordered Scallops with Foie Gras and White Truffle Oil, Spicy Tuna Rolls, Pot Stickers and Chilean Sea bass. 4. The second night we ordered the Pot Stickers and Chilean Seabass again because it was that good.  Now that I found out Sushi Roku is in LA I will be having dinner there all the time! Next time I'm in Vegas this is definitely the dinner spot I will always go to. Thank you for the experience and best dinner Sushi Roku!",

Now considering it is on the Strip, there are tourists who can act like tourists. We saw a group yelling \"saki bomb\" and then made a mess, which the servers had to clean. I was embarrassed for them. I understand it is the Strip and would not hold it against this place.   For us, the servers were friendly and helpful. One friend who does not do sushi, enjoyed other their tempura. This place has something for everyone.",

We got the oyster shooters, beef appetizer, pork belly fried rice, a red sun roll and bake blue crab hand roll then topped it off with their carnival cheesecake dessert. I wanted to try that carnival cheesecake so bad with the cotton candy melting in front of us and it did not disappoint. The manager came around as we were having dessert already and when he found out it's for a bday he apologized that they had missed that part of the info, he brought out a sparkler and helped us take some photos and gave us the dessert on the house. He didn't have to but that just made everything even that much better. Next time I will bring my husband and parents for them to try the food.",

They recommend to not use soy sauce as every sushi piece has it's own flavors.  The service is unfortunately slow. Just to give you an idea our appetizer were delivered before our drinks!

Their price seemed very reasonable when looking at the menu, but when we got the actual food, we were somewhat disappointed with their portion. They literally provide sample portions of their actual food at somewhat reduced price. I do not recommend any roles, as I thought they were like AYCE sushi quality. Very small 6 pieces of roles for 6-8 dollars. I don't know how much they would actually charge for the same role during non-HH price- so go ahead if you want to risk it.   Also, their fried calamari was very oily and sweet level was to the max. Their wagyu wrapped asparagus was very good, but again, only 4 pieces of half asparagus were offeres. Their drinks are \"hotel\" HH price.   The one thing that I would definitely go back for is their MUSHROOM TEMPURA!! That was the best fried shitakes ever. They were deep fried softly with an essense of truffle oil. So good that I can still smell it!   Their service is just average, nothing stands out. I would recommend places lime sushi Ra or other local places if anyone is craving sushi for HH prices and is looking at this place.",

But all smiles and great service and it's so cold to talk to the sushi chefs because they know so much about the fish and the traditions and everything and it's really cool to check out different fish from all over the world.

The calamari was good and different from the calamari I'm used to.  The jalapeno glaze gave it a tangy crunchy flavor, which makes it unique.  We ordered 2 rounds of that.    The endamame, I was expecting to have more spices added on to it.  There was barely any salt.    Got the foie gras skewer as an appetizer.  It was just a small skewer wrapped in asparagus.  Tasty, but for the price, I wish I got more than a skewer.  It was so tiny.    I also had the pork belly fried rice with fried egg on top.  I like the flavor of the pork belly and how tender it was.  Runny fried egg made it all better.  This place is good, but pricey since on the strip.  Ambiance was good too.  You need to make a reservation to get strip view seating.",

Highly recommend the crispy Brussel sprouts, popcorn shrimp tempura, filet mignon wrapped asparagus, crunchy tuna and the spicy scallops.  For dessert do order the green tea tiramisu.  Drinks : We just did beer and wine and they have a good selection.  All in all a wonderful dining experience.

    "text": "This review was for the evening Friday 9/6/19 for a party of 8 for a Bachelor Party.  **Service**  We had a reservation and was quickly seated.  Our server Pam was very helpful with suggesting that we order 3 pairs of the menu samplers (higher priced option) instead of 4 pairs that turned out to be just the right amount of food for everyone.  This was a much better option than trying to order a la carte for the size of our group.  She was also helpful in suggesting some sake bottle choices for the group.  The servers in general were good about switching out plates and keeping our glasses full of sake, beer, water and sparking water.  The pace of how fast the food came out was nice.  **Food**  Overall for the value, quality and volume of food was pretty solid and no one left hungry.  They even spiffed up a dessert plate with congratulations for our bachelor.  Brussels Sprout Chips - Very tasty and crispy and properly salted just right  Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice - Nice and spicy and crispy  Hamachi Carpacio - Tasty but hamachi was at room temp on plate that took away from experience  Kumquat Fluke - Tasty but again at room temp on plate that took away from experience  Ribeye w Japanese Potatoes - Japanese potatoes paired well with the ribeye.  Japanese mayo always adds a more delicate flavor and texture than western mayo  Nigiri - Toro, Salmon and Hamachi were all nice cuts and very tasty  Baked Crab Roll - Tasted more rice than crab but decent.  The presentation was a bit plain  Tuna Jalapeno - Thinking that was what we had.  Nice spiciness to it  Hamachi Jalapeno? - Looked and tasted similar to Tuna Jalapeno but had hamachi on top instead  Assorted Ice Cream Mochi - Mango, Strawberry and Chocolate were nice  Chilled Sake - First one suggested had nice fruity background and went well with food.  Second one for unfiltered was a bit on the dry side and didn't pair well with the food and would have gone for thicker and sweeter unfiltered one to pair.  Sake glasses were not chilled and ended up chilling them in water glasses.   ***Value/Cost***  10 courses plus edamame and including dessert, 2 bottles of premium sake, 6 beers, several bottles of sparkling water came out to about $150/person including gratuity.  Everyone was stuffed by the time dessert came around.  **Lighting/Ambiance**  It was a bit on the dark side but we were able to use our phone lights to see the menu and the food.  The low lighting did accentuate the light fixtures above along with the view of the main strip we could see from our table and it give a bit more intimacy.  ***Seating/Table***  We had a combination of chairs and low back restaurant booth seating.  The chairs were great but the low back booth seating had no back support for anyone sitting in them.  **Suggestions**  More attention to detail in general such as the following:  * Chilling the serving plate for the Hamachi and Fluke.  Since they are such thin slices, you have the heat transfer from the room temp serving plate that brings the fish up to room temp.  Had the plate been chilled with would have significantly heightened the delicate nature of both those dished.  *Serving chilled sake in chilled sake glasses would have done the same for the heightening the enjoyment of chilled sake.  *Serving the Ice Cream Mochi on chilled plates would have also help for the same reason and kept the Ice Cream from melting too fast.  ***Overall**  Have a very pleasant experience with the food, alcohol, service and ambiance and a very reasonable price for size of our party from beginning to end. I would visit again to try out other menu items.",

We loved how the sushi rolls where served anything with a sauce or topping was added at the table which is nice for presentation but also prevents the sushi rolls from getting soggy or falling apart. They offer spicy miso soup and that was some of the best miso my husband or I ever tried! I enjoyed coming here the space is beautiful and the view is nice if you sit near the windows. It's a great place to come for either happy hour or on a date night.",

    "text": "My husband and I had dinner here tonight at 8pm with reservations we made via opentable. The hostess seated us next to the window for a view of the strip as we requested, however we were realllly squeezed in with some other diners so after we were seated we got up to ask if we could sit somewhere else.  Along our way to the host stand, a server asked us if we were okay and we explained our situation. He said he would take care of us and motioned to an entire section of seats with a view of the Strip/Flamingo that was completely empty and said he'd get us some waters.   His name was Luis M and I'll be honest. He was very nice and I'm sure we threw him off a bit by moving and maybe messing up the hostess' flow but we ended up sitting for a good 5 minutes without menus. In this time we did get our waters from a food runner.   A woman (she's in my photos) who appeared to be a manager also came over as soon as we were seated to ask us where we had been sitting. Like why can't you just ask the hostess instead of us? We immediately felt shamed like we messed things up even though this restaurant was hardly busy.   5 minutes of sitting we waved her down and asked for menus. She quickly brought them over.   Luis came over and made some cocktail recommendations and let us look over the menu. Quite a bit of time passed and he comes back and apologizes. No problem, we've both been servers for many years in our younger days and totally get it. Things happen and you get busy.   We ordered a sea bass skewer and the short rib bao buns for our appetizers. A katana roll and spicy scallop roll for my entree with a matcha mule. My husband got the katana roll and a tuna roll for his entree.   So maybe 5 minutes later a food runner brings out a nigiri tuna. Confused, my husband and I have a short back and forth with Luis and the food runner. We expressed that we wanted a roll and they just looked dumbfounded. You would think they'd immediately take back the nigiri and bring out a tuna roll but they didn't offer so my husband, bless his heart, just says he'll eat it.   Now I'm just so irritated by how the night has gone. This manager comes over to bring our drinks and I ask her \"if someone orders a tuna roll, would they get this?\" And she explains no, it's nigiri.   So I tell her I'm honestly a little annoyed because we ordered that for my husband but he didn't get that. It's pretty awkward but my husband had already eaten one piece and we're basically just like, we've said our peace but we wanted you to know because we're not getting anything from her. No offer to get the right item out, nothing. Nada. No apologies either but just an uncomfortable smile and she leaves.   She walks away and now we're both just in crappy moods. We're locals and we are at the Forum Shops ALL the damn time and have never had such poor customer service.   Then they bring out my katana roll. A minute later they bring my husbands out and my spicy scallop roll. Lastly the bao buns.   The timing of the meal was just off. Entrees came out before appetizers. I'm just blown away at how poorly this evening went.   Luis was a very nice guy albeit he seemed overwhelmed at one point but what upsets me most is if a customer says they ordered A bit receive B, it is your job to fix it and get what they ordered.   We walked away utterly baffled at how poorly this meal went. We checked in at approx 8 and left 45 minutes later not even wanting dessert after this shit show.   Luis was nice enough to ask us what we were up to after we asked for a to go box (idk why we got a box, it'll just be leftovers we won't eat) and we said we were just going to go home and sleep. He informed us about the locals discount and a pretty awesome happy hour. It's too bad we're never coming back here again. There's just too many awesome spots for sushi in Vegas and we don't have time for mediocrity.   I still don't understand why everyone looked so confused when I expressed dissatisfaction at the roll vs nigiri mix up. It would have been fine if they just took it back and made what we originally ordered. And why even order appetizers if they come out at the same time or after our entree orders of sushi? I just find the deer in the headlights reaction to everything to be unacceptable.   Food was okay. Bao buns weren't good, rolls were okay but nothing I'd pay $24 for again. Cocktails were probably the best part of the meal. I really liked my matcha mule.",

They happily seated us and had a killer view of Caesar's front area near the window.  Service was attentive and so on the ball and food matched it perfectly. From the Ramen to the sushi to the Yakitori everything was exceptional. Surprised I never heard of this place before, prices were reasonable being in this fancy schmancy casino of Caesar's Palace.  Definitely will come back to this place, they had a nice menu with lot of options to choose from.",

It's definitely better to have one and not need one than to not have one and not be able to get seated!  We've been here once before, a few years ago, and I'd say the service is pretty consistent. The menu is on the pricier side for sushi, BUT you're getting top quality cuts of fish.  My boyfriend ordered rolls off the menu, and I ordered the matsu (8 pc chef choice sushi). I would order that 10/10 times from this restaurant. The toro, the uni, and even the yellowtail just melt in your mouth. The flavors were amazing. I can't even begin to describe them.  If you're debating eating here, just do it!",

They must have carried it with private jet or something.   I ordered variety of dishes from sashimi to special rolls. You've got to try these. Let the waiters/waitress guide you through the menu. Mine did and it was super success.   I sat at the bar and ordered several rolls. They made it one after another in a very timely manner. I walked in without a reservation around Friday 1PM. No reservation needed really around this time. I do think their dinner time would be super pack though so definitely reserve.   If you're into sushi, rolls, sashimi then you must try this place. I'm literally drooling as I'm writing this review.",

We weren't really next to the window, but we had a decent view. Anyways, our waitress was really kind and attentive. We were a group of 6, but she was nice to split the bill 3 ways. Most of us in the party ordered to share because looking at the price for these sushi was not worth it. Hubby and I ended up ordering 2 rolls and a ramen to share.   The two rolls came out and we are just staring at it like.. \"this is worth $14?\" It was really mediocre and the taste wasn't even all that. We could honestly get better sushi back home for a more decent price and the size portion would have been worth it.  The ramen came out after and I have to say it was pretty good. The broth was delicious and the sliced pork was melt in your mouth! That was the only good thing that came from our dinner.   Let's just say, we are not coming back. We'll find other sushi places in Vegas whenever we come back for a trip.",

Instead, we ordered a bottle of sake and Hendricks cocktails (gin, lime juice, simple syrup, cucumber).  These are the appetizers that we loved and would order again:  shishito peppers, green beans, spicy tuna rolls, shrimp & jalapeno rolls.  The fillet with asparagus, albacore rolls, popcorn/tempura shrimp were just okay and not worth reordering.  My hands down favorite were the shishito peppers!  Service was impeccable!  I can't remember our server but we were there awhile and had 2 different servers and both were excellent!",

On Fridays, their happy hour ends earlier than the rest of the week. Monday through Thursday, it goes until 7pm. On Friday, it ends at 6pm.  Since we missed the happy hour by a few minutes, we still decided to grab a bite at the bar. The mushroom tempura is, by far, the best item on the menu. Light batter, fried crispy, and tossed in truffle aioli makes for the perfect snack. The miso black cod is also very delicious. The fish flakes into beautiful slivers. The octopus carpaccio is not as tender as I would hope. It pales in comparison to the first two dishes.  Now I need to sneak away at a decent time to attend their happy hour.",

They are always happy to also customize a sushi roll to your taste or make you something not listed on the menu. Will be back again soon for sure. Make sure you try the pineapple brown sugar cocktail...so delicious!

There is no time to gamble, catch a show, or hang out in front of the Bellagio.   This is the BEST sushi i have ever had in my entire life.  (Trust me- I am old and I have lived in Japan.) I suggest you bring zip locks to line your coat so that you can bring home  black truffle tempura hand rolls in your purse. I don't know how food safe that would be but  it makes me smile just thinking about! We had a fabulous meal with an incredible view and just being there in a beautifully designed place.    Very nice attention to detail. I looked through the review remarks about the price and I will say this- again, I am old- you get what you pay for and the food here is worth paying for!",

Food: Sashimi - VERY fresh, this is probably the best thing on the menu. We ordered Salmon, Tuna, Yellowtail, etc. all very good.  Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus - this was a nice treat, beef was tender, and well marinated.  Kobe Potstickers - nothing special, save your money. Don't get it.  All of their rolls were nothing special.  Chilean Seabass - This was very very good. I highly recommend this.  Overall the FOOD is good, just the service wasn't the best.

    "text": "Stumbled on this place while on a shopping excursion at The Forum Shoppes.  The timing couldn't have been better since we arrived during the afternoon happy hour.  Nothing we ordered from the happy hour menu was over $6, including - Stella Artois - Blue Moon - Spicy Tuna Roll - Rock Shrimp w/ Ja Roll - Shrimp Tempura Roll - Whitefish Tempura Roll - Eggplant Tempura Roll - Albacore Tuna Roll - Filet Wrapped Asparagus - Crispy Chicken - Chocolate Volcano Cake  The sushi was fresh and the tempura was crispy.  The True testament to this place is that my wife, who does NOT each sushi, actually enjoyed most of the sushi!  We both thought the Eggplant Tempura Roll was inventive and as good as any of the traditional rolls.  You'd be wise to skip the Crispy Chicken completely as it was tasteless and dry.  The Chocolate Volcano Cake was...amazing and I could drink the vanilla bean sauce that came with it with a straw!  Keep in mind, this is basically a happy hour review, so there are probably much cooler and fancier offerings on Sushi Roku's full menu.  Lastly, a shout out to James our great bar tender!",

Las  Vegas restaurants need to take notes on this type of service; as we will be back to try the menu again and hopefully get the same gentleman who service us last night!!!!!!

Would we go back?  Probably not.  I would recommend getting a window seat, especially in the evening, when the lights are up.  Service was mixed; the greeter / host was really nice and engaged, but our waiter was somewhat absent.  It seemed he was covering a lot of the floor himself, but still.  The sushi itself was very well presented.  We got the chef's selection, which had some intriguing and tasty combinations - I'd recommend going that way.  Oh yeah - the Wagyu pot stickers are almost worth another star by themselves.  So -- not a place to avoid, or one to seek out particularly.",

The cocktail menu is also fantastic and they do some pretty awesome and original drinks. Definitely worth trying a couple different ones. I always like to see restaurants with a mezcal cocktail. Overall, there is better sushi out there but Sushi Roku offers an interesting experience with some extras on the menu to make up for it.

    "text": "Day 2 of my four day getaway in Vegas.  I try to eat at a good sushi restaurant wherever I visit and Sushi Roku was well rated everywhere.  I was not disappointed in my expectations.  I asked for a seat with a view of the strip and was obliged with a great view looking south down Las Vegas Blvd.    I ordered the chef's tasting menu, a sake sampler, and a cocktail suggested by the waiter (muddled tangerine and cucumber with gin - Yummy!).  Each course in the tasting menu was brought out by one of the chef's and I was given an explanation of the food and its preparation.    The appetizer course was amazing.  After two weeks it is hard to remember which each item was but I think the first item was a squid sashimi with olive oil and lemon.  The second item was a tuna tartar and the third item was a salmon sashimi.  Every item was sublime.  Course two was the hot appetizer.  This was a shrimp skewer with a mango salsa and a skewer with bacon wrapped cherry tomatoes.  Course three was a sashimi sampler with three types of tuna.  Beautiful presentation here.  Course four was perfectly seared scallop.  Course five was a sushi sampler with three pieces of tuna poke hand roll and 4 nigiri.  The salmon nigiri was the best salmon sushi I have ever tasted.  Course six was desert, a tiramisu with green tea infused lady fingers.  Heavenly.  Top rating in my book for service, view, ambiance, and most of all, the amazing food.",

The place was very quiet and after the lunch rush time. 2.30 - the serving size was not worth the price - after I was finished, I was still hungry but there was no one around to get a menu off.

    "text": "2012 Fall Restaurant Week Lunch #1. I'm going to try pump these reviews out fast. Just in case people had a hard time choosing where to go... like me!  My friend and I wanted to find a sushi place who offered a lunch course for Restaurant Week. We both never dined at Sushi Roku previously. It's located on the Strip side, 3rd floor of the Forum Shops. For Restaurant Week, they're offering a 3-course lunch for $30.12. We ordered each option. I've posted pictures of all our food.  For lunch:  1st Course: Choice of: Spicy Tuna Hanabi (crispy rice cake) OR  Seaweed Salad (cucumber sunomono, plum vinaigrette)  2nd Course:  Choice of: Sushi (tuna, yellowtail, salmon, albacore, whitefish, spicy tuna roll, miso soup) OR Grilled Petite Filet (homemade teriyaki sauce, steamed rice or mashed potatoes, miso soup)  3rd Course: Choice of: Mini Chocolate Cake OR Fresh Fruit & Sorbet   The appetizers were nothing spectacular, not even spicy. The sushi fish and miso soup did taste fresh. They didn't ask us how we wanted our filet cooked, it came to us medium-well. My friend didn't mind it, but I'm more of a medium-rare steak lover. Not only was I confused that a sushi place was serving mashed potatoes, they were pretty dry and ordinary. Spicy tuna roll was pretty standard.   The chocolate cake was good, a bit too rich and dense for me.   The tastiest thing was the mango sorbet. I'm not a big sorbet person, but this one was truly delicious. It wasn't mango-flavored. You could actually feel the strands of real mango in the sorbet. Best I've ever had.   The presentation was great. The service was on point, from the hostess, bussers, our server, and the sushi chefs who greeted us hello and farewell.  I had a good time, it was one of those lunches where nothing went wrong, yet your tummy wasn't doing the happy dance when you left. The service and presentation, (and of course the sorbet!) made this 3-stars for me. I wonder if I would've had a better experience if I had come to order off the regular menu. Other than it being an opportunity to donate to charity, if Restaurant Week is a chance for establishments to show what they can offer, Sushi Roku didn't impress me that much...",

We also got the tempura crab roll (good, not amazing) and something with unagi and avocado (may have been a dragon roll?).  We only had a few rolls and then were pretty hungry later that night, so next time we'd order more.  But we were in a hurry to catch our flight later and couldn't spend a lot of time.  The service was great..I don't remember our server's name, but she was great.  We also chatted with the sushi chef as he was making his creations.  It was pretty expensive, especially because we didn't fill up on the food.  I think for what seemed like 3-4 rolls plus 2 sakes it was like $85!  Kind of crazy.  But it was good quality and good service...so I thought it was worth it this time.  Or maybe I was just feeling rich. ;)  We would go back just to see what else they have on the menu and to spend a little longer relaxing with our meals.  It's so hard to decide where to go in Vegas because there are SO many options - but I'd say this is a nice spot for a date and a pretty good experience overall.",

    "text": "My fiance and I came to Sushi Roku while on a trip to Vegas. It was our first stop on our 3 day trip and we had a great time. The truffle oil edamame had good flavor and was different than what we typically order. Our waiter recommended the Yellowtail diced chilis appetizer and I thought it was perfect! My fiance did not care for it but he enjoyed the sushi. I felt the sushi was average. Our waiter was very helpful and professional. We also requested for a window seat to look out over the strip which they accommodated. We had a great time and will be returning on our next trip!",

    "text": "We came for lunch and it was alright. There was no one at the front counter when we walked up and we stood there for about a minute or two looking like a couple of lost souls because we were unsure of the following: 1) Are they open? It looks empty. But there's a waiter walking around and there's sushi chefs behind the sushi bar. 2) Should we just walk in? But I don't know where to go... the sushi bar looks open but I can't tell if we're allowed to seat ourselves.  (Even the waiter who was walking around the sushi bar area, who obviously saw us looking confused didn't greet us...)  We walked in, got maybe ten feet inside before the waiter finally said, \"oh she'll (referring to the missing hostess I assumed) be back... she went somewhere....\" We said okayyy and went back outside to the front, where we waited a few more minutes.  My bf got the bento box with teriyaki chicken and spicy tuna roll while I ordered a vegetable tempura donburi and a shrimp and asparagus roll. There was something strange about the roll I ordered, though, but I couldn't place it... I think it might've been the fact that it had some kind of white sauce that may or may not have been mayo (thankfully, I didn't get sick after lunch that day or the next for that matter!)... the teriyaki chicken was excellent - prob the best I've ever had! The chicken was cooked perfectly - moist,  succulent and flavorful!  And the spicy tuna was also pretty awesome - way better than the roll I chose.",

And, I had had enough.  I became gravely ill.  I was homesick.  But, before I could ride that wave.  I had to make one quick pit stop at a sushi joint.    It was difficult finding a sushi place from Bally's casino.  But, finally I found Sushi Roku!  It was delicious!  I ordered 3 items.  The entrees and appetizers were all divine!  The hostess asked where I wanted to sit.  I shyly smiled and scanned the room.  Just as I was about to sit at a table.  To the corner of my eye I seen him.  Thats when I decided to sit at the sushi bar.  By george, the sushi chef was so handsome.  And, to top it off he made Amazing sushi.  Not to mention this place has a great ambience.  Nice music!  And, cheerful employees.  Its definitely sexy!  A+, yay.",

The atmosphere of the restaurant is dark  but sexy and has a great view of the strip (so ask for a window seat).  My girlfriend had the spicy tuna roll which was good.    The app menu is long so don't get confused like I did, but I was impressed with  popcorn shrimp, so no telling how large the other apps unless I hear it from you yelpers.

Being in the city of everything excessive I expected more but actually the portions were much smaller and not as good as I've had at the other location in Newport. The beef skewers and sea bass skewers were smaller and the Salmon carpaccio was skimped on the truffles. The picture I have shows Newport Fashion Island with the larger and cleaner cuts of truffles and Vegas has 2 nice cuts with a few shavings instead. The other difference was with the White Lotus roll, it didn't taste the same and the presentation was different because it did not have the crispy onions on top. I was expecting the same experience but so it was a little disappointing.",

So happy that we went with the omekase even though it was pricey. We think it was totally worth it.   The ambience of the restaurant is classy and they have a great view of the strip.

    "text": "You know how they say not to order fish in a steakhouse? Reverse that statement completely at Sushi Roku- despite being named for their traditional fish dishes, they do a damn good job with meats. Order a steak or at least try a meaty app if you visit, you won't be sorry.   GET IT: Tuna Tartare Phyllo Cups with yuzu guac and soy truffle- beautiful and delicious! Brussels Sprout Chips with truffle oil- crispy and addictive. Mushroom Tempura with Creamy Miso- so savory, great sauce. Hanabi- spicy tuna on crispy rice. But only if you've never had it. I'm a fan. Salmon Sashimi Carpaccio- this was the better sashimi app we tried. Diablo Salmon- a daily special roll, served with an incredible honey soy sauce. Wagyu Sliders- thick and meaty, get more than one because you won't want to share Grilled Lamb Chops with Chimmichurri Sauce- two piece app, super juicy! Prime Rib Eye Steak \"Japonais\" or Filet Mignon- you can't go wrong with either of these large orders of tender, flavorful meat, sided with garlic green beans and potatoes.  DIY S'Mores OR Chocolate Lava Cake- I mean, if you have to do dessert, you can either go with a something fun or something reliably good. Don't expect both.  SKIP IT: Yellowtail diced chilies- It's the same dish you can find anywhere else. Seared Salmon Sashimi- the fresh was better Roasted Cauliflower- a fail.  Katana and Shima Rolls- pretty basic, actually. Assorted Mochi, Bananas Foster, Pumpkin Spice Bread Pudding- one was unremarkable, one was a little weird, and one was served cold.  Presentation of all dishes was stellar but the service wasn't as attentive as the location and price point led me to expect. Being that it's in Ceasars and specializing in seafood, be prepared to shell out (pun intended!) for your meal. They've got a solid HH available daily from 4PM til 6 or 7, depending on the day.",

The sushi seemed rushed oh a rather empty night- I was in not in. hurry as I told them but maybe they just wanted me out of there.   If they sit in the back you have very good views of the strip but if you are toward the front it kind of looks like it are sitting in a mall restaurant- and a rather low rent one at that.   I went there because the reviews were very good and there was no line and the menu looks pretty solid. Unfortunately, I will not be back.",

    "text": "Sushi Roku is kind of hidden since its on the third floor of the Forum Shops. Few people have told me that this place was pretty good, so I knew it existed. However, we never actually dined here until recently. Came here on a Saturday night, but the restaurant was empty. There were a few people sitting at the sushi bar and maybe 3 other tables that were occupied.   We started off with three of their Signature Rolls - the Crunchy Spicy Tuna, Crab Dynamite and the Baked Lobster. My husband and I liked the Baked Lobster one the best. They put a creamy Miso sauce on top of the roll which was good, but if it had a stronger Miso flavor, it would have been perfect! There was nothing special about the other two that we ordered. They were basically your standard Spicy Tuna and California Rolls that can be found at any sushi restaurant. We also ordered the Popcorn Shrimp Tempura. Kind of hard to screw up Shrimp Tempura, but it was tasty with the sauce. My only complaint is that maybe they should consider having the spicy creamy sauce on the side because after a while, the shrimp seemed sort of soggy.    Service was excellent. Our server was friendly and checked on us often. Our drinks were always being refilled and empty plates were taken away quickly.   I'm glad I tried Sushi Roku, but there was nothing special about this place that makes me want to come back. I think they need more selections for their signature rolls. I'm a snob when it comes to sushi, so I already have my favorite sushi spot! But for a $100 bill for 2 people, there are definitely better places to eat sushi.",

While the decor is a very chic contemporary japanese and quite pleasing, there are huge windows all around that turn this place into a sauna - even in January, when the outside temp is 60, it was borderline unpleasant while dining - can't imagine how it feels when the sun is really on.  Onto the food: I ordered 3 things from the menu - I sent 2 of them back - when I received my last 2 plates the fish inside was cooked, and this wasn't the description on the menu.  The only reason I didn't send all 3 back was because the first item I got, Hamachi sashimi - was \"ok\" taste wise, and since it was the first dish - I was hoping things would get better from there.  Yes - when I goto a sushi place, I expect raw fish.  Anyhow - the server didn't blink when I told him of my displeasure with the dishes, and the check was settled without any obvious display of annoyance.  I will say that this was a far cry from my experiences at Sushi Roku in LA, which were delicious.",

From what I gather, everything else that was ordered was good:  the halibut fish special, the ramen, the chicken skewers, and the sushi were delightful.

However, the one place I finally went to was Samba Sushi and what a great surprise.  I tend to avoid sushi in several places when traveling unless in Hawaii and some parts of CA and Japan.  Sushi Samba had some of the best dishes I have had and the quality was great.  They have a variety of menu items with small plates and full entrees.  They do some traditional sushi but mostly more interesting variations as well as the S American dishes.  Some of the items were: Rock fish Wagyu Gyoza Rock shrimp tempura Green bean tempura Pork belly Moqueca Mista. Seafood coconut milk and rice with green onion Yamato sushi roll(maguro, Fois gras, Osetra caviar) Uni shushi outstanding  Great sake list  All the fish and shellfish were fresh and well prepared.  It gets busy so we ate at the bar and the service was excellent there.  Luna and Maria can help with picking some great dishes at the bar.  It is on the higher price side but worth it compared to a lot of other places where the food doesn't always live up to the expectations in Vegas.  Looking forward to next trip back there.",

We were having a very enjoyable night and were quite starving by the time we wandered into Roku. So we had a very good time, but with that caliber of company the restaurant was the last thing I was paying attention to. Also, that meal was very early in my sushi-eating career. Since then, I've been looking to go back.  Enter: 20% discount for locals. That's all it took to get me through the door for my 2nd run at Sushi Roku. This time, accompanied by Ramze S, and Mr & Mrs Mark G - all accomplished sushi enthusiasts, with Mark being something of a gourmet. Let me give it to you breakdown-style.  FOOD: The food was pretty good. Plenty of pretty good. and not enough great, especially with the prices in mind. The sushi & sashimi was pretty good quality, but nothing outstanding about it - and that was the consensus from the table. Where they seemed to do better was with the prepared dishes, which on our table was mostly appetizers.   SERVICE: Acceptable at best. Yes, it was early in the evening and the place was just getting rolling. But on the other hand, it was nearly empty, so why not go over the top, Mr. Waiter? They didn't really foul anything up, but it wasn't the quickest service ever, and not only was friendliness or charm out of the question, but so was knowledge! The question \"Can I get fresh wasabi?\" took a 5 minute trip to the back before a \"No, sorry.\" could be returned. (And, for what it's worth, this is the first sushi restaurant Mark's ever been to that didn't have fresh wasabi)  ENVIRONMENT: It's a pretty nice place, that's for sure. And not uncomfortable. But it definitely doesn't look so hot while there's still light pouring through the giant glass windows, so come post-nightfall.   OVERALL: \"Meh\" is right. We had a good enough meal, and a good enough time, but that's not enough these days, especially not at the prices that Sushi Roku charges. Even considering the 20% off, there was nothing special enough about the place to make it worth a return trip. We didn't feel taken or anything like that, but it takes more than not feeling robbed to get 3+ stars.   Take some decent quality sushi, add all the pitfalls of a chain restaurant, mark the price up 100% and put it in the hippest room you can find. BAM! Instant Sushi Roku. If you wanna spend big bucks on sushi, even on the strip, you can find better places to do it.",

I started with a Lychee Mojoito (tasty) and miso soup (average to good).  My world officially became rocked when the Hanabi: Spicy Tuna over a Crispy Rice Cake came to the table.  I'm sure if I saw a video of my reaction, I would be completely embarrassed but I can honestly say it was one of the best hot appetizers I have ever had. My poor waitress had to put up with me through all this.  I'm so sorry.  We ordered two rolls, Shima roll: spicy tuna & avo w/shrimp, cilantro & wrapped with soypaper; and the Baked Lobster Roll: Lobster & asparagus on the inside and a baked yellow sauce consisting of sweet miso & egg.  I was in sushi heaven.  Great service, awesome atmosphere, pretty good chill music for the environment.  All this with a beer and another mixed drink, approx $150.    You can not stop me from going back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

If you don't each much sushi or sashimi then perhaps you will have your expectations exceeded.  I will not go there again.  Green Tea ice cream for $10, Sake sampler was $20.  Neither of them were any different than you will find anywhere else.",

    "text": "Sushi Roku, good reputation in LA. Sushi Roku in Las Vegas should be called Sushi Fooku, because that's what they're going to do to your wallet and your palate.  A group of 5 of us came here around 9:30PM on Saturday night, in need of pre-late night nourishment. Yelping before leaping, this place had a decent review on Yelp. This is one of the only times I have  been steered wrong...but it was oh so wrong.  The problems started when we began to select rolls to order. Usually I'm a sashimi girl, and I shy away from rolls. But I knew I wanted something to fill us all up. So I started everyone off with the Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice, and the first roll Spicy Canadian Rock Shrimp with Asparagus. The Tuna w/ Crispy Rice was great, but this is a standard for any sushi restaurant. The roll, on the other hand, was so tiny, 6 small pieces with even smaller ingredients - 11 dollars down.  I asked our waiter what he suggested in terms of rolls, and wouldn't you know it, the rolls he told us about were both the MOST expensive rolls on the menu, 26 dollars a piece. A-hole.  We ordered three more rolls, all small and average tasting and then were told that the kitchen was closing - WTF, 11, this is Vegas? But whatever, that's fine, we're done anyway. One round of drinks for 4 people, 2 edamames and four of the CHEAPEST rolls was $150 dollars. I'd happily shell out twice this if I didn't think I was merely paying for the overhead of the restaurant, because I know the food didn't cost 1/4 of that.  If you do go here, don't expect anything great from the rolls.  It's an expensive tourist joint, plain and simple. The worst part is that it's now highly unlikely I go to this place in Los Angeles. I was so sad to have this experience because of Roku's great name out in LA, but I have to say, this location is the King of Meh.",

Its Vegas, so its going to be expensive on the strip let alone its in the forum shops at Ceasers. Anyhow, the sushi grade was great and most of the rolls were really good. The Katana roll was amazing. I ordered a side of the sweet potato tempura and i got two slice for 6 bucks. Had i known that, i probably wouldn't had ordered it. Anyways, it was good, but i would rather had eaten somewhere else for that amount of money.",

So imagine when to my surprise I still managed to be the first one there with ample time to sit at the small bar and enjoy the company of the friendly bartender and review their nice selection of wine.  Only out of California for 24 hours, I still missed it enough to settle on a crisp Russian River Sauvignon Blanc.    By its name, you know that Sushi Roku is Japanese fare with a lot of Sushi options.  If you know me, you know Japanese food falls behind Korean BBQ and anything with \"Steakhouse\" in the title as my least favorite dine out experience.  Nonetheless, I persevered for my sister's birthday weekend wishes, as I did much that weekend.  I was nonplussed to see that they had a seaweed salad that I managed to combine with a few other small items for one full meal.  I did not enjoy how both my miso and salad which ended up being my largest course were both served before anyone else received an appetizer.  Perhaps the gentleman servers were overwhelmed by the prettiness of the nine ladies while I was appreciating the artistic bathroom doors.",

They bring their own flair to standard items. They also have managed to create some very tasty and interesting dishes of their own. The hanabi is very tasty as is the tuna tartare. The salmon skin hand roll ordered a little extra crispy is the best I've ever had - the taste of the salmon skin though delicate, is not oily or overwhelmed by the other ingredients in the roll. Suggestion for all diners - try the sushi before you bathe it in soy and wasabi. You don't want to mask any of the flavors. Only real downsides - 1 it's on the strip so getting to and from can be difficult, and 2 it's expensive (but sometimes, you do get what you pay for).",

So this was either going to be really good, or really crappy!  Apologies ahead of time for the lack of details, as it was on a girls weekend to Vegas that I dined here, and as with any Vegas trip - details are a bit blurry!!!

That was nice. This was a very pleasant experience and if I am ever at Caesars again, I will come back.",

The spicy tuna had a strange, mushy texture-I was not a fan. We also ordered the shrimp tempura roll which was great. I may have been expecting too much; I was not impressed with this lunch. With two cocktails and tip it was over $80!! Ouch! I do not think I will return-there is better sushi out there for less money. Only go here if you want to over spend on sub-par sushi. The view was nice!!",

The wait staff were rude, unattentive and just gave off a general bad vibe.  And since we were a party of 8, they slapped on an 18% service charge.  Again, that would've been acceptable if we received ANY SERVICE at all.  Views were great but how can you enjoy it when you spent the evening trying to flag down your waiter?  I ended up having to get up to get someone to get me more tea.  I felt sorry for the booth next to ours because the waiter served my tea climbing OVER their seat.  Maybe he was too tired to walk the extra 3 feet around to fill my tea cup?  Given the level of competition on the Strip, one would think service would be stellar but I've had better service at any strip mall sushi diner.    Truly awful, stay away.",

    "text": "\"Jane, you ignorant slut...\" - Dan Aykroyd    (That's basically what I'm thinking as I read some of these sushi bar reviews.  I mean, who the heck rates a sushi bar based on the distance of the walk to the restaurant or the taste of the 'prime rib' they order there?)  First of all, I think this is about a 3 1/2-Star.  Let me explain why but before I do... I want you, dear reader, to think about an important question:  \"What is the criteria for good sushi?\"  I believe there are some very basic criteria: -- FRESHNESS How soft is the fish?  Does it smell?  Is there a slimy texture to it?  Does it melt in your mouth?  And doesn't this depend a lot on when fresh fish arrives?  DUH.  Ladies & gentlemen, I think we just solved the question of \"why are the reviews all over the place for Sushi Roku?\"   -- CHEF SKILL (Selection, cut, preparation) What portion of the fish is served to you? And how that portion sliced?  Is it prepared with something in addition to rice, like a plum sauce?  How is the formula for this restaurant's sushi rice?  These are all things that should be considered in looking at sushi because they can all drastically affect the overall meal. -- PRESENTATION Does the dish appear appetizing?  What kind of wasabi & nori is used?  Is special sashimi shoyu provided with sashimi dishes?  Sushi that looks unappetizing is just plain poorly made sushi.  A significant part of the experience of dining isn't just eating but the anticipation of eating as well.  The fact is that Sushi Roku's sushi is just \"okay\".  On the days they get their shipment of fish delivered, the quality is very good.  Other days, not so much.  Their chefs aren't bad but like most touristy places in Vegas, you don't form a relationship with the chef.  At best, you get to know the restaurant manager.   What compensates for some of the variation is the fact that Sushi Roku, despite its upper crust placement, is about 20% CHEAPER than the other big name sushi restaurants. (i.e. Nobu)  This difference in cost will be important later when I go over group visits.  The sushi starts them 3-Stars.  What gets them a little more over 3-Stars however are the other things. -- FOOD/DISHES They have a fair number of \"group oriented\" dishes both incorporating raw fish or those that are cooked, allowing dinners to be eaten & shared by people who both \"eat sushi\" & \"don't eat raw fish\".  (Here's the menu:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sushiroku.com%2Fsushiroku%2Fmenus%2Flv.asp&s=959c0b944ce329fc3398a6b32cfb9fda3e5fd282d05cef29f981ff2bfd7f87f6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sushiroku.com/sushiroku/...</a>) Additionally, the atmosphere is a lot more \"relaxed\" with the pretension & arrogance turned down a few notches, compared to some other sushi joints.    This makes Roku surprisingly \"party friendly\" for folks doing group get-togethers or Bachelorette Parties, etc. since with the well-balanced menu, everyone can order something cheaply that they'd be willing to eat, & then pass it around w/out getting too dressed up.  You don't comfortably get this in many restaurants in Las Vegas, even Nobu.   -- SERVICE The wait staff is okay but what defines Sushi Roku however is Kenji Tamida - General Manager of Sushi Roku, Las Vegas.  Most of the time, you can find the well-dressed Kenji personally greeting & escorting guests like VIPs to their tables along with the hostess, shaking hands, & making people feel welcome.  Kenji has a knack for remembering people & providing that high quality, repeatable touch that is lacking in so many turn-and-burn Vegas restaurants today.  And if you've got a group , he'll even sit & have a drink with you if you ask him to & tell you about what's hot in the city, 'cause he's a high profile partier too.  Ask him, & he just might be able to point you to the quickest way to the party, if you know what I mean.  If you stop by, be sure to say hi to him by name & tell him you read about him on Yelp.  He'll take care of you. -- DECOR The decor is similar to what you'd see in Nobu, Yellowtail, etc.  What's nice is that the restaurant is configurable for groups of 4 all the way to 30+.  Additionally, their view is great:  It hangs directly over the Las Vegas Strip & give you a rare up-close 3 story view of everything going on while you're dining.   Be sure to make a reservation for a window seat.    BONUS:  For some reason, a lot of bachelorette parties come here.  I think it's because Roku's known for being a quieter, less dressy, lower profile place & thus I've seen as many as 3 parties going on at the same time, each with the signature wedding veil on the bride to be.  CONCLUSION: I want to stress that you're not going to go back to Roku over & over for the food.  While it's decent, it's stil a notch below places like Nobu & Yellowtail.  Ultimately, however it's an all-around good place for groups, birthday parties, bachelor parties, etc., w/ a good balance of raw & cooked dishes w/ something for everyone, personal attention from the management, an unbeatable view, & consistently less lower prices than other sushi houses.  3 1/2-Star",

Sat at the bar in order to get the happy hour menu, and had Donald (donnie?) as our server.  He was amazing, attentive, and gave some great suggestions.  We ordered a ton of appetizers (the brussell  sprouts and shrimp with miso sauce were a few favorites) and each ordered some rolls (the Jalapeno shrimp roll was great).  All the food was great, someone at the bar bought us a drink (some kind of infused vodka with champagne) and Donnie arranged to have a desert brought out for me to congratulate me on my upcoming wedding, complete with a gorgeous firework sparkler thing in a champagne glass! Will be recommending this place to everyone and will be coming back every time I come back to Vegas! Thanks for the great food, ambiance, and of course, the customer service.  Amazing!",

The view of The Strip from the main window is great, and the decor is competitive with the best of them.  Music is new agey/lounge, but I know a lot about this genre and it could be a lot better.  The food was fairly good taste-wise when compared to other sushi restaurants in its price range.  However, it is more than a little overpriced considering the portion size.  You are literally getting mere morsels for $35-40.  When the waiter brought me my \"main dish\" it was something that looked size-wise like leftovers from someone else's meal.  Our total bill was in the $350 range and absolutely nobody had enough food.  In terms of taste, two out of six dishes failed to impress, one was mediocre, and three were good (including mine).  Overall, probably would not recommend.",

After dropping our luggage off in our rooms, we promptly took to yelp to find some sushi for my poor landlocked friend. We ended up at Sushi Roku and had a pleasant lunch. We each ordered iced teas. The iced tea had some sort of fruit flavor that we couldn't place. It wasn't sweet, but you could taste something tropical.  I opted for the lunch special which included salmon teriyaki, salad, rice and sashimi. I also added a miso soup. My friend ordered a specialty roll and a seaweed salad. My expectations were actually kind of low (this place is inside a mall) and they were easily surpassed by this lunch. The miso soup was flavorful and served at an appropriate temperature. My friends salad was really delicious. It was made with the very dark green seaweed and not the weird neon kind. My salad was pretty generic and with the exception of fishing out and munching on the the bitter micro-greens, I basically left it untouched. My sashimi was ok. Nothing really special. It could've been a bit colder. My salmon teriyaki was very flavorful, but a tiny bit overcooked. The rice on the plate was plain steamed rice. It was exactly as expected. My friends roll looked pretty good, but towards the end, she just took it apart and ate the fish because the ratio of rice to other ingredients was too high.    Not a terrible lunch, but also not the best I've ever eaten. It was definitely OK.",

Long wait much?  The chicken were 4 pieces. Seriously?! Come on, dude. 4 pieces for $14? Don't cheap out on me. Ugh, I was still ravenous after my meal.  The miso and chicken pieces were good. But wished the portions were a tad bit more.  My girlfriend ordered the $14 ramen which was price-worthy.   Despite our longer than average wait, our group was charged 20% gratuity. We protested, they returned the money. Seriously lame.  Not a fan of this place. Will not return; there are better places to eat on the strip.",

Yes, it is expensive, but the fish is flown in daily and it is consistently the best tasting fish available.    Do yourself a favor and order the Shima Roll with spicy tuna, shrimp, cilantro and sriracha.  It is fantastic. Other Must-Try menu items are the garlic green beans, tuna carpaccio with garlic chips, the baked miso black cod, yellowtail sashimi with diced chilis, anything from their sushi/sashimi menu and their specials are always great. Whenever foie gras is on the specials menu, my partner always orders it because he can't get it in California and he always enjoys what he orders.    When you make your reservation, request a table by the window for a spectacular view of the strip. This makes an already romantic setting even more special.",

The Miso Soup is delish, the Tofu-yaki (tofu teppan yaki) was REEEEDICK!!  I get happy thinking about it. And the edamame has pieces of salted-crack sprinkled on them, I don't know what makes theirs soo flippin' good.  But it's pricey and we left a tad hungry.  The ambiance is quite pleasant and modern, the service both times was great!!  I'll go back and I'm happy to RE-review.   Local Discount 20% off",

So we had a pretty good waiter, we got the strip view table, and waters were regularly refilled.  Everyone at the table (party of 6) had very different meals - some had the special sushi assortment, one got the seabass (supposedly the best ever), one had tempura, my bf had salmon and scallop entree (he thought the salmon was dry), and I had the complicated order.  My boyfriend and I split the crudo roku appetizer (all 6 sashimi specials in mini format): halibut with chili paste, yellowtail with diced chile, tuna carpaccio with ponzu, albacore with crispy onions, salmon with fresh greens and truffle, and octopus with salsa.  Yum little flavor fest.  The menu had daily specials which had Japanese and Spanish mackerel, and the regular sushi menu had regular and Spanish mackerel.  They were out of all of it (the waiter said new owners are too lazy to swap out daily menus.  He also said previous owners made poor cocktails...thanks for the commentary) - instead I got whole scallop sushi (Hotate), softshell crab roll (very nice, not too fried, lots of yummy sprouts), a yellowtail scallion handroll (good quality fish, but not fresh nori), and miso eggplant appetizer (good sauce, yummy, hot).  Also, I had the ginger yuzu martini - very refreshing with the meal...yuzu juice, ginger vodka, and ginger-vanilla something.  Overall, it was very pricey but tasty and delicious.  For our birthday girl in the party, they brought out TWO desserts ON THE HOUSE: wonton wrapped ice cream with tropical fruits, and chocolate lava cake with ice cream and berries.  Those were polished off fast.  Then I told our waiter that my bf and I were locals and he gave us 20% off the entire 6-person check (we saved $60).  Don't think I would rush back because of sheer cost, but I would recommend the experience.",

My lunch consisted of:  Baked Lobster Rolls Scallop & Salmon Nigiri Spicy Scallop Hand roll Filet Foie Gras Skewer  First Impression, Fish pieces for the nigiri was relatively smaller than other a la carte places. Foie Gras Skewer, I was expecting a bit more for the price of $18. It was literally just 1 skewer. With super thin slices of Foie Gras between meat and asparagus.   For the taste, the salmon, I couldn't tell too much how fresh the fish was. It had a little bit of aftertaste, a bit fishier than normal, although did not have a freezer burn taste, so I can't tell. The scallop tasted fresh though.   Spicy Scallop Hand Roll, might be too spicy for some people, but I like my food SPICY. So I enjoyed the taste, but the texture was just too mushy.  The Foie Gras Skewer - biggest let down of my whole order. There was literally not any noticeable foie gras on this. I was expecting more. You can't even taste it. The beef filet was dry. Bleh.   The only thing I semi-enjoyed was the baked lobster rolls. Chunk of lobster in each bite. But even so, still mediocre at best. Sushi Roku didn't really do it for me. It definitely did not live to its hype. Overpriced, and mediocre.",

The kale salad is a must - the mushrooms and tangy dressing add texture and great flavor.    We had reservations but I don't think they're necessary unless visiting during peak Vegas visiting periods.",

We ordered the mixed tempura, three of the signature rolls and three of the sashimi choices.  With just one sashimi selection costing nearly $40 and signature rolls hovering at $30 each, it didn't take long to run up the tab.  The sushi rolls fell apart way too easily.  The rice didn't have the right texture and there's no excuse for that at these prices.  The service was also spotty.  Again, not cool at these prices.  The decor is fine, but I am sure this place benefits from candlelight.  It was a bit dark and spare in the afternoon for lunch.  It also smelled like fish.  A sushi place that is this spendy shouldn't smell like fish.  Frankly, I think you can get better sushi for the money in Vegas.",

    "text": "I really am giving this place 3.5 stars for two reasons.  The noise level and the lack of server loyalty to our table.  Atlhough that's not necessarily a bad thing, it was a bit confusing.  I'll get to that shortly.  We arrived just a few minutes after our reservation, but that's because we got dropped off by the cab on the wrong side and had to hike to the other side where the shops were to get to the restaurant.  When we arrived we were seated promptly.  We were placed in a nice two top right against the window overlooking The Strip.  Really nice view.  However, although were so close to each other, it seemed difficult to have a normal conversation.  The music was a little loud, which in turn had the patrons talking louder, and the two tops are so close together, we were having to talk over each other tables conversations.  I'm sure they felt the same way. This is where I get to the lack of server loyalty.  We had someone greet our table almost immediately.  He offered us menus and water and said a server would be over shortly.  He even put in an order of edamame for us.  Server #1.  Our edamame came out almost immediately, brought to us by what I assume was a runner.  Person #2.  The server came over to take our drink orders. Server #3.  This was also the same person that took our food order.  The previous runner brought out our first round of sushi.  The sushi was delicious.  We had a couple rolls and the Chef's Sushi sampler.  The tuna and salmon we had was like butter.  Definitely high quality. When we were finished with our first round, a server asked us if we wanted anything additional.  This was a different server from our initial one.  Server #4.  We said we weren't sure and asked for another menu.  Once we decided, we had Server #5 come take our final order.  He also brought us our last roll, and brought us our check.  When we got the check, I was confused as to who would be getting our tip due to the number of people that served us.  While I certainly appreciated the constant attention, I wanted to make sure that the tip was given appropriately.  I tipped 20% as I do normally and hopefully the servers receive their tips appropriately, however that may be.  Not once did we ever see Server #1 again. All in all, I would probably return here again.  Maybe not on my next visit, but at some point.",

So of course our party still showed up late to the restaurant still in thanks to said Hennessey. The staff still managed to be very friendly despite our lack of grace and composure (aka Bachelor Party).  In fact they locked us in the private room with an equally crazy Bachelor Party also from our hometown (Go Niners).  The food itself was good. I had the Crab Dynamite Roll, the Spicy Scallop roll and the Crispy Salmon dinner. None of the above stuck out specifically but the quality and presentation are enjoyable. Drinks blurred into Sake Bombs and shots of Patron. The check was a bit rough but I felt it matched my expectations well.  My overall star rating is 3.5",

But what really impress me about this joint is that the decor was very nice, but I hate it when I go to a restaurant where the food isn't up to par with the restaurant though.  I like the factor that they used real bamboo as their coverings in the window as tourists would walk by, and the atmosphere was very relaxed and somber like.    I wouldn't mind coming back here, but I just think that you could've found a better place compare to here.  Its just overrated.",

You may want to give yourself extra time though if you're seeing a show after dinner or are on a tight schedule.  This is a nice spot for sushi and more. There were some pretty unique dishes...a sea bass with black truffle oil for appetizer was really good. The sea bass was so tender and yummy. There was a caulifower with some very light breading that was very good too.  For sushi - the fish seemed really fresh and melted in your mouth. We didn't try the really unusual rolls though - they had some pricey ones.  What I remember was the dessert. The green tea mousse was light and airy topped with matcha powder. The apple fritter with dulce de leche ice cream was very good too. They have a chocolate souffle on the menu too but we were running late so we did not try it.  They also had a variety of sake and cocktails so there's something for everyone here whether you like sushi or not.",

We asked him why didn't he tell us and he said because he didn't want us thinking he was trying to sell us a bottle of water.  SOLD!!! we asked for a bottle of FIGI.

Maybe the fact that it was virtually deserted influenced my perception, but the interior was just too dark and gloomy, this despite the fact that our table had a picture window view of the Las Vegas strip in its full neon glory.  The hostess seated us at a table that was broken--the bench seat backs were gone and were \"being repaired.\"  There were at least two other similar tables on either side of us, so I dont know why she seated us there.  At first our server had a bit of an attitude, but she became very pleasant later on, so I forgive that.  Anyway, the sushi was okay, not spectacular.  I did enjoy the monk fish liver.  But the California roll was mealy.  Also, eel is suppose to be served warm, mine was cold and tasted refrigerated.  The tempura was kinda greasy, which is just unacceptable.  The Saki selections and mixed drinks were very good.    Overall, a ho-hum experience.  Maybe I'm spoiled by the sushi restaurants in San Francisco, but this place just isnt up to snuff.",

All of those aforementioned things caused people to hate him, no, loathe his very essence, so every time he got the ball, the opposing team would yell, \"Overrated!\"  Some people would say that Sushi Roku is overrated, but I say those people are jealous losers who are sad they can't eat here everyday.  This place is soooo good, and I will not comment on the price because I never saw the bill (thank you to my employer).  But I will tell you about the fanciful meal I experienced.  We started with the BEST DISH I had there: the lobster tempura in a miso soy glaze.  Lobster, check.  Fried, check.  Tempura, check.  Yummy sauce, check.  It's like a Chicken McNugget on steroids!    After that, I was afraid the other dishes wouldn't hold up, but they did.  Some sushi/rolls to try (I can't eat fish, only shellfish...don't judge me!): crab dynamite, hotate (so sweet, so buttery!), amaebi (yes, i like to eat the crunchy heads), and the baked crab.  P.S. Note on high school basketball star: he plays basketball for some other country because he didn't make it into the NBA, and there is a hilarious video on youtube with him trying to dunk and instead falling and banging his head on the ground.  He's okay so you're not going to hell if you laugh.",

    "text": "Here's a perfect example why I am hesitant about fine dining sometimes. You get great service, pretty looking food but it doesn't even taste good. So what are you coming for? The food itself or the service and food presentation?   If I had to describe the food here in one word, BLAND! A few more words, EXPENSIVE FOOD COURT FOOD.  And the walk here is such a PAIN IN THE @$$ from the front entrance of Caesars.  Ok, the place is very nice. The service is excellent. Food presentation is wonderful but that does not mean it tastes good.  The Calamari was way overcooked. I sent it back and the chef said that's how it is. It's supposed to be dry and rubbery? I should take the cook over to Cheesecake Factory and let him try to Calamari there. I couldn't even chew it. Spat it out and they were willing to take it off our tab. Thumbs up!  Prime rib was so so. I wanted to ask for some A1 sauce so you know the marinade wasn't flavorful enough.  Crunchy spicy tuna roll and lobster specialty rolls were absolutely bland. No one at my table tasted a single thing. Of course, there was no way they could mess up a regular tuna roll so that was fine.  Sea bass was probably the best dish and when I say the best, I'm being generous. It was still so so.  $6 extra for miso soup and rice to add to your entree? Ehh...  $160 including tip for 4 people. Never again. Social House @ TI is a bit more expensive but at least the food tastes MUCH better.",

We had a group of six eating here and everyone was excited about what they got. Everyone at the table had assorted rolls that they were incredibly happy with (especially the Dynamite Crab Roll). The spicy tuna was VERY spicy, which I love. We also shared the Katana Roll and the shrimp tempura roll, all very yummy. They did find out we were celebrating a birthday at the table and brought us complementary desserts to share. Really fun atmosphere -- only downgrade would be that the service was a bit slow.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place more than I did.   Let's start with the good... Our waiter was excellent, truly top notch. He was attentive without going overboard. The restaurant is lovely. Nice layout, comfortable tables. We were shown to a table immediately without a wait. The restaurant was relatively quiet, which I appreciate.  Now for the not as good... We ordered the tower of fish. They had two versions on the menu. Their standard one for $99 and the premium one for $172. We initially ordered the standard one thinking that ought to be enough to feed three of us (2 adults, 1 child).  We figured this would give us some variety. Our waiter suggested that the premium one would be more satisfactory since it was all we were ordering.They had several special fish on the menu that sounded delicious so we agreed. However, it turned out there was nothing special about the selection we received. 6 oysters, 6 crab legs, 4 pieces each of albacore, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi, 1 scallop and 6 shrimp. The tuna was so-so.  The rest was well prepared but there was nothing special or exotic about it. We also ordered the sake sampler which again stuck with fairly standard sakes. Nothing particularly interesting that you wouldn't have had if you enjoy sakes.  For the price, I was let down by the dullness of their selections. That issue aside what they did serve was fine though not spectacular.",

Full house, it took an hour to get our seats. We already had dinner so we didn't mind. We were asked if we would like an exclusive open bar option since we had to wait for so long. The majority of our party was nearly one shot wonders and passed on the kind offer. There was a live DJ. The restaurant had a good vibe to it. Despite the business, our server was very attentive.  We ordered a few desserts: creme brulee, fruit plate, ice cream/sherbet and a few drinks. They were out of creme brulee so the server gave us 2 banana flambes on the house. My sister and her bf wanted to try them so it turned out great. All the desserts were to our liking and presented beautifully.  Before midnight, the restaurant opened the balcony to show a direct view of the fireworks to be lit on the roof of Planet Hollywood. Champagne on the house was passed around for cheers. Countdown was amazing. We all had a wonderful time. We enjoyed the rest of the desserts and a few more drinks and left the restaurant around 1am. Nearly no traffic or any trouble getting out and escaping the strip.  A nice venue to celebrate New Year's Eve with your loved ones and to avoid the crowds.",

    "text": "Not bad for Vegas.  But is that really what you want when you're splurging on vacation?   I came here looking for an authentic Japanese meal.  They tell you the fish is flown in from Japan.  And to tell the truth, the food is not bad, it's just nothing special.  It's Americanized touristy stuff, without the exotic fish one finds in establishments that target connoisseurs.  The fish was certainly fresh, but that was not enough to overcome the abominable service.  That was unJapanese enough to ruin the meal.  The waitress didn't know the menu and had to go find the answers to our questions, until we got tired of asking.  Why is she even serving if she doesn't know what she's presenting to the customers?  We tried to ask the sushi chef about the menu, but his English was limited and he based his suggestion on how we could save money, when instead we wanted him to knock our socks off.  Then the bus boy took our plates away while we were still eating, which is downright rude.  I felt like just another tourist passing through a shiny hollow Vegas cash drainer.  I'm not coming back.",

The food: I had the Yellowtail Sashimi appetizer with diced chilies. For an appetizer, $17 is a bit high--the portions were a bit small, but this was so delicious. The chilies did not seem spicy to me /at all/ but the whole thing was really flavorful. I could have easily eaten a pound of this.   I got a few sashimi pieces (maguro, hamachi), and the crunchy spicy tuna roll. Yes, I evidently love tuna. At any rate, these were all really delicious and I was totally happy with my selections.   The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, and its location inside the forum shoppes is convenient.   Would definitely eat here again!",

Super friendly hostess met us at the door and walked us past the sushi bar where all the chefs hollered out a welcome.  Loved the decor--dark, rich, invitingly modern and warm without being dreary. Never having been here before, what did we do? A little of everything. Edamame beans as well as edamame hummus served with wonton crisps. Husband had salad with a delightful peanut-based dressing; I had crab miso soup that was good, but not worth the money. Better off just ordering standard miso soup.  Then came the rolls. A spicy tuna with a serious kick, and very good flavors. But my favorite? The Takana roll, which was draped with the most perfect, buttery yellowtail I have ever had in my life. It melted with each bite, and was the highlight of the meal...so much so that when we finally launched into our baked lobster roll, I did the unthinkable--I sent it back. It was positively bland and flavorless compared to the Takana roll, and was a real let-down following that amazing yellowtail. The manager, Gary Min, came over and removed it without batting an eye, and was incredibly gracious and accommodating from beginning to end. Our waitress, Tina, was also delightful, and very helpful and present without being overbearing.  Overall, a really good meal. We'll be back for sure!",

    "text": "I Love Sushi Roku :)  Ok, now that I've said that.. the review.   Came here after not being in Vegas for a couple years.. I'd just gotten tired with Vegas. We walk in and even after not having been here for 2yrs our waitress Jessica greeted us by our names! Impressive! We'd not made a rez, so she didn't get it via that method .. she just remembered. If I had that type of memory, well I'd be lucky.   While we'd like to check out the new Sushi Samba, and we know there are \"trendier\" places for sushi in Vegas, the service here is really what makes us repeat customers. There was a time when we would be in Vegas twice a month and would come here every time. The dining room/restaurant is chic, the view is amazing, and the food is fantastic but without the service we would probably spend more time exploring other places. It is as plenty of people have pointed out  \"pricey\", but it's Vegas and I've never thought of Vegas as a place to go when on a tight budget. In my opinion the price is justified by all the pluses of Roku.  The Food:  We started off a comped tuna carpaccio our lovely waitress brought for us. It was very flavorful and light at the same time. It was a great light starter. We nibbled it up too fast to get a picture.. sorry :x   Tuna sashimi with garlic chips and sesame soy. We order this every time we go to a Sushi Roku.. it's so good. I love the clean taste of the tuna complimented by the sesame soy and the little bites of garlic flavor, mixed with the crunchiness of the chips.. it's such a great bite to have all of those at once!  Kobe with king crab. I don't remember much of it, but I do remember liking it. I just think that I prefer my Kobe either raw or very rare and it was too cooked for me. Kobe is fine on it's own :) If you want to try something different tho and you like your Kobe on the cooked side, this dish may make you go \"mmm\"  Foie gras wrapped in yellowtail and sprinkled with edible gold. This is another thing we can't pass up. Every time we have it, I think we know it's great before we order it, but we don't fully remember just how decadent and divine it is until we actually eat it. It really is fabulous! I'm seeing less and less foie gras on menus. I know the Roku in Santa Monica dropped foie gras so I'm going to enjoy this while I can and when I can.  Kobe Yakiniku. This is the thin slices of kobe that you cook yourself, usually over a hot rock. We thought it would be a fun dish for my daughter. I had a piece and it was perfect, however the cooking method needs to go. Instead of a hot rock, they bring out a mini grill and the meat kept sticking to the grill. It wasn't easy to get it off with just two hands.. I had to hold the grill part down(because it wasn't attached) with my chopsticks, while my daughter peeled the meat off. And it smoked a lot! Like up to the ceiling.   Shrimp Tempura. It's shrimp tempura, I don't eat it my daughter does. That's that.  Sushi. We had Salmon, Tuna, Toro done two ways.. seared and not seared. Everything tasted super clean and the texture was perfection. I love the toro here and I get the feeling the sushi chefs here would never put something on your plate that they wouldn't eat. Some places have given me some nasty stuff. Never the case here. Only complaint, they forgot two or our seared toro.. apparently they didn't believe us when we ordered what we did haha.   The waitress brought us two comped desserts, which I myself was too full for. They were eaten and they were super cute and pretty so I imagine they were yummy as well :)  Cocktails. I love the drinks here! I have two things I usually stick with.. the lychee mojito and the lychee martini.. they are both delicious. Sometimes I get the Kyoto Rose, it's different and it's grown on me.. the rose flavor threw me off a bit the first time I tried it.  Sushi Roku is the mix of everything that makes me a fan of a restaurant.. great stetting, fantastic and attentive service and food that makes me and my mouth happy :) If you go ask for Jessica and tell her I said hi!",

Not sure if the oil in the deep fryer was burnt? But it was foul. Also, experience some severe fishy-ness in the couple of Tuna rolls we tried.   I could find better fish at a run-of-the-mill strip mall sushi restaurant. Too many great restaurants to bother with this one.",

The tuna carpaccio was fresh but lacked in flavor so I had to add soy sauce. The Kobe beef skewers were tender and juicy but I am not sure if they really were from Kobe. The chicken skewers were ok - afterall it is chicken. I recommend the Seaweed salad and Miso Eggplant Dengaku.  We were ready to order dinner and then a friend of mine got sick and left and her bf went after her. So my gf and I finished the apps and were full. We explained to the waiter that we had a problem with out friend and he understood but I felt bad for him since the place was almost empty.  One thing I noticed in a lot of Vegas restaurants is that they are so dark inside. It's draining. Liven up and be more fun, it'll increase business.",

My fiance and I got reservations here and were astounded with the view. You could see the entire strip from our table in a beautifully dimmed atmosphere that was everything we were looking for.   We started with the usual - sake and edamame. The hot sake was pretty good, but it was the sushi and sashimi that stole the show.   My personal favorite was the Katana. I have not had anything like it. The server also recommended the skipjack with my choice of yellow tail sashimi.  Big fan!",

Hostess was on the phone for an uncomfortably long time before she acknowledged us. We asked if we could sit next to the window and she said she would have to check. Almost 5 minutes passes! We are worried that she just forgot about us. She eventually comes back tells us we have take our baby out of the stroller and leave it at the front desk and attempts to seat us near the entrance (opposite side of restaurant) and not near the window. We asked again about the window and she acts as if we had never requested a window seat in the first place. Says she will have to check if there's a server in that area. She leaves us standing at the front to check and eventually comes back to seat us. Upon being seated we see 2 other tables with their waiter near the window! So obviously there was a waiter already serving the area. She didnt want us there....for what reason I dont know. So uncomfortable. Upon being greeted by our server we find out that happy hour only applys to outside area. Ok...fine we check out the menu and it looks nothing like the menu we viewed online. Totally bummed as my daughter wanted a bento box. We told the waiter we were bummed and he was nice and apologetic. We decide to just leave and as we walk out down the hallway the hostess passes us and just says \"dont forget your stroller on your way out\". So rude!!",

The atmosphere and food were good. We ordered dishes to share including a veggie roll, miso eggplant dengaku, and roasted cauliflower.   We liked everything but the tofu three ways. It's just three blocks of cold tofu, with different soy sauces and toppings. We ordered it without the caviar, but neither of us liked the truffle or kimchi one. This could just be us being picky eaters, but I didn't like that we left 95% of it untouched and the waitress didn't ask what was wrong; she just cleared the plate.  All in all, a nice pre-drinking dinner.",

The bf still talks about it a year later and says it changed his understanding of what good fish is.  The rolls are totally forgettable and very small for what you pay. I honestly can't recall what else we ate there.  The service is great - everyone is a real sweetheart and our server had a wonderfully dry sense of humor. She also helped us stay within our budget (we tend to go WAY overboard when we do a la carte).   The sake was served at the perfect temperature.   Honestly, the three stars are because I think your money is better spent elsewhere in Vegas and because there's such a huge difference in quality/value in items on the menu. The sashimi was some of the best I've ever had, the rolls were some of the worst.   But the fluke was so good that the bf suggested going back just for that.",

    "text": "We ate here on the first day of our trip to Las Vegas. We quickly learned that happy hour was the best time to check out the restaurants we were most looking forward to, Sushi Roku was one. Located at the forum shoppes at Caesars, we were quickly pleased with their happy hour menu, lots of delicious choices.   There was not a huge amount of bar seating, a smaller bar and a family style high top table were the only options. We ended up having to wait a little for two seats together. After we did we were quickly greeted by our waiter.   I ordered Hanabi- spicy tuna on crispy rice, an organic garden salad with yuzu ginger, a salmon avocado roll, shrimp tempura with asparagus and Wagyu Skewers (not on happy hour menu) along with a glass of their happy hour champagne.   I loved the hanabi. It was absolutely delicious and something I have never had before. The salad was not the typical Japanese salad I was hoping for, it was just Ok, this was something I could have done without. The salmon avocado roll was delicious and exactly what I was hoping it would be. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked the shrimp tempura with asparagus because typically I don't care for asparagus. So far, so good.   Here is where I knocked off a star for the overall review. Never having wagyu before I didn't know what to expect it to look or taste like but I have heard incredible things about this particular meat. I was very clear in ordering the Wagyu skewers. However come to find out thats not what I got and unfortunately I didn't realize until after I had ate them. I saw a plate of actual beef and skewers pass me and I realized...thats definitely not what I got and I didn't even enjoy it. So I looked back at the menu and what I received was the Rib-eye wrapped asparagus. How does one screw that up? They don't even sound similar. But again, I just figured okay the asparagus was the skewer and I had no idea what the Wagyu would have tasted like because I had never had it. I was beyond disappointed. I called over the server and I asked him what it was that was brought to me. He said, It was the rib eye asparagus. I kindly replied, that wasn't what I ordered. His response \"oh I rang it in wrong\" ... no apology or anything? Then not only that, but I was charged for what I didn't even order and mistakenly ate. Had I not ate it, I would not have accepted this but being that I ate it I just let it go. However being that he acknowledged he rang it in wrong, he should have compensated in some way. This was incredibly disappointing.   Overall we enjoyed our meal. Aside from our server- issues and the rib eye wrapped asparagus which I did not enjoy, I would still recommend this for anyone looking for a sushi happy hour.",

Keep in mind that there is no all you can eat and it can get pricey very quickly, but the price is sure worth the taste. All the fish melts in your mouth like butter. The oysters are of the freshest and tastiest I've ever had! Their shrimp tempura is done in dish a style where the breading doesn't feel overbearing or dry, it has a rich juicy flavor that doesn't stop. If the food was t enough they have some amazing cocktails that pair well with your meal.",

Service was just as good and attentive. Only paid a little less than $20. Definitely coming here again whenever my next visit to Vegas is and try something new from Roku.",

    "text": "Let me just say straight off the bat; yes, the prices are expensive for what it is. But keep in mind, all restaurants and foods are usually overly priced on The Strip.   Besides that, food was delicious! Boyfriend and I wanted to try the brussel sprouts chips but they were out for the day. -__- what!? awwwwww......man! So we got gyoza dumplings and the seabass sliders (one order came with two) as appetizers. The sliders were my boyfriend's favorite item of the night. The tartar-type sauce had a kick to it. The seabass was crispy. We would definitely order that again.  We decided to order three kinds of sushi. As a staple, we always get an order of spicy tuna roll at any sushi/Japanese restaurant we go to. This one here, ehhhhh....it was only alright. We could definitely do without. Average and I've had spicier, better ones at other places.  We also order the Shima roll: shrimp on top of spicy tuna, cilantro and avocado. It looked like it was wrapped in soy paper. And we got the Baked Lobster roll in a creamy miso sauce. Both those rolls will definitely be a repeat.  Only reason why I gave it 4 stars (really a 4 1/2 star review) was because we really wanted to try the brussel sprout chips. If they had it available that night, this might have been a perfect 5 star rating. Plus I know the prices here might turn some people off. We got two drinks, two appetitzers, 3 sushi rolls and our total was a little over $100.00. Overall, I have no hesitation to come back here (if I want to splurge on sushi).",

I was really excited that I got to have an order of Uni and the rolls were just as wonderful. We had Katana Roll, White Lotus (our favorite of the 3), and Titan Roll.

The ladies poised at the podium up front were all smiles and will be very quick to guide you to your seat. The lady at the bar was pleasant and helpful in her suggestions of what dishes were most popular (as well as her personal favorites).  Next, le food. Oh lawd. Each dish was elegantly plated, the food on the plates were excellent in quality and taste. I don't know how to put into words how happy the food made me. Turn to the pictures for a deeper understanding of what these morsels look like.  Finally, decor. VERY cool stuff. From the layout of the restaurant and seating, to the art on the bathroom - Sushi Roku made the food, the view, and the experience very much worth it! I'll definitely be back again.",

I stopped him and nicely asked him to pour the rest of the sake before taking it, and he got upset and poured the drink fast and said:  \"you drink a lot!\"  First of all:  Why does he care???????

To end our mini vacation in Vegas, my family and I selected Sushi Roku as our last lunch spot before heading home and we couldn't have chosen any better. Located in Caeser's, Sushi Roku is on the second floor and offers a marvelous view of the strip for your dining pleasure. Inside, there are plenty of tables and since we were grabbing a later lunch, we didn't have to wait long to be seated.  One of my BIGGEST regrets was not getting our waitress's name because she was absolutely amazing. Not only did she surprise us by busting out in Vietnamese, impressing my entire family with her clarity, but she also came by frequently to check on us and gave great explanations of each dish as they arrived to our table. Her service alone deserves five stars.  Portion sizes at Sushi Roku aren't too large so for a party like ours, nine people in total, it definitely meant ordering multiples. We chose a variety of dishes such as: yellowtail diced chiles, fluke kumquat sashimi, baked cod \"saikyo-yaki,\" beef rib eye wrapped asparagus, spicy pork belly \"kakuni\" fried rice, the spider roll, and the Katana roll.   The yellowtail sashimi was mighty spicy, but mighty delicious while the fluke sashimi had a more refreshing flavor profile, thanks to the sweet kumquat. The beef rib eye was cooked on an iron hot stone, creating a sizzle that would make anyone's mouth water in anticipation. The meat was tender and the asparagus had a good crunch as well. The baked cod, however, was melt-in-your-mouth buttery and literally fell apart with the slightest touch. The miso sauce was sweet, but never once overpowered that delectable fish.  One of my favorite dishes was the kakuni fried rice with pieces of fatty pork belly. It is definitely not a waistline-friendly dish, but your taste buds will thank you profusely. The Katana roll was dressed in a creamy, spicy mayo sauce that added a buttery flavor to the yellowtail and spicy tuna while the spider roll was a bit more simplistic.   Because portions aren't too great, we all still had room for dessert so we ordered the yuzu creme brulee with green teen ice cream as well as the green tea tiramisu. My pick for the best dessert had to be the green tea tiramisu. It was an incredibly light and airy dessert that had you inhaling the whole piece without all the guilt. The matcha flavor was prominent and paired well the espresso layers. The yuzu creme brulee had a refreshing orange-like taste and the green tea ice cream was deliciously smooth.  With food of this quality, it's no surprise that breaking the bank is a must. But even though you won't feel stuffed silly, I'm certain you'll still remember every dish with fondness.   Sushi Roku is outstanding!",

As I was reading the menu I couldn't decide what to order,so I did my usual and started off with dessert. Chocolate volcano cake and the banana flambe. The chocolate cake was rich,moist,decadent and came with a scoop of ice cream that worked really well with it.The flambe was just like the name,simply  bananas.The next item I was eyeing,Pork belly with egg on top of spicy fried rice.If I could give a dead man walking a last meal,this would definitely be it.The pork wasn't to fatty and the egg actually help calm the spice of the rice to balance out the dish. Most of the sushi items were great but some them were not at room temperature and had a little to much ponzu sauce but that's just my tastebuds.  Overall this was a great dining experience and must  give them a 4.5 star rating.All points were hit I just feel they came up a little short on some of their items.Great ambiance and decor mixed in with chill eclectic beats make it a must if ones hanging out in Vegas and looking for a sushi spot.I am out,Peace",

My partner and I shared a few rolls and dessert together.. and I must say it is not an exaggeration that I had a culinary experience similar to that of exploding fireworks! We were thrilled (and disappointed at the same time) to pay the bill at the end.   I was particularly intrigued by the ability of the masters behind this food to capture these amazing smokey flavors in sushi that I had otherwise never experienced before.   I highly recommend going here for either a romantic experience for two, or for taking out your team for an amazing meal! You could certainly see that the patrons all fell between these two categories judging by the Expo name tags and dressed up couples.  We will definitely be back.",

For sushi rolls we had the crunchy spicy tuna w/ spicy mayo, and the white lotus. I like the white lotus better it had a more fresh spicy kick with the raw jalapeno slice on top!",

Quality of fish was top notch plus I really appreciated how the katana roll wasn't swimming in spicy mayo. The wagyu beef was amazing.   It was perfectly seasoned on the outside and had a soft buttery rare center that melted in your mouth. One of the items we ordered was out so they substituted with a rib eye wrapped asparagus which was delicious. Our toddler enjoyed the vegetable tempura and the noodles from the ramen. Service was great; they were very nice to us with young kids in tow. This place is worth every penny.",

Limited selection of lower priced drinks and cocktails aren't part of the deal at all. Surprisingly good little deserts for $4.   Their sushi is much better than your average place. Very fresh with tender rice makes it worth it whether you're paying half or full price. The menu is pretty traditional. No weird combo rolls here. Just great quality. The creativity on the menu is in the hot and cold appetizers. Yum.  One bummer thing is their cocktails. Don't bother. I tried 2 - a ginger lychee mojito where I couldn't taste the ginger and the lychee and mint were served as garnish and not in the drink. So this drink was a rum and lime where the lime was a tart mixer. I don't like like my cocktails deconstructed thanks. So I tried a different drink...Cant remember the name but it was supposed to be a spicy vodka lime cocktail. Again the drink came deconstructed with the chili skewered on top as a garnish so the drink itself wasn't spicy. The lime was so tart I asked for simple syrup to sweeten it up and make it drinkable. Insult to injury, both the drinks came in short glasses with one huge ice cube that took up almost the whole glass do you couldn't possibly mix in the 'deconstructed' drink components. Avoid the cocktails!  Stick with the food.",

The Wagyu skewer was cooked to perfection... and it was very tasty. We also had the salmon nigiri, wagyu gyoza, a handroll, & pork belly fried rice. The pork belly was delicious.  Overall, this place is one of the finest sushi place I've ever been to. I really liked the interior as well. Service was great, so that's definitely a plus.",

He doesn't eat sushi but his lady and I both love it, and we all left Sushi Roku very happy with our meals.  Sushi Roku is located on the third floor of The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, almost directly above the valet (so really easy to find). The space is sleek and sexy, and we had a great view of the Strip from our booth. Service was excellent all night;  patient (we are a chatty group and I think our waiter must have come back to take our order 5 times before we decided on anything) accommodating to special requests and able to answer the plethora of questions we had about the menu.   Highlights from our meal would be:   Brussel Sprout Chips with truffle oil - addictively delicious  Spicy Pork Belly Fried Rice - My brother in law was so in love with this dish he had the waiter bring out another order before he was even halfway finished. He was kind enough to share the pork belly which was absolutely divine.  American Wagyu Beef Skewer - The pork belly stole the spotlight, but this skewer was a close second. Melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness.  Albacore Sashimi - Super fresh and served with a nice, light ponzu sauce  I didn't see the check so I can not tell you what our meal set us back, but based on how happily my brother-in-law paid it, our meal was obviously worth every penny to him and that's all that really matters to me. I will absolutely return to Sushi Roku in the future,",

The food here is ok, a bit on the pricey side for what you get as nothing really stuck out for me as good nor recommendable. The establishment itself is fairly nicely decorated and has a decent location within the forum shops overlooking the Las Vegas strip. The ambiance is pretty cool with nice decor and quite a functional layout. The cuisine and service however just didn't do it for me and there are several better options for sushi consumption in Las Vegas.   Pros- Nice location  Ambiance  Great sake selection   Cons- Below average food  Small portions  Somewhat confused staff  Price per portion ratio is not great  Lacks any sort of \"wow\" factor for the price point",

    "text": "I hate shopping because it makes me hungry. So, after a half a day of shopping at Forum Shops, we went to Sushi Roku. They have big tables and couches so you're not cramped/ feeling claustrophobic.  Since we weren't terribly hungry, we only ordered a few rolls/nigiri ($7-22 or market price): black truffle tempura handroll, salmon, albacore uni and tuna. We also ordered from the specials menu ($6-90). With a glass of Riesling in hand, we got...  Yellowtail-wrapped Foie Gras with Truffle Soy: My eyes automatically scope out \"foie gras\" and \"truffle\" and send a signal to my taste buds that I'm about to have something amazing in my mouth. So amazing that my hands did not get a signal to take pictures. You'll just have to try it to know how beautiful this is. 5/5  Robata Style Japanese Wagyu Beef with Hawaiian Pink Salt: You get a nice presentation of your skewer on its own robata grill and a spoon with pink rock salt. The wagyu is tender and fatty - feels nice on the tongue. The pink salt accentuates the flavor of the wagyu. 5/5  Scallop and Foie Gras Togarashi with Black Pepper and White Truffle Oil: It's like a re-run of the first dish I had except this time, I got distracted by the black pepper taste. The scallops were perfectly cooked. 4/5  Blue Fin Tuna Sushi: The fish was at the right temperature. The texture of the rice was just right. The fish to rice ratio was perfect. 5/5  Black Truffle Tempura Handroll: This is wrapped in a thin soy paper. There's avocado inside. The truffle flavor is in the sauce. 4/5  The service was excellent. Our server was attentive.",

We have noticed alot of sushi restaurants are Phillipino owned and operated however if the fish is DNA real and the knife is sharp we eat.   A few years back we searched best sushi in vegas just to test the area. We figured VEGAS being VEGAS the who's who would eat sushi. I don't recall the name my wife found but it was behind an escalator down a hall across from a sports bar, it was a True hole. This place was unbelievable great. 6 years later we did same search as our daughter (9) loves sushi everyone and there mother has a sushi restaurant.   My wife picked Roku. We sat down and it was a typical restaurant  other to flashy but sushi bar was awesome long and chef's were very visible. I scanned the menu and wow the prices were outrageously high like Toro was 26$, Halibut was 18$, saki by the glass Nigori super $$$ and it was a small glass. We decided to stay and try it is got Albacore, Halibut, Toro, seaweed salad, saki. The Toro was old and mushy, Halibut was tail ends and chewy if you know Halibut you would know this was awful and a cheap cut, the Albacore was very thin and almost white. My son got typical spicy tuna rolls and 1 lobster hand they were TINY. My wife well same. Daughter well same. Our bill usually runs 100 to 125 locally and we're treated like royalty I'm talking everything from desert being free to chef compliments in sushi. Roku was 345$.   We were thinking wow like we didn't get the special water or anything. We watched another family gorge and fancy water for the kids and this roasted marshmallow desert. Another family looked to be locals sat. Started ordering and we thought man we must be cheap or over our heads nope. The waitress brought all kinds of fancy things and the mom said he'll no we drink tap water, get drunk before you come in, and order cheap. I asked her why just go to a different place she said they work near by. By the way we came here at 630 and the place was empty. When we left we talked to a guy that ate at the bar and he too said the most expensive fish he has ever ate.  So if your in the mood to look important and spend but get average fish this is the place.",

We were greated right away and sat at the bar because we wanted happy hour.  There were hot and cold appetizers, sushi, sashimi and desserts to chose from.  Wine and cocktails were 5 dollars i believe.  We ordered the spicy scallop role, the spicy tuna roll, the calamari and the albacore sashimi. Everything was really good.  My favorite was the albacore.  It came with crunchy onion bits and they gave you really decent size pieces for 5 dollars.  The fish was tender, fresh and delicious.  The calimari was good too.  Squid was really small so it was a little over-fried.  I wanted more of a chewy texture.  Came with a sweet plum sauce to dip.      The rolls were really good too.  I really liked the spicy tuna.  The bartender told us to order it with rice paper because she likes it so much better and we did.  It was alright..and we got charged a dollar extra for it.  But the fish was good and their sauce was more than just sriracha.  I also liked the spicy scallop roll but it was not as fresh as I hoped it to be.  A little too much mayo in it too.    Drinks were good as well.  We ordered wines and they have good house selections for the price.  I would definitely come back for happy hour and for their regular menu.  Place is not crowded at all so it will be quite easy to get a table if you don't go at a prime hour.  Can't wait to visit again!",

We prefer to sit @ sushi bar, engage chefs & watch them make our dinner right in front of us for a full experience. Sushi Roku will not disappoint. I do recommend making a reservation & maybe next time we'll check out Happy Hour, I read prices are great! Till next time Sushi Roku!",

And that organic salad is definitely organic. We had the hanabi \"crispy rice\" for appetizers and you definitely should try it. It's really yummy. As for the sushi. I wasn't super impressed, but it was good. Usually I stay for dessert at restaurants, but I felt like the atmosphere made me feel uncomfortable. It felt like the workers were a little judgmental, as if we didn't have money to eat there or tip. Which is unTrue. I would never go to a place and not have money for either. So ya I didn't get to try their desserts.",

They have an excellent happy hour with some great sushi deals (currently 30% off their specialty rolls). This time we ordered a spicy scallop roll which was so good we ended up getting two, as well as a California roll, which was also excellent. We also got a couple of their apps--ribeye wrapped asparagus and brussels sprouts with bacon. All of them were DELICIOUS. We sat at the bar and the lovely bartender was attentive and friendly but not obnoxious. The place can be a little hard to find as you wander through the mall from Caesar's Palace (it is up on the third floor), but it is well worth the hunt. The decor and ambiance are great, and if you sit out by the windows, you get great strip views. I highly recommend Sushi Roku!",

This was the first time I've actually been there for dinner.    Our dining consisted of the following items:  Appetizers (compliments of the host):  Filet Mignon Asparagus w/Soy Mirin Sauce 16 This was ok, didn't leave a lasting impression on me.  Japanese Yellow Tail Sashimi w/diced chilies 17 The Yellow Tail is a must have.  The fish was fresh and melts in your mouth.   KaraAge with Cilantro Mayo 12 The chicken was prepared just right and with the cilantro mayo, it was quite yummy.  Rolls: Shima Roll: Shrimp wrapped Spicy Tuna w/Cilantro & Avocado 18 This roll was quite heavenly.  Entrees: Grilled Fillet Mignon w/homemade Terriyaki Sauce and Mashed Potatos 36 The fillet mignon was tender and cooked to perfection.    Chilean SeaBass w/Truffle Miso Glazed and Sauteed Spinach 28 The seabass was pure perfection, cooked medium w/the truffle miso glaze... My mouth waters just thinking about it..  Sauteed Salmon & Hokkaido Scallops; XO sauce with Asparagus & Potatoes 26  The presentation of this entree was pretty cool.  The fish and scallops were cooked just right.  Desserts: The Chocolate Volcano Souffle was quite delectable.    I was surprised with a some sort of Fruit Cup Birthday dessert which had blackberries, carmelized bananas, strawberries, and raspberries.    The ambiance and decor is quite appealing. As always the service is impeccable.  I would like to thank Kenji for being such a wonderful host and great dining experience.",

While you get a good amount of food for the price, the quality was lacking. The meat was too chewy and gristley. The sashimi was OK and nothing spectacular to rave about.   However, the a-la-carte items were phenomenal. My friend ordered the premium homemade tofu three ways, one with black truffle, one with caviar and lemon oil, and the last with scallion and sesame oil. Tofu was silky and smooth and almost hard to grab with your chopsticks as it would break into pieces when you grabbed a hold of it.  I ordered the chicken karaage with cilantro mayo. I enjoyed the light crispy coating surrounding the meaty pieces of chicken. The cilantro mayo was a nice condiment but I didn't notice the flavor of the cilantro too much despite the light green color of the mayo.  Service was good, except for the server for getting my order of Sprite so I had to ask for it again. At least she came by later and gave me a refill when I didn't ask for one.  Lesson learned this time, Sushi Roku. I'll be back to try more of your delicious a-la-carte items. Hopefully with more money to spend.",

The six of us were seated at an awesome round table with a super view of the Las Vegas strip.  We started with a large order of sake-bombing materials (two of the six were sake-bombing virgins!) and a couple of the signature cocktails. I tried the lycee mojito which was good but not lycee-y enough and the other girls loved the tropical peach passion and lycee martini.   We ordered a wide variety of dishes to share and for personal consumption. I liked the crispy chicken appetizer with yummy dipping sauce and the spicy tuna and california rolls. I usually love eel sushi but our eel was overly fishy. Summer tried a signature roll with tuna, cilantro, and more which was yummy though wasabi-infused and spicy! The salty edaname were also very good and Rachel couldn't stop raving about the sea bass main dish.   Our sweet waitress gave us a complimentary birthday sake jug and a fun mini-birthday celebration of molten chocolate cake and a crazy sparkler. For about $65 each, we all left satiated and ready to party!",

The jalapeno white tuna roll sounded interesting and it turned out plain awful. After the waiter saw I was not enjoying it one bit, he asked if it was ok and I said I dont like it at all and he started explaining why it is a creative fusion dish.

    "text": "The flavors were great in the rolls we ordered, and it was very clear the quality of the fish was high and fresh.  However I wish especially in the specialty rolls that there was a better balance and variety in texture. When a roll is specially designed like that it is always nice for me to have an element of crispness or crunch that was not present in the majority of the sushi we ordered.  We had two of the gin specialty drinks in the menu and they were extremely refreshing!  Lovely, aromatic mixtures though the cucumber garnish was not in great condition.  Ambiance was nice -- competition with Tao it would seem.     Our server as well was sweet though it seemed he was a but overwhelmed... It took him a while to get our last roll to us, and he double checked with us on the order at least 5 mins after he should have already punched it in.  Overall,  I might not dine here again because it was extremely expensive, and I'd rather explore other Vegas options.",

It was an awesome deal and we took advantage of it.  During this Vegas weekend, I went to Sushi Roku, Okada, and Sushisamba....Sushi Roku was my favorite. The sushi rolls were awesome...I ordered all of the rolls my waiter recommended and the most expensive ones too.....heck it was 50% off!  They were all good, however, I wasn't a big fan of the lobster roll.    We did encounter some problems with service, however.  It seemed our waiter disappeared on us.  We ordered another round of drinks and it never showed up.  We asked another waiter to check on our drinks and she said it was coming soon...but still no drinks appeared.  We asked yet another waiter to find out about our drinks...finally the manager came and apologized and offered our round of drinks for free.  Since our round of drinks was offered for free,  we still enjoyed our time at Sushi Roku.  The food was awesome, drinks were great, ambiance was cool, but service is a little lacking. Okada had better service but I didn't think food was as good and I would prefer to go back to Sushi Roku next time I'm in Vegas.",

On the brighter side, it was a business lunch so the price tag didn't hurt as much as it should have.  All in all, the food was really great. It wasn't the best sushi I've had, but it was pretty close.  I really dig spicy food, so the spicy tuna with jalapeos really hit the spot! Also had a \"Shima Roll\" which I highly recommend... spicy tuna, shrimp, soy paper, and hot sauce. Yummy!",

She ordered a cornucopia of sushi (salmon, toro, one handroll with tempura shrimp and asparagus) that she devoured and was highly pleased with. I had the 'new' chicken salad and some mixed tempura (veg and seafood). Both were good but I really liked the chicken salad. The dressing is that sweet miso-y dressing you can some times get at some Japanese restaurants.     The service was really wonderful. Our waiter was highly attentive to our needs and my water glass wasn't allowed to be less than half full. We appreciated it.    The price was pretty high for a couple of women on limited budgets. My salad was $16 and the tempura was $12. I have no idea how much J's platter o'sushi was but it wasn't for the faint of heart. But you are paying for quality, not quantity.",

However, Sushi Roku did a pretty good job of taking care of my friends' birthday dinner here.   Recommendation #1: Chilean sea bass with truffle miso glaze. Though it's listed as an appetizer it was big enough to be an entree.  Recommendation #2: Kurobuta kakuni. I ordered this for myself, but the rest of the birthday party descended on it like a flock of vultures before I even got a bite.  The plate came back to me with only the veggies and brown rice :( but I'm guessing the pork was really good?  I would recommend Sushi Samba at the Palazzo over Sushi Roku only because Samba has a more unique menu that imo is worth shelling out a few extra bucks for.  But if you're looking for more traditional Japanese flavors, Roku gives you more bang for your buck in a similarly high end setting.",

    "text": "AMAZING!! My husband and I dined here for my birthday this past weekend and although I was at first let down by not getting a view seat due to a private party, the food more than made up for it!   We started with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Chilies appetizer which was recommended to us by our waiter after attempting to order the Crudo Roku sashimi tasting. He said it was much better, and it was actually a few bucks less so we took his advice and loved it! The chilies added a great flavor to the Yellowtail and the presentation was great.   We then moved on to the Shima Roll and the Albacore with Scallions cut roll. That Shima Roll...OMG...pure heaven!! I'm pretty sure it is the best roll I've ever had!! The combination of textures and flavors was pure perfection.  The avocado was so soft and ripe, the tuna was buttery and wonderful, and the cilantro and little dab of hot sauce added just the right amount of zing. The Albacore was also wonderful as were the subsequent items we ordered, the Live Halibut sushi and the Toro & Jalapeno Roll.  We enjoyed a carafe of sake during our meal and indulged in a few sake bombs before I finished with their wonderful Lychee Martini. I was then surprised with an awesome chocolate souffle birthday dessert! I was so stuffed already but managed to polish it off!   The service was great as our waiter was very attentive and friendly. Though the prices are indeed a bit high, I felt it was worth it for the wonderful food, ambiance and service. We look forward to coming back to Sushi Roku the next time we're in Vegas and will also make it a point to try out the other locations in LA next time we're up that way! We've dined at their Katana Restaurant in Hollywood (see review) and loved it equally as well!",

For what we paid for the entire meal we could eat twice at the best sushi restaurant in Atlanta (which blows this place away).  Most annoying was the \"Tofu 3 Ways\"... It was 6 slabs of raw tofu taken directly from the package with 3 \"ingredients\" sprinkled on top.  I think one was caviar, one maybe scallions and I don't recall the third (it was that forgettable).  Really a 6 year old could assemble this dish with minimal adult assistance.  The shrimp tempura roll was fine but nothing special and small compared to what would be found at the average sushi restaurant.  The tuna carpaccio was good (for $26) but overpriced for what it was.  The seaweed salad was good and we also really enjoyed the king crab fried rice but beware that it does have some sort of hidden pork not disclosed on the menu.  Finally, while trying to enjoy a relaxing evening out, it's kind of difficult when the waiter is jacked up on something, and running around like a maniac.  Really, as we dined at this place, I came to realize the reality of Las Vegas, shiny and glitzy on the outside, but in reality built to draw in suckers.  However that's another review for another time.  Not recommended.",

If you come here, you are paying for the name.    We came here for lunch so it was a slow afternoon.  We got a table right away without a reservation.  Ordered a $6 miso soup (since I was feeling under the weather) and it sucked...nothing special for such an expensive soup. The tuna sashimi...delicious; the rolls....terrible and bland.  DO NOT come here for the rolls!  The drinks were just okay.  If you are looking for overpriced sushi, then come here.",

The waitress we had was so wonderful, kind and attentive. They had a special king crab fried rice and they were able to modify it gluten free for me. I tried the baked lobster roll, which I didn't care much for, but the hand king crab rolls were delicious! My husband loved the shrimp tempura with jalapenos, something a little different. This place will definitely be added to our list for our next trip back!",

We all had a round of cocktails to start out and then ordered a ton of sushi.  I would highly recommend the Tuna Poke with wonton chips, it was a yummy appetizer.  We also tried a few different rolls and had AMAZING yellowtail sashimi.  I could've eaten the entire plate myself.  The only thing that wasn't great was the butterfish and I think it was just a personal preference.    It was my birthday weekend and they generously let me pick a dessert of the menu.  I tried the donuts which were filled with ganache and had dipping sauces with them.  It was probably one of the better desserts I've eaten in Vegas.  They also brought out a huge obnoxious sparkler with it which was fun!",

Waiter never came back after taking initial order.  Splash the $18 (5oz) sake on his trade, and did not say any.  Ordered the assorted sushi.  Rice too dry, no moist.  Not enough vinegar tan in my humble opinion.      Do not come with high hope.  Random sushi place in Japan would probably exceed this place.  PS.  Choose Nobu, similar price, much higher quality.  They're only open after 5pm.  Hence me being here sharing a friendly warning.",

Our server was very nice and extremely helpful. Gave us a run down on the sushi and offered great recommendations.   The sushi concoctions here are unique but a bit on the pricey side ($20-30/roll). We ordered the Katana Roll (spicy tuna and shrimp tempura on top of tuna and yellowtail), the Shima Roll and the Baked Lobster with Miso Sauce. The Shima Roll was excellent with a nice melding of flavors -- shrimp, spicy tuna, avocado and cilantro. The Katana Roll had a funky sauce drizzled on it -- not a big fan. My boyfriend loved the Lobster Roll -- generous pieces with a mouth-watering taste.   Sushi Roko is a nice choice for couples, friends or large groups.  The atmosphere is fun, hip and elegant. Just be prepared for a big lunch/dinner tab. Our lunch bill topped $100 with no alcohol and I still had a little bit of an appetite when we left. Awesome sushi and vibe though!",

    "text": "DESSERT.  I know, I know, it's a sushi restaurant - the fish dishes were great and the service was topnotch.  But what stood out to my boyfriend and me was the last part of our meal.  His three Pate Choux were filled with different-flavored housemade ice creams accompanied by a small cup of melted chocolate; each was unique and we loved these light and airy puffs!  My rice tuile cup filled with mango, green tea, and sesame (?) seed ice creams resting on a bed of delicious apple pie filling was FABULOUSLY inventive and pulled together very well!  Presentation of these dishes was artistically appealing.  Loved the vibe.  Beautiful, romantic night scene of the Strip played out before us from the large picture windows, and we were seated Monday night at one of the cushy tables along the opposite wall (which can fit 6), so BOTH of us were able to look across the entire dining room and out through the windows.  The space was much bigger than it looks from the entrance inside The Forum shops.  All I can say is the sushi dishes were outstanding.  Delicately displayed, each plate contained quality, fresh ingredients, and it all tasted as good as it looked (we ordered 3 dishes before the dessert).  Sure, everything is a little pricey, but what isn't along the Strip?  At least this one was actually worth it.  Service was excellent; in fact, the best I experienced at any food establishment in Las Vegas during our time here in Sep 2012.  We were seated right away even though we were 20 minutes earlier than our reservation, and our server and team were coordinated, quietly friendly, and discreetly responsive.  There were no pretentious airs.   I would not hesitate to go there again and give it my full recommendation.",

I'd also order the popcorn shrimp with miso glaze again ($6). You have to sit at the cocktail bar to get the HH specials which was no problem, besides the 10 bar stools there is a separate long table with maybe 15 seats that also counts as the HH area.

I sat at the bar and my server, an inked young lady whose name slips my mind, cordially suggested their Happy Hour menu. I obliged and quite honestly, I had ten very good sushi rolls and a drink for around $15, a 1/4 of what they wanted for the buffet at the opposite end of the Palace. I had the spicy tuna and something with salmon. Both were fresh, not over spiced so much that you couldn't taste the fish, and a nice serving. Service was attentive, quick and spot on with the recommendation. I'll stop in here again if I get a Jones for sushi while on the strip. The lounge itself is rather nice as well and would make a quality spot for a dinner date too, if I had a date (groan...). Maybe next time.",

We wanted for nothing and the service was magnificant.    We had the Sparkling Blueberry Sake, amazing.  At $12 a shot we were a bit skeptical but it's so worth it.

We had sashimi, wagyu beef, tempura, sushi and ended up paying $1500+ for a party of 9, plus a hard $300 service fee, which is crazy because we only ordered platters to share. The waitress was busy and we had to call on her a few times to order things. Not the best service around town but charging too high. Don't go there!",

    "text": "Sushi Roku is an excellent sushi restaurant, my favorite in LV, and one of my favorites in the USA.  You can fall into the trap that I always fall into- which is ordering a ton of the most expensive sushi- but you can also take a more reasonable path and eat lunch specials, omakase plates, etc, and you will save your wallet.  The quality has always been consistently excellent.  They generally have excellent, juicy / fatty toro, and the nigiri slices are generously cut and well executed.  Although I seldom eat rolls, they have a creative selection.    **LV residents should note that they give a 20% off locals discount- huge score!  I will always return to Sushi Roku when in LV- absolutely love it!  Highly recommended for all levels of 'sushi expertise', and the non-sushi menu (which I don't venture into) is extensive enough to satisfy non-sushi eaters as well.  Enjoy!",

Monkfish Liver sushi was a nice change. Never had it before and actually I don't recall seeing it on other menus. Not bad. I'd order it again.  Tako roll was small. A let down compared to the amazing presentation of fish.  The takeaway here is high quality in an upscale location with warm charm and great service. You do pay for what you get but it's worth it. I'll be back for dinner with friends.",

Yeah, but not outragous. We splurged on $125 bottle of champagne and got dessert and I think it came to $260 for two people.

    "text": "This is a small California based chain. The atmosphere at the sushi bar is OK but needs work. For example, when you first arrive, you are greeted loudly (good). However, after that most of the sushi chefs are silent. Only one chef (left most, perhaps the most senior) was a little talkative. On the positive side, the patrons were very friendly; I don't know if this is normal, or was just a coincidence.  In my two meals at the sushi bar, I've tried: * ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). Five medium slices; firm, with a very rich texture. Excellent. * uni (sea urchin). Pretty good, but wasn't as firm or tasty as it could be. * ama-ebi (raw shrimp). Good overall. The heads were served tempura style, but were not as juicy or as crispy as they should be. * awabi (abalone). Good * unagi (barbecued eel). Pretty standard. It should have been hotter and a little crisp. * hamachi (yellowtail). Good. * Smoked salmon wrapped ankimo topped with toro tartar, uni and caviar. It also included a layer of spinach, and gold leaf was placed on top. There were three pieces, each piece too big to eat in one bite, so eating it was tricky. Other than that, it was very tasty.  * Bincho maguro (albacore). Seared, topped with onion and a vinegary sauce. Good to very good. * Kohada (shad) served with shiso leaf. Moderately strong flavor, but milder than other similar fish (like saba/mackeral). Very good.  The sushi was generally very good, but not quite up to the standards of Hyakumi or Okada. It was cheaper than Hyakumi but no cheaper than Okada. Keep in mind that I'm comparing Sushi Roku to my two favorite sushi bars in all of Las Vegas.",

We expected some good sushi out of this place, but was not impressed at all.  The sushi was mediocre, and so was the rest of the food.  Nothing we ordered stood out.
