Their pizzas are very unique in name and flavor which I like because it changes it up from the norm.  Customer service always seems to be spot on. I've never had any issues with service.  The only reason why I give it a 4 star is because of the volume in the restaurant. The music is too loud. 9 out of 10 times I can't hear the person next to me.  Love Pizza Rock!!",

Normally I'd be fine because I'm not neurotic but having been given plates encrusted in dirty food I was grossed out so asked for a new pizza. The response from server: \"it's going to be a while since you requested a new one.\"  I assure you I'm neither demanding nor rude. If I wanted to eat unsanitary food off of unclean plates I would eat on the streets.   Sad experience. Spare your efforts.  The pizza rock downtown at least embraces quality service and standards.",

    "text": "First of all, I don't like restaurants with celebrity chefs.  Just because the chef has his/her name on it and the recipes are theirs, doesn't mean the QC of the food is there.  Tony G has brought his recipes and his attitude to Vegas and it works.  Very well.  That being said, forget this restaurant has the word \"pizza\" in its name.  Yes, the pizza is the best in town (most probably the best in the US), but it's the Italian food that makes this place the best west of the Mississippi.  The pasta is made in house daily, the beer selection is top notch, the portions are enormous without sacrificing quality, and the taste will send you into a frenzy of singing \"Santa Lucia.\"  We started with the deep fried artichoke hearts and the salumi and cheese plate.  The artichokes didn't survive the first 30 seconds on the table, and there was so much salumi and cheese and fresh foccacia that we had to bring it home.  Next we ordered the sausage and peppers dinner and a Neapolitan Margarita pizza.  Forget everything you know about Neapolitan pie.  This will make you reevaluate what you did with your life before you tried this.  The sausage and peppers was likewise delicious.  The prices are reasonable for what you get.  We went to the one in GVR, but there's the first one in Vegas downtown on 3d street.  They also have a Chicago-style place in Palace Station, and that's next on the list.  Finally: go. Go today.  Go now.  If they're not open yet, stand in line until they are.",

The server first brought out the pepperoni pizza, and said the margherita pizza was on the way out but it was about 10 minutes for the other. The pepperoni pizza was pretty good, and the margherita pizza was just good, certainly not this spectacular thing that I've heard it was, and absolutely not worth the price.  All in all, service was slow (although it was football sunday), and while the food was good it wasn't worth the price, or the drive all the way to Henderson.",

There are thousand of restaurants in Vegas, but we go to Pizza Rock, at the Green Valley Ranch location, several times to eat when we are in Vegas. We should explore the menu more, but our favorite is the Tomato Pie and an order of the meatballs. Pure excellence is all I can say. The staff is great. They're all very attentive and friendly, very helpful with the large selection of pizzas they have on the menu. They also have a large variety of beers as well. We love sitting at the bar, to the far left, and watching them make pizzas in ONE of their many woodfire pizza ovens.  I seen on Amazon that Tony Gemignani has 3 books. I added them to my wish list and can't wait to order them and try some of his dishes at home when I'm craving me some Pizza Rock back home in Wisconsin.  I think our next trip to Vegas we will switch things up and head to the original Pizza Rock location downtown to try! :-)",

    "text": "After waiting months for this place to open, our first visit was a bit anticlimactic.  We had the Mob Boss pizza and, wow...nice array of toppings but what a chunk of dough!  It seems like the pizza will be the strong suit here, but I saw other Italian entrees at other tables and they looked good and artfully prepared.    So...why do I give it three stars?  1. Uncomfortable cheap seating and tables. 2. Outdated Ed Hardy-esque douchy decor theme. 3. Music playing WAY too loud, as in you have to yell at the servers and anyone you wish to talk to at your table.  This is a cheap poorly done audio system with just a bunch of speakers set at high volume...not the way to do audio in this type of setting, they really need to consult an audio engineer and get this fixed. 4. It took over 30 minutes to get our pizza...and it was not crowded.  Hopefully #4 is temporary and a product of being new, but 1-3 May never change.  This is a real shame as GVR is my \"home\" casino and I'd really love it if a fantastic restaurant were here as we eat out every meal and I'd heavily patronize them if this were True.  As it sits I'll be lucky to talk my girlfriend into coming here again...",

Fast forward to first Monday night game of the season. Steelers Vs Redskins 4pm. We arrive at about say 3:40 I tell our hostess as she's walking us to our table we are here for Monday night football the steelers are my husbands team she completely ignores me and says is this booth ok? Yes it's fine can we get the game put on this TV ? Mumble mumble and off she goes. Waitress Rachell takes our order meatballs,zucchini fries,garlic bread and a pizza and a beer. So Rachel can we get the Football game on this TV that has baseball on and nobody but us to watch it. I'll ask shouldn't be a problem. Time goes by water arrives can we get the tv changed. I did tell her. I'll ask again. so we have been sitting for 20 minutes still watching baseball.Rachell drops off the beer it's 4pm can we move to another table we came to watch the game. She (guessing SHE is the hostess) should be by to change them. 5 minutes later meatballs are out, still baseball. We're gonna need to change tables. Waitress clearly annoyed tell me she has asked 3 times to have it changed. Allrighty then we are gonna need a new table. Waitress takes off, I pick up the meatballs in passing I run into the delightful Taylor who has evidently been given the small responsibility of changing channels. She snaps at me the game does not even start until 4:10. really? As she flounces and I mean flounces with attitude away. I set the meatballs down I thought really I'm paying to be told off by a 20 year old with a remote. Ugh. The meatballs? well not as I remembered them. the garlic bread was horrible very little garlic or cheese but a distinctive chemical or soapy taste. garlic would've been better. The pizza arrives way way to much sauce. The crust was as divine as I remembered although the bottom was a bit to charred for my liking. Zucchini fries never made it. do you still want them? No no. check please. I think this year we will be searching for a new Monday night football spot.",

We had visited the GVR location at their soft opening but only stopped in to look around.  Being a beer snob, he was salivating over the expansive selection of draft and hydro beers.    We arrived after 8pm on Saturday night and there was a 75 minute wait for a table...  just as we were thinking of leaving, 2 spots opened at the bar and we were lucky enough to grab them.  The bar staff was so friendly and quick!  Before Perry decided on what beer to order first, the server offered him a sample.  He was so happy with his choice!  We ordered a caesar salad and while we waited for the food, we enjoyed the video's from the live VJ (stationed in the MACK Truck in the dining area...  yes, it's an amazing feature!  We couldn't stop singing all the songs and watching the vintage music videos...!  That was definitely a high-lite for us!    The salad came out pretty quick for how busy the place was.  It was a big portion, super fresh with a lot of delicious parmesan and crispy croutons. Perry ordered a different beer and was super happy with his second choice.    This place is a little loud, but - hey, it's got a great vibe, good food, great beer selection and the waitstaff was super friendly and fun!  We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "So I've been to the downtown location and absolutely love it every time I go there. When they opened at GVR, I was extremely happy that they would be closer to my house and more convenient. Visited with my parents and friends on Friday night.  Menu is pretty much the same as downtown. Ordered their margherita pizza which they only make 73 of per day and it's been a winner in Naples, Italy. Has to be fantastic right? Not impressed.  We each took a slice and it was cold. Advised the waitress and she happily advised the kitchen staff and came back out to advise they were remaking it, but we had to eat it right away as it's not recommended as a to go pizza, and it's not to be eaten after it cools. Understandable, but still....we didn't wait very long the first time, maybe 5 minutes.  The second one came out and it was piping hot so we quickly grabbed slices.  IT was ok. I wasn't a fan. I didn't like the charred/burned taste throughout the crust, even though it was only partially charred which is how it's made. I mean, 900*, yes some parts will burn slightly.  I'll stick to the New Yorker, Artichoke Joe, or Cal Italia.  Service overall was lacking. We had to flag down our server multiple times, but in her defense, she had gotten a large group behind us to take care of with people ordering at all different times.  I will probably go back because I love their food.    Also, we tried Slice House in the food court, and that was a disappointment too. I think I'm just spoiled by the original location. Downtown, those slices at the window are constantly being made, served, etc, so they're fresh all the time. Here, it seemed the slices were dried out, sat out too long, not flavorful as downtown.  :(   I still love you Pizza Rock, and I know it takes time with a new location to get on your feet.",

    "text": "Stopped in on a Tuesday night. Detroit Red Top pizza was delicious, husband and I added pepperoni (which they were very generous with). Meatballs were good, but not spectacular. Only issue I had was with out server. She seemed very aloof and not attuned to what her tables needed. Maybe she was just having a bad day but it still left a sour taste in my mouth, especially since it was our first time there. She attempted to remove my child's plate without asking if he was even done (he still had food on there), and she brought our bill without asking if we were interested in dessert (we were, and we tried the mud pie). Even after ordering the dessert, she brought the bill back before even returning with the dessert. I was not impressed with the hostesses, they seemed to lack basic customer service skills, however, they were much nicer than our server. I will likely return, but will ensure that I don't sit in a section with the same server. I've saved this receipt to make sure I don't make the same mistake twice.................",

If I could eat the whole damn thing I would!!  ;) My sister and brother raved about the opening night that they got to attend and how it was just a tease because the pizza was so phenomenal and the setup was amazing and customer service and the bartenders were exceptional. They've got every kind of pizza any pizza lovers brain could think of! Some vegetarian to meat lovers, definitely pizza that I would never think of but that is absolutely delicious and mouth watering. We have been here a few times and have tasted maybe around six different kind. The names are so creative that I probably can't name all of them but.....I  do know that whatever you order you  will not disappointed!! The calamari is delicious, salads are delicious, the ranch is the beat ranch I have had in my ENTIRE life!!! (True story) service is great, atmosphere is even better. They actually play better music here than at most bars! You'll just have to try it out for yourself. PIZZA ROCK is where its at!",

To it was my second stop on restaurant week and so I do like any restaurant that participates in restaurant week. Now listen I know it was Friday night . But in my opinion that doesn't excuse the extreme wait that was happening the entire night. Now if you check my tip for the downtown pizza rock they have a similar issue, they put you on a wait when there are tables available. I really don't understand that. So why the two star rating ? Well I'll tell you and you can tell me if I'm being a little rough. The two star rating is based on the fact that the service was not only slow and terrible but our server was so rude she made me and my two girlfriends incredibly agitated. We finally did tell the manager and I have to tell you he comped our entire meal including alcohol. So did he make a right? absolutely he apologized profusely and said that is not how guests at pizza rock are treated.  And again the food? It's just great. We had the meatballs we had a ricotta pizza and we had tiramisu. And it was all good . I wish the service was better .",

When I first moved to Vegas the Pizza was not very good, now I can honestly say that we have great pizza in southern Nevada :). I was excited when I learned that Pizza rock was coming to GVR. I love the downtown las vegas location, The pizza is always a fresh, hot slice of cheesy goodness. My personal favorite is the purple potato pizza. I waited months for the GVR location to open in the food court. I stopped by last week and ordered a slice of the Grandma Pizza, a square shaped slice with a thin layer of cheese. A top the thin layer was three strips of a tomato paste like sauce with herbs sprinkled on the top. There were also very cute tear drop shaped small tomatoes on the top. The slice was fresh but not hot. The sauce was a little bland and the layer of cheese on the slice was very thin. They don't have the flavor options that the downtown location has and I don't think they are getting the turn over. The pizza looked a little dry in the display case, I will return to the downtown location, I will not return to the food court location. I might try the restaurant inside the Casino-not sure yet",

    "text": "Amazing wine selection, calamari, and the boss pizza. I came with family on Tuesday where they were finishing trivia night with sports on. Then music after was spot on, classic hip hop but edited versions. Our table was clean, great menu representations in a vinyl record album format. The wine was great. We started with calamari, half mild half spicy with two dipping sauces it was fresh and crunchy. The pizza was a lot for 4 but great for 5-6 people with 12 square slices of pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, and grape tomato sliced halves. It was one of the freshest right out from the pizza fire oven, crispy, doughy, airy and perfect balance of flavors and not salty or cheesy. It was a great find that night!",

    "text": "The food and service were fairly good.  I won't be giving it a second chance though. I am very allergic to cow milk, and asked if I could exchange fresh mozzarella with goat cheese in a salad (one of the few items I could eat without burdening the kitchen). They did, but they charged me $2 extra- for an allergy. Plus I was served maybe an ounce of cheese, which was hardly worth it for the up-charge. Lesson learned. Oh, and the waitress offered us the dessert menu (all dairy-based) and seemed annoyed when I declined.  This place is great if you have no allergies. They seem unable to work around simple substitutions without making you pay extra for it. Shame because my companion liked his Stromboli so I probably would have given it another go. Oh well.",

    "text": "The draw of Pizza Rock for me continues to be the wide selection of pizzas and beers. If you want to get away from your usual go-to pizzas and want to try something new, Pizza Rock is the best place to go. And for us, it's just a hop, skip, and a jump away. This is also a good place to play the beer pairing with the pizza game. If you find a winner, it makes your meal that much more enjoyable.  My wife and I came at the end of March looking to use our $15 monthly Station coupon before it expired. Beware, there is a $50 minimum to use the coupon, but oh well, I guess that meant more food to try. There was no wait for a table at 8:30 on a Wednesday night. We started with the beer battered artichokes ($9), my wife had her usual linguine and clams ($18) and I ordered the Old Chicago ($23).  The beer batter on our appetizer was light and didn't overwhelm the artichoke and the horseradish aioli provided a little bit of a kick. I thought the Chicago cracker thin pizza was great. The saltiness of the cheeses and meats was balanced by the sweetness of the ricotta on the pizza and the roasted, chocolaty flavor of my Deschutes Black Butte porter ($7). The only problem was that I ordered my beer when the pizza first arrived and didn't get it until I was stuffing my face with the third piece of pizza. Someone dropped the ball there because neither the bar nor the server were overly busy.  The consistently slow service on every visit that we've had is our only gripe. The pizza and beer will always have me coming back and Pizza Rock is quickly shooting up the leader board. We haven't been disappointed by any of the pies yet and there are still many more yet to try.",

It can be freaking unicorn magical.   I Have this weird theory of trying the special or suggestions or everything when I go places new. It's like I'm afraid I'll never be back and if that is the case I need to experience it wholly.   I debated over appetizers then just asked our server her suggestion. Calamari. Hmm well that wasn't on my debated list, but if the lady says it's awesome, I'm going to try it. I like calamari, don't get me wrong, it's just taste to find GOOD calamari. But.. When in Rome... Or Henderson. Calamari it is.  Good choice. The sauces they give you are fantastic and you can get it spicy. Oh yes. You are speaking my language. Spicy it is. And this was probably in the top two if not the top squid I've ever had. I feel this will be a great meal.  They have a fantastic beer list too. I don't remember what I got but it was different and deliciously refreshing.   Pizza ordered. An all meat one which I can't remember the name, and the Guinness sausage pizza. I loved that Guinness pizza so much I would marry it. Yep. . It's freaking awesome. It's different enough to be interesting and delicious enough to not regret ordering it. (You know what I'm talking about... Pulled pork pancakes..epic mistake) the crust is freaking fabulous. I would eat just their crust if they made it. The pizza is high quality ingredients and I love their thorough explanation of the flour and temps for each type of pizza.   Honestly? I can't wait to go back. I'm sure you are wondering what the neck I'm doing with 4 stars instead of 5.. Well it's pretty expensive for pizza. I realize ingredients cost money do you are getting much better meats, cheeses, well everything compared to pizza hut, but our lunch was almost a hundred dollars and that wasn't much to go.   I do highly recommend it if you want to splurge. It's damn delicious and I might apply for a job just to get the perks.",

Nice crispy, not doughy bottom, g8 sauce, deeelish stringy cheese.     Can't wait to go to the actual restaurant also located inside Green Valley Casino, sit outside, enjoy one of Tony's Award Winning Pies with a glass of wine  Sounds like a G8 way to start the weekend",

    "text": "I'm a fan of the downtown Pizza Rock but was let down by Tony's slice counter on site here at GVR. I finally gave the sit-down restaurant a try when friends set up a happy hour visit, and was pleasantly surprised. Note that there are some dishes that are only available at the downtown location (no salted dough burrata app here!) but the pizza menu seems to be the same.  HH is 3-6PM and then again after 10PM, featuring $5 and $7 personal pizzas (single-topping, Cal Italia, Pesto Paradise, and Tony Two Times), as well as a handful of apps. Our group tried just about everything offered and overall the quality was very good for the under-$20 average we paid and everyone left full.  The Tony Two Times pizza was my preference, loaded up with meats, while the Cal Italia I shared with Chris V had a huge crust-to-pie ratio that seemed inconsistent across the table and took away from the otherwise quite appealing sweet and savory flavor combo. The classic meatballs are always a hit (and at 3/$4, everyone can have their own order!), but the zucchini fries (with Calabrese ranch) and soppresata sliders (with tasty garlic fries but lackluster bread) were just okay.   Our server Paige was super sweet and more than accommodating for our large group with complicated orders, split checks, and last-minute additions (both to our orders and our party). She's a gem. Looking forward to coming back for the New Yorker pizza and the burrata burger!  TIP: As soon as you're seated, locate a bottle of Tony's Hot Pepper Oil. Dip your crust in it. Spicy deliciousness!",

It was our first time, and it was quite busy with only one server one, felt bad for the guy, especially since there was no management on the floor helping him greet new tables or attend to current ones. I do commend our server for briefly advising that he be over shortly, that way the guest feels acknowledged. However, when ordering, our server didn't even ask us if we wanted the personal size pizza or regular....So when my boyfriend's pizza came out, it was entirely small. All we could think was $20 for this? We later found out ot was only $7, but my boyfriend received an extremely small pizza, in which in them had to take slices from my regular sized one, which kind of ruined our experience. Also, the personal pizza was almost 50% crust, so it wasn't very filling, especially for a 260lb man. It was a one-bite pizza. Loved the pizza crust though. The mud pie was delicious although the crust was a nuisance to get through.",

    "text": "I'm almost certain that this would've been a full 5 stars with full-sized pizzas. Based on this visit, there's room for improvement.  Pizza Rock has garnered rave reviews ever since its inception in Downtown Las Vegas four years ago, and I've slacked heavily on making a visit to the more convenient (for Henderson residents like me) and accessible (because Downtown parking sucks) location at Green Valley Ranch, which has been open since 2015. I don't even have a review of Pizza Rock because my only real visit was at a Yelp Elite Event last year (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/yee-greed-at-the-mob-museum-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/yee-greed-a...</a>). In short, this visit was way overdue.  I met up with Yelp friends for aforementioned happy hour, which is 3-6pm and 10pm-close nightly. We did a 5:30pm visit, although I had to slip in a little late due to an unexpected work call. Huge shoutout to Christie L. and Stefany V. for looking out and ordering before 6:00 for me! I wish I'd properly located the Paseo Verde garage or at least the valet escalator, given that Pizza Rock is on that side of the casino, but I parked at the nearest edge of the District instead and took the movie theater entrance and escalator.  I didn't even plumb the depths of the happy hour variety due to my rushed circumstances, but the Pizza Rock meatballs ($4 happy hour pricing, 3 pieces) are as fantastic as I'd recalled. Huge hunks of properly seasoned and moist ground meat with an unparalleled tomato sauce were delicious hot and even remained enjoyable at room temp. I also sampled the Zucchini Fries ($5 HH), which are pretty good and come with an addictive Calabrese ranch sauce. A photo of the full portion leaves a bit to be desired though, even at happy hour. Also, I wish that I'd checked my review which I'd linked above and ordered the fried green beans, another happy hour app, but I suppose that can wait until next time.  Personal size pizzas are $7 at happy hour, and I managed to have at least a slice of each. The award-winning Cal Italia was the most impressive, with prosciutto, sweet fig preserve, and balsamic reduction standing out above a bed of cheeses. The Tony 2 Times was quite a good meat lover's pie, but didn't have the variety of cheeses and accompaniments that their standard menu New Yorker does. The Pesto Paradise was a simple but very effective vegetarian option.  My issue with these happy hour specialties was the uncomfortably high crust-to-middle ratio, especially on the Cal Italia. Imagine a full-size pizza and visualize shrinking the diameter of the topping-filled area to something more like 6 inches while keeping the same width of crust. It's inevitably disappointing, even if the crust is as fantastically crispy as theirs. The serendipitous consolation was that I had makeshift breadsticks for the leftover meatball sauce, but you simply don't buy pizza just for just the dough.  I didn't get any dessert myself, but I tasted a bite of the Mud Pie ($9) of a generous visiting elite from New York named Tom. This dessert is gargantuan and might be enough for even three of me to share. The Oreo cookie crust is a bit tough to break even with metal spoons but crunches awesomely, and the coffee and vanilla ice creams along with the fudge and caramel sauces make this a rich craving-satisfier type of dessert.  The restaurant was crowded, but it wasn't too loud for standard conversational volume even with TVs showing Monday Night Football and playoff baseball. I also appreciated the server's willingness to split checks item-by-item. No observation from me on the speed of service because I kinda fast-forwarded through that.  I'm glad that I finally got the opportunity to review a Pizza Rock. Now it's just a matter of making sure that I visit more than once a year and using those opportunities to try their real pizzas. Anyone here wanna join me?",

    "text": "Based solely off of the food, this place is a 5 but because of slightly slow service on a slow night, a disappointing cocktail, and high prices, this place gets a 4 which is still really good and definitely deserving of a visit from everyone.  We went here for my friend's birthday and were glad we did!  The four of us each got a cocktail, all of which were a bit disappointing to be honest, three appetizers, all fantastic, and a pizza, also fantastic.  They also surprised us with a free dessert for my friend's birthday!    For our appetizers we got the rosemary garlic fries (great), the calamari (half spicy, half regular) (fantastic, also, the yellow spicy sauce was out of this world), and the coccoli which is fried bread with burrata cheese and prosciutto (great).  For dinner we got the Giant Sicilian Fratellanza which came on focaccia and was topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella, oregano, mushrooms, Italian sausage, pepperoni, and genoa salami (fantastic).  They then surprised us with a free dessert which some of my party liked and some didn't.  It was lady fingers with some thick cream and other stuff.  Not sure what it was entirely but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  The restaurant is quite appealing to the eyes yet it is quite loud and quite expensive which area bit of a turn off.  I always say I will pay for good food but this was pushing the boundaries a little bit.  That being said, it was so good I will definitely be back.  We also had to wait quite a while for the check but it was fine as we were all having a good time chatting.",

    "text": "I honestly would have never tried Pizza Rock if not for circumstance. We found ourselves wandering around Green Valley Ranch on Thanksgiving looking for a place to eat. Pizza Rock had no wait at all so that's how it was chosen.   We were soon greeted by our server. \"First time in?\" He asked. I nodded. \"Great! Welcome in!\" he said. I was expecting him to tell us about the menu, recommend items, something along those lines, but he didn't. He left us to review the menu.  There were a lot of different menu items.   We finally settled on two dishes to share, the garden salad and the tomato pie.   The garden salad came out and the portion size was rather disappointing. There wasn't much to it, fresh greens, cherry tomatoes, onions, mozzarella cheese, tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette. The salad itself was fresh and flavorful, it was the portion that was underwhelming despite having ordered the sharing size.   The tomato pie came out shortly after and was full of flavor. The tomato pie consisted of Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Garlic, Fresh Basil, extra virgin olive oil and romano. The pizza was perfect, not overly greasy, crispy at the crust. The basil and the garlic complimented each other well.   For what it was, it was a bit pricey in my opinion. The salad came in at $11 and the tomato pie came in at $21. The portions were barely enough to feed two people. The good news was we left with room for dessert.   I can add this to the list of places I've tried though I don't think I would go back.",

The crust was almost nonexistent on the bottom. It should have been labeled as a sauce only pizza. There was very little cheese and maybe 3 small pieces of basil.   My husband ordered the Italian Trio Sub which looked delicious but was tasteless. With all the ingredients you'd have thought it would be flavorful. Needless to say, we left hungry and most likely will not be returning.   The noise level is also annoying as it is very loud. It seems all the tables are in direct line with every speaker.",

It was very good and not too sweet. We ordered pizzas for the table and I was able to sample the Old Chicago which was sausage, meatballs, and ricotta dollops on a cracker thin crust. Really good pizza and loaded with toppings. Also had a slice of the River City Ranch which had chicken, bacon, tomatoes, scallions and ranch drizzled on it. This pizza was also really good and loaded with toppings and of course who doesn't love ranch?   We also ordered the meatball sub. Pizza Rock has really good meatballs and on past visits I have ordered the meatball appetizer for a meal. The sandwich was served with rosemary garlic fries which were so delish! I think I found a new craving. Crispy fries tossed with rosemary and fresh garlic bits.   Really good food, great service, and a laid back casual atmosphere. I'll be back. I see myself craving those rosemary fries probably on a weekly basis.",

Mostaccioli was the first thing that caught my eye. I love mostaccioli since my teenage years when I dated an Chicago Italian. It was good but the mostaccioli pasta was a bit larger in diameter  and was even elbow in some cases. I enjoyed it, but was no where near Grandma Onofrio's  Now, the purpose of the visit- the Pie! When was a small wee child in Las Vegas, there was the pizzeria located on East Charleston near Bruce named the Pizza Palace. This was so incredible, that all pies, from here on out, will be judged by this high bar.  This is place can do pies New York, Chicago, Detroit whatever. I have been here twice and I have ordered The New Yorker. Sliced mozzarella, tomato sauce, sliced house link sausage, garlic, pepperoni, ricotta. RICOTTA!!! OMG the Ricotta. So rich. you may want to ask your server to go easy on the Ricotta, but damn! Before you leave this Earth.....try the New Yorker.  The place is raucous. I took my mother here. Great pie, not sure if it is great for my 75 year old mom. She is not dowdy, she has been to 10 Rush concerts, but still, the noise level is a little below yelling level. IF you want a good pie and a great atmosphere to people watch go here. If you want a good pie, but a little more low key, this is not it.",

I'm not sure if I can get totally behind the atmosphere, it seems a little too \"Guy Fiere (Fieri? Fierie?)\" for me, but I get what they are going for.  I'm not familiar with the chef that started this but apparently he won some sort of cooking show. Honestly, I came here for the beer selection when we first moved to the area, as it is close, has a good local tap selection, good rotating list of beers, and the servers (so far) have actually been able to describe a beer without saying \"It's kind of like a Blue Moon.\" Why does everyone say that when they don't know how to describe a beer? I digress...I think I was most impressed when they had bottles of KBS and weren't charging $12 a piece like they would in the MidWest. I have to say, the pizza is pretty good too, a little heavy on the olive oil but that's just a minor complaint. Three stars just for the beer selection, give 'em one star for the food and overall it's wort a visit.",

There was a good amount of people here for dinner, but it wasn't ridiculously packed.  Loud atmosphere.  I felt like I had to use my outside voice, but I didn't care because that's my normal voice anyway.    There were TVs everywhere airing sports when we first arrived at 6pm.  Then later in the night they were playing music videos.  Since this place is called \"Pizza Rock,\" I thought they would play rock music, but they were playing a variety of music instead (which is awesome).  They played everything from pop 60s - today, hip hop, and R&B.  Fun to listen to and watch on screen.    On to the food:appetizers were meatballs, gorgonzola fries, and clams in wine and butter sauce.   The meatballs come in (I think) 6 big pieces in marinara sauce.  They're big enough to share 1 with another person.  Marina sauce was good.    Gorgonzola fries: parmesan cheese, blue cheese, and garlic.  I love how there were chunks of blue cheese on these fries!  Super addicting...I ate this with a quickness.    Pizza: I like how they have every variety of pizza from deep dish to thin crust.  I got the Michigan, which is a thin crust pizza with pepperoni.  I thought it was a little bit on the salty side, but not too bad.  Came in this huge portion shareable for 6 people.    This is a great place for groups.  Just make sure you make a reservation.",

Once I complained about the first pizza not having what I asked for Eric's service went from bad to worse. No one came around to check on the second pizza so I sat there with a pizza I didn't want and then got charged $41.00 for crappy food and bad service. Way to go Pizza Rock!

The crust was soggy yet tasted burnt and the salad was dry and has very little dressing on it. The service was good which is why they get 3 stars. The restaurant and atmosphere is nice. But the margarita pizza was just not good. I was hoping this would become a go to for us since we live close by.",

I love the fact that their menu offers so many different types of pizza to suit any pizza lovers dream. My only experience at GVR has been sitting at the bar to eat. The bartenders are very friendly, excellent at making drinks, and deliver prompt service. My only complaint is it was loud on both occasions I visited. One particular night they had a trivia night that made it difficult to converse with friends I haven't seen in a while. Instead of using only a portion of the restaurant for trivia night the host was on the microphone blasting the entire restaurant regardless of who was or was not participating. I recommend they section off a Portion of the restaurant for those who want to engage in trivia.",

We ventured over a couple hours before the 4th of July fireworks. There was a decent wait for a table which was to be expected, but the bar had two spots right away. Dining at the bar was enjoyable, seats were spaced enough that it didn't feel cramped and the bartenders gave us great service.  I had the pomegranate serrano margarita which was mostly hot and just a little sweet. If you like serious heat then this drink is for you. For an appetizer my husband I shared the fried tomato caprese salad. The idea of frying the tomatoes made it a little unique and the cheese tasted really fresh. All of the flavors went well together. For our meal we shared the St. Anthony pizza which was both unique and delicious. It had large slices of sausage, the right amount of egg and the perfect amount of ricotta. We loved the combination. I didn't even have room for dessert which may be a first.",

We ordered zucchini fries, the meatballs, and 2 personal pizzas- the two times Tony's and Pesto Paradise. The zucchini fries were crispy and savory but the dipping sauce that came with them is what sold me. It was hot and creamy, kinda like a sriracha mayo. SO GOOD! Definitely gave Carl's Jr.'s zucchini fries a run for their money! And they were like $5! The meatballs were bomb. The sauce was so thick it just sat wherever you dropped it. Loved it! Those were seriously like $3 for 3 meatballs. It was stupid cheap. The personal pizzas were $7. I only tried the Pesto Paradise but it was so good! It was think crust with cherry tomatoes, pesto, garlic and cheese. It totally hit the spot. We only ate like half our pizzas and then brought the rest home. Tons of food for a great price.   PRO TIP- if you go to Green Valley Ranch casino from the shopping mall side you can get here pretty easily without having to walk through the entire casino if you hate smelling like cigarettes (like me!)",

We got a classic peperoni sicilian fucking bad man tomatoe sauce was like candy very sweet like i was eating sugar on a loaf of bread they sure it wasnt chicago thick crust on that? the peperoni not edible not sure what they get for it but i could taste nothing from it they were crisp yes thats good but nontaste i tasted nothing. The cheese was bland as well.   fucking disgrace.   Now the Chicago thin crust they gave us there was no taste of sauce what so ever like really? nothing cheese was oily and just fucked man It tasted tainted and wierd man. The sausage on it tasteless the crust was a disgrace the corn meal on the crust was the only tastey thing. I dont know how they been open for so long but might be the beer if your drunk or hungry you may eat here. the service was nice the decor nice food fucking wretched.  Not coming back",

    "text": "I've finally gotten the chance to eat here and while their pizza is more expensive, they have a lot of variety and the quality of their toppings is higher than your local delivery store.  Our service was great, as our waitress took the time to explain all the pizzas on the menu as well as make some recommendations. Water was kept full constantly, though we didn't have enough setups, which are stored in little pails on the table. We just grabbed some, which is probably what happened to ours.  We started with the house salad which had cherry tomatoes, mixed greens, mozzarella, and a few other items all tossed in a cherry vinaigrette. It was quite tasty, but \"family\" portion was a little smaller than I would hope for. It's probably good for 2-3 people, but a little meager for 4, depending on how much salad you actually want.  The pizza we tried was called the Mob Boss, a Sicilian with pretty much every topping you might think of on a normal pizza. Olives, onions, peppers, meats galore, and more. At 32 dollars, it's not a cheap pizza, but it was enough to feed four of us easily. The focaccia-style crust is light but thick and puffy. I really enjoy focaccia personally, though I can see others not loving it. It's served in a sheet pan and I highly recommend it to those who like pan or deep dish pizzas. I ate 3.5 slices, which left me very full (probably over ate), and I enjoyed every bite.  Honestly, the only pizza that they don't have that I can think of is a thick Chicago-style deep dish with sauce on top. Giordano's is probably the best option in town for that one.  They have a very interesting happy hour menu, which we will likely come back for that includes $7 personal pizzas that actually have a good number of toppings and such.",

The waitress then charged me .50 cents for a small ranch.  So stupid what a way to not get a good tip.  Then the other day I thought I would try again since they advertise that on Wed. Seniors get 15% off.  When Gino our waiter brought us the bill I said that he didn't apply the discount he said that they don't give it on appitizers.  I said that the sign at the hostess station clearly states 15% off for seniors on  Wed. and nothing stipulating what was included or not.  Well he really gave me a mouth full of rude reasons why .  I asked him to simply go and read the sign at the hostess station, but he did not budge.  It would be so refreshing if the manager or owner of this place could teach the employees some Customer Service.  Very lacking.  We will never be returning.",

I'm not usually a person who likes a lot of sauce on my pizza. It always seems to take away from the cheese. But this sauce was sweet and so fresh tasting. It went perfectly with the cheeses on the pizza. There were little dollops of ricotta and every bite that had ricotta mixed with the sauce tasted like a little bite of lasagna heaven. The crust was crunchy but soft. Perfect amount of meat on top. Delicious pizza.",

Anyone can look right here on Yelp and see that whatever change was made recently has led to A LOT of 1 star reviews, many from locals who have eaten there many times.  Pizza Rock needs to fire or undo whatever change was made, and make it right with the people who have been screwed over from terrible customer service lately.  If you screw something up at a restaurant, make it right. I ordered last night and it was wrong. It would have been a simple fix, but they just refused. I was basically flabbergasted. I've never had a restaurant just refuse to make something right, especially when it was so, so simple to fix.  Sorry, but if you're paying $28 for a stupid pizza, it had better darn-well be correct.  Stop acting like a bunch of prima-donnas...you guys make pizza for a living, you're not saving the world.",

    "text": "So this review is for the happy hour. Not sure how much of a difference there is between happy hour and the regular menu. But I just wanted to be clear that we went during the late night happy hour.  When we got here it was relatively slow. About two more tables besides ourselves and about three people at the bar. Out of all the places inside Greenvalley this has to be the best choice for late night happy hour.  I started off with the zucchini sticks for five dollars. Not a bad price for the amount of zucchini that you get. Typical breaded and fried but these had a nice fresh crisp flavor. Well worth the five dollars. I gave this a solid 5/5.  Next up was the pizza. I got the Tony two times. For seven dollars this is absolutely the best way to go. Personal size pizza with pepperoni mushrooms and twice the sausage. They have a couple of other choices for seven dollars which you can't beat.  Overall a pretty decent happy hour menu. You'll be sure to find something for everyone. Drink specials are pretty decent. The happy hour menu ranges from four dollars to about seven dollars.",

Having once lived in NH, it looked like a great choice.  Wrong.  You could not pawn this off as Tomato Pie in NH unless you served free beer.  Not only that but, you served us cold pizza, twice.  We sent the pie back after one bite as the sauce was room temp at best.  The second pie was delivered with a warning, \"careful, this is hot\".  The waitress was right, the pan was hot, the sauce was room temp.  Why do you advertise pizza cooked in a 700 degree oven if you are going to serve it cold.  Must be a disconnect between the kitchen and wait staff.  Which brings me to my last point.  The service is slow and this was Tuesday night.  If you want a pizza slice at Green Valley, head to Tony's Slice house in the the food court.",

They had soppressata on the menu I was sold! However, once we got there - completely different story. If you're looking for a good Napoletana pizza before 5:00pm, forget it.  If you want to make a substitution, forget it. Pizza is a very personal taste, that's why usually you can order varying items on your pizza, to make it yours. Not here. It's a \"craft\" and apparently they know my taste buds better than I know them. Some items specifically state that no substitutions are allowed; which, implies that if you're ordering an item not specifically marked with \"no substitutions\", you'd be able to substitute a topping for something you may like more. Not the case. If you want to personalize your pizza, go somewhere else.  All this really boils down to customer service. I feel like Pizza Rock has the philosophy that the customer really doesn't know what's best for them and it is their job to enlighten the customer. I'm sure you've heard of Seinfeld's \"soup nazi\" -- Pizza Rock epitomizes that \"character\".",

Not a bad deal but if one ever wants to try a pie from New York, Detroit, Chicago, Sicily, or Neapolitan at one restaurant the head over to Pizza Rock. We opted for a New York pepperoni and a Neapolitan \"fancy\" pizza and both were great. We happened to eat around happy hour and took advantage of half price apps of calamari, pan-fried green beans, and truffle french fries. Food was really good, but they do have more options then pizza and next time I visit Green Valley I may order me some Sausages and Peppers.",

He is always very pleasant and gives great recommendations on beer. He is very courteous and attentive no matter how busy they are. Pizza Rock has great meatballs and sauce. They have a great variety of pizzas to choose from. They also have happy hour everyday from 4-6pm. I was surprised they had happy hour on NYE.  So bonus for us! We highly recommend this place when you want good pizza and great service! Ask for Brandt when you go :)",

About 10 minutes later (he was 2 slices in) I got bartenders attention and asked her where my food was. She was gonna about 4-6 minutes and came back with a huge puffy awesome looking calzone. .... until you separated the 2 pieces and realized there was NOtHING inside!! On the bottom was a few pieces of cheese and spinach and the rest was air. There was a tiny container of sauce on the side. 1 bite in and I realized the dough was raw. Got bartenders attention and showed her. She took it away, no offer for anything else (my guy was almost done with his pizza at this Point) and came back to tell us she took it off bill. That was it. No manager visit, no offer for a salad or other entree. We left there and I stopped at food court on way out to get a sandwich. Horrible experience start to finish!",

They currently have a Monday special where if you bring your mother they eat for free (an entree up to $20). I brought my mom and she had a salad (all of their salads are entree sized and could feed a family) and I ordered their famed Margherita pizza.  The pizza crust was soaked in the juices if the tomatoes and was limp and drippy. I had asked the waitress if we qualified for the Monday promotion, and she had said we did; however, she returned and told us that we both needed to have ordered a pizza or pasta :/  Update: The owner, Trevor, reached out to me about my experience. I greatly appreciate that he takes pride in his business and the experiences of his guests. I'm going to give it another shot (because everyone has a bad day every now and again).",

Service here is friendly but slow. We ordered the Gorgonzola fries as an appetizer. I've had  these several times at the downtown location. They were good but they weren't as \"cheesy melty\" for lack of a better term as the fries I've ordered downtown. We ordered the New Yorker Pizza. It was okay. Not piping hot as I'm used to. The toppings were great but the pizza overall was hard to chew. We ended up eating the toppings and leaving the crust.",

She had suggested we go there if we wanted to grab a late dinner.  So we did and the first thing that caught our attention was the smell of pizza and the music playing from this place.  Immediately, we wanted to eat pizza!  We happened to stop in during their late night happy hour so each of the items we ordered were under $8.  The meatballs were good...nothing special about them.  But the Rosemary Garlic Fries...OMG!  Those were so darn delicious!  I'm craving them right now!  You definitely can taste the rosemary.  They were so crispy and hot out the fryer.  My favorite item that night.  The personal pan pizzas (Cal Italia and Tony 2 Times) were also very delish.  Now to the Hot Pepper Olive Oil....AMAZEBALLS!  I love me some spice and the oil added a nice kick to the food.  Especially when we drizzled some onto the Rosemary Garlic Fries.  Made the fries even better.    I believe there is more than one location in Las Vegas.  If you're ever there please give this place a try.  I really enjoyed the food.  The atmosphere is pretty rock n roll-ish.  But that made our late night dinner even more enjoyable.",

Forgot my daughters meal so have deal with a five year old constantly asking when her food is coming. Never apologize for that either. seems like natural for her to forget costumers order. & when I pay I paid with gift card & debit, I work in the same industry so I know that she authorized my card for the full amount coz My bank put a hold authorization for the full amount instead of partial bec. I also gave her a gift card so it took 5 days for my bank to release the money for a mistake authorization. FYI I understand mistakes happened but if you could at least let us know if you made a mistake it will be nice.",

Second time I came here, I had a coupon, and the pizza was 10 times better, but I ultimately wouldn't say it's the best pizza place in Vegas. I'd stick with Grimaldi's or even Bella Vita in the District. It's good for the price, but nothing more. Just an a-ok pizza place in GVR.  The one True complaint I have with this place is the live music. One night I was there they had a Dj, which I normally don't mind DJs, but the music that night was ear-piercingly loud. Also, for an Italian place, that guy was playing some very unfitting music. Lots of rap and latin music from what I remember.  It's definitely worth a try, though. You might like it, I just thought it was alright.",

We also tried the 1/2 & 1/2 calamari app and it was really good as well...however, the dipping sauce for the spicy calamari is REALLY hot, so beware.  The service was adequate, but not great.

Also the price was outrageous for what you get. Ended up being closer to 30 bucks with tax for one pizza. Grimaldis, Settebello, way better options under same price point. 2/5",

    "text": "VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  Who the hell is Tony Gemignani? I'm ashamed that I had to google him. I learned that this dude is THE KING OF PIZZA, the first American and non-Neopolitan to win the World Championship of Pizza.  Knowing none of this, I lunched here on 7/20/16. The Green Valley Ranch location, with blaring rock music, is a pleasant space with a gastropub vibe. Tables are not situated too close together.It's an environment conducive to fun. The restaurant also has great Happy Hour promotions which include both pizzas and drinks.  Pizza Rock is the most ambitious pizza restaurant that I'm aware of. None of this \"shorten the menu\" Gordon Ramsey stuff. Pizza Rock's menu reads more like an encyclopedia, where one can get numerous selections based on Italian, Californian, Chicago or New York styles. The menu even specifies the oven temperature for cooking each variety of pizza. That is attention to detail, man....or woman.  Rena, my server, greeted me politely and gave me several minutes to peruse the voluminous menu. It took some time because, in addition to the staggering variety of pizza options, the craft beer menu included more than twenty selections.I chose a New Belgium Golden Ale. It was cold, fresh, complex and absolutely delicious.  Pizza was a difficult choice. I settled on the Margherita Pie. As per the menu, this pie won the World Championship.Humorously, Pizza Rock only makes 73 of these pies a day. Why not 75, 80 or 100? Tony, obviously, does not like round numbers. Anyway, since I arrived when the restaurant opened at 11, I know I got the first one of the day. Oh boy! I'm glad I chose this pie.  The Pie was cooked perfectly. The mozzarella was extremely fresh and distinct tasting. It was amazingly delicious.The crust was crisp on the bottom, light and tantalizingly  \"puffy\"........think the Jerry Seinfeld Shirt Episode. I'm not one who generally notices the crust, but this crust was outstanding.The pie was also sauced in perfect proportion. This pie was the best Margherita Pie I have ever tasted. Indeed, it was not only the best dish I tasted in Vegas, but on the short list of the best dishes I have eaten all year. I polished off all six slices in no time at all.  Based on the foregoing, I have, for the first time, placed the word \"very\" before \"highly recommended\".  Tony.....PLEASE, PLEASE bring Pizza Rock to lower New York!!!!",

I might as well go order the next size up in jeans because I can now have my pizza and eat it too!!   Food here as always was excellent!!  The happy hour menu has enough food selections to keep your palate singing!!

Really a shame Pizza Rock doesn't put enough toppings on there. How can a pizza place be concerned with sausage and topping food costs when they are charging such high prices for pizza?  Get it together Pizza Rock! Your blowing it!  Worst reputation to have is to be  cheap when you are trying to deliver a superior product at premium prices. There were 8 tiny bits of sausage on my thin crust sausage pizza, I felt like i had been robbed by a sausage bandit.  If the sausage prices are high because your importing from Chicago, switch to something else! Jimmy Dean makes great sausage just add some fennel, red pepper flakes,  and a little oregano- BOOM! italian sausage :) Load it up don't be so skimpy your profit margins are huge on these pizzas, people know what your doing!!!.  You guys got everything else figured out get it together! You could have the best pizza in Green Valley Ranch be smart and add an appropriate level of sausage. As a general rule of thumb when adding sausage to a pizza there should no more than a 3/4 inch between each piece of sausage.  Also remember as sausage cooks its reduces in size by up to 75%.  I will be ordering again soon I hope this issue is taken seriously and is rectified because i don't want there to be any more victims of the sausage bandit.",

Top it of with a Mexican Coke.  If you go, request Nick.  He is always attentive even with how busy the restaurant was.  He got our pizza out extremely quick.  Definitely should check it out if you are at GVR or nearby.",

We got the veggie and the cal itialia. Really great food. They should re think their demographic. Lots of older locals in the area. Not in the mood to feel their body vibrate while trying to have a conversation over great pizza. Could wait to scarf down the pie and get relief from the vibrating noise.",

She was so warm, welcoming, and fun!  She is such a comedian!!! We will return because of her.  Thank you so much Pizza Rock for a fun night out.",

    "text": "On the recommendation of a very reliable Yelp friend, we decided to try this place, located inside the Green Valley Casino. We were definitely not disappointed! We arrived about eleven pm, it was not very busy, being a Wednesday night, but there was a lively feel to the dining and our server was very helpful and informative as she described the three types of pizzas and the ovens that they used to create the variations to the crusts. We decided to try the gorgonzola fries and the \"Old Chicago\"  pizza. The fries came to the table within just a couple minutes, they were very tasty, although I am not a huge fan of Bleu cheese and I  think they garnish the fries with Bleu cheese crumbles. The gorgonzola cheese is kinda like a sauce, certainly not bad, and the fries were cooked perfectly. Next time I will try the Rosemary &  Garlic fries. The pizza arrived at our table very quickly and was cooked to perfection, black on the edges, the thin crust on this pizza is awesome (if you like thin crust pizza) and generously covered with delicious toppings including tomato sauce, mozzarella, provolone, garlic Italian fennel sausage sliced meatballs, ricotta and oregano. The 16\" pie cost $23.00. We took at least half of it home and I am sure it will be great tomorrow for leftovers. We highly recommend this restaurant. And our server was very helpful and attentive!",

Paige was our server for the night and was completely attentive to all of our needs, and though it was super busy she didn't seem flustered or panicked. We ordered a Cal Italia, Gorgonzola Fries, Calamari, a Molinari and a few other things. The food came out hot and when I say that the Cal Italia and Calamari were the best I've ever had, that doesn't even do it justice! Tommy, one of the managers came to our table and talked with us several times throughout the night. The way that he interacts with customers is the way every business should. I'm sure that we've all experienced going to a restaurant and regretting that you chose to spend your money there, whether it was the service, food or atmosphere. This isn't one of those places. You come in happy and leave even happier. I am now a regular here. By far my favorite pizza place!",

I look forward to trying a lot more from this very extensive menu!!! The music was a little loud for maybe an older crowd?

Apparently the parking garage is THE place to park (we didn't know).  It was pretty busy and loud, but we had a reservation and we were seated immediately. I was immediately impressed by the beer list. Then the food menu- it's large and there's something for everybody. All kinds of different pizzas with different types of crusts and toppings. Salads. Pastas. Calzones. Burgers.  Service itself was pretty good (no one was ever without a beer), but the food took a long time to come out. Also, everyone's food arrived at different times. My pizza came out 10 minutes before the next person got their food and then another 10 minutes after that everyone else got their food. Not wanting to be rude, I waited for everyone to receive their food before I started eating. My pizza was cold by then, but it was still good. I got the Chicago Frank Nitti. It was more than enough for 2 people! The portions are huge here! We all took boxes home!",

It tasted like spaghetti sauce and way too sweet. Gave it a try. Disappointed. Grimalti's is much better. That's just my opinion and taste. But I know good pizza.",

Being an old Jersey girl, I know my pizza.  If you want to get shot in NY .... take this pizza to NYC and try to serve it to someone.   The worst thing was that we saw other people ordering  the same pizza and it looked nothing like the burnt cracker with cheese so over done it no longer resemble cheese  (is these a secret to ordering here?)  I get the whole 700 degree oven business that's gonna char the crust - but this was inedible.  The bartender - bless her soul,  took it away and we decided to try something else.  We both got the meatball parm sandwiches which were very good.   So will we be back? - maybe....but I'm not ordering pizza.  What a shame.",

Fried artichoke heart was good but didn't need the dipping sauce at all, it was overpowering the artichoke flavor. I just squeezed a little lemon and it was much nicer than the accompanying horseradish aioli. Mud pie dessert was ok, but only about half the size of the amazing Mud pie being served at Born And Raised (and the ice cream wasn't nearly as rich as BAR's either). Service was the real low light here for us. Slow and forgetful. I would like to try more different pizza varieties, so I'll be back for the good food. Hopefully the service is a bit better.",

The waitresses were somewhat busy but definitely did not look happy to be working.  I came here twice during my stay at GVR.  The location is great.  Doesn't get much better than in a casino. They have late night happy hour which is awesome. Too bad they don't sell any pizza by the slice after a certain time. $5 for a personal pizza which is of decent size isn't a bad alternative. $7 for a specialty personal pizza was a little high given the minimal toppings they add. The  truffle fries had good flavor but they were a little soggy.  The menu said $3 but got charged $4.  Not complaining but found that somewhat odd.  Paid it anyways.  The garlic bread was good.  I ordered that my 2nd time visiting pizza rock.  I could've tried it my 1st visit because they messed up and accidently brought a garlic bread to my table.  I notified them as I didn't want to take someones order and they took it back and probably tossed it instead of offering it to me.  It sat at my table for a good 10 minutes as it took that long to find someone to notify of the mistake.  Oh well guess that's the way they handle those situations.   Would probably go back if I stay at GVR again due to the convenience of being located in a casino.",

With a variety of different style pizzas and a several different pizza ovens each is a True work of art. I recommend ordering two or three of the different award winners to truly understand the artistry. The Margherita was the defining World Cup Winner - fresh tomato, just the right amount of fresh mozzarella on the perfect crust giving it a delicate old world flavor. You will understand why it won and you'll still be thinking about this pizza weeks later - I have the texts from friends to prove it! This pizza is also great with Pepperoni added. We just asked Nick who has been there since day 1, he is an absolute house expert waiter on the nuances of each pizza - he'll set you up right! For a second pizza I recommend the Cal Italia or the New Yorker - if you have a big enough group snag all three. The Cal Italia is a Food Network Winner and completely different pizza from crust to cheese you'll be glad you tried it.  Finally the New Yorker, local winner of best traditional pizza will have you smiling when you reach the dollop of ricotta. If you are visiting, definitely worth grabbing a ride to visit this Henderson treasure if you want to experience pizza you will still be thinking of weeks later.",

If they take that much pride in their pizza and will not send out sub-par food they must really take pride in everything they do. Bartenders were very friendly too. Amazing experience!! I will be back for more food just because of the GM and the bartenders",

One of the things that attracts us to Pizza rock is the fact that they cater to celiacs (Gluten-free)....  We ordered our usual to accommodate the celiac person in our group and the waiter told us that the gluten-free oven was \"not working\".  He seemed bothered by the fact that we were ordering a gluten-free pizza and his attitude reflected it. When I went to speak to the manager on duty (Paige),  I found out that the oven was working just fine. Page sent another server over and the rest of the meal went fine.",

Great surprise!   Tons of TV's, great sound and good visibility from most seats. Love that they have an indoor outdoor area.   I've been here a few times, but never wrote a review. The food is all pretty good. Amazing? Nah. But really really good. they have a ton regional pizza styles. From the Neapolitan style, the Detroit cracker thin crust,  and even a deep dish style. I've had them all before and all really good.  Today my wife and I split a Stromboli. Pizzas here are just too expensive for us. But the $13 Stromboli was perfect for us to share. Maybe not if we were both super hungry, but tonight it was great.   All good things you say? Why only 4 stars? Well this is pretty overpriced for pizza. Really the only feasible option IMO is to come for happy hour. Beyond that it's rough to justify coming regularly. I mean a glass of White Zin was $7. A Blue Moon was $7.50. Just gets too pricey to come here on a consistent basis. Every now and then we come to grab some Zaaaa and watch a game, but with the myriad of sports bars in the vicinity with MUCH cheaper drinks and fairly comparable food this isn't usually on my food stop rotation.",

Clearly they serve pizza as well. There are also pastas and lots of different beers, IPAs, stouts, etc.   I've never had to wait to get a seat, although we typically dine at off hours like 4pm. They have happy hour each day from 3-6pm and lots of appetizers and drinks are half off. Who doesn't love that?!  So far my favorite pizzas have been the tomato pie, New Yorker and Detroit red top. The last one is a pretty darn big pizza, enough to feed 4 people. We ALWAYS order the truffle fries which are perfectly crispy and tasty.   One downside is that it is in a casino so smoke does drift in from time to time and it is quite loud with the TVs and slot machines. But you don't go to pizza rock just for the atmosphere, it's the food!",

We were having a blast bouncing from happy hour to happy hour and stopped at Pizza Rock.  It took another over twenty minutes for their happy hour French fries to come out and another 30 minutes to made one personal pizza. I could understand if the place was busy but we were one of set couples in there when we arrived and there were 8 couples by the time we left.  The personal happy hour pizza was delicious. Perfectly cooked and mouth watering.  The frys have that horrible batter that seems to be all the rage in cheaper fast food restaurants.    A French fry is already deep fried.  It does not need an extra grease absorbed batter.  If you're chef who insists on trying to reinvent the French fry please don't!  If you do please also offer for centuries old traditional French fry.  There's nothing wrong with a little rose mary or garlic but stop trying to batter my fries!    In closing I will say that the restaurants motif looks Rock n roll cool and the staff were super friendly. They just need more staff so that they can get orders out at regular restaurant speeds.  So if you have the time, take the time and check out the Green Valley Ranch location.",

The trivia night didn't make sense as the music from the casino muddled out the host's voice. Is there a manager to supervise and control the atmosphere and service? I could not identify one..   Now to the food... We opted for the Americano pizza... We were told it had a thick crust, we were surprised it wasn't. The pizza was utterly sloppy and greasy. Everything fell off of the dough... The calamari seem promising but the breading was not one bit crispy and was soggy. The sauces were not as tasty as it had looked in pictures. Everything lacked a kick factor and did not deliver texture-wise. I wish I could have squeezed a WHOLE lemon tree onto the calamari for some complementing flavors but hey, no servers, no bussers, no managers around to assist.  I hardly give one stars but this was one experience that disappointed me so much as I went FAR out of my way to try this award winning spot.",

It's thick and square cut. I get it without the garlic drizzle on top because that's just unnecessary.   The restaurant is non smoking but it is open on two sides to the casino where smoking is allowed. You are close to slot machines so if someone has a cigar there while you are eating, you are out of luck. BUT they have a covered outdoor space that's shaded and cooled so you can sit out there even when it's super hot out and you won't be exposed to the smoke.   There's five million beers, many on tap. Kids will like it, too. It has 80's music and a giant truck inside.",

The service though was lacking. Our server made a comment that she had \"17 tables and everyone wants food\". Well yes, that's why we come to a restaurant! It took quite a while for the fries and garlic bread to come out.vthere was also a long wait for the pizzas.   We ordered the garlic bread, meatballs, Gorgonzola fries and the CalItalia pizza. The garlic bread was awesome, some of the best I've had. Bread was soft on the inside but crunchy on the outside and it was loaded with garlic. The Gorgonzola fires were also excellent. The flavor was fantastic but I just wished the fries were a little more crispy.  I thought the meatballs were okay, nothing spectacular. The CalItalia pizza was a wonderful combination of three cheeses, fig preserve, prosciutto, shaved Parmesan and a balsamic reduction. The combination of the salty cheese and prosciutto with the sweet fig and balsamic was perfect. My only complaint was the crust was a little underdone for my taste. I will definitely be back for happy hour again.",

Pizza Rock was started by a guy named Tony Gemignani who is a Triple Crown winner of International Pizza Championships in Lecce, Italy. He is also the 2007 World Champion Pizza Maker at the World Pizza Cup in Naples Italy. He's the first American and non-Neapolitan to win. To start I recommend ordering the classic meatballs or the Honey Calabrese sausage. Both are delicious. As far as pizza goes the must try is called \"Sausage & Stout\" it's made with Honey Malted Guinness Beer Dough, Green Onions, Crushed Red Peppers, Beer Salt and drizzled with a Sweet Guinness Reduction. It's amazing  they only make 23 a day so hurry. Another favorite is the Old Chicago which is outstanding. I get it well done and I add pepperoni. 3rd on my list is the Honey Pie. It has Mozzarella, Calabrese Peppers, Serano Pepper's, Green onions and local honey  topped with fried caramelized onions.! A few other popular choices are the Cal Italia Gold Medal Winner with Asiago, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, Fig Preserve, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano and Balsamic Reduction!  The Margherita which won the World Pizza Cup in Naples, Italy Has San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Fior di Latte Mozzarella, Fresh Basil, Sea Salt and EVOO. Whatever you do don't go and order a cheese pizza, take a chance step out of your comfort zone and order 1 or 2 of their specialty pizzas. Better yet get some friends or small group and order 3 or 4 different pizzas so you really get the experience. It will change your entire view on pizza!    happy pizza hunting Ciao",

I ordered the Cal Italia pizza (see photo) as well as the Gorgonzola fries. The flavors in the Cal Italia are incredible and blend together beautifully. The Gorgonzola sauce on the fries isn't overly \"cheesy\"- really good. All in all, DELISH!!!! The prices are moderate ($19 for the pizza and $8 for the fries), but you get large portions.

She did come by and refill our drinks once.   The food runner that dropped off our pizza forgot about a side of ranch that I asked for.   Overall was an okay experience. Could have been way better if server was around more. But the food was really really good no complaints there. Maybe next time will be better, if I decide to come back.",

    "text": "Gone here twice.  Had a wait-list both times, but the last time we opted for the pizza-bar.  The wood-fire oven and I were separated by a glass.  It was cool to watch the pizza chef work his magic.  He was very clean and busy the whole time.   The service the first time wasn't up to par, hence the fifth star knocked off, but the last time fiance and I were there, service was superb!  The waitress was super sweet!   Now, I did get a little bitter towards fiance waiting on my pizza.  I assumed, like a dumb-dumb, that all pizzas were going to be made by this pizza chef in front of me.  I was wondering why he wasn't making my pizza and assumed the waitress did not punch in the order.  But there's another kitchen...  Don't worry, I didn't let my hangry self affect my composure towards her.  We ordered the New Yorker the first time - way too big for two people, but was freaking delicious!  Goat cheese was creamy and sausage was the best!  The second time we order the St. Anthony - holy cow, yum-mazing!  It had basil, fennel sausage, and EGGS-over-easy on top!  We mixed the eggs evenly throughout the pizza; it gave it a creamy, yolky flavor.  Definitely a must try!",

I stopped by on a Sunday night with a friend before he was to drop me off at the airport to fly back to LA. We ordered a regular pizza and 3 drinks. The pepperoni/mushroom pizza was one of the better ones I have had in a very long time. The sauce was very, very flavorful and the drinks were nice. But when the $31+ bill came and I handed her a $100 bill, the waitress only gave me back $68.00 even. Where was the change? I just have an issue when businesses round up the bill in their favor. I am not going to create a possible embarrassing situation for a quarter but the waitress should know her arithmetic.",

Jennifer the advised:  \"its called a kids menu for a reason, so no you cant order off of it\".   The manager was kind enough to come by to advise that the kids menu is a discounted & designed to lure locals in.   I am a local & all I wanted was  small pizza.  His last advise:  \"you know I will just buy you a pizza if that males you happy!\".,.,,   Perhaps this Stations Casino Restaurant really doesnt like locals thus contradicting their marketing strategy.  The economy is poopy--I have cash & all I wanted was a small personal pizza!",

Don't get the fries if you have any kind of aversion to bad breath. The garlic sticks with you into the next day. THIS IS THE BEST GLUTEN FREE PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD. I have been on a gluten free diet for about 5 years now, and finding a gluten free crust that isn't soggy in the center and too crunchy to even eat on the outside has been a challenge.  The gluten free crust at Pizza Rock is down right perfect! I asked for it a little crispy, and it came out with the crust just right and the center was also crispy.  It didn't have the strange flavor that most gluten free crusts have either.   We will be making the drive from SLC to Vegas just for the pizza for sure!",

Our server brought us water and said he just needed to set down his tray and he would be right back. For the next 15 minutes, we watched him bring tables drinks, take orders at another two tables, and begin cleaning a table and never returning to take our order. We went and got the hostess who was kind enough to put in our order. One glass of wine, meatballs and a pizza. When we finally caught our server's attention we asked what happened? He replied that he would have come back but the hostess came and took order. He said the wine would be right out. More time elapses. Out come the meatballs, which although they were tasty, they were lukewarm at best. Still no wine and now we are out of water. Server brings wine to the table behind us. And finally brings my glass of wine. One sip and it was obviously the wrong wine. After waiting to get his attention again, we give up and go to the bar to exchange the wine. The appetizer is finished and still no water. Out comes our pizza which was advertised as the New Yorker. Again tasty but what was supposed to be a charred crust was burnt beyond recognition. The whole outer edge of pizza was inedible. At this point, we were too tired and hungry to send it back. We just ask for our check which he does bring right away. We immediately place our credit card on bill and continue eating. After we had finished eating, he still had not returned to collect payment, so we took it up front to hostess stand to pay. Unfortunately we weren't the only table having difficulty. The table behind us was brought their salad without the grilled chicken they ordered. They were told to go ahead and start on salad, and chicken would be out soon. They were not pleased. This is not an inexpensive neighborhood pizza joint where you expect less than satisfactory service. For the prices they charge, you should expect and receive more. The food was mediocre at best and the service was awful. We will not be back.",

A bit pricy, at $28 (generously serves 2), the flavors of the beer crust, the creamy fontina and mozzerella, spicy sausage and sweet Guinness reduction sauce were a favorite even for super-picky RAW, whom I was afraid would have a fit about the \"sweet pizza,\" but he liked it. For another $5 the pizza comes with two pints of Guinness. The house salad is very good--fresh and dry. Served with a creamy basalmic--be sure to ask for extra dressing if you like dressing on your salad...they are a little chintzy, but will gladly give you more.",

    "text": "I'm from Detroit and never heard of a Detroit Red Top, so my wife and I tried one out of curiosity. It reminded us of a Buddy's pizza, and it was fantastic. When you get to the crust around the edges an uncontrollable smile appears on your face.  It's pricey at $27 for four large slices, but we each only ate one slice and were full. While the food was great, the service was not. It took five or ten minutes for our waitress to reluctantly wander over to our table, and then appeared irritated that she had to take an order. OK, so we will not be ordering alcohol tonight. The hostesses were also dull pencils. It was almost like the staff had just received a lecture from the boss and were all mad about something. With decent service this would have been a five star rating. The Fremont area downtown location has much friendlier staff.",

Good thing we didn't have a show or movie tickets! I got the dessert calzone which was not even warm and still had raw dough in the center. So disappointing! Pizza Rock is open to the casino so the cigarette smoke just travels right in. I think they should have closed the restaurant off to avoid this issue. It was a busy Friday night so maybe this is not a problem all the time. The experience as a whole was just okay. I wouldn't drive far to get here. However, the food is good.",

The previous time I came in, the place was packed with a 30+ minute wait. This time, it was almost dead inside.   We sat at the bar. Our bartender never introduced himself, but the check said Josh, so I'm assuming that was our guy - black spiked hair, triangular sideburns. It was pretty much an all out fail this last time. There were about a half dozen employees hanging out at the end of the bar, looking bored. They were slinging racist jokes and dropping F bombs, just a few feet away from us! Real classy. I couldn't help but wonder where the hell management was at!   We got two beers, which BOTH had some kind of mystery \"floaties\" in them, after which we were eyeballing our plates and flatware. Pizza took a long time and was bland. We got a large house salad which was entirely lettuce. Literally, there was like one piece of onion and a half a slice of tomato. Inattentive, unpleasant service when there was no one in there, bland food, dirty dishes...The only reason I'm giving three stars is the other two times the pizza was good and service was fine. They do also have a healthy beer selection. Just an off night I guess, but if that was my first time I would never come back! Management, crack the whip! You haven't been open long enough to be this lazy! I'll give it a break for a while or just stick to the downtown location which has always been fine.  P.S. The cheese in their caprese salad is breaded and fried, which is not mentioned on the menu. On the menu, it reads like a normal caprese. I did not like the fried spin on it.",

We mentioned that to our server and she admitted that the Lasagna served in their Downtown location was bigger.  Now people if you're going to bother to put it in writing on the menu it better be \"huge\" otherwise you just look ridiculous.  My husband's dinner came out first and I had to wait 20 minutes for mine to show up.  Not very professional.  Either serve them together or serve them at the same time!!!  There is no other choice.  That's just common sense.    In their defense I must say the food was Excellent.  The Lasagna tasted very Fresh with a hint of Sausage Flavor.  The Stromboli was amazing.  Now That was Huge!.

The variety of pizzas was really extensive and based on their choice of ingredients, a lot of thought was put into creating the menu selections.   We started with the Calamari friti (half original, half Calabrese...which is spicy) and got the thin crust, award-winning New Yorker (Mozzarella, tomato, link sausage, garlic, pepperoni and ricotta). Totally loved it. The Linguini and clams was perfectly seasoned. Can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu. Great service.  It is located within the Green Valley Ranch property which is good since we like visiting the area. Nicely decorated interiors with a \"rock\" vibe. There is a semi truck and trailer incorporated in the interior design and serves and the command center for the music and videos playing on the wide screens all over the restaurant.",

    "text": "So my man and i stopped in for lunch today as i have been very excited for it to open, and what better way to watch college basketball than over a hot pizza?   Anyway the food was good. We got the four meat pizza with goat cheese, arugula, and these tiny sweet red peppers that look like teardrops... So good! But then again, it really is hard to go wrong with prosciutto. We also split the Caesar salad which was a little underdressed, but otherwise fresh and delicious.   Atmosphere was good, not too crowded and  not too loud. Good tvs for watching sports. The only reason it isn't a 5-star is the service was decent, but not great.   However, I'm hoping to check out a $7 signature personal pizza and a $2 off glass of wine during happy hour (early or latenight) and be able to bump this up to a 5!  So then, if you live in the area, it is definitely worth checking out.",

We had the New Yorker but it was a hard choice because a lot of them sounded good.  Fresh ingredients, great tasting sauce, perfect crust.  This is definitely my new favorite pizza.  The service was friendly and very attentive.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because it is a little pricey.  The pizza and two Pepsis were $33.00.",

    "text": "Pizza Rock's newest locale inside Green Valley Ranch was a bold move. Sometimes we patrons out here in Henderson are passed over in favor of the glitz and glamour of the Strip, so we're stuck with whomever decides to grace us with their culinary presence.  Well thank goodness Tony Gemignani and crew did, because the food is incredible. We started with the meatball appetizers - amazing. The meatball is dense enough to get a good bite, but not so dense that it's dry. The gravy (sauce) is amazingly robust without being too acidic. Plus it has just the right amount of chunks of tomato in it.  We moved on to the Fried Green Tomato Caprese. The tomato is bathed in a beautiful corn meal crust, fried lightly, and bedded on top of generous chunks of mozzarella with basil and a perfect balsamic reduction. This was a definite plate licker.  The beer selection is amazing for a 'pizza joint'. Lots of good selection on tap - ask your server for their recommendations! Beer turns over quickly here, so don't be sad if something is out.  We moved on to the New Yorker (amazing! STOP modifying this pizza, people!) with it's lovely mounds of fresh ricotta that meld with everything once you fold that pie and take a bite (you better be folding these slices!). My husband also ordered the pear and prosciutto and that was a great take on a creative twist.   The atmosphere is really great, the flow is pleasing and the wait staff is surprisingly attentive and polite. Great job Pizza Rock!",

My fiance got the Pizza Rock Benedict and I had the Double Sausage and Egg Pizza. The also have bottomless Mimosa's and Sangria for $15 and a killer 22 oz Bloody Mary with bacon for $10. We are already regulars here and their brunch just gives us another reason to come back more often. The manager Tommy (as always) made it a point to stop by and say hello. Great job again team! We are so glad to have you so close to us. Finally a great place in GVR to visit!",

Went here for lunch with 2 other guys. Ordered two pizzas; the pizza Campari and the Margherita pizza and a large house salad. They only make 73 or so of the Margherita a day. The waitress wasn't exactly sure why, thought it was something to do with superstition of when the chef won a pizza competition. I thought it had to do with the dough or the mozzarella, both of which were so delicious and fresh.  The portion size was perfect, the brick oven crust had just the right amount of char, and the toppings were bursting with flavor. All pizza is delicious to me, good, bad, hot and cheesy, cold and chewy, thick crust, thin crust, its all yum. But if you want to treat your taste buds like taste bros, then you have to try out this pizza spot.  Love love loved it.",

The music is loud so if you're looking for a place to have a conversation while dining you may want to go somewhere quieter, otherwise the atmosphere is fun and hip. Highly recommended!",

This a regular take out for me . My favorite menu item here is the Calamari . It is tender and fresh and fried lightly to perfection . The Calabrese sauce is just spicy enough and they also give you their homemade marinara sauce option for dipping .  I don;t care much for their pasta or sandwiches which are average at best but like everything on the menu , a bit pricey for Italian takeout . now I'll pay extra for something special like the Calamari and pizza but not for average food .  Speaking of Pizza , I have tried 3 types so far . The New Yorker , The Mob Boss and the New Haven style clams and garlic thin crust . Starting with my least favorite the Clam garlic is very tasty but I do know of at least 2 places back in New York that make this much better. The Mob Boss is very good with plenty of fresh ingredients for toppings . The New Yorker is fantastic ,a real work of art . Extremely flavorful , I can see why this pie has won many awards .   So one boo for the Pasta and pricing and 5 yeahs for the rest equals and nice 4 star rating , maybe 4 1/2 stars",

Over 10 minutes later they brought out a sub with cold meatballs and unmelted cheese.  They said they would fire it for another 5 minutes.  15 minutes later the bartender said they burned it again.  The manager came out and contradicted her and said the bread got soggy from the cold meatballs.  She seemed very intent on justifying why the sub was taking so long.

More of a snack sized pizza but a good way to try a few different kinds! Happy hour drinks are plenty and at $5 for a draft, I passed.

    "text": "We had heard that the wait times for this location were very long, so I made a reservation on Open Table.  We were seated almost immediately at a high top table with a good view of the guys throwing pizza dough which is always entertaining.  Service was good, their beer menu vast, and their food menu intriguing.    We had a hard time deciding, so we went with traditional pizza joint staples, figuring that we could be more adventurous on future visits if we liked the standards. We started with the House Salad: Mixed Greens, Cherry Tomatoes, Red Onions, Mozzarella Cheese, Croutons, and Balsamic Vinaigrette $10.  The presentation was nice and was served family style. It was a basic salad, but also very good.  All the ingredients were fresh and flavorful.  Then we went for the New Yorker Pizza $25- a 16\" round pie, with a lightly charred crust, Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Sliced House Link Sausage, Garlic, Pepperoni, and Ricotta cooked in a 700 Degree Electric Brick Oven (some of their pizzas are cooked in a 550 degree gas brick oven, some in 700 degree electric brick oven, and some in a 900 degree wood fire oven).  The menu said this pie was the \"Winner, Best Traditional in the World, Vegas\", so it seemed like a good choice.  The flavors on this pie all worked really well together.  The sauce was more acidic than sweet (how I like it) and the ricotta was very smooth unlike most places where it has a more gritty texture.  The pepperoni was also cut small and thick.  It was very good and tasted nothing like pizza chain pepperoni!   We enjoyed this place and will be back to try something more adventurous!",

    "text": "Love this restaurant! Being from Buffalo I am picky about my pizza and this place passes the test. I've been here several times and have enjoyed every pizza I have tried.  I love that they opened this location because it is so much closer to work and I don't have to go downtown whenever I want some of their pizza.   We started off by ordering the meatballs. This is a must have everytime I go to the restaurant. You need to try them! They are my favorite meatballs of all time. They are so soft and melt in your mouth. The sauce is also to die for and is half of the reason why I enjoy them so much. I almost wish they would serve pizza with a side of this sauce so I could drunk the crust in it.   Yesterday we decided to order the Sicilian with pepperoni and banana hot peppers. It was really good! The pizza is thick so if you are not a fan of having doughy pizza I would try a different pizza on the menu. Luckily I really enjoy thick pizza so I enjoyed it. The only thing I could have asked more of was the sauce. Their sauce is so good that I wish the pizza had a little more on it.  We finished the meal with the apple calzone. It was two tiny calzones with apple inside and caramel drizzle on top. It was served with a small scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. It was good and was a smaller portion so I didn't feel over guilty about indulging in a few bites.   If you're looking for a new pizza place to try in the Hendreson area I recommend Pizza Rock!",

The place nor the bar were very busy, so I wasn't sure why 1 glass of wine and 2 vodka/tonics took almost 10 minutes to wait. Aside from that the food was some of the best I have had in my life. We ordered the artichoke hearts for the appitizer. They were beer battered to perfection and had a great dipping sauce.   The pizza was the absolute winner of the afternoon. We ordered the sausage and Guinness pizza because it sounded odd and different, so we thought why not!  Oh.My.God.  Words cannot describe how tasty this pizza was. I shed a tear when the last slice was eaten. It was that good.   Our next trip out we will for sure be back to try other items on the menu. Food, music, funky decor, what more could you ask for!",

We had planned it to take advantage of the happy hour specials. It wasn't very busy and were seated immediately.  They have a large dining area with plenty of seating.    Positive points- the Gorgonzola fries are amazing. I love the cheese sauce covering the fries.  And they weren't skimpy on the sauce! The Chicago Cracker Thin Sam Giancana Pizza is delicious. Their sauce has a fresh unique flavor.  This combined with the provolone, sausage and garlic makes it a fabulous tasting pizza.    Room for improvement- service was lacking a bit.  It took a while for him to even greet us.  By the time he came over, we were ready to order.  It also took a while for him to remember drink refills.  When our bill came, the price on an item was higher than states on the menu.  I had to show him what the price should be.   I'll come back for the food. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for better service.",

There was only 2 of us in our group and our server seemed more concerned with her larger table in our area. After waiting 15-20 minutes and finishing our appetizer (which she didn't serve us our check on us during) we finally asked the server for the table next to us if she could take our drink order.  When we placed our order initially with our server we asked her if she could give us a few minutes to look over the beer menu but asked for waters while we waited. Our server came and checked on us half way through our main course (that she didn't bring either) that is when we ordered refills for our near empty waters. She jumped right on it and we had those within 8-10 minutes. The other server in our section was in our area frequently. Over all it seemed like poor planning/scheduling for the serving staff. They should have planned better knowing it was MNF and also the promo for the Knights game.",

    "text": "Now approaching four years at Green Valley Ranch Resort Spa and Casino it was in celebration of National Pizza Day that seats were taken at Pizza Rock, the same table earmarked for eight guests in April 2016 this time hosting six including a young boy who was kept entertained by an ADHD-inducing stream of people doing stupid things on CHIVE TV displayed across several televisions.  Largely unchanged through the intervening years, Tony Gemignani's team still in charge of several ovens while front-of-house is competent but mostly perfunctory in terms of service, it was following a group of conventioners that guests were seated at 11:30am, approximately 50% of the Restaurant's 200+ seats filled an hour later as Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and R.E.M. played at modest volume.  Spread across a lengthy space with everything from a big truck to bar area, the menu equally expansive with Pizza-styles from New York to California and Naples represented, it was after clarifying both the order and timing that Drinks were filled, Iced Tea for many instead of Pepsi products while others simply drank Water that was kept full across the ninety-minute visit.  Slow to get started, NCAA Basketball plus live NHL action and conversation filling the time, it was after perhaps half-an-hour that two Pizzas arrived simultaneously, an \"Old Chicago\" baked in brick with gas outperforming any Midwestern \"Bar Pie\" thanks to unbleached Flour that maintains a lot of tooth beneath piped Ricotta, Sausage and Meatballs while a touch of Cheddar provides just enough Salt to brighten a thin layer of Tomato Sauce.  Not skimping on Ingredients, the $26 \"New Yorker\" placed on a stand next to its Windy City cousin loaded with Meat and Cheese, guests in search of a great \"Slice\" will be delighted to see Tony's Award Winning Pie blistered and bubbly, the ability to stand up with barely a fold attesting to quality Flour and evenly heated ovens while housemade Fennel Sausage adds a lingering herbal essence that plays well off the char.  Finishing every bite of round one, specifically requesting two additional Pies be fired twenty minutes later preventing a log-jam previously experienced both at Pizza Rock GVR and DTLV, it was as trays were cleared that Cal Italia and Detroit Red Top were presented, the award-winning former expectedly sweet but brilliantly balanced inside a delicate Cornicione while Mo-Town's recently resurgent style showed Gemignani to be ahead of the curve as he's been offering this buttey pillow almost fully encased in Cheese and striped with Marinara since opening at the Downtown Grand in 2013.  Disappointed to learn that Brunch is only offered on Sunday, the French Toast targeted as Dessert thus unavailable while Pizza Rock's Mud Pie wasn't \"ready yet\" at 1:00pm, it was in consolation that four Zeppole were offered, Tony's Flour frying up more like a Beignet with great texture and pronounced Cardamom that paired well with both lemony Cream and thick Caramel but less-so Dark Chocolate Sauce.     FOUR STARS:  Every-bit deserving of his myriad accolades it is great to see Tony Gemignani succeeding across multiple Las Vegas venues, the owner's hands-on approach undoubtedly on display in a kitchen from which every Pie both looks and tastes as it should, though the FOH still seems a bit robotic and being \"out of\" menu items (save for those listed as being in limited supply) is unacceptable.",

The classic done well, this one with all my favorites on top!

Thin, crispy and again, well done :)  Or you can try something different :  Cal Italia : Asiago, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, Fig Preserves, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano & Balsamic Reduction. Perfect combination of salty and sweet, with a bubbly, almost hollow crust.  But you'd be hard pressed to find a much better bite than the :  Detroit Red Top : White Cheddar, Wisconsin Brick Cheese, Butter Toasted Corners, Marinara, Garlic Oil, Romano & Oregano. Excellent! Crispy cheese baked under the crust and spilling over edge! Heavy but worth every bite :D  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Out of all the eatery/bars in GVR, I would have to say Pizza Rock would be my favorite. Why? Well first of all the smell lingering next to and inside this eatery is absolutely mesmerizing. Pizza isn't even my go-to when I buzzed or hangry, but when we initially walked but this place I just had to have a pizza slice for dinner that night. Plus, I loved the hip hop that was blasting through the bass filled speakers- so yes I told myself we were going to eat/drink there after hitting the craps table.  The menu is quite large so they offer basically any combination imaginable. If it's not on the menu then I'm sure they can create it. This night, I wanted to be super basic and order a simple pepperoni pizza. I figured if their most basic pizza was bomb, then everything else coming out that kitchen would be good too. And yup, I was right- this pizza was freakin' delish and had tons of pepperoni pieces all over. Huge plus is that the pizza wasn't that oily after doing the napkin test.   So if you're ever buzzed/borderline drunk at GVR and you're deciding on which place to eat- hit up Pizza Rock.",

But the sauce had spilled all over the bag and box. I had a stromboli and thought it was okay. I don't think I would order it again, however the portion was huge. Also the sauce had spilled all in the box so the dough was soggy by the time it got to me. We ordered two salads, one single and one that was family size and both came as single orders... so that was kinda annoying. I'm down to try Pizza Rock again to give it another chance. In my opinion, you should stick to getting the pizza though from the menu!",

    "text": "Like many, I too have eaten at the downtown location. I will say that the pizza quality is pretty much identical to that of the downtown location. What separates the location is service. The service here was subpar at best.  To start, this location is located inside the Green Valley Ranch Casino. We sat at a table that had a roulette wheel in the middle of it. Pretty cool. The layout is very spacious.   Upon our arrival to the table, we let our server know that we would be split up into four separate checks for the eight of us. He seemed to be okay w/ it. As we ordered drinks, we looked over the menu. Since we all knew what they had it was easy to order. By the time he came back to take our food order, one of my friends had finished his Diet Pepsi. The server recognized that and look at him 'Diet Pepsi?'. However another 5-10 minutes went by and the server came to check on us again. He saw that another friend had finished his drink too. He looked at him 'Pepsi?' As he nodded, my other friend raised his empty glass 'Diet Pepsi please?' About another 5 minutes went by before they had their refills. Shortly after the food arrived.   I hadn't tried the wings at Pizza Rock yet. My friend offered me one to try. They ordered buffalo wings. They weren't soaked in it, just enough that you could hear/feel the crispy bite. Def the right way to make them to have w/ an ice cold beer. Pepperoni, Veggie and a New Yorker covered the table. I got the personal pizza.   About 10 minutes after our food came the server stopped by to see if we needed anything. I told the server I wanted to get a personal pizza to go and some boxes for my friends. It was awhile before we saw our server again. When he came back he handed me a box w/ a New Yorker as if to say it was my personal pizza I ordered. Nope. I handed the box to my friends that ordered the New Yorker as it was their slices. At that point we asked for our checks.  Our server was able to split the checks up as requested. There were a few mix ups w/ sodas and booze being placed on the wrong bills. I ended up paying w/ a comp. One to which I wouldn't have used the entire amount. Now in other casino establishments I've eaten in, when it's not all used the server says, 'the rest will go back on your card'. That didn't occur here. Then again I never got my personal pan pizza either.   Food good. Service bad.",

    "text": "I've been here many times, to a few of its locations including Sacramento. Today was by far the worst experience ever. The place was packed and I'm not joking when I say there was literally 1 waitress for the whole place. When I asked the waitress about this, she told us that the manager scheduled her but didn't want to call anyone else in because it was a day after Christmas.   We spent over $75. Our New Yorker pizza was so over cooked that it hurt my teeth to eat the crust and there was barely any cheese or toppings.  The garlic bread was also so burnt that my sister cut the inside of her mouth. When we told the manager about this, his attitude was terrible. He brought us a new one and when he did he absolutely patronized us by saying \"here's your extra lightly baked garlic bread.\"  The zucchini fries were decent.  Personal cheese pizza, better than the higher priced New Yorker. I've lived in New York, This pizza was subpar.  My friend waited about 20 mins to receive each beer (he had 2). Our waitress told us there was only 1 bartender too.   The New Yorker and the garlic bread were so bad that I ate my nieces leftover Kids spaghetti and meatballs because she was full.   Sometimes, even though not ok, you can expect a waitress to be short and/or rude but coming from a manger, totally unacceptable. Our 1 waitress even had an attitude herself, granted she was the only one serving, there's no excuse.   I'm actually pissed about my experience today. I will never go back to this particular location, go to the one downtown, don't waste your time or money.  If the owner knew about my experience today and the fact that his restaurant was entrusted to one absolutely rude manager and 1 waitress, I would hope that he would be livid.  Nothing in this review is exaggerated...very disappointing :(",

Baked cheesy like parm crisps not the ooey crust type. the pepperoni slices are crispy like chips and about 1/2\" in diameter. i drizzled alot of their chili oil. I love their green beans. they are garlicky, not mushy, crispy, and sweet. the zucchini fries comes w a cheesy creamy dip and it's excellent. get those three things and a bottle of chili oil to go. i love that detroit pizza. such buttery goodness. staff is very nice.",

My husband is a meat lover and his favorite is a pepperoni & sausage on a cracker like crust which doesn't fall apart.

We saw servers walking by us many times and we even saw a server helping the table next to us but we didn't exist. No said I'll be with you or anything. I felt like we were ghosts sitting at the table. After a while with no one coming by or acknowledging us, we walked out. I told the hostess that no one came by as we were walking out, I assume it was the manager he said something along the line sorry we'll take care of you right now but at this point I had enough and it was a little too late. I was already upset and there was nothing changing my mind.   Too bad I was a regular to the Green valley location, now no more. Too many good pizza places in Vegas that I would go to a place that treats you literally like you didn't exist, the restaurant was kinda full but not to the point they we're overwelmed, I got seated as soon as we got to the restaurant. It was bizarre my friends and I wondered why we we're ignored and no one said I'll be with you in a minute, those words  would have been all it took for us to stay and wait longer. But like I said servers walked by many times and no one seemed to care to help us.  We got into my car and took off to another pizza joint down the street.",

Food and drinks were served in timely fashion and we all ( party of 9) felt very taken care of. Food at both Pizza Rock restaurants is always amazing tasting! Meatballs ( of course) quinoa salad- margherita pizza- Rochelle even suggested a delicious beer to try. Never once did she seem overwhelmed by the size of our group plus the other zillion things she was doing. The manager ( Ricky) does a great job running a very busy location and it seemed like all the other patrons were enjoying themselves as well.  HEY TONY!!! Another great eating establishment!!!

It took her about 20 minutes after taking our drink order to get our food order.. I ordered eggplant parmesan and my boyfriend had the St. Martins pizza. When our food came out, I went to bite into my eggplant and it was very difficult to eat, burnt, and did not have any flavor. After trying to cut into it and failing I gave up and pushed it to the side. I ate some of the pizza but it also lacked flavor. Regina finally came back to check on us and we told her that the eggplant was not good at all and over cooked. She apologized and said \"sorry I should have checked on you guys sooner.\" Although, they took off my meal on our check, the manager never touched our table. I was frustrated with our experience and we won't be returning.",

And we must say, pizza rock quality of pizza is up there and definitely in the top 5 best pizza here in Las Vegas.  The service was great. We came in on a happy hour that we didn't expect. On top of that, we got 10% off for being local with the exception of the happy hour prices of course. The ambience pretty much says it in the name, its Pizza Rock so expect some loud rock music. They got some patio seating and I did notice it being not so loud there, so for you folks who cant handle the loudness perhaps a seat out there is right for you. :)",

The people at the front was too busy chatting it up with each other to notice that we were waiting to be seated. After we got seated and ordered our food it took forever and a day to get a refill. I literally had to track someone down to get another fill of my soda and more ketchup.  The waiter passed by us many times and did not even offer to fill my friend's water which was clearly empty.  When the other waitress came by to give our personal pizza that we ordered; she looked at us and basically dropped the pizzas on the table loudly with a frown. She didn't say anything and just left. I would not go back to this venue again because of the horrible service.  The food was alright for the happy hour prizes but not worth the feeling of \"why the hell are you eating here for?\" service.  1 unhappy star for this place!",

Seems to be the regular type of service @ GVR restaurants where staff are millennials. Noticed their attitude is better towards younger looking patrons i. e. Under 30 yrs.of age. Good pizza though. I recommend going across the street to Setebella for pizza. It's better quality for similar price and without the 'attitude'.",

Unfortunately, the anchovies were on top of the pizza, ruining it  for 2 of the people in our party. The waitress admitted it was her mistake and she forgot to tell the kitchen to put the anchovies on the side. We returned the pizza and the waitress came back out about 5 minutes with a \"new\" pizza. However, the pizza was barely warm and smelt like anchovies, it was obvious that they had just picked off the anchovies. They did not re-make the pizza and tried to pass it as a re-make. We sent the entire pizza back, paid our check and left.  It will be a very long time before we ever go back to that place, if ever. It was very disappointing, especially when they tried to fool us into thinking they made a new pizza so quickly.",

The first time we went to Pizza a Rock was at the downtown Vegas location. When they opened up one in Henderson... Well, game on!!  We have tried more than half their pizzas and we are still figuring out which is the best. I also bring guests here and they always want to revisit. Like today, I picked my friend from the airport and came straight to PR. The Napolese pizza, noted as one of Americas top 50 pizzas, is her favorite, ever. Whenever we come to PR we all order different unless it's the very large styles. We even order and pick up.  This place is very popular so make opentable reservations. I always do that especially for dinner any day of the week. We came in for lunch today and the place was not busy. So choose... Lunch or dinner reservations.  Now for my favorites, depends on my mood. Today I ordered the Cal-Italia because I wanted something light. If for some reason I want a pizza with spice and flavor, the picante is the way to go.  My friends either order the Stromboli or Henderson pizza. They swear by the Stromboli.  It's all good. So look at pictures, check their online menu, etc. This place has it for pizza in my book!",

It was obviously busy..so we wait. People started leaving. Front desk girls grew to 4 hanging out chit chatting away while people left. 20 mins into our wait, I noticed a tables are being cleaned, figured they would be calling us soon. 10 minutes later, they were still chatting up and 4 of them standing around talking and socializing. Another customer walked up and asked about his table, was told they would have his table ready soon. So I asked about our table, I said I was told it was a 40 minute wait, a long haired, short girl with obviously fake lashes corrects me and said \"Actually it's 45 minutes and your time is not up yet\". Not the answer I was expecting nor should have been said. I pointed out that there are tables open..to which she gladly said \" They are all reserved\". I walked away to avoid saying anything I would regret. Another 10 minutes later..we finally got called and was placed at a table that sits 4! We were a party of 5. I politely asked to be seated at a bigger table that is clearly not occupied and available since we had to wait for 50 minutes!!! The only saving grace is the waitress ..she was lovely!  They are in the business of customer service! I was not asking for any special treatment! It's very disappointing to be treated and talked to they way this employee did and to try and sit us at an awful table right on the hallway where people walked in and out! I feel that that girl purposely did that to us! This employee represents Pizza Rock - poor representation. Service Recovery would have been the approach for making your customers wait instead of making me feel that you are punishing me for questioning your obvious lack of good service!  By the way the table that I asked for initially that she stared was reserved...NO ONE ever sat at the table!!!! How horrible is that!",

The menus are old record albums, with the actual records in them. Very cool! The Guinness Pizza is the best one we've had out of the several we have tried. That thing is off the chain! Get a couple of pints with it. The service is a wee bit slow and the main reason it's 4-stars is that IT'S SO DAMN LOUD IN THERE!! I get it, Pizza ROCK. But man, the music is so friggin' loud you can't really even have a conversation with people one foot away. Too much. But I'll take earplugs and go back for the pizza.",

Not to mention, it was incredibly delicious. Super fresh ingredients, and they don't short you on toppings one bit. My buddy had the Michigan Ave pizza and it was delicious as well, amazing tasting crust. The hostesses are blah. Not real emotion, just put on a fake smile and go through the motions, but our server made up for it. Janelle is a rockstar! She was working 8+ tables and killed it. I'm a former server so i understood the stress she was under, and she didn't show it at all! She was very attentive, gave excellent recommendations, and super friendly. I will ask for her the next time i go back. Overall, 5/5!",

Their award winning pizzas that I've tried were amazing...although none were quite cheesy enough for me, but that could be because I lovvvvvvveeee super cheesy pizzas. Last time we went they had bottomless mimosas for brunch. Several flavors for $15. Great value if you plan on drinking more than two glasses.

We were created by the bartender I believe her name is Kimberly she was very nice and super sweet so we decided to stay and give it a shot my chicken sandwich came out under cooked it was really hard to chew I was embarrassed to tell her but I couldn't swallow it it was so bad.  She looked out it felt it was cooked enough so I put a piece in my mouth and pulled on it to show where I can rip it apart she then informed me that was very unattractive when I did that I didn't have to do it she then came kind of snotty said she would take the sandwich off the bill the bummer is she was so nice in the beginning and then just turned on me when I told her the chicken sandwich didn't taste right sense and I've called three restaurant owners of mine and they all told me",

Not sure what his problem was, but we were the only ones sitting in the back section next to the semi truck so he wasn't busy. He never bothered asking what we all wanted to drink while we looked at the menu, or even at any point of our time there. We ordered our appetizers and entrees at the same time, and he disappeared for 20 minutes. Got our garlic bread, which was very stale, and then we waited and waited. Two of 4 entrees came out, and a few minutes later our server jogged around our table without saying anything. Two people still did not have their food, and we didn't see him again for 20 minutes. He tried jogging around our table one more time when I finally blurted out to him that my friends never received their entrees, but he kept jogging past me and didn't acknowledge I was even in the room. So I chased him down as he was talking to the host, and he looks me square in the face and said \"I already heard you, I'm going to get your meatballs..\" to which I said \"you ran by me so fast you failed to hear that my friend never got their pizza as well.\" Plus if he heard me, then why would he go chat it up with the host for 5 minutes instead of checking on the meatballs? Then he finally comes over to the table and acknowledges my friend, and says he'll check on the missing pizza and meatballs. The meatballs were an entree for one friend, so she has been waiting patiently to eat for 45 minutes at this point, and the pizza was for another friend. The server comes out and throws the meatballs on the corner of the table and jogs off again, with no apologies to the girl that ordered them nor did he even give them to her. Then a while later he comes out with my other friend's pizza and apologizes to him and said they would cover the cost of his pizza, but never once apologized or comped the meatballs for her. Then when it was time to pay, we pooled our cash in to pay the check, he took it and said he'd be back with our change, but instead vanished and kept our change which we didn't even give him permission to keep.   I come to this pizza rock all the time and I talked it up to my friends from out of town, and it was a huge embarrassment to have a server treat them that way. I would really like to have a conversation with the GM about it, because there is more to this story and I'm positive there is an underlying issue in that server's treatment of customers.",

We had both with gluten-free crusts. Mike S. also made some recommendations on which ones work best with the gluten free crust so we will have to try those next time.

    "text": "3.5 stars Came here to give Tony Gemignani, 11 time world champion pizza winner a try.  They have different types of ovens for different types of pizza and also use different types of flour for the different doughs of each pizza.  They have a wood oven, coal oven, regular pizza oven, traditional stone oven.  They make NY style pizza, Napolitano style, Detroit style, Scilian style, California style, Chicago cracker thin.  They are all cooked at different temperatures, in different ovens, with a different fuel source, made the way its supposed to be.  There were a few award winning pizzas that you could choose from, and i wanted to try the Sicilian style, but i went with the Chicago cracker thin, (Sam Giancana) because i have never seen or heard of this  style of pizza before.  It came topped with slice meatballs, italian sausage, and ricotta cheese, and was cut into squares.  No complaints, just not so special.  Personally i prefer NY style or Sicilian style but i was glad to try it, otherwise I'd always be wondering about it.  My friend got the award winning Napolitano style Margherita, which she liked.  I did try it but I'm not a fan of Napolitano style pizza because its too wet for me.  We came during happy hour (3-6 every day) and also got a personal (Tony 2 times) pizza, salami, pepperoni, mushrooms and double sausage and mozzarella.  It was just that a personal pizza rather small, but just enough for 1.  I think i'd get the picante next time.  I also tried the Oskar Blues Death By Coconut porter, OMG so good, very smooth and intense coconut flavor, i think my new favorite beer!  and also $2 off during happy hour!  I thought the pizza was okay, I'm pretty confident i could give it a higher rating if i ordered the type of pizza i actually like, but sometimes you gotta step out and try different stuff when its unique and different.  Im told the meatballs are a must try too.",

    "text": "Finally I'm posting a review for this place. I've had mixed feelings about it.   First Kat. Good person, great conversationalist and has a joke or two. Seriously though - she is the saving grace in this. Thank you for your awesome service Kat!   That's not what we come to restaurants for. Yes, it helps for the experience to be better - however let's face it folks, we come for the FOOD! No amount of awesome service experience can make up for that.   That being said - let's get one thing squared away - beer, wine and alcohol comes from a bottle/keg. A cocktail of course is left to judgement -  my beer however was great. As expected from the draft or bottle.   So, moving on from alcohol... the food. Sub-par and something you could easily expect from a Las Vegas casino (especially the \"locals\" favorites).   Happy Hour. Cool. I can expect you're not bringing out the big guns here - however, have some pride.   I'll make it very direct;   - Fries - did you reach at the bottom of the freezer bag? These things were like eating shattered pieces of glass. Seriously, fried potato shards aren't exactly enjoyable for anyone.  - \"Fried\" green beans - I guess I need to check my expectations for these. I think \"fried\" I assume breaded. That's on me for assuming - because they're green beans \"fried\" in oil. Which I would say \"not long enough, that's for sure\". Underwhelming. Lubricated green beans with some fresh garlic and maybe seasonings.   The Pizza. (Oh this is where it gets weird)  Being as the Happy Hour menu really suited our appetite tonight, we decided to tapas style the experience. Pizza Rock is known for their pizza (it's in the name, c'mon!), and we have had their larger pizzas in the past, so we figured why not grab some personals and try some combos we haven't had. Well, let's just say the pizza experience from the larger pizzas doesn't transcend into the personal pizzas. They are poorly topped and the crust is less than desirable. The quality wasn't that much better than what you would find from a frozen pizza at your local store.   Also, being vegetarian, it somewhat cheats us to order off of this menu because they almost 80% of the time cater to the \"mass audience\", whatever that means, and so we find ourselves usually Frankenstein-ing some kind of \"take this off and \"sub this\" type of scenario, or better yet, just cheese. Oh so fun. Tonight in particular, we ordered one of the more veggie heavy combos and asked to replace the prosciutto with artichoke hearts. The craziest thing happened, which happens often and I am being sarcastic, there's of course an up-charge. Yes friends, if you take the protein off (usually the most expensive part) and add a VEGETABLE, you will be charged more.   We gave up the artichokes, and of course no meat, and moved on.   Alright, so we decided to wrap this meal up, hopefully find salvation, and ordered the mud pie (which is pictured with this post).   This takes me back to a time where I remembered the fantasy of these decadent desserts was ruined when I found out most cakes or ice cream concoctions are stored frozen and then topped and dressed before they come out. (Is that a big deal, not really)   That is, unless it's too frozen when it comes out to eat. And it happened here. We got a frozen mud pie. It's ice cream, what's to complain about right? Well let's just say it took some serious patience, strength and overall after losing a few chunks to it shooting off of the plate and on to the floor (yes it was that hard) - that we gave up and Kat, again amazing server/bartender, took it off of our bill and ended the night.   I gave this experience a 2 stars. Through and through the food is what we come here for and now after having a mix of good and bad experiences, I know now that there's thoughtfulness from the kitchen that's extremely lacking. Owner of Pizza Rock - I've heard your story, I know you are an enthusiast and take your business seriously.   Please take a look at how \"automated\" your restaurant has become. There's a responsibility to your locals to be A-1 level at all times and your back of the house is starting to roll out to the front of the house.   Truly, I really enjoy your Pizzas - and want to bring this up to five stars. Guess we will see on the next visit ",

    "text": "I have been to the downtown location a couple of times.  This was my first time at the Green Valley Ranch outlet.  5 adults and one ch9ild gathered for lunch recently.  We had 4 pies and zeppole for dessert.  The pies were:  Old Chicago New Yorker Detroit Red Top Cal Italia  The first three were all very good.  It was the first time I had a Detroit style pizza.  At first, I cut my piece in half because of the large amount of tomato sauce.  It was so good, I returned to the tray and retrieved my other half.  The sauce was so rich and flavorful!  The old Chicago and New Yorkers were more what I'm used to and they did not disappoint.  Of the four pizzas, the Cal Italia was my least favorite.  I'm not a fan of balsamic vinegar and the fig preserve along with the balsamic turned me off.  The sweetness is alien to my pizza tastes.  At the same time, the pizza had one of the best crusts of the four.  The zeppole for dessert were good.  Chocolate and caramel sauces along with the citrus flavored whipped cream made for a very good combination.  I'll have to eat here sometime when I'm at GVR and prepare to have take home for breakfast the next day.",

    "text": "I give Pizza Rock 5 stars but it ought to be 5 diamonds because Diamonds are forever! Pizza Rock is one of, excuse it is my favorite place to drink beer and eat pizza and watch sports  in the entire universe! Not only to they have great food and beer, but they also have amazing service. This place kinda reminds me of like a real life Cheers in that everybody knows your name and therefore you feel like family and those who know me know I love family like Dom Toretto loves 10 second cars.  Speaking of service and all stars, Josely is like a first ballot hall of fame bartender! She has an amazing personality and when she's serving you, she's very attentive and has a never ending attention to detail. One also has to admire Jo Jo's focus and how she's able to juggle things like dealing with 20 guests, the well area, and those to go orders from grubhub, postmates, etc.. On a side note it's crazy how she can remember your drinks and so I feel like as a guest that's bonus points when your with your friends, I know as a server I too can remember certain peoples order and they get happy.  As far as food goes, Pizza Rock has hands down the best happy hour west of the Mississippi River, and South of Flamingo St.. There's 2 different times one can come in and experience greatness (3 to 6pm daily and 10 to 12am Sunday through Thursdays, 10pm to 2am on Fridays and Saturdays). I love their meatballs and Tony 2 times, along with the Gorgonzola frys. Basically one can order and spend like $30 and have an amazing time and deals like this are find to find unless your a Groupon junkie lol With Pizza Rocks regular menu, this place is loaded with lots of options. My favorite Antipasti~ is the Calamari because they are huge and the Calabrese Aioli is nice and spicy. The Gorgonzola and Apple salad is refreshing and the portion size is generous. There's many of pizzas to try and I would say I truly enjoy their Chicago cracker thin style! OH I forgot to mention, Pizza Rock is also an amazing place to watch Vegas Golden Knights games! If you are wearing VGK attire, you get a free beer and well every big screen has the game on so you can defintely feel the energy especially when they score because somebody will hop into that semi truck and honk the horn, the crowd goes wild! Lastly something I really admire about Pizza Rock is their CULTURE(winner winner chicken dinner). First off they have an amazing concept and I'm surprised there's not like one Pizza Rock in every state, instead of like 3. They play amazing music  and something that is even cooler is that they promote within. Some companies talk about it, others be about it. I've seen first hand over the years, people like Allen getting promoted from busser to bar back, I've seen Billy go from server to manager as well as Paige, I've seen Frankie go from bar back  to server, and so these kinds of moves are amazing because to me its all about promoting from within! The best stories are the ones where you started from the bottom and you climb that company ladder, Bravo Pizza Rock...  I hope you can see I love Pizza Rock and I highly recommend this place but warning you that you will become addicted. Thanks for reading!!!!",

It was delicious, I got the watermelon martini, a house salad and the pizza, I was so impressed with how good the pizza was! The bartender also mentioned the pizza carries over really well and she was totally right! The service was also really really good! I'm glad I decided to give it a try!",

The crust is just perfect  and the ricotta adds a nice creamy flavor .   One thing I ALWAYS get when I come is the Honey Calabrese sausage is a perfect mix of sweet and spicy . It's honestly one of this best things I've ever tried .  It was my first time trying the The Fried Green tomato Caprese and it surely did not disappoint . I don't normally care for tomatoes this dish was awesome . I could eat this everyday . The mozzarella was so fresh and the fried tomatoes actually tasted fantastic . The balsamic and the sweet drop peppers added the perfect bite to it .   Also, I did not get a picture of them but we ordered the classic meatballs and they were also very tasty.   On top of the food being amazing , the service is always great and fast . The environment is great for adults and children . They have good music playing and sometimes even a Dj in that cool semi truck they have as decor .   Do yourself a favor and try Pizza Rock . One of Las Vegas greatest pizza joints .",

I won some money plus I got back what I put in.  The restaurant uses text messages to notify the patrons when they're next to be seated. I received a text and we were seated shortly after returning to the restaurant. My husband and son joined us and were handed menus which are real album covers with a album inside. Our waitress was friendly and brought our drink order quickly. My daughter has to eat gluten free: fortunately this restaurant has gluten free pizza that isn't cross contaminated, as they take precautions. I ordered the chicken wings which are not coated in flour but dropped into the fryer and after they come out, they are tossed in either barbecue or buffalo sauce. I ordered mine without the sauce and they were tasty and crispy. My son and husband ordered the spaghetti with marinara sauce and meatballs. Our food was fresh, hot and delicious. My husband remarked it was some of the best spaghetti he's ever eaten out before. My son enjoyed his spaghetti and meatballs too.  The restaurant was very busy. The ambience was loud as they play rock and roll songs over the speakers and they have flat screen televisions that were broadcasting the Golden Knights playing at the T-mobile arena.  It was a nice dining experience. Our waitress Allison was very nice and patient as we decided on what we wanted to order. She was attentive and friendly. We will definitely return in the future.",

    "text": "TUESDAY TRIVIA NIGHT YA'LL! Came for the food, left with knowledge I didn't know I needed.  Pizza Rock is located inside GVR, but can be spotted from the uncovered parking area. Easily seen and accessible. Came here with coworkers and their family members. We made a reservation over the phone the day before and was quickly accommodated when we arrived.   We were met with a smile from both hostess and server. Drink orders were filled swiftly and we were closer to filling our bellies. The menu had a variety of different options, but didn't feel overwhelming. Appetizers, pasta, calzones and pizza dominated the menu. We settled on Zucchini Fries and a plate of Calamari Fritta. Fries came with a nice mild sauce that complimented the fried goodness. Their Calamari Fritta was on point with 2 different sauces. One was a bit spicy and the other was the traditional marinara. They have an option for half spicy and half original Calamari. I highly suggest it if you like a bit of spice.   Our pastas arrived first, and from first glance I was worried about the portion. It didn't seem like much, but the more we dug in, the more we realized how wrong we were. We ordered Fettucini Alfredo and spaghetti with meatballs. Holy snap those meatballs were big, AND meat was mixed into the sauce as well, so you get double protein! As a group of 8, we were already half full from the pasta alone! When the pizza came out we steeled our stomachs for the impending food coma. We downed both the Butcher and New Yorker Pizza. The meat on the butcher was absolutely delightful and full of juice (amazing bacon, for the win!). The crust was a bit over cooked, but I've always liked a crust with crunch. The New Yorker had incredible cheese that just melted in our mouths. If I could take all the meat from the butcher and mix it with the cheese from the New Yorker I would be set for life.   Our server, Jenn (I believe), was so patient and great with everything we needed. It was our first time there and she made sure we were happy, full and content. Drink orders were always filled! My girl! Would I recommend this place? Heck ya! Should I practice and brush up on trivia so we don't end up being in 10th place? Double heck ya!",

After my husband was ignored I walked over to ask if I should check in or would the reservation be faster. The hostess told me the reservation would be faster.  That was so not True. Other people got in that checked in while we were standing and waiting as we continued to wait for our reservation to be called.  One of the hostesses finally came over to explain after we appeared to become frustrated. I understand the waiting, but they can't seat a reservation early that they know is standing there when a table becomes available?!?  The waiter Vincent was amazing! He was with us in minutes. We quickly had drinks and our order was taken.  He checked on us regularly and kept out drinks full!! He is a 5+ star for this restaurant.",

We are for sure going back to try the other pizzas. Omg the creamy Gorgonzola fries are to die for. Now I will explain why I gave it a four star instead of a five star review. We had left over pizza that we had them box up. When we left we forgot our pizza and we realized as we were walking back to the car. My husband went back and they told him sorry that table was bussed and it was thrown away!!!  He left mad but when he told me I was more upset because who does that others places put aside to see if the customer comes back. So I called the restaurant while we were still in the parking lot to speak with a manager and all she could say was they were busy and tables were needed which I understand but why throw away someone's food that was asked to be boxed up because they wanted to take it home. So after getting the manager to see my point that we weren't gone for more then 5 minutes top 10. She cuts me off by saying oh we have your pizza here your waitress put aside and didn't tell anyone! Just a little annoyed by that and then when my husband went back in the two girl hosts in the front didn't even say anything to him they just pointed to the box!! So rude!!",

    "text": "We arrived before our party, and ordered drinks at the bar. The craft beer selection is extensive, so if you have a taste for quality beer, this is the place to go. We ordered the Old Chicago while at the bar, and it made for a delicious addition to the great beer that we were drinking. The ricotta cheese on each slice is the equivalent of the cherry on top of a sundae that you save for last.   Once our party arrived, we decided on the Artichoke Joe and Detroit Red Top to feed the rest of us. Of course, the server was courteous and accommodating. I soon had a different brown ale coming, so I might have the opportunity to sample a small portion of their beer selection.   The Joe came first, and it was delish. I had one slice, but the dollop of sauce on top was once again the focus of my attention. Folding the slice in half meant that it was evenly distributed throughout the slice.   Last, but definitely not least, was the Detroit Red top. It's an intimidating slab of crispy cheese, thick dough, and the signature red sauce. I was already full from the previous pizza and beer marathon, but a cohort and I decided to split a quarter. (the whole slap comes in four pieces, which is ridiculous. The damn thing could feed a small village. It should be 8 to 12 pieces!) I was lucky enough to get the corner piece, because the crust and crispy cheese combination around the edges is mind blowing.   Overall, definitely the best pizza place in Henderson. The three different pizzas that we tried all had completely different themes, including crusts, toppings, and sauces. All three were also delicious. I congratulate the chefs. Well done. The service was prompt, courteous, and knowledgeable , and so received a significant tip.   10/10 would bang again.",

    "text": "We had a 7pm reservation for 4 people on Saturday night.  We arrived and were quickly taken to our booth.  The booth was a bit tight for four people and none of us are big people by any means.  4 True pizza lovers would not have fit in the booth.  For starters we had cocktails, nothing special.  Then one of us had a salad and another had the chicken parm.  For dinner we ordered three different pizzas.  So, here goes the review.  The salad came, then about 5 minutes later the chicken parm came, then one pizza came.  Now imagine a tiny table with a pizza, chicken parm, 4 glasses of water, 4 cocktails, their silverware can and spare plates.  We did not have room and the staff just kept pushing the plates inwards until stuff started coming off the table.  Finally we managed it but was not comfortable.  Then the second and third pizza came, one of them was the new york pizza and larger than the other two smaller/personal pizza ones.  We were totally out of room, plus the pizza came out cold.  They said that they could not heat it up and fired another one up.  So far, nothing was super tasty.  The music was blasting and we had to raise our voices quite a bit to talk with our party and it was really, really warm in the back of the restaurant.  We were all breaking a sweat.  Finally, a while later, the replacement pizza came out and it was warmer, not hot but warmer and didn't have the toppings we wanted, we told them and they brought the toppings over in a bowl. .......    To summarize, super loud (pizza rock), food was at best, just OK, very warm, and the accommodations are not built for anything more than one pizza on a table, nothing else.  I do not recommend unless you like to eat with super loud, booming music in a hot restaurant and room temp food.  Bill for all 4 of us was 150.",

The first time we were in a rush to make it to a movie and waiter was able to accommodate us to get our drinks and food out as quickly as possible. The second time we got to relax a bit more and enjoy the atmosphere. The wine list is good and the menu has a good range for what it is. I ended up ordering the meatballs as an app and they were fantastic. The best part is dipping your pizza crust in the leftover sauce.  The video DJ they had on a Friday night was kind of cool. I would have given this 5 stars but the loudness of the restaurant was overwhelming at times. When you're dining with a group of friends I don't enjoy having to yell to have conversations.

That's attractive to me since I'm a wine drinker, and the price list starts at $8 (that's $4 on a Wednesday). I've had the Italian Chop Salad twice and it was large enough to split. It was fresh and tasty and had lots of Italian salami. The price is right for its size and quality. My favorite pizza is the Detroit Red. It is a bit pricey for a pizza at $27 but it is a pizza big enough for 4. It is a rectangular deep dish with buttery crispy edges. All I can say is WoW. It is delicious. On our last visit, there were 7 of us at the table and we shared the pizzas and the Detroit Red was a hit. I also liked the other ones I sampled but unfortunately I didn't order them so I'm not sure what they were.",

    "text": "Such a welcome nice addition to green valley ranch where it combines great ambience, service and good quality. Considering the fact that Pizza Rock is known for award-winning pizzas, I unfortunately did not get to try one of their specialty pizzas rather their pepperoni and cheese pizza due to accompanying my nephews. Don't get me wrong, this pizza is still of great quality but I was excited to try some of the award-winning pizzas. I look forward to having a chance to try one of the specialty pizzas for a chance at five stars. The Boss and New Yorker looked insane and as a bonus, those burgers look really tasty also. Welcome to the neighborhood.  (Part of the reason why I am giving it five stars is because of the overall service also. Our second pizza had a small hole that was cut out of the pizza, so they served it but let us know that they will be giving us another full pizza. The size of the hole was no larger than 2 in.2 but they were kind enough to make a call to just give us another. That's the service that they provide here.)",

    "text": "Omg. If you like pizza, this is the place. Thin crust, thick crust, normal toppings, exotic toppings, this place ROCKS! We tried 3 different types of pizza. The Detroit Red Top was my fav. We added pepperoni (for a $3 up charge) and it was worth it. The \"burnt\" cheese edges were a treat in itself. Next was the Old Chicago. Thin, crispy, not overly saucy. Great pizza for thin crust lovers. Finally, the limited quantity (only 23 made per day!) Sausage & Stout pizza. Flat bread type crust with a Guinness reduction sauce. Not my favorite as I am not a fan of caramelized onions and scallions, but for onion tolerators, it was delicious! Service was excellent. Seated quickly and our waiter was attentive and made recommendations that suited our tastes. Granted, we dined on a Saturday afternoon, but I say the staff is well trained and capable of handling a crowd. Try it!! You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "So exciting to have one of my favorite pizza joints in my hood. We were having dinner with a friend that loves pizza so we recommended trying this location of Pizza Rock. We had been to the location downtown many times, but hadn't had a chance to try the new one in GVR.  I called a few days prior to make a reservation. Gal on the phone was super nice and they were able to accommodate us within 15 minutes of our requested time. Then they called the morning of our reservation to confirm.  We arrived right at the time of our reservation and were taken directly to our table. The location within the casino is nice. It's right on the perimeter near parking so you can walk right into the casino and immediately turn into the restaurant, avoiding the locals smoking liking fiends. The decor is nice, very similar to the downtown location, and they have a patio, which is always a plus.  Our server - don't remember her name - was very nice and attentive. There are a couple of differences from the other location. I usually like getting the Romanos, which are all delicious, but on this visit we kept it simple. We got a regular pepperoni ( I know, don't judge, the kid requested it) and the New Yorker. Both were delicious. We also had the garlic bread, which was good, but nothing spectacular.  I always love the music at this place, but at times it can get loud. Yikes, I sound old! The only misstep this visit was that our garlic bread seemed to take an awful long time and arrived at the same time as the pizza, which kind of defeated the purpose of an appetizer.",

The pizza was cooked perfectly and had that slightly charred finish around the edges. The crust had a great chew to it and it allowed for straight slice eating or traditional folding. The ricotta cheese was extremely smooth I did not have that sometimes gritty texture that ricotta can have. The sausage on the pizza was extremely flavorful. The service and the pizza made us fan.

We went on a Wednesday night around 7pm and were greeted with a 40 minute wait. Ok, maybe everyone else is enjoying some seriously great pizza. There is plenty to do at GVR so we left a number to have the hostess text us when the table was ready. After about 40 minutes we make our way back to the hostess to see if our table was ready. She says she definitely sent us a text. Ok, whatever. Technology doesn't always work.  We were seated and put in our drink orders. When we finally started ordering our pizza our waitress informed us that it was about a 40 minute wait for pizza because there are only three ovens. I'm sorry, what? If 800 degrees can crank out a pizza in 90 seconds then surely Pizza Rock can go faster than 40 minutes. Also, it would have been nice to know about the 40 minute wait up front, since our total wait was now pushing an hour and a half.  We stayed the course, however, and ordered two pizzas. Our first pizza came out.  It didn't stand a chance. We devoured it. Then we sat there with greasy hands and mouths, just staring at each other. I think our waitress sensed our frustration and told us our second pie was about 30 seconds from being finished. Ten minutes later the pie finally shows up. It was delicious as we expected, but still completely unacceptable to wait so long.   Our waitress apologized for the wait and said \"we'd like to make it up to you with free dessert.\" When we each tried to order a dessert she said \"oh. Just ONE free dessert. So you know.\" Whatever, lady, just bring it out quickly so we can leave already.   We already knew that the food would be good so I'm not even going to comment on that. Overall this was just a bad experience because of the service. We felt like we were deceived at every interaction with the staff. Even the attempt to make up for every other mistake came with an asterisk. For as long as it took this place to open, they need to get their act together from a service standpoint.",

I thought the meatballs and sauce were excellent, 5 stars.  The margherita pizza was also very good. I liked the fact that it was very doughy. Some people like a nice crunch, I don't. I like pizza saucy, cheesy and doughy. That's exactly how the margherita was like.  Also ordered the big pizza with all the different toppings ranging from balsamic, to pepperoni to olives.   Didn't care much for that one. But like the song by meatloaf goes, \"2 out of 3 ain't bad\"  Prices were high, tourist trap alert.",

    "text": "Super disappointing trip here. I was very excite they were putting a location in Henderson, but I would rather drive to the one downtown. First the guy who came to take our drink order was very rude and said if we wanted anything on the happy hour menu we needed to \"hurry it up because it ends in 15 minutes\" we had literally just sat down, and hadn't even had the chance to open our menus yet. We ordered the Rosemary garlic fries and they were actually pretty good. But that's where the good ends. It took our waiter forever to come take our order, and once he did we didn't see him again. We ordered the three cheese Stromboli. It was just awful. There was too much crushed red pepper in it. Over the course of our meal we had three different servers. And three separate times they tried to bring us food that wasn't ours. Clearly they need to work on their communication. When our waiter finally came back, all he did was drop off our drinks and walked away. He brought me the wrong drink and by the time he came back to check on us it was five minutes later and I didn't even want a replacement drink. I was so flustered by the whole experience that I walked out while my fiance stayed to speak to the manager. They ended up comping our entire meal, but I would have rather had better food and service. Sadly, we will probably not be coming back to this location.",

Then speaking to the manger about my complaint against Jocelyn's he defended her immediately before   I could finish exposing the experience  and appeared quite upset that I asked for his card and the GM's card. Unacceptable behavior in The service industry.  I arrived solo and spent most of my time writing the review when Johnathon maybe forty minutes later startled me and requested I pay my bill and leave the premises Customer service is so important.  I will never accept this treatment and will drive downtown before I visit this establishment again, without a apology.

BUT right after our drinks arrived our pizza came....how can you make a pizza in less than 8 minutes?

    "text": "My buddy and I were at GVR last night.  We saw Pizza Rock was having a grand opening, so we decided to give it a try.  There was a 30 minute wait for a table, so we went to the bar and sat down.  You can order food at the bar and it is first come first serve.  The hostess did not tell us this.  She should tell people that.  We ordered an arugula salad with pancetta.  It was very average.  It lacked much dressing so we asked for more.  15 minutes later we got it after most of the salad was gone.  The pancetta was fatty and greasy too.  The pizza arrived pretty quickly.  The odd thing was, it was not hot.  It was barley warm.   We ordered the NY special pizza based on the waitress recommendation.  We both found the dough to be very chewy and not crisp at all.  The toppings were all over the place and not well distributed at all.  I like hand crafted pizza, and it does not need it to be perfectly distributed, but this was a tad much.  One bite you got all sauce and no toppings, and the next bite all cheese.  I have to say the pizza was not that great.  I did not find any aspect of it to be special.  I would take Settebello (in the District) over this any day.    I know it was opening night, so they probably have kinks to work out, but the pizza should be good at least.  The service was so-so too.  This Tony G guy sure does act like he makes a mean pie.  We did see him for like a minute, and he was not making pizzas.  Also, the music is WAY TOO LOUD!  It is not rock music either, it was mostly hip hop and rap.  I am not opposed to some decently loud rock music, but this was way too loud to even hold a conversation with the person right next to you.  They have some work to do here, sorry.",

I used to go to the downtown location all the time and was incredibly excited that they were coming to GVR, which is just a few minutes away from home. So I have been here 4 times since opening, and I was lucky enough to stop in during mock service a few days before opening.  These were the highlights of my experiences:  -The place itself is beautiful! If you can, definitely walk around the whole place to admire all of the little details they put into the restaurant. They even have pizza box art on some of the walls!  -All of the servers I've had so far have been great. On my 3 visits, my servers were Regina, Rochelle, and Paige. All very friendly and helpful with the menu. -We ordered gorgonzola fries and asked if we could add caramelized onions and pancetta during happy hour. OH MY GOSH. These were the best smothered fries I've ever had. You have to pay a little extra than the normal $3 but it's worth it to add the onions and pancetta. So yummy, these alone are going to be my reason for going to their happy hour on a regular basis.  -Happy hour Cal Italia is so so good(only $7), but the regular size Cal Italia with extra Prosciutto is even better! I'm not a huge fan of tomato so I like that they they have such an awesome white pizza on the happy hour.  -the Gemelli pasta is really salty in the best way possible. It has roasted zucchini and squash topped with olive oil and romana. This was the first pasta dish I tried at PR and I was so impressed! It was cooked perfectly.  -One of the managers, Tommy came to our table to check on the food and he was very friendly. Everyone was friendly, no bad interactions which was great. The list goes on with all the wonderful things at Pizza Rock, but you get the idea! It's delicious and you should enjoy yourself some. They are super slow during the day so it's a good time to visit and get great service!",

We own a restaurant in California and we know what great managers are about! We come to GVR often and are excited to see this first class restaurant here!!  Keep up the good work!!!",

My lunch guests left hungry.    I suppose dining in is different, but I'll never order from Pizza Rock or Yelp / Grub Hub again.

The massive flat screens behind the bar were playing hit music videos from the 90's--replete with baggy ensembles, coordinated choreography, and fuzzy video quality.  This was not my first Pizza Rock rodeo, but I'm somehow consistently overwhelmed by the menu. I was torn between the California style Honey Pie, the deep fried Brooklyn Calzone, and the classic Italian-style Verdura (Veggie) pie. The bartender broke the tie in favor of the latter and boy was he right. The crust was as fluffy and crispy as promised, dripping with gooey cheese that you would need leonine molars to snap in one bite. I washed it down with a tasty cider they had ON TAP.  Dessert was a *MASSIVE* slice of Mud Pie that my roommate and I could barely make a dent in (though we did just each eat 7/8 of our individual 12\" pies). Honestly, it wasn't very good. Drenched in sugary syrup, it had a one-note taste: cloyingly sweet.  My advice: come for the pizza and brews, but you can probably pass on dessert.",

I came here for a friend's dinner they were throwing and ended up fairly impressed. Great service for large parties!   We received so many free appetizers after our server moved us back inside from the cold seating. We really didn't mind too much, but appreciated the gestures. Some items I personally enjoyed were the Gorgonzola fries, The NY Pizza (not greasy), fried artichoke, & Alfredo pasta (heavy though). They were perfect food for after a night of drinking and celebration.   The coconut cooler, whiskey cocktail, and spicy margarita were all interesting. Not too strong or too sweet, but slightly more sweet than strong. They paired easily to drink alongside the food.   The bill was still pretty pricey & I don't think I would go out of my way to try Pizza Rock, but would definitely eat it if at Green Valley Ranch Casino.",

She knows the menu like the back of her hand so all around service was great & so easy with her! Food did take a little longer to come out... But the Cal Italia was  amazing as always!

I never did receive what I ordered. I tried a personal pizza but it came out over cooked. Most in our group also had problems especially with the poor customer service. Servers really should be trained better. But after meeting the manager I can understand the lack of training. Pass this one by.",

Granted, the place was busy but we were all tired and hungry and wanted to order quickly. My drink order had been placed incorrectly and it took a while to bring back the correct drink. The food came out with long gaps in between. We waited an hour for everyone's food to finally be served. Upon inquiring if our food was coming, the waitress said its gonna come out \"family style and we can share\". To share my brothers meal would have been ridiculous considering it was spaghetti. His spaghetti was crunchy, undercooked, and dry. The Mac and Cheese was watery and crunchy as well. The food overall was disappointing. When my mom inquired about bags to take our left overs in, the waitress said we'd have to pack each one in a separate bag and didn't even offer said bags. It would have been more convenient to carry our food in bags rather than balancing the tower we had.The waitress seemed spacey and service sucked. I will not be returning.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time tonight, and have to say Pizza Rock is an awesome atmosphere.  Some other reviews have complained about the music being loud, but honestly being a local of Henderson and going to GVR a lot, it is very refreshing to finally have a place that is trying to project a much younger and vibrant atmosphere. Most of the restaurants and places are around here attract a much older crowd, but I think Pizza Rock is trying to do the opposite, which I like.  Other reviews also complain about the price?  No one forced you to spend over $50, the prices are actually listed on the menu :) If you are on a budget, their happy hour selection is great and features $3 well drinks, and $3 off all draft beers, with $5 personal pizzas!  The hours are 3-6pm and 10pm to close which is great.  The food was fantastic, we got the New Yorker and it was delicious.  Manager and server were very nice, the pizza didn't even take long, but the manager out of the blue comped us all our beers and gave us a free appetizer just because he wanted to make sure we were enjoying our experience.  Like I said, very fun and LIVELY atmosphere, with a DJ who is inside of a real Peterbilt Truck decor that is featured inside the restaurant.  I will definitely be coming back soon!",

The garlic bread was good and the sausage appetizer was interesting however after get a recommendation from our server we ordered the St. Anthony pizza which was a total let down. It was supposed to have an over easy egg on top with a yolk that oozed out becoming the sauce. However when it came out, the eggs were over cooked making the whole pizza dry and inedible.  We told our waitress and she apologized, but when the bill came, we were charged for the whole thing. When we asked our server, she said \"well, I debated with my supervisor\" so in other words she told the supervisor and neither of them cared enough to do anything about it. Also, a side note, the waitress did not even mention it was Happy Hour or that there were specials going on. This makes me feel like she was doing everything she could to up our bill. Oh and this location is also missing the fun rock videos like they have downtown. We ended going to the food court and getting pizza there which was delicious and served with smiles.",

I'd have to say when I first came in I was not impressed, thought twice about coming in the hostesses were a train wreck and rude didn't get names but they were blonde, however still wanting to try the food me and my family stuck around not really planning to come back to be quite honest. My experience actually turned around right after we had a great experience with an amazing little server Vanessa ,she was so helpful in finding the perfect dinner with each of us took time to go through the menu ands she was on point and consistent in making sure all needs were met just all around made it a pretty awesome experience . The food was amazing !!!! We will be back with friends this upcoming weekend !!! Excited to dine in our new little spot!!! I gave 4 stars because despite our first experience coming in we still had great experience and food!!!!",

I have eaten pizza all over the world and this is one of only two or three places that have found a way to completely ruin it.

I LOVE the Honey Pie pizza, little spicy, little sweet and so good!  That wood fired crust is my FAV!!  The staff is trying to get their groove and it has changed quite a bit since opening but it has been consistently good with a few outstanding peeps like Jen and Vinnie!  This place can get very busy so try to avoid rush hour.  The music gets better as the night goes on and I love that they play the music video along with the songs.  The semi truck inside is awesome and I love that they made it a DJ booth.  Hop in and honk the horn!   My only complaint: I wish the hostesses had a little more of a personality and would try just a little bit harder as they are the first faces you see upon entering.  They stand in a group looking rather annoyed and hardly smile.  Once, you get through the door and begin eating you do forget all about them, until you see them the next time.",

Earl and I stood around the bar area and 3 nice gentlemen waved us down to let us know that they are paying for their bill and we can just take their seats.  As we were thanking them, the bartender cleared the bar top and replaced it with a brand new brown paper bag with a stamp \"Respect the Class,\" which serves as a place mat.    Earl order two alcoholic beverages thru dinner.  It was the Basil Basil (Basil Hayden, balsamic reduction, fruit juices), and he thought the balsamic reduction made the concoction tasted off.  The second beverage was just the Jameson with an alcoholic Ginger beer.  This one he enjoyed.  I got a coke.  We ordered the Cal Italia Pizza since it was noted as a \"Gold Medal Winner - Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge.\"  It has gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto, balsamic reduction, etc., so yes, sweet and savory, sounds like the perfect pizza for the night.  However, it was more on the sweet side once we start eating.  What made the pizza delicious though, is the crust.  We loved the crust because it held the ingredient very well while tasted incredible.  We will definitely return to try another award winning pizza.  Earl even mentioned that when he is craves for pizza, we will go to Pizza Rock.",

The garlic bread was really hard do we had to order marinera as it does not come with--also very little cheese on top and I mean hardly any cheese.  We ordered the New York award winning pizza.

I go to GVR often so of course I been to pizza rock!  Love the calamari so there's where u get the 2nd star but there was a lack of service!  She took our order after about a good 30mins of waiting I kindly asked how much longer will it be and the waitress replied with I have a party of 20 in the back so when ever it comes out of the oven! She then comes back 5 mins later and said she took the pizza from that party to give it to us and ask if we wanting anything else I don't know why I even said anything but I asked for a beer and my brother asked for the Knights game to be put on and I'm not kidding she literally rolled her eyes in front of us!  Pizzas was at about one slice left before she comes back and she said I just put your beer order in so u get happy hour price which was a lie cause we got the check and it was full price.  Oh.. and dirty silverware it's pizza so I didn't say anything about it plus it may have made her roll her eyes again which would set me off.  The fact that I didn't speak to management is to not embarrass my brother it would of been ugly!",

    "text": "I think my hubby may have hyped this place up way too much & you know what happens when someone does that!  He's been frequenting the downtown location since he works close by & has been telling me for months how amazing it is. He said the meatballs rival those of one of our fav hometown restaurants, Westlake Joes in Daly City, CA. Eh, seriously hon?? I thought maybe just the quality/consistency was different between the 2 locations but no, he said they tasted the same as the downtown location. They were alright but def nothing even close to Westlake Joe's. I'm surprised he thought they were similar. The sauce tasted like warmed canned crushed tomatoes, too acidic for a sauce & you could tell the meatballs hadn't been simmered in it which is key to making great meatballs, imo. Not much depth of flavor at all & although the meatball was tasty, it was a little too \"meatloaf\" in consistency for me.  In addition to the meatballs, we also ordered the truffle fries, calamari (1/2 spicy 1/2 regular) & the Margherita pizza.  The truffle fries were the best part of the whole meal. You could really taste the truffle oil. We had to ask for salt bc they were under-seasoned but they were still really good. The calamari was just ok. They only serve it with a marinara sauce for the regular & a spicy aioli for the spicy. No cocktail sauce. What kind of restaurant serves calamari but doesn't offer cocktail sauce as an accompaniment?! Being from SF, the only way calamari is served is with cocktail sauce. You usually have to request marinara if that's what you prefer.  Now for the pizza. What a huge disappointment. I was really expecting some amazing wood fired pizza based on my husbands glowing reviews. The entire bottom of the pizza was soggy. I couldn't believe this was what they were calling wood fired pizza. They cook it at 900 for godsake! There should be no sogginess whatsoever. I could tell the ingredients that they used were good quality but it's just so hard to enjoy them when served on a less than appetizing vessel.  I'm gonna throw one more thing in bc at this point, why not? My review is already way too long, may as well end it with another gem. When we received the bill, my husband let the waiter know that he works for x-company & that they give a discount to their employees. He seemed confused & said I'm pretty sure that's only for the downtown location. My husband assured him that his company had sent out a company-wide email letting their employees know that the discount was going to be honored at both locations. He said ok, let me check with my manager & I'll be right back. He came back with the new check reflecting the discount & said that moving forward they weren't going to be honoring the discount for x-companies employees at the GVR location, only at the downtown location but that they would \"do it this time\". *Cue the rolling eyes* Ok, whatever, it wasn't really a big deal & now we knew. We thanked him, paid the bill & got up to leave. As we were just about to the entrance, the manager that our waiter had talked to & had been standing by the hostess booth, physically blocked us from the entrance & went into a spiel about how they would honor the discount this time, etc.. (Yeah, the waiter had already told us the exact same thing!) When my husband mentioned that he  already told the waiter about the email saying the discount would be honored at both locations & that was the reason it was even brought up, he said \"yeah, that's something that YOUR company took upon themselves & decided to do, not something we said was ok\" Seriously?? My husband works for a well known, very reputable company & I guarantee that if an email was sent out, it wasn't done bc they \"took it upon themselves\" He made us feel like complete jerks & considering it had already been handled by our waiter & by that point, we already knew what their new policy was for future visits, we both felt that it was completely uncalled for for him to accost us this way. It left both of us with an extremely bad taste in our mouths. If there was any chance of us trying this location again in the future, it was ruined by the aggressively rude manager.",

Luckily, we were just there for happy hour and didn't have to decide from the bazillion options on the main menu. Most of the menu for happy hour is good (price wise).  We shared the green beans, gorgonzola fries, and each ordered a personal size pizza (I had the Cal Italia). I also ordered meatballs, but never got them. Luckily, we were so full that this wasn't a big deal, and we weren't charged for them.  We were there around 5pm on a Thursday, and it was packed! There seemed to be a wait for a table, so we sat at the counter seating that looks at the wood burning oven.   Our server seemed really overwhelmed, but generally did a good job. The beer selection is decent, but there was honestly nothing that blew me away. However, it is good to see some local beers on tap - although it is not worth it for me to pay a higher price for a beer I can get just down the road, from the source.  Overall, we had a good experience and I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I'm typically hesitant to dine at a newly opened restaurant, but I've been waiting ages for Pizza Rock to come to GVR. I've become a huge fan of the downtown location so I was most excited to have it come to my neighborhood and be able to park with ease. We decided to give a go for a late dinner their second night.   Upon arrival, the hostess area was a nightmare. We saw open seats at the bar and opted to go that route. Service was sluggish to start and never really improved. Sitting at the bar with an empty beer and no water is hard to forgive when there are two bartenders and what appeared to be two managers present. Timing was poor, too, it's a pet peeve of mine when staff asks how everything is before you've had a chance to dig in. It feels like such a cop out and they were guilty of this. I will cut them some slack, though, they need time to work out kinks; and the other location typically delivers great service. Although, my last visit wasn't up to par... hopefully, I won't find that this is the current trend.   Anyhow, I've learned I'm not a fan of the pizzas on the happy hour menu and ordering from the menu is the way to go. I love the Margherita and Cracker Thin varieties, and the calzones and strombolis. The Diavola, and New Yorker are good too. This time we switched it up and tried the Detroit Red Top ($27). The meatballs ($8) are always a must! They are mighty delicious!!  The Detroit Red Top does not disappoint. It's a beast of a pizza, even if it is only four slices. Thick dough is layered with Wisconsin brick cheese, white cheddar and mozzarella and then topped with a robust tomato sauce. There are no toppings, but they can be added - next time, I probably will. But this is no boring cheese pizza. It's the crispy cheese edges & buttery crust that make it glorious.   The beer selection is outstanding! It wins me over every single time. I love the variety and the option of getting the best of our local brews in one spot is enticing. I have no doubt I'll become a regular. Hopefully, future service will do nothing to tarnish those plans.",

    "text": "I met with a group of friends at this Pizza Rock located inside Green Valley Ranch to try their HH menu and agree with Chris V. that this would be 5 stars had we ordered full sized pizzas. Most at our table have visited other Pizza Rock locations and are familiar with the large pizzas and the larger ones are definitely different from the mini pizzas texture and topping wise.   Pizza Rock Meatballs (3 for $4 on HH menu) - This was ordered by everyone at our table and even some ordered more. Thee meatballs were tender and flavorful and the sauce complimented the balls nicely.   Zucchini Fries ($5) - Fried zucchini with fresh herbs, parmesan and calabrese ranch dipping sauce. There was a good amount for the price and the zucchini fries tasted decent enough, but the sauce was too spicy and had a weird taste to me, though a couple other people at my table did like it. I'd personally like it better with some real good ranch.  Fried \"Green\" Tomato Caprese ($13) - The fried \"green\" tomatoes are actually made with brown heirloom tomatoes that top fresh mozzarella, fresh basil and sweet drop peppers and drizzled with balsamic. This was a winner and the fried tomatoes had just the right crispness and paired well with the mozzarella. If you like fried green tomatoes you should give this a try and it's perfect for sharing pre-pizza.   Soppressata Slider ($5) - Soppressata, salami, provolone, mixed greens and balsamic vinaigrette on a baked sea salt bun. This also came with a side of fries which happened to taste really good, but the slider (2 of them) wasn't so good. The buns were so hard that all of us had trouble taking a bite and the balsamic dressing must have been forgotten or at least not drizzled on the slider I had adding to the dryness.   Pesto Paradise ($7 personal size on HH menu) - Pesto, garlic, mozzarella and cherry tomatoes. The menu says this one is made with thin crust. I can't say the crust was much different from the other HH pizzas I tried. The pizza was good, but didn't \"wow\" me. Decent option if you are not a meat eater, but I'd stick to the Cal Italia or Tony 2 Times.   Tony 2 Times ($7 personal size on HH menu) - Double sausage, pepperoni, mushroom and mozzarella make up this tasty pie. I love mushrooms, but left them off this time since I was sharing with hubby and he doesn't like them. I can't say there was double sausage however there was lots of good flavor going on with this pizza. I'd for sure come back and order a full size pizza of this one.   Mud Pie ($9) - Oreo cookie crust, chocolate ganache, coffee and vanilla bean ice cream that's topped with hot fudge, caramel and whip cream. wish all that it has to be good right? Right! The crust was a bit hard to get my utensil through, but we were all able to hack a piece off this huge frozen treat and everyone enjoyed it.   Currently HH is everyday 3-6 pm and they also have a late night HH that's 10 pm to close.",

But the beer offerings are the star here.  They have great happy deals on drinks and food from 3-6pm. It's definitely a worthy happy hour.  The food list is yummy. Duh, there's lots of pizza options. The fries are delicious. I'm particularly fond of the gorgonzola fries. The fried green beans are super tasty. The meatballs are wonderful. And so much pizza goodness. I like that they have so many different options of styles - New York, traditional, Sicilian, Chicago thin, gluten free, etc. And the toppings and combos are seemingly endless. Every single pizza on their menu sounds yummy and intriguing. You can't go wrong with any choice you make here.  So in sum, come eat here.

    "text": "Having grown up in the San Francisco Bay Area, I will have to say that I'm pretty biased towards Tony Gemignani's work.  But at home, his sit-down restaurants are so popular (sometimes up to a 2 hour wait), I usually get slices to go.  I knew that he had opened some locations in the Las Vegas area, but wasn't planning on going out to those areas on my most recent vacation to Vegas.  But, I stumbled upon Green Valley Ranch and was pleasantly surprised that there was a Pizza Rock here.  I couldn't pass up the opportunity to have lunch on a Friday afternoon.  The pizza my wife & I dined on was the Detroit Red Top.  While I've heard about Detroit style pizza before, I haven't had a chance to try it since Tony doesn't offer it as single slices.  The menu says it serves 2-4 people, and it normally comes in 4 huge square slices.  The waitress offered to have it double cut, so it was a little easier to handle.  The pizza came out piping hot, with thick ribbons of marinara sauce poured along the 8 large slices.  When we picked them up off the plate, we wondered on how crisp and firm the bottom was.  Each bite from the middle was very cheesy, but not at all greasy.  And the crust was super crispy and salty, a delight for crust eaters (small children may not appreciate them).  We also ordered a side of fried green beans, which my wife devoured.  Fried really quickly, they were still very firm and had just the right amount of garlic (enough to flavor but not overpower the dish).  In the end, we were super-satisfied with our meal.  We took the half the pizza back to our hotel, which became a midnight snack after a long night of doing what tourists do.  No microwave needed, the slices were still awesome cold.",

I love the Italian chop salad it's the best salad. My daughter loves the meatballs -crowd pleaser. We also get the calamari half spicy and half regular. Love that they have another location closer to our home! Check them out!!!",

    "text": "Don't get me wrong--I usually LOVE Pizza Rock. However, I had never been to the Henderson location before this evening (actually 4:00, so it's not like it was crowded) and while the food was as good as downtown's, my service was AWFUL. I was the 8th to arrive of a group of 10, and it would have been difficult to mistake me for one of the people who had already ordered, as we had to pull up another table for the 3 of us.   The waiter came and took drink orders for the last couple but ignored me, even when I tried to make eye contact. He returned with their drinks and still ignored me. It's True, I was only going to ask for water, which he later told me is only served upon request, but he had no idea if I wanted water or a whole pitcher of beer. Then he returned to take their order, once again ignoring me, and no, I wasn't still looking at the menu. When someone, possibly not the waiter, returned again with drinks and/or food and was leaving, the person next to me asked for some water for me. It was brought, but no query about a food order. When the waiter returned and again ignored me, I got up and confronted him. (Up to this time I had said or done nothing to warrant his dismissive attitude.). Instead of apologizing and owning his errors, he made the above-mentioned excuse that they don't bring water unless asked. Completely irrelevant.   My order was taken  and I received my personal pizza and we all enjoyed our dinner. However some people naturally finished before the last 5 of us but no one was in a rush. Nevertheless, a young lady came to bus the table and took my plate away while I was still holding my last wedge of pizza, although she left some other used plates remaining. This is totally unacceptable. How did she know whether or not I wanted to return my pizza to it's now non-existent plate?  Others were still eating as well and there was no need to rush us.   So my 3 stars is 5 for food, ONE for service, for all 3 of the people that were assigned to our table, and one instead of none, only because I think it was a manager who did bring me my pizza, apologized and said he discounted the bill some. As for the last part, because I was not paying, I don't know how much was taken off.   So go for the pizza, but don't expect great service.",

We literally just walked out because we were seated and waited for 30 minutes while we watched 2 other tables get served around us. Like we were literally invisible. No server even looked our way so I couldn't get anyone's attention. When we walked out we told the hostess and all she said was omg I'm so sorry. Really!!!

Every time I come here, there is a little bit of a wait. But nothing too bad, the longest I've waited is about 20 minutes. But I waited at the bar, which was nice and the time went by super fast! They have a great beer selection and wine selection. And a variety of things on their menu! You can choose from salad, pasta, a variety of appetizers, and of course pizza! I have only had about two of their pizzas (its hard to stray away from my favorites lol) but they were amazing! If you love thin crust pizza, then this is the place for you!  Their menus are in old vinyl covers, which is super cool and I loved it. A super hipster vibe to it. It does get pretty loud in there just because it's inside the casino and the walls are open to see out.   If you're visiting, definitely check this place out! And if you're a local, most likely you've been here before because it's AMAZING",

    "text": "Pizza Rock's food was very good - but their customer service was egregious. I delivered via Yelp/GrubHub. With our dinner, we ordered their local root beer. It didn't arrive with the order, and Pizza Rock didn't bother to contact GrubHub or me to let us know it was ommited from the order. Nor did they issue a refund.   When I called Pizza Rock to find out what happened, this silly girl brushes off accountability--gushing 1 million miles per hour: \"Ohwellthat'snotourproblem-youhavetocallGrubHubandthey'llsendyouanotherrootbeer, k?\"   So, I call GrubHub, wait for some time on Hold, they apologize for the forgotten root beer, issue a refund, tell me to re-order the root beer because they have to assign a new driver, give me $5 to cover the NEW delivery charge and driver tip, I wait and wait for all that to come through, then order again--15 minutes later GrubHub calls and says \"They're out of the root beer. We're so sorry, we'll issue another refund.\"    I call to talk to the Pizza Rock manager--told him I wasted **35 MINUTES** on this ridiculous root beer escapade because they neglected to simply notify GrubHub *OR* me that they didn't FORGET the root beer, they---as the manager intoned---have not even had that root beer at the restaurant for over 1 month.  He says indignantly that the girl who answered the phone did exactly what she should have---she was not obligated to check whether Pizza Rock actually had the root beer in stock, that it was up to the CUSTOMER to go through the entire refund and reorder process through GrubHub before anyone at Pizza Rock would even check to see whether Pizza Rock even had the desired item.  Wow...  4.5 stars for very yummy, well-prepared food. 1 star for the indignant responsibility-shirking manager. 0 stars for silly tornado-speaking girl who answered the phone and couldn't be bothered to ask the kitchen why they didn't include the root beer--which would have saved me 35 minutes on this abject stupidity.",

The crust and cheese is yum and the perfect size for late night eating without feeling too guilty. I'll just keep telling myself that. ;)  Drink: $4 well drinks are good to go and I'll try a trendy craft beer where they'll knock off $2 at happy hour.   I haven't been here other than for reverse happy hour but they knock it out of the park every time. Food and service has always been on point and I'll be back sooner vs later.

But that's besides the point. I've been wanting to hit up every pizza joint out to compare.  The pizza I had was an OK for me. The breading was not my favorite. I also didn't like the fennel sausage that was in my pizza. It just clashed with the other ingredients.  For me, the best pizza is about the crust and I'm also super picky about the thickness of the crust.   Will not be going back for pizza.",

I've tried a pizza in every region and my standouts are the new Yorker, the stout and sausage, and the artichoke Joe.   Also, their balsamic vinaigrette on their house salad is amazing!   If you like beer they also have an extensive collection with quite reasonable pricing.   There are some off nights when service is terrible and pizza kind of sucks but those are very very rare and they always try to make up for it.   Overall, great place for good pizza.",

The only bummer about this place is the service is much to be desired!!   We came in last night and it didn't seem as busy as the lack of service implied it to be. When arrived We were placed on a 10-15 minute wait and they said they would text us, after 20 minutes of the first sent text message and seeing people approach the host stand and seat people before us, we then asked how much longer. The hostess said two minutes, that they would clear off a table for us right now. At this point I'm under the impression that they forgot about us. Once we sat down and got comfortable we looked at the menu! Between 3 1/2 of us we got the New Yorker pizza, the apple and Gorgonzola salad, zucchini fries and beer battered artichoke. I was kinda bummed that they were out of the garlic green beans but that's ok we tried something new!! We also ordered some drinks! The appetizers and salad came out before we got our drinks, at the time it was ok because we had our water that of course we started out with! By the time we got our drinks and our pizza we were low on water. Throughout our whole dinner our server came only twice to refill our water. Once before our main pizza came and once before we left . I think one of my biggest pet peeves, and I'm sure I'm not the only one, is sitting almost your entire dinner without a drink refill. Another HUGE pet peeve that can really ruin an entire experience is when your server tries to rush you and take your plate and fork before your even finished. It was a Whoa moment for me!! After we asked for a refill on water we also asked for the check. As we left there was not even a thank you or good bye or anything from any of the staff including our server or the staff that stood at the hostess stand!!   The only saving grace at this establishment is that the food is spectacular!! I just wish our experience was as tasteful as the food!!",

We're locals, we frequent and I was a little frustrated.

    "text": "Pizza Rock.  I'd eaten at the Pizza Rock downtown, a few months ago.  I had one slice of pizza that was pretty good.   We were looking for a place to host the rehearsal dinner for my wedding this past weekend, and as I was staying at Green Valley Ranch that night, we decided on Pizza Rock.  It was easy to make a reservation, and we had the entire back patio to ourselves.    We arrived at about 6:00/6:15, and were seated almost immediately.  The hostesses were awesome, and very polite, considering when I arrived, I was a little hangry, and was a little short with them.    We had about 25 people in the party, and two main servers, Vinny and Jen.  There were other support staff to run drinks and food.  Vinny and Jen were absolutely incredible.  They were friendly.  They had the party under control.  We had to do the check in kind of an interesting manner (we covered all the food, and drinks for the family, but all other alcohol was separate)...I only had to tell them one time who was to be included on the food check, and they handled the rest.   They both were full of congratulations to my (now) husband and I, and Vinny was even calling my mom \"Mom\" by the end of the night.  Its been a long time since I've had such personable service.    I spoke to one of the managers, who was super nice, too, to let them know what an amazing job they did.  Oh...the pizza?  HOLY. COW.  Seriously, everything we ate was amazing.  We had a plain cheese and sausage that was great.  The Mob Boss(Molinari Salami, Bacon, Pepperoni, Linguica, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Bell Peppers, Red Onions, Black Olives, Green Onions, Cherry Tomatoes, Garlic) and the Old Chicago (Tomato Sauce Mozzarella, Provolone, Garlic, Italian Fennel Sausage, Sliced Meatballs, Ricotta, Romano, Oregano) were the biggest hits though.  Incredible flavor, Mob Boss with thick crust, Old Chicago with thin...I think we ordered 8 of these pizzas on their own.  The veggie pizza was great too, but I ate most of that one. ;)  The rest of the party are huge meat eaters.    Being from Chicago, myself and another Yelp Elite friend (currently in LA) were both REALLY impressed with the quality of the pizza.  And we know good pizza.   Also, can I just say, that any spot that has Delirium beer on draught is a winner in my book.  They had Delirium red, which is my new favorite, and at $8 a glass, I was SOLD.  I had two. :)   So...Thursday night's experience was SO good, that upon returning to the hotel after the wedding on Friday, and walking by, smelling the amazing aroma...my husband and I decided to have dinner there again.  They have a late night happy hour, with a $3, $5, $7 menu...we got two personal Cal Italia pizzas (Asiago, Mozzarella, Imported Gorgonzola, Sweet Fig Preserve, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Balsamic Reduction) for $14!!!  We had Jen again as our server, and not only did she remember us, but she remembered that we had gotten married that day.  We were given a complimentary \"Tony's Tiramisu\" for dessert, and THAT was absolutely delicious.  Morgan isn't a fan of tiramisu normally, but he loved this.    Pizza Rock, you guys are absolutely amazing.  I can't wait to come back to try more of your delicious food.  Thanks for making the rehearsal dinner so easy and stress free, and for making us want to come back again the next night.",

I am not sure if it was we were outside but our server was not very present most of the day and we were fortunate enough to have her change shifts just mid way through our time there. the second server was a little better but still it wasn't that great of service overall. -The food was also a little off. Our pizza which had several kinds of meat was greasier than normal. I know meat and cheese can produce grease but it was a pizza I had before and it was more than expected.  - I will go back to the downtown location but will be in no hurry to go back to the GVR location, not with the other food options nearby",

The New York pizza had a ridiculous amount of cheese on it, more like clumps. It was greasy and upset my stomach! The garlic fries I ordered at the downtown location were completely different here. They were hard and tasted like plain fries. I was disappointed because they were so good at the other location.  The atmosphere was kind of obnoxious. The music was so loud we couldn't have a conversation. I felt like they were trying to get people to notice the restaurant and want to come in. Your pizza should bring in customer, not a club like atmosphere lol.  I'm giving it three stars because of the location. There aren't that many choices at GVR. The places are either expensive or fast food. This is a nice in between, so if you're wanting pizza and have to stay in the hotel, I would give it a try. However, if you're able to leave Green Valley Ranch, you have better options!",

The pizza selection is just overwhelming... there's too much decision making involved. Everyone likes choices but I'd rather not have to choose. Do one thing and do it well, IMO. Grimaldi's and their thin crust in the Brick Oven; Settebello and their straight up Italian style pizza; etc. What I love about pizza is that every place I go makes it an entirely different meal, but I want it to be a no brainer. There's a learning curve involved here and the prices are too steep to order a little of everything.   Great location in the non-smoking part of Green Valley Ranch. Very cool environment that's dark and casual. Service was OK. But we order meatballs and they never came.   We're drawn in now so we'll be back to taste some of the other styles.",

Slow service and took the guy 20 minutes to start rolling out our pizza dough-he was eating in the back. Pizzas marginal-a margarita and a marinara-nothing like the real Tony's. Settobellos is waaaay better. Won't be back here. P.S.-the music is horrible hear-heavy metal playing so loud you can't even think. Great example of a poorly run, no care business-must be a tax write off.",

    "text": "Soooooo glad they opened a Pizza Rock in Henderson...love the downtown location and now I can get the same great pizza nearby. Located in the Green Valley Ranch (right near the Drop Bar), has similar decor as downtown but a little brighter and louder. They do have the semi (DJ booth) and trailer in the middle of the restaurant, which is cool. The staff is friendly and very accommodating, my brother-in-law asked if they could put the Ducks hockey game on the big screen and the manager obliged...  We started with apps...the meatballs (moist and delicious!), the garlicky green beans (yum!), and added the Mac & cheese at the last minute (with bacon and pancetta, c'mon you know it makes everything better!)...we had trouble settling on a pizza to share, so finally decided to get the Roma #1. It has three different pizzas on one large slab...prosciutto,gorgonzola and fig preserve (my favorite, as I usually get the Cal Italia). Then there's the Sopressata, arugula, parm-reggiano with hot pepper oil (gives it a little kick). And the last part is tomatoes, olives, with basil (really good). We were almost too full by the time the pizza came out (almost ).  In my opinion, the best pizza in Las Vegas, and now Henderson...mangiamo!",

Our server came over to get our drink order and welcome us. I mentioned we were here for the first time and he then explained how the menu showcased several different types of pizza styles and told us his favorite. We got the garlic garlic bread and the Michigan Ave pizza (thin crust pepperoni). He offered a side of marinara sauce for the bread. The bread was great and had a nice garlic flavor. The pizza was AMAZING!!! Perfect amount of sauce, cheese and pepperoni. It was cooked nice and crispy. The atmosphere, service and food are first class. He gladly boxed up our leftovers and brought the check, as I was signing, he delivered a salad and french fries to the table beside us. OMG, the amazing smell from those fries!!! We asked about them and were told they were garlic/rosemary fries. That's on the list for next time!",

It's such a gamble going to dinner with kids, sometimes you are made to feel unwelcome. This was NOT the case at Pizza Rock. They were so kind and welcoming. The manager even came over to introduce himself, because we spoke earlier that day when I made a reservation. The food was amazing as well. Huge props and thanks to the staff at Pizza Rock.

The toppings literally fell off the pizza when you picked it up. It was complete mush. When we complained the waitress was combative and defensive saying that's how the pizza is meant to be. Regardless, it's awful. And when you order two different pizzas and your waitstaff seems to know they're both soggy, they should have the courtesy to tell you. We asked to speak to the manager...35 minutes it took him to come over. The waitress kept asking \"has he been here yet? He said he was coming right over\". That pissed me off the most. The fact that we were already very unhappy and that it took him 35 minutes to address our situation. And that he was also argumentative & wanted to give us a rundown of each pizza they serve...little too late for that. So that completely cancelled out the delicious meatballs. The experience was awful. And we are locals. We have dined at the downtown location and the pizza was top notch. My advice would be to make sure the servers are explaining the many different pizzas on the menu. And if a table orders multiple pizzas that are all soggy and wet with loads of sauce, give them a heads up. Can't imagine returning. We probably would be more willing if it wasn't for the combativeness of the personnel. We'll stick to Metro, Grimaldi's & Settebello for now on.",

We ordered two pizzas that were just OK.  They were especially greasy, but they're not stingy with their toppings.  Unlike a few other posters, we had excellent service.  I think they have their niche audience, but, for me, Settebello is more my speed.  The atmosphere and food quality at Settebello is better. They also serve a higher quality pizza, and you can enjoy the company of the people you're with.  But, if you're looking for trendy and loud with OK food, you'll be happier at Pizza Rock.",

Our waitress Paige came over only to take the order and drop off the check. The manager on staff dropped off our drinks and food and also checked on us. At the end of the meal I asked a hostess to speak to the manager on staff but I guess she didn't relay that message because she stayed at the host stand. I just happened to thank him for working harder and being better than his staff. All-in-all if it had been my first go around there then I would not be returning but I know better. There are great servers there and an excellent managing staff and atmosphere. Maybe I'll ask for the best server next time I go there. This place still has great food and it's still an awesome brew menu. I will be going back just not the that server's section.",

(3) of us ordered the New Yorker and a Chicago thin crust Pepperoni pizza. The New Yorker was the best pizza any of us EVER ate. The pepperoni was just OK. Nothing out of this world. But look out. This is a fantastic place that must be visited.",

    "text": "This is a pizza place/bar inside Green Valley Resort casino. The restaurant has both pub height tables and regular height tables along with very nice bar seating The staff was friendly and attentive, this was Sunday afternoon 3:30-4:30 PM. We ordered the peperoni classic and a deep fried calzone. The pizza crust was near perfect and the cheese, sauce and peperoni were all high quality ingredients, the crust is what made the pizza stand out. The deep fried Manhattan calzone was also excellent, next time I will order it with a little more marinara sauce. The selection of beer is extensive, I had the Alpine Hoppy Birthday beer, it was a combination of citusy/sour/hoppy making a good summer beer, 5.5% alcohol and it did not taste watered down at all. Overall a pretty decent first meal there. I will try this place a few more times and if its consistent  with the food and service I will add another star or two.",

We get seated, get our sodas and are looking at the menu when suddenly we are hit with a blast of hot air that blew our napkins, placemats (flew up & hit son in face both times)and menus off our table.! A man that appeared to be an employee walks by and says \"sorry\".  We collect everything off the floor and proceed to look at the menu and bam....he walks out the door and does it again! I decide that this place is not for the kids and I and go pay our $10 bill for 3 sodas that we didn't touch.  I ask for the manager and explain what hsppened and rather than saying sorry, the drinks are on us he just says \"you should have asked to be moved\".... it's at least 110 degrees outside, I've been running around in it all day.  I sit down to enjoy a nice meal and after what just happened I just want to leave.  Comp my drinks and maybe I'll try it again...or don't and I'll tell at least 10 people how unhappy I was.",

    "text": "Terrible service! Just went for a date night, tried to start off with the calamari and ordered our pizza right after. The pizza showed up within minutes....no calamari. We weren't sure if it was a mix up in the kitchen or our server. Pizza was good, not as good as setebello but I suppose you go there for the atmosphere more than the food. At the end we didn't finish all of our pizza and our server said she would pack up the leftovers. Took the pizza and brought us our check. As soon as she came back to get the check she was informed we didn't need change and told us to have a good night and left. She never brought our take home box to us! I'm not sure if the music videos and blaring music is there for enjoyment or more for you to be distracted from the awful service. I never write a terrible review but I think after our dinner it was warranted. Take your money and go across the street to setebello.",

    "text": "We went here with friends tonight. We had heard good things about this place and decided to try it. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer. It was ok, a bit too soggy and too spicy for our tastes. 3 of us ordered the $5.00 cocktails which were very very weak. Ok, don't panic it is called \" pizza Rock\", so let's wait to fully judge until we have the pizza. One of our friends ordered the Caesar salad. She enjoyed it and it had the wonderful white anchovies. Another friend enjoyed the spaghetti with meatballs. Now my wife and I were quite excited for the pizza to arrive. We had ordered the \" chicago style \" meat pizza. The description said it had a thin crust, which surprised my wife and I because we have been to Chicago many times and \" chicago style\" pizza that we have always enjoyed is a deep dish pizza, but we were game and ready to try their interpretation of \" chicago style\" pizza. My wife and I have had pizza all over the world, and without a doubt, this was the WORST pizza we have ever had. The crust was very similar in consistency to a dry saltine cracker. Very sparse cheese and even more limited meat. The total bill with tip came to just over $100.00 so the food wasn't bargain priced. The awful pizza was $23.00.  Will not be going back. Pizza rock....sank.",

This location on the other hand was a horrible Father's Day Dining experience... We waited 20-30minutes to get served water at 2:45 pm. We specifically asked  for our NY style thin crust to be cooked lightly not burned at all!! The pizza came out burned loaded with sauce and no mozzarella cheese.. My GF complained and the manager said it was impossible to lightly cook the pizza with that crust type... Yet my son sitting right next to me had same pizza cooked perfectly.. The Moscow Mule was terrible and the manager came back and said they would cook us a new pizza and not charge us.. Well the second pizza was miraculously and shockingly cooked perfectly.. Manager said we would NOT be charged yet we were charged for both pizzas and were given total without itemized bill... We were there for 2 hrs  for pizza and salads!! Stay far away from this pizza place!!",

    "text": "This was our first visit to pizza rock. We visited the GVR location and my husband and I were beyond excited as we have heard so many great things about the place. We made reservations which I recommended as they get super busy. Once we were seated the server came by quite quickly to get our drinks order and we order the meatballs as an appetizer. The meatballs were amazing. Next we order the Margherita Pizza which I was especially excited about and the sausage and peppers. My husband and I were planning on sharing the dishes s that we can get a taste of different things. As we placed the order our waitress pointed out that the pizza will be out before the sausage and the peppers as it only takes 6 minutes to make. We were more than ok with that since we were sharing. Well the sausage and the peppers arrived, which we thought was interesting since the comment previous about the pizza. The waitress came by and asked any thing we can get for you, I had asked about our pizza and she is like oh yes he is very behind. Ok we understand but the problem was that when the pizza came out it wasn't even hot and they use to are sauce instead of fresh tomatoes which was kind of disappointing in the Margherita pizza.  It was an ok experience. We may or may not be back. Haven't decided yet.",
