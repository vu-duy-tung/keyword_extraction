I'm used to official chinese food all over the world.... (people knock Mr. Chows, but besides the price, it's consistent and delicious) but I'm really used to eating such great chinese food from Monterey Park, well this is that, but presented so much nicer and the food is top notch. I see the top chefs from all the 5 star restaurants inside the wynn eat there at random hours and they don't trip on how you dress. the food is a little expensive, but I don't care. the salt and pepper chilean sea bass is amazing!!! I have had almost everything on their menu and they're just so consistent and always good. I never miss at least one meal there whenever I go",

The food is usually quick so if you are planning to do casual dining and is in a impatient mood go to Red 8.  My favorite by far is the Chilean sea bass in a light soy base sauce with thinly sliced green onions.  The dim sums during breakfast and brunch is great. I believed we've ordered and tried everything on their menu and some were good, not so good, and bad.  The service is average. There decor is quite unique and RED.  I mainly go there for the Chilean sea bass.",

We had the duck, dumplings, pad thai with chicken, crab rangoon, and soft shelled crab. Everything was well cooked and tasted as expected. The pad thai was excellent. Crab rangoon is always a favorite comfort food! :)",

The hostesses are always friendly and walk you themselves to the table. The foods impeccable. We always get the shrimp Chow Mein ($24) and and tried the Sweet and Sour Chicken tonight ($19). Both dishes were so delicious. The Chow Mein does only have 4 shrimp but it's Vegas so that's expected. The Sweet and Sour Chicken is plentiful and so good. The soft drinks are $4. This particular night we didn't have the best waiter but usually they are very attentive and helpful. I would definitely recommend this restaurant when you come to Vegas. It is totally worth the price.",

But, like everyone else we encountered at Wynn, the people were very friendly.  The veggie spring rolls were fried, which turned the insides to mush.  They came with a very brown sauce, which tasted like brown.  We shared the Mongolian beef, which I really liked.  It had a nice kick to it which my \"no spicy!\" wife was able to tolerate.  Service was friendly, but the spring rolls came out after the entree.  One appetizer, one entree, and two soft drinks set us back $48, including tip.  I wouldn't call this a great value for the money.",

    "text": "We needed something quick for dinner prior to our 7pm showing at La Reve.  As we walked around Wynn looking at the different restaurants, the host at Stratta suggested Red 8.  Red 8 is a pan-asian restaurant.  The dramatic interior/exterior makes up for its quiet-like setting.  We were seated right away with no wait which was nice.  Our picks for dinner:  mongolian beef, ma po tofu (spicy minced pork and soft bean curd), and salted fish fried rice with chicken.  For drinks I ordered the thai iced tea.  We made a comment to our waiter that we were kind of in a rush for La Reve which he understood.  We had about 45 minutes to eat.  As we waited for our food I glanced at the decor.  Lots of red and dark wood surroundings.  I thought they did a great job designing the place.  The dishes arrived fairly quickly that I was impressed.  So quick that I kind of felt bad for the couple who was there prior to our arrival whose dishes hadn't arrived.  The dishes we ordered were well prepared and very tasty.    The mongolian beef was very tender.  The ma po tofu was great except for the minced pork which I thought was unusual.  It was minced yet they had some thin slices of pork in it but I still liked it regardless, and the tofu was fresh.  The chinese spices made it a wonderful dish.  The salted fish fried rice with chicken was fantastic.  It had the perfect salted fish-rice-chicken ratio.  Our meal was executed well along with their attention to detail and service.    Not considered fine dining here but I really enjoyed it.  The menu is a little pricey but you get what you pay for and honestly I think you can't go wrong eating at any of the Wynn restaurants.",

    "text": "The Chinese believe that the number 8 is good luck representing prosperity. The color red also represents power and fortune. OK the True story behind Red 8 is that only certain dishes are amazing and the rest are average Chinese food. If this restaurant were a little cheaper and located somewhere other than the Wynn, I would rave. But it is in the Wynn and people (I'm people) expect a lot. I've eaten here twice, the first time I got something simple like Sesame Chicken or something. It was good but nothing amazing. Just the chicken in the sauce on the rice. You could've gotten the same at P.F. Chang's.  However, the second time I went I said screw this. My co-workers kept talking about how good the place was so I'm like ok let's give this place a real try. I ordered the jellyfish appetizer. DELICIOUS! Best I've had. Try it, it's not as scary as it sounds. Jellyfish is awesome and they make the best. Second, I had the seabass. It was pan fried in like a tempura bredding but spicy like it sat with some jalapenos for a while. Great. I love seabass and this is some of the best I've had. The difference was night and day. I guess the key to this place is order the most expensive thing on the menu. Actually I think someone at my table said they do that everywhere they go. How retarded! But I guess in some cases it works. Like misplaced little Chinese eateries. Also, too much red and black decor. I started to feel like I was in a Samuri movie.",

When my wife and I went there, they sat us at a table right next to a table where someone just threw up.  They had a cleaning crew there spraying an obnoxious disinfectant, which was quite unpleasant for the people nearby trying to eat.  They started cleaning before we got our meal, so we asked to get moved, which they did.  They apologized many times, but it was pretty tacky to try and sit people near a table where someone just threw up.",

    "text": "I must have been extremely lucky OR Red 8 read the previous reviews and improved on their service.  After seeing Spamalot at the Wynn, my friend's and I were starving.  With no reservation, we only waited about 30 minutes for a table.  Not bad considering it was Saturday night right before the clubbing hour.    The food was pretty good ... and I'm Chinese.  So I've had all sorts of Chinese food.  From cheap to ridiculously expensive.  From street vendor to exclusive VIP.  I really enjoyed it.   You can tell that an actual Chinese person prepared the meal and menu versus PF Chang's where it's Caucasian owned and run.    We started with the char siu bao, pot stickers and cold cucumber salad.  Both were prepared to perfection.  Everyone at the table had different cravings and decided to not share. I had something more traditional, beef brisket noodle soup.  They used really good meat and it was well marinated.  Since I've been a kid, I've been to scared to eat the tendons, but that is suppose to be the best part of the meal.  And they had good portions of the beef and tendons, both very fresh and tasty!  The broth is also what makes the meal, it was very tasty and not oily like in most cheap Chinese restaurants.   Yes, the meal was more expensive than what I'm used to spending for a bowl of noodles, but hey, we were in Vegas at the Wynn....and it was tasty!  It's more important that I enjoy what I eat.   I'd be silly to think that it would actually be cheap at the Wynn versus a hole in the wall in Monterey Park. I'd definitely go back.",

I thought it would be more expensive since it was in the Wynn... but it was still pricey for what it was.  For example  the $9 hot and sour soup ended up being an appetizer for one.

Ambiance was semi-dressy and the food seemed more or less like a glorified Panda Express.  - Shiu Mai - Pork and Shrimp Dumplings  - Mongolian Beef  - Assorted BBQ Platter (Marinated Chicken, Roasted Duck, BBQ Pork) - Braised E-Fu Noodles - Combination Fried Rice  The Shiu Mai, mongolian beef and combination fried rice was the most appealing of our entire orders. Shiu Mai was the one that solely hit the spot. If it were not that expensive for 4 pcs, I'd ordered numerous orders of dim sum for the remainder of the night as my dinner. The mongolian beef and combination friend rice almost suppresed our hunger.   The biggest disappointment was the Braised E-Fu Noodles which lacked any flavor and was just short of any enjoyment.  Overall, we paid a hefty bill in our attempt to suppress our hunger this night. I'd give this place a whirl if you are staying at the Wynn but not worth a cab fare, drive, or walk to eat at this place.",

When I ask if my order is ready, she shouted at me?!  And the reason she yelled at me is \"I'm too busy\". Then I ask her to apologize, she did but then ask her manager to tell me she's pregnant(well I don't know if it's True since I'm not an X-ray)  I know a pregnant is innocent and tough, but can u yell at others who you not even know as a \"pregnant \"? I wondering will you tell your customers u r still a pregnant after u yell at them in 1 year.",

Was hoping to be wowed by the food because it's a Wynn restaurant with Wynn prices but apparently they're not above fleecing people with marginally average food for exorbitant prices like all the other joints on the strip (*sigh*).   The Hong Kong seafood was just ok. The crispy noodles did not stand a fighting chance against the gelatinous sauce covering a very dull trio of seafood. The flavorless calamari was oddly cut in big slabs. Bland scallops and slightly less indifferent shrimp made up the remaining medley which after about 10 minutes became a congealed soggy unappetizing mess.   My friend had the Mongolian beef which she rated a solid 3 stars.   Chinese broccoli in sauteed garlic was delicious.   The dirty vodka martini was excellent and deserves 5 stars on it's own (just sayin').",

And when I say clearly I mean you can walk around this place and see everything so... You lied.... And you did it just to be rude... it was clear. The two stars are only being given because you offer vegan food and I feel that is a step in the right direction.

I know I shouldn't have expected much from a Chinese restaurant in a casino, but I took my chances anyway.  I had their special dumplings with noodles in soup and my husband had the Taiwanese beef noodles.  Both dishes were incredibly bland with no seasoning whatsoever.  I had to load up my soup with soy sauce just to make it palatable (something I never do in an Asian restaurant).  Lunch for 2 was about $35 pre-tip with no beverages or appetizers.  Service was also painfully slow, even though there were only 3 other tables in the restaurant with plenty of waitstaff.  I've eaten at the noodle place in the Bellagio, which is similarly priced and so much better.  Would not recommend - you're probably better off just ordering room service, getting fast food or going somewhere else on the strip.",

We ordered the roasted duck, which was small, but for a good amount, it was really delicious. Cooked to perfection, no burnt tasting flavors, and the sauce that came with it was absolutely magnificent to our taste buds. We also ordered some Curry-rice noodles with pork and veggies (signature dish). Hint of spicy, but it was awesome pair with our steamed vegetables.  Great food, service, and decent price. I would want to go here again, and possibly try other signature dishes too. The place has a very Asian theme to it. Nicely decorated & some fine Ming porcelains.",

    "text": "Definitely overpriced, but what isn't at the Wynn? The food itself is good, the dim sum especially. What I like about Red 8 is you can expect each dish to be made with quality ingredients and prepared in a \"Grade A\" environment. I've been to dim sum places around town that make my tummy cringe in fear; however, at Red 8, these fears are gone.   Wondering why the restaurant is named Red 8? Well, once you go there, you'll know why. From the red walls to the red place mats to the red roses, there's a lot of red going on. I'm sure there's a lot of Feng shui going on as well, as Steve Wynn opened Red 8 to cater specifically to the Asian clientele visiting the casino (I think I learned that from a Wynn video that plays on repeat on the room TVs).   Our server was friendly and helpful in choosing the best dim sum to order: Shrimp Har Gow- 4 pieces Pork Dumplings- 3 pieces, The dumplings were bursting with flavor and juice Steamed BBQ Pork Buns- Soft, pillowy buns filled with sweet BBQ pork  We also ordered two Red 8 Signature Dishes: Combination Fried Rice- Shrimp, chicken, beef.  A Pan-Fried Noodle Dish- Wide rice noodles and tender pieces of beef pan-fried in soya sauce  I enjoyed all the dim sum, especially when dipped in the vinegar and mustard. However, for the main dishes, I preferred the noodles over the fried rice. In conclusion, the food was good and the service was nice. If price wasn't a factor, I would go back again to try their other dim sum choices.",

    "text": "During a stay at the Wynn, my family wanted a quick and casual meal on the property without breaking the bank.  We had youngsters and our parents weren't in the mood for \"fine\" dining, so we decided to try a \"family style\" meal at the Red 8 Restaurant.  We had 8 people in our group: 3 senior citizens, a couple of young adults and younger ones.    Upon entering the restaurant, I immediately noticed how quiet things were.  Aside from another small group that came in close to when we were trying to leave, the restaurant was completely empty.  I actually like when things are quiet because the service is usually better, but it was not so at the Red 8.  We were the ONLY guests in the restaurant but they managed to ignore us for long stretches and disappear to the back.  They took our order and brought out the food...and that was basically all we saw of our waitperson.  Of course, this meant that we had to wait a ridiculous amount of time to get our bill and pay for it, not to mention empty glasses and a bunch of unsatisfied family members, but bad restaurant experiences happen, right?  Before I get to the food, I should say a few words about the restaurant.  It was red, clean, modern, didn't look like your typical Chinese restaurant (but the Wynn isn't trying to give you the typical), and was very dark.  Our parents couldn't see anything, but I can see how they might have been trying to create an intimate or romantic ambiance with the dim lighting.  It really didn't do anything for me, but I can see how some people might like it or be impressed.  You know what they say about dim restaurants - it's dark so you can't see the food.  I have only been here once because I do not have a reason to return despite my numerous stays at the Wynn.  Your experience may be different, hopefully better than mine, though I'm not sure if I'd even take a chance considering the plentiful options and my overall experience at the Red 8.  Basically, the food is very similar to what you would find at a Panda Express.  I know it sounds like an unreasonably low-blow, but if you've eaten here, you'd probably agree with my assessment.  I realize the Red 8 tries to dress up the dishes with ingredients or better cuts of meat, but the taste, presentation, and even the portions seemed to come straight from a carryout container from Panda Express.  I have had my share of fancy Chinese restaurants/banquets, and the Red 8 isn't even in the same class as a P.F. Chang's, which is terribly disappointing considering my high opinion of the Wynn Resort.    Our total bill came out to about $300 with tip.  It was the worst meal I've had on the Wynn Property, and probably one of the worst overall dining experiences I've had in Vegas.  I'm not sure what's more annoying: paying premium prices for inferior food or the terrible service - that's why I cannot give this place a recommendation.  The Wynn could \"comp\" my meal during my next visit, and I'd still pass because I'm not in Vegas to take a chance on my entertainment/food.  I'll gamble at the tables, but not with my meal.    In my opinion, the Red 8 Restaurant seems more like a tourist trap for Asian guests at the Wynn than an actual restaurant - if you know what I mean.  Try the Lemongrass Restaurant at Aria or go straight to Panda Express - but avoid the Red 8.",

The BEST PART? Why the Five stars?  VEGAN DIM SUM!!! and MOUTH WATERING stuff!!!! We had the gardein chick'n shu mai and the lotus dumpling ( mushroom and spinach) I literally made orgasm noises when i was eating this stuff, i couldn't help it. When i went vegetarian 7 years ago, I never thought I'd get to set the dim sum of my childhood again, but red 8 did it for me. It was to die for...seriously. After i ate it, i ordered more to go.  We also ate the brown veggie friend rice, and the vegan chicken lettuce wraps. amazing....! If you're vegan or vegetarian, and in vegas and looking for a NICE meal out ( between $70-$100 after tip if you get 2 entrees and an appetizer and a couple drinks) then GO to red 8!!!",

    "text": "The interior presentation and overall experience in general were impressive, but for the steep price we paid, the food and service left much to be desired.   In terms of food, the dishes were good but lacking any flavor to really set them apart from typical Westernized Chinese cuisine. The Mapo Tofu dish in particular could have used more heat and flavor, a flavor that I expected since the dish originates in my mom's hometown but didn't get. I did like the soft, tender texture of the beef dishes we ordered though, and the Malaysian Chicken Satay was excellent. The dim sum dishes we ordered were not anything extraordinary to me; I've definitely had better soup dumplings elsewhere.  Service was very average and a little bit on the slow side. While the overall experience definitely wasn't negative, it was overpriced, and I don't think I'd return considering its value.",

Even though the prices are extravagant, the ambiance at the lovely Wynn Resort and, in particular, this Asian eatery is stunning.  Very small/cozy space with lots of wealthy Chinese tourists who clearly know good taste.  The service was friendly enough from Dorothy but it can border on uptight, which can feel a bit like you're being snubbed.  They will have to be careful not to project that onto their customers.  It's a good place to go for a little snack to tide you over before your restaurant reservation elsewhere.",

We had the Cha Shao Boa, the Siu Mai, the deep fried shrimp in tofu skin.   We also had pig knuckle noodle soup and pumpkin cake for dessert.   I loved it all.     It is pricey compared to most dim sum in the Bay Area.   But to me,  it's worth it.  Good service, good food, good atmosphere and a great pot of dragon hot tea.   Life is good!!",

    "text": "I was in good spirits and decided to eat here to celebrate my wife's birthday and was surprised at how the dinner turned out. For a restaurant inside of the Wynn Hotel, I expected quality and standards to be fairly up there. Unfortunately, it didn't meet that expectation.  The decor is a nice Chinese style feel with a hint of high-end elegance and a splash of modern attitude.  Staff was very friendly and attentive. Everywhere you looked, you were sure to spot a staff member ready to help you. Not sure what happened, but this changed as soon as the food was delivered.   Once we got our food, it was almost impossible to find a staff member. Once we finally got one, I asked for some condiments (chili oil, soy sauce, etc). After 10 mins, I still didn't get any condiments. It took so long that my food got cold. I had to be that loud/rude customer and call out to a staff member that I requested certain stuff and that my food is now cold. I demanded that they take my food back, cook up another order and not reheat it, and provide me with the condiments I initially requested. They took the food back, delivered the hot chili oil (still didn't give us soy sauce), and 8 mins later, delivered a new HOT order of my dish.  Though they did make up for their mess up, the fact that everyone else was now just sitting around & waiting for me to finish was a bit annoying. Luckily, for them, my wife enjoyed her food... aside from not getting the soy sauce she wanted.  We ordered the following: 1) Fried rice - pretty good, but a bit bland. (Soy sauce advised) 2) Har gow - my wife loved it. Flavorful and  3) Dan Dan Noodles - Not really traditional.  Pretty tasty, but not as spicy as I'm used to. If you do order this, I suggest getting a side of hot chili oil and adding it to your taste. Just hope they get it to you before the noodles get cold. 4) Wonton Noodle Soup - This is probably the closest to flavor I'm familiar with. If you've had good wonton noodle soup else where, this will be very familiar to you too.  Overall, the food was okay. Not any better than any other chinese restaurant. If it wasn't for the fact that serving staff practically forgot us and my food got cold, it would've been an okay experience. Because I had to send back my order and wait twice as long to eat, this just made the whole experience simply bad.  I would give this place another go, but only of this was the only chinese restaurant open.",

Every dish that I had was enjoyable and slightly different from the mainstream versions. The chicken lettuce cups (basic I know) were light and flavorful. The spicy pork with bell peppers was decent; everything I expected and nothing that I didn't. But the deep fried chicken with chili sauce absolutely made the meal for me. The sour/spicy flavor balanced well with the light/crispy crust of the chicken. Highly recommend this dish.  Overall the meal was good. Don't come into the meal with the highest of expectations or shallow pockets and you will come out of it happy.",

We had to pour a good amount of soy sauce to make it edible. The very high price bottle of wine we ordered wasn't good either. I can only imagine it was a overpriced cheap wine. Never going back there again. Unhealthy, bland, overpriced food.",

I don't normally like eating pork belly because it's very fatty, but I did it.  The flavor was perfect.  The choy sum stir fried with garlic was delicious, even my daughter enjoyed it.  I also ordered the prawns with eggs, knowing that I can't go wrong since my kid loves eggs. The prawns are giant looking...   The wait staff was super friendly and the ambiance was worth the price I paid for.  We had to wait but it was worth it.  I asked the hostess if she can get a chair for my daughter, since she can't sit in the gaming area.   I will definitely come back when we visit in the future.",

On a lark, we changed our plans to go for Italian and instead came here to see how it was. I will admit, part of the allure was their fake chicken options on the menu!  We didn't make reservations but were able to get a table right away. We ordered two appetizers (Ginger String Beans and Jade Dumplings), and entrees consisted of Dan Dan Noodles and Cashew Chik'n. There was a good amount of food and every bit we had was ~*delicious*~. Our server was quick and polite and was able to answer any questions we had.  I was sad the Hot and Sour soup had a chicken base for the broth, as I would have loved to have a bowl of it.   Highly recommended if you're craving Chinese food!",

The 2nd time we came for late night dining and the service was ok. The 3rd time we came it was dinner time, the restaurant was only half full but we waited 10 minutes for our waiter. That should've been a sign to leave but I enjoy the food so much, I wanted to stay. After our food was delivered - tasty black pepper beef tenderloin and shrimp with eggs- we never saw our waiter again. He never checked in us to see how the food was. I had to flag people down to get some chili paste. For $100 meal, you should be receiving top notch service. No matter how good the food is - service matters. Can't say I'll be back.",

We ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, and some noodle I can't even remember.  Neither was spectacular.  The seabass was breaded and had the taste and texture of cod.  It tasted so cod-like that I even had to wave the waiter down and ask if the Gordon Fisherman baked this shit.  I have never had a piece of seabass that flaked like cod.  It typically is more fibrous like soft scallops than overcooked cod.  Skip this place if you can.  They charge $7 for tea here.",

The tomato egg sauce with Taiwan noodles was acceptable but is still overpriced at $18.  If you want world class dim sum, go to Ping Pang Pong at the Gold Coast casino where the local Chinese go.

There was even a chili pepper next to it to mark it as spicy. I *adore* a nice bowl of Dan Dan noodles, so I was looking forward to this. When I ordered it, the waiter asked, \"have you had this before? \" because he wanted to be sure I knew it was spicy. I assured him I've had it many times. Total let down.  A teaspoon of chili paste sitting on top of the noodles was the *only* bit of spicy. No chili oil? Not even the mince pork had any heat. The broth was basically dish water. Zero depth of flavor.  I asked the waiter for more chili paste. I think he sensed my disappointment because he gave me like three tablespoons' worth. I used probably half of it to get any semblance of heat. So yeah, if you like really Americanized Chinese, maybe this place will work for you.",

But just because I'm not too hungry, i feel a bit of condescension from the server as she doesnt even greet me upon arrival at the table or even say \"okay\" to confirm my drink order but walks away with a stench I don't like. So what if I'm not hungry, I came in for drinks, and if I decide later on to order food, so be it. However as soon as I mentioned that I only wanted to do cocktails, the server's attitude changed.  I hope one of the managers reads this soon. I'm having the mandarin mojito, black tea, and some dim sum. I understand quality can take time, but this felt like negligence rather than anything else from the server. she never smiled, and i never felt accommodated. I expect nothing less than excellence in service from such a fine establishment that prides its service, setting, and luxury.   The hostess was the young female with the short hair, and she was cheerful and welcoming towards me to come on in and try the place. I mentioned to her I felt like having a cocktail and she gladly went over the drink menu with me and recommended the mandarin mojito. I really think she did better than my server, and I feel she was the only pleasant part of my whole experience here. I dine at fine establishments all the time, and when in Vegas, it is what I look forward to. This is the exact opposite of what I would expect, especially at the Wynn.  ps- Miss Tina, I had left a card for you with my name. I wanted to make sure you were aware of this.

Started with the pan-fried turnip cake which lost miserably to what my mommy makes. I had the pork belly which made the waiter pause uncertainly and warn me that \"it's very rich and fatty.\" DUH, that's the POINT. It was good but I've had better for cheaper. Also, I thought there would be more of it. Sorry, I'm a fat kid. Or at least a greedy kid. My dining partner had the chilean sea bass which was really ... not that good; I think it was tad overcooked which is just bad form.

So if I'm going to pay $20 an entree, I might as well get some decent Chinese food.  The decor is Asian themed and pretty cool.  It's super convenient for those who are gambling or for those like me that are staying at the Wynn and don't want to wander off the resort to grab a meal.  Service was also pretty good for a Vegas restaurant.  Ok let's get to the food.  I ordered Mongolian Beef and Roasted Duck and a bowl of white rice.  They were extremely generous with the amount of beef in the Mongolian beef dish, like there was a lot!  I was impressed.  And their roasted duck was very meaty and crispy.  I was expecting subpar duck but it passed the test.  So overall, it was a pretty good meal.  Let's not talk about value cause there is no value to be had eating on premises of any of the big casinos.

The onions were sharp. This was barely a step up from food court Chinese. The cocktail I wanted was $22 so I didn't order it. When paying this for a meal one expects service but what we got was ignored. One drink was refilled and we sat at the table 20 minutes after we had finished eating & arranged our utensils in the empty dishes before spotting our waiter again and requesting the check.  The restaurant was attractive from the outside but our table was in a plain corner so I didn't even get a decent selfie out of it. The food on the plates wasn't photo worthy so I didn't bother. Don't waste your dining dollars here.",

And mind you, probably ate the lowest priced entrees on the menu, or darn near the bottom. Not from cheapness, I like those items (well, LIKED.) Waited 40 minutes when told about a 20-25 minute wait. They dont take reservations and are a bit disorganized in that dept. Service was attentive, just disappointed quality of items has gone downhill (add to the list in this city) If you love panda express then this place will flip your untasty noodle.",

    "text": "Steve Wynn, you should be ashamed that you let people put this crap in peoples' mouths.   Where to start... It's Christmas and like tradition we had to get Chinese food. We've been to Wazuzu before and love it, but tried Red 8 as a change of pace.  Positively, we were able to call from our room to put our name on the 1.5 hour waitlist (no reservations). We came down an hour later and were seated 10 min after that.   It just went downhill from there. We asked our waiter how big the portions were, and his reply was \"a good size.\" Wtf. I said \"this big?\" (Gesturing with my hands) or \"this big?\" (Gesturing with my hands)... \"Yeah, that big,\" he said. Thanks for the non-clarification.   We also wanted to order one of the specialty \"Wynn Macau\" noodles, but with chicken instead of pork. We were told that wasn't allowed, as the soups are \"pre-made.\" That should've been sign #1.   We ended up ordering the following: -Pork wontons in chili oil: pork had NO taste, and even if it did, the overly spicy and oily sauce would way overpower it anyway disgusting.  -Marinated chicken with supreme soy sauce: this was kind of like Peking duck, but chicken and way more disgusting. And cold (remember: everything is premade). The chicken was kind of fatty, which is ok because of the style they were going for, but it had no taste whatsoever.  -noodles with beef in soya sauce: noodles were crispy, but the sauce had no taste. Beef was also cold and stringy and was of poor quality.   The guys sitting next to us got their food and were staring at it. We looked over and started laughing. \"If the shrimp were any smaller they'd be dust mites,\" he told us.  Enough said.   all in all, this place is disgusting on all levels. Service and food. Now I'm from NY, so I know my Chinese food and this ain't it.   We'll be going back to Wazuzu tomorrow, but first we're having a real dinner. Hopefully our second dinner at Zooza Crackers is better.   NOTE: our table-neighbors told us about this great hidden pizza place in Cosmo. We'll check out that out tomorrow.",

I called a week before to let them know I'll be bringing in that group and surely it was promising. It was so disappointing because first of all Crystal the MOD was very unfriendly not helpful and very cold to us. My group was elderly so when we sat down some of them couldn't sit on the High Stool Chairs. Crystal did not do anything just let us figure out by ourselves. It took us a good fifteen minutes to sit down just to be comfortable. Then we have Joe out server took our order. After dinner he gave the check to one of group and as he said he could separate the check 4 ways. He left us alone let us figure out the check 3 ways. Then I ask for a manager again and still no help from her at All. I ask her to calculate the check by the numbers I've mark and surely no cares. I've told her that the service was Bad and had to ask for everything. She had let one server to take of party of 18 people and still took tables f on his section. To the Hotel Operations and Director of  Restaurants Crystal don't care about people how to give 5 star service. I've canceled a reservation at Anthony's just to come and eat at Red 8. Sorry but I have to give my rant because it bothers me any my church. They added gratuity of 18% and a tax fee for large parties. I don't mind if the service was great but no service at All. Crystal you need an assessment of how you take care of your guest. Anonymous. But I will be making a call to the Hotel operations and the FB Director.",

    "text": "I love staying at the Wynn.  I had been looking forward to eating here after running out of time on the last 3 stays. I was really underwhelmed. The Wynn has many other better options.  This is some of the least authentic Chinese food I have ever had.  The Panda Express at a shopping mall food court is more authentic than this.  The Dan Dan noodles was cheap ramen with a squirt of bottled Hosin sauce and Sriracha. This would be like ordering spaghetti marinara and getting ketchup for the tomato sauce.   The chicken satay was deep fried not grilled. Yuck., How do you think a sirloin steak would taste is you decided to deep fry it instead of putting it on a broiler.  Head over to the Encore side and try the asian restaurant there, it is way better.",

We got put in a corner area and my group felt neglected the whole time. The food took forever to come, the waiter came by and didn't even fill up our drinks we had to ask several times for more drinks. He also took forever to ask how our food was. We sat there waiting 15+ minutes after we were done eating for our waiter to come back so we could ask for our checks. We got sick of waiting and eventually got up and asked for our checks and the staff seemed irritated by that but we were sick of waiting for someone to show up. After asking for our checks we still waited 10+ minutes to even receive them and another 10 to get our cards back. We only had a group of 5, and were younger so maybe they thought they could neglect us and treat us like we weren't there. WORST WORST WORST service I've had, I get better service at the McDonald's drive through.",

This is one of my favorite restaurants but I had a bad experience here today- I have a severe allergy to onions and the waiter took the order correctly but the chef decided to cook my food with onions and what looks like tried to pick them out but they were still there. Long story short my throat started closing and I found a few of the onions in my beef hor fun. I requested for the manager to come so I could address the issue- was that a mistake. She looked at me like I was in the wrong and the waiter even said the kitchen made a mistake. Nonetheless she didn't apologize- nor try to remedy the issue, I hope they don't make this a common practice because I will stop coming here if this is the direction they are going to treat repeat clients.",

I mean...aside from everything in the vegetarian section of the menu being either a) already vegan or b) capable of altered to be vegan, they even had vegan dim sum!!! Dim sum is the thing I missed the most since going vegan tbh. This places is amazing. It's quite pricey, but I'd rather throw my money down here and eat a bunch of vegan dim sum to satisfy my cravings, rather than a giant Vegas buffet where I can eat like 4 things. They use a lot of gardein \"meats\" as dumpling filler and also for their \"chicken\" wraps. Really delicious!  The best part is, this restaurant has awesome noodles soups too, so my meat-eating family can enjoy a meal with me in the same place! My dad, who is just about the most judgmental eater in the world, genuinely liked their beef brisket soup with egg noodles. He raved about how satisfied he was and then got the fresh mango sago for dessert (which he also gobbled up in record time). Mom loved the wonton soup with egg noodles, and my husband got the stir fried noodles with beef, which he cleaned the plate of.  The only thing that was weak was the black sesame porridge. Definitely not sweet enough, which is a shame because it's one of my favorites! Service is meh, but we came for the food and we left quite satisfied!",

However, the prices are somewhat high for asian food, but not too high where it was ridiculous. The quality is definitely up their.  Egg rolls- skip it. It was wet and soggy inside. Orange chicken- Loved this dish. I would come back for it. Make sure you get this. Beef Chowfun- another solid dish rice- it's rice, you cannot mess this one up.

The service was excellent and the restaurant was clean and Tastefully decorated. Yes, it's on the expensive side but prices are in line with similar restaurants in the resorts, so don't let that deter you from visiting Red 8.

We decided to have dinner there and Red 8 seemed like a good option (and one of the more affordable ones). We went up to the host and asked for a table for 2 and were so surprised to hear that it was a 20 minute wait. The hotel was so quiet and empty! We played a few slots to kill some time and when we went back only 15 minutes later, we were seated right away ... in a half empty restaurant! That already had my eyes rolling and then the rest of the night seemed to drag. It took awhile to get our order placed, waited some more for the food to come out, our waiter seemed to disappear when we wanted our check and we had to ask 2 different people before it finally came. It just didn't have the service I'd expect from a nicer hotel. And I really don't know what they were trying to prove with the wait-time when the restaurant was half empty.  Now as for the food, I had the dan dan noodles with pork which was just OK. The portion could have been bigger (compared to my husband's similar-to-spicy-Thai basil noodles which was a large portion) and I barely had any pork.",

Red 8 is a nice place to eat that isn't too upscale or toocasual.  There's a lot of choices from dim sum, to various noodle and rice dishes and dumplings.  Red 8 serves pretty tasty Chinese food, better than some of the Chinese places at other hotels nearby.  My only downfall to the place was probably the wait time for the food.  I ordered a hot and sour soup, the portion was quite small.. I thought it was quite delicious but my mom thought it was too salty.  Next we had what was supposed to be the pork and shrimp dumplings..but I think they sent us pork dumplings ( I couldn't taste any shrimp in it).  The dumplings were steamed and were quite flavorful..although a bit rich, which is why I was wanting the shrimp and pork dumplings. It came in an order of 3, so after me and my mom each had one, I felt bad letting the waiter know the order was wrong.  We also ordered the Beef Hor Fun (in soy sauce) to share.  This was quite a large and filling portion with nice sized pieces of beef.  Lastly we had the Vegan Tofu Shiitake.  Pieces of tofu, veggie and shiitake mushrooms, exactly what I was craving for.  Everything was pretty good, I'm usually not a fan of Chinese food, but I thought that Red 8 had good variety, ambiance and Chinese fare.",

As a vegan it was so much fun to have choices. The waiter I had was an older gentleman and he truly brought me back to last trip to China. This was heavenly. I also had a nice tea with my dim sum. It was very laid back and took my time to enjoy my meal. The food was very very good. The server was very kind and he was very patient with other diners! I can't judge the price because as a Vegan this kind of options are rare so for me it was a lunch that was more than what I would usually choose money wise, but the level of the quality and presentation and taste was a real gem. In the end, it cost me around $40. But it was such a nice experience that I felt that it was worth it. Not every day, but surely every time I am in Vegas, I will go to have a lunch at Red 8.",

We took some gambles with unfamiliar menu items and our boldness paid off for the most part. I loved the pan-fried pumpkin dumplings, and the Bao were as good as what we eat on Sunday mornings in Monterrey Park. Noodle dishes were excellent and served very beautifully. This is an extensive menu requiring some leaps of faith and bit of the explorer's instinct. We got lucky and had a simply wonderful  meal.",

    "text": "I'm surprised to see these many Chinese eateries popped up in Vegas since my last visit in 2010. We wanted to try WING LEI in Wynn, however it was closed until late December, so we ended up here in Red 8.   It's a casual Chinese eatery offering traditional Chinese dishes with a little bit American twist. I liked the red themed decor which symbolized fortune in Chinese culture.  I ordered the Tofu Salty Fish pot and my wife ordered the Tomato Based Shrimp noodle soup. It's a smaller portion than what you might expect, but it is just the right size for us. The food is very well prepared. The jumbo shrimp is very sweet and has that crunchy bite only the freshest shrimp can bring. The tomato base soup is very rich and has a great aroma. The tofu is very smooth and delicate, and the overall flavor of my Tofu Salty Fish pot pairs very well with white rice.  I would recommend this place to anyone who is willing to try something different than the Vegas buffets and Steakhouses. For the price of one upscale buffet, two person would be experiencing great Chinese cuisine in a cozy and relaxed atmosphere.",

Don't get me wrong, it is by no means cheap but it isn't very expensive either.   The food is not extraordinary but good enough, even though one of the dishes was really salty.   Overall, there aren't many decently priced, nice places for Chinese food on the strip so Red 8 is a good option if Chinese is what you're looking for.",

    "text": "Ok i have to be honest I am shocked that this level of quality is served at a steve wynn resort. The meal was comped but seriously this place was horrible. Panda express would be an improvement over this place. The bill was 130 for one person for lunch. Of course i had leftovers to take to pops but I felt like he might feel as though I was trying to poison him. I ordered the cantonese pot stickers to start. You could do better in the frozen section at costco. Next up I opted for the upgraded beef dish which is served table side on a sizzling platter it was like pepper beef sirloin or something like that. Really boring dish no imagination. was funny when i was ordering the waiter suggests i upgrade even further to kobe beef,I said well you probably wont get the benefit if its covered in a sauce,he says I will,even though i had a 200 comp and would not have had to pay for it I didn't do it. I asked him how much would it cost ,he says let me look on the menu,after we look together he cant find it he estimates it to cost around 90 dollars,like i said it would have been comped but it seemed too egregious to me. Next I ordered the sweet and sour chicken,total crap again you could do much better at panda express or costco. And lastly I ordered a bbq pork and shrimp combo fried rice,this was the best dish of all and I suspect that it is served regularly at the CCDC on fried crap night. In conclusion im glad i had  the comp but i still had to tip for 20 bucks ,its not the servers fault so i always take care of them. The server was very nice actually. Steve must be losing his taste as well as his vision because anyone who would rate this anything but touristy garbage food is on the payroll.",

    "text": "Red 8 is easily my most favorite Chinese restaurant on the Vegas Strip. Although their prices might be a bit pricey, their signature dishes are amazing! My husband and I always love to order their Roasted Duck. Their duck meat is tender and they also provide sweet dipping sauce to complement the taste. You can easily finish the plate between two people. One of their signature dishes is Baby Bok Choy covered in Scallop Sauce. In real life, I do not like to eat scallop. But for some reason, their special scallop sauce brings out the best flavor in baby bok choy. It was so delicious that we finished the entire plate. I also like to order their Rice Congee with Pork and Preserved Egg. They serve it in a huge bowl, and it's enough for several servings.  My husband also ordered noodles from their special noodle menu. You can pick the noodle of your choice as well as the meat. He picked egg noodle with chicken and mushroom. It was very filling and delicious from what he told me. I always have a craving for Red 8 ever since the Wynn first opened up. It's definitely worth a visit if you feel like great Chinese on the Vegas Strip.",

Honestly, the food is pretty tasty. I got the clay pot with chicken, salted fish, minced pork, and tofu with rice. It had good flavoring to it and the tofu was quite silky. Costed me about $16. Not ridiculous, I'll admit. My husband ordered Dumpling Noodle Soup and it was about $15. Nothing extraordinary.   The service wasn't exceptional. They actually didn't seem to want to be there. I think they're just tired of all the snobbish visitors, honestly. So, we didn't feel the love there ;P.

I wanted to try one of them, Red 8 was the first one I passed while walking through the hotel, so I decided to try it.  I was thinking of either the lettuce wraps or the Gardein \"chicken\" with broccoli, carrots,celery and cashews in a ginger sauce.(actually I substituted the mushrooms for broccoli which they had no problem doing) The waiter told me the wraps are pretty small and more of an appetizer and to go with the other, so I did. It was very flavorful! I liked it a lot even though it was $18..they sell Gardein in Whole Foods and other health food stores, so it's not something they make on their own in the restaurant so it seems a bit pricey for it, but the food was really well cooked,the vegetables were so good and fresh. The waiter was very friendly too. I'd recommend coming here.",

Since this is my favorite vegetable (the hollow-heart vegetable) I always get that. On the menu it's labeled as \"wok-fried water spinach, preserved bean curd.\" So that's what you're looking for.  This most recent time I had the curried Singapore rice vermicelli with shredded pork, shrimp, egg, and bean sprouts, as well as the wok-fried chicken in black bean sauce. I always share family style with a coworker. The bill is always $70 something, and I always use the corporate credit card. It's one of the few \"casual dining\" options at Wynn, and still obscenely expensive. It's all relative I guess. This place is relatively shabby as far as Wynn dining options go, only because they do not provide complimentary royal princesses from third-world vassal countries to massage your hands with slightly heated polished rubies every time you have to strain your fingers by cleaning your pasty pasty mouth with a wetnap made of a thousand dollar bill infused with a mixture of 1938 Clos du Mesnil champagne and the sweat of a virgin king cobra. If you look at it that way, this place is a shithole.  I will continue to eat here anytime I get the chance.",

    "text": "Red 8 is Wynn's informal Asian restaurant, open for lunch and dinner.  It serves a variety of Southeast Asian foods: Malaysian satays, Japanese noodles, Cantonese noodles and, on weekends, Hong Kong style dim sum.  Wynn Las Vegas has an array of excellent restaurants - all of them expensive.  Red 8 tries to fill a niche by providing good food at a modest price, relatively speaking.  Many dishes are in the $15 - $20 range, although there are a few luxury live seafood items that will set you back almost $100.  The breadth of the menu is surprising.  Among its offerings are Malaysian beef satays, Korean kim chee, Japanese udon noodles, Vietnamese pho, pad Thai, Indian mee goreng noodles, and Cantonese roast duck.  There's a single menu for lunch and dinner.  The restaurant is decorated in black, white and cream, with red accents.  Considering its location next to the casino, it's fairly quiet, with an informal feel.  There's a small communal table, but it doesn't seem very, well...communal.  I haven't noticed any conversations between strangers, and management doesn't help when it treats the table as overflow space when no other tables are available.  Service is a weak link at Red 8.  On my first visit, after I was finished eating, my server disappeared.  I waited for 15 minutes (actually a little bit longer than that, as I didn't check my watch right away), looking around for someone.  I finally managed to flag down a bus boy, and asked him to get my server.  She appeared a couple of minutes later, with no explanation.  On my second visit, service was better, but again there were some long waits.  On my third visit, I imitated a gentleman at a neighboring table who took a more direct approach: loudly hailing the server like a passing taxicab.  Crude, but effective.  ** DIM SUM Dim Sum is available for lunch on weekends.  There are no rolling carts; ordering is from a menu.  Each order comes as two or three pieces, so it would be more fun to order as a group, but ordering solo worked out OK.  It took a little while to prepare the food, but the wait wasn't too long.  I had: *   Shrimp in bean curd rolls.  Like a flat, fried egg roll, it was filled with shrimp, what tasted like shrimp paste, and bits of carrot and some green vegetable.  A dipping bowl contained Worcestershire sauce.  If you like bean curd skin, it's a very tasty dish. *   Deep fried taro dumplings.  Light and crispy outside, with soft (mashed?) taro inside, mixed with barbecue pork.  Very good+. *   Sticky rice in lotus leaf.  A rectangle of soft, sticky rice, with small shrimp and barbecued pork, wrapped in a lotus leaf. *   Thai ice tea.  Layered cream (?) on top of very sweet strong tea.  I liked it, but some people might have been turned off by the sweetness.  ** REGULAR MEAL #1 This time, I decided to try something different: *   Oriental green onion pancake.  Vaguely reminiscent of a quesadilla with scallions, but crispier.  Hoisin sauce was served as a condiment.  It didn't have much flavor; the hoisin sauce helped a little, but not much. *   Indian mee goreng with shrimp.  Wok-fried noodles, with onion and shrimp, and bits of a very hot pepper.  The portion was very large, probably best shared.  I thought the flavor was good, and the noodles were firm, but it was mostly just a big plate of noodles.  ** REGULAR MEAL #2 OK, maybe this doesn't exactly qualify as a regular meal.  However, I noticed a couple of interesting items on the menu, and was hooked.  What seemed so interesting?  Congee.  A thin rice porridge, it's felt to be a healthy dish, appropriate after one has been eating or drinking too well for a few days.  Kind of like thin oatmeal.  However, meat, chicken, fish, and other ingredients may be added to congee.  I chose to add pork and preserved egg.  The egg, sometimes called century egg or thousand year egg, is preserved in an alkaline solution.  Wikipedia has a good explanation.   The verdict?  Not bad.  As expected, it was pretty bland, but it actually had a little texture.  The pork gave it some flavor, and the preserved egg was interesting.  I don't know if I'd order it again, but I'm glad I tried it once.  I had planned to try an unusual dessert - sweet potato porridge with sago - but the huge bowl of congee had filled me up.  Maybe next time.  Red 8 isn't bad, but it also isn't that good.  Perhaps its menu is too ambitious (\"Jack of all trades, master of none\").  Perhaps I've been spoiled by all the excellent restaurants at Wynn.  In any case, I was hoping for better.  Nonetheless, it's convenient and not too expensive - and I don't know if there's any place better in this mid-range category.",

I was hungry and decided to give it a try. When I first saw the menu it had chinese characters so I thought to myself, 'ok maybe it won't be so bad'. For drinks I got the Thai Ice Tea (FYI, it was $5) which was too sweet. We ordered the crab yee mein and the braised beef stew. It was very delicious and most importantly authentic. The food tasted just like the ones you would find in San Gabriel, Alhambra, etc... However, being in Vegas the prices are different. For desert we had mango sago which paked a lot of mango flavor as well as mango pieces. Everything was really delicious.",

The servers pretty much only came out when they were needed, but they were easy to flag down to get what you needed. My only big gripe is that the dim sum selection is a bit smaller than you would expect at a Chinese restaurant. However, the two items that shine for me are the fresh guava juice (Yum! Definitely not Kern's nectar) and the egg custard buns. The pricing is a bit above average, but this is Vegas... and it's the Wynn. Show me a restaurant in a Vegas hotel/casino that isn't priced above your local Chinatown dim sum joint.",

Located right next to my favorite group of slot machines in the high roller section it features some of the most amazing Asian food you will ever taste.  For some reason, I never wanted to try the place because it just seemed like a filler restaurant that was just there to be there... but no! This place is legit as can be. We are coming to Vegas next weekend and I can't wait to go back.   I only tried a few things but next time I will order like double the amount just so I can experience a little more. I would tell you what I tried but honestly don't remember the names. I can only imagine whatever you order will be amazing because I was really impressed. My wife also loved it and she is a tough customer.   Try it out, you won't be disappointed!",

It was a Saturday and was very busy for the lunch hour.   They have a nice dim sum menu along with several entrees. We started with the bbq pork buns and steamed shiu mai. Both came out quickly and were hot. The pork buns were okay, but I have had much better. The shiu mai were good, but didn't seem made fresh in house.   We also ordered the Shanghainese soup dumplings (3). We felt the same about these, they were good but we have definitely had better. We finished with chicken and broccoli which they made special for us and fried rice. The chicken and broccoli came out luke warm but the fried rice was excellent. For a $100 lunch I would expect much better food.   I saw many reviews complaining about the service but we had excellent service from Joanna and Dorothy throughout the meal. They were very friendly and constantly checked on us and made sure our drinks were full.   3.5 stars for the food 5 stars for service",

Honey Glazed Prawns were massive and tasty!  Also had the combo fried rice and Cashew Chicken.  Definitely a do again.  We realized too late that we had not ordered anything spicy...will do that next time.    Service was way fast...almost too fast.  Literally like 3 minutes after ordering all the food arrived.  I was hungry but that's a bit quick.  Didnt get to fully enjoy the Ginger Green Bean appetizer.   Frankly the downer of the place are the seats.  They are child size patio chairs and neither my hubby or I were comfortable.  Our waiter quickly moved us to a bench seat but we saw other diners equally as uncomfortable.  We aren't skinny minis but we aren't huge either.  Kind-of average.  I imagine this is a problem for many people.  Took longer to get the check than the food.  :-(",

Setting: Very nice and Asianish as in they have a lot of statues of budas and what not. Very Asian detailing on the walls and plates and the colors were RED (obvious from the name) and black.

Girlfriends and I were craving a break from the steakhouse regimen that is Vegas and came here courtesy rec from the concierge at Encore, where we were staying.  Must-order: Shanghai xiao long bao were well-made, delicate skin still preserving the dumpling broth inside, which was flavorful. Most US establishments (minus Ding Tai Fung and authentic dimsum houses in LA/SF/NY/Vancouver) can't make XLB to save their lives - skin too thick, not enough broth, etc.  Has a modest dimsum menu (made to order) - the shiu mai was yummy as was the luo buo gao (pan-fried turnip cake). Didn't care for the bbq pork in the cha siu bao (bbq pork buns) - the bread was decent, but the actual flavor was eh.  Noodles: Niu nan (beef tendon) noodle was decent, and for the less adventurous the pork & shrimp dumpling noodle was delish. Everything tasted fresh and well-made - zero MSG after-taste.  Decor is under-stated modern Chinese, red/white accents, black lacquer. Tastefully done. Restaurant is on the quieter side, which is good for a break. Prices are reasonable ($15ish for noodles, $9/dimsum dish).  Service was average but would return if I was staying at the Encore.",

My husband and I stayed at the Wynn since we had a 4 day weekend (Thanksgiving weekend).  On Saturday night, we decided to have some Chinese food.  I read the reviews and looked at the pictures on here and it looked great.  My husband was craving for Chinese food also.  We didn't have reservations and arrived around 6:30pm.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  The place wasn't crowded, but had a handful of groups already dining.    We ordered 4 items to share since a reviewer stated that they were small portions, which wasn't the case for us.  Didn't look like they were small portions.  I guess for me, the portions were just right.  We ordered the Roasted Duck, Beef with Noodles (it was very similar to Pad See Ew - Thai noodle dish), BBQ pork and Shrimp Fried Rice, and Soft Shell Crab.  Everything was great.  Food was good, very flavorful and so good.  Wait staff was great, friendly, and attentive.    Then a couple of hours later, while in our hotel room, my husband started vomiting.  He threw up about 10 times within 13 hours.  It was just awful.  I don't recommend eating the Soft Shell Crab.  I think that is what did it to us since that was the only one we shared.",

Yes, you might find similar quality in Chinatown for a fraction of the cost, but you're in a casino where you might be dropping $20-50 per hand on blackjack or pulling slots, so in actuality, if you're going to throw money away like that in a gamble, a 'sure bet\" is to treat yourself to a nice meal at Red 8, and you'll always walk away a winner!",

I got to try:   Oxtail Soup Jade Dumplings  Shrimp Pad Thai  When she first set the oxtail soup in front of me, I was a little worried. Never having tried it, I did not know what to expect and the visible bone surprised me. Reservations aside, I tried the broth and it was excellent. From the broth on moved on to the carrot, carefully avoiding the bone. The vegetables were also delicious so I decided to go a hard and try the meat. It was excellent. Very tender and had a great flavor. I would absolutely order again.   The Jade Dumplings also looked a little bizarre as they are bright green. They were also delicious. Very moist and tasty filling.   The shrimp on the Shrimp Pad Thai were huge and full of flavor. The rest of the dish was pretty standard fare. I had asked for my Pad Thai to be extra spicy but I felt like it lacked heat. All in all, I love Pad Thai and this dish satisfied.   I will definitely be back to try another dish.",

    "text": "So for the people who know me, they know I primarily stay at the Encore or Wynn resorts only. A group of us we're at the pool for the majority of the day and then got hungry so we decided to go to Red 8 at the Wynn side. We approached the hostess desk to get a table for 4 and she told us that she can't help us because they have a dress code and can't seat one of our persons since he's wearing a tank top. Mind you he's not wearing a wife beater and there were a few people seating who had on tank tops. Also to add, we were staying in the Tower suites at the Encore so not like we're rift raft just strolling thru the property. We pointed out to the hostess that they have people seated and eating who are wearing tank tops and all she kept saying was that's their \"resort dress code policy\". I find that amusing since we ate at Jardin a few hours before dressed in the same attire. My group then asked to speak to a manager and someone else came out just reiterating the same thing. I then asked for the general managers name and card so I can contact them. The manager what for and I told her, ( named Ida Shek) to inform them how we're being treated. Both my host and attorney will both be hearing of this. I'm all for rules, laws, and equality.... but don't tell me it's not allowed when there's other people inside dressed the same way. Did they treat us like that because we're of darker skin tone? Because my friend with the tank top is gay?",

We only had the dim sum and one order of lettuce wrap. The Gardein Shumai was pretty good for not being the real thing, but the dumplings stuck together. The Gardein Buns were really good. Overall we really enjoyed ourselves. Great atmosphere and friendly service, even though it was pretty slow. The food was pretty good too.

Just looking at the menu made me not want to eat. Padt thai for 23 bucks? No thanks. I didn't want the congee because it wouldn't make me full, so I got the udon with fish balls and fish cakes. That was only 12 bucks but soo underwhelming. There was no flavor at all so I had to add a whole bunch of chili oil. My aunts liked it but my dish was definitely not good. I tried some of my cousins padt thai. I could have gotten the same in San Jose for half the price. Not coming back.. well maybe I'll try the congee one day.",

    "text": "It's amazing how after two years, Red 8 hasn't changed anything about how they train their staff!  The service was bad the first time we came here - we actually walked out after ten minutes since no one came to ask us for a simple drink order or even acknowledge our existence.  There was a long line outside but lots of empty tables inside; they just couldn't get their act together about bussing the tables!  This time, we got seated immediately and quickly got drink service.  Only four other tables were occupied, a couple of tables already had their dim sum order, so we figured it was good to get there at opening.  WRONG!  Even with more than 3 waiters and a few more men walking around in black tees - no idea what they were since they enjoyed chatting and laughing amongst themselves but not really seat or serve anyone.  At one point, the host was pouring water for guests!  Beats the hell out of me what the other five men and one woman staff were doing!  Our waiter, an Asian guy was good and did the best he could even though it looked like he was out of breath trying to get to every table on our side of the restaurant.  It's not a big restaurant.  They were just inefficient in service.  They sat a party of five at a square table for four and a party of three at a booth where no one actually say on the booth but just on three chairs around the booth.  Go figure!  Dim sum is the easiest way to get your food FAST.  That includes congee!  However, it was a slight wait and some of the food wasn't even warm!  It baffled and annoyed me.  What's worst then eating bad food is food that is not warm!!  The food is tasty but I expected more.  No I didn't expect to have the best dim sum I have ever had but I did expect a higher standard here.  After all, the Wynn is supposed to take care of the serious high rollers and we know just how many Asians are so.    The soy bean milk here is not sweetened which sucks.  We (Asians) all drinks sweetened soy milk and if not sweetened, given syrup on the side to add.  Sugar does not melt and no one adds bloody syrup to soy milk!!  BTW, don't order the hainanese chicken rice!  I had the chicken rice (room service) and the rice isn't flavorful enough, the soup tastes weird, chicken is dry and the chilli they use is out of a bottle you can buy from the store (sambal olek).  What a disappointment.  I won't return or test my luck again.",

Let me break it down:  Beef Satay- lukewarm, beef was very chewy and grisly, good peanut sauce but nothing special, needed more spice. Singapore Rice- taste like curry powder tossed with rice. woopie. Phad Thai Noodles- smelt like Alpo. Taste was mild, shrimp were bland Kung Pao Chicken- ok, really saucy and very few peanuts, chili oil was separating  THE ONLY really good thing I ate there were their fried turnip cakes with taro. these hold a wow factor that nothing else on the menu can bring! We ordered two more after we tried the entrees.   The food was so disappointing that we gave all our left overs to a homeless man who was sitting near the Hooters Casino. Is that mean?",

It seemed to make some of the people there very happy to feel pretentious.  The food was very solid, the broth on my won ton noodle soup was nice and light, and the won ton were flavorful and made of good ingredients. My Fiancee's potstickers had very good filling, and dipping sauce, though the skin thickness left for a little debate.  The satay was well cooked, and the sauce was decent, though a little lacking on flavor.    The service was a slow, and a bit rude. Now, the question is,... is that what you should expect from an Asian noodle place, or were we applying Western standards to the place that shouldn't have been applied? We'll have to see if we ever return and pay the high prices for decent food.  It's cheap for the Wynn, but not for the rest of the world, and the food is solid...just mediocre service.",

Well I was wrong. It is 2:37am and i am still awake and dieing of thirst, my dad has a minor headache. I guess the MSG they put in the food was way too powerful. After 2 bottles of water and an orange juice i am still awake with the bad taste of MSG in my mouth. If your OK and not allergic to MSG this is place to go. I would think for the price they pay they can do better without artificial taste of MSG.",

I know that this is the Wynn and I am supposed to be getting mad comps to offset the overpriced food, but this is a little ridiculous.  $9 for hot and sour soup?  Granted it was made well and such, but dang, it was a portion for one!  $26 for 8 oz of duck and 6 oz of BBQ pork?  $18 for beef chow mein?  It was enough for two... maybe.  $9 for plain congee for one?  Here's the ugly truth.  I was comped $80 for 10 hours of blackjack (which is a mildly crappy food comp, by the way).  Somebody's got to pay for that.  It's the same reason why the Buffet is $33 for Sunday brunch (no champagne).  None of this explains why the Wynn Buffet is so terrible though, but I'm getting off topic here.  Anyway, if you are a big fish (or maybe a mini-whale), I'm sure you won't care, but for us mortals, it sort of matters that this really is a pretty bad deal.

I have to say though, the flavors were on par with what you'd expect (sweet and sour tasted like it would at another restaurant, the dim sum tastes like it would elsewhere, etc).   Our waiter was very accommodating, especially since our party kept growing as people came wandering in late. He was very good about making sure we had our drinks, that the newcomers were included and got food, etc.  Overall, good solid service, food is average, but definitely something I'd eat again if in the right company/mood.",

I was a little surprised though that they provided cheap bamboo chopsticks instead of the nicer looking ones I usually find in more upscale asian restaurants.  The menu has favorites from different asian cuisines. From  the dim sum offerings we tried the shrimp dumplings and veggie rolls. Both were tasty and well cooked.  For the entrees we got the seafood Laska, the penang flat noodles and the broccoli dish for my vegetarian friend. All of us liked our entrees for the most part. I think the dishes could be more spicy but I have that complaint with most places. They did provide some hot sauce to spice it up.  One of my friends had the Mojito which he said was pretty good. I had the Tsing Tao which was just what I needed.   Its obviously a little expensive overall but thats to be expected in a place like the Wynn.",

(had to be more precise so my 5* rating would be valued)  yes some of them aren't authentic but screw it, because its shiu mai was fucking good.   the last time i stayed at Wynn(which was last may/june), i was here about 2-3 times. this time, i was here for another 3 times, not including the dimsums we had for room service. we had our regular dimsum and i liked everything but cha siew bao(pork bun) because 1.i'd tasted better ones <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.it&s=e94dd8d17f5a9dbf9702f74fe889509c23ca8663a3b21940ec2a77a6564596be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2.it</a> didn't taste like pork at all. i think there was something else mixed in there(human meat?) but it didn't taste good. one of my favorite dim sum, sesame rice ball, wasn't that good either. disappointed.  however, the har gow, siew mai, kway teow, century egg+pork floss congee(room service), can't remember a hundred other dim sum we had, but they were just 5*. i'd never even had that good a kway teow in singapore.   THE CHILLY!! the chilly casted a spell on us. how can there be such a good chilly made? spicy and sweet at the same time. even better than the one i made. comparable to indonesian chilly. it was so good my korean friend and i each requested for some to be taken home.   it's not over! i haven't mentioned the service yet! one of the korean lady server(i asked if she was japanese because she was so hospitable). everyone else was good but she was excellent.",

We were staying at the Encore so we just walked through our hotel over to Wynn and stumbled upon Red 8.  We walked up to the restaurant and saw the words dim sum and that did it for us.  We were sold.  We each got cocktails which were tasty but forgettable.  Nothing special here.  We ordered dim sum and appetizers only since we had dinner in a few hours and didn't want to fill up.  We ordered - Steamed pork buns - Amazing.  Sooooo light and fluffy Shrimp dumplings - Very good, but nothing fancy Chicken Satay - The chicken was good but the peanut sauce was a little boring Pot stickers - Fantastic.  Extra meaty.  Sometimes pot stickers are all filler and no meat, not the case here.  We left very satisfied but craving more pork buns.  They were soooooo good.",

Take it from me, if you have never eaten Chinese food before or you think Panda Express is just lovely, than you'll think this is Chinese food heaven.    But if you've ever had any decent Chinese food in your life, you'll be disappointed.  The food is bleh compared to most mid-level Chinese restaurants you can find on any corner of any street in the U.S.  For Chinese food, the prices are extremely expensive, but I wouldn't mind paying for it if the quality was there.  Ambiance is great.  Tastefully decorated- even down to the dishware.  I like going in there just for drinks.  They really need to hire more staff.  I've been here a few times and each time the waiters are running around with their heads cut off.    Overall, I expect better at The Wynn.",

We didn't want a full meal as we had had a big lunch, so we opted for just drinks and entrees. She had the Sweet & Sour Chicken and I had the Kung Pao Chicken - both staples on the American Chinese menu. The portions were adequate, but we may have wanted a little more if we had been hungrier. Nevertheless, it was still a very good meal.  The atmosphere is quite eye-catching as you walk by the restaurant with its red decor (hence the name). We were seated by a window looking out to the Wynn casino floor, but didn't find it overly loud or distracting.  After our meal, tax, and tip the total came to about $55 for the two of us (two entrees and non-alcoholic drinks).",

But instead, my 'Classic dan dan noodles with pork' dish paled in comparison to the Beef Chow Mein or the Mongolian Beef that my friends ordered. My biggest complain about the classic dan dan noodles with pork is that there was no pork and that I had to mix my own sauces and seasoning. The black sauce that came with this dish was super salty so you have to be conservative while mixing it or else you'll end up with a dish that is bland yet overly salty.   I also asked for the palm pocket, an expensive dim sum item that was nothing to rave about. Now I understand the mix of bad and good ratings for this place. Be careful what you order!",

I asked the waiter why the noodles didn't have any pork and he told me it is ground up in the sauce. It would probably good to have that described on the menu. I opted for the $23 roast duck. The duck and sauce were tasty but that was it...you got a few pieces of duck and sauce...no veggies, no rice no nothing...$23. My husband ordered the lamb special $28. Cooked nicely and he enjoyed the sauce. At least with his dinner he received rice. Overall the food was good but still overpriced for what you received. Total for dinner was $100 not including tip.",

I ate here on a Wednesday night after flying in, and it was a little bit late as well, so the place was pretty empty. It's very low energy, which might be good if that's what you're searching for.  Our waiter was nice enough but not at all helpful - no suggestions, no explanation of the menu regarding sizes of the dishes or recommendations regarding whether we should share, etc. I live in South Central Texas, so although I love Asian food, I'm no expert at ordering it because other than disgusting, huge Chinese buffets, there are no Asian restaurants around here. I needed help knowing how big the dishes were to order properly, so I felt lost. I would have loved to have been more adventurous in my ordering and tried new things, but the menu is just lists of dishes and zero explanation about what's in them.  We ended up with pork steamed buns, spring rolls, a bowl of Hot and Sour soup, and Kung Pao Chicken. The steamed buns - one of my favorite things - were disappointing. They weren't cooked properly, so they were gooey, not soft and delicious, and I found the round, ball-like presentation not what I was expecting since I've only ever had them shaped more like a taco. The spring rolls were fine (it's a spring roll). My mother had the Hot and Sour soup, and she's so extremely unable to tolerate spice that her eyes were watering, she was sniffling, and she couldn't finish a third of it. I had the Kung Pao Chicken, and conversely, I found it bland but decent.  I really don't see any reason I'd go back to Red 8, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it.",

The string beans are perfectly cooked albeit a little over seasoned.  The chow fun is mediocre but not bad.  The dim sum items are hits and misses with some strangely peculiar flavors.    All in all, if you're extremely lazy and don't want to leave the Wynn/Encore buildling like me, this place ain't too shabby.",

The prices are on the higher end for most chinese restaurants, but the atmosphere, service, and quality of the food fit the price.  My favorite dish here is the mongolian beef and the fried rice.  The hot & sour soup is also a great choice for an appetizer to share.  They offer many seafood options and many authentic dishes as well. The eggrolls here are not my favorite, but I am picky when it comes to Chinese food.  Highly recommend this spot if you are in the mood for an elevated Chinese food experience.",

We put our name in for a table and was told it would be 30 minutes. 20 minutes later, we got a text message saying our table was ready!   It is lovely inside and the menu was extensive with your typical Americanized Chinese food but srpinkled with more traditional dim sum fare. We ordered the crab rangoon (very good); Oxtail soup (excellent), Miso soup (good); steamed pork buns (not good); Penang Style Flat Rice Noodles with Shrimp (excellent); a duck special (very good); Red 8 Combination Fried Rice (very good).   All in all, it was a good meal.  The server was quite good and my son recognized quickly that each meal price ended with $.88. That was a nice touch. There are so many options of places to eat at the Wynn and on the Strip. This is not a bad option for a casual meal. Prices are what you'd expect from a casino restaurant.",

Laslty, the dish of the night is the duck! It was succulent with crispy skin and tender meat underneath. The thing that I appreciated the most that each dish tasted different and had very different flavors. No MSG here. The service was professional and discreet. The only feedback I would offer the restaurant was that they brought all the dishes at once whereas I would have preferred to stagger them throughout the meal.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.ca%2FShowUserReviews-g45963-d1601201-r538152367-Red_8_Chinese_Bistro-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html&s=0acdf79295082d3798c346beb2392a2ebf39b23b1403676e06c6a253b4d882ad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserR...</a>",

    "text": "Average. The only words that completely describes my experience here. The ambiance is dull, not decorated much. It looks like a random cafe apart of the hotel. A Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas, in my opinion has the ultimate opportunity to decorate, make themselves stand out. Not be so bland.   The price range was decent. I'm actually a bit surprised it wasn't as expensive as I was expecting it to be. The average cost of a dish is 20.00 dollars. Very affordable!   OHH how could I forget what pissed me off upon arrival. I was wearing high waisted jeans. And an adorable crop top from free people. Possibly an inch of my belly was showing, (mind you I'm 28 & a nurse). The hostess pointed me out, and said \"ohh you can't enter, your stomach is showing.\" I looked her dead in the eye and moved my shirt down the one inch, like really? Then she got all giggly. Maybe you guys should realize I'm not some hooker & calm the fuck down over one inch of skin. This is VEGAS how on earth would they even have such a stupid rule like that when crop tops are a major fashion trend.   Now moving onto the food, just average. Orange chicken was okay, chewy, a little rough/dry. The first set of noodles we ordered \"Hong Kong noodles\" were very strange, they had a Gooey texture. We returned it for a different dish. The walnut prawns were the best thing we ate, only dish that stood out to me.   Overall this is an average restaurant. Due to the dress code BS I won't return for sure. The food is okay, service okay.",

Both didn't happen.   I am staying as a guest in the Wynn and have many times before. I wanted to grab a quick late lunch prior to going out and eating at SW later. So that's two places I'm deciding to spend my money out of the hundreds and thousands of places to go on the strip.   I got the crab rangoons, lettuce wraps, and Mongolian beef and a drink. First of all, the crab rangoons were actually good. No issues there. The Mongolian beef was ok and good spice level. PF Changs has better lettuce wraps and bigger portions than Red 8. I also waited over 8 minutes for water refill and had to flag down a waiter to get me it. I was checked up on one time and almost just left alone my entire visit. There were 3 people standing by the walls and staring at everyone, but must have forgot me. Service and lack of food taste/quality for price is the main reason for the low rating.   I'm pretty annoyed that 2 appetizers, an entree and one drink came to $71 for mediocre food. Overpriced food that doesn't satisfy my is my biggest pet peeve especially that I have thousands of choices. I wasn't raving when I left. I absolutely love the Wynn, it is my favorite hotel in all of LV, but Red 8 missed the mark for me.  There were also gnats and a few flies that came by our table which is interesting since it's tucked away and I never see any of that throughout the rest of the casino.  To end on a good note. The ambiance and where we sat were great. Hope SW tonight is a better experience.",

Which sort of sucks since most restaurants or at least decent ones on the Strip close at 10, which is monumentally surprising given the nightlife and casinos.  This place was open and given it is in Wynn's Chinese themed hotel the restaurant service Chinese cuisine.  But this is not your run of the mill Chinese place that you see on the corner.  The restaurant is casual but the quality is that you would expect from a high end place.  So we came in about 10 pm.  We ordered.  Classic Hot & Sour, Miso Soup, Lettuce Wraps, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef and Fried Rice to share.  I can't say I have had a better quality Chinese cuisine.  Unlike the neighborhood places the food was light and not hit your stomach like a ton of bricks but filling enough.  I would love to visit the place again.",

    "text": "NYE dinner at Red 8. We wanted to stay near by and not leave our hotel. Did I expect more? Was I expecting to get my mind blown away by the food? No...I was expecting a good meal. Here's our experience with the food at Red 8. I will just pin point a few major things that made this meal bad enough that I'm writing this.  You know the look of food when it's been sitting out. Yup that's what our food looked like.  1st dish...the braised soup, okay tasty, hot(tempt)..okay start  2nd dish...salted fish fried rice...it was warm and some bites were way too salty from the salted fish.  3rd dish...crispy skin pork. It was good, tasty but again warm. The meat had that pink shine like it's was sitting around. Ugh 4th dish...spicy dumplings, not that spicy but whatever's I can always add spice. Bit into it and the meat was room tempt. SMH sad...very sad excuse for a high end restaurant in a high end hotel in Las Vegas.   I understand it's a business and many lives are affected by our comments about an establishment. I would rather not post than to post a negative review but this was ridiculous.  To put a subpar product out there for vacationers looking for good food is very disappointing.This dining experience could have been some guests only experience with Chinese food that's not fast food and Red 8 failed to show people that Chinese cuisine isn't just Panda Express (nothing wrong with PE, I eat there lol) or some cheat quality fast food joint. They put this poor quality food out as representation of Chinese food, the workers, owner(s) and the Wynn Hotel, is a shame. Those people might not want to try Chinese food again or pay a higher prices for great Chinese food when they had an experience as mine. End of rant. lol  I hope this is an isolated experience and I just got unlucky. Happy New Year and happy eating everyone!",

So, I'll start with what we had.  We ordered mango pudding and it was delicious!  They also had other desserts that were appealing --- lychee sorbet, coconut pudding, etc. but aside from the mango pudding, we also ordered their fried banana with ice cream. I know it's hard to mess up fried banana.  But Red 8's was fried to perfection -- not too sweet and not too soft!!!  The main dishes we had included mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken both of which were moderately-spiced.  There was nothing extraordinary about the dishes.  I suppose they tasted comparable to chinese food from any China town, only served in fancier plates.  We also had vegetable fried rice and it was average.    Although we were in a lively mood at dinner, having spent an entire day filled with activities, the food did not necessarily sustain our mood.  I felt a little dehydrated towards the end, which is why I drank a lot of water and ate most of the desserts to neutralize the slightly-salty taste from the beef.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas a few weeks ago and got the chance to try 3 Asian casual dining restaurants at a couple of Vegas hotels - Red 8 (Wynn), Beijing 99 (Caesar's Palace), and Wazuzu (Encore).  Out of the 3, I would rank them the following in terms of authentic flavors and yumminess -   1. Red 8 (yummiest) 2. Beijing 99 (delish) 3. Wazuzu (boo!)  I would rank them like this in terms of value  1. Beijing 99 (good selection of entrees and price range between $12-$19) 2. Red 8 (also good selection of entrees and prices between $12-$19) 3. Wazuzu (OVERPRICE ALERT!)  Overall, I would return to Red 8 and Beijing 99 for solid PF Chang-like food with PF Chang-like prices.    The chicken stirfries at Red 8 hit the spot in the couple of dishes we ordered.  The sweet and sour pork packed a vinegary punch.  The portions are well-sized, and the wait staff was friendly.  Best of all, the entrees are mostly under $21.  That's great compared to other Vegas restaurants that have $40 entrees!  Other things on the menu that we liked - the wonton noodles, and the dim sum.  I'm sure there are other better Chinese options off the strip, but Red 8 is a solid Chinese bet if you're stuck on the Vegas strip without a car to get to decent Asian places in Vegas.",

He then offered to get us another dish and we asked for him to take the walnut prawns (which we ate less than a third of) off the bill. This took another 10-15 minutes apparently to get his managers approval. The service was poor, the food average at best and it was somewhat pricey for what we got.",

The kung pao chicken tasted like lean cuisine-- painfully bland.  The spring roll looked like something I might throw in the microwave at home.

But then again, it's also not fair to serve mediocre food at very high prices. I think my 1 serving bowl of hot and sour soup was something like $14. But, the coffee is always fresh and delicious and they give you a crystallized sugar stick, cool! Still, we always order way too much food and still enjoy ourselves.

The service is not great, and there are times when you sit there with an empty glass.  Then why not bash the hell out of this place?  Because there arent alot of dimsum places in LV, and their egg custard buns for dessert are delicious.  Its quite the redeeming factor.",

The service was pretty good, especially in light of the fact that our group of six was a few cocktails deep by the time that we were seated. We ordered mostly dim sum type food and everything was delicious. Nothing particularly stood out. The prices were reasonable and the wine list was good. We had three bottles and probably ten dishes and the bill came to $230 or something like that. Not bad for 6 people in Vegas.",

    "text": "Since Wana did me the honor of writing a long review, a could cut mine short (see Wana L.).  Went here for my bachelorette dinner and the decor and ambiance was very chic and modern.  It's a pretty small restaurant, but we got the best seats right alongside the window (with no glass) to observe passerbys or for them to observe us 12 girls.  The food was family style and we had ordered boky choy, kung pao shrimp, mongolian beef, ma pao tofu, and penang noodles.  My favs were the mongolian beef, penang noodles, and the kung pao shrimp.  Portions were pretty big.  My friends also loved the bok choy but wished they would cut the pieces a bit smaller because they were hard to chew.  If you like PF Changs, it is similar to that type of \"Chinese\" cuisine where it's an attempt to recreate Chinese dishes with a modern twist.  Service was A plus and I even received 2 complimentary desserts: coconut ice cream and a mango pudding/custard. I don't like coconut and the mango dish was confusing - some of the party said it tasted like \"refrigerator\".  If that sounds confusing, imagine something you left uncovered in the fridge for a few days.  In any other city, this might stand alone because of the concept and decor, but here in Vegas it's not quite cutting it.",

The food itself is pretty tasty but the portion size left us all wanting for more. Pan fried noodles and the roast duck were the two dishes that particularly stuck out in my mind.

Came on Sunday night and was quoted 20 min wait for two, which held True, I killed time watching dancing fountains sputter to the Sinatra B side and Disney tunes outside.   I am a big fan of roast duck noodles, the soup version, and though it wasn't on the menu, they happily fulfilled my request without hesitation, even asked if I wanted duck deboned- yes, please!   For appetizer we got fried soft shell crab- pure indulgence, deep fried and calorie laden, with jalapenos and roasted garlic, delicious!   I also had jasmine tea, which was a very nice flavor, and dessert of lemon grass pannacota. I love pannacota and love lemon grass, and though I never, ever order dessert, I couldn't resist. I thought it was delicious, though could have done without topping of chopped mango and strawberry, that was kind of a sloppy afterthought.   Service was spotty, a bit slow and some people around us got impatient.   All in all, you can certainly get Chinese food for less than $100 for two (no alcohol), so it's a once in a while indulgence.",

I tried to tempt them with Japanese food at Mizumi but raw fish wasn't up their alley, either.  We stumbled across Red 8 and their eyes lit up.  Pan-Asian, it was!  As a vegan, I was absolutely delighted to be dining at a Wynn restaurant, knowing there would absolutely be delicious food for me to eat.  I started with a soy Thai Iced Tea and I nearly lost my mind, it was so good.  I ordered two vegan dim sums, the white lotus and jade dumplings, at the waitress' suggestion.  I don't remember what's actually in them (spinach?  mushrooms?) but they were both fantastic.  For my main, I had the Vegan Tofu Shiitake.  It was okay, but a little boring!  We had some hot chili paste with the dumplings so I liberally spooned that over my food to give it some oomph.  Even boring tofu and mushrooms can still hit the spot, and I left quite full.  My in-laws loved their food and everyone had a great meal.  The prices are exorbitant but nothing worse than any place else in the area.  Next time I'm in the area and craving something similar, I think I'll have to check out Wazuzu.  Similar menu, but more vegan options (including sushi!).",

Not quite sure what it is.. could be the seating,, could be the fact that the casino is right there and that wiff of cigarette smoke is following you into the dining area..However, If you are on this side of the strip and in need of some chinese food, this place will quench that need.  Service was very friendly and just enough. Prices are high for chinese food but thats expected in a restaurant of a major hotel like the Wynn. Entrees average $20 and up and this is a sharing type restaurant so expect to get a minimum of 2-3 dishes for a table of 2 people..  The food options here are very typical of what you would find in your hometown go to chinese spot. You can expect to find here the usual wok fried noodles, fried rice to the kung pao chicken.. They also over dim sum and noodle soupl..   Go here to quench a need but if you are looking to be wowed maybe look at some other options.",

When we went,it was crowded and mostly everyone dining were Asians, and if the food wasn't good or close to how it should taste, you probably wouldn't see them there eating.  I think some ppl may be disappointed because they are chasing the Panda Express taste, Red 8 won't deliver that.    We ordered the XO String beans (excellent XO flavor), Yangzhou Fried rice (lots of shrimp and good flavor), HK style Wonton Egg noodle soup, Mapo Tofu (excellent flavor) and Pork & Preserved Egg Congee.  These were all finished between 2 adults and a child!  It tasted just as good as you can get in Rosemead or Monterey Park, except of course at a much higher price, but its a given when you dine inside the hotel.  For now from the 5 dishes we had, they get 4 stars.  We will definitely be back again next time on our stay and try more.",

My bf & I were hungry, and this place looked enticing thanks to the interior design.  We may come back again for convenience sake, but it isn't at the top of our list.  Coming from the bay area and growing up Chinese, the food here is decent but far from authentic and lacks great flavors.    Mykl was our friendly waiter and delivered great service to us.  We had a couple bottles of sake which did not disappoint, ox tail soup, bok choy with scallop sauce, cold cucumbers and chicken and jelly fish.    The ox tail soup was the best.  It was pretty simple with green onions floating around and a decent portion of oxtail.  The meat didn't fall off the bone though.  The baby bok choy was okay but the scallop sauce wasn't live with flavors.  The same went for the chicken and jellyfish.  This dish had light flavors to it but once again nothing exciting.  The chicken was soft and the jelly fish was fresh.  I didn't care for the cold cucumbers much.  I thought they would be more soy sauce and garlicky, but they had a ginger sweetness to them I didn't care for.  My bf liked them fine though.  Honestly, PF Chang's serves better Chinese food, but I'm sure there are other things on the menu I might like better.  The red and black decor with dramatic lighting is absolutely top notch design, but that and the service here is all you will find to be exceptional.",

Everything was great (the pad thai comes spicy, but ask them to reduce the spice if you are not a fan) The presentation of the dishes went above and beyond, something I don't normally expect from restaurants in vegas. So pleased to have chosen this place to eat, it was one of the highlights!",

Portions were not large but just good enough to be shared among three people.  Prices were higher as expected since it was in Vegas.",

I seldom spent time on social media but this is the worst experience I ever had in Vegas. I should have read some review before I stepped in this 3.5 star restaurant.   We came here with my younger kids and we werent exactly sure of the menu as we were unfamiliar with some words. Our waitress already had that judgmental vibe from the start. Didn't care to explain when we asked her.  Me: \"What is Har Gow?\"  Waitress (name starts with \"D\") : \"Its Dumpling\" --with duh! attitude and facial expression...uhh yeah we see that, its what it says in the menu.  Hoping she would elaborate more but nope.   Me: So what's difference between Har Gow and Shanghainese dumpling ? Waitress (name starts with \"D\") : \"Both steamed\" ---- thank you.....    The service was absolutely terrible and we felt really rushed to order, eat and pay our checks. Our waitress abruptly took plates away without really asking.   Is Vegas really lack of nice and knowledgeable people to work in hotel industry ??? This waitress should be out of her job the first day she work in any hotel in San Fransisco. Her attitude and the way she answered each questions were pointless.  Feel bad with the rest of the team in this restaurant, Dim Sum was not bad, seems better than some good Chinese restaurant in SF, one black sheep can got a team down. Management should do something.   NEVER coming back to this place....STAY AWAY!!! or if you wanna challenge this waitress, go and find out if my word is correct. lol",

I'm not a politeness snob from wait staff usually but if you look at us unhappily I will notice.    They also got our order incorrect, we ordered the beef tofu and they gave us ma po tofu.   We ordered mongolian beef here and the portion was tiny!  I paid almost $20 for it and the ingredients weren't top notch and the portion was low.

When I ordered soup dumplings, I was surprised that there was only three when the price of it is typically for 8-10 in a big pan. Although the soup dumplings were cute and unique, they weren't worth it. The alcoholic drinks are also super pricey. Every shot is roughly $15-20, so if you order 10 shots, the price starts adding up really fast.",

The host asks you to put your number and name down and they will text you when you're the table is ready (great new service!), the table was readily available after the text was received.   Things started going a little downhill with the waiter, where he had a little attitude upon our ordering. (It happens)  But what led me to deduct the stars here was the lack of staff and attentiveness to guests.  -Plenty of customers having their hands up waving to get attention.  -A manager making eye contact with me and my hands and turning away...  -tip to staff: clean up after your customers asap! Don't leave tables unattended.   Food: 2/5  -Boba milk tea is extremely watered down and tasteless -Thai ice tea, on the other hand, was sugar with a side of milk. ( Supersweet ) -Most dishes have way too much oil, similar to local china town fast food restaurants  -congee was good   Location, environment: 3.5/5  The restaurant is clean and well managed,  good location within the hotel. A little noisy and a little crowded.   Red 8 is not somewhere I would want to go out of my way for when craving Asian, or chinese--there are plenty of better options. However, if you happen to be in the hotel, and happen to want Asian, then why not. Just keep your expectations low.   Note:  This review is based on the expectation of the store. Red 8 is a Chinese restaurant inside the Wynn, a top hotel on the strip.",

We had their Soft Shell Crab entree (Rock Salt & Jalapeno Pepper) and one of their signature dishes, a duck in noodles.  The soft shell crab was a five star dish, a large amount of the crab, all crispy and fresh tasting, and well presented.  However, the duck, as is the case with many U.S. Asian restaurants, was sub par, tasting frozen and freezer-burn-esque.  I questioned the waiter on how good their duck was before ordering it, and he insisted that it was great, but it was not.  Actually, everything in the duck speciality dish OTHER THAN the small amount (wasn't even that much) of duck itself, was great.   They have a separate more private area for larger groups who are willing to drop enough money to qualify for that seating.  It's a nice restaurant, and perhaps if we had avoided the duck dish their star rating would be a four.  Open late, to midnight on weekdays, which is a definite plus.",

I'm a Chinese food snob since my dad is a Chinese Cook. All the dishes were very expensive but came out very quickly and was good, but not mind blowing.   Had the Singapore vermicelli- the shrimps were nice and plump and you can tell they don't skimp on the ingredients but then again if you're paying more than $20 on this dish you better not be skimping on the quality or the freshness of the shrimp and cha shu for this dish. Good portion to share for 3-4 ppl (assuming you order the dishes to share).   Wonton noodle soup- was ok. You have the option to customize your noodles. If you don't like the regular thin egg noodles that's often paired with this, you can opt for flat noodles. So you have options here which is nice!! Could share with 1-2 ppl.   Tofu dish with vegetables- ok. This dish had two different types of vegetables: broccoli and yu choy (softer texture veggie compared to broccoli). The tofu was fried pretty nicely and not too salty. Mushrooms were nothing special. Probably better if it was served with some a variety of mushrooms with the hefty price of this dish. Best to eat with a bowl of rice!  Overall good place to eat if you need a quick bite or if you're craving Chinese food. What's amazing is you can have breakfast food \"aka dim sum\" food at night if you feel like it. They serve it all day long.",

    "text": "We needed somewhere to eat fast after arriving at the hotel today. We were immediately seated and orders went through quickly. We had eaten at this place a few years ago, and we weren't 100% satisfied with it after that experience (because of the price to food ratio). However, today was different. Staff was as attentive as they needed to be, and food was honestly really good. If you've ever eaten at a legitimate Chinese place, you will know that they seat you, get your order, and leave you alone so service didn't bother me. I love some homemade Chinese noodles back home in LA, and these were honestly pretty close! The portions of some dishes are still a bit small- my friend ordered the Mongolian beef and it's definitely for just one person. Some dishes are okay for family style, some not, so it's better to play safe and order separate or share with just one person. There's definitely better Chinese food within Vegas locally outside of the hotel, however for a quick fix this place worked great. I would definitely go back while staying at the Wynn!",

The soup was passable but again, nothing I'm longing for.  I would recommend trying Wazuzu or Wing Lei.",

The service and ambiance is good though, hence the 2 stars.  Crispy pork belly was crispy, but not seasoned enough or tender enough. Penang style fried rice noodles were a joke - did not taste anything like the actual char kuey teow you get in Penang, Malaysia. The wide rice noodles were still a little hard - which means it wasn't cooked adequately. It only came with 4 shrimps, and the dish was $25.   Nothing here taste like it warrants the price.",

We chose Red 8 for dinner one evening and I am very pleased with that choice.  First of all, the ambiance is really nice and Asian inspired.  Our waiter was really friendly and spent time chatting with us between courses and what not.  He also convinced us to try a dessert that was truly amazing.  It was peanut butter ice cream that they made on property.  After seeing the bill, I thought the price was fair enough that I would come back as a cash customer.  I recall it being around $100 for three people, and we had appetizers and main courses before sharing the dessert I mentioned.  We were all very satisfied.",

After opening the menu, my eyes almost started bleeding. Combination fried rice $25?!? One plate of normal dim sum $6?! I know it's the Wynn but come on! At these prices we could've just ate at The Buffet and gotten a lot of similar quality food for less.  Since we already sat down and committed to the restaurant, we decided to stay and order. To minimize the damage, we ordered just 3 dim sum plates (cha shu bao, shanghai dumplings, and fried taro balls) and two dishes (broccoli beef and sesame chicken). Growing up in the bay area, I've had my fair share of good Chinese food, and let me tell you, this was not it. The cha shu bao (bbq pork buns) were soggy and the filling was an unidentifiable paste with a few bits of meat. The Shanghai dumplings had no soup in them. The broccoli beef was mediocre.  If you want good Chinese food in Las Vegas, DO NOT go here. There must be better options elsewhere on the strip. This restaurant definitely caters to rich people who don't know much about Asian food.",

I don't know but he wasn't as attentive compared to the other lady serving the table next to ours.   Anyway, I do have to mention their wonton noodle soup is pretty good. The noodle isn't soggy and the wontons taste fresh. We also ordered a stir fried noodle dish which wasn't so bad either. Next time if I do decide to come back I def. won't be ordering their dim sum items. I rather try the other plates. Besides the service and the dim sum this place is decent.",

(unless you like to eat pho bowl size portions.)  **when you are hung over from encore/wynn, you will be glad that a bowl of hot soupy rice is nearby. - dimsum - shu-mai, shrimp dumplings, chicken feet and pan-fried dumplings. i was really skeptical bc i dont really care for dim sum. but i enjoyed it. although it was $$ ($9 for 4 shumai), it was not greasy, had actual chunks of shrimp, not ground up mystery meat. it was all just clean tasting, not oily or salty.  - pan fried noodles: ok, you can skip this. it was kinda bland, but anything can be fixed with some soy sauce and sriracha. the egg noodles had a good crisp and chew, huge shrimp and a good amount of vegetables. again, it was not greasy like typical chinese food.   i'd come back for the dimsum and the rice congee for a late morning eats.",

The lou rou mein/beef noodle soup was very bland in comparison to a typical bowl I would get anywhere in Rowland Heights. I wasn't very impressed; the broth wasn't flavorful, the noodles' texture was very soft and not jelly-like, and the beef, thanks to the bland broth, tasted bland.   The waiter was very friendly and boasted about the food to us as if he had succeeded in satisfying the ethical people of which the food he served originated from...but unfortunately the chef didn't.   Oh, and the price for that bowl was $17.   No. 1 Noodle House is still a better comparison both price-wise at $7, and quality.",

The menu is pretty standard but it's all good quality food.  It's a small venue so unless you have reservations, prepare for a long-ish wait.  Our group shared the chicken satay for a starter and it was very well prepared.  We all agreed that our friend who ordered the bar-b-que sampler had the best plate.  It includes duck, pork belly, and one other meat (chicken?).  While it was extremely good, that's all that was on the plate: just the meats, no veggies or anything.  Overall, a good place but nothing to write home about.",

Cantonese Potstickers- lots of meaty filling, but the skin wrapper wasn't the best.  Mongolian Beef-extremely tender cuts of beef, but the sauce wasn't sweet enough (I hate to say it, but PF Changs is better!)  Green vegetables garlic stir fry-probably the best dish as the veggies were fresh and crisp and it included a nice variety of Chinese broccoli, asparagus, baby bok choy, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, and plenty of chopped garlic!  Woo at The Palazzo would probably have been more authentic...",

Thanks for nothing mom! jk  We waited about 20 minutes to get seated even though the restaurant has half empty.  That was fine,  I understand if they need to get the tables ready.  We sat down and our server didn't come to us for probably about 10 minutes.  Not the start of an enjoyable dinner...  Then we order our food, noodles, a chicken dish, a beef dish, and shu mai.  I was hesitant to order the shu mai because it was around $10 and anyone that goes to dim sum knows shu mai doesn't need to cost $10.  I understand that I was at a somewhat pricey place (after all, it is in the Wynn) but it better be damn good.  Too bad the food wasn't.  Nothing we ordered was good.  At no time during our meal did our server come check back on us to see if we were enjoying the food, or to even refill our empty water glasses.  After we finish our food, our server doesn't come around for like 10 minutes.  We stacked up our dirty plates and everything for her ass and she still couldn't realize that we are done and want the bill.    With the amount of money we spent at this bootleg establishment, I expect the food to be at least good and the service to be great.  Too bad it failed on both counts.",

    "text": "I totally agree with Tom. This place was so bad we stopped eating and asked for our money back.  Our thinking started something like, \"It's in the Wynn, they are hyping the crap out of most of the food at the Wynn so maybe this will be good Chinese food.\"    Boy how disappointed we were. We ordered 3 things. The Pork and Pickled Egg Congee, The Maple Syrup Glassed BBQ Pork and the Mar-po Tofu (Mabo, Mapo, people all spell it different ways)  Congee is supposed come with side dishes, otherwise it's too bland. This one didn't and when we asked if they had any pickled side dishes they could give us they said no.  The BBQ Pork was way too light on, shall we say, crust? The part of the pork that has absorbed the basting sauce that makes HK BBQ so yummy so the pork at Red 8 by taste was maybe a 3 out of 5. But worse, half of it was gristle.  Finally the Mar-po Tofu appeared. Just from looking at it it was clear it would be no good. Mar-po Tofu is supposed to be RED because the sauce is red. It's supposed to be SPICY. It's supposed to have pork in it, at least enough to see a few pieces per cube of tofu. This one appeared to have about 3 peebles of pork, it was almost colorless and once we tried it it's taste matched it's look. It was practically flavorless. Seriously, any pre-packaged mar-po tofu at a Chinese market would have been better than this.  For the price we knew we'd end up paying we decided it wasn't worth suffering though this crap so we called the manager, told him we were unhappy with the food and left.  I felt bad for having to take it that far but that simple 3 piece meal would probably have been $80 at Red 8. For that price I expect the REAL THING not this crap.  DO NOT GO THERE!",

But the portions were huge -- I think the 3 of us girls could have split an entree easily (but where's the fun in that?)    I was interested in the Panang chicken noodle dish, thinking it would be an interesting variation of panang curry chicken.  No, the curry in panang curry comes from the \"curry\" part -- But, the waitress did say the sauce was a brown sauce after I asked for a little more detail, and I thought it was verrry tasty.  Like an 8 for me, yum. My friends stuck to more conventional chinese dishes of sweet and sour chicken + kung pao chicken.  I'd say those were tasty + flavorful, but probably not worth $20 (again, because I am cheap, not because they're bad).  I will say: man, the chicken satay was YUMMY.  The peanut sauce was a little thicker than I expected, but seriously tasted like the chefs ground up tons and tons and tons of peanuts right before sending it out. No lie.  Awesome.  If I won it big in Vegas + wanted good Asian food with a casual vibe, I'd for sure return.  Otherwise, I'm happy dining at fast food places along the way :)",

The top of the entrance had plates and utensils in a circular pattern placed into the ceiling, which was neat.    Growing up near Alhambra, Monterey Park, and Chinatown, I have had my fair share of Cantonese food and Dim Sum.  In my opinion the flavors of Red 8 are a lot lighter than ones from here in SGV area.  All the dishes I had were good but light, and my theory is that the lighter flavors are meant to cater to those who don't eat Dim Sum on almost a weekly basis.  I must say, however, that the texture of the foods were very good.    We ordered five dim sum dishes, abalone fried rice, and Peking duck.  It was definitely a nice change to experience the lighter flavors, but the price was a little high.  Well, maybe I have just been spoiled from the dollar dim sum dishes here in SGV.  And it is Vegas, so everything is overpriced.  If you are looking to eat something light, I would recommend Red 8.",

I was looking for something relatively quick, that was decent and not going to cost me my left kidney.  I got seated quickly at a community table.  Considering where you're at the community table is pretty cool.  It's Vegas so everyone is from somewhere else and my friend and I ended up talking to some pretty cool people at our table.   Instead of ordering an entree I got the shrimp dumplings and chicken satay apps which were both flawless.  The shrimp dumplings are a must try if you go to Red 8.  When it was all said and done I got two large apps, miso soup, a drink, and a coffee for $30.  Pretty good by Vegas standards.",

We have always enjoyed it; we first tried it when the buffet had a 90-minute wait and Red 8 had only a 20-minute wait, and we love Asian food anyway. The service is effiicient, though nothing special, and the food is all good and simple. We've enjoyed the grilled platter, sharing the duck, chicken, and pork, all delicious. My husband loves the chow mein noodles, and, when feeling unadventurous, I actually like the fried rice. The nicest part is the price -- we can eat very well and get out for well under $100, which ain't easy at a non-buffet place on the strip, or at least one with good food. Highly recommended.",

I thought the decor was beautiful with it's \"red\" theme., and the service was great. They sure do train their staff well!  We ordered a few items from the dim sum menu: the chicken feet, pork and shrimp dumplings, ribs, and crab claws. The dumplings were only so-so, I thought. But the other dim sum items were really good. I liked the crab claws and the chicken feet in particular.  In addition to dim sum, we also ordered the soft shell crab and the roast duck. Both really good as well.  This is a place that I'd definitely go back to again. I'm looking forward to trying other items on their menu =)",

Everything tasted decent and up to par, but nothing outstanding.  Food was great to cure the hangover from the night before.  Service was also decent - we came on Sunday afternoon and were served our food almost as quickly as we would have been at Sam Woo BBQ and in an arguably nicer atmosphere.  Plus one star for saving me a trip to Spring Mountain Road and giving me more time at the tables!",

    "text": "Ok, this may sound like blasphemy (sp?), but Red 8 is my favorite restaurant at the Wynn.  And no, Red 8 is not the only restaurant I have been to at the Wynn.  Why do I like Red 8 so much?  Because they're not trying so hard.  WIng Lei is an over-priced mess of a Chinese restaurant....all the flash and glitter, all the hype, but crappy food.  Tableau is a decent French restaurant, but nothing special (despite the hype).  Corsa Cucina is an average Italian restaurant.  SW is nothing special....decent steaks, but that's about it.  Okada is a great place for sushi, and I'm a fan.  But all the places at the Wynn try to appear more than they actually are.  However, Red 8 is different.  No reservations taken, nice open seating, decent asian food (mix of Thai, Chinese, asian-fusion, etc), good drinks, etc.  The menu is simple, the food is good, and try the sea bass.  Order one of those kiwi drinks, grab a couple beers, and truly enjoy a decent meal.  You don't have to dress up.  You don't have to pretend to be someone.  You don't have to spend through the nose.  The service is good, and you can always depend on Red 8 for a good meal.  And if you think Red 8 is expensive, then you might want to re-consider Vegas trips.  Red 8 isn't cheap, but it's ok relative to other Vegas establishments.",

    "text": "It is very hard to find Chinese food that is done correctly here in Vegas. Being from New York, and after searching long and hard, I have found the pizza, but the Chinese has always been something that is elusive. After eating at Red 8 I have found the proper Chinese cuisine. My wife and I started with the potstickers which were to die for. My wife had the roast duck, and it was the juiciest, most aromatic and delicate recipe ever. I decided to go the safe rout,and start off with a common dish-the sweet/sour chicken. Wow! It was light,and the sauce was the right balance of sweet/tart. The rice was cooked to perfection,and I don't think I ever had the dish with real fresh pineapple. The sauteed veggies were like they were picked fresh from the garden and had just the right amount of garlic added for that flavorful kick. The price was definitely a bit more than takeout, but nowhere near the 'fru-fru' places that try but do not deliver. It is still cheaper than a flight to NYC and cab ride to SOHO, and the taste is the same. I cannot wait to go back!",

    "text": "Yes, the restaurant is at a strip hotel.  Yes, most people know that you can get more value for your dollar if you go down to the multitude of restaurants on Spring Mountain Rd.  But, if you are at the Wynn this is an very good alternative.  Yes, there are no reservations but aside from the Buffet, Terrace Point Cafe (open 24hrs), ZooZaCrackers (deli) where will you dine at the Wynn without blocking off 1.5-2 hours for your meal.  Once you look at the menu one can see that Red 8 is a cornucopia of asian food ranging from Malaysian (the chef is Malay), Chinese, Thai.  There is a small selection of dim sum that is very good.  The highlights of the menu (in my opinion) is the dim sum, Oxtail Soup, Malaysian Beef/Chicken Satay, Malaysian Spicy Fried Rice with Prawn Crackers & Mango Chutney, Roast Duck & Roast Pork Combo, Chilean Sea Bass Salt & Pepper Style, and Coconut Pudding for Desert.   There are other great dishes.  Ask the staff what the chef would send to his friends.  Also, it appears to me that many dishes have a kick so if you do not like items too spicy I would let the staff know when you order. Again, you will be paying strip prices but if you do not have reservations at other restaurants Red 8 is a good alternative unless you want to eat the cafe or deli.   Also, Red 8 is open until 11pm on Sun-Thurs and 1am or Fri/Sat. Enjoy.  Update 12/16/07:  I heard the executive chef is leaving for another restaurant.",

I arrived first and there was a table reserved for us. I'm very observant so I noticed all the workers are Asian and the food is very traditional Chinese. Most of the diners are Asian families. Getting the theme.   I've had a rough night from partying, so I didn't have much of an appetite. Of course, I did order the Hot and Sour soup. We shared an order of the kung pow chicken with brown rice and edamame. he asked me how the soup was, and being the honest person, I had to say it was a bit too salty for me. He laughed and said, I like that you're honest and not trying to please people. (at least you all can trust on my reviews :))  Overall, great service and food is pretty good. packed with flavor. Note: They even have Shao long bao. Great place to impress the family or future in-laws.  It is pricey, so don't be surprised. You're at the Wynn! :)",

They had a good selection on the menu and they have a dim sum menu that my daughter was excited about. Prices were a little high but not crazy especially for Vegas.

I mean, if you're desperate for Chinese food and you're not familiar with any decent Chinese restaurants off the Strip, then I guess this place is ok. But be prepared to empty your wallet and still be hungry after. I ordered Mongolian beef and it was just ok. The serving was small, and they charge you extra for a small bowl of rice. Crazy. Rice is staple food item and most real Chinese restaurants give you entire pot for free with your meal. Also the dim sum ranges between $6 - $10.. EACH.

I thought it was interesting as they offer menu items from China, Thailand, India, Vietnam, Singapore, and Korea such as Cantonese noodle dishes, dim sum, duck, Mongolian Beef, and Hong Kong style barbecue.  We started off with the Malaysian Chicken Satay that came with a side of chunky peanut sauce - the chicken was okay, and the the chunky peanut sauce was more on the sweeter side.  I had the Penang-Style Rice Flat Noodles with Chicken and I wasn't a fan of the dish as it lacked flavor.  I did like the flat noodles, though, but they were overcooked.  One of my friends had the Curried Singapore Rice Vermicelli that contained shredded pork, shrimp, egg, and bean sprouts - she enjoyed it, but I wasn't a fan of the different spices that were used.  The restaurant itself had a nice decor with the combination of red and black colors.  Definitely on the pricier side as it is located in the hotel!  +located inside the Wynn",

When we were seated we were placed in what appeared to be an interesting table in a separate area with a view of the casino. There was an open metal lattice wall but unfortunately the smoking lounge was right across the walkway. Smoke wafted into the restaurant and our table the entire time. This may be acceptable in a place where casinos allow smoking but it ruined our experience particularly for an expensive meal. We had the pork wonton appetizer which was good and spicy but not what I expected. They were pork dumplings and not fried. Menu was not very detailed about the appetizer. Had the orange beef and Kung Poa chicken. Both acceptable normal Chinese dishes with nothing great. Being in that smaller area made it difficult to identify our hostess who only came to check on us once halfway through the meal. We did not stay for dessert.",

The food is very Americanized but what more could you expect? The restaurant itself is very modern chic. Definitely not your typical Chinese hole-in-the-wall. On the smaller size in Las Vegas standards. The service was average. It felt like they were always in a hurry for some reason. We would only be able to ask for one thing before they walked off to get it. Why would you want to give yourself more work?   Anyway, my family ordered many dishes including Mongolian Beef, Beef Chow Fun, etc. I was very hesitant and set the bar low so I ordered my own dinner entree, Pork & Preserved Egg Congee. $12 for a bowl of congee is a bit steep but we are at the Wynn!  It was a bit of a surprise. The congee was nice and thick, with good portions of the preserved duck egg and pork. The bowl itself was really big. I was expecting to finish it all myself but I had some left to share with the fam. I'd still definitely prefer to eat at a hole-in-the-wall for just as good quality at half the price.

Right in the middle of the casino, Red 8 has great Chinese food and an open view to the casino floor!   I ordered the maple BBQ Pork with miso soup and just snacked as I calculated all the fun I was going to get into during my stay.  Come by and enjoy the great food, luxurious scene and even catch a couple famous people running around looking lost, check it out!",

The waiter wasn't very friendly or approachable when it came for help.   Through my time there, I had slip off my shoes, and sat crossed in my seat. I had clean socks on and did not think this would be a bothered. I wanted to feel comfortable. Shortly after doing this, a worker there approached me asking me to put my shoes back on because it \"was a restaurant\". This was very odd and ridiculous to me. This restaurant is by no means the best, but the request to me felt out of place. I've been to many restaurants in LA and have done the exact thing and never been reprimanded. I'm paying an absurd amount for mediocrity and now I get to be reprimanded for trying to be comfortable.  The food was mediocre, the service was barely tolerable, and the staff was deplorable.  I will no longer be eating here and believe others shouldn't either.",

We chose this place because it was almost 11:00pm and most of the other restaurants in the Wynn were getting ready to close (This is Vegas for God's sake!!! Why do these places close so early on a Thursday night???) We were seated within 5 minutes in a nice private dining area. All we had to do is close the curtain and it would be a good private dining experience! Well, somewhat private. It kind of felt like we were birds in a bird cage, since it literally was a round cage, where people on the outside can see in. Wait staff were mostly expressionless, like they were waiting for their shift to end so they can go home.   We ordered some dim sum, and since it was getting late, I didn't want to eat anything heavy, so I got the Gardein Cashew Chick'n, Celery, Mushrooms & Ginger. Tastes just like chicken! This place is pretty pricey - $9 for each dim sum dish. So total came to just over $100 for what amounted to be a light snack. No bang for the buck here. Maybe I'll come back and treat someone here (if they pay!!)",

The restaurant is nicely decorated, clean, with a lovely eloquent atmosphere--exactly what you'd expect of the Wynn and really any upscale Vegas resort. The service is friendly and efficient. The food stands out and is packed with flavor. The prices may seem steep for small portions, but the amount of meat and goodies they stuff into every dish is quite substantial and great quality. We had several dim sum items, including Cantonese pot stickers (these are awesome!), shiu mai (huge and tasty), Shanghainese pork dumplings (yummy soup dumplings), prawn dumplings and BBQ pork buns (like a fluffy cloud filled with amazingness). We also shared the Kung Pao Shrimp, which did not disappoint one bit. It was made unlike the usual Kung Pao dishes that everyone is used to (small, cubed veggies and meat), with huge shrimp and large chunks of fresh, crunchy veggies. Combined with fluffy jasmine rice and polished off with a pot of beautiful jasmine pearl green tea, this made for an excellent meal choice.",

Since then, I had cravings for the soup again and again. Born in Hong Kong, I was not able to find the same quality of wonton soup in the States. Expecting the same soup from Red 8, I have to say I was disappointed.   The reason wonton soup had drifted apart from:   Wonton: Tasted okay and had better pork compare to other places. Didn't give me wow factor.   Noodle: They used very thin noodle which is different from typical Chinese restaurant. However, I like the more chewy kind of noddle much better in this dish.   Soup: I am sorry Red 8, but the soup is the worst, even worse than other restaurants and very blended taste.... Soup is suppose to be the soul of wonton soup, and that was one of the reasons I liked the wonton soup from the Wynn Buffet. Red 8 added very little green onion and no garlic chives at all!   Aside from wonton soup, we ordered the dumpling noodle. The best of this meal was the Chicken satays. $10 for four pieces. I also liked our waitress who was a Korean lady. She was helpful and made this dinning experience a good one: bringing syrup and extra lemon for my tea, bringing more green onion for my soup, etc. I hope there would be improvement for the food in the future.",

The egg noodle soup was really good too (it definitely satisfied my mom who was craving soup noodle the whole time we were in vegas!!). I would say this place is WAY better than Wazuzu in Encore.

However, it was worth the $ because the shui mai tasted fresh and delicious.  - Oxtail Soup: $12---flavorful and filling  - Fried String Beans w/ xo sauce: DELICIOUS. fresh veggies w/ flavorful(a bit spicy) sauce.  - Salted Fish Fried Rice: talk about authentic! surprised to see this on the menu and had to cringe a bit for paying $28 (as opposed to $7 in LA), but it was very tasty. We needed to fill up before a looong night of partying, so this dish did the job.  OVERALL: if you're staying at the Wynn,  pressed for time, or absolutely crave for Asian food, then give this place a try.

Let me warn you, they WILL forget about you if you do. Appetizers consisted of the turnip cake + jellyfish/chicken.  Entrees we all ordered pretty much wonton soup/dumpling soup with one order of the panfried noodles.  It took over 30 minutes for a simple appetizer to come out. Entrees took another 15 on top. The dumpling soup i ordered tasted like it came out of a instant noodle package. The pan fried noodles my friend ordered were SOAKED in grease and just wet.  We had to pop our heads out to get our servers attention since we probably only saw him twice.  Mediocre service, Mediocre food, 7 dollars for jasmine Tea, and another bad experience. I will pass on Red 8. Never again.",

The fake cashew chicken lettuce wraps were pretty good,  good sauce.  Overall,  not much better than a cheaper run of the mill Chinese place.  And if you're tall,  the tables are atrocious.

I'd recommend everyone give it a try - I don't think you'll be upset.  SERVICE: My service hasn't been anything terrible or stellar in previous visits. My most recent visit had GREAT service - a nice Southern girl who took several pictures of our table, gave us drink and food recommendations and didn't rush us at all. The hostess agreed to let us have this great \"bird cage\" table/room even though there were only five of us - so nice!  FOOD: This place is like an upscale P.F. Chang's with a larger menu. Our table ordered the panang noodles, the pad thai (with chicken instead of shrimp) and the Kung Pao chicken. Everyone at themselves silly because although the portions are HUGE, the food was so good and no one wanted to leave a noodle behind.  DRINKS: Two of our diners had a mojito and LOVED them - they even had bamboo sticks in them. Really cute. I turned the mocktail lemonade into a cocktail with gin and liked that pretty well, too. Great drink menu for a lunch stop.  ATMOSPHERE: I like the color scheme in this restaurant and have never been disappointed with the table we've been given. One thing I would admit: the other diners in my group did not find the chairs very comfortable.  OVERALL: This is seriously my favorite lunch place in Vegas - a must-stop while we're there. Don't worry about meals long after - you'll be full for the next five hours.",

I hate it when people try to call things like sweet and sour chicken \"authentic\".  That being said it is amazingly good at non authentic Asian!   Pros - Great taste, portions are just right.  Cons - They don't take reservations and the wait can be lengthy at times.  Also, I've been there 5 times now over 3 years and the service is ALWAYS slow.  It's tough to get a refill on anything.    Note- i'm knocking them down a star due to my recent visit.  They had a magician entertaining a table of girls.  Every time the guy did a trick the girls would literally scream and laugh at the top of their lungs.  It was very distracting.  I know it's vegas and I know it's a Casino but it was excessive and clearly many people thought it distracting as well.",

I was lucky enough to come here late in the evening, almost at closing time so I did not have the wait that other's experienced, and the wait staff was quite attentive.   The restaurant itself is lovely inside although you can hear the gaming tables nearby.  The menu is on the pricy side but when you are vegan and it is after midnight in Vegas, options are slim so we gave it a try.  Steve Wynn is vegan so all of his restaurants in his hotels have vegan options on the menu.  Something that makes me say, hey Steve, I'm only going to stay in your hotels for the rest of my herbivore life.  We had the Pad Thai with tofu.  The dish was incredibly delicious and the tofu was cooked perfectly.  Believe it or not, tofu can sometimes be a challenge to cook without it being rubbery and there were two varieties of tofu in this dish.  My husband and I split an order and I was left wishing I wasn't sharing.  We also shared some dim sum appetizers which were unique and cooked to perfection.  As a nice touch, the coffee we really good, served with (and I'm not sure of the actual name of this) the little stick with the sugar crystals on it.  The kids thought this was great.  Even though we were there after closing time, they did not rush us and we enjoyed every moment of our experience.  Can't wait to get back to Vegas and eat at Red 8 again.",

    "text": "Some people may feel that Red 8 serves over-priced, average quality chinese food.  But let me right off the bat say that the food here is actually of a pretty good quality.  It is True that you will pay a slightly higher price for the food given that it is in the upscale Wynn hotel, but then again, if you really crave good, authentic asian food while on the strip and do not have the time to drive out to Chinatown, then Red 8 is probably a good place to settle, because it does have decent food.  So I've giving it a solid three stars becuase it is nothing spectacular, but when you just want a simple Asian meal in a nice setting, then Red 8 is the place to go.  Head to Wing Lei if you want an upscale experience with phenomenal quality Chinese food.   The setting is pretty casual and you can come in dressed as you are, although I have seen some people dining here who are dressed pretty nicely.  Order their noodle dishes - get it from the section of the menu which offers noodle dishes from the Wynn Macau.  Those are the excellent dishes, and if I remember prices correctly are priced about $15 per plate of noodles. Not bad for the Wynn, I think.   I've eaten here a few times and the last time I was here I got the Mapo Tofu.  It was delicious.  The sauce was not too starchy (which can happen when too much corn starch is used) and the pork was pretty lean, yet still added flavor to the dish. As an aside, the debate over mapo tofu is usually whether to use lean or fatty pork.  Fatty pork obviously lends more flavor to the dish, but lean pork is preferred by health-concious consumers.   My wife often ordered noodle soup dishes as she loves them, and the times I have been here for lunch, I always see Asian customers eating the noodle soup dishes, so they are probably pretty good.  As for me, I prefer more saucy or gravy-type dishes, hence my recent pick of their Mapo Tofu.",

I live in the ghetto neighborhood of the Bay Area & when I pay f$9 for a bowl on wonton soup, now that expensive in my book! $11 in San Francisco, that's fair. $15 for Vegas, it's acceptable!

The large tables at the bench seating area as well as the large central tables require that people practically shout to reach each other. I did not appreciate being in the midst of such a noisy place.  Staff were wonderful. Michael the waiter was superb! I had the eggplant and pork (although they serve pork belly and have to explain that to you, it is not on the menu which I think is wrong) with cat's eye noodles. It was delicious. I would have preferred to have pork as stated on the menu though. My husband enjoyed the Kung Pao shrimp very much.  He is a tough critic and stated it was one of the best meals ever. We shared the chicken satays which were among the best I have had and the peanut sauce was texturally superb and seasoned perfectly. I am not ever a fan of bench seating but although you are not totally on top of people next to you on the bench, you are so far away from your dining partner that it is very weird and not pleasing at all.  We were seated near a bunch of twenty somethings under the influence of alcohol whose voices even sober were obnoxious... Next time I would surely choose Red 8 and I would insist on a regular table away from that style of seating. We were impressed by the reasonable prices. Tasty but Noisy.",

    "text": "Decided to try this place since we stayed at Encore and it was convenient. My two friends ordered the beef noodle soup and I ordered the sweet and sour chicken with a side of brown rice. Everything tasted good, but I don't think there was anything special about the food where I'd want to go out of my way to come back. The sweet and sour chicken came out crispy and fresh and it wasn't overly sweet to me. It had the right amount of tangy-ness you'd expect. The beef noodle soup was also good, the noodles weren't overcooked and the beef was tender. Service was good and the restaurant was very clean. Prices are a little steep (came out to around $25 for my sweet and sour chicken with a side of rice) but it's Vegas. Overall a solid 3/5.",

    "text": "Take it from an actual Chinese person. Honestly... not bad!  I cringed as we entered this over-the-top fancy Asian fusion restaurant inside the Wynn. On the menu I saw Japanese edamame but also Chinese dumplings. Oh boy. Here we go.  Cracked open the menu and cringed even more at the prices... Chinese food is supposed to be cheap. What the hell is this $20 chow mein and $9 for 3 dumplings? Whatever, we were crunched on time and needed to eat at the hotel before going out. Also we are at The Wynn. Oh yeah also we are in VEGAS ANYWAYS MOVING ON-  Service was extremely slow (or maybe because we were in a hurry) but after you order, the food comes out really fast. We had a 30 minute wait at 8:30pm last Friday night. We were done eating by 9:45pm.  Here's what I remember ordering (for a party of 6): - xiao long bao (skip it. they have no idea what they're doing here. as expected) - bok choy with scallop sauce - chow mein with beef (surprisingly delicious tender beef. I expected it to be stale) - shiu mai - green beans with garlic (fantastic) - bbq pork buns a.k.a. cha siu bao (surprisingly authentic) - sweet and sour pork   Food came out piping hot and very flavorful and authentic enough. There's nothing that makes my skin crawl more than offensive adaptations attempted by capitalist America at the food of my motherland.  But I gotta say. I was impressed and YES I would eat here again.  Bill came out to about $22 per person.",

However, you are paying for the convenience, location on the Strip (Wynn), and ambiance.  We had the Salt and Pepper Calamari, Stir-Fried Mixed with Chinese Vegetables, and Egg Noodles with Beef mixed with Soy Sauce. I really enjoyed the fact that all these dishes were reminiscent of authentic dishes that I would normally find at a regular Chinese restaurant. The service and cuisine at Red 8 was excellent. I would recommend coming here for a casual Asian lunch or dinner if you are staying at the Wynn.",

Their beef tendon melts in your mouth but the portion is way too tiny. At most, it looks like an appetizer to me. It's located in Wynn so it's very easy to locate. I also forgot to mention that their soup is very flavorful. I liked the sour pickled vegetables that they added in.",

As soon as we sat down our waiter came and greater us and took drink orders. He was very attentive and made sure everything was ok. The food was nothing spectacular just your regular Americanized Asian cuisine. I ordered the combination fried rice which was pretty good. Our food came out in a timely manner which is great! It was a good portion and very filling. I also got a pomegranate martini which was just OK, I've had better.

Besides it was my best friend's 30th birthday weekend so it was time to treat yo'self!  After a day of raisin-ing ourselves by the pool we were starving for some rice and noodles. Sure Chinatown was just an Uber away but this was right in our hotel so we decided to check it out. We immediately decided to get an order of Shanghai soup dumplings, pork bbq bao and pan fried shrimp bao as well as some crispy seafood egg noodles. As I mentioned, the dim sum came in very small portions with high price tags but it was totally worth it. The pork bao had the softest, fluffiest bun I've ever tasted and a perfect ratio of meat to dough. They actually had this dish at the Wynn buffet down the road, but it did not compare to the taste of this by miles. I had never had a pan fried bao before, but it was an amazingly crispy texture that just melted when it hit your mouth.   I'd skip the soup dumplings but I loved how each one was presented in a tiny mini bamboo basket to minimize breakage (they left the wax paper on so be careful of that!). Egg noodles were delicious but no more delicious than what you would get at another good Chinese restaurant in anywhere, America.   Service was friendly and they also sell bubble tea which was nice to grab to go during the rest of our pool days!",

The egg noodles with beef in soya sauce was delicious as was the steamed bbq pork buns and prawn dumplings. The staff was very nice as well. Highly recommend! Hidden gem on the Vegas strip!!!!!!",

We all sat under the cabana and then ended up here. Steve made me and Eric get him a sandwich but it was cool because Steve is a little quirky. That's just the price of hanging out with Steve. I took my mom to the doctor beforehand. I'm sorry? I mean she's okay. Do you really want the background on her? She grew up in the depression. Marilou got a hundred thousand dollars from Steve in the Philippines. People say she's Australian but she's really Philippino at the base.",

Imagine if Thai tea and Vietnamese coffee had a baby, that's what their Thai iced coffee tastes like. I have had this beverage many times elsewhere, but nowhere else is it as perfect as it is here. If I could have this coffee everyday, I would.   Moving on ...   It was good, but not blow-your-mind good. For how much you're paying, this should be the best damn dim sum you've ever had. Their dim sum is a little better than average. I will say, everything tasted fresh.   Don't be discouraged if you don't see something on their dim sum menu - the full menu isn't provided. Out of curiosity we asked if they had certain items that weren't listed, and they were able to accommodate us. Off menu dishes: sauteed Chinese broccoli, soup dumplings, Thai iced coffee, and ha cao.   Overall, good dining experience, just not really worth the hefty price.",

I got the crispy pork belly and let me tel you ITS CRISPY! in fact so crispy it's inedible. Others at my table got a couple chicken dishes and they weren't happy either. I had a taste and they were right the chicken tasted \"off\". The only thing that wasn't bad was the noodles we got. Overall we left unsatisfied...the next day we tried TAO and it was such a great experience and better value it reminded us of how bad the food at Red 8 was haha! I would check it out if you just want a place with a good look to grab something small and chat, definitely not for dinner.",

This time a bowl of classic Hot & Sour Soup was suitably spicy but not overbearing;  Shrimp & Pork Dumpling Noodle Soup was quite nice, as was a lightly sweet Almond Shrimp Dumpling that was covered with almond shavings formed into the shape of small shields.    Honey Prawns featuring honey glazed walnuts and large shrimps were just sweet enough, while lengths of Beef Tenderloin with Black Pepper Sauce and Black Mushroom added were hot and tender bathed in a nice peppery sauce.    A scoop of Strawberry Sorbet diminished some of the flames, and provided a refreshing palate cleanser as a fine finish to my meal.  Service was excellent, and the Asian ambiance elegant and sumptuous, yet casual in attitude and tone.",

Can I say the service is bad again! They were slow with preparing our dinner. We waited 45 mins on the reservation list, they were supposed to text us, and they didn't we had to come back and ask if our table was ready. Once we sat, we waited over 45 mins four our food.

I wasn't thrilled worth the service, very slow to take our order and then get the check at the end. If they were busy, I'd understand but they have a whole 5 tables there.  I also didn't like that the food wasn't spread out. They brought soup and appetizers out at the same time and before we could even finish, the main course came out. Big minus. I like my food to be timed a bit better.  We ordered the shrimp dim sum and the crab Rangoon as appetizers, both were delicious. The hot and sour soup was very flavorful and had a nice kick to it.  As main course, it was suggested to get one dish to share since portions are large. The chefs special included seared scallops so we went with it. It is not a dish to share. 6 small scallops were served with a small salad and brown rice. I wasn't thrilled with the scallops. They didn't have much flavor and he side salad had no dressing. As a whole, I wasn't impressed. I heard great things, so I wouldn't mind trying it again with more traditional dishes.",

The downside to this place is that they don't take reservations and they like to pretend they're busier than they actually are. I would recommend putting your name down, coming back, and not accepting their \"you weren't back fast enough\" excuse they might try to hand out (as in my case). Vegas is all about False scarcity.

The dumplings tasted homemade and fresh but were still just ok.  The chicken and beef entrees were a step up from Panda Express, but a step down from other Chinese restaurants I've eaten at.

On my most recent visit to Red 8, they had made some improvement to the quality of the food and a noticeable change can be compared to my earlier visits. For example, They no longer cook Xiao Long Bao in small foil. I also tried their pepper and salted seabass and it was heavenly. The crispy pork also taste really good and so was the duck. I recommend any patron who visited this restaurant to order to BBQ combination plate for its varieties of meat. I would definitely come back here again!!!",

    "text": "Well, what can I say.  I didn't love this place.  The food was very good but unfortunately we couldn't keep the server's attention.  We had meals that were about $20 a plate.  I attribute that to being Las Vegas so that really wasn't off putting as much as having to beg for refills and having all four of our glasses empty and having that being ignored.  We got a to go box for our leftovers and took it back to the room.  That worked out well.    But then there was the waiting for the check and then when I immediately laid the credit card down.  Waiting for someone to take it.  A woman that worked there finally noticed as our server was elsewhere and took care of it.    I left $5 for a $70 dinner and that was probably too much because instead of staying poor service it probably simply said I was cheap.  Well, whatever.  The food was worthwhile but I don't know if I could take the slow service again.  It was definitely a convenient place while staying at the Encore.",

First time to Red 8 and the experience was... well... Our server was not interested in extending any inspiration to us about the menu.  Questions were met with quick, dismissive responses.  Ok, fine.  He wasn't rude...just not into it.  Whatever then, let's just eat... Food arrived and dish after dish things were just 'meh'.  Dim sum. Over cooked.  Mushroom dumpling was like chewing through an ear.  Baked egg custard- pastry good. Custard split and hard.  Taiwanese flat noodles with sauce.  Where is the sauce? Where's the flavor? Mongolian beef.  Tender. Good. Flavorful. Baby boy choy.  Vegetable.  Overall middle of the road experience for a hotel that usually does nothing but impress.",

This is not fried but steamed.  Great flavor and excellent burn.  For an entree I had the Pork Eggplant with the hand formed \"pigs ear\" noodles.  I could not stop eating.  A large portion that was excellent.  Thank you.",

    "text": "I ate here for Halloween- it was pretty pleasant.  The wait staff was very entertained when we came in our costumes!  We had made reservations and we were seated underneath the gigantic crystal dragon.  The decor was very oriental yet contemporary.  Let me start of with a disclaimer though- you cannot compare this place to Wing Lei, as other reviewers have done.  Not only is Red 8 in the casual dining tier versus Wing Lei's fine dining classification, but Red 8 is meant to cater to a different crowd.  Tourists, yes, but a different type of tourist.  One who doesn't want to splurge on food, just wants something quick to eat, or wants a Pan-Asian meal because essentially, that is what Red 8 serves.  A reviewer earlier described this place pretty accurately- a Panda Express on steroids.  Just throw in some Indonesian, Thai, and Cantonese dishes in there and you're all set.  The food was pretty good- nothing stunning, but something worth its money.  I had the pineapple fried rice, which was very nice since I don't know of any other restaurant that makes that.  And actually, we were all mooching off of each others' dishes, so I can't remember everything I ate!  All I know is that I would go to Red 8 again- not too often, but if there's a small occasion to celebrate.  I'm giving this place 3 stars because of the food.  Noodles Restaurant and other casual dining restaurants that are similar to Red 8 deliver much better in terms of food.  I can't fault the service- it was flawless.  They were vibrant and worth going back just for to see them again.  Sadly, I can't say the same for the food.",

But I can get better chow fun just 5 minutes away on Spring Mountain Road or even better, at a ghetto place in Monterey Park!   Anyways, I came here yesterday for lunch. We ordered: abalone congee, yang chow fried rice, two different vegetables (not sure what the English name is, but that doesn't matter), wonton noodles, and various dim sum dishes.   The abalone congee was around $25, but the whole time I thought \"where is the abalone?\" I seriously think they shredded a few pieces of abalone in there to officially charge that much (..obviously). The yang chow fried rice was really delicious, I give them street cred for that one. The wonton noodles were good, but it didn't taste authentic Asian. It tasted quite Americanized, especially the soup base. Fail. As far as the dim sum goes, it was actually quite tasty -- yes, all of it. It was on the more expensive side, around $6-$12 per dim sum dish, which is actually quite expensive for dim sum.   Our bill for 4 people came out to around $120. Not bad for the Wynn. But if I went to a place in Chinatown, the same food (with the same taste, if not better) would probably have been $40 bucks. Gotta love it.",

Obviously he thought he was going to get bigger tips from them...turns out he was right.  It didn't have to be that way though.    Here is my tip to the Red 8 wait staff:  Don't make the customers ask you for everything; if all their glasses are empty ask them if they need some more water or another drink.  If they would like to box up the uneaten portion of their dinner, box it all up instead of half.  Ask them if they'd like dessert or anything else before you drop the check on their table.  Most importantly, even if your opinion is to the contrary, treat them as if they deserve to be dining in your fine restaurant.",

Then it takes forever just to get our drinks. I mean, our appetisers arrived before our drink and she even ordered the wrong appetiser. If you dont want to work there then go home and send someone else.  I ordered a $22 singapore laksa because they said its their specialty. The noodles were so small portion and although the soup taste good, I realised they probably put lots of msg cos I am thirsty for the rest of the evening. My fiancee ordered an eggplant noodle and yet theres not a single eggplant in it, I think she ordered a pork feet for her instead. We are too hungry to care so we just carry on munching  on those little portion of foods.  You spent $70 and u are still hungry, man, should've gone to chinatown.   Anyway, when they delivered the bill, it was ridiculous, they put some stuff that we didnt even ordered. CHECK UR BILL BEFORE YOU PAID.  Absolutely make sure you CHECK UR BILL!!!

We had the Curry Vermicelli noodle dish along with the chicken satay app. We also tried the sweet & sour chicken. Everything was phenomenal and it really hit the spot! It was all that is good about eating Chinese food, but I felt less guilty since it was so obviously prepared with fresh ingredients.  Our waitress was extremely welcoming as well.

Then you would be asked to come back in an hour even there probably empty tables inside. After we sat down and waited for almost half an hour, no one came to serve us not even asked if we need a drink. A waitress cleaned up the table right next to us dropped a glass on the floor and the broken pieces splashed all over the floor right next to us and of course under our table. No one came to apologize. Finally, this waiter walked over to us and asked if he could take our order. We said: yes, of course. But can you please give us a glass of water please? And then he walked away without saying anything and never came back. I saw him murmured to his colleague saying something like they only wanted water! Eventually we had to walk up and asked someone else to take our order. The food was not fresh and completely overpriced compared to other nice restaurants with excellent service. After we paid the bill, the waiter came to us to take the receipt and opened it up to see how much tip we gave before we left!!! THIS WAS SO RUDE AND DISGUSTING!!!! I think I am very nice enough to leave a tip and didn't make a complaint in public. However, this was the worst service I got ever in the United States. I will never ever come back again.
