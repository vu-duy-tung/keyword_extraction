    "text": "Second time here. First time service was... Interesting. He seemed like he was just hanging out and didn't care? I don't know. Food was ok. I had already told myself I wouldn't be back. Then I saw on Instagram they had a new item, fried pickles. Looked great. Tought I'd give them another chance. Service was worse this time. Our sever stared us down when she got to the table, it was really weird but I thought it must be me. So we get our food pretty quick. I asked for the red hot spicy pickles, they were no where near. She was nice when I asked about it but I decided to just eat them as is. I had ordered a water and took a sip and tasted something sweet. Weird right? Water that tastes sweet? Hm... So the night goes on, we get the check and I notice our server in the back corner staring at me talking to another worker behind the bar. Interesting... There was a problem with the check and I told my wife, \"well she's starting at us, want me to wave her over?\" She ended up just going to the host as our server stayed talking to the other girl and STARING! It was so weird. So since she was staring, she saw my wife at the hostess and went over and asked what the problem was. She had a total attitude. I don't get it. When my wife told her what was wrong she said, \"well that's not a problem,\" and TOOK THE CHECK OUT OF HER HAND! Ok. Fine. Well right before leaving my wife found LIPSTICK on her glass. So our glasses weren't clean. No wonder my water tasted sweet. We won't be back. I just hope a manager sees this and does something about it because there won't be a third chance.",

Recently I've been into bbq burgers w/onion rings and the one I ordered from here was pretty legit. Hubby and sissy ordered the Farm Burger which came w/a fried egg and according to them yummy as well.

I am not a big fan of overly breaded chicken fingers, but that is just my preference. The chicken finger itself had no flavor at all, just tasted oily and it was just very crunchy. The sauce that it came with was definitely the exception to the whole meal. I think it was their specialty sauce. I can't seem to remember what the name was. The establishment was super clean which is always an upside. I did notice that everyone was enjoying their burgers a lot! Maybe their burgers are much better.

For me personally, its heat certainly held up to its name. Definitely not for the faint of heart. Bill was very attentive to everything we needed. I will certainly go again but for something less hot. Fried pickles were good also.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. I was with my ex and the kids closing out our Las Vegas trip and we were wandering around Downtown Vegas trying to find a decent restaurant that wasn't a horribly overpriced chain.   At our first choice - Hash House a Go Go - we were virtually ignored by staff. I mean seriously, we were standing at the hostess counter for about 10 minutes and none of the staff acknowledged us or came to seat us - thanks a lot, a**holes!  By the time we walked the entire length of Fremont Street we stumbled upon this restaurant by accident and were starving. I love EAT in Downtown Las Vegas however we needed a kid-friendly place that could get the food out promptly as everyone was pretty \"hangry\" (hungry+angry) by the time we got there.  PROS: -It's brand new so everything is very clean and in good condition.  -Cashier was friendly and professional, seeming to go out of her way to address our concerns (more on that below).  -Has a variety of items on the menu and the frozen custard desserts are something different.  CONS: -We ordered the Banana Monkey frozen custard and it DID NOT look anything close to the pictures on the menu board. It didn't have any bananas or other toppings in it, and frankly looked pretty pathetic. To their credit, when we complained to the cashier who took our order, she brought us a second frozen custard that was prepared correctly at no charge.  -Food overall was pretty \"meh,\" really nothing to write home. If you're solely a burger joint, you really have to nail it, IMO. Price didn't seem worth it as the food was pretty average.  As Fremont Street is pretty tourist-trappy, you could do worse however in hindsight I wish we went to Pizza Rock instead. Could our grumpiness have attributed to the lower rating? I don't think so. Am hoping some of the issues are related to their \"new-ness\" and that they eventually get the kinks out to can improve operations and quality.",

After my cousin accidentally left his backpack as we were catching our Uber, we called them when we got to our hotel and Jessica had it. Even though they just closed they still answered the phone and after asking some questions about the backpack to confirm it was ours we came back to the restaurant and picked it up. I tried to give her a $5 tip for her honesty and time, which was all I had on me(it's Vegas don't judge me hahaha) she wouldn't take it. So thankful there are still good people in the world, especially in Vegas!   I just called the manager and let him know what a great job his employees did and how good the food was! In a world where we are so quick to say something when people do something negative, we forgot to praise when people do a great job. Great job Jessica! We were so impressed!   Keep making great burgers and fries flipping burgers, and keep hiring good honest employees that provide great customer service!    Cheers!",

Mainly they are known for their burgers fries and shakes. There are a good amount to choose from. I actually tried the mushroom philly which was vegetarian. Nice bun with mushrooms peppers and onions. We also got two shakes and some onion rings.   The shake was good but when they say medium you think it'll be bigger than what I got. I was let down by the size of the shake. They don't even show you the sizes so I regret that choice  Kiara (I think that was her name) was either new, not fully trained or just didn't wana be there. No smile at all, her voice said I don't want to be here. She didn't know how to ring in things and took 3 people to complete our order, one being a cook.... Yes let that sink in....the cook was helping the cashier...  The manager was there and yet not doing anything to help speed up this transaction. She didn't even notice our burgers took over 15 minutes to make with no one else inside...as a manager you have to be aware of your guests and ticket times.  Place is clean for sure.   Would I come back? If I was down town and wanted a burger for cheap yes I would. With all the restaurants surrounding I can go somewhere else and get my stuff faster and be around employees who want to work where they are!",

The burgers are good but the staff are unpleasant and disrespectful.  The music is frequently too loud; the servers are often sarcastic and nasty.  Good burger.  Horrible service.  If you want to deal with heartburn after a good burger, this is the place for you.  I will not be going back. Spoke with the manager who is out of touch with how rude her new hired servers and bar staff are, she needs to fire most of them.  I was a regular, from the beginning of the business, and a big tipper: I am never going back, nor will I recommend this place to my friends going forward.  I am a Vegas and Downtown local.",

The Vegas heat was a little much in terms of heat to flavor that I like but I can see it being a very solid contender for the go to if my heat tolerance goes up. Also had the strawberry fields (I think) drink and it was very delicious.  Basically this is solidified in my opinion to be a \"you have to go here if you're around Fremont Street\" establishment. Delicious and kudos!",

I ordered the Nashville Chicken Sandwich and it was delicious ! I always share my plate with my boyfriend because I don't eat a lot and it was perfect size when cut in half!!! The chicken was juicy and delicious ! The buns were soft yet perfect!   I added some fries to my order and ordered a draft beer and that was enough for me ! My sister ordered the chicken tenders and loved them!  Everything was delicious and my boyfriend and sister were satisfied with both the food/drinks and the service!! Everyone was super nice and we got our food promptly.   The restrooms were nice and clean. It's a restaurant/bar and they have plenty of Tvs to entertain you while you eat.  Music was upbeat and perfect for Saturday night!!   I visit Vegas 3 times a year and I'm always looking for good food spots! So When I'm in Vegas again I will come back !!! All the way from Long Beach!!  Sorry no pictures we were starving and forgot to capture our food moment !!!  Also check in for a sweet discount!!!",

    "text": "My wife and I were on Fremont Street in Las Vegas on a Tuesday afternoon and we were in search of some cool places to go for happy hour. We walked by Flippin' Good and saw a sandwich board advertising their happy hour insinuating great deals so we decided to check it out.  When we sat down at the bar, we asked the bartender what their happy hour deals were. He said that we could get a Bud Light for $3, a Coors Light for $3, or we could get half of each mixed together for $3. He then proceeded to laugh at his own joke (I'm using the term loosely here) for a solid ten seconds. Those happy hour deals sounded pretty lame to us so we decided to just order some chicken bites. A few minutes later though, he came back saying that he \"spoke with his manager\" and that he could offer a deal that basically amounted to $2-3 off of any beer. This was a much better deal although I'm not sure why we had to go through the whole rigamarole.   We tried a flight of local Las Vegas beers and a plate of chicken bites which were accompanied by buffalo and cluckin' sauce. The chicken was tasty and both of the sauces added a nice amount of spice to the chicken. The flight offered a diverse array of beers: a pale ale, amber ale, lager, and a double IPA. None of the beers were super impressive, but maybe Las Vegas just doesn't have much of a craft beer scene yet.   Overall, the chicken was pretty good. The happy hour negotiation was weird. Not sure if we would come back.",

Our server originally recommended the flippin to which we felt like would be too spicy - even though we love spicy foods. We opted for Vegas and holy sh** I wanted to die. It's not that the spice itself was too much but it was the sheer amount that choked you up.   Staff can forsure do a better job here explaining the flavors to better inform guests. Also, didn't appreciate after our meal, the server Saul telling us he likes to get people to order the flippin just to watch them suffer.  Meals are suppose to be good and fill you up. I ended up taking 3 bites of my food - dying and filling up on ranch fries.",

I guess they think everyone is a tourist so service doesn't matter.  We finally just left after about 15 minutes.  It was NOT busy. As a local I will never \"try\" this place again.  This is our favorite area of Vegas to take visitors, eat and have fun.  Too many other places with better service and friendlier staff.",

The flippin fries are like in and out's animal style fries. The fries themselves were on the soggy side which I didn't enjoy. However, I actually thought the flippin sauce was better than the spread on the animal fries. With that said, in and out fries are still way better. Go for the onion rings instead. They were so on point! Real talk, I'd go back just for the onion rings.",

    "text": "Flippin' Good is a flippin' cheap option for Fremont Street eats- two can easily dine under $20, and that's with a side and dessert to share! I was excited about this spot opening but hesitant to visit given the generally-underwhelmed reviews, but their claims of freshness eventually tempted me through the door.   BURGERS: The menu lists single- and double-burgers for each style, I opted for the classic and realized why. The patty thickness is somewhere between White Castle and Dollar Menu Double. Props for offering a lettuce-wrapped version. Beef quality, like all the other reviews, lends itself to a less-favorable comparison to that West coast chain. The turkey burger retained a surprising juiciness and the toppings were fresh. FRIES: The regular variety are lightly salted, but if your a fan of spice, opt for the Flippin' Spicy style. I openly admit that these were WAY too spicy for me, with tons of chopped grilled jalapenos in every nook and cranny. These were perfectly topped too: so much cheese and pepper that it was difficult to find bare fries, even at the bottom. A win for most people, a lose for me, because it rendered the dish inedible, but this is entirely my fault. CONCRETE:  A few specialty versions for a sweet dessert treat, BF opted for the Brownie Delight, whose chocolaty tones were reminiscent of a Frosty, in a good way. The 10oz small is just the right size and the bits of brownie blended in added a nice texture that didn't take away from the overall creaminess.  Service was quick and cheery, space is clean and welcoming with framed, mirrored windows on the walls lending a farm-house feeling. This is a nice addition to the area given their relatively low price point and the fact that they deliver on their promised freshness. But it's not the kind of meal I'll cross town for, nor one I can justify paying a parking fee to access due to the location. Outside of the downtown area, I'd probably be more inclined to give them another try.",

Ever since it switched management, the focus is less on the food and more on making it look like a country dive bar. The pieces were raised, the quality was lowered and the sports are turned up to an 11. They switched the black and white tiles of a diner for trashy brick and steel to look like every other place in dtlv. It looks like a college bar now; not a welcome addition to Fremont Street.   The waiters and wait staff are rude, the tables are dirty and the food takes forever. I miss the old Flippin. :(  Update: currently eating here. Waiter is mad at us for some reason. Just dropped off straws and our drinks after 20 minutes. Straws are opened and stepped on, thanks guy!",

I also had a Daisy Duke (drink) - that I would skip it was very watered down and zero fizz (was supposed to have cream soda).

When it was the diner looking spot, the staff was friendly, there was smiles, it was welcoming. Now the bar spot, although more modern and in the tune of neighboring spots....just seems weird. It's an off vibe. We were seated and just saw the wait staff doing their normal routine as if no one new was seated. No nods of hello, no mention of \"be right to you\", not even the occasional glance in the customer's direction. Seemed very weird. Once the waiter came who is also a bartender things went ok I guess. The order was correct and it tasted good but that's it. Nothing is memorable or keeps me returning but the food. Customer service can definitely take the same renovation effort as the stylish change. We had the impossible burger ( a vegan's dream) and the farm burger (carnivore dream). Flippin amazing but we also had blah service. Imma be back though.",

They have plenty of TVs for sports and a decent sized bar.   I tried the Nashville hot chicken sandwich with fries. The chicken was breaded and seasoned well, but the meat was a little dry and bland. The fries were the best part for me! Freshly made and on the thicker side, which is usually not my preference.   Service is good, but unfortunately on my visit there was an employee walking around the floor doing basically nothing but eating...and drinking. Taking a premixed shot was the first thing she did after stepping on the floor. Super uncool from a health-code standard and it's what drags this review down from a solid 4 stars.   If I was in the downtown area and needed a meal, I'd consider it, but won't be making a point to come back any time soon.",

Right across the street was a locals hangout called Flippin Good Chicken and Burgers. I got there at 11:45 . I ordered the old fashioned which came with fries. It arrived quickly.  Excellent burger and delicious fries. Huge portion I might add. It was $10.95 for the burger and the fries.  I'll be back next time to try the chicken sandwich.",

I'm not rating them overall, I'm just rating their vegan burger because that's the only thing I've had since they changed their menu.   Personally the vegan burger is usually good however this last time I did notice the bread was very dry and it literally crumbled when I bit into it plus the burger was just dry. I know this isn't always the case but I was very taken back because usually their food is on point. I ordered  their onion rings and those never fail. They're always very crunchy, the flavor is all in the batter and they've always been consistent. Like I said today I'm just ranting about the Vegan burger because I was a bit disappointed since I could've just gone somewhere else to have a solid vegan burger.",

I'm now even embarrassed to say that when my cousin (who's a local) suggested this spot, my first thought was \"Did we really come all the way here for chicken sandwiches?\" Well, this was the best chicken sandwich I've ever had hands down. I got the Nashville with Nashville level heat & it packed a punch. The chicken itself is cooked perfectly and the breading basically melts in your mouth. Not thick or cakey at all! I didn't even notice the sweet pickles with the spice of the sandwich, it all just went together so well!  Definitely a must next time we're visiting again!",

    "text": "It was super late coming, thanks GrubHub. The fries were cold and didn't taste good. The burger was covered in soooooo much condiment gloop that's all I could taste. It made the bun slip right if the burger, or is it the burger slipped right off the bun?  Either way, it was not fun eating. After most of the mayo, ketchup and mustard fell on my shirt, lap and couch.... and covered my fingers, I was over this meal. Ended up using a fork and knife to eat it. Lame. And threw away the top bun that was soggy form the condiments.  It should be spread on the bun, not 2 tablespoon dollops of each on the bun. So inedible. I did get the salad with fried chicken pieces that was actually really good.  But other than that ... not my favorite place to get a burger. Ask for toppings on the side. And maybe just eat if there so the fries are fresh. When you put them in those cardboard containers that are lined with wax sealant inside, the food steams and the moisture then makes everting soggy, especially the fries. And it was cold out, so when the driver brought it, it was just in a bag, and not a warming carrier tote. It should be mandatory that they all have access or ability to have a hot and cold carrier. Depending on what you order.",

The fare definitely did not wow.  In my opinion, In n Out's flavors are superior.    We got the Bacon Cheeseburger, Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Onion Rings, & Flippin Fries, with Huckleberry and Pumpkin Pie milkshakes.  The Cheeseburger and Chicken were bland & overly greasy on stale buns, and the onion rings were overcooked.  The shakes were cloyingly sweet and artificial tasting.  Overall, we just did not enjoy the items we purchased at Flippin Good, but the space itself is very nice and clean for a fast food restaurant.",

They used to have a 20% off Yelp check-in, but the last time I was there  I didn't see it up on the page.  The menu has various burger, chicken sandwiches, fries, onion rings, and vegetarian options. If you have room then definitely indulge in one of their sinfully epic ice cream treats. I usually go for the flippin' cheeseburger with flippin' fries (their version of animal style fries) and a beer. Everything is made to order and comes out freshly delicious. This place is definitely better than nasty Shake Shack on the Strip. Overall, if you're in Downtown Las Vegas and are craving some burgers then make this place a spot to check out.",

It's not a sit-down type place with table cloths and what not, but if you're looking for a decent burger and fries (and maybe a shake?) then this'll do ya.  If I'm not mistaken they do serve beer as well, so this could serve as a burger-and-beer spot without the character of a more pricey, wood-paneled type place. Service was good when I was here, but I don't expect much from these types of restaurants. They took the order, and brought the food out when it was ready. Win-win.",

Had a side of chili cheese fries, the cheese wasn't even melted on top and it tasted like tomato sauce fries pretty much. My boyfriend ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and it was just okay, he also had a lemonade that tasted like tap water. Overall, the server was amazing, hispanic girl, name started with a \"V\" , very sweet!! She literally was the only good thing about this place, for almost $30 it wasn't worth the price and I don't think i'll come back. Also, given the location I understand there will be drunk people but there were two overly loud groups who kept bumping into chairs and one guy was humping another person. Very distracting when you just want to eat but again it's downtown so can't do much about that I guess.",

Usually by midnight all the vegan spots I know are far and closed. But thank god for flipping good chicken they're open until 2 am! The hostess was so nice outside the door as she went to seat us. Our server came out immediately with ice water which I needed desperately haha and took our order and recommended a alcoholic beverage called a Tennessee tea that was super yummy! We didn't wait long for our food to come out and while we waited they had good music playing, a little Carrie Underwood and Blake Shelton it gave a nice modern country vibes.. Our food was delish like always never any complaints it always stays consistent which is another plus! This place is seriously a must try if your a vegan or carnivore there's something for everyone and yummy cocktails, beers. I will be back again soon! If I'm not in the area they also offer Postmates so I don't even have to leave the house to get a yummy vegan chicken burger..",

Their website has a banner on the front page which proclaims \"keepin' it vegetarian\" advertising the Garden Burger and Portobello Philly. They've apparently removed these options from the menu.   I would strongly advise management to at least bring the garden burger patty back to give veggie people an option. Also, the new beer selection is lame, all lagers and IPAs and domestics.

    "text": "What could be considered my LIB HQ, I had quite a few meals at Flippin' Good last weekend. My order was always a double turkey burger (extra pickles, mustard), a side of fries and a water. Total: $7.xx. I know you can find some cheap eats on Freemont, but anytime you can REALLY stuff yourself for under $8, I'm a fan. As for the food itself, it wasn't half bad. Like others have mentioned, it's a step above a McD's, but probably a step down from a BurgerFi or Smashburger. Much respect for having a potato bun, 'merican cheese, fresh veggies (which you can ask them to pile on) and a legit sized patty. The Flippin Sauce on the burg' is no Animal Style from I&O or Mac Sauce, but it's not the worst. Bottom line, when intoxicated or in need of a relatively quick and inexpensive meal, this place isn't a bad place to be. Coat that stomach and rage on!   Note: it takes 7-10 minutes to get your order. Prepare for that.",

I went with the bacon cheeseburger single meat patty with cheese fries. The burger was descent. Reminds me of the other burger chain. Ahem. It was okay. The cheese fries were good. Drenched in cheese. The onion rings were crunchy and tasty. Pretty descent burgers. Food was about $30 including a milkshake my daughter got.   Once you order, you get a number and they bring you your food. The lady at the register was super nice and friendly. They also serve Coke products here. A plus in my book. There are plenty of tables to sit inside. Restaurant is cool and the best part is there is music playing from Justin Bieber to all the R&B hip hop music. I feel great vibes in here. Makes me want to dance. I am singing the words to Sorry by Justin Bieber. Love the music.",

We walked up to the counter to order our food and was immediately impressed with their staff that took our order. She was very friendly. We ordered a Flippin' Good Cheeseburger Double patty-$7.45 Bacon Cheeseburger single-5.95 Kids Grilled Cheese-$1.95 Flippin' Fries-$4.25 Onion Rings-$3.95 Fountain drink large-$2.65 x2 Brownie Delight-$4.25 Total tab-$35.80  The food came out fast and everything tastes delicious. Onion rings was very crunchy and fresh. Burgers were great tasting and fries was also delicious as well with the grilled onions and Flippin' sauce. The Cherry Coke was tasting awesome because it was set to the right syrup / Soda water setting. Brownie Delight was very delicious too.  We definitely will be back when we are in the downtown area and craving a great burger and milkshake.",

It took a LONG time for our drinks to come our (just water for 5 people). Then our food took a while to come out too. BF ordered a flight that never arrived and he asked for dipping sauce that arrived towards the end of our meal.   I really hope that this only happened because we were the only group sitting outside.

(I'm from Florida)   The staff is super friendly and very prompt! The waitress, I believe her name was Reyna, super helpful and recommended the spicy chicken sandwich and spicy jalapeno fries. TRY THIS PLACE !!   Btw it was probably the cheapest place I've gone to in Vegas (price wise) and the food was amazing.",

Th sandwich was so big I had to sit for a while just to finish 3/4 of it ( may have been more of the heat, not sure).  The fries were good too but I would go with the onion rings! Worth it!  The service was really good too! Our waitress gave great recommendations.  I wish we had more room for dessert because I hear the milkshakes and \"concrete\" are very good as well.  Definitely worth a try if you are in downtown Vegas!",

My friends got the chicken sandwich which was already spicy at the level it came at and my boyfriend swears it was one of the best he's ever had.   The breading kind of crumbled off the chicken, so it was dry and crunchy but overall it was good. If I'm looking for a good quick meal on Fremont I'm sure I'll return.",

The wait at some places was outrageous so when we got here, we were glad to hear that they had a table open. I didn't really expect much from this burger place but the hot chicken sandwich (just as good as Nashville's) and bacon cheese burger were pretty damn good. I was really surprised. My daughter also ordered one of their featured milkshakes and enjoyed it. I will definitely be looking for this place the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Fremont is an area blessed with an abundance of boutique bars, the liquor flows all too freely here, its the part of town that your liver would have nightmares about.  At some point as you stumble down this neon street of non sobriety chances are you'll come to following realization. \"Christ, I'm wasted!!! I better eat something!\" Yes. Yes you should. And what better to eat than a crispy chicken sandwich topped with everything a plastered patron needs to get back in the game.  What you need is something to sop up some of your bad decisions, what you need is the \"Dirty Bird\".   Cheese. Check Bacon. Check Egg. Check.  The holy trinity of hangover helpers atop a juicy, crispy slab of bird. Side of fries and you got yourself a downtowns most delicious second wind.  It's so good that one day I may just eat one sober.",

    "text": "One of the worst qualities a restaurant can have is a rude and bad manager and that is exactly what this restaurant has.   I went in last weekend with my boyfriend late at night and ordered two meals. Soon after after we ordered we noticed an employee went up to the front and started turning costumers away and letting them know that they would not be taking orders orders for another 20 min due to being super behind. This went on for a while so we decided to ask him why it was taking so long to get our food, he replied that the grill at the restaurant can only take so many burgers and that they couldn't make too many orders at a time.    We spent a while looking around at the same 6 people that were before us and they still did not have their food either. They had two different people pick orders to go (nothing too big) but the whole time the staff just talked, brought signs in from the outside and didn't seem concerned or stressed about the people waiting.   Let me just say that I've seen more of a hustle at McDonald's!!! I couldn't believe my mind. More than 30 min went by and we still didn't have our food so we decide to go to the manager at the front and ask for a refund because we were starving. The manager decided to reply \"we told you it would be 15 min\" my boyfriend then asked him to see what time the check was printed and he then realized that it had been over 30 min and said, \"oh well your food is ready\" my boyfriend told him off and reminded him that a \"manager\" should always apologize for making people wait for ridiculous amount of time for their \"fast food\" and never give a smart ass reply when being asked for a refund. He then realized his mistake and gave us our money back but with a side of attitude.   I can't see this place lasting long, if you can't handle a busy Fremont street or have good management with employees that move their feet then don't expect to succeed.   I'll never go back.",

As a single female vacationing to Vegas, he and another staff member off-the-clock made me feel safe and welcomed. Perfect late night food right off the plane.",

They have outdoor (2 large picnic tables) and indoor seating with plenty of TVs to watch sports on. We opted for outdoors since the weather was perfect!  Our waiter was friendly and came over right away. The items on the menu are very affordable, especially for a place on Freemont Street in Downtown Las Vegas.  We ordered the bacon burger with avocado and chili cheese fries. Despite being from Texas, where we love our Whataburger and meat, we genuinely enjoyed the burger. It was a perfect size and very flavorful. The patty itself is on the thin side (so get double meat if you're not easily satisfied) but with the bacon, aged cheddar, and avocado, it all comes together beautifully and is a True portion. The chili cheese fries were good too.  Overall, a tasty and affordable place in Downtown Las Vegas.",

I visited last night with a friend and the cashier, Rachelle, didn't accurately enter my order - for the third consecutive visit to this place. I ordered the farm burger, 2 patties with all of the toppings in a lettuce wrap - what I always order.   This time, I got a sad looking single patty with cheese, an egg and two pieces of bacon on it. Not what I ordered.   Luckily, Rachelle has great co workers who have fixed her mistakes each time and delivered a delicious final product. The management needs someone on the register to can communicate clearly and take orders with small modifications. With that fix, this place will definitely get a better rating from me.",

They have sides to choose from that are free which is a bonus because typically you go somewhere and they charge you for jalepenos and grilled onions...extra sauce etc. I ordered a turkey burger and surprisingly it was good. Not rubbery like places tend to be and fair prices. It is definitely a good place to get food downtown instead of cheap greesy mess in the hotels nearby.

I ordered the old fashion burger and I asked for no tomatoes but add pickles... brought it to my table and it was the total opposite, a full tomato and with no pickles! I was already bitter at that point. Another order that they messed up was my friend. He ordered the flippin' onion fries and when it came out NO ONIONS it was just cheese (not even good cheese) and fries! Now I am mad. Last ordered they messed up was my boyfriends. He ordered the farm burger and asked for no grilled onions and what do you know, IT CAME WITH GRILLED ONIONS! I was furious at that point, I just stopped eating and left. I mean, who messes up every single order when we asked for none of the above? The funny thing was, the family behind us also had there order messed up. There food wasn't that good anyways, I've had better. So, I do not recommend this place.. unless you want to see for yourself.",

    "text": "Quick Look - Going to be a \"Fast Food\" or \"Fast Casual\" game changer in Downtown, Las Vegas. Quality establishment with some tasty burgers, fresh potato French-fries and real ice cream milk shakes / custard \"concrete\" deserts. Did I mention draft beers too?   Was there for the \"soft opening\" today and they knocked it out of the park. Bright white decor throughout - might be an issue keeping clean in the future? Right now it works, and the inside looks great. They have rock music playing over the speakers and a giant 70 inch high definition TV on the wall. The menu consist of burgers. Some with bacon, some with jalapenos, some with all of the above (and then some). You can order them as single or double patties. They even have a turkey burger on the menu. The French-fries are delicious and come from fresh cut potatoes.   I spoke with management and they have plans to stay open until 3am on busy weekend nights / mornings. I expect their late night traffic will be strong with the busy nightlife next-door. Burger combo with a large fries and drink cost about $13. Personally, this is what Downtown needed. I think they are going to succeed in this location and I wish them success with this new restaurant.   Without hesitation that I recommend Flippin' Good Burgers and Shakes. Good people, and good food.",

The Inside is big and spacious easily able to sit the late night rush and/or the drunk crowds. They have a huge ultra HD TV hanging in the middle wall playing mordern/today's popular music videos.  Double Farm Burger (fried egg, grilled onion, smoked bacon, ketchup and melted american cheese) with Onion Rings and regular 16oz Martin & Lewis (vanilla milkshake) came to the total of $14.75. The price is ok but if you only get the burger and onion rings, the amount would be around $10. The prices of the burgers, fries, onion rings are pretty standard but the quality of the food is delicious.  The onions rings are thick cut, well battered and perfectly fried. Everytime I took a bite, it made a wonderful crunch and the onion itself stayed intact with the fried exterior. Nothing is more disappointing when the onion itself is not intact with the fried exterior. The burger is really good, reminds of Steak n Shake and I love Steak n Shake. The vanilla milkshake was delicious as well but Is it a $5 milkshake? Overall a great burger joint in downtown Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I'm updating my review from three stars to four based on my most recent visit to Flippin' Good in downtown Las Vegas. On my first visit, I was extremely excited to visit Flippin' Good because I'd been looking for an old fashioned burger and custard place here in Vegas. The store is very nice on the inside, with wide booths and evenly spaced tables, a small counter area with bar stools, and a large flatscreen TV. The outside looks a little hastily painted (as the door handles are already chipping) but it's still very presentable and attractive.   One of the best qualities of this restaurant is how amazingly CLEAN everything is (a rarity for eateries on Fremont Street). If the employees aren't taking orders or cooking food, they are going around wiping down tables and mopping the floors.   I had to wait momentarily to place my order as all employees were busy, but the employee who came over apologized sincerely for my wait and patiently took my order. She made sure to carefully make adjustments to my husband's burger (no toppings beside the bacon and cheese), and asked us to make sure that the order on the screen was correct. She had accidentally punched in a 2-patty turkey burger for me but quickly changed it to 1 when I pointed it out.  Be prepared to wait a little bit for your food (approximately 7-8 minutes), but that's because everything is made fresh and piping hot! My husband LOVED his bacon cheeseburger, and while I enjoyed the fresh toppings and homemade bun, my turkey burger was extremely salty. I'll probably just stick with a regular beef burger next time.   I went back up to the counter and order a brownie concrete (and added banana for 50 cents). At first the concrete was hard to eat (the lid isn't large enough for a spoon to fit through, and the overflow of concrete spilled out onto the counter when I took the lid off), but the combination of brownies, banana, and smooth custard was BOMB!   I'm sure my husband and I will visit again soon.",

The flavor wqs on point! My husband had the hamburger well done and fries.  It was juicy and flavorful.  Now, my fried order \"grilled\" chicken salad and it came to the table with fried breaded chicken. It was still good but server suggested just to keep it beause it would just take longer to eat . Ugh ok . Then my friends husband ordered the hamburger with the fried egg and requested the egg with \" no\" yolk. Well that came to the table with the egg drooling with yolk again server suggested it would take too long to remake ugh ok .  Also, my fried ordered the white wine and was brought rose but server quickly replaced. I dont kow if it was just an off day for either the server or cook but for half of the order to be wrong i must admit i was expecting some kind of discount. But , the check came and nope not even 1% off. Im not the type to ask but it would have  definitely been a plus in my book if they would have been more apologetic about all the mess ups and sweeten the bill with a comp or discount...  We will try this place again if we are in area. The food was very much worth it.",

    "text": "Decided to try this after viewing their website and seeing a burger that sounded delish. Once we arrived we were told they had just changed their menu so items we went for were no longer available. Was told they were trying to be more of \"chicken\" place. Decided to go ahead and try it.....and was quickly disappointed.  Ice tea was awful and tasted like instant tea in a jar. Ordered chicken bites with the flipping good sauce. Chicken was nothing spectacular but wasn't bad. The flipping good sauce had a good flavor. Decided to try the fire fries as we both enjoy spicy food....this however was a huge disappointment. It was such an awful flavor we literally only ate 2-3 fries each. Hubby also ordered a Boulevard that he said tasted like it was bad. Waiter walked passed and we tried to stop him numerous times but he kept going. Finally got him to stop so we could order a different drink. Waiter never even asked if something was wrong and when we attempted to say something he walked off. Then after 15-20 min he walks passed and slams down the new drink. Tried to get him to stop several more times to see about getting more flipping good sauce but he was more interested in watching tv. When he finally came by we were able to get him to stop, tried to ask for more sauce and tried to advise him that the fries were terrible. He shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Then after waiting another 15 plus minutes we had to ask the lady up front who seats you, if we could pay our bill. She advised us the server has to take care of it. After her trying to get the waiters attention, she too gave up and got a lady from the back (guessing manager/owner) to ring us up and cash us out. Terrible service and overall not great food for the price. Definitely won't recommend or return.",

Gomer and I stopped by because we saw a sign board out front advertising Huckleberry shakes and we can't pass up a good huckleberry product! We were met by a very friendly young man named John that gave us the run down on the vittles! Fresh handcut fries, never frozen and real ice cream shakes. We ordered the old fashioned double burger! The bun was soft, and toasted perfectly. The patties were not very large but had great flavor as did the toppings! The fries were hot and crispy! Our milk shakes were creamy and delicious! Overall we are completely satisfied with Flippin Good Burgers. Is this a gourmet burger joint... No.... But it's very clean, the food was very tasty and every one of the employees was friendly, pleasant and helpful!",

I went old school with a chocolate malt with whipped cream. OMG! I seriously believe this was the best malt I have ever tasted. Ever. In all my malt- slurping decades. Some places merely show the malt to the cup but you can't really taste it. Flippin out must dump it in because the malted milk was obviously present in the luscious chocolate creaminess and the whipped cream was real and delicious mixed in. The staff were super nice, and seemed happy, which suggests good treatment by management. Go now and prepare to spend a while savoring.",

They were very well staffed and the entire time we were there the staff was cleaning tables, walls, floors as well as checking on customers and making sure condiments were stocked.   The food to me was a cross between In N Out and maybe Culvers. The bun was really good and the burger patty was very reminiscent of In N Out. I'm a fan of thicker, more potatoey fries, so theirs hit the spot for me. I'm happy that as a downtown resident, I won't have to drive out of the neighborhood for a good fast food burger and fries. As someone with a major sweet tooth, I also really like that they have custard here too!",

    "text": "Overall assessment is average. I'm cutting this place some slack since its brand new, so here's the review.   The place is very nice inside and the location is great, right on Fremont and LV Blvd. I stopped in for lunch and ordered the \"Farm Burger\" and fries.  The food came out quick, I would guess around 8 minutes after I ordered. The meat was very plain, just tasted like decent quality beef with no seasoning at all. The bun, while soft, was very greasy. I don't know what the shiny stuff is all over it, I'm assuming butter or oil to give it the shine. It made my hands greasy with every bite. See the picture in the review. I liked how the bun was soft on top but toasted on the grill as well. The egg was slightly over cooked and wasn't runny, the bacon not crispy but more rubbery. Grilled onions were just there as well, not much depth of flavor.   The fries were ok but I was hoping for a little more crunch than the soft ones I got. This preference so I'm not factoring it into the star rating. Very lightly salted, but also a preference thing.   I'm still trying to find what will make this burger place different from all the others. Nothing about the food stood out as better than any other burger spot. Because it wasn't the worst burger I've had, and it's a convenient lunch spot, I'll give it one more go. When I go back, I'm going to just try a plain burger to see if it's better than one with all the extras like the farm burger has. I will update the review afterward",

IT DID!!! I ordered the farm burger. It had a fried egg, & bacon on it. OMG DELICIOUS!!!! It was pretty pricey, like $13, but damn was it good! So good I ordered another 1 to take back to my hotel room! Our server was pleasant, but disappeared a few times,  not quite sure what that was all about, but I'll definitely go back when I'm in town.",

You know how you normally have bread left and run out of meat? Well no not the case here. I ran outta bread before I could finish the chicken! That sandwich had to have been the best Nashville fried chicken sandwich ever. It was juicy, spicy, and just had the best flavors.   The service was excellent. We got our order in, drinks served, and order delivered in a timely manner. We went on a Thursday during the late afternoon. It wasn't too busy. It was nice and air conditioned too. There were plenty of tvs and a nice long bar up at the front of the restaurant. It's in the newly renovated downtown section of Fremont street. Definitely worth a bite to eat here.",

I think they were short staffed, I have no clue. Server Alexander comes over after sitting for a bit and takes drink orders. We are a larger group (6), everyone orders. Comes back with everyone's drinks. Doesn't bring the soda I ordered or a water for me. A friend asks for the water for me, he brings two. I ask for the Soda, it's like I'm bothering the guy at this point.   I really felt like I was a bother, I should've just stuck with the water because it seemed like he just didn't even want us there. Food comes out, it's definitely decent. Plenty of spice. Finish the soda, server comes by a few Times and never catches the need for a refill since he basically kept his back to me the whole time.   For $3 for a damn soda, give me a freaking refill. Whatever, who knows if we will come back. Our group was excited to try this place but it was flipping bad service.",

    "text": "Oh, Flippin' Good. How delicious you are. In all my life, I have never indulged in such succulent, moist (yes, MOIST,) flavorful, crispy chicken. Honestly, it is the best fried chicken I have ever eaten! I work Downtown and frequently order the Chicken Strips or the Dirty Bird sandwich (which is really delicious but extremely filling.)   Even their Texas Toast is mouth watering and the perfect juxtaposition of buttery, salty, thick and soft.   But be prepared to wait for your food. And I mean WAIT. It doesn't matter if there's one other table or completely packed, you WILL be waiting for your food for at least 25 minutes and that's being generous. I'm not saying it's not worth it (it is) but if you're in a rush, this is not the place to go.   My other disappointment is the service. I've been in a big group of 10, a group of 3 or 4 and even swung by for a pick-up and each time it's just really hit or miss.   Breanna is, by far the worse server in the joint. I hate calling people out, and she is very sweet, but I hope she's using her tip money to pay her way to a different career because this one is not for her. My party waited nearly 25 minutes just for water. Another 10 for it arrive, 20 for the food and another 20 to get the check AFTER we'd finished eaten. It wasn't that she \"didn't care\" it was more like she just completely oblivious. She wasn't adept at anticipating our (basic) needs nor was she even cognoscente of how long she had us waiting in the midst of a very, very empty restaurant.   Regardless, their food is superb, their happy hour is decent and you can't beat a free beer with the Yelp check-in. Next time, I'd love to try their milkshakes!",

Nonetheless I felt it was pretty tasteless and didn't eat much of it since it lacked flavor. Very odd to be honest. Burgers usually have great flavor with little effort.   I also got their fried pickles and didn't realize they were a weird spin off. I guess with buffalo and other spices? Really did NOT enjoy them and I LOVE fried pickles. I tasted two and that was it. Would def not order again.   Fries are very plain. I like some good seasoning on mine.",

The buns they use are the right amount of fluff and taste kind of sweet. They practically fall apart and they remind me of potato bread. The chicken - so flippin' juicy, so flippin' crispy. AND THE FRIES. They have these hot fries with jalapenos and cheese - maaahhh gawww - sooo good but definitely not for the one who can't handle the heat. If you can't handle the heat, they have their version of animal fries like in n out with the cheese, the sauce, and the grilled onions! Their specialty sauce is just like any specialty sauce that reminds you of thousand island and it's tasty!   I wanted to evaluate the menu before judging whether or not this place is flippin' good and it flippin' is. Service is awesome too! It can be about $10-12 a person, which is reasonable for the fresh ground beef patties or their fried chicken! Definitely a great spot to have a drink (there's a full bar) and grab a bite!",

It's a good thing I like my fries soggy, but some people might find them a little undercooked. I also don't like the fact that there is only ONE vegan item on the entire menu. They also use the same frier for all of the items, vegan or otherwise. The rest of my party enjoy their food though!  Unfortunately, my water tasted like pool water (i could taste the chlorine). My boyfriend tasted my water and said it didn't taste like the water he recieved. I would definitely recommend a Water Filtration or Reverse Osmosis for the restaurant.  The service was wonderful! The server was attentive, kind, and very patient. We recieved our food very quickly! The bathrooms are well kept, which is also a plus. They have plenty of TV screens to watch all of the sports games at once!   I hope they add more vegan items (like a milkshake!), so I can visit again!",

It wasn't bad food and the service was great so I give it 4 stars. I think I'm spoiled with all of my local haunts in my home state of Wisconsin. Go here if you find yourself without other options.",

    "text": "Great burgers, great fries and great shakes. Perfect for the late munchies. Very reasonable prices for what you get right outside the Fremont street experience. Dropped one star because they took off the Huckleberry from their Shake flavors; it was the best Shake flavor in town... RIP Since my review, Christina (The manager?) reached out, which is nice, saying they might reconsider in the future. There was no way to reply to her, but I just wanted to say that I understand it is a business decision, but I strongly believe it is a must-keep flavor if they just try to suggest it more. Everyone I suggested it to fell instantly in love with it; It is not as heavy or loaded as other flavors which are good too, but because most of my (and my roommate's trips) were specifically to get one of those (and a burger and fries of course), we decided it is not longer worth the frequent trip now that it is removed. We will still stop by when there of course, both the burgers and fries are delicious, but taking a star is my way of protesting the cancellation of this delicious and unique flavor which you cannot find anywhere else! I hope you bring it back someday....  :(((((",

    "text": "Flippin good indeed.  Located in the gateway to East Fremont this burger joint offers fresh made food that will soak up any booze you might have consumed during the evening....or day for that matter because day drinking is fun!  You start by ordering at the counter and you can choose 1,2 or three patties (classic, large, or extra large). Then they have their specialties that include the Flame, Farm, Old Fashioned, BBQ, Cheese, or Bacon Cheeseburgers.    This visit I went with the large Bacon Cheeseburger and it was delicious.  Topped with traditional lettuce and tomato and some Flippin good sauce and crispy bacon, this is the kind of meal I needed to cap off a night of cocktails and beers in DTLV.  The natural cut fries on the side were seasoned and cooked well.  With a good size portion of fries and a double patty I did not leave Flippin Good hungry.  Reasonable prices make this a win for East Fremont dining.    Next time I'm gonna try one of their shakes. Their promo on the wall was promoting a St Patrick's day flavor which I bet is a 1000 times better than a stinky Shamrock Shake from McD's.",

They \"took\" our order and gave us our water but that was the last of it.The waiters ignored our table we sat there for 35 minutes and no one checked up on us. When I finally talked to one of the servers they said they will check up on it, someone came by and spoke under his breathe and then went to another table. Didn't hear anything that he muttered. They obviously forgot about us. They offered no apologies so we left and this will be the last time we are going back.",

The burgers were tasty and well constructed  and full of fresh ingredients, but they were not falling apart, soggy or difficult to bite. Limitless sides and extra ingredients. The contents of the burger stayed in between the buns til the end, as long as I don't get TOO many extra ingredients lol  It did exceed our expectations. Very good food, the prices were decent and the staff were great. Helpful, friendly, attentive, and quick. Simple menu with more than a few choices.

    "text": "The good: Casual eating smack in the middle of the Eastern Freemont Downtown action, reasonably priced for the location- burgers start at around $5, but are served a-la cart.  Clean, bright and family friendly. Beer on tap, and thank you lord, it's not just Bud Light and Shock Top- they offer Alaska Amber. At $4.75 for 16 OZ, it's not a bad proposition. Three kids items on menu.  Burgers are tasty, but not out of this world, just ok.  The \"meh\": Who doesn't love some kick? Be careful though, if you ask for jalapenos, you are getting JALAPENOS. Fresh, unseeded, and LOTS and of them, completely overbearing any flavor of the burger.  Fries are very average, and the \"secret sauce\" is little more than thousand island.  Shakes are tasty, but the picture in no way matched the finished product- none of the presentation or flare in the menu pic- it looks like a small boring plastic cup filled with a less than generous helping of whatever flavor shake you went for. Don't know that it's worth $5. Overall- ok, got that one crossed off the list, no need to come back.",

When the bartender finally asked me if he could help me I told him I was here for a to go order he came back and said it's not ready and then went over to the bar to eat his food which was on the counter. Two minutes later without cleaning up the mess he bar he went into the back of the house and that's the last I saw him for the next 15 to 20 minutes before I left. The busser brought my food out and put it on the counter and then went back into the back of the house I went to grab my food and another employee came out and asked me what I was doing and I said where are all the employees this is my food and she said how do you know it's your food. Probably because I am the only one standing here waiting for the last half an hour.",

All the tables were nasty and nobody was cleaning. We waited 30 minutes for our food. It wasn't exceptionally busy and I wasn't expecting this wait for a counter type of burger joint. My burger was so overcooked it tasted like a rock. The inside of it was grey and weird textured. The fries were inedible. I don't say that in jest or to exaggerate, they were rock hard bleached colored sticks.   The entire time we were there 5 orders got sent back to the kitchen. The manager looked frazzled I didn't bother her with my issues for a $12 meal. I may try it again, I think they just had a really off night.",

We usually do not eat at Fremont, due to the fact that we have not had the best food experiences here in the past. However, we decided to give this place a chance since we were downtown already and, hey! Who can say no to a good burger?! The menu has about six burgers, but we got the Flippin good burger and a side of fries. First, let me just say that I am happy that there is a place that does not over salt their fries. These fries are pretty damn good... They are fresh, and have the right amount of salt. The burgers were fresh, and the Flippin sauce was a good touch. You can tell by the taste and quality that they do use fresh ingredients, which is a MAJOR plus in my book, because who likes a poorly made burger. I didn't have a chance to try the milkshakes or ice cream ( mostly due to the fact that I was stuffed from the burger and fries) however, I do plan to return here before the summer is over or during the life is beautiful festival. If you enjoy burgers as much as I do, then please take my word for it and try this place out. :)",

    "text": "This place was pretty good, especially for people who like plain food or picky eaters. We ordered a double cheeseburger, French fries, and chicken strips to share. The burger and fries were awesome- my partner enjoyed that he could pick the size of his burger, offering a small, medium or large and single or double party options. The fries were delicious, never frozen, seemed like the hand cut kind you make at home. The chicken strips were decent but tasted kind of like the oil they were fried in although they weren't greasy, just had an oily taste to them. They had a lot of options too, which I like, including vegetarian options like garden burgers and portobello burgers. They just seemed to have a lot of options all around, including turkey burgers, onion rings, chili cheese fries, a selection of draft beer, and an endless dessert menu of milkshakes and ice cream that we didn't really check out. There also were big screen tvs with the sports games on which is nice, and the restaurant was clean and on the cheaper side.",

The management is not interested in the fact that while we were there for 30 mins, we saw 6 people come in and walk out. He sat in a corner, saw it, but didn't try to find out why they left. Bad business for a new addition to Fremont.  I am a local and would love to see them succeed but they need to make changes soon.",

They are a newer establishment on Freemont & LVB with a modern farmhouse feel inside and everyone was very friendly. The menu was pretty straight forward and very reasonably priced.  (THANK YOU FOR NOT CHARGING $5+ FOR A KID'S GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH BY THE WAY!)  Our burgers were not greasy, the bun was so soft and almost brioche like.  I love their Flippin' sauce whatever it is and so did my 2 year old.  We tried the apple pie concrete and the custard was delicious and not too \"eggy\".  I don't know if it was a Halloween treat, but the nice lady who helped us behind the counter brought out a free small ice cream cone for the little one.  Will definitely be coming back when we are downtown!",

How in the flip do you charge your customers almost $1 for one damn onion ring?? I was flipped off when I saw the portion. I even asked the girl that served us about this flippin' small portion & she looked as though she was in full agreement with my dismay!! I wanted more flippin' onion rings but we made due.. I had 2 1/2 & my husband did too.. I was going to be salty and was going to only give 4 stars.. but decided to be flippin' nice & give 5 because the burger was delicious & was under $5 so I'm going to flippin' forgive them for them onion ring hustling their customers. I'll definitely be back!! Looking forward to trying some of their flippin' ice cream concoctions & that Farm Burger. Old McDonald himself probably couldn't make a better flippin' burger!",

The meat is quality and very tasty. It's a bit on the greasy side, but I like that. The double burger is the perfect meat to bun ratio. The fries are fairly bland but a little salt and a side or ranch can remedy that.    The concrete mixers and shakers are also really solid. They have a nice variety of ingredients that you can add for a customized creation or you can just pick a pre-made option.   The ambiance is clean and simple. They also have outdoor seating on Fremont st.",

The  loaded fries were the best thing I have put in my mouth in a long time.   I cant remember what they were called but get them.  Just do.

    "text": "My friend Keith and I went in on Friday evening and sat at the bar. We ordered a couple beers and asked for menus. I've never been to this restaurant/bar so I had a couple questions. Our bartender Dylan was in and out of the bar but answered all of my questions. He then left the bar for several minutes before returning. When he finally came back we placed our order for a couple of burgers. Our food took longer than I'd anticipated considering the establishment wasn't busy. Our food came out and once I cut my burger in half I realized it was undercooked. I apologized and asked Dylan if he could have it cooked a little bit longer for me, which he did. When it came back it was cooked correctly. The burger tasted as if it were a frozen patty, stale and not flavorful. It definitely wasn't fresh beef. We finished eating and I went to the ladies room to wash my hands. When I returned the check had been placed in front of our seats. I had planned on ordering another beer after returning from the facilities so I was surprised to see the check. I asked my friend if he'd asked for it and he told me he had not. I was slightly taken back by this, there were many open bar stools and the restaurant had many tables open so I didn't understand why this had occurred. I probably wouldn't of been this  offended except for the fact that the couple sitting next to us and had ordered after we had didn't have a check in front of them. We waited for a minimum of 15 minutes before placing a form of payment onto the check. Mind you, the couple next to us still didn't have a check dropped in front of them. In spite of the fact that the food wasn't good I'd said to my friend at least the bartender is good.....I literally ate my words. It's incredibly insulting to of been treated in such a passive aggressive manner. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone, friend or foe",

We walked in here expecting \"FLIPPIN' GOOD\" food... and we were sitting there constantly asking each other, \"Do you want some?\" -- and not out of love, but because we just didn't want to eat what we had ordered. We literally walked out saying in unison, \"Never again.\"   Located in the heart of downtown Las Vegas -- inbetween casino hopping & gambling on a Saturday night, we got a little hungry and were heading towards Park for some food. Saw this place across the street & decided to give it a try since it seemed pretty empty in comparison to the big crowd at Park. There is a reason for this obviously, but like I said, we were in a gambling mood...   And we lost by choosing this place. I don't know exactly what to say, except that it was bland, oily, and just... not flippin' good. I'll give it an extra star for the cleanliness of the venue & the fact there was no line I guess.",

Got seated right away, busy being St. Patrick's Day, but they still had tables open.  Our server was very nice and checked on us several times. The burgers tasted great along with the queso bacon fries. Small portion for the price. I'm willing to pay it, but thought it would be twice the size. However,  overall the prices are decent for a downtown Las Vegas eatery which is a bonus.  All of food was good, our server was friendly, the only drawback was the time to get our meal. I'll chalk it up to it being a drinking holiday and everybody ordered food at the same time. Next time I'm downtown and want a burger I'll be sure to go back here.",

There was a decent amount of seating to accommodate walk ins but no one to great you or seat you. We walked towards the bar and kinda floated about until I spotted some menus. I grabbed one and we took a seat at the bar and glanced over the options. We ordered one Nashville hot and one Vegas hot. A bartender showed up and I stared at him until he realized he had never seen us before and perhaps we needed to place and order or might like a beer... we placed our order ToGo which was also recommended by others. The food came out packaged well and smelled really good. We walked back to our place and got to work. The Vegas Hot is HOT! The Nashville was really tasty, you'll still break a small sweat but it's good! The fries were good too, lightly seasoned or maybe that was just salt! Either way... there is nothing healthy about this food. The presentation was well done and I could tell this was no fast food burger. It was layered well and surprisingly didn't fall apart while eating. The actual plant based party is smallish... but super well coated in the rub and adds for a lightly greasy but flavorful bites. As a vegan who eats cleaner than that most of the time... call this a cheat day??? I felt satisfied yet kinda gross haha. But that's junk food for ya! This place is worth a try if you're in the area and looking for bar food.",

I ordered a Dirty bird sandwich with the optional upgrade to the Fire fries for an additional surcharge, and my partner got the 3 chicken tender meal with fries at the Nashville heat level, which is on the lower end of the Flippin' Good spectrum. We were both sweating and struggling a little bit with our food's heat levels, and I'm a seasoned heat-head who's braved fire chicken noodles from Korea, habanero salsas from countless taquerias, and \"hell ramen\". My respects to their spice mixer! The food was delivered quickly, and was still warm. The cheese sauce on my fire fries had dribbled it's way to the bottom of the container, but they were still edible if not super-crispy. My partner loved his tenders and devoured them and the fries all within the hour or so of their delivery. It took me a bit longer to make my way through the dirty bird, but that wasn't because it was undesirable in any way- it was absolutely delicious! Super crispy batter on the outside with juicy chicken on the inside. Throw on an egg and bacon? Duhhhh-licious! I ate the remaining fire fries the next day after, and while I still have some coleslaw leftover it's not so say it wasn't great- their portions are just that generous!",

I ordered a white chocolate macadamia crunch (vanilla custard with fresh baked macadamia nut cookies and Ghirardelli white chocolate sauce). My milkshake was delicious. All of the ingredients blended great together. Milkshakes are made to order, so expect a wait. If you like macadamia nut cookies, definitely try FGBS cookie milkshake. I will be back to try other items on their menu. Flippin' Good Burgers & Shakes is a good choice for milkshakes.",

We drank a Guinness and a Coors light (hint: check in on Yelp and you'll be thankful you did) a lemonade, a dr pepper and sweat tea.  The honey sauce is a must try!  The music was a perfect loud and a good mix. The hostess was super friendly and helpful eventhough we were a spicy disaster of a group of six including a high chair.   The place is unique and you can even enjoy some television with your family or friends.   We'll absolutely be back for seconds.",

From the country-esque feel of the place, to the country rock music  playin' and to the plethora of beers on tap, this place just drips with the essence of a great time mixed with even better food! After we were shown to our booth, it wasn't long before trays of food were being delivered on silver \"platters.\" Mountains of gooey cheese fries (small extra charge) and a chicken sandwich that puts all other competitors to shame. I went Vegas hot, which is ghost pepper based and it was amazing. Just the right amount of heat. On the table is a pepper infused honey, that is also highly recommended and if they sold it, I'd buy a bottle right now. The sweet tea takes me back to my days in the south where I attended College. Finally, I had a milkshake that I got to pick the ingredients and it was heaven. Especially on this 107 degree day!!!!  I highly recommend you guys and we will be back!!!",

It wasn't too busy when we got there. We decided to order the vegan fried pickles but initially we were given the wrong dipping sauce. The server who brought out our sandwiches ended up getting us the vegan dipping sauce for our pickles. The pickles we're delicious and the sauce was kind of like a cool ranch type of sauce.  My son and I ordered the Vegan Chik'n Sandwich and my son's girlfriend ordered the impossible burger. I ordered the bacon queso fries with my sandwich.. like I said, I'm not vegan lol. Everything was good. Service was ok. For whatever reason it took forever for my son to get the beer he ordered but the waitress wasn't bad. The four stars is just because it took forever for that beer and because we got the wrong dipping sauce.",

Most of the time I just sit at their bar, the bartenders are very kind and down to earth, ready to serve and never got any attitude from all the times I have visited this place.   The food is really impeccable! Their fries are really good, and their vegan chicken sandwich is something to die for, I don't know how they do it and frankly, I don't care because it's delicious!   The price is moderate for this part of town, other than that, it's a great place to go.",

All of a sudden we were in the mood for burgers so we saw flippin good burgers and I did a quick yelp search, it had great reviews. Our server Saul was a charm. He was very attentive and was able to respond promptly to our questions regarding burger choices. We opted for the bacon cheeseburger with avocado and we also got the Nashville chicken sandwich with Nashville spice. The spice had a tolerable kick to it but it was good and it is spicy! The burger was finger lickin good. Honest opinion about the chili cheese fries ???  I've had better. Not a fan of beans in my chili. Must try if in the area?",

Loved the country music of course.  Bartender was professional, knowledgeable, friendly, and detailed. I mean. Perfect!  Ordered a Vegas level hot chicken which wasn't too shabby. It sneaks up on you but easy to eat for a spice lover. Note: softest chicken I've ever experienced. How do they do it?! So good.   The theme, service, cleanliness, and food quality makes me all happy inside. Thank you!!",

The only way I was even able to be sure I had been given the non-chicken, chicken sandwich was once a bunch of the deliciously flaky, crispy coating had fallen off, I could see the more rounded-corner square shape the vegan bean curd had been molded too. Otherwise, I literally could not tell the difference in taste, texture, or appearance that what I was eating was vegan.  My husband was even so impressed that he sent a photo of the sandwich and it's inside texture to his friends. More than one responded in the same accord, \"You better make sure that's vegan because there's just no way.\"  I also ordered my sandwich with onion rings. Those were equally as perfectly crispy and amazing. I ate almost everything on my plate, which is unusual for me. I highly recommend this place for the quality and care it puts into its food alone.",

The onion rings are outstanding, thinly sliced and lightly breaded and pipin hot . The flippin sauce that goes on the burger was tasteful but not in an over the top type way . The only thing I would change would be to serve the burger on a warm or hot bun, just my prefrence , and  not enough to knock this down from 5 star status - located in fremont east and certainly worth a visit .

My chicken sandwich was good but it did not compensate for the terrible service. No drink refills even when asked for. Our table stayed covered in everything we ate until we left. Our waitress charged us 1$  4 for toppings that she added to our milkshakes. When we ordered our shakes we pointed to the picture depicted on the menu of a shake with banana, chocolate, and peanut butter. Rather than explaining that the picture was a special order shake that would be an additional 4$ on top of the already inflated price of the shake. It seems to me this fee would be clarified on the front end by our waitress. This was not a busy restaurant scenario. There was ample staff in correlation to customers. We came during a slow time. Still we waited almost 30 min to get our two milkshakes which cost a whopping total of 18$. The elderly bar tender was beyond rude when I asked him to clarify the charges on our bill. I give this place only two thumbs down because that is all I have to give.",

    "text": "Holy crap, guys. I mean, Ho. Ly. Crap. So, I gave up red meat when I was a kid, on a whim. So I've been eating fish and poultry my whole life. You become a bit of a connoisseur of poultry after a while: it's easy to over-cook and many people slather it with sauce to \"mask\" the dry, tough, inedible mess they just made. This is DEFINITELY not the case with this restaurant. I work with a bunch of picky eaters and we tried this place cause it's close to work and Uber Eats delivers. We all ordered different chicken items from the menu, prepared different ways (fingers, spicy, grilled, crispy, etc) and everyone raved at how good their meals tasted. These things are HUGE and if I could have finished the whole thing in a sitting (which I can usually do, no problem) I would have because I just didn't want the chicken-induced happiness to stop. I'm not even done yet and I'm already writing this essay to make sure you don't pass up an opportunity to eat whatever heavenly thing you're considering on their menu. AND I'm already thinking about what I'm going to order for next time.  Look, do yourself a favor and order the Dirty Bird with avocado and a fried egg. Grab extra napkins. Wear stretchy pants. Do what you must and after you do, send me a message to thank me.  P.S. I would have included a picture but the aftermath wouldn't have been pretty and wouldn't do this restaurant any justice.",

    "text": "Soo disappointing.  Two stars, because they actually offer vegan options. Unfortunately, they are not that good.  First off, they advertise local/special beer, but for the flights, your choice is 4/5 of the 5 options that they offer...lol. Two of which were IPAs. No browns on the menu exc 10% ABV Imperial Stout & Guinness....k. I just expected more given the beer in the title. If they didn't advertise their beer, I wouldn't gaf. Just bad marketing there. Their cocktails seem more interesting, but we didn't get one, so I can't comment there.  The vegan onion rings were the best of what we had. The fries weren't bad.  But the vegan chxn burger.......ufff. It was just really seasoned & if you don't like the chosen seasoning, you are SOL. Idk if it was cumin or some rub or Frank's Red Hot or what, but I kinda couldn't escape it in a bite, 'cause it wasn't just the sauce, it was IN the breading on the chxn. The bun was like a school bun & soggy on top & hard on the bottom.  The waitress actually said, \"You don't like it?\", which was super awkward to me, haha.  I understand that it's located in a touristy area near Fremont St, but $56 for a burger meal & drinks for two peeps is steep, considering we aren't at the Wynn/Bellagio or something.  All in all, I appreciate catering to a veg crowd, esp. given the \"down home\" theme that this place has is usually very un-vegan friendly...but I just wish it was done better. I would hit this place up all the time if all of the boxes were checked.",

He then proceeded to ask me to leave because someone else was seated in the stool I had occupied for 10 minutes without him noticing. They definitely need to either better train their employees or get some that want to serve customers. Only reason they got a one star is because they have good food.",

Which is why when my mind was blown when I walked in here recently and it was completely different. The inside has been remodeled to have more group friendly seating. The menu has also streamlined to be burgers and chicken sandwiches. The food is definitely of a higher quality and you get to choose your heat with the chicken. I will say the Vegas and the Flippin can get pretty hot, so beware before you order.   My only two gripes with them is that sometimes the wait can get a bit long and you just have to roll with it because it's right in the middle of downtown so that's understandable. My other major issue is that you don't get fries, or any side when you order a burger or sandwich. If I'm paying $9 for a burger, I shouldn't really have to add $4 more for fries or onion rings.",

The food was about a 7/10, but we enjoyed going there every now and then for a casual and good work lunch. Then they re-modeled it and tried to turn it into a more formal, classy bar type of joint. Now it just feels stuffy inside and the food is no longer worth the higher prices they are charging. This is a tough review to write, as I want everything downtown to succeed, but I am disappointed in the direction in which they took Flippin' Good.",

The Flippin' sauce is similar to the In N Out animal style sauce but a little less sweet. Burger is juicy and everything seems to go together!   My favorite thing was the Flippin' fries though. Similar to animal fries, but better with cheese and jalapenos!! Amazing! Plus they serve beer at this place!   Drop by and you won't be disappointed! Cheers!",

It was delicious (wanted more pickles) this time 12/26 I went in and ordered my food. I even convinced my husband's cousin to eat with me (my husband missed out). I ordered chili cheese fries, Nashville Chicken sandwich. OMG...loved it soooooo much. My husband's cousin ordered the same thing. We loved the fact that the chicken was not greasy the flavor was on point. I am visiting Vegas for the holiday and staying at The D hotel ( I will review the hotel) I wanted to eat at a place where locals ate. SHARI was VERY NICE and MATT was very nice as well EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. I am leaving tomorrow to head back to CA I will be stopping by for a to-go sandwich.

You have the choice to get your sandwich plain or choose a level on the heat scale. Nashville level is a dry rub. It will leave a lasting impression and then you will be reminded about it again the next day. Plain is perfect and delicious. They also offer vegan fried pickles which come with the Nashville rub but I think I will ask for those plain the next time too! The bartender was thoughtful enough to bring me a cup of the vegan aoli to dip the pickles into while my friend enjoyed the ranch it typically comes with.  The place is not large but they have always been attentive. I know they also serve the impossible burger but I'm not sure if you have to order it special to make it vegan. They seem to be really knowledgeable about what is vegan and what is not, which is SO appreciated!",

We were really hungry and wanted to try their fried chicken sandwiches. One of us got a traditional fried chicken sandwich and the other one was the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. I also decided to get the dirty Girl Scout which was an alcohol-based ice cream drink that was absolutely delicious!   Now there were four different versions of a hat I could choose from for my Nashville chicken sandwich I went with the second level which I have to say was quite hard. Next time I think I would go with the lowest level. It was delicious and crispy came with lettuce, pickles, and onion. We each ordered fries with our sandwiches which were fantastic cut right from the potato and deep-fried.   Overall if you're down on Fremont Street and you're looking for some good chicken sandwiches and burgers I would definitely give this place a try. Super fun atmosphere! The staff is really friendly and nice! Overall it was a great time!",

On historic Fremont street, so super cute area.  You'll have to pay to park somewhere but DONT MISS THIS SPOT. Their food is great, vegan or nonvegan (they have actual chicken too... like dead animal chicken for those who like that). Scorpion pepper and ghost pepper dry rubs are options for the more daring members of your party. Buffalo sauce and flippin sauce top it off!! The fried pickles are a MUST!!! Half our group loved the onion rings and the other half thought they were too \"hard\" but vegan onion rings are hard to come by so I say go for it.   The vegan chicken will fool your friends -- it's that real, it's that good.",

We're typically able to luck out and get a table quickly, but I imagine on weekends that this place is packed. The inside has a college bar type feel & features a full bar. They carry a lot of local breweries on draft which is always nice & they have alcoholic milkshake options.   As for food I've tried two things so far, the impossible burger & the nashville hot chicken sandwich. The impossible burger was kinda meh for me. I personally like the flavor of beyond meat better, but still kudos to them for having the option. The nashville hot chicken sandwich is the real winner. The chicken is juicy & the breading is perfectly crispy. I personally don't think it's very hot so if you really want something spicy go for the vegas hot. The fries and onion rings are both tasty. I like to mix their chipolte honey sauce with ketchup for the perfect dipping sauce.   Give them a visit if you're in the downtown area for sure!",

Usually I avoid chicken at restaurants, but it was a juicy breast of chicken with fresh breading.  The bun was soft and the egg nice and runny.  Best chicken sandwich I've had in a restaurant! I also especially liked the sauce on the dirty bird and messy fries.   The staff was also super nice and friendly with great suggestions!",

The place was pretty empty when we entered, but a few couples entered after we were seated. The hostess that sat us was friendly and our waiter was great. Overall the service was outstanding.  I ordered the original burger and fries. My boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich with the Vegas level of spice. The burger was made to order and absolutely delicious. It definitely hit the spot. My boyfriend said his sandwich was very spicy, but good. He also ordered a beer.  The reason for docking a star is because the beer selection is minimal and the prices were a bit high for alcoholic drinks. A beer cost about the same as a meal!  Definitely recommend for the food!",

    "text": "So when I got a job working downtown I thought this would be a place I frequent ALOT let me just say I want to give one star but due to my prior five star experience I will give this place a two .. thing is I've ordered to go via yelp since starting work downtown on May 28.. never once had a problem or a wait ...  Enter in ordering from the yelp site I got a chicken sandwich paid the $2 for onion rings also placed a note asking for ranch and most definitely ordered before they opened told it would be ready at 11:15..  I arrived a bit early the hostess was acting all stressed still putting up umbrellas for outside but she was like oh I just put in your order and offered me water but it was a beautiful day so I hung out plus I walked around took pics of the restaurant fully expecting just to upload those but not change my review .. However the hostess who I pre tipped 20% and would've ended up giving cash just wasn't friendly cept in that fake way and she legit didn't try to align or relate to me I saw another lady helping folks outside who was nice but my sandwich was a hot mess and barely fried and soggy so I waited for what? Worst part I had no ranch and since I waited longer for my food than I recently waited sitting down to eat at Thai I had to come review that this place has gone down hill .. sad to say u won't be back but I hope sitting down service here gets you food like I had the first time but if you get to go be prepared for errors and missing items and not worth it food that got a tip they didn't earn",

We were \"Vegas'd Out\" (that is an actual term, right?) and killing our day before heading to the airport in the early evening. We lost some money at Binions and decided the hangovers had subsided enough to eat. And frankly, we were a tad ravenous by that point.  We started (bin 702) and ended (Flippin' Good) this Vegas trip with vastly different but comparably amazing eats. Flippin' Good was just what the doctor ordered on a hurting early Monday afternoon.  We shared a peanut butter banana milkshake to start, and while the presentation wasn't anything like the way it looked on the menu it was frigging delicious. We each ordered chicken burgers... Heather the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich and me The Dirty Bird. Heather opted for a side house salad and I went all in with Bacon Queso fries.     A comment about the heat levels here as reviews seem to differ. Heather and I LOVE hot food and can handle heat. Like, very hot. We both ordered our sandwiches as Vegas Hot spice level (with less than great stomachs we didn't want to risk the highest \"Flippin\" level when getting on a plane later...). I can tell you as a guy that loves heat that Vegas is planty enough heat. It is perfect in my opinion and will get you sweating a bit and the mouth salivating uncontrollably.    The burgers were huge, delicious, spicy and perfectly greasy. They were literally perfection for our damaged carcasses. The sides were average, but these burgers will have me back when I can enjoy an adult beverage with them (I couldn't think of booze that day). We raved about Flippin' Good Chicken when we arrived home and look forward to returning in our future Vegas adventures.",

I have had a couple of Chicken Sandwiches in my life that can compete with this one but despite that this sandwich was AWESOME!!!!! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that they could make it just a little bit spicy and it would really be the BOMB...however it is great just the way it is.  I had fries with mine while the wife had Onion Rings (2 buck upcharge for those...LOL) but she was so excited because most Vegan establishments don't have a vegan batter so she can't enjoy them. While this place is a BAR per se it has a great atmosphere and it definitely fits on Freemont Street. So if you're in Downtown Vegas also know as Freemont Street and your craving a great Vegan Chicken Sandwich...look no further than Flippin Good Chicken.  Eat, Drink, and be Merry, my Friends!!!!!",

I ordered the farm burger which comes with bacon, a fried egg, and fries. The fries are simple but tasty, they offer a variety of cheese, bacon,  carmelized onions, seasoned, and/or jalapeno options for fries. But kept it simple. The farm burger is like a ultimate breakfast sandwhich from jack in the box on crack. The flavors are fresh and they melt in your mouth like the ultimate breakfast sandwich. The Vegas hot chicken burger was awesome. Very spicy. The flavor of the sauce makes the burger one of a kind. Definitely coming back to this place!!!",

Pretty simple inside but clean which is nice after stepping in off of Fremont Street.  Everybody in here is super nice and friendly and even kept their cool when an extremely drunk woman almost lost it.  Quite entertaining!  Anyway, on to the food!  I wasn't feeling the spice that night so I opted for their crispy chicken sandwich because their sauce sounded very tasty.  It came perfectly fried, juicy, and had an amazing crispiness to it.  The sauce was great and if I had a colander of it, I would've drowned my sandwich in it.  The fries that came with it were unfortunately very limp and flavorless but I guess that means I'm going to have to try their coleslaw next time!  My buddy got their Nashville hot chicken sandwich which their second of four levels of spice.  I took a bite and although I am definitely a fan of the spice, even level two was a bit too much for me.    The next time you are downtown, get yourself in here and it will make you feel good.  It will put you in that warm spot after a night of drinking where all you want to do is go to bed and get cozy.",

Stopped in for lunch and was greeted by an awesome hostess and really friendly server who kept warning me about how hot the food was.  Ordered the Nashville hot sandwich on his recommendation as he didn't want me to get too burnt... wow... Glad I stopped at 'Nashville' instead of the higher 'Vegas' and 'Flippin' Levels of heat. It was the perfect level of spice without killing the flavor... delicious sandwich... crisp chicken and awesome flavors.  I don't even like chicken... but this was a good chicken sandwich.  Paired with the fire fries... those had some kick.  Flippin good as the name suggests.",

I went in right as they were opening, so the place was spotless, which is always nice. The menu is short, and to the point. Burgers, fries, shakes and onion rings. I got the double cheeseburger, regular size fries, and a soft drink. You have to order everything ala carte, no \" value\" meals here. After a brief wait, the food was brought to my table. The burger was decent sized, about the same size as a double burger from Jack In the Box or In N Out. The serving of fries was very generous, but slightly overcooked for my liking. The burger was good, but did not blow me away. And for $13.50, I wanted to be blown away. It was essentially Carl's Jr or Sonic quality at twice the price. So for me, it qualifies as a dissappoint.",

We munched on the fries while we waited.  He eventually had to go complain.    The fries look crispy but they aren't, and they taste weird... The onion rings other people ordered looked much better than the fries tasted.  By the time I got to my burger, it was cold due to the wait for my friend's meal.  The bun was much too big for the burger, I would suggest getting a double just so that it's proportional.  Bun also didn't seem super fresh.  The patty was small and bland.  The sauce tasted good.  The lettuce was a bit bitter.    Not the worst lunch I have ever had, and everyone has an off day, but I don't think I will go back.",

The place is new and in the area of Fremont St that is being redeveloped.  When I entered 1st thing I noticed was the place was super clean and nice inside.  A review of the menu board found all the typical burger joint offerings.  Although I did not try their shakes or frozen custard saw many people ordering these  and they looked really good so will try next time.  I settled on a Flippin Good Double Cheeseburger and an order of fries.  The burger was cooked fresh with a good bun.  What I really enjoyed is they offer grilled onions which is essential for a good burger!  However what separated them for me from the many other burger joints was their fries, as they were really tasty!  Crispy outside and soft inside, and not greasy.   In addition found the service good and the staff helpful with good knowledge of the menu.   Overall good food in a nice environment so will be back on my next trip to Vegas!",

We had the vegan chicken sandwich a while ago and thought they had vegan chicken tenders from an instagram post we obviously mis read. So we Ordered our vegan chicken tenders. And we said \"vegan\", i mean trust me if you're a vegan and trying to order chicken tenders you are going to address that. So we get our tenders trusting that they are vegan because the waitress was quick and chill and had no hesitation when we ordered, so we go about eating when our food arrives. My roommate was so impressed by the way the tenders broke and tasted like freakin chicken! So when the waitress comes To check up on us, wish i can remember her name, but a redhead chick. I ask what brand they use for these vegan tenders or if they make them bcos they look so real and i see a cloud of guilt slap her in the face and she goes on to say that they have a vegan chkn SANDWICH but not tenders. Okay, so you didn't hear me say vegan. Thats ok, i would forgive you if you showed some type of sympathy and tried to make things better but instead insisted you didnt hear me say vegan. seriously dude? i clearly said vegan! You weren't listening. You messed up. And as someone who has worked and has many friends in the serving industry, you should do anything it takes to make this horrid mistake better Bcos now we have to digest this dead animal bcos she didn't hear us say vegan. And it was \"our\" fault according to her. Didn't even offer us any comps or anything. I even had to swallow my pride and ask if my friend, who btw threw up in the bathroom after this whole ordeal, could get the actual vegan sandwich to take home comped. As soon as I'm asking i then felt bad bcos of her energy and her saying shed have to ask her manager then i said never mind, please fix your post on instagram and not let this happen again. I hate bad customer service. This could've easily been made better and wed come back for there vegan sandwich like we have many times.  But we will never ever step foot in this place again after this.",

I'm always excited when a new burger joint pops up, and I was especially excited to see another food option in Fremont East.  I spent this past weekend downtown for Life Is Beautiful, and I ended up at Flippin' Good.  Considering the amount of people in the downtown area, I wouldn't say that the place was slammed.  Defintiely busy but not at all crowded to a point of being overwhelmed.  The staff, however, was definitely acting like they were overwhelmed.  The service was slow.  Food came out after a very long time.  My onion rings were well done on the outside and raw on the inside.  My burger was average - I think this is as much of a comment as it warrants.   The only perk of my visit is that I got a free beer.  Just to be clear, the only reason I got a free beer is because the staff was overwhelmed and accidentally put the order in twice.  I'm willing to give this place another chance when it's not so crowded downtown.  I'm always willing to excuse external factors, so here's to hoping for another place to get my burger fix.",

They make me think of them as In-N-Outs little brother that wants to be cooler and hip by having more options, when in reality they should maybe just focus on 4-5 different burgers. They have a flippin' sauce that once again tries to resemble the INO one but doesn't come close.

The word \"concrete\" was a misnomer, however; the custard had the consistency of a shake. In fact, it was so liquidy that I had to drink it out of the cup.  Speaking of the cup, I had a very difficult time because my spoon did not fit through the hole in the lid! I discovered this after leaving and had to stop at a trash can to remove the lid because the custard was filled above the level of the cup. I had not been given a napkin, and the liquidy custard made a huge mess when I removed the lid so I could actually *drink* it. After paying almost $4 for an 8 oz custard, I was very disappointed. I'll be back hoping for a better experience, because the custard and fresh brownies tasted delicious!",

It has such a wide variety yet a simple menu (includes vegetarian options too!) the service is usually never bad, I've been here a handful of times and haven't gotten rude workers approach me. It's a very modern and up-beat scenery, which is perfect for the area of downtown-near all the bars and such. My recommendation would be the old fashioned burger to test the waters a bit, and to recognize the quality compared to most burger spots. The malt shakes are irresistible when in search for the sweet taste after a burger, and to mention the fries (which also have a wide variety). Honestly, a burger joint I'll always recommend to anyone who wants to try something different, that still won't hurt their pocket either.",

I won't lie to you and tell you I was excited to see it coming into view over the past few months - because truthfully I thought it was just a joke! I would have preferred to see a more local spot owned by people that might charge a bit more for a quality and unique product. Even for a burger joint, it can be done better. It's True that it's around the quality of a McDonald's .. On that I agree with other reviewers that have mentioned it.  It's new and clean and I hope they make a bunch of money, but I don't see a lot of reason to go there unless I'm truly out of options for food choices.   Anyway .. HAPPY EATING !",

My son ordered a kids burger and I had a double cheeseburger with fries with a brownie concrete for us to share.   The kid is a picky eater... The type of kid that takes a bite from a previously frozen patty/anything and spits it out claiming it tastes funny. With that being said... Nothing came out, WIN!! =) He obviously LOVED the concrete (ME TOO!!!)  My double was legit... The potato bread was delicious and they had just the perfect amount of everything on it! Not too small, not too big and it held together nicely!  The french fries... hmm... I just may not be into fried. HOWEVER, everyone around me was gobbling them up.   4 stars... I may have gone on a busy night due to an event downtown... To order was fast but the wait for the food was quite long for it being a quick eats joint. The staff seemed a bit frazzled, all very kind and apologetic due to the wait. Seems they were not prepared to have a big crowd on a Saturday night! Otherwise it was all great!",

I hit this spot after a long night of drinking and partying.. and then again when I woke up the next day! No it was not a dream it was a reality. there burgers are a complete and utter nirvana! This is a must stop when your in Vegas! Bit pricey... I paid 8 bucks for this burger so that's why it is 4 stars instead of 5. .",

    "text": "Wandered into this place looking for a quick bite to eat before heading into Don't Tell Mama's. What a great stumble.   Place is big. With any new restaurant or bar down on Fremont, I always try to remember what was there before. I'm always guessing a defunct check cashing place. It was very nice and clean and plenty of people working behind the counter.  Had trouble picking out what I wanted to eat as there are a variety of options. I decided on the farm burger (fried egg, grilled onion, bacon, American cheese). This is the way to go. Huge fan of eggs on my burger and the meat was juicy. All the ingredients complimented each other and the bun held up to the challenge. Other great thing was that, it didn't get too crazy mushy or anything (a common drawback to having ketchup and fried egg on a burger). I was actually taken aback on how good it was.  I wasn't expecting too much of a semi fast-food burger place on Fremont but this exceeded my expectations. As with all good things, you will wait a bit before your burger is ready, but it's definitely worth it.",

After they remodeled, it's changed to a traditional restaurant style with wait staff. The renovation will do the establishment well, but personally, I see no reason to go here any more than other plethora of sitdown restaurants in Downtown. The features that made Flippin' unique such as quick walk-up service and affordable lunch pricing did not make it post-renovation.",

The kitchen was spotless and the workers that was cooking turned out to be the Managers, something you don't see often. Fried chicken sandwich, A+. Double cheeseburger, A+. Onion rings, A+. The flippin' fries, omg A+. The only thing I have a problem with was the concrete milkshakes.  These things are C- flavor at best for outrageous prices. A 16oz is the only size they have and it costs $8. No thank you, I will not be doing that again. Flippin' good burger had me and just completely lost me with their terrible milkshakes. I do recommend going but I really don't recommend the shakes, it's a rip off. Love, Bug",

    "text": "The only reason why I am even writing this now is because instead of being productive yuppies going accent chair shopping after dinner on a weeknight, we made a comatose stroll through Burlington before coming home to nurse our food comas.   When we were invited out to try the new vegan chick'n sandwich at Flippin' Good Burgers, my first response was \"don't threaten me with a good time!\". Settled into the heart of downtown this small and casual burger joint is effortless enough to deal with the 2am drunks in need of a soaker, but pulled together enough to happily accommodate this accent-chair shopping, Hallmark ornament wait-listed wife and mother of cats. After we settled ourselves onto the dining bar that shelved an open window facing the Fremont, we placed our order and people watched.   Oh- the glory of these bad boys when they arrived. Now mind you, I'm a vegan of the kale-munching variety. I have hemp hearts, spirulina, apple cider vinegar AND chia seeds in my pantry. So I was a bit intimidated when this beastly tray slid in front of me, held together by nothing but prayers and a long toothpick. But, I'm no quitter, so I gathered my wits and tucked in.   And thank god it wasn't just a pretty face. Hot damn it was good.   20 minutes and several pointed questions later, nothing but crumbs remained on the tray, except maybe for a little of my dignity. I learned that:  -the onion rings aren't vegan, but Chef Chuck made us up our own vegan batch without the buttermilk.   - they fry the vegan chicken in the same fryer as the onion rings but NOT in the chicken fryer. We chatted about maybe then getting a fryer for vegan only or frying them in the French fry fryer. I feel like that's a bit nitpicky though. I personally don't have an issue with it.   - yes the mayo-like sauce on the chicken is vegan, as is the bun.   - ask about the BBQ sauces and DON'T eat the sauce on the table with the other condiments- it's a chipotle honey.",

I asked again is it hot hot, he said \"i mean not really that hot\". I asked again \"is it thai food hot\", he said yeah i guess that would be about right.   I got the vegas hot instead, since he said \"that one is normal hot\". It was not normal hot, I could of done it, but the sandwich was caked in half an inch of rub. There was just hot rub everywhere, to the point where I had to take the breading off of the chicken just to eat it.   Once the server came back at the end, he told us how he likes to purposely push people to order the flippin hot by telling them its not that hot just to see them sweat it out and burn their mouths from the heat.   So pretty much he admitted he wanted to get me and my girlfriend to get the hottest one to see us suffer.   Needless to say I probably wont comeback to eat here just based off of the service. The chicken itself was good once all the spices were gone. But having my server tell me he wanted to see me eat something unbearably spicy on purpose to see me suffer, that doesn't make me want to come back here. Instead of having a good meal that I enjoyed, I wasted money on a sandwich I could barely finish.",

    "text": "Flippin' Good Chicken is an appropriate name. I ordered the Dirty Bird (subbed the American cheese for the cheddar) and I will say the chicken is really amazing. It's juicy and tender. Really up to par with Chick Fil A tbh. Aaaaaannnnnddddd that's where the glowing portion of this review ends.   I arrived to the restaurant at approx 11:07pm yesterday (11/11) about an hour before they close. I was acknowledged and seated at exactly 11:15 behind the greeters counter. Not too shabby of a wait time. The girl at the counter was not exactly super kind, but it's also almost closing time. Then it really went down hill. I wait 20 minutes and no one in the restaurant acknowledges me again. During this time the couple that was sat right before me and the large party of about 7 sat about 5 minutes after me have been checked on by two separate servers. At this point I'm ready to leave, when my server finally comes by mildly apologetic for my long wait time. I ordered the Dirty bird with melted cheddar instead, a side of spicy Nashville fried pickles instead of the French fries, and an orange cream float. My food and drink were brought out pretty quickly, and my server told me my float would be comped for the long wait time. After that I didn't receive anymore service until it was time for my check. I did note that I was the only African American diner and the only lone diner at this time. Not saying that it for sure had anything to do with the service I received, but unfortunately these are things you notice when you are the only patron receiving poor service. But onto the food. The float was pretty good, nothing to knock your socks off. I really enjoyed the chicken. However, the fried pickles left me soooo disappointed. For one, I prefer a cornmeal breading on my fried pickles, and it seems they use the same flour batter on the chicken and the pickles. Also the pickles are sweet pickles, which was really off. The sweetness just didn't mesh well with the seasonings in the batter for me. And the flour batter didn't stick very well the pickles. I think the pickles may have been too wet going in. It was just the wrong flavors and consistency all over.  Overall, this place really disappointed me. Mainly due to poor service the entire time. I didn't even finish my meal there because I got so sick of people walking past me, but not checking in on me. The chicken really earned the stars I had to give.",

    "text": "Where the FLIP' is Ashton?   I totally felt like I was on a hidden camera show walking in to this \"not so cozy\" Western inspired restaurant bar last night. I've passed this place more times than some can count and perhaps I wasn't missing much or so I thought!  The VEGAN chik'n sandwich hands down is ah-flipping-mazing!! I'm not Vegan but I don't consume meat and this place totally satisfied my little cluck cluck craving!! This chik'n sandwich is HUGE; be prepared to use two hands! I'm unsure how they get the patty so darn crispy and golden brown but the chef deserves all the kudos! Definitely five star worthy if it wasn't for their lousy service.  No greeting at all! Sat at the bar in between shift change I assume. The lovely blonde finishing up didn't say crap; no menu nothing. Whatevs... Dylan her replacement was even worse. He literally looked like he just crawled out of bed. After placing my order I realized I didn't purchase any sauce and requested Dylan charge me for the additional sauces. He asked how many I needed and I confirmed one of each. Mr. Grouch, I mean Dylan kept asking if I was sure. I'm thinking to myself dude if I asked for one of each I'm sure that's what I need (not to mention I shared I've never been here). My favorite guy randomly wanted to negotiate sauce that I'm paying for reassuring me they cost extra. (Eye roll with frustration from a simple dragged out request). Dylan should apply at Dicks Last Resort because he clearly hates his job. Another bar patron asked how he was doing and he replied, \"I'm here!\"  Way to go Champ!   Order to go or lower your expectations. My food only took ten minutes and did I mention the food is delish?  VEGAN Chik'n Sandwich $9x2 Large Fries $5  Onion Rings $4.75 (small order but filling) Macadamia Crunch Concrete 10oz Dessert $4.75  Sauce .50  $38+",

FGB is a cross between McDonald's and Smashburger, but waaaay closer to the McD's side. It's fast food. It's no IN-N-Out, it's not even Carl's Jr worthy. Yes, it's cleaner than a McD's and the staff is definitely friendlier, but it's just not special.  I ordered a classic cheeseburger and a side of fries. The burger was bland, overcooked, served in a big ass bun (really, it's mostly buns, hun) and came with the lettuce, onion, and tomato (which were all fresh and still crisp). The fries were fries. Again, nothing to write home about.  The food is really two star worthy, but the clean, freshness, newness, reasonable prices, and friendliness of the staff allow me to tip the stars in the favor of FGB.",

It took me a minute to find it (look for the start of Fremont street by the heart attack grill, then cross the street and it's across from the Insert Coins Bar next to the griffin).  I just ordered a banana shake and onion ribs but they both were reasonably priced ($7.88 total), came out quick and were both really good!  The shake had pieces of banana that required extra slurp power but it was really good. The onion rings were crispy but not overly, and the flavor was on point. I like mine with ketchup but they were good without. Some of them had double onions inside the batter, which was good.  The inside was very white and comfy. There was a giant TV playing 90s alternative music videos but the decor and orange and white seemed retro chic and I liked it. It was clean inside and the servers were nice and even broke my $10! I'll come back & try a burger next time.",

Really good burger with a good amount of seasoning. The bacon had a little bit of a smoky taste to it and went well with the burger. The fries were good and not over or under cooked. Staff was helpful and friendly.  Worth another stop if in the area.",

The staff is friendly, smiling as you enter. The over look of the place is brightly lit which added to the animated vibe of smiling faces from the employees!  Even the aroma adds to the ambiance of the place, like an indoor cookout is going on.  Once near the order counter is the signage for all the juicy burger offerings, sides, and desserts!  I love how basic the menu looks - it echoes my other favorite burger go to place when I'm craving a burger - In And Out.  I order my double cheeseburger, paid, received my order number and my coworkers and I found a place to settle.  It didn't seem long when we heard our number called.  There were four of us and we all ordered different burgers.  Yum.  We all agreed across the board that this was a juicy and tasty adventure we had entered into!  The meat was cooked perfectly with just the right amount seasoning. Juices were gathering in the bottom of its pocket wrap.  I will definitely be letting others know to come try this place.  The cherry on top was the price. Not too bad for fresh cut fries, double patties burger with that flippin good sauce.  Go have a bite. It's a Flippin good time!  :)",

Skimped on the lettuce and tomato, if those matter to you. Sauce was  decent. I give the burger a solid 4.5. Onion rings, while not bad, were thin and only numbered six medium rings. $4.45 a little too much for the amount. 3 +/- on taste. 1.5 on generously. Since first visit, got the free small cup of PBR draft.  But since I'm leaving here still hungry, I'm giving it 3.0-3.5. Get the extra large burger if you want to be sure to be full.",

However, after a great recommendation from the gang at Banger Brewing, I stopped in to try a burger.   There was a vivacious bartender from upstate New York called Kayleigh (or something like that).  She was quite witty and engaged in light hearted banter about the 'Bills' and their historic failings in the Superbowl. I like IPA's, so she recommended one of the local brews on top, and it was delicious. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and was very happy with the quality of burger meat, Applewood bacon (yummy), and freshness of all the vegetables.  The chips (fries as you American's call them) were crispy and tasty. Definitely one of the best burgers I have had for a long time. Decent prices for food and drink. Don't make my mistake and let the ordinariness of this place dissuade you from trying this restaurant. I had a great time and will be back next week to try a different burger.",

The burger we had was the bacon which was also highly delicious. For the sides we had a salad and the chili cheese fries. All of which was worth the price (and you definitely upgrade to a double)...   For the drinks, I ordered a Jameson and sprite which tasted like well whisky and a splash of sprite. Got thru half my drink but the server didn't seem to pay attention that something was wrong. My fiance enjoyed his beers although $10 for a pint they weren't that great. The shakes however, skip the booze and go straight for a shake ! Definitely saved the drink experience.   Finally, the fire sauce is not hot at all. Was expecting something crazy and it tasted more like ranch with some cholula splashed in.",

The hostess didn't seem bothered by the crowd at all-very friendly and helpful. Our waitress took the time to ask about our costumes and complimented me, which is nice! They offer and promote local craft beer, which we appreciate both as locals and followers of craft breweries. I had wine in a can \"cause it's classy!\" according to the menu. As their name states, their chicken is Flippin good!!!! I had the lightly breaded and delicious chicken bites, with tangy BBQ sauce and the most amazing toasted bread. My husband had a chicken sandwich, and the patty was oversized-much larger than the bun, which doesn't usually happen. He is still raving about how great that was.",

The chicken was pretty bland, not much flavor. All I could taste was the heat from the spices and plain unseasoned chicken. We both ordered fries (does not come with your meal which is a little ridiculous considering the sandwiches are already overpriced) and they tasted old and soggy. There were also only two waiters, and one other table eating, the place was empty besides that. I had to ask four times for a water, and I also ordered a beer as soon as we got there which took 10 minutes to get as well, for a bottled beer. Not once were we asked for refills or how things were. I also wouldnt have stayed if I knew all they were gonna play was country music. Just me though, give it a shot but if you've been wanting to visit dont get your hopes too high.  @Christina, we ordered flippin fries but were charged 2$ extra for fries with a normal nashville",

This time I got the spicy chicken sandwich, me thinking how hot can it be? So I got the hottest of the hots in spiciness.  I was on fire!!! I'm not sure if anyone likes spicy food that feels like eating fire but that night I was attempting too lol. Every bite was so hot it felt like the chicken needed to cool down but no! It was the heat coming from it (I will never get the hottest again lol) We had fried pickles also, they use sweet/butter pickles so we weren't to into those but if you are into those pickles I definitely recommend.  A great bonus, when I checked in on Yelp, I was able to receive a free beer with my meal!!!!",

Anyways it's a small bar/restaurant with burgers and chicken sandwiches. Along with that they have shakes and malt type drinks. I was looking to get a malt and decided to try the apple pie cement. The picture looked a lot better than what actually came out because it was in a small sized plastic cup, not a regular sized glass with pretty presentation. But it did taste very good! I had gotten the farm burger which comes with bacon and egg. All sandwiches and burgers come with fries. The burger was good, again the presentation wasn't pretty but it was good. This is a good place to people watch as well because you're in Vegas and you know how people get on the streets.",

I think this places has pretty tasty stuff, better than canes chicken sandwich, I said what I said.",

We were from out of town and this place sucked. we had been to other places here in vegas, and this was the one bad experience i wish i had never walked into. shame on the food and customer service!!!",

However, when we got there we were seated and didn't see a waiter for about ten minutes.  No drinks, no water, nothing.  The bartender came over and apologized and took our order.  Then, another twenty minutes.  Still no drinks.  They brought out our food.  Still not even a water.   About halfway through the sandwich they finally brought some water and our shakes.  Seemed like we weren't the only ones either-there was a family of six that was standing by the front waiting on what looked like a to-go order of shakes that were there for most of the time we were.  I know places get into the weeds sometimes, so I hope it's better next time.    Also, I thought Nashville Hot Chicken sandwiches were dipped in sauce.  This one just had a bit of powder.  Still pretty good, but without the sauce it seems more like a glorified McChicken.  Shake and fries were good though.",

We were greeted by stares from waiters and guests alike. We figured we were just thinking to hard so we let it go. We were sat down at a booth and waited 15 minutes with no waiter in sight. BUT a Caucasian couple came in and were seated literally right next to us and had their drink order taken and served almost immediately? Upon getting up to leave, we told the hostess about the situation but she just scoffed and looked away with no comment at all. Is this really your best attempt at good service in 2018? Do better LOL",

One of my co-workers got the short end of the stick whereupon he received only one strip of chicken in his order of chicken bites (not sure how many you're supposed to get but the picture shows three) and which had a fishy taste as well and the wrong side of sauce.  The third co-worker had a chicken sandwich that he said was good. They say two out of three ain't bad, but that when the two ain't bad. Two thumbs down this time around.",

The fries were a take on In n Out's Animal Fries. Good portion with tons of cheese, flippin sauce and onions. The sauce has an extra sweetness I wasn't expecting. Makes me wonder what they add to make them spicy (listed as 30 cents more).   Overall a good place to stop for a burger if you are in the area and you can park without hassle or get it delivered cheaply.",

When we were finished the friends that joined us (with their kids) were starving so we asked a local where a good place was to eat that was decently priced (plus we didn't want to go too far onto Freemont after dark with the kiddos). He recommended this place and we were all so glad he did!! There were 7 of us in total and we all thoroughly enjoyed the food and experience! Everyone was extremely nice and welcoming. When they found out we had just came from our wedding the entire staff clapped and cheered which just added to the experience!  Other reviewers said it was too expensive, but my wife and I ate for $15 which to me is awesome! There was enough food for me to enjoy my burger and part of her flippin' fries and her to eat her loaded fries with extras still left. We were glad we didnt both order fries due to the portions. Vegas can be rather pricy. This is one of the cheaper places that we ate during our stay and the food was better than the $30/person buffet I paid for the next evening. Was wishing we had came back to grab more burgers after.",
