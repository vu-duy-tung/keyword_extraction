After we were asked no less than 5 times what we wanted to order (all girls behind counter are extremely busy chatting with one another and not listening to our order of 2 chicken pesto sandwiches), we were told they only had enough for one sandwich.  So we ordered 1 chicken pesto and one California turkey. Waited in their line to finally be able to pay where we were then  told they couldn't even make our 1 chicken pesto! Get it together! Ordering here is ALWAYS an ordeal. Ask for no sprouts and they'll still be on your sandwich. (A previous experience.) Unless you can \"break the code\" and actually get through to one of the talking girls behind the counter, you are ordering at your own risk! Good Luck! We left.",

It's filled with fresh mango and pineapple along with coconut, macadenia nut pieces and a wonderful pineapple vinagrette dressing.  The Wisconsin cheddar soup is so cheesy and smooth and the tortilla soup creamy with just enough zip and goes well with the tortilla strips.  Nice on a cold winter day!  For dessert the creme brulees are delicious, but I am hooked on the million dollar bar with butterscotch chips - it's soo good!   The servers are all so cheerful and friendly.",

    "text": "The Skinny: similar to Panera bread, this joint features overly sweet food and not that great bread (3) service: good, counter service, nothing special (3) value: it's okay, nothing special.  The hubs dragged me here to try out this joint.  We each ordered a combo - I ordered the Chinese chicken salad with tomato soup and the hubs ordered a half sammy with the cream of mushroom soup. Each combo comes with a huge hunk of generic tasting sourdough bread that is pretty unappetizing and stone cold. Oyster crackers are available for the soup.   My Chinese chicken salad tasted alright - it wasn't anything special. They were really light on the amount of protein served in this chicken salad. I tried the tomato soup which was really really sweet. I don't think I would order that again.  The hubs ordered the Asian BBQ pork sandwich which was again too sweet and overly sauced. The filling is minimal and the bread is really nothing special. I kind of don't like the bread - the weird overly doughy firm bread is not to my taste. Call me crazy but I think I prefer the yoga-mat chemical laced Subway bread better than the bread they use here. It really isn't all that.  I think the chocolate strawberry was the best thing that came with our meals.  The cool thing that they do have here is the different Italian syrups in their beverage station so you can customize your drink into something new. That is really cool.  Given the quality of their product, I'm not sure if I need a repeat experience. I really wanted to love it, but their food is too sweet and I'm not really a fan of their bread. If there was no where else to go and I was in the middle of nowhere, yeah, I'd give this place another shot. However being located next to all these other great little eateries, I think I'll pass on this joint. 3 starred review.",

Both paninis were fantastic, with a great mix of textures and flavors, blending crispy crust with chewy fillings, savory meat with sweet accents.  The Lobster Bisque I think suffers from too many chunks of \"stuff\" - carrots, tomatoes, celery, onion; it takes away from the lobster bisque as a whole, and I find the simplicity of the Roasted Red Pepper & Lobster Bisque to be superior.  The Chicken Enchilada Chili is very flavorful, but also very heavy. A bit too heavy, personally, but very hearty as a result.  Also, I don't know how I missed it before, but Cafe Zupas has a nice spice rack full of different hot sauces, right next to the condiments and beverages. That's always a nice thing to see.",

The best deal is the small salad an soup or sandwich combo. They throw in a slice of baguette and a chocolate covered strawberry!  The fountain drinks include an array of flavor syrups you can add and free refills.  Seating areas are spacious, attractive clean and comfortable. Staff are super friendly and keep the place humming efficiently.  Awesome spot!",

The location on Lake Mead is on my way home so I periodically stop here for dinner as well. Every single time that I come to this location after 7:00 PM, they are out of something. They do not offer an alternative to the items that are missing out of your salad, they just say sorry and send you down the line. The food here is not cheap spending nearly $10 on a large salad which I would say at best is a medium. I really praise the Rainbow location for their customer service and dedication to the regulars and I wish that I could say the same about this location. Every single time that I come here I swear they are out of something. It's either my bad luck or their poor strategic planning.",

It was busy but the line moved very quickly and was super fluid.   The combos seem to be where it's at. I ordered the Thai Mango Chicken Salad with the Tuscan White Bean soup. It was fulfilling and tasty! I couldn't have asked for a better meal. A little bonus, is that the meals come with a chocolate covered strawberry! Nice touch.   The ambiance felt very much like a cafeteria or even like a food court in a mall. Really busy, but wasn't too distracting.   I am not vegan, but have friends that are... I figured this would be a great place to take them because it's soups and salads... Unfortunately they don't have vegan options at this time!",

When I get home, I realize there's no dressing with the salad. I call them to let them know that I'm going to come back to pick it up. When I get back, a girl with dark braids and glasses goes \"are you here for the dressing?\"  and I say \"yeah for the spinach salad? Thank you\" and she hands it to me. That's it. No sorry, you're welcome, or sorry for the inconvenience. Literally silence. As if that's not upsetting enough, I come home again to realize that my fresh herb chicken is actually pesto chicken instead. I'd call back, but it doesn't seem like they care about messing up their customer's order. Will never be returning. Don't come here unless you want to waste your time running back and forth because they can't get a simple order right. Plenty of other sandwhich/salad places in town.",

You can do combos of the three, or just one. Every meal comes with bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. Anyplace that hands out chocolate covered strawberries has my vote.  They have a soda bar, where you can be your own barista and pump different flavors into your soda/tea/water/whatever. They also have a nice selection of hot sauce.   The veggie sandwich, panini style and toasted, is my favorite. I love their Wild Mushroom Bisque soup- so good! Their Berry Salad is also good, but not as good as the soup.  The Rocky Road Brownie is a bit heavy, but their layered chocolate cake is amazing and surprisingly light.  I love how they have one person for everything. It makes everything go so much faster  and each person can help personalize your plates.",

I liked the selection of sandwiches and soups offered but the food was mediocre. I had the lobster bisque and crab avocado melt. The lobster bisque was 'meh'... a thick flour roux base reminiscent of what you would expect from clam chowder at a street vendor in San Franscisco. Not a huge lobster flavor and not refined by any means.    The crab avacado melt had the potential to be very good, I mean crab and avacado how can you go wrong, but the bacon overpowered the delicate flavor of the crab. I love bacon, but this was not the time nor the place for bacon to bully it's way in. Other than that the sandwich was good for the price.   This place was packed with the lunch crowd, there was a line out the door. The restaurant had a very cafeteria like feel to it, and it was very loud, again the acoustics left something to be desired.",

    "text": "Disappointed. Walked in and was busy, looked like it had a lot of promise. Ordering was fast and easy. Food prepared quickly and packed up to go for me.   I got a Pesto Chicken Panini. Was good, didn't like the sprouts on it though as they kind of just lumped together in the middle of my sandwich. Couldn't really bite through them and just ended up pulling them off. Overall the sandwich was good, nothing amazing wouldn't go back for it. I also had some clam chowder. Salty and thin. When I think of clam chowder I think thick, creamy and nice pieces of clams. Barely any clams could be found and flavor was overly salty. Do not recommend it at all.  Very disappointing. Meal came with a piece of bread and chocolate strawberry. Only the front half of the strawberry was actually covered in chocolate but I mean of course it was good. Decided to also try chocolate cake because it looks good. It looks good but wasn't good. The cake parts were ok but the \"mousse\" was hard. Didn't taste good at all, was kind of crumbly when I tried to get a bite on my fork. Overall will not return for another try. Disappointed that 2 out of the 3 components of my meal were not good. Similar to Panera Bread except Panera Bread is actually good. So I'll be going there instead.",

    "text": "First time here and will be the last time.  When you get to the line to order several employees are yelling at you for your order. I had the sandwich and soup combo. Sandwich was the Italian. Sandwich was bkand and have never had muenster chhese on an Italian coldcut sandwich in my life. The soup was clam chowder. The clam chowder wad extremely spicy to the point I couldn't eat it. The kid serving the soup asked if I wanted croutons, they out 3 to 4 croutons and when I got ti the register tried to charge me .69 for them. When I questioned the cashier about a charge for them his comment was \"dude read the sign\". I refused to pay for them they did replace the chowder.  Another member of our party had the tomato basil.  The soup was watery and also very spicy. The 3rd person had a salad. For a large salad it was nothing more than a side side salad. When they asked for more dressing they were told there be charge for it. The total was $31.00 for food I wouldn't pay half that. When we asked to speak to a manager it took her almost 20 minutes to come over.  After much discussion anfmd raised voices we were refunded for the meaks,as we didn't eat much. I would not recommend this place. The employees are just kids and all are rude. Will never go back.",

Make sure you read all the ingredients though, my wife ordered her bbq chicken salad and it comes with olives which she hates. Seems like every salad there has black olives.  We went with the \"try two\" deal. You get to choose two out of the sandwic, salad, or soup. Went with the mushroom soup and it was tasty. Salad was the chopped chicken and it was ok. Next time will go with sandwich and soup as all the sandwiches looked and sounded good.   Good price for a nice selection. Something different from your normal fast food chain type food.

I order the same thing every time, nothing special or custom just standard menu items.  First time they forgot to make the salad altogether.  Second time they made the salad with no chicken or dressing.  Sent it back and it came back with chicken and still no dressing. Both times my order made it though the whole process, being asked multiple times what I ordered and still coming out wrong.  How is this possible given that the same salad was likely made hundreds of times each day?  Zupas please hire people that pay attention and take pride in what they do.",

All look really delicious and somewhat on the healthier side. If you wanted you can choose to get a full sandwich w/ soup, sandwich w/ salad, or salad w/ soup for about $8. Which is a pretty darn good deal.  I opted for the crab avocado panini with roasted red pepper lobster bisque. I love lobster & I love crab so I was one happy little girl! The meal was the perfect portion. The lobster bisque was delicious and I couldn't get enough of it. They even throw in a complementary chocolate covered strawberry! I mean, who does that!?

They have sandwiches, salads, soups, and desserts a la carte or you can opt for a combo which includes 2 of the following: whole sandwich, half soup, or half salad. I typically opt for a combo with a sandwich and salad, but it's always hard for me to decide because there's quite a laundry list of options. I've tried getting something different each time and so far my favorite salad is the BBQ chicken and all the sandwiches I've had are so good I wouldn't be able to choose a favorite...the turkey bacon avocado or ham bacon club are pretty tasty though.  No matter what you order every meal includes a chocolate dipped strawberry and slice of french bread on the side. They also have desserts including the chocolate dipped strawberries for sale a la carte. Service here is wonderful and we are always greeted before getting into line. The greeter will usually offer you a paper menu but you could always just look up at the menu board if you're close enough in line. Even when it gets packed here there seems to be plenty of seating. I will definitely be back again and again in the future..seems to be a favorite spot at the office and there is always a group coming here it seems like!",

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM...you get the picture.  Great speedy FRIENDLY service. Perfect place to grab a quick fresh bite to eat.    Everything on the menu looked amazing...13 types of sandwiches, healthy berry and chicken types of salads, and ten soups to choose from:  CLAM CHOWDER LOBSTER BISQUE WISCONSIN CAULIFLOWER GUMBO TOMATO BASIL  CHICKEN TORTILLA CHICKEN ENCHILADA SOUP TUSCAN WHITE BEAN WILD MUSHROOM BISQUE ROASTED RED PEPPER AND LOBSTER  I know, I know, I said the same thing...\"which one should I get, they all sound so good\"! Start with one and come back the next day...and the next day...and the next day...  A friendly greeter meets you at the door and since this was our first time eating here it was helpful to have some guidance.  She made some recommendations based on \"popular\" selections but we went our way.  My only complaint was that the dining room was freezing! It was warmer outside and it was 59 degrees that day! Turn the heat up during these chilly days please!  Honestly I'm not a fast-food soup person...I'm a total Soup-Snob. I've been to Sweet Tomatoes (bland) I've been to Panera (not impressed). I like my soup tasty hot and full of flavor. I prefer to have it at my favorite white linen tablecloth restaurant cafe or bistro. But, I have to say... I was pleasantly surprised with our order.  Trying to choose a combination lunch here was like trying to choose between chocolate covered strawberry's or creme brulee...hmmm tough decision.  Oh, and by the way, both are served here for dessert.  And the strawberries come with the combo meal.  Yipee!  I told you this place was awesome.  We had a lunch combo which lets you order soup or sandwich or soup and salad.  I had the roasted red pepper lobster bisque with the mango berry salad- and the hubby ordered the cream of mushroom with fried onions and a avocado turkey bacon panini...oh my goodness, can you say a contender for my last meal on earth? Soup was hot spicy and fabulous.  Sandwich was warm, crispy and tasty. We shared every bite and I suggest you bring a few friends and do the same.   This is the only Cafe Zuppas in town and the other is in Henderson.    Well, what are you waiting for?  Go Now!",

The two girls at the register were talking about their personal lives loud enough for everyone in line to hear, which seemed unprofessional.   The big issue I had was with the food. I got an Asian salad & a lobster soup. The salad barely had any meat & the soup tasted a little off. Hours later I started feeling sick & then the next morning I spent a good 24 hours puking & having other bodily fluid issues. I will not be suggesting this business to others & would advise anyone that is going to try it out for themselves to not get any of the soups with lobster, unless you want to leave with food poisoning.",

I got kidnapped and got taken here and I'm glad I gave this place a try finally since my cousin has been raving about this place.  I could compare this experience with when I first discovered Forever 21 during my Ralph Lauren Big Pony and True Religion phase. Wait wait wati! You mean something good doesn't have to be expensive?!  We were walking in and we were greeted by Rae with her friendly smile. She asked us if it was our first time and she told us about the food and the ordering process which was very helpful. She said their best-sellers for soup are tomato basil, lobster bisque and chicken enchilada chili. Everyone at the counter taking our order, making our food and working the register were wonderful and friendly.   Asian BBQ Pork Sandwich: Roasted Pork with cucumbers, carrots, cilantro, chili-lime spread and Korean BBQ sauce. I honestly wanted to try this but was expecting to get disappointed. Well, I'm disappointed about not being disappointed! The pork and the sweet BBQ sauce reminds me of the sweet filling of a Chinese BBQ pork bun. The cucumber, carrots, cilantro and chili-lime spread gave this sandwich a Vietnamese hint. 5/5  Crab Avocado Melt: Crab salad, bacon, avocado, red onions, tomatoes, celery and muenster cheese. It sounds like there's too much going on with the crab, avocado and bacon and I hate celery but it's actually pretty good. 5/5  Losbter Bisque: We had to fight over who's going to order this. But we decided on sharing. This is not the best lobster bisque I've ever had but considering the price of the meal and where I'm getting it from, it's absolutely good. 5/5  Wild Mushroom Bisque: Crimini, button and shiitake mushrooms. I LOVE mushrooms and mushroom soup is one of my favorite comfort foods. Great flavor, texture and consistency. Not too watery and not too thick...just right. 5/5  Chocolate-Dipped Strawberry: The strawberry I got was tart...and I seriously love tart fruits. Must be my lucky  day! This was free and anything good tastes even better when free. 5/5  Salted Caramel Creme Brulee: As the name implies: creme brulee with salted caramel (on top). The caramel is extremely sweet and thick. We tried finishing this but just couldn't. 2/5  Chocolate Hazelnut Creme Brulee: Don't expect this to taste like Nutella. This creamy dessert tastes like chocolate with a very mild hint of hazelnut and has candied hazelnut bits on top. It's only $3 though. 3/5  I may have found my perfect spot for quick lunches.  $5 for a sandwich or half a salad, $3-10 for dessert, $8 for a combo (includes your choice of half a soup/ half a salad/ sandwich). You get a free chocolate-dipped strawberry if you order a salad/ sandwich. It's way better than fast-food burgers and whatever which I don't eat. Their desserts may not be the best but they're doing me a favor so I don't get fat!",

    "text": "I had been to a Zupas in Henderson prior to my experience here yesterday, and I can't believe I didn't know about the combo deal!   Between the two of us, we shared an Asian citrus salad (minus the chicken), an crab avocado melt (minus the bacon), lobster bisque soup & a vegetarian sandwich.   Out of these 4 items, the lobster bisque was definitely my favorite. It was creamy yet subtle, it didn't over power the meal. I personally preferred the taste of the crab avocado melt over the vegetarian but my BF loves the vegetarian. The Asian citrus salad was one of the better salads I've had recently. It was one of the first to be finished.   The place was very customer friendly, with a very nice lady even helping us out with customer favorites. They have a spice rack for us \"spice is life\" crazies. BEWARE of Dave's radioactive hot sauce...I was impatient and didn't read the radioactive portion    Additionally, this location also has Italian soda shots to flavor your fountain drinks which is a PLUS PLUS PLUS. My lemonade tasted TOO DAMN GOOD after I added two shots of peach & one shot of raspberry.",

There was someone at the front door to great you and let you know if their recommendations. I definitely will be coming back.

    "text": "We worked up a hunger at the gym and up the street, there just happened to be a Grand Opening for Cafe Zupas so we figured, why not?  There was a line out the door for one reason-50% off your bill....WHAT!?!?!? Luckily the line moved swiftly and I was already in attack mode! Their system is quick, easy, and painless:  1) Order your salads and sandwiches 2) Order your soups(toppings are additional charge) 3)Order desserts and drinks....pay for your order  After you pay for your order, a worker is waiting at the end of the line offering to take your tray to your table for you!?!? Oh, and each order comes with a chocolate covered strawberry, so if you choose not to get a dessert, you still end your meal with something sweet....:)  Here's what we got: Nuts About Berries Salad Berry Mango Salad BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich Crab and Avocado Panini Cauliflower Soup Lobster Bisque Rocky Road Brownie Salted Caramel Creme Brulee  Everything was tasty, and the price for all this???? Just over $13 dollars! Great for the kids too, and Zupas won't break the bank either. Another unheard of thing is that they DO NOT accept tips AND they will clean up after you too! Hey, they may be on to something positive???? Welcome to the 702 Cafe Zupas! Now if only the folks at Chik-Fil-A follow your lead(CZ is out of Utah) that could be another win-win situation!   ALOHA!!!",

It is really close to the corner of Buffalo/Lake Mead and there is lots of shopping in that area. This will be a great lunch spot if you're in that area.  When you walk in, you grab a menu, and once you decide (they will give you samples if you need help) you jump in line and order. Think upscale cafeteria! There are lots of soups, salads, and sandwiches to choose from. I was surprised at the of the menu because I was expecting it to be a very plain Jane menu. It wasn't! We ordered a BBQ pulled pork, a turkey cranberry, and chicken enchilada chili. All were delicious.   I really wanted dessert, but I resisted. They had amazing looking brownies and creme brulees! Every order comes with a chocolate covered strawberry!!  After you pay, you take your tray and seat yourself. They have an area with different syrups that you can add into your soda or ice tea, but I didn't try them. I thought it was a nice touch, though and it is free.  I will definitely be back.",

With that being said, i was soooooo disappointed. One of the girls was very rude and i had to explain to each one (more than once) what i had ordered, the girl that was rude to begin with kept questioning what I ordered, as if i was making it up or something, \"are you suuure you ordered that and not this?\" once I had explained to her that \"yes, it was what I ordered\". I had to explain AGAIN what I ordered to the other girl.  I was irritated after that.   Would I go there again? Maybe at a different time of the day with different workers and see how it goes. Its a shame because the food was terrific, but again the service was ridiculous.",

    "text": "Fast food Panera.  We were lured here with the mailers and promise of 50% off the entire check.  We had the crab soup, clam chowder, and tomato soup.  All were spot-on with flavors and not overly salty or watered down.  The Asian pork sandwich was a winner.  It had a hint of heat and the cilantro really brightened up the sandwich.  The Thai sandwich and the crab avocado were adequate and not terribly special.    We loved the idea of flavoring your own drinks with the syrups they had at the drink station but noticed you need a lot of squirts to really flavor the tea.  I like the option, though.  The ice-makers were having a hard time keeping up with the crowd, which, I assume, were just kinks from opening days of service.  The staff was efficient and the management must be given kudos for moving the crowd along fairly quickly.  I don't suppose they will keep that many staff on hand in the coming weeks and months, so I will be curious to see if they can keep up with busy service.  I like that they have placards on the tables imploring customers to not save a seat as the tables turn over quickly.  Once you're done getting your food, it makes it easier to find a table fast.  This place was slightly cheaper than Panera but without the comfort of one.  Still, I've been a little annoyed with paying Panera prices lately, so this is quite a decent alternative.  The food is comparable, and I will come back again soon.",

Panera has an entire bakery and cafe, but Zupas does not even have hot tea. Also, the side bread at Panera is fresh made and Zupas tasted store bought. I was not as impressed with Zupas as I expected, but the food was not bad either. Compared to Panera, I would say Panera is worth paying a bit more for. The staff at Zupas is very warm and friendly!",

The place is clean, fast, efficient, and modern.  I walked in and out feeling very impressed by how everything looked and was run.  Service was super nice and felt really welcoming.  I had some red pepper/lobster soup, and a crab/avocado (real crab, not \"krab\") sandwich.  Everything tasted really fresh, and for the \"half and half\" combo, the serving made for a very pleasant meal.  They even offer soup samples to get a few for their excellent choices. Everything tasted fresh.  Even the berry salad that the Missus got was really tasty.  There are also a few nice bonuses such as Italian soda syrup for your beverages, and a chocolate covered strawberry as an added part of the meal.  My only advice to this little place is simply: Don't change anything: The service, the quality, and food left me with a happy stomach on the way out, and I will gladly frequent here.  Even the price hovers around $10 a person, so I was happy.  I will have to try the other options on the menu, but for a first time out, this was a great experience.   Definitely recommended.",

The panini grilled ciabatta bread was the best part.  I can't wait to try more of their soups. Their salad ingredients are vast and look very fresh so i'm sure the salads will be yummy as well.

The people are friendly and the service is A+. THIS location however should be secret shopped.   I ordered my usual a large create your own with mangos, strawberries, blueberries and a double serving of cinnamon almonds. I wasn't watching the guy make my salad but it looked a little light on the lettuce. The lettuce usually fills the 3 compartments of the to-go box. While I was asking for an extra mango dressing,  I couldn't get over the lack of lettuce, so I finally said that it looked a little light and could I please have more. 2 girls looked at each other then told him that I wanted more lettuce. He said that, THAT was the serving as he continued to wipe up around the lettuce container, but made no movement to add more. It gave me the feeling that he personally harvested that lettuce and he didn't want to part with it. Finally 1 of the girls put about 6 extra pieces of the shredded lettuce in my box.  I was so upset about the ridiculousness of it all, I didn't realize my 2nd dressing wasn't in there. While I was getting napkins, 1 of the girls from the line brought me a large dressing cup barely half filled. She told me they had ran out of the mango dressing, but \"here's what's left\". So you mean to tell me that at 1:30 in the afternoon they have COMPLETELY run out of dressing? After the lettuce fiasco, I feel that it's more likely that they wanted to be stingy with their dressing as well.  I'm glad that this isn't the 1st Cafe Zupas that I've visited.

I had my daughter in her stroller and the ordering line and placement of the table in the dining area were not wide enough to make it through easily. The food was just okay. I appreciate the effort and understand it is a newer location.",

    "text": "I had high expectations for this place because of the review my cousin left for it, the fact that my aunt (who prefers homemade stick to your bones and thighs soul food to any other kind) loves this place, and my mom kept ranting and raving. And they delivered!  While large franchises are nice because of convenience in numerous locations, I truly appreciate the unique quality of smaller ones. Per the website, this restaurant operates in Arizona, Idaho, Minnesota, Nevada, and Utah. The \"coming soon\" locations do not detail any in California so I guess I just have to eat at this establishment when I go visit the family in Vegas...  Any place that lets me try ALL possible samples and doesn't make me feel like I am holding up the line or need to hurry is automatically ranked high in my book! The service I've received during each of my visits to this (or any) Cafe Zuppa's has been on point. I like that the bar has everything laid out for me to see so I can create extra special custom sammiches.  The vegetarian soup is really good! It was salty. Sista likes salt.  They give you a chocolate dipped strawberry with your order. That's okay, I guess. Many would call that a nice touch, but I'm not the biggest fan of chocolate strawberries so I would rather them not charge a fee for adding ANYthing, like onions. Like almost a dollar! Keep the strawberry and give me breath-stank! If I remember correctly, they charge almost a one dollar to add a very small amount of \"extra\" to any soup or sandwich. I'm not trying to put anyone out of business, but a dollar for onions? I add and pay for enough of all kinds of other stuff to pay four quarters for that, in my opinion.  BUT the food is yummy, is fresh, and there is no place like this near home I have found in Cali. So four stars, it is...  2017 Challenge - 11 / 100",

    "text": "First time for this place, which I've been meaning to try for quite a while now.  During the week they close too early for us (9:00 p.m.), and on weekends I usually like a place with sit-down service and a bar.  But we were nearby when we started thinking about a quick dinner, and it was earlier than we usually eat.  I chose a combo, the turkey spinach artichoke panini, with a cherry balsamic half-salad, but I had them substitute cranberries for the dried cherries.  My +1 got a turkey avocado bacon, along with a large Yucatan chicken tortilla soup.  We took the tray to the back room, but the many available booths all had dirty tables, so we sat at a regular table.    My husband's soup bowl was only half-full.  Oh, it had a lot of stuff in it, and way too many tortilla strips, but jeez, how much does the broth cost?  I suggested he go back and ask for more broth.  To their credit they didn't add to the bowl, but gave him an additional bowl that had almost as much as the first one, so I got to have some, too.  It had a lot of chicken, along with corn, onions, tomatoes, and a dollop of guacamole.  It could have used more spice and fewer tortilla strips, but was very tasty and a whole lot lighter than their cream soups.  We decided to share the sandwiches, and they were both very good, but I liked mine better.  Duh, that's why I ordered it, so what was I thinking??  By the time I finished the soup and my half-sandwich I was full, so I took the salad home, knowing that I'd be hungry later from having eaten too early and staying up too late.  The half-salad was enough to share between the two of us for a snack.  Fresh salad, grapes, goat cheese, and nuts - yum!  The balsamic dressing was very thick and too sweet, so I'd get a different dressing next time.  The chocolate-covered strawberry and the baguette slice are a nice additional touch, and both have been saved for future noshing.  Another nice touch is the availability of Italian soda flavorings for adding to fountain drinks.  We didn't partake, because all I ever drink is coffee and booze ;)  We never get soda at places like this.  I'll definitely return to Zupa's.  It's great for fresh food at decent prices, with quick service.",

She assured me that they use a bowl and the eye ball technique and it reiterated that the portion was correct. While the other salad, looked proportionally ideal for a large order. Interesting...  The avocado crab melt was tasty, but the size looked liked a childs serving, I hope not. If I can give you a suggestion, use a bowl and scale for accurate serving and that will help you to control inventory and manage margins too.  All in all, it was a weird first time experience...",

They give you a chocolate-dipped strawberry and an insanely fresh roll too, with each order.  The beverage bar (self serve) has some amazing offerings.  My fave is the honey lemonade.   The food is always fresh and bursting with flavor.  My only complaint is at checkout when it's time to pay.  I am not amused with the cashier's pop-quiz every time I have to pay.  I barely remember what I ordered - let alone my family's choices - so it's an awkward moment while I have to walk over and study the menu board (up on the wall) and help the cashier figure out our order.  They really need to smooth-out this process.  Other than that, a delightful meal.  Think of it as upscale healthy fast food, with reasonably priced selections.",

    "text": "This place is awesome. I'd say sort of a mix between Panera and Subway (price point somewhere in between). They make everything in front of you so it's easy to make changes to what you'd like. I've tried a few of their salads (all very good) and have had the chicken enchilada soup which I love! Bread and a chocolate covered strawberry comes with any salad so it's really a decent amount of food. They have a combo option (half salad, half soup, half sandwich choices). Desserts are good too. Definitely a new favorite in my area.",

    "text": "If your looking for a delicious, reasonably healthy and inexpensive lunch then this is the place! They keep the menu pretty simple but with lots of options. You can have Soup, Sandwich, Salad or a combination of any. The selection comes in that there are probably a dozen versions of each. I'm generally a person who always orders the same thing anywhere I go. I like to stick with what I know I'll enjoy when I go out. Here at Zupas that's not the case, there's always 4 or 5 different things I want to try, so I'm usually trying something new or a new combination of something I like. Plus every meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry which is a nice little treat. Unless you feel you can afford the calories (I usually can't) then there's about the best selection of gourmet style deserts you'll ever find in a sandwich shop!",

    "text": "Betrayed my beloved Panera for a visit to Zupas the other day.   It was tough to do because I enjoy the combos of soups, sandwiches, and salads so much at Panera that it was hard for me to picture anything being better.   Well that and the fact that if I greeted her with another cafe's breadcrumbs on my face and my odor being that of Wisconsin Cauliflower soup, well she might not ever take me back.  The decor and ambiance were pretty lacking here in my opinion, and it didn't scream warm and inviting in the least, but rather cold and factory like.  A helpful employee instructed myself and a coworker on the ordering process and we went down the assembly line making our choices.   I found it a little chaotic as a first-timer but I'm sure it would improve with each visit and especially once you find that sweet spot of your favorite order.  An example of the chaos was that by the time we reached the cashier, my friend was in front and only half his order was on his tray, while mine was behind his fully completed.  The staff did a great job in getting it all straightened out and perhaps there wasnt an issue to begin with, but I prefer a seamless ordering experience and felt this one was slightly rushed and not as anal as I might like.   Patient, warm and anal is perfection for me in a cafe.   Get your mind out the gutter.     For food I went with the Tuscan White Bean and Veggie soup and the Thai Peanut Chicken sandwich.  I wasnt into the soup at all.   It just seemed flat and lifeless, though I should have probably realized that from the description on the website:  \"A light, vegetarian soup loaded with lots of vegetables & delicious white beans.\"   Why did I even order this is a question I cannot answer at the moment.  It also wasn't as hot as I like my soup to be.   Would not recommend that.   The sandwich was good.  It had a nice balance of sweet and tangy from the Peanut and Chili sauces, and the chicken tasted fresh and had a nice flavor.  The crunch from the cucumbers and pickled carrots was also welcome and slowly helped me forget how bad the soup was.  Overall it was a decent experience and meal, especially considering the price $7.99 for the sandwich and a half soup/salad.   It's not enough to have me leave Panera permanently, which shouldn't come as a surprise, and after some thorough mouthwashing she was none  the wiser to my momentary indiscretion.",

    "text": "The food is just ok. Soup is ridiculously overpriced and not that great at $6 for a bowl.  They offer syrups with the soda machine, but good luck making an italian soda because they won't give you half and half. I want to be clear, it's not that they don't have half and half, they do (I saw 6 gallons in the kitchen just from where I was standing in line) and they will not give it to you at any price. If they are unwilling to provide something so simple as a mere ounce of half and half when they have plenty, you can only imagine what else they won't do. I offered to pay for it and they still said I can't have any. They had the gall to suggest I should bring my own. Cause I've always wanted to be carrying around all the condiments I might need for the day. I've been trying to talk to somebody about this, but their management is impossible to reach.  I just can't believe a company would spend so much money on marketing and then be completely unwilling to address a customer's concerns.   So go ahead and try cafe zupas, and if you like it exactly how they serve it, good for you. Good luck if you want it \"your way,\" their attitude is \"eff you, go to Burger King.\"",

I like the grilled cheese panini, barbeque chicken salad and most soups except the creamy ones.

Every staff member you come across is so friendly and their restaurant is always clean. My 8 yr. old loves eating here as well, especially because of their complimentary chocolate-covered strawberry with every meal and yummy tasting desserts. Plus they have internet access and charging stations! Give this place a try! You won't regret it.",

The first employee at the counter takes your sandwich order which i gave her my entire order, but she kindly directed me to the next gentleman to order the soup. I felt like it was great customer service! I ordered Turkey Bacon Avocado Panini with a New England Clam Chowder. The Panini looked like it was lacking 'Umph' but the taste was great. The soup was so tasty! It was the perfect amount of pepper and creamy consistency. It also comes with side bread slice and chocolate covered strawberry. I say totally worth it.",

Particularly I enjoyed the grilled corn it the creamy soup. It was delicious . The ultimate grilled cheese was good . I'll try another sandwich next time. My boyfriend choose the crab sandwich . He wasn't a fan of the intimation crab. ( we knew it wasn't going to be real crab , expectation wasn't high) Just wasn't his cup of tea. The soup he choose was the tomato soup. Which is highly recommended here. He wasn't a fan of that either. It has other veggies in it too. But he said there was just too many  flavors in it. A lot  going on in it. He prefers his tomato soup to have more of a tamato flavor. I tried it also . It was too sweet for me. He will try other items next time.  Oh they also give you a complimentary chocolate strawberry! I can't believe u almost forgot ! Almost the best part !! The strawberry was SOO perfect! The temperature & texture was beyond amazing .  I LOVED it.   The staff was nice. Nothing extraordinary . The place was pretty clean . Baby friendly :) They offer high chairs , which is nice since we had our 9month old baby with us. I love the soda fountain offers Italian soda syrups to make your drink your own . Especially since I try not to drink too much soda it's nice to have a different choice on unique sodas :) yummy.",

I am SO happy I decided to try this place while the kids went to Smash Burger. I had the carnitas sandwich combo with a salad. The herb vinaigrette was really good and very flavorful. A little goes a long way. The staff was so helpful and friendly that I happily pulled out some cash to tip but they wouldn't accept!  I ended up sampling a couple of soups and  couldn't decide so got both Irish Stew and the best cream of mushroom I've ever tasted. THe make you own soda syrups made me break my own rule and drink soda.   The chocolate covered strawberries and salted caramel creme brulee were the perfect ending to great meal.  I'm coming back to Las Vegas next week and am already planning to bring the family.",

    "text": "We visited yesterday and were excited to see new menu items. After reviewing the menu we ordered. Everything was rapid fire but the answers to our questions generated crickets. The staff was absolutely ignorant on whether a salad dressing was vegan or not. They couldn't even suggest which dressings could be substituted.    I asked for a sample of the roasted veggie soup which was vegan. It was so salty and overwhelmed the flavor of the soup. I asked the employee if they had a cup soup size. She took forever to answer me and was very vague mentioning a child size soup. There were other employees but she didn't ask them. I replied that it was just as well.  We were rushed through the line and they weren't busy. Perhaps the employees wanted more time to shoot the breeze? Hmmmm.......  We found a perfect place to eat after paying a whopping $29.00+. Zupas doesn't offer a military, student, senior discount,  etc.  It's what I deem True greed. I realize it's a business however they would still make a profit even if they offered a 10% discount.   The meal- my Thai coconut tofu protein salad. Where is all my protein?! There was perhaps an infant's handful size of tofu, some edamene not much, lots of kale, quinoa, a few slices of English cucumber and too much dressing.  My husband's sandwich was good and his soup was ok. The cake was a good size but overpriced of course. The chocolate dipped strawberries were the best part.  Another irritating aspect of Zupas was the lack of calorie and nutritional information.  I asked for this info because I log my meals on my fitness pal. Some employee blithely answered that \"they might get that info in a few months.\" This one employee provided a Greek chorus by apologizung for every little thing.  I say keep your info, keep your food and keep your apologies because we will be eating somewhere else.   Next time we will be eating at the NY Bagel Cafe, Rubio's or one of the many choices here in this fine city of Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Not all chains are created equal and this is a good example. On first glance it might seem just like Panera but as the folks at Cafe Zupas will tell you, everything made fresh, including the soups which are made from scratch on the premises daily. The food is a step up from the majority of fast-casual eateries. The Asian BBQ pork sandwich is reminiscent of a banh mi with its flavors and the size is great for the price ($7.99 for a whole sandwich and small soup combo). The lobster bisque was full of potatoes, vegetables, and other goodness but lacked lobster. I only counted two or three small chunks.  The kid's menu was disappointing. While my kid liked the chicken strips (2 per order), they were rather small and unimpressive looking. The kid's meal requires them to choose 2 of the four options (chicken strips, soup, grilled cheese, or fruit) but they're not allowed to double up on a single item (like 2 orders of chicken). My kid didn't like the texture of the bread for the grilled cheese and I knew he wouldn't touch the soup or fruit. So, on future visits it looks like he'll only eat half of what we pay for.   Desserts were highlights of the meal. The chocolate cake was plenty rich and we loved the different layers and textures of cream, cake, fudge, and crust. The chocolate hazelnut creme brulee was more like a pudding with it's creamy texture, but was good nonetheless. Each meal also comes with a chocolate covered strawberry.  Prices are reasonable and the staff was friendly and informative. I just wish they had a greater selection of bread for sandwiches (especially for the kid's grilled cheese) and a more diverse kid's menu. Otherwise, it's a great option for a quick meal.",

    "text": "Cafe Zupas or Zupas as us Utahans call it, has been a favorite lunch spot of mine for years. I didn't even know there were any in Vegas until a few months ago. Neither of the locations here are close to my home, however I still manage to drop in whenever I'm in the area.  The set up here is easy once you get a feel for the menu. I always do a 'you pick two' combo. I like to do soup and salad, while the bf always orders soup and sandwiches. The ordering process is quick, with plenty of staff to move your order down the line. The staff here is friendly and always has a smile.  My favorite soups are the Tomato Basil, Wild Mushroom Bisque and the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla. I can never decide which one so I always ask for tastings (as if I didn't know what they tasted like...). For Salads I almost always get the Nuts About Berries which I think is called their Chicken Summer Salad at times as well. But I occasionally venture out of the norm and I have to say I've never had a salad here I didn't like.  As for the sandwiches, I often think they are lacking a bit of filling. I love paninis but theirs seem to be a little lacking on the meat. The Honey Bacon Club is probably my favorite.  Each order of soup comes with slice of french bread, and every order comes with a chocolate strawberry. YAY! I've yet to try any of their desserts, but I have to say they always look amazing, so I'm tempted every single time. It's the dang chocolate covered strawberry that plays to my sense of reason and talks me out of it.  The atmosphere at this and all the locations I've visited is just so so. It can often be loud during lunch hour. I like to take my food to go and they actually don't skimp you on the portion sizes when you do. This is a place I'll continue to crave and would frequent if it were close to home.",

All of the salt shakers were sitting on the tables with kid spit all over the part where the salt comes out and the employee did not care. Unacceptable.

Management doesn't see that? 2) Another female employee (didn't catch the name tag), came out and opened up three cartons of blueberries & just threw them in the bin so that Marita(?) could continue making salads.

I decided to get a Bowl and Soup combo, and got the Thai Coconut Tofu bowl and the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup. My favorite part of the bowl was the generous serving of kale and quinoa. I kind of wish it had more tofu, but I still really enjoyed it. The dressing for the bowl was tangy and sweet, it really completed the dish. The star of the show though was the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup. SUPER HEARTY and CREAMY. I practically licked my bowl clean--it was that good~  They also give you a chocolate covered strawberry with your order which devoured pretty quickly  \\_()_/ ",

Second time I got the tomato soup and the Thai Chicken sandwich. Again, the soup was so salty I couldn't finish it. I asked my husband to try it, thinking it must be me, but no. The chicken sandwich was ok, but the chicken was prepared like chicken salad and had way too much dressing. Finally, I tried the veggie sandwich and it was decent, but nothing interesting. The tortilla soup was another salt bomb, neither I nor a friend could eat it. Perhaps their salads are good but I won't be returning to find out.",

Price was good, too. $8.95 and you get 1 chocolate strawberry and a slice of bread with it. Not bad for fresh food. I will take this over fried food anyday. So much on the menu that I will need to come back and try. My sandwhich was the cranberry turkey and salad was mango strawberey salad. My desert was absolutely amazeballs. Light and yummy.

    "text": "I have found my new favorite spot!!!  A little over one week new to the area and the word is out!   I have read the great reviews from the one they opened in the Henderson area and was eager to try this place out.    As we walked in everything was a little overwhelming at first.  Since it is new they had greeters at the front ready to explain their concept and how it all works.  Its all pretty simple - Salad, Soup and/or Sandwich.  A combo includes your choice of 2 for $7.99.  This is similar to the Chipotle style assembly line thing where you tell the servers what you want and they will assemble what you choose.  There is an assorted number of fresh toppings to choose from-meats, cheeses, veges, pastas, nuts, fruits, croutons etc. Better ingredients than any salad bar I've ever been to.  They had a wide range of dressings as well as many fat free and low fat choices which I thought was fantastic!  So you can opt for their salads choices or you can build your own.  If you build your own salad they give your choice of 6 ingredients. You can also choose to add toppings to your soup for $.59.  They have many sandwiches to choose from.  The Ciabatta bread they use is fresh, soft and airy.    Here's a rundown of what we ordered:  *Asian BBQ Pork sandwich - Very flavorful - BBQ sauce was tasty *Salad (create your own). Romaine with Sesame Ginger dressing (fat free & amazing flavor), chicken, ground cashews, feta, apples and croutons - this was my favorite overall *The Italian sandwich - BF really liked the flavor and balsamic spread it had *Roasted Red Pepper Lobster Bisque - was amazing with a little kick and lobster flakey chunks to compliment (I've been to steak houses that don't have this much lobster)  Each combo came with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry.  The drink section has your choices of \"syrups\" to add to your soda.  Recommended recipes are written on the drink cups to give you an idea of how it works.  My BF did the \"rootbeer float\" mixture - 2 squirts of vanilla to your rootbeer.  It was very tasty and was exactly to be expected.  I forgot to mention that had some amazing looking desserts but it was already enough food.  Maybe desserts to-go next time.  BTW you can get any of the food to-go.  The customer service was great.  We were nicely greeted by everyone we came in contact with.  Since its new everyone was on their A game and happy to be there.  I hope that continues.  The place was very clean (new still) and you can tell they spent a lot of time and money on the bright and vibrant decor inside and out.  Its very modern and open with plenty of seating.  They have the recharge bar-but I have no idea what that was about yet.  As we were indulging in our new found favorite food stop we were already planning on coming back the next day.  So as we drove up on Sunday our hearts sank - CLOSED ON SUNDAYS.  Wah wah waahhh.  Sad face.  No worries.  I intend to be back ALOT just not on Sunday..",

All the salads are super yummy (although the dressing is a little heavy-handed sometimes), most of the soups are addicting (try their chunky lobster bisque or creamy, Wisconsin cauliflower), and I really love their ultimate grilled cheese or chicken pesto sandwiches (anything with pesto!).  I was very disappointed with the crab melt sandwich. To me, it was just gross, so I'd never get that again. Everything else I've had there is great, including the desserts. Gotta love the chocolate dipped strawberries that come with every meal.  My two-year-old loves their chicken strips that come with a little side of fruit and bread. He's not really into food, but when we go to Zupas, he digs right in! Great place for kids.",

The Try 2 combo for $8 is probably your best bet with a choice of a full sandwich, a full salad, or a bowl (not cup) of soup. They have a big menu of options, or you can build your own (at least for the salads - maybe not the sandwiches). I've had about four different sandwiches, two salads, and tried four or five soups. It's all CRAZY good, and filling.  Along with your order, you get a piece of french bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. LOVE IT. They have desserts, too, and they are also super good. The salted caramel creme brulee is my favorite, and it's good to combine with a brownie (ultimate fat kid status right here). Even the drink bar has flavored syrups to jazz up your soda or tea.   On top of high quality, tasty food, the staff is really friendly. They're so nice, they make In & Out employees look like jerks, which says a lot. I've only been to the Lake Mead & Buffalo location (there's one also off Eastern), but with how good this place is, I'd imagine they're all on point.   GO TO HERE!",

I decided to give it another try because my friend ranted and raved about how good it was, so I knew I was missing out on something.   Being a vegetarian, sometimes it's hard to find good vegetarian food at restaurants and most of the time they don't have a vast selection, so most of the time if a food item isn't good, I just won't go back, because there will be nothing else to try.  The veggie sandwich that they have set up on the menu is pretty gross to me, but my friend orders it with avocado + grilled on panini instead and it tasted like 200% better!(Seriously get it that way if you go there)  I like the set up of this restaurant to where they can change up the way items are made fairly easy to accommodate everyone's tastes. I also tried the mushroom soup they have and it was delicious as well. I think Zupas may have grown on me again. The service is still great and fast, but it's still crap that we can't tip them.",

Your lunch will run you about ten bucks, with a beverage, if you opt for the combo. Their variety of sandwiches, soups and salads is sure to include something for everyone. You order and pay at the counter so there is no problem splitting the check or waiting around for the check if you are one of those who has a boss watching the clock to make sure you don't take an extra minute during your lunch break.",

We tried to take our family through the order line, but it was just too chaotic with all of the different options. They screwed up two out of the four kids meals and one had to wait for her food for nearly ten minutes after we had started eating. The staff seemed overwhelmed and let other people through the line in front of us. Also, the staff were getting after each other because there were a couple of other large groups all together and orders weren't being put together correctly. I hate to see this kind of stuff going on when I am out to dinner.  The Food: To me, most of the soups taste similarly....not like they are bad, but it really seems like they are all based on the same cream base with just a different theme. Also, the salads all seem very similar. Greens, berries, nuts, etc-just different nationalities assigned to each one. Not bad at all, but they are all just different green salads. Sandwiches: The first time I went there (sans kids) I got a pesto chicken panini and it was good-that's it.  There are a lot of problems with the ordering line. Just getting through the hassle of the line is bad enough, but my kids' food was not right (I think they actually screwed up my order about five different ways), they added some else's order to my bill and then some lady came up to the register and totally interrupted",

I've only been here twice and I thought the second time since there were different workers it'd be different. Nope. Still shitty customer service. The first time the cashier was really rude I asked if they had a certain soup on the menu and she replies with \"the menu is there, can't name every one because I'm about to help another customer\" but I couldn't go back to see the menu cuz there was a line of people standing in front of it. she hands my food while talking to an employee and doesn't even say thank you or looks at me. The second time which wasn't long ago the guy kept asking what I was having and I told him like 3 times not only that the girls were messing up on two orders behind me. I don't understand why they don't keep the orders in ORDER and organized so they don't mess up. Definitely not returning, at least not to this location. Or once they have people who actually know about customer service.",

The staff is hardworking in that they're constantly making sure everything is presentable and they are extremely nice. They definitely value customer service. They also have recharge seats, so you can charge your device while eating, which a phone-aholic like me enjoys.  The place has never been too loud, which I definitely appreciate.  The food is fresh. They boast about it and I believe it, however fresh doesn't always mean good. The sandwiches are average with the exception of their turkey bacon avocado which was awful. Maybe it was just that day but it was poorly made and the avocado was slimy. The only soup that stands out is the lobster bisque, I'm also not a giant soup fan, so that can be taken with a grain of salt. Their salads however will get praise from me all day. I love their salads especially with their strawberry vinegarette.  The combination of great environment and decent food = solid 4 stars",

Honestly, most everything in there seemed unappealing to me but I gave it a shot.   Ordering was a little overwhelming. I felt rushed and while it is lunch hour, I was frazzled with making quick decisions. Guacamole on your salad counts as TWO sides. But it's one tiny scoop. Disappoint.   Anyway, ordered a Turkey Bacon Avocado Sandwich without bacon. (don't judge me.) and a create your own salad that I would've liked to add an egg to but like I said they're very rushed.   So, ate my food. And I can't same I'm too impressed. The salad is a salad is a salad. Sandwich was soggy. And didn't taste as great as I had hoped. It was like eating sandwich meat from the grocery store.   Chocolate covered strawberry was nice.  Bread was weird. Soft but dry and needing something.   Anyway, it was probably just all my decisions regarding what to eat. Probably won't return though.",

So far, I've had the Cuban sandwich with a Summer Chicken salad, both were incredibly yummy, and my 2nd visit was an Ultimate Grilled Cheese with Roasted Red Pepper Lobster soup, also both quite yummy.    I also got the Sea Salt Caramel Creme Brulee and, while it's not a True creme brulee, it's decadent.  I could only eat a small bit of that, though, due to the intense sweetness of the caramel.  Hubs didn't mind ;)  He got the Honey Cilantro Carnitas with Tomato Basil soup on the first visit and the Italian Club sandwich with a German Sausage soup on the 2nd.    Everything got devoured despite the quantities being huge (though Hubs had to eat half of mine in addition to all of his, he was up to the challenge)  We will definitely be back, this place is now on our lunch favorites list :D",

Cafe Zupas is kind of like Panera Bread, serving sandwiches, soups, salads and bakery stuff. The only thing different is Cafe Zupas is much fresher and tastier!   When you first walk in they have large easy to read menu boards. You place your order telling them what you want on what, pay for your food and find a table where your food is brought out to you. They have a pretty good amount of seating offering tables as well booths.   Sandwiches by themselves are $4.99 each, salads by themselves are $4.99 for the half size and $6.99 for the large size, soups are $3.99 for the half size and $5.99 for the large size.  There is a  \"Try 2 Combo\" priced at $7.99 where you can pick from two of the following: - Whole Sandwich - Half Soup - Half Salad   I ordered the \"Honey Bacon Club\" and \"Summer Chicken Salad\" from the try 2 combo. The portion size was great. The honey bacon club is a grilled panini with turkey, ham, bacon, tomatoes, muenster cheese and honey mustard. So good! I will order this one again for sure. The summer chicken salad has chicken, fresh strawberries, cashews, dried cranberries, grapes, mixed greens and strawberry vinaigrette dressing. The salad tasted to fresh and yummy! They have over a dozen salads to choose from so there is a nice variety to choose from each time. A really nice touch was the chocolate covered strawberry that came complimentary with my meal! Hubby got one with his too! Hubby ordered a \"Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup\" that was put of this world delicious! I ended up getting a spoon and sharing it with him it was just so good. The soup is whole heads of cauliflower blended together with cheddar and pepper jack cheese. Bacon was added for an additional 59 cents. Fresh bread also comes with the meal so it was nice to dip in the soup!  So I saw a dessert in the case that called my name. It was the \"Sinful 7 Chocolate Cake\" priced at $4.49 and I got it to-go. This cake is any True chocolate lovers dream come True! It lives up to it's name and is sinfully good.  The drink bar offers 16 different fountain drinks with free Italian Soda flavorings. If you have a device that needs some juice then you can take advantage if the recharge bar. They do offer catering, but if they offer online ordering I didn't see anything about it. There is a sign that says they do not take tips, but will gladly clean up your dishes (yep they use real dishes) and table when you are finished. The customer service was fantastic and the inside was very clean. I will be back!",

Theres a combo option which is less than 8 but make sure you get that size or your order will be more pricy. I also disliked that they are closed on Sundays...

    "text": "Legit deliciousness, y'all.   Several Cafe Zupas have popped up around town. After a night of Vegas debauchery, I decided to get something chock full of nutrients.   Walking in the place was super clean, but really didn't have ambience or a theme. There was plenty of seating with multiple 4 person tables and a few booths.  Getting in line, I saw there was a pick 2 combo. There were selections of sandwiches, salads, and soups. I ordered the crab avocado panini and since it is getting cold out opted for some soup. There were so many soups to choose from, before I had to settle and pick one, I was given as many samples as I wanted. I fell in love, over and over, and decided on the chicken enchilada chili which was nothing like a traditional chili at all. It was divine and I need to get more of it in my life. The cauliflower soup was amazing as was the lobster bisque.   I didn't order any, but they have a slew of fresh baked treats, a million dollar bar, s'mores brownies, cakes, and all sorts of treats that probably would have knocked my socks off.   I paid for much lunch, then took the goods to go. Once I got hole, I saw that my order came with fresh baked bread and 2 chocolate covered strawberries. Nice AND delicious touch.  Zupas was a pleasant surprise. Fast, casual, friendly service and axon fly fresh, wholesome food. The atmosphere on the actually restaurant isn't anything special, it is similar to Panera Bread, but not quite. I can't see myself ever dining in. I will however be taking my order to go. See you soon, Zupas!",

They have a nice selection of soups, salads, sandwiches and desserts, the staff is patient and there's plenty of seating. I decided to try the California club sandwich, the mango, berries and nuts salad and a dessert bar. My favorite thing was the salad. It was really refreshing and the fruit was sweet. The sandwich was pretty average since it was a simple Turkey club. The dessert bar wasnt what I was expecting. I didnt taste much toffee which is the main reason why I got it. I like that the give you bread and a chocolate covered strawberry with the meal. It was a nice place to try, and I wouldn't mind coming back for the salads and strawberries when I'm in the area.",

It's consistently poor customer service and they seem unable to customize their \"standard\" menu of salads. Other locations, it's not a problem.   Last time I was here (like 3 days ago) the salad maker passed on my greens to the \"topper\" who put hard boiled eggs on after I requested none. I'm allergic to eggs, but not deathly (I get a rash), so I took them off my salad and went on with my life.   Today took the cake though! Lyle the District Manager was working the salad bar. This guy isn't a fit for Cafe Zupas.  1) He corrected an employee on the floor for not correctly rotating the plastic salad clam shells for to go orders during the lunch rush. Not cool to shout it out loud enough for the customers in line 8 people from the glass to hear. Learn how to coach your partners, Lyle! Also, learn to prioritize when you have a line. Customer service trumps \"rotating\" or FIFO (first in, first out) a non-perishable item. The way things where flying out the door I'm pretty sure those were all going to be used by the end of day. Also, you're welcome!! She was stocking your supplies for you. Instead of mansplaining how to put a piece of plastic properly on the counter, you could have said thank you. And dropped the condescending attitude. 2) When it was my turn to order, I too was treated to Lyle's amazing personal interactions. I asked if I could make a custom salad in either the half or whole size, which seemed to confuse it at first. Then he said I could do whatever I wanted. I asked for a half salad. He asked,\"Don't you want to try one of our salad combos instead?\" His tone was clearly that he couldn't be bothered to make a customized salad. It was patronizing and rude. I politely answered that I have tried many of the salads on the menu but would like to make a customized salad (which is very clearly also listed on the menu, FYI). He should sighed and asked me what I wanted. I selected my greens in a half salad for here. He wanted to know what dressing I wanted and I asked which ones had gluten in them. He basically repeated the allergy sticker from the glass that says there is cross contamination potential. So I asked,\"Can you tell me which dressings have gluten intentionally added to them?\" He said he didn't know, all their salad dressings haven't changed so whatever I've had would be the same  and pointed to the list of dressings on the glass. The whole time he's like pacing back and forth to and from the glass making giant arm gestures, clearly upset. I chose the fresh herb vinaigrette.   3) I had an amazing topping employee (Her name might have been Asia?). She was so friendly and kind. She had excellent customer service, knew her fresh ingredients and was very engaging.  4) Our food expediter at the dessert c",

    "text": "We were in the vicinity with a couple hours to kill. The husband was in a sandwich mood, while I was in the please do not drive any more further mood, which made Cafe Zupas our lunch spot. I've been wanting to come here for all the years we've had to pass it on a weekly basis. We entered and there was no line, hallelujuer. We took the time to stare at the menu, but didn't take too much time as we quickly knew were going to have their pick 2 combo. You choose 2 between their salads, sandwiches, and soups. We both opted for soup and a sandwich.   I got the vegetarian sandwich when I really meant to order their chicken pesto, but I was torn and by the time i ordered...vegetarian sandwich just vomited out my mouth. Doh! I wasn't bummed or anything because the sandwich itself was as good as a sandwich with cucumbers, tomatoes, sprouts, greens, red peppers, muenster cheese, with red pepper hummus smeared inside could possibly be. No sarcasm, seriously.   Lover man got the Cuban grilled pork panini. He took a bite and pointed at it as he chewed, nodded his head with the hell yeah that's good in silent film tone. I wouldn't know because I declined his offer to try. He couldn't finish the other half to his sandwich, so when the kids got home...they were fighting over it. Apparently it was pretty good.   Nevermind the touchscreen charging station, or the spacious and clean dining area, rolling and working highchairs, extremely friendly and helpful staff, touchscreen coca cola drink machine thingy, the free chocolate covered strawberry you get with each meal and bread...but that cauliflower soup was my yumgasm of the day!  They ask if you want bacon and/or cheese topped onto your soup...i skip the bacon and opted for the cheese. The heat of the soup melted that cheese into a gooey compliment. Sure there were a time or two the cheese kinda got caught.up on my chin, snagged on my tonsils...but hey...nothing I couldn't handle. Lol. But, it was so good! I literally have tried recreating it at home two times since last week. If you don't find cauliflower purposeful so you don't bother consuming it...cauliflower has lots of vitamins in it so while the soup isn't the healthiest form to consume it, CONSUME IT! Dip that free bread all up in it is you want. I didnt, but if I didn't all ready have a sandwich I wouldve. The husband ordered their clam chowder. He didn't say anything. Probably because after tasting my soup it shut his clam chowder down. Lol.  I love that everything is house-made, and locally or sourced nearby. It really makes a difference. 8.99 for the pick2. You can easily spend the same.or less and get a plate lunch/dinner...so it really is up to you and your mood as to how you want to spend your 9 bucks. For the hubs and I, Cafe Zupas was just what we were in the mood for and it satisfied us. We had a great experience. Hopefully, it doesn't go downhill as we will certainly be returning.  Definitely kid and stroller friendly!  Enjoy!",

I walked up towards a girl who apparently a shift lead. She looks at me and say what can I get for you! I was taken back a little and informed her it was my first time. She then went on explaining the menu during her explanation of the menu she stops in the middle and ask another coworker to get something which i thought was rude. She than comes back to me and says so what can I get for you. I was over it and proceeded down to the next girl who was amazing. Overall experience was good, just a tad bit of training on customer service.",

Lost all respect for Zupas! They need to be more careful especially since peanut allergies are very common.",

I noticed the bill was MUCH higher than usual and noticed that for a bowl of soup that has bacon and cheese included in menu description (which I have purchased in past at standard price) now listed everything other than the soup as an add on. so it was 1.50 more per bowl. I had a panini and when I picked it up I noticed there was no bread on the bottom of the sandwich. it appeared that it stuck to the grill but they served it any way. The manager was too busy to discuss it so I argued with rude girl at counter glad when second location near me opens so don't have to go back here.",

Today I had hair in my soup.  When I took the bowl back up to them they asked if I wanted the same soup again rather than taking that soup out and putting fresh soup in. Then the salad I got had more tortilla strips than salad.   I won't be back. Done!!!  Panera Bread here I come!!!",

Then watched everyone make the items, one of my favorite things is the California salad. It's delicious. And their sandwiches are all very good as well.

Last time and this time, I found myself craving a good lobster bisque but while I appreciate them giving samples, I have never followed through. It lacks in flavor and robustness that I expect it to have. On the other hand, my meal was very flavorful and filling. I didn't need to order dessert because it came with a chocolate covered strawberry which was appreciated. All in all, I like this place. Do I wish I got a little more bang for my buck? Of course. Over $10 for a sandwich and half salad without a drink is not what I normally would like to swing very often. But for an every now and then treat, I would say it's okay.  Some people compare it to Panera, but I feel the quality and freshness is just as good. It doesn't have as many baked goods as options but the desserts they have on display are extremely tempting.",

Food has always tasted great and service was excellent. But when we first walked in and up to the counter, the young woman (her name tag said Kayley) taking our order was extremely rude. She didn't greet me and wouldn't make eye contact with me, yet she held a marker in her hand and was just standing there staring towards the back of the restaurant. I waited for her to look at me as a cue that she was ready to take down my order. So I stood there for a minute. She rolled her eyes and said in a huffy tone, \"whenever you're ready.\" I had been ready since I walked in and my family even knew what they wanted since we looked up the menu ahead of time. I was waiting on her, but okay, I politely made my order, a bbq chicken salad and tomato soup. Without any eye contact, she barks at me \"for here or to go!\" I tell her \"for here.\" Then my mom orders her salad and the girl rolls her eyes! Sheesh... sorry for inconveniencing you by coming into your place of work. Guess we won't be back.   Also, my husband's roasted veggie and quinoa soup had zero quinoa and only a few sad tomatoes and pieces of celery. It was mostly bland broth. I wonder if they changed their recipe, since this soup used to be so delicious. My food tasted okay, but the staff member's attitude definitely put a bad taste in my mouth.   I sent an email to corporate about my experience and I have not heard back. Maybe they are okay with their staff treating customers poorly.",

I placed my salad order and my sandwich, I went through the line as per usual, once I got to the register the girl gives me my total. Barely paying any attention, I put my card in the machine and the girls states the card machine is down and asks if I have any cash. So annoyed that I just went through this whole process, I look at her and tell her no I don't have any cash. So they bag up my food and tell me no worries, the meal is on them for the day.  I was barely attention because I was confused as to what just happened. It completely made me entire day and I thought that was awesome customer service. I've been to many places that when the card machine is down, they tell you that they can only take cash and then I usually end up having to leave.

Drinks turmeric infused and other refreshing summer drinks available. $13.27 for my combo that's with drink and strawberry dessert!",

I opted for the sandwich and salad combo option. I decided on the \"nothing but berries\" salad and the vegetarian cocinut infused tofu sandwich. It was so good, my salad was so sweet and fresh with the yummy poppy seed dressing.   My vegetarian tofu sandwich on wheat was so tasty. I really enjoyed the fresh clean flavor of this combination.   I am a new fan of this cafe and am already eager for my next visit!",

I get there and Ashley pleasantly greeted me asked if it was my first time and also gave great recommendations. She blew me away when I said too go, she quickly and efficiently took my order and got me out fast. I didn't even have to say I was in a hurry, this young girl went above and beyond and made my day.

The salad portion seemed to be much smaller than before but the coupe de grace was when my daughter found a long blond hair in her tomato basil soup. That as absolutely disgusting!!! I called the restaurant and asked for the manager who was apologetic but did not offer to replace the soup. As expensive as this place is I expected more from the manager. I definitely won't be going back.  I much rather go to Kneaders any day.",

I give only 4 stars because the salad is never consistent... sometimes the toppings are scarce, sometimes there's plenty. Would help if they massaged the kale before hand too as that helps to reduce the bitterness. I do kale because it's literally the healthiest thing salad wise to get and the toppings are great if there's enough of them! Otherwise I feel like a rabbit straight up.  Other than that the employees are awesome, dining area is always clean, and the service is quick! Love that they give you a bread roll and chocolate covered strawberry when you get the pick 2 meal... though most times I indulge in dessert any way!",

I understand they can't guarantee any items being gluten free due to cross contamination, but depending on the employee, you'll get a different answer on what items don't contain gluten based ingredients. On my last visit I realized they had done away with the chicken tortilla soup which had always been a safe option. When I asked girl 1 behind the counter, she had no idea and asked girl 2 who told me the chicken noodle and the chickpea vegetable were the options. I told her that didn't make sense for the chicken noodle and ordered the other. I then overheard girl 3 say to girl 2 that the chicken enchilada was okay, which I'm pretty sure is not True. The lack of consistency is almost more of a concern to me than the lack of basic food allergy knowledge.",

    "text": "Cafe Zupas is a nice place to meet friends for lunch. They offer three item-types: salads, sandwiches, and soups and you can buy each as an entree or buy 1/2 of 2 items to make a meal (e.g., 1/2 salad and 1/2 soup, 1/2 soup and 1/2 sandwich). They also offer truly delectable desserts.  The ingredients are fresh and the food good; the beverage bar is excellent. The bar includes all the regular soda fountain items and has Torani syrups you can add on your own. In addition, they offer several natural drink options like cucumber green tea and citrus-infused water. With every meal, you receive a piece of bread and chocolate-dipped strawberry.   The place is always impeccably clean in the restaurant and bathroom. They bus the tables and regularly ask if you need anything (like boxes).   The reason I don't like Zupas as much as other places is that the food does not fill me. Even when asking for extra lettuce on a salad (including if I pay extra for lettuce), there isn't much. I need lots of lettuce to fill me and even buying two full salads is barely enough. Instead, I go to Cafe Rio across the street because they will pile on the lettuce if you ask. Also, they do not offer bread bowls for their soups so I go to Panera down the street instead.   Zupas has great food, the restaurant is a wonderful place to meet others, and the staff is great, but the food portions simply don't satiate my hunger.",

You pay an overpriced 2.19 price for a fountain drink or in my case for their juice waters only to walk to the drink station and find out must of their drinks are out of service. On the food side, we ordered a sandwich which by the time it was time to pay was not ready yet, so they said they would bring it to the table, only that it took them more than 10 mins to bring it to us. Honestly, go to a different location, either the centennial or the Charleston but run from this one. Never again!",

Now for my big beef.  This place OFTEN has more people working than eating.  Still, I find I have to repeat my order two times FOR SURE, often more.  It is really awkward the way they are set up behind the counter.  So please I beg you Zupas if you are listening, do something - anything - so that I do not have to repeatedly explain what I ordered or didn't order to several people every time.  It is annoying and I eat here less because of it.  With so many employees you could readily have someone shadow the customer and convey the order.  Or write it down, like every other restaurant.",

Actually, this is one of the few places I will buy an \"overpriced\" drink, purely because of the options they have. While we're on the topic of price, yeah I know we all think it. Dropping nearly 20 bucks a person with drink, dessert (you can't say no), tax and tip? It's not an easy place to frequent, and becomes more of an easy-going spot to take friends. Because if you don't go with someone who knows how to order, you will be utterly confused your first time.",

My first sandwich was a good size, the second was smaller, and this last one was the smallest. Granted I get the panini but this last sandwich, I was like where's the artichoke. There were only these slivers of artichokes, 4 half slices of tomatoes, like 3/4 leaves of spinach and 2/3 slices of turkey. So based on my 3 experiences I and giving 3 stars of the overall and an extra one for the cream of mushroom soup. It's the soup that's has me coming back in all honesty.  As I was leaving, I'm assuming the manager asked about my experience. I told her about the sandwich and she rectified the situation. Customer service is a 10",

I have tried two salads and two soups and was pleased with them both.  All of the ingredients tasted fresh and they get bonus points for providing a generous amount of dressing on the side (I don't like dry salads).

    "text": "Hey important review if you're diabetic or have high blood pressure this place is not for you! The amount of sugar that is in the homemade dressings have a ton of sugar in it like about 6 cups of sugar for one batch on dressing that is sick no dressing should have that much in it, also all the salt in the soup is a extensive amount  which is not necessary. I ate only half a small bowl and I got so dizzy I felt so sick and I am a healthy person. They also have no calorie chart to count your intake of calories in each dish. The manager that I tried to talk to at this location was dismissive when I asked why is the soup so watery her responses was it was made this morning when I got there 12:34 PM. so giving any kind of constructive criticism wasn't in the cards. The manager's name is Alisha she was not only rude but rolled her eyes when talking to her in line. The other 2 employee's that I spoke to apologized for her actions. I told them that was not necessary that it was not there fault for her actions. I asked some employee's if they ate here at Zupas they said they will never eat the food because of how much sugar and salt was in it! Shame! They also said the manager there is always dismissive often and they have to work with a person like that and they said again sorry for her actions. They told me to contact district manager for her being that way. His name is Lyle. The only high light was I got to meet a news anchor from channel 8.  So if you want to eat healthy this is not the place for you SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR PLUS SALT SALT AND MORE SALT. NO CALORIE COUNTER CHART! If you need a sugar salt rush and want to feel like you want to die for that day ha-ha go here. Hope this is helpful to the wise. You would think it's healthy but after going to several Dr. office's on just normal visits they tell me they would never eat at this place. Just alone the amount of sugar in the dressing is so unhealthy... Followed by so much salt be wise and ask.. Don't be fooled with taste!",

They're putting less soup in your bowl, to ensure that even if you order a large soup you're still only getting half, and the soups themselves aren't as good as they used to be. The mushroom soup, for example, is a bowl of cream. Perhaps if you are lucky they'll actually give you a single mushroom. They also have a tendency to mix up your food, so definitely check it before you leave. I've also noticed this location being randomly closed when the sign says they should be open.",

If you ask for more lettuce (which is the cheapest ingredient) they will tell you that they are only allowed to five you a prepositions amount. If you watch them place the lettuce in your bowl you will find that it is not pre portioned at all, it's just whatever amount of lettuce the server decided to put in your bowl. Prepare to be dissatisfied for paying for a $5 salad that looks like a ration. I've had great experiences at all Zupas up until this visit. Please decrease the price of your salads if you are going to ration the ingredients. And if you are going to ration and claim to give pre prepared amounts, consider actually using a measuring utensil so it is consistent rather than claiming you are giving the allowed amour when previous visits have been quite different. I suggest getting a quality assurance rep.",

That was 3 weeks ago and I've eaten here at least 6 times since. I love it, convenient location, fresh food, great desserts, quick service and for under $10 you get a fantastic meal. The food is consistently good, fresh and prepared right in front of you. Not sure on a soup you might like, they have at least 8 to choose from, all delicious and vegetarian friendly options too, best part, ask for a sample so you can make a good choice. The salads are crisp, fresh and bursting with flavor. They manage to put the perfect amount of dressing on every time. My favorites are Lobster Bisque soup with strawberry chicken salad, yum. The grilled cheese and mushroom soup is another i like as well as  the red pepper lobster soup, its all so good. Try it, trust me you simply will NOT be disappointed. Oh and the other great thing they do, is EVERY order gets a fresh Belgian chocolate covered strawberry FREE",

My friend ordered a Italian club panini and tomato basil soup. The panini was ok, nothing to make it great, but the soup was too sweet and had a funny taste to it. If these soups are made from scratch they really need to initiate a quality check program.  Definitely not going back to Cafe Zupa again.",

So far I am absolutely in love with their Wisconsin Cauliflower soup, it is so rich and creamy. All soups come with a side of bread for dipping, which I love. I am also nuts about the Nuts About Berries salad, the cinnamon almonds are genius! I've also tried their pulled pork, Asian BBQ pork, and Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwiches. The sandwiches are not gourmet or the best sandwiches in the area, but they are pretty good, especially when they are coupled with soup and/or salad. To top everything off, everyone gets a chocolate covered strawberry with their meal! What?! How can this tiny gesture make me so happy? I don't know, but it does! I've heard great things about their other desserts, but haven't tried any yet. This is a fantastic lunch option any day of the week, except Sundays, because they are closed on Sundays.",

They did not have the chocolate covered strawberry and were offering a chocolate covered oreo. I asked the one girl if I could have bread instead and she agreed. The cashier said you do not get bread with a sandwich and tossed my bread back into the basket and I tried to explain and she said there was a charge for bread. I passed. I think in the future I will just go to the one in Henderson.",

Brought my sandwich up to the counter and asked Janet in her green chef coat if it was normal to have only two leaves of spinach on this sandwich with it in the name and all and she says yes it is instead of trying to fix this easily fixable issue. I went and said if that is the case that is fine and I won't be back. Sorry to say $30 later a pile of trash in front of me I wish I went to subway. Would have been a better meal. Believe me this is not a plug for subway this is just how horrible Zupas was in my experience at this specific location. I did rather enjoy them in Henderson on eastern but they rather have hearded guests through the line then rather make sure they put out the quality expected of this fresh food chain.",

So, this blonde girl in a red uniform shirt, greets you after the soup area, \"hi guys...\" asks you your order and completely mixes up the order with either the one before us or after us. See, the problem is that she is focused on two customers at the same time, therefore, providing poor service. It was a busy time, I get it... but doing what she was doing doesn't make it right. So, long story short, after I say what was my order, three f*kng times, she ended up giving us the wrong sandwich. We sat down, wondered what sandwich it was and immediately stood up to return it after realizing that it was not what we ordered. Instead of this girl, apologizing for her mistake, she grabbed the plate with the wrong sandwich, got another plate, handed it to me, in a rush, with no sense of being sorry for what she did. So, I spoke up and told her, \"hey, you can apologize instead of looking away\" ---- did that happen? No it didn't. And to make it worst, she handed me the WRONG sandwich (again). At that point, I took a deep breath, sat down, and ate my soup instead.  Not one manager or supervisor came....  This for sure would be the last time I am dining at this restaurant.",

    "text": "Four stars for fresh and flavorful food and healthy marketing. Two stars for lack of availability of nutritional information- from a widespread chain that should have this information readily available.  I'm on a health kick and have had this place bookmarked for a while. This location is close to my work, and I viewed their online menu to make my selections prior to going. I track calories and ran into extreme difficulty trying to get any info at all on this- none on their company website, a few dishes with info around the web, but all with unusually high numbers considering the dish descriptions.  Ultimately opted for the crab avocado melt sandwich combo with the cup of mushroom bisque- love how you can sample soups before ordering. Considering I got info that the particular sandwich was nearly 900 calories, I only ate half. Appreciated the gesture of including a slice of bread and a chocolate-dipped strawberry dessert with my combo, which was well-priced at under $9 with tax and did not ask for a tip on the receipt.  Food was tasty, but sandwich was underwhelming considering the calories I was lead to believe I was \"paying\" for it. Soup was damn delicious though. Would go back for a soup and salad combo.  Seriously though- make your nutritional information available online and in stores (even if it's a brochure behind the counter by request!). Given the number of food allergies and the healthy image projected here, this should be expected.",

This behavior takes away the enjoyment of coming to a restaurant having a meal.  They literally count every single item placed on a salad.  Unfortunately, I come to this restaurant as it is one of the healthier options in my area.  I wish I could record the faces of the employees when asking them to add multiple items to my salad.

I said let's give this place a try and they agreed.    I was expecting a quaint little mom and pop style cafe, boy was I wrong.  I was  surprised to see how large  and full of energy this place was even though it was a Saturday afternoon.  We were greeted and shown menu's and the host even explained there combo special which seemed like a fair deal. The Two fer was any combo of sandwich, salad and soup.  Perfect! for me this way I could explore the menu and have a great lunch to carry us through our eventful day off from work.   The setup was a little overwhelming being my first time but one or two more times and I should be a pro.  Once we started ordering things really started to move fast. Several team members were asking what we wanted and herding us through the line like cattle going to off slaughter, then BOOM!! We were at the cashier and paying for our food before we knew what happened.  We were a little confused as to what just occured.  As we sat down tasting our food everything was hot, fresh, and made from quality ingredients.  The food was very flavorful and while reading the menu and other things around the restaurant the food was also sourced locally (Utah and California).   My entire family enjoyed their meal and I am sure we will be back to try the many variety of soups ,salads and sandwiches.  Oh yeah I almost forgot to mention they give you a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert. Yumm!",

I think of CZ as a step below Panera Bread.You roll the dice on if there is going to be a long line and crowded tables depending on what time of the day you go.  The line usually moves rather quickly, but almost so fast that most employees don't spend much time even really acknowledging you because they are busy prepping your food. There are a few dessert options to choose from if the chocolate dipped strawberry you get as a complimentary snack is not enough. I don't think the extra slice of bread that they give you is even necessary, but it is good to use as a scoop for your soup. I've never had an issue or concern about the preparation and or freshness of the food. The soups are usually overly salty for me, but that just my preference.  There is an employee who works in the dining area and helps keep the tables and drink station clean which is great with the cafeteria style atmosphere that CZ offers.",

I always get the same one since it came out Cherry Balsamic Chicken on fresh greens.  I cannot get enough of it BUT I do like just about everything I have ordered and will drive out of my way to pick up ToGo if I have the craving and I have the craving a lot.  I love that they also give you a big hunk of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry with every order.  Great for catering your parties too.  Tell them Chef Sandra sent you!",

I gave it 4 stars because I have felt rushed when I was ordering, other than that everything was great.",

    "text": "First, I'll just get this out of the way before I go on my rant. The food there is a 6 out of 10. It's ok but nothing to go crazy about.  Here's where I go crazy. I hate this place! The only reason I've been here maybe 6 or 7 times is because my 11 yr old daughter loves it. Why? I have no clue. Maybe it's because she doesn't have to deal with that complete cluster f**k of a mess when you try to order and the painful process of walking that line all the way to the register.  So I order my sandwiches at the first stop, then stop 2 is salads and you either order salads or keep moving down the line to soups. Then I stop to give them my soup order and then I'm getting asked what I ordered! Why? You would think maybe so they can hook the correct soup with the correct sandwich. Nope! Not sure why they ask because they're just putting soup bowls on the tray.  After that, you arrive at the register and they ask you for a 3rd time \"what did you order?\" At which point, I'm about to lose it and freak out on all of them. It's so unorganized and when someone like me orders for the entire family and I have to remember all 6 sandwiches, what soups go with what sandwiches and then I have to repeat it a total of 3 times? Not to mention they rush you and that doesn't help when you're trying to get through the process so you can just sit down and eat.  You people need to get your act together! I can understand this happening the first couple days of grand opening but by this point, one would think that this place would have streamlined this process! Nope! It's gotten worse as time goes on.  At this point, I'm willing to bribe my daughter with just about anything up to and including a car for her 16th birthday to prevent having to go to this place again! If you dare go here after reading these reviews about what a cluster it is, make sure you come armed with Xannax or your medical marijuana cuz you'll need it 10 mins into this circus! I'll get my soup and sandwiches elsewhere!",

There was a women at the entrance giving suggestions, and there were a lot of people in the food making line who were more than happy to give me as many free soup samples as I wanted.  I had the combo with tomato soup and the crab melt. Soup was delicious and if I didn't get the tomato, the other contender was the cauliflower. The melt was ok because it was made with Krab, not Crab. I guess I should have expected it with an $8 combo.  In addition, they have device charging stations, Italian soda station and ample seating.  I would definitely come back next time I'm in the area to have the cauliflower soup and honey club.",

    "text": "Came to Cafe Zupas thanks to their colorful flyer in our mail toting 50% off your order during their grand opening!  I told the wifey & kids, \"I know where we're going this weekend for a cheap lunch!\"  And that was that.  Upon arriving at the new Cafe Zupas location (next to that yummy Pinkbox Donuts), imagine my surprise...BUSY!  PACKED!  Line out the friggin' door and almost around the building.  Come on Zupas....thought that flyer was only meant for ME!?  Apparently not.  Half of Las Vegas was at Zupas on this lovely afternoon.  Probably waiting in anticipation for me to arrive.  But most likely not.  But...maybe.  Cafe Zupas serves house-made soups, salads, and sandwiches.  I do like me a good sandwich.  This Utah chain boasts good food at good prices.  I'm happy to say the prices for their eats are more reasonable than aforementioned places like Panera Bread (got I hate going there for the mere fact everything is overpriced), and the now closed Atlanta Bread Company (which I kinda liked).  You know me, if it's cheap then I'm down.  But it's gotta taste at least somewhat good.  The line for the day was long, but it went rather quickly.  Cafe Zupas is kinda like a cafeteria, order on down the line, pay at the end.  It was nice that everything looked fresh and not frozen, and your food wouldn't be made until you ordered it (unless it's a soup of course).  Very, very reasonable prices at Zupas, a large bowl of soup runs $6, a half order $4, sandwiches are $5 each, and salads run $7 for a large, a half for $5.  Desserts run for around $3 - $4 each, and there's a kid's meal combo for only $4.  But the best deal on the menu is probably the Try 2 Combo for $8, and you get two choices of soup & salad, salad & sandwich, or sandwich & soup.  Your selections can be from anything on the menu.  Very nice if this is your first time to Cafe Zupas, gives you some options to try a bit of everything.  This is what our family stuck with, four of the Try 2 Combos.  We had:  -New England Clam Chowder -Nuts About Berries Salad -MangoBerry Salad -Shanghai Chicken Salad -Crab Avocado Melt Panini -Asian BBQ Pork Sandwich -California Turkey Sandwich -Italian Club Sandwich  Food?  Not bad for a healthy lunch!  Salads were full of fresh fruits and veggies, especially the berry salad.  The crab panini was very good, grilled and gooey.  The big surprise though was the Asian BBQ pork sandwich, it tasted like a bahn mi!  If it was on French bread it would have been killer!  That is my main gripe about Cafe Zupas - no choice of bread.  All they have are ciabatta buns.  I love ciabatta buns but it depends what kind of filling is in between.  Ciabatta goes great with the Italian Club, the bun just sops up the fat lovely from meats like salami.  If Zupas had another choice of bread it would be stellar.  Maybe a ciabatta OR a French roll?  But I know you gotta keep food costs down.    Overall a great lunch.  Like how if you order soup you get a chunk of French bread for dipping, and with each order you get a chocolate covered strawberry.  Very chic, making me feel like I'm at some fancy bistro.  I did the corner of the vast array of hot sauces, I do enjoy a good kick!  I also like how Zupas serves Coca-Cola products!  Also very cool of them to have a section for Italian syrups so you can create your own Italian soda!  But guys, you need to have some cream or half & half on the side to complete this.  I got away super CHEAP for lunch on grand opening.  With the 50% off special, for our orders, drinks, and a little dessert, the tab was just over $20!  We had some leftovers for later too.  That's cheaper than going to the local Buffet @ Asia.  Just too bad the 50% off wasn't everyday!  Not a bad deal even at regular price for this type of food and atmosphere.  Workers were very friendly and helpful, even on a super busy grand opening day.  I will probably be back here again for a cheap lunch when I'm thinking healthy.",

Still, it was loud in there, so much that I had a hard time ordering my food. The employees across the counter were either not speaking loud enough, or I'm going deaf. They also talked very quickly and I had to ask them to repeat things several times. Also, a small observation for the management. There was a Zupas employee standing at the entrance of the ordering line holding menus. We approached her and assumed she would give us a menu or answer questions. Instead, she instructed us to walk around her and did not offer a menu. There was no one else in line but she wanted us to walk thru the pylons that form the ordering line. It was odd because the employee served absolutely no purpose that I can determine.  After ordering, I went to the restroom and discovered that the low-water use faucet is prone to splash off the sink and got my crotch area nice and wet. So now I've got to walk out with looking like I peed myself a bit.   I had a cobb salad with chicken that was pretty good and a cauliflower soup that was very good. The portions are decent, maybe a touch small for the price. I'll give Zupas another shot in a few weeks because I'm eager to try the sandwiches. Maybe the manager can ask the staff to talk louder and slower for those us that (apparently) are becoming hard-of-hearing.",

    "text": "5 stars for the soups 3 stars for the sandwiches   Whenever I eat here, the lobster bisque and the wild mushroom bisque are a must. The consistency of both soups are always perfect - thick, very luscious and creamy. They are also slightly sweet, richly decadent, packed with quality ingredients and incredible flavor.  On the other hand, I'm not too crazy about their sandwiches. I haven't found a sandwich that that blew away my tastebuds yet. Their sandwich options are unique, but they are also lacking the body of flavor and substance that would typically impress me - they are all so dry and bland.  SOUPS: - Lobster Bisque - I am seriously addicted to this soup! Plus, I love the generous chunks of vegetables swimming in the soup, it makes for a satisfying and comforting meal in itself. 5/5 - Wild mushroom bisque - This is another winning soup. The wild mushroom flavor is extremely complex and savory. You can really taste the earthiness and nuttiness of the wild mushrooms in every sip. 5/5 - Tomato bisque - Slightly tart, slightly sweet and very comforting. This is a great choice with grilled cheese. 4/5  SANDWICHES:  - Honey Cilantro Carnitas - the pulled pork was moist, but it is also pretty bland and not seasoned properly. Also, the honey cilantro glaze sounds amazing, but it didn't have a pleasant taste to it - it tasted like processed ingredients and chemicals (even though they advertised it to be \"house-made\") The sandwich filling: cabbage, non-existent pickled red onion and bread were also very dry and not memorable. 3/5 - BBQ Pulled Pork - they used the same pulled pork as in the carnitas sandwich above - so the meat was moist, but bland. I also wasn't a fan of the BBQ sauce that they used. The sauce didn't have any bold, sweet, or tangy flavor - it was too basic and generic. The overall filling and flavor was very dry and boring. 2/5 - Pesto Chicken Panini - the pesto flavor was extremely weak and the chicken was very plain. The overall panini was dry and bland. 2/5 - Crab Avocado Melt Panini - my boyfriend enjoyed this one the most. The crab flavor isn't strong, possibly because they used imitation crab? But the avocado made the sandwich creamy and the bacon added a necessary saltiness. 3/5  This is a dependable lunch spot and I hope I find a sandwich I'm crazy about soon. I love that they stand out in a crowd of sandwich shops by giving away complimentary chocolate covered strawberries! A sweet treat is always appreciated at lunch.",

It's a little confusing when you walk in and look at the board because they don't have prices next to half the items, so you search until you get to the bottom that says \"two combo deal $8.99\". Which means you can have a sandwich plus soup, or plus salad, or soup and salad. Just weird in my opinion. Also drink prices are not listed, in fact after I got and paid for an apple juice I didn't even know they had a soda machine hidden behind the techy wall. Of course I have no idea what a small, medium or large would have cost me. Strange layout, almost need to have come before to understand it.  I opted for the ham bacon club, and a bowl of lobster bisque. Both were actually pretty tasty. I didn't taste much bacon on the club, but the honey mayo mustard sauce was good. The lobster bisque wasn't bad either considering, its not top quality restaurant good but decent enough. Overall, a tasty meal for $11.31.  Staff was friendly and bubbly, not sure if it was lunch or a shift change of many of the employees were eating at the same time I was. Rest of the place was pretty quiet at 2pm.",

Soup, by far is some of the best you'll ever try.  They always add a seasonal soup to the menu.  They recently changed the Swiss Onion for an incredible Butternut Squash soup.  Seriously, I think its the best I've ever had.  I love the Italian Soda bar.  You can mix your own.  WiFi stations are available. Cool place.  Great Service.  Great Prices.

I was disappointed with the small portion size. The pulled pork was very small more bread than anything else. Less than a tablespoon of meat on the sandwich. The Kale salad was suppose to be mixed with Quinoa which I am sure it may have been except I nor anyone on my table could find any. Not a place to go if you are very hungry as the portions are not real big. The food was okay, nothing to write home about.  I might try a different location to see if they are all the same.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times. Once with my family, once with a friend, once alone and once with my sister. Every time I feel like I spent a bit too much. Also, I don't think I've ever left there feeling happy either. It's bright and noisy.  But then again, it is more of a family place.   They do have their non-negotiable menu. It's simple, it's pretty and everything sounds good. They have their set up assembly line style. Ordering is easy. If you have any troubles, the employees in line will throw out a suggestion or two. I've tried the Crab Avocado Melt, the Turkey Bacon Avocado (I think you can tell that I like avocado) and the Asian BBQ Pork. The Crab and the Turkey were pretty good (they're paninis) but the Asian BBQ Pork is sticky and kind of a pain to eat. It is good, but I'm better off buying a Bahn Mi. Bahn Mis are usually cheaper too. I haven't tried their salads. They didn't seem interesting enough for me. Their soups are never hot, they're always this awkward warm temperature. I'm not sure if they could microwave them, but if I'm paying $7.99 for soup and a sandwich, I'd expect the food to be adequate. I've tried the Lobster Bisque which isn't bad. I've also had their Swiss Onion Soup that's a temporary item. It was good. Another thing is that their soup station was messy. I saw the assembly food line workers chatting amongst themselves, so I'm pretty sure they had time to at least wipe it down.   With the $7.99 combo, it comes with a slice of cold bread loaf and a chocolate dipped strawberry. Sexy, huh? Yeah, I guess it could be sexy... Unless you think fruit bugs and leaves are sexy. (Not judging if you are!) The first issue I had with the strawberries is that there were leaves MELTED IN WITH THE CHOCOLATE. Honestly, how could you miss that?  How can you expect your customers to NOT notice it? Luckily that time, I brought it up and they switched it out. Easy. Done. I didn't even have to ask them to switch it out. Tonight was another story. After my sister ate her strawberries, she started freaking out because a bug that crawled out of the bag. It was a tiny bug. Like the kinds you find with the berries you didn't wash yet. First, I brought the bag to the cashier. I asked if they wash the berries or if they even inspect them or whatever. She's like, \"Yeah, we wash them. Sorry about that.\" in the most \"omg, it's late and I just want to get out of here. It's not my fault you have issues.\" attitude ever.  Didn't offer if I want to talk to the manager or anything. That was a problem for me. I'm like, \"okay, thanks I guess.\"  I waited for a bit and waited until a busser came by. I told her what happened and she brought out Joe, the manager. Joe explained to me that it's corporate policy that the berries come pre-washed. He said the chocolate wouldn't stick to it otherwise. He then said they would keep an extra eye out when they inspect it in the morning. He offered another dessert or another strawberry, which was nice. We didn't take it, we were a bit grossed out by the bug.   Yeah, I can say (with a lot of confidence) that we won't be returning there. Ever. Not even if you paid for my meal. If I wanted soup or anything like what they have, Panera Bread is down the street and Sweet Tomatoes isn't far from there either.  If you do go, just watch out for bugs!",

If you are in the mood for something on a cold day or something to just warm the soul I would highly suggest it. All the sandwiches are good but the salads get a bit old and they can sometimes run out of things that are suppose to go in your salad. For instance I ordered the chicken chop salad but they ran out of tomatoes. What is a salad without tomatoes?! nonetheless it was still good. If you don't mind a packed cafe restaurant with a lot of hustle and bustle but good food highly recommend this place. Oh and did I mention affordability; my meals are always under $15 and it is a very filling hearty meal. Usually take home leftovers! Only suggestion is that they are quicker at clearing off and cleaning tables. Since this place does get busy sometimes it s hard to find a table that has been cleaned.",

The portions are tiny and not very filling.  They have so many employees, it didn't seem efficient.  The portion scoops for your custom built salad yielded a serving size comparable to a teaspoon. When you ask for more they charge you or use another of your 6 inclusive toppings scoops. The prices were decent for the portions. Service wasn't memorable, which is to be expected at $10 a plate. Probly won't return, considering the all you can eat salad bar at sweet tomatoes is relatively commensurate as far as produce quality, yet boasts more options. The one vegan Soup was great, a little salty, but not unbearable. The wilted and soggy lettuce was a bit of a turn off, but too insignificant to warrant complaining. Over all not great for vegans, and would be estimated to be pretty good for meat eaters but no better than a panera or other salad bar in our opinion.",

One girl said it was 'kinda yellow'.  The other girl said 'we have balsamic dressing. That's brown'. Really?! Are you that dumb? I'm not a salad person, but some of their salads looked pretty intriguing. Their soups on the other hand, well although they are different, none of them looked appetizing at all. It's a shame because I was really in the mood for soup. Desserts were ok. Guess they forgot my chocolate-covered strawberries, and I was looking forward to those too. They get a star for the overly nice employees(even if they aren't the brightest bulb in the chandelier), and for their surprisingly soft ciabatta bread. My wife may want to come back.

Whoever they used for marketing screwed up.  Our office has ordered lunch a few times from the Eastern location and it was great in the beginning but the last salad did not seem fresh or flavorful.  Since I live near the new Lake Mead location, I was hoping to see if it might be better and would have loved to use the offer since it was a good one.

    "text": "Food is pretty good for a healthy lifestyle. However, they have become so popular that customer service is not important. The managers there cannot make any exceptions to satisfy the customer. For example, they ran out of the large soup cups and was providing 2 small cups to substitute. I did not appreciate this, however this happened for about a week and I grew accustomed to the change and decided I can save half for later in a smaller container which was good. I revisited the Las Vegas Location and they had received the large cups. I requested 2 small cups and even asked the manager who said they meet the request. I told her that I visited the location almost daily (close to my job) and she still insisted she could not even after I expressed the inconvenience they had put on us the customer with no complaints. Their take out rules vary depending on who you speak with. Also, once I asked for an extra chocolate covered strawberry instead of the bread (that I would only throw away) no give from the manager. Poor, poor customer service and managers!!!",

We got a good sized piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry complimentary . Everything was really fresh and good, the salads were a little dry that is really the only complaint. Staff very friendly and helpful.",

    "text": "Hmmmm. You stand in line to order: first the salad stuff even if you aren't getting a salad, then the soups (and order your sandwich) and then the desserts, oh, yes, and then you pay AND wait for your order. Water? Spoons? Napkins? in yet another area. Tables so close together that it's difficult to walk thru w/ a (very full) tray. Warning, spoiler: the CRAB in the crab sandwich is actually the imitation stuff (you know-Krab). The lobster in the two \"lobster\" soups? You guessed it. I think they may, however, wave a real lobster over the pot. The soup I got was tasty, but not hot enough. One of the other people in our group actually had her soup exchanged for something else because it was neither hot nor tasty. Thumbs up for the exchange. Each order comes with a strawberry dipped in chocolate. Howz 'bouts dumping the strawberry and work on the quality of the food. Problem areas include no area for wheel chairs or even someone on crutches, and, even scarier, a very small sign pretty much saying that you might have an allergy problem but it isn't their fault because they warned you there might be \"cross contamination\" of foods.",
