There's never really too long of a wait and we are always greeted with a warm smile. This place has only been improving in all aspects, especially all their renovations; it looks amazing inside now! All the meats are seasoned nicely and a big thing that they have me coming back for is their mashed potato, which may sound weird to since this is a place for meat, but their mashed potato has such a nice texture and taste to it that no other KBBQ in Las Vegas has replicated! I always end up ordering more mash because it's the side that I eat the most. I can't think of any negatives aside from hoping that all the employees are getting enough rest in between serving all the people that come to eat here. They've all been amazing and I hope they enjoy working here just as much as I enjoy eating here.",

    "text": "Went tonight for my wife's (she is from S. Korea) birthday as she was craving Korean BBQ.  We normally--in the past--have gone to Sura but decided to change it up for this occasion.  Well, we now know that we will NOT be going back EVER to this place!  I will say that the place had decent food...brisket was good and so was the pork bulgogi.  But, the banchan was just mediocre...and based on the review pics from the past it seems liked we didn't get the full selection of side dishes.    We got there around 6:00 PM and and we started to cook the AYCE \"Nevada\" BBQ (priced at $16.95/person) around 6:14 PM.  I only know this because I started to snap some pics of the group around that time on my iPhone.  Why did I check this a little later on, you ask?  Well, our server rudely wanted to turn off our grill around 7:15 PM and we told her we still wanted to eat a little more.  She then told us that the time limit was 1.5 hrs for the AYCE and we had only 10 more minutes.  Say what?  I was quite shocked as I have never been to a KBBQ that actually had a TIME LIMIT!!!  So, I checked my phone and saw that I snapped the first picture at 6:14 PM.  Which means we didn't have only 10 minutes left, but actually 30 minutes left when we were rudely advised.  Ironically, we were all getting stuffed anyway, and was ready to wrap up soon.  Now keep in mind, that some other tables who came in before us were STILL eating when we were told we had to wrap it up.  I guess they must have had \"cooler\" waitresses than ours.  I asked to speak to the manager and she smiled and listened, but you could tell she could have cared less (\"Oh yes, uh huh, ok, sorry....\").  She even told me--as I spoke in a normal voice complaining about how we were cheated out of a half hour in our \"timed\" 1 1/2 hr allotment (geez, that kills me to even have to mention that!)--that I needed to \"calm down\".  After, just standing there for several minutes with no offer to make us feel better or even a nice gesture in words, I said \"Thanks anyway...I guess you can go then\"...and she did!  So, be forewarned that depending on who your server is...and I guess if you don't fit the mold of True Koreans/Asians (I'm Korean-American, BTW)...you may be told to wrap it up and stop eating as your time may be up!  So, combined with lousy, slow service, you could be getting very little BBQ for what is supposed to be AYCE.  My advice to you is to go to Sura or another local AYCE Korean BBQ.  At least there you won't get horrible service and a ridiculous time allotment for eating.  If you don't heed my warning, then maybe you better bring a stopwatch to verify that you really are getting 1.5 hrs to eat their so-called \"AYCE\".",

I'm sure that was to ensure we didn't leave excessive leftovers that we would be charged for but not able to take home.

Three AYCE menus: Nevada ($16.95): Brisket, Pork Belly, Marinated Chicken, Spicy Chicken, Spicy Pork, Large Intestine, Steamed Egg, Bean Paste Soup, and House Salad. Vegas ($20.95): \"Nevada\" items plus Kalbi, Bulgogi, Spicy Squid, and Japchae. Spring Mountain ($24.95): \"Vegas\" items plus Beef Tongue, Dumpling, Shrimp, and Beef Tofu Soup.  We settled for the $20/person choice and ended up getting marinated meat, buldogi, and marinated chicken. Food was decent. Not the best I've had, but better than waiting 2 hours for the same thing in Tofu Hut.

We stood ther efor at least a minute or two before a woman, who was talking on a cell phone,  came out to seat us. Then she disappeared.   The decor is clean, not gritty dirty like some places, simple, and fairly spacious, with vent hoods over the tables and grills for cooking on the tables. Our waitress showed up with the charm of a woman going to see the IRS. She didn't smile and barely talked.   The 3 meat dishes we ordered were huge, with a lot of meat. The banchan (side dishes) were less than the good places I like, with only 6 instead of 8 varieties. The Kal Bi was flavorful, the Bulgogi tasty and the Chicken decent.   The total with a soda, tea and 1 beer, with tax and tip was $100, so not a bargain for lunch. I prefer Mother's Korean Grill a block away; it has a lot nicer decor, much better service, and the food is good. You don't have to go upstairs, either.",

Drinks kept filled, food came reasonably quick, and a well mannered waitress. We ordered the the all you can eat BBQ deal. As far as I'm concerned the meats were good and tastey, other restaurants of this kind may sometimes have more side dishes but I feel they are condiments and is not much of significant part of the review. From where I am from we don't have anything like this, but I go have Korean BBQ in Chicago and the prices we pay individually for one kind of meat is similar to the same price per person for this Korean buffet bqq so I don't see it as a relatively more expensive place.",

I had my suspicions about this place before I even walked through the door... The place was dead.  The place is very spacious, but there was just one other table and they were just wrapping up.  We should of left, but we really wanted bbq.    I'm not Korean, but I've had my fair share in Seattle.  We didn't get the All-You-Can-Eat, so maybe that's a better experience.  I doubt it though.  As others have said the food was bland or over seasoned.  We had japche, bulgogi, dolsot bibimbap, and soon du boo.  Everything tasted \"off\".    I'm sorry but this place was just awful.

Funny thing, she weighs less than 90 lbs, but eats everything in sight.  Yes, a walking garbage compactor... And, I love her still.... as long as she does not become Mrs Piggy times 10... :)  call me Kermit (yes, the green lovable fella).  Back to the review.  O.K.  This restaurant was a bit hard to find.  It is actually up on the second floor.  When you walk into the restaurant, it is very open, clean, and inviting.  It was a cool place.  I give Atmosphere a solid 4.  Service... well, let's say that our waitress started off strong.  Got us the water, the appetizers, and extras.  As the meal progressed, she kinda forgot about us.  We had to request more water, more food, and the check (we had to track her down).  I give this a 3.... should be lower, but she was sweet.  Now, for the food.  Well, for $19.99, you had all you can eat.  However, they provided you with the variety tray.  After you finish the variety tray, you can add more of the one's you like.  Personally, I do not like this.  There are just some items that we do not like to eat... instead of wasting them, we ended eating anyways.   I rather CHOOSE the selection.  Most Korean restaurant provides you with a buffet cart to pick from.  I was a bit sad to not see Galbee ribs.  They had boneless instead.  Trust me, one of the great joys of eating a Galbee rib is sucking on the bone.  Yes, a bit disgusting. sounds a bit \"gay\".  hey, I am married, I can say that without thinking otherwise...LOL... and, by the way, like the Seinfeld episode... nothing wrong with being gay... they just have a different preference... okay... moving on... the veggies and appetizers were good/average.  This was a solid 3.  Overall, the price was decent.  Food was very average.  And, Service was average.  As a result, a 3 sounds just about right!",

One thing I really appreciate is that they didn't automatically jump in and cook our food for us without asking, like some other places do. That's part of the fun, and we like to cook and eat at our own pace.   The decor and hip vibe were a surprising bonus!  The pork belly was tasty, and the beef short rib was an above average cut of meat.   The spicy squid and spicy baby octopus both came marinated in foil packets with veggies. They cooked slowly, evenly, and were tender and flavorful, instead of the charred rubber you end up with at other places. We seared them off *just* a little bit before nomming. The beef intestine was surprisingly good, and of the few times I've had it, it's the first time I've enjoyed eating it.  I'd recommend giving it a quick dunk in the spicy sauce from the squid/octopus before devouring because YUM.  All in all, a great experience! Thanks to other Yelpers for the reviews that brought us here. We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "A friend recommended coming here, but i've definitely had many better places.  First of all, the GIANT sign outside the door that advertises $16.95 for AYCE is for the most basic option only. The next option is $20.95 and $24.95.  Personally, there's not much options. They're all pretty basic compared to other restaurants.  It was extremely slow on a saturday evening. Doesn't seem like many people eat here, so there's no wait.  What did bother me was that with a whole place thats practically empty, they wanted to seat us next to a table with people. Like couldn't we have sat at least one extra table over so its not so crowded in one corner?  And we asked for more than one salad bowl because the guys eat ALOT of salad, but they refused and kept saying that their salad bowl is huge. So I guess they prefer making many multiple trips to give us salad refills.  Some of the meats are good. I did like the beef brisket, but it was a bit more on the fatty side cause it had a lot of fat. The bulgogi and angus rib finger were very similar. Soft texture but good marinade.   Pork belly is very thick and dry. Everything else was ok.  Potato salad is good. But was very sad that they don't have rice paper which is a staple for me when eating korean bbq.  I don't like their bbq grills either because they stick easier, and when fatty oils slide through, giant flames jump up from the table. And they get burnt faster too.  They did come by a few times to cut our meat for us. Thats about it.  And they automatically charged us 15% tip even though there was only three of us. So im assuming that they charge automatically charge you 15% tip for everyone, small or large groups.  Overall, I'd rather eat elsewhere. Plus they have no ventilation in there so it gets really hot.",

We get our first set of meat.... my husband asked for a fork since he doesn't know how to use chopsticks. 5 mins later still no fork and my husband is now using a spoon to eat his salad. After the first order of meat we were ready to order our second set of meat.... our waitress is catering to the other side of the restaurant. Mind you, this place was NOT busy. They decided to seat us far from the rest of the other guest. So about 15-20 mins of looking around to get someone's attention the lady who is currently on break decided to walk over and ask us, how can I help you?!?! So we ordered and received our meat and started cooking it.... 30 mins later our waiter walks over with our order not thinking we were already served. Wow so it would of taken like 45 mins to actually get our order if we ordered with our actual waitress. Finally, we are finished ordering and need led to get the bill. AGAIN our waitress busy assisting other guest but us. We waited 30 mins still no waitress in sight. So we got up and just paid without the bill. We didn't even wait for the ice cream because it probably would of been an hour before we got serviced. She's lucky she even got $5 out of me for tip.   I WILL NEVER EVER COME HERE AGAIN!",

I do not want to go into the sanitary and cleanliness of this restaurant due to Yelp rules but I will say that \"Dirty Dining\" should definitely investigate.   Honestly not a big fan of Korean BBQ but family wanted to eat here. It's a All You Can Eat BBQ. You pick 1 out of the 3 menus they have which is of course 3 different prices. We went with the Vegas menu which was about $20 per person. You get to choose the meats that is on that menu. We went with Bulgogi, spicy pork, spicy chicken, and the family had cow intestines. Yes, INTESTINES! you already know I did not touch that at all. We also got an order of shrimp for the kids that is not included in the Vegas menu so it was an extra $25. They bring out little small plates, kind of like appetizers in the beginning. There was fish cakes, spicy broccoli, kim chi, jalapenos, mashed potatoes, horse radish, house salad, and soup. When the meats come out, There is a stove on the table and you actually cook it yourself.   we had a few different waitresses assigned to our table because we were a party of 14. One of them pulled the table without acknowledging my phone was on there and dropped it. Good thing it didn't break or else I would have went crazy on her. Our drinks came after we got the food which was pretty unacceptable. I was thirsty! So we were eating spicy food without any waters for a good 10 minutes.   Never will come back & I do not recommend this place to anybody!",

The Radish KimChi and the Fish Paste Cake in the soy sauce with onions and jalapenos are amazing! *Make sure you put in your order of steamed egg first because it's take a while to cook. Remember to order rice paper also!* The rice paper is a good substitution to rice and you can make little wraps with the meat and sides.   My favorite meats are definitely the Chicken, bulgogi and the beef brisket. The intenstine takes very long to cook, we always have to ask the waitresses when they think it is ready because I never could tell. The waitresses (although speak in broken English) are always so friendly and are willing to help you cook on the grill. They are always fast and punctual when taking orders and delivering them.  I took my family of five here to celebrate a birthday and our bill including tip was under $100. I always leave this place happy, full and feeling like I got my money's worth.",

They all were very attentive and looked like they enjoyed their job. Michelle really stood out. She would come to our table often to cut our meat and cook it so that we could eat. She would make sure our grill was changed out if it became charred. Same with the other waiters.   I've been to other kbbq places but this is by far my favorite. Loving the modern and clean venue. Even the bathrooms were impressive which can't be said for many places in Chinatown.   If you came here to read about how good the food was we all ate AYCE VEGAS and it was yummy. 4/5 rating. Portions are family size so order a little at a time. $15 excess food charge.",

I thought she left and went to get the tongs. But she never did. I had to ask another server to get one for us.   Second, there were six of us but they said we can only order 4 kinds of meat at a time... so, ok.... we grubbed and finished the food, no one even checked with us if we needed anything, or refill our water, or even ask if we want to order anything else.. but ofcourse we do. I hate waving at the servers to come to our table but it was too much, they just kept passing by our table even if they saw our table with no more meat/food.  Third, I ordered with this server, i asked her for five items, she didn't write them down, ok..i thought maybe she has a sharp memory... 15 mins later, she only brought one item that I asked and the others were forgotten. I had to ask another server for it. And ofcourse we had to wait again.   I have been here before, but it wasn't this bad service wise. The food were good but the serving is small considering there were 6 of us at the table. Small variety of banchan too! Not even fishcakes!! ='(   Honestly, that was my first time leaving an ayce restaurant still hungry. Although we wanted to stay and eat more, we just lost our appetite because of their service.",

Also, they have pretty good side dishes, but in particular, I didn't like the broccoli that they made. In the end, it's all a pretty good price for what they give you, but those are the best items, in my opinion.   Service was good for me. There wasn't a long line or a ton of people eating here. It was very private and bright inside. Plus, they have a great window view of..Chinatown haha! I feel like they did make our grill way too hot. It was burning my face and my food and I had to ask them to turn it down!   I'd probably come here again because it's cheap and good, plus there are no extremely long lines! Next time, I'm just gonna turn the grill down and keep that brisket comin'!!!!",

I like their brisket, baby octopus and pork belly. 3 times we ordered the meat dishes we always have at least 1 item missing despite we waited for a long time. Marinated meat seems too sweet to me. House salad's dressing was way sweet as well makes the salad less appetite. Service was friendly. Fast but just needs to check on customer regularly.",

    "text": "Came here with my parents on whim.  There are so many restaurants to choose from on this street, we basically pointed and was like \"that one.\"  We were not disappointed.  This place is upstairs next to a massage parlor.  I can see parking being a little difficult because there were limited spaces, and tons or places to eat in this strip mall, but we didn't have any problems.  Also, if you read the signs its only one hour customer parking.  I was there longer and didn't get towed, but could be different another time.  Upon entering there were only two other tables being used.  I thought there would be more considering we came in on a Wednesday night around 8pm.  My parents were new to the Korean BBQ Buffet, and the host was very informative on how it works, but at the table they have a bunch of fine print to read.  They only allow two or more people to do the buffet.  Also, you have a 90 minute time limit to order once you have put the first order in- so you cannot sit there all day.  Also, of the two buffet choices, everyone has to choose either one or the other TOGETHER.  Any leftover food can be charged to you, so finish everything.  Now, once the food is out, you can ask them to take some back.  But if it sits at the side of your table, its yours.  We all opted for the $20.00 buffet choices.  There was another one at $24.00 with a couple more options, as well as a A La Carte option. To start, we ordered the chicken, short ribs, Bulgogi, and the Brisket.  They came out with the food rather quickly since nobody else was there, and we began cooking.  We immediately asked them to take back some of the Bulgogi since its looked overwhelming.  But this was not the case- throughout the night, we kept ordering small batches of Bulgogi.  It looks intimidating, but its not once you cook it.  The food was really good, and the service good too, they would sometimes come by to cook and cut meats up at our table.  My only gripe was that it did get a little busy out of nowhere, like 8 more tables showed up.  During this time we asked for more meats, and it took them about 15 minutes to get the meats to us.  They also swapped the grills which is a nice touch too.  There were no issues with the bill, and they automatically put in tip depending on if your party is 5 or less, 6 or more.  I will return here, but maybe not for a while, there are so many places to choose from on this street- I want to try them all.  But this place is a recommend!",

Yum, my fav! but if you eat KBBQ as often as I do,  1. Head over to Greenland (Korean supermarket)  2. Buy a grill & stove & gas  3. Meats to eat (Brisket is like $8 a pack - good for two) 4. Make your own sides  Overall initial cost for all items = $50, just refill the meats for next time! & enjoy KBBQ at the comfort of your home. Instant food coma, no sleepy driving pre-caution.",

My sister and her husband, who met us in LV from Honolulu are no strangers to AYCE Korean BBQ--but we were all impressed by the fast, friendly service and the quality of the food.  Since it was our first time here, we asked questions about the menu and the process and our waiter was very patient and NICE.  For those of you who have frequented ethnic eateries, you know that on occasion you are forced to deal with wait staff who seriously lack customer service--they run the gamut of indifferent to brusque impatience to downright rude (muttering in their own language within earshot of customers who may or may not be capable of understanding!).  So naturally we were a little hesitant about being \"newbies\" and asking questions,but we were pleasantly surprised to find our questions met with smiles and polite answers and even quicker service!  The banchan were delicious, the kalbi, bulgogi and spicy pork were even more so.  The salad was a little plain, but the dressing was nice and we left nary a leaf uneaten.  The price was extremely reasonable considering we were stuffed and sleepy by meal's end.  Highly recommended for the food and the staff.",

But during lunch, they don't serve all of the little side dishes that are usually served before the meat. No kimchi for lunch? Seriously? And gratuity is ridiculous. Besides those cons, the meat's pretty good and the service is good too.",

    "text": "I've been here several times with large groups after a late night on the strip. It's alright but I must admit that I've never felt particularly satisfied here.   We'll start with the good: It's open late-- likely to appeal to all the partiers with drunk munchies from nearby XS and Tryst. They've got a nice large banquet room for large parties that was just perfect for us.  And I dare say it does strike me as pretty authentic. They even give you a raw egg to crack over your boiling hot soup which is served in traditional korean style bowls.  However, the good things just don't make up for the rest of the experience, which is mediocre at best. The service during our last trip here was pretty unremarkable-- maybe they were just having a rough night but it certainly wasn't appreciated by us. The soup is not bad but I have had better in california. The quality of the ingredients just didn't seem that impressive to me. And the meat is certainly my biggest complaint of all. The kalbi is ok but not particularly juicy or flavorful, and it is certainly overpriced. All the good stuff on the menu is a bit overpriced and you don't really get that much. I have had much better in korean restaurants in California.  The bottom line is that you don't have to deal with the shortcomings of this place because there are many other better options for your dollar--even on Spring Mountain.",

What happened to smiling and greeting your customers? I automatically thought this was going to be a horrible lunch.   When we saw the menu, I noticed almost everything was overpriced for the amount that they only give you. Don't be fooled of how the pictures look! Expect little.  We asked the lady 5 times for SIX forks. After the second time we asked, she finally gave us THREE. Then we had to ask her another few times to finally give us the last three. Ridiculous. When we ordered our soups, there was no bowls, no serving spoon. What do you expect us to do? Share from the same bowl?  We then later asked our server to take a picture of us. She grunted and said \"I'm so busy\" [there was barely anyone there] but she ended up taking the pictures anyways ---- Then she dropped my boyfriend's phone and didn't even bother picking it up.   DON'T GO HERE. We wish we saw the yelp reviews before we checked this place out. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.",

    "text": "I was wondering why this place was nearly empty, but not for long.  Their AYCE menu is split up into three categories. Nevada (~$15.99) has the basics of KBBQ: beef brisket, pork belly, marinated chicken, and a few other meats. Vegas (~$19.99) and the last option (~$23.99) offer more protein goodness like beef tongue, spicy marinated meats, and large intestine. You can't go wrong with any of them, really. It's meat.   Kimchi, sliced fish cakes, bean sprouts, broccoli, marinated jalapenos, and potato salad make up their banchan. Pretty standard quality and flavor. Wish that I got to try their steamed egg though. They don't have rice paper, so you can either chow down on salad or order rice.  Service was inconsistent considering that my coworkers and I were some of the few diners that evening. They would bring the meats and banchan out quickly, but didn't respond to our repeated requests for water. I know we're in the desert and all, but should we really have to ask several times? Even when the water pitcher was finally brought over, the eight of us drained it before the ice had a chance to melt.  Despite being able to hear our voices echo in the sheer emptiness, our simple requests went unheard. Their food is decent, but can't make up for the poor service.",

However, I love their salad; perfect balance of lettuce and dressing. Their steamed egg is also satisfactory, not too salty which is great.

From what I was told by one of the servers, they remodeled the entire restaurant about 3 months ago from today (1/2/2017). The interior became more modern and they've added some new decor. A nice upgrade from before.  Service has never been a problem here and the staff are always attentive. They will keep coming back to your table to ask if you need anything else or to see if the grill needs to be changed. However, this restaurant does get busy and they may miss your table at times when helping other customers, but no biggie.  Compared to other K-BBQ restaurants in Vegas, I prefer their All You Can Eat (AYCE). I base it off the quality, cleanliness, and selection. There are 2 different AYCE prices to choose from. You can either choose the \"Spring Mountain\" menu or the \"Vegas\" menu. There used to be a menu selection called the Nevada, but their menus have changed since they've remodeled.  The Spring Mountain one has a lil bit more items to choose from for just $4 more per person. It would be the better choice. ;] Especially if you like more meat options, seafood, and other miscellaneous food items.  If you're craving for some Korean BBQ, but aren't sure which one to eat at, give this place a try! It's been around for years for a reason. :]",

There was a gentlemen who was visibly upset about a bill split, while the other lady who was serving us was not only helpful but frequent in checking in on us.   Their bulgogi was off the chain, their Honey Garlic shrimp definitely was too however I wish they served them in larger portions. I don't know what they marinate their bulgogi in but I might sell my soul for the recipe. I didn't personally care too much for the sides, but some of the other party members were. I do wish they were more accommodating to one of our party members who was a vegetarian and just wanted to spend time with us. They basically charged her $24 for some noodles. That was a little unfair an exception couldn't be made.  I hear there are better places in the area and I'd like to try them out, but for my first place in Las Vegas for Korean BBQ... not bad.",

I really liked the new decor, and it makes you feel super comfortable there.  I had never had Korean BBQ before coming to this restaurant and honestly no other has been as good as this place. The food is really good, the prices are very affordable, but the best part is how friendly and kind the staff is. Not only they're always on the lookout to bring you second helpings of the side dishes, but the friendly conversation that springs up sometimes makes you feel super comfortable.  I'm sure there are plenty of options for BBQs in the area but I was really charmed by Korean Garden and I'm definitely building up an appetite for when I drop by again, hopefully soon!",

Let me start off by saying that their atmosphere is amazing, I love their decor and their vibe that they have going on. Usually when we go out for KBBQ, we order brisket; so we did the same while we were here. Their brisket was a little different than what were used to, but nonetheless it was delicious. My favorite was their seasoned pork belly! TOTAL game changer. That was the first time I've had pork belly that was actually delicious right off the grill W/O any dipping sauces!   We also loved how their menu incorporated different side items! They happened to have my favorite Korean stew, kimchi jji gae, and it was soooo yummy! Even my husband (who usually strays from spicy food) enjoyed it! Their steamed egg was also delicious!   Definitely going to check this place out again whenever we're in Vegas!",

The waiter then put us on a large group size table, bigger than my current group which was a first for me at KBBQ. I loved the big table and all its space! Witht that the place itself was very spacious and easy on the eyes. It was a very welcoming renovation. Service was fine too. Not a lot of wait staff due to the low customer count. Our waiter helped us with a few things, such as cooking some meats for us and helping us decide what was good on the menu. All in all, what a nice guy! The food was fine. I've always felt that KBBQ meat has similar tastes between places, only minute texture differences that can actually make something stand out in different places. As for KG, eh it was fine. AYCE price and selection was standard, though I felt that the more expensive dinner selection, the Spring Mtn. Package, was perhaps lacking. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other places though.",

They were hesitant to give us two grills with one person missing because they said we can only use two grills if we had more than 6 people. They ended up giving us the two grills but didn't take our drink order until 20-25 minutes after we sat down even though it wasn't busy. The servers looked angry and seemed annoyed every time we wanted to order something. They kept asking us if the last person in our party was coming and only after we started eating did they tell us there was a time limit. Our friend ended up not being able to come due to an appointment that ran late and when we told them that, they still wanted to charge us for 7 people because we should have only had one grill and \"people were waiting.\" We tried to explain our situation to the server but she kept arguing with us and even walked away as my friend was in the middle of talking. They ended up not charging us for the 7th person but charged us 20% gratuity. As we walked out, the next party waiting only had 6 people in it so they weren't really waiting for our table.  Overall they were really unprofessional and rude so I am not coming back.",

We were lucky to get in to this place and my husband was looking for all you can eat Korean BBQ. We ordered the expensive option for $23.99. They have some rules so you'd better check them out before you ordered food. Each plate of meat was huge. Do not over order then you will get charge $15 for that. You also need to finish in 90 mins but in such a busy time where food came out late they still let you eat. There were tables that came before us and left after us. Servers were nice and always smiled. The meat tasted good. We enjoyed a lot. We will come back again.  I also loved the side dishes and sauces that they gave us.",

There wasn't a lot of guests, but the servers still took a long time to come take our orders and would forget to bring us our food items. We had to order two or more times for them to actually bring it out!   The price also includes tips no matter what. It included gratuity if you are one person or more. I get that tipping is courtesy, but I don't want to tip if the service is disappointing. There's also a bunch of silly rules like having to order 4 items at a time only. Like they would even able to bring those items out in time.   We also got reprimanded for ordering more than the initial 4 items. We were a group of 5 hungry people, we came to AYCE for a reason.   Though the brisket (#1) was REALLY good, there was a limited amount of appetizers, lacking dessert options, and bad service. The total came to $30, but for that price you can get a great AYCE experience from Hwaro, Gen, or Tofu Hut down the street. It's definitely NOT worth it.",

This was my 3rd time coming to this restaurant because I enjoyed it here the first couple times, but this is most definitely my 3rd and final time. Today is my mother's birthday & we wanted to take her to a nice dinner that she would enjoy. We chose Korean Garden BBQ. Everything was okay, even though we were being served by a waitress who had a horrible attitude and no personality whatsoever. About an hour into the meal, our extremely rude waitress asked us if we would like our stove turned off IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR MEAL. We clearly were not done, we had a party of 8 people, we weren't even an hour into our apparent \"all you can eat meal\". After we informed her that we wanted more meat, she said that we had a time limit and we would not be given anymore food when we STILL had over 30 minutes left. After taking a look around the restaurant, we had seen other parties that had been there just as long as us, IF NOT LONGER, and they were not told that they had to hurry their meal up. You know what this is called in this day and age ? RACISM, as we were the only white individuals in this restaurant. After we made a complaint to the so called \"manager\", our extremely rude waitress came out and said \"Sorry because the customer is always right\" about 8 times in a row. An apology means nothing if it is completely staged and not genuine whatsoever. Terrible, overall terrible restaurant. If you want all you can eat, go to Tofu hut down the street, or just go down to LA And get QUALITY korean BBQ there.",

The green salad could use less dressing (ask for it on the side). The side appetizers are always coming, and the fact that you are cooking it to your liking isn't too bad either. The portions of the meats are pretty big so choose carefully, I don't suggest getting chicken, because chicken on a BBQ should only be cooked for chicken, but other than that, this is the place to go whether your'e a local or a tourist.",

I mean the food and meat was okay but I asked for salad three times and they still never brought it by the time I was done eating. I also asked for rice and kimchi TWICE and when I would ask if it was coming they would roll their eyes (it never came anyway). Every time we asked for something they would write it down and say okay but then they would never come with it??? I think it ridiculous to have to ask for everything 2-3 times when it's not even busy. I'm never coming here again. It was a terrible experience.",

We asked if there was a non-all you can eat menu and we weren't given one either. So I had just ordered some bulgogi. A regular order and a water. Finally it was time to pay. My friends had gotten the all you can eat and their totals came out to around $28.00. However, my single plate of bulgogi came out to $38.00. Why did I have to pay extra for one thing when I could have just payed less for multiple servings of bulgogi. Personally I would not go again simply because of their prices and not having a menu with prices for single servings. However, the bulgogi was great. $38.00 great? Not so much.",

    "text": "have you ever visited Korea or gone to a very traditional Korean restaurant that is run by Koreans with Korean servers?  If you have, you are well aware that their service isn't all about smiles and chatting, but one of diligence and speed.  Some reviewers before me complained about the service being awful, but I assume they aren't used to the way things are run in places like this.  It may not be an excuse, but as long as I get my drink refills and food on time and they pass by and glance at our table to ensure that we are constantly well kept, I don't care if Chung Li smiles at me or not.  If they do their job well, I'm happy.  With that off my shoulders, let's get to the juicy review!  This is the sister restaurant of Maru in Summerlin, and I have to say that I prefer this place over Maru any day of the year.  We discovered this place on a whim after trying the restaurant below this one (it was horrid). We walked in and there's a faux well in the dining area and everything is clean and well kept.  That's always a good sign.  They seat you or you tell them where you want to be seated, you get the menu and begin the experience.  They have a variety of traditional Korean dishes, and with the Korean patrons eating there when we first arrived I knew this would be good.  We ordered our typical dishes--bulgogi and kalbi, shrimp tempura appetizer to start.  We asked that they cook it in the back, and they did.  Our tempura was out on our table within five minutes along with the usual side dishes.  I personally love the picked radish and croquette.  Their rokio is good, too, although not the typical white pearl onion version.  Our food arrived promptly, and we waited no more than ten minutes (if that) for the food.  It was good.  I mean really, really good.  When the waitress brought out the salad and then--wait for it.....the radish beef soup,. i wanted to cry.  Let me explain my need for this soup.  When I was five years old my parents took me to a Korean BBQ restaurant back home.  They served this awesome clear broth soup with what I assumed was thinly sliced potatoes and maybe a touch or two of beef.  As simple as it sounds, it's a traditional soup appetizer to have with a Korean meal, and I've eaten it every time I had BBQ out at a restaurant.  For two and a half years we searched Korean BBQ places in Las Vegas for this appetizer, and for some reason none of them serve it.  Finally, after 2.5 years of searching, when the girl brought the soup out in its traditional low-rimmed bowl and I had to use the typical long-stemmed spoon to eat it, i teared up.  My childhood wafting in my face with the smells of radish and beef broth.  It was a great moment.  The soup is simple and contains nothing but clear brother flavored by the radish and beef, with thin slices of radish and one or two pieces of shredded beef in the bowl.  It's simply yummy.  After eating two bowls of it along with the great BBQ and appetizer, I was stuffed and thoroughly happy. I craved the BBQ daily for a week and satisfied my craving for dinner that week.  I never get sick of bulgogi and kalbi.    When I finally cooked it at our table one night I decided that was the way to go from now on because I could burn my bulgogi a bit more than the cooks in the back would to get that sweeter flavor.  If you ever go to a Korean bbq place, cook it yourself.  It's fun and tasty!  Overall, a great experience, and my only BBQ place where they serve my childhood soup.  I'm looking forward to more of their food again next week, and the week after, and the week after that.  I know that I sing high praises over the soup and the food, but it honestly is that good and is the only spot we will eat Korean food from now on.",

There are three different prices to choose from it all depends on which meat you want. We chose the $20 per person option which had a better selection of meat than the $16 option. Banchan and salad were both pretty good and they serve their japchae warm. The meats were tender and pretty good quality. As popular as Korean food is becoming it was not packed in here and they had ample seating. The biggest con about this place is the busy strip mall and limited parking. With neighborhood business such as tea station and Cafe noodle this parking lot tends to be packed with limited parking which is the main downfall. If you don't mind that or taking an extra walk by parking in the lot next door this place is worth the visit if you're a Korean BBQ connoisseur like myself.",

I would go here every week with a friend and without a doubt it was my favorite place and it was awesome. However They recently got rid of the a la carte.   Let's be honest, korean bbq is expensive and it's hard to find a good place. When I USED to go I would order the beef brisket and split it with my friend and this was enough for the both of us. This would allow a fair price with plenty of food. We ordered the same thing everytime and it never got old. It was our go to for korean bbq! However they got rid of this option and you can no longer just buy the entree as they force you to get the \"all you can eat\" which is significantly more expensive. If I frequently go to lunch I don't want to spend $20+!  If you ignore the price, the food was awesome. I won't lie, the beef brisket is probably the best I've tried. However, my last visit left a bad taste in my mouth as the waitress was rude to us. I typically don't let staff influence my decision as we all have bad days but this ridiculous pricing and getting rid of the a la carte is enough to make me not want to go back.",

    "text": "3.5 stars really.  Initially I meant to go to Tofu Hut, however I was not going to wait an hour for it. Hunting on Yelp, I discovered Korean Garden BBQ House. What interested me were their pricings:   They have 3 different pricings: Nevada $14-15.99, Las Vegas $19.99, and Spring Mtn $22-23.99. Nevada having the shortest list of items to Spring Mtn having the longest list of items - depending on which pricing you choose, you may choose as many items on that list to your liking.  I chose the Las Vegas pricing (Nevada pricing does not offer Japchae or Bulgogi.) I ordered Japchae, Marinated Chicken, Bulgogi, and Pork Belly. Second Round something Rib Fingers, Bulgogi, Beef Brisket, and something item that slipped my mind. The portions of meat were huge considering two types of meat were on one plate.   The service was meh (staff forgot a couple of items we asked for) which doesn't help when the menu states - parties of 5 OR LESS 15% gratuity is already included -_- poop. I guess you can't complain(maybe you can) because the staff does cook and cut the meat for you.   Like what other YELPers say - staff in the beginning are attentive and helpful, however later on... they just aren't haha. The bill took a while to arrive that I ended up walking up to the counter and paying - bout $50 for my meal.   You may not make this mistake (I did) so just a note, do the math for the pricing you choose - add tax(8.1%) and 15% gratuity to make sure you actually want to pay $xx.xx for this meal (since now you can't choose how much gratuity to give but can choose what pricing you'd like)  I could have lived without the Japchae and if I could, would have left just 10% to 13% gratuity.",

For $16/person + tax and tip, this is one of the cheaper places to go to if you want AYCE KBBQ.   I have been to Korean Garden a couple of times with my friends. My experiences with them were pretty pleasant so I decided to take my family here. Worst decision ever.   Given the fact that the service here is already terrible, the staffs are not one bit nice about it at all. Here's what really ticked me off:   1) They bring the meat to the table but they take forever to come back to put it on the grill. (Trust me, I would love to do the cooking myself but I got called out before for touching the tongs/scissors). They need an excuse for that gratuity.  2) They automatically get gratuity because it's their house rule. I get it that they cook the food/cut the meats on the grill but most of the time they are not around to do it anyway. They probably know that if they leave it to the customers to tip they would get 0 tip because of how bad their service is.   3) The time limit of 1 hour and 30 minutes is not enough because I spent 45+ minutes of that time, waiting. I was not able to enjoy my meal because they were so slow that I practically just waited all that time. Waiting for the meat, waiting for the drinks, waiting for the bill, etc.   I probably would not be back anymore. I would rather shell out a few more dollars in a nicer spot where they actually care for their customers rather than be given mediocre food and bad service. My suggestion would be, go here off peak hours - maybe the service would be better.",

    "text": "My cousin took me here last weekend to break my AYCE Korean BBQ virginity, and I was really, really happy she did. I really enjoyed having my dinner here, especially since the price is super affordable. I believe the start price for the Nevada menu is $16!   The brisket was fantastic. The bulgogi was delicious. And the spicy chicken was amaze-balls! I really enjoyed their side dishes too. Service was okay. The owners were there and they were really nice and hospitable! When your grill gets dirty, they replace it for you. Everything was near perfect.  The only reason why I didn't give it a full-on five star review was because the service was slow.. They didn't give us rice, tongs, and our grill was too hot. Not to mention we constantly asked for our water re-fills. So their service was what deducted a star from this review. Also, when I got up to pay at the cashier, the guy rudely looked at me and said, \"Umm.. This doesn't include tip.\" -___- Like seriously? I know. I can read. And you shouldn't ASK for tip from your customers..   Other than that rude guy server and the mishaps of the night, I still would eat at this place. The owners were kind and the food was delicious!  I MUST ADD: You can't get AYCE KBBQ unless there's two of you. Bummer, I know.",

We came in pretty late and they were totally great. By the end of our experience, we were the only people there. I was watching the TV inside because they were playing a BTS concert (im a HUGE fan ), and the worker offered to play their music on the speakers throughout the restaurant. It made me really happy, and although my family was confused about why I got so hyped, it was awesome.  Thanks to all the staff, and especially the guy who played BTS for me! Great place I would totally recommend. Definitely will be back here soon.",

We chose the $23.95 option that came with more seafood. The meat here is fresh, but the seafood was very subpar. I am not a seafood person, so it was not a big deal for me. The soups and stews here were also meh, but again, not a big deal for me.   They have this oil and salt mixture that I cannot find at other KBBQ places. It's amazing, and complements the meats so well. Honestly, it might be the reason why this review is getting five-stars.   The KBBQ place down the street cannot compare in meat quality with KG BBQ.   Definitely coming again during my next visit to LV!! Can't wait.",

    "text": "The low star reviews aren't warranted.   People complaining that the waiters take forever to put food on the grill? What universe are we in? You cook your own food at ayce kbbq!   People complaining about a 15% autograt? 15% is pretty low! Were you planning on not tipping?   90 minute limit to eat? Welcome to every AYCE ever, including Stations Casinos  (2hr limit.)  There's no ventilation? There's a vent hood above every grill table!  Honestly, these other reviewers are on some heavy nonsense.   Went here on 9/9/16 (Friday night around 8:45 pm) after having a 90 min + wait at Tofu Hut, Magal, Gen etc. I called Korean Garden and asked what their wait time was. It was no wait and starts at $16.95 for dinner. I was sold.  Walked in. Pretty basic looking, looks decent. While the menu is smaller than other places, I thought it was great that the cheapest option doesn't include seafood. We don't eat seafood, so why pay extra for dishes we weren't going to order anyway? Anywhere we go, we get brisket, pork belly and whatever is available that is marinated. Bulgogi is on the $20 menu, so we stuck with marinated pork. We also got steamed eggs which came out fast!  Service was fine. They kept the food coming and changed the grills out quickly, without us asking. At more expensive places, we've asked for various items multiple times, with the waiters forgetting. We didn't experience that at Korean Garden.   Ignore the garbage reviews, this place is fine and the lack of a wait takes it over  the top.",

The speed of service was slow because there was only 1 server at the time and there were 5 groups of people eating including my small group of 3 people. My main issue is that when I received the bill the waitress had handwritten the tip amount and total on the bottom of the receipt. I then gave my credit card to the waitress to pay the bill and the receipt that was given back to me had already charged my credit card the tip amount that the waitress had handwritten in before I had signed the receipt. I do not understand why they had already charged my credit card for the tip before I had actually written in the tip amount and signed. I had planned to leave cash as a tip and they took that option away from me. It was not even written anywhere on the receipt that tip was mandatory. Not to mention the slow service. This just felt so shady like they were trying to cover up for the quality of service with mandatory tipping. I will never eat here again!!",

Or they'll be \"too busy\" to check up on the tables. Which definitely gets annoying. The food is the typical korean bbq that you can find anywhere else. They don't really have a dish that stands out, to be completely honest. Their japchae is good, but personally, nothing can compare to Hobak's japchae. There's two different menus, the cheaper Vegas menu, and the more expensive Spring Mountain menu. Although the Spring Mountain definitely has more options for the bbq, I don't think it's worth the extra dollars. Their bulgogi is so-so, as well. I do enjoy their pork neck (included in the Vegas menu) and the steamed egg, but it's not something I would go out of my way to get.",

The problem lies with a big party I guess.. we had a party of 14 so the waitress seemed annoyed or overwhelmed I should say at the least!  2 small grills and a 1 hour time limit to feed 14 people wasn't ideal! Some of the party didn't get to order what they wanted off the menu since our time was up after getting the first 3 meats off the menu and waiting for them to cook... most likely I won't visit again but it was okay I guess.. we split the check and I had 5 in my family with 2 drinks and the buffet for myself, girl and 3 children the total was $180 with tip! For that amount of money I wasn't satisfied at all... also the service was mediocre..  maybe it would be better if it was just my family but like I said we had a large party that night...",

Didn't let us know when is the last order. While we are enjoying \"all you can eat\", the staff there just keep letting us has a limited order only of four item and can not order any others before we finish the first four items.  Bad taste and unclean food! Meats are too normal to worth the price. We even found inset in our vegetable salad. Terrible!  Ignored and unrespectful service!At the checkout time, The server toughly wrote the certain \"high \"tip price on your bill without asking for your opinion, even if their service radically is not worth! Oh my goodness! At last, we don't accept their behaviors and refuse to sign name on the bill.but they don't let us go!!! Said that was their policy! And force us to sign name pay.If we were not rushing elsewhere, we definitely will call the police! Unbelievable such things could happen in the USA!  I sincerely swear right here. All I mentioned above are absolute truth. Eating at this Korean Garden BBQ is bad for your health, bad for your mood, wasting your time and money!!!",

    "text": "This is probably my 4th time coming here, but first time coming here since they renovated. The newly renovated restaurant is nice. New decor, mainly. They did change their menu as well, new prices. Went up a couple dollars, since the old menu.   There is two sides to the menu, Vegas Package $19.95 and Spring Mt. Package $23.95. If you come with a group be prepared to have everyone agree on the same package. They will not let you choose separate packages.   The reason for three stars, is because their food is good and they give good amount of meat and sides. Unfortunately, their service isn't very consistent. Our server was nice, but she seem to be more attentive to the front part of the restaurant than our side. We were in the back corner.  We had to ask for our steamed egg a couple times, something we ordered when we first sat down. Maybe it wasn't her, could have been the cook in the back. But she never really came by to check on us much. She would come by to turn down our grill but we wouldn't even have time to ask her for a refill for our drinks, she would just walk away.   Another lady came by and cooked for us. Which was nice, but she did take the tongs out of my fiance hands unexpectedly...which was a bit rude, didn't even ask for it nicely . They also never really came by to fill up our water or tea until we waved them down. We were checked on very Little. The restaurant wasn't really busy when we were there,  until we left. It was just a little disappointing when you see other guest getting better service than your own table.  Food was good, portion size great, but service needs a little work.",

    "text": "I was w/ my Korean mother-in-law, looking to try this newly opened Korean restaurant. She heard from a friend that the place served a pretty good lunch special... she begged to differ. I know she sets the bar pretty high when it comes to Korean comfort food, she's been cooking it all her life for her family and her restaurant. So with that in mind... she was not a happy camper. There was a lot more misses than hits and I agreed... it was just subpar.   Service: was subpar. We repeatedly asked our waters to be filled. I would understand if they were busy, but the restaurant was barely half-filled. When we asked for a little more banchan, Mr. Server only came back with a small plate of kimchii. =/   Food: was just okay. We ordered several lunch specials. Portions were smaller than what we had anticipated although the presentation was pretty. (See pix)  Prices: pricey. Korean food is not cheap by any means. Since prepping includes washing and rinsing and chopping and mixing and rinsing summo and squeezing... I know the drill. I've served as a prep-er under  my kimchii-mama-in-law's direction. So the amount of work that goes in every dish is crucial to making an delectable meal. The quality at Korean Garden BBQ house is lacking luster, lacking flavor, and lacking overall yumminess. I didn't see how much lunch racked up to be, but I suppose it didn't add up to the kind of lunch she didn't think was worth paying for what she did. She was saying a whole bunch of Korean words about the place I didn't understand that didn't seem forthcoming at all.   Overall we have experienced better and it's one of those \"first and last\" categories we shall place this under.",

They are either dumb or careless (because their price for AYCE is not bad), they will ask you to order the food and they will never give you help \"how to order\", and they have no slightest idea how long it's going to take them to bring the food you order to your table.  So when our party of 5 ordered beef, it took them 20 minutes, to bring us a plate of beef, and the portion was only good for one person! We asked didn't you see there are five of us? They smiled and said, you can always order more! OK.... And the next thing we find out is, you'll have to wait before you can order more, because there are tables waiting to make the first orders.  They don't seem to have enough waiters and meat slicer/ operators, at all.  All tables are complaining, none of us would consider to come back.  The taste of the food? Two items are good for me: steamed egg- I love it, I ordered it twice. The beef is pretty good to. However I would not pay $30, to have steamed egg and beef slices,  with extremely slow and chaotic, careless service.  The worst part is: they all think they're doing the right thing, there was no apology, at all, needless to say any sign of future improvement.   PS,  I am just finishing the review, from my experience a few months back. I haven't been back since. They might have improved or changed hand. Please pay more attention to the more recent visitors' reviews. I'm just finishing what I started. :-)  No More procrastination, yay! :-)",

After a long day of errands, having a preggo appetite...I was seriously looking forward to getting my Korean BBQ fix. But LAST NIGHT (Aug 20), I was so disappointed. The moment we sat down, the server handed us the regular menu (weird where the hell is the AYCE MENU?!) I let her know we wanted to do AYCE and she said...IN EXACT WORDS: \"we are NOT having AYCE today because there was a convention.\" And I replied \"meaning...?\" And she said \"I will get some water.\"   Ok...let me get this straight, no AYCE because there was a convention so therefore the amount of traffic the restaurant received is not \"normal\" and could potentially rip off the business due to the amount of people who will be eating AYCE. Am I correct? OR...they simply didn't expect that amount of foot traffic and didn't have enough meat for AYCE. Either reason, they had made a BAD business decision. Consistency? That died along with it last night.  To make it more obviously embarrassing, the servers switched and I asked the new server if AYCE really isn't available and he said \"yes but I think tomorrow we will have it.\" I replied and told him we would eat somewhere else and left with an empty stomach, hungry unborn baby and disappointed.",

The portions was good however, their meat was very very dry. The worst part of this experience was that when the waiter was cooking the pork belly, a bug fell on to the table, VERY VERY close to our food... Honestly, that scared the crap out of us and our appetite immediately died.  The waiter did nothing, absolutely NOTHING about it. She just picked it up and continued her routine. She didn't even bother to switch the meat in case of any form of contamination or bacterial infection that could have been caused. She also told us to \"not worry\" HOW CAN WE NOT WORRY.  Also, when we were finished, she didn't even have the audacity to give us the check. Most places would give it to you that way service would be quick and accurate. However they did not.  The food here is mediocre, the service is below average. Compared to close competition such as Sura, DJK and Tofu Hut this place is nothing worth trying.",

Well, when they shut down in February due to a fire we needed somewhere else to go! Korean Gardens was close by so we decided to try it out. Not only are their prices incredibly cheaper for what I believe to be even better tasting food, but their entire staff is nothing but fantastic (especially Angie)! Granted, we now frequent this location WEEKLY...but they always greet us so warmly and even after the first few visits knew what drinks and specific meats to bring to the table without even asking. The food is amazing and so worth it. Love love love!",

Our waitress was very nice and came to tend to us so very often.   At first I thought we were allowed to choose a couple of side dishes out of the 9 offered in the menu so we ordered the bulgogi and shrimp just in case 1 order wouldn't be enough for the 3 of us. To our surprise, our orders came with all 9 side dishes, radish soup, 2 bowls of rice AND dessert. Contrary to how the korean bbq restaurant's run in Hong Kong (where we used to live, we'd cook the raw meat ourselves), the waitress here cooked our food for us and alerted us when the food was ready to eat. We were stuffed.   Of course, for comparison's sake, we might go around and try another korean bbq restaurant nearby called Yagyu soon where I could change my mind - and my rating :P",

The food was great; I definitely prefer their sides to Tofu Huts, though I still like Honey  Pig's Kim chi and pickles better. I did miss beef tongue, which they do not seem to have. Sad face.   It may be due to where our table was; directly along the wait staff's path to the kitchen, or due to the fact that we ate pretty late at night and the restaurant wasn't packed, but we didn't seem to have the service problems a lot of other yelpers encountered.   Pros: - Great food, lots of different sides. My favorite bean paste stuff I've had in Vegas. - You'll have infinitely better luck getting in here than at Tofu Hut. Also, more parking. - Quite affordable for the amount and quality of meat. Much nicer meat cuts than tofu hut. - Incongruous and lovably campy tiki party atmosphere! Korean Dramas on TV!  Cons: - No beef tongue!  - Service can be a bit on the slow side. Wasn't super bad, but we did have to ask and wait for water a few times. This seemed to stem from staff being busy, and they were super friendly.",

The brisket is good. Salad is pretty good. I like the flavor. Steamed egg was tasty. Their rice is nice and hot. Marinated spicy chicken was unique and yummy. Kimchi was really good and cold. Water was always refilled quickly without asking. They know how to do work here! Got the check and was confused why it was more expensive than we thought. We just decided to pay for it anyways. When we went to the cashier I saw on the menu it said they automatically ass gratuity to all parties 5 or less 15% or more 18%. Then out loud I said \"oh babe that's why, they already charged us for gratuity.\" She looked at us and looked concerned and I replied \"sorry it was our first time here.\" And then she was quick to apologize and say \"oh I'm sorry I didn't know usually our customers know so we don't say anything..\" And I said it was fine. She was really nice about it and I can tell it was a genuine response. The place is cute and clean too. Thumbs up to Korean garden! Now I know why people go here.",

Is bs, we had a group of like 15 so we split into about 3 tables and what do you know? We got charged.   The service was alright. After they seated us they took their time to ask us if we were ready to order with out giving us a menu.  If someone does go here please please read the menu at the bottom  They charge gratuity for parties of 5 and less so what I'm guessing is we have to show up with a fck load of people in order to not have a service charge.  There's also 3 different menus  Nevada 15.95 Locals 19.95 And I think vegas 25.95  The selections were alright for the prices but I mean is rather go somewhere else than to be told you can only have a certain selection with a certain amount of money.  The signs they have in the restaurant are also old, I've been told that it's a new management therefore everything else in the restaurant is old and it's being managed by someone else with the semi old policies",

We had a large party so I understand that it can be kind of chaotic, but before we even ordered food the waitress was upset that we had 3 tables and the kids weren't all sitting. The waitress said she could have sat other people. Our whole party was there except 1. We called ahead for reservations and there were plenty of empty tables throughout the resturante. So what was the problem?  Toddlers eat free. I informed her that 1 toddler would not be eating and the waitress got really upset and took away the place setting followed by berating us for our reservation number. We wouldn't have had to pay for her anyways so what was the issue? The party in our reservation was for seating not who would be eating.   I asked for a spoon but the waitress' reply was \"I put spoons out, but the kids were playing with them.\" I did not receive a spoon.   Additionally 1 toddler screamed for 2 seconds and the waitress immediately walked over and said we're being to loud to the kids that didn't even make a sound. She continued to say other patrons were complaining about the kids; however it was a 2 second scream followed by her appearance less than 10 seconds later. Did anyone really say anything?  At the end of our meal, while ordering ice cream the waiter didn't want to bother taking our order and decided to just walk away while we were saying the favor we wanted. A noticable scowl followed by snickering was observed.   Beyond the horrible hospitality the food was OK. However, a trip to the bathroom was required.",

Our waitress constantly checked on us and actually was cooking the food for us and all the tables as well. Meat was brought out very quickly and any assistance was immediate. This level of customer service is what brought is good experience to an amazing experience. Whatever they're doing here is working and I would highly recommend this place solely on their service!  NEXT, the food!:  Sides were all brought out and all of them were delicious. We ordered the Vegas package which is the cheaper of the 2. The brisket was good , the pork belly was great , and the bulgogi was INCREDIBLE!   Savory and tasty all around! I highly recommend this and it's CLEAN ! No smoke no smell just a great time.

    "text": "One of the OG Korean BBQ joint in Las Vegas. I have been coming here since my High School years, so it has a sentimental value among my siblings and I. The customer service has been consistent throughout the years with no big issues. However, do call ahead because it can get busy especially during large conventions and Lunar New Year events. Do keep in mind that this review is based on being an AYCE Korean BBQ. Korean food has exploded in the past years in Las Vegas and there is large influx with the opening of Hobak, Goong, Magal along with other well known AYCEs like Hwaro, Tofu Hut, Doh and Gen in Henderson.  A few items that we enjoy is the delicious, Beef Brisket. This particular cut served here is one of the favorite choice and the thin slices allow for a quick grill and eat. The serving per order is reasonable oppose to other places like Gen, where a limit is set to 3 meat dishes at a time.  Another aspect of KGB that we favor is the variety of Banchan, there is a good variety and some are quite tasty especially the House Salad. Another family favorite is Beef tongue, yes Dila ng Baka in Filipino. Tender and soft, pairs well with the sesame oil that is provided as a dipping sauce :). Plus they have various options for squid; regular or spicy and both are delicious.  The restaurant is open and functional with a good amount of spacing between tables and chairs. Plus with the modern look makes the restaurant more inviting than others. Great option for those in larger groups needing a good variety of options at a reasonable price point. Parking can be a hassle on the busy weekends but you can park in the main Chinatown Plaza and take a short stroll to the restaurant that is directly above Kaya Sushi.  2017 Yelp Review #29",

    "text": "New and improved KG bbq! Renovated everything. From the walls in the restaurant to new plates and tables. Menus a little different and have added some new items but not too drastic. I love this place and we go every weekend.  Meats are just on point for us. Brisket, pork belly and intestines. Straight to the point and what you expect in a kbbq joint. It got to the point where Jeanie (Not sure how she spells it), which is the owner, hugs us when we walk in. Kartika, Jayden, Eve and some others are amazing servers! There is a bit of rotation going and I miss a few of the previous workers but everyone we've met have been kind and helpful. They've become friends, and they're pretty damn awesome!   They did a stamp card for awhile. I dug that a lot, but they only did it for a bit. Wish they'd bring that back. Also, if they added some Korean pancake in the menu, it'd be perfect! Haha.   Anyway, when you get here, you'll never wait no longer than 5 mins. If busy, no longer than 15mins. It's large and you'll never have to wait more than an hour like some other kbbq spots. Also, if you have a large party like 6+, they have plenty of tables to accommodate you and your guests.   Last but not least, if it's your birthday and Kim is there with his rockin' clarinet, you will be serenaded with the birthday song! It's pretty badass!! Haha.   So, come through and get some kbbq!",

Whenever we asked for more food they would tell us no or to wait until everything on the table is eaten. Also. they're very rude and give you an attitude. Doesn't matter if you tip them or not, it's automatically included in the check. They advertise \"all you can eat\" but don't serve you all you can eat.  Wouldn't recommend coming here at all.",

    "text": "Well I have mixed feelings about this place. I'll start by saying what I love about this place is that you never have to wait to be seated as the place is almost always empty. On the weekend it gets busier but still they can easily accommodate a large crowd. Although the variety of items you can order pales in comparison to Hwaro, the meat is high quality and if you like kalbi like I do, it's worth it. The spicy octopus is fresh and packed with flavor. The japchae is delicious as well. What I don't like about this place is the service. The older lady always seems annoyed by our requests. They limit the number of items you can order at one rime, which is annoying when you have 9 people that want to order more than just 4 things. They also give you a HUGE potion of the cheaper meats like the brisket while skimp on the select cuts of meat like the short ribs. This annoyance makes the meal take longer because you can only order so much at a time. Also the service is similar to that of the DMV, mostly because even if you only have a party of two, they automatically add 18% tip to the bill. Yep the fine print on the sign at the table says parties of 5 or less there's a tip of 18% added. This is so annoying to me because the service sucks. Even if you're the only table in the place, you still have to hunt down your waitress at times. Will I be back? Probably if I'm super hungry and don't want to wait the line at Hwaro.",

The prices are different depending on the menu you pick. You need 2 or more people to do the AYCE meat.  You order your chosen meat, and they arrive in a good amount portion.  It also has a wide space, so it is great for big and small groups.  You usually cook the meat yourself, but the staff will help you in a quicker pace if you are struggling. My friends and I enjoy eating at Korean Garden for the Steamed Egg Soup and Beef Tongue.  The Steamed Egg(Gaeranjim), is one of my favorite dish at Korean Garden.  Like the name, it is steamed egg with a small amount of nice broth.  It makes the steamed egg more like a egg soup, but more thicker and fluffy. My recent visit we ordered the Pork Neck, which was nice and tender.  For the big meat like Neck, you need to cut it into smaller pieces.",

There was nothing special about this place that really stuck out to me. Food was average. Customer service lacked really bad. One big thing for me, is that, if you don't have amazing food then have amazing service to make up for that. Vice versa.   Our servers barley paid any attention to us but constantly checked on the other tables surrounding us. They weren't busy at all when we dined in. A few things that made me upset was when our server finally checked up on us & we ordered a few more items, my boyfriend was still talking to the server (asking for a refill of water since his was completely empty) and he just walked away in the middle of his sentence. Secondly, as we were paying our bill he says \"the rest of the change for me?\" I felt that was really rude to say considering the business you were giving us. I'm not one to ever not tip, I understand since I work in the food business as well. I always make sure to leave at least 18% every time I dine in. But I felt like this time around they didn't deserve my tip. (Tip is voluntarily.) The only thing I like this place it's another alternative when tofu hut gets too busy since it's down the street. But overall, it lacked food and and service. I would rather wait to be seated at another kbbq restaurant.",

Located in Chinatown, you park & walk up to the second floor where there is also an amazing bakery for dessert if you have room after the Korean BBQ.    The menu is simple, food is fresh & the server does all the work cooking it on the grill at your table (so tip well).  If you're new to Korean BBQ then I highly recommend this place!  I love the Kimchi, potato salad, bulgogi, salad, rice & side sauces.  I stick to this cause it is very filling!  The sides keep coming once the dishes are empty.  The Spicy pork, honey shrimp & chicken are also tasty & cooked to perfection.  They also serve wine & different beers.    We got the Spicy pork, chicken, bulgogi, baby octopus, a large Japanese beer, two glasses of wine for $113+ tip for four people.  Mom & dad have never been to such an awesome place so I had to give them the full experience.  They LOVED it!",

One thing I liked was that they let us to small orders of everything so we could take our options! I thing I wished they had were kalbi ribs! I mean I paid 25 dollars I expect the option to have galbi on there.   The service was okay but could of been better since the place was empty.

I go here almost every other week now because of my boyfriend. In my opinion, this place is a lot better than Tofu Hut, especially because they have potato salad :3   They have three different prices for AYCE and the cheapest one is great because it has all the food I want to eat. My favorite choices are the brisket, pork belly, and spicy marinated pork. I use to like the rib finger but the last time I tried it, I got all the fatty and tendon-like parts, which was unappetizing.   When it comes to service, they have great service when the restaurant is not fully packed. The younger women seem to care a lot about the customers and try their very best to help out all the customers that they are serving. Unlike the older women, they are very attentive and actually come over to check up on you when they see you staring to try to get their attention. The only bad part about the service really is when the restaurant gets packed. They become so understaffed and the wait for both seats and food is long  Even so, I always come back here because this restaurant is great for groups since it is spacious and clean. Their food is amazing and their service is great too.",

I say this because you will come out smelling like the restaurant and grilled meats. It's inevitable...  There are many all you can eat korean barbecue restaurants in Las Vegas. I would like to consider this place as one of the best ones here. When considering all you can eats, the value is everything. They have a 3-tier menu. Honestly speaking you don't need any other meat except the brisket (cha dol baek ee). This is because the others are pretty thick and heavy or heavily marinated. They also just don't taste good. The brisket is thin, light, and full of flavor. If you need more flavor then use the sauces that they give you.   There are ladies who come around to help you cook and what not, but you honestly never need any of their help because come on.... if you're a man, you know how to grill, if you're a woman, you know how to cook. Let's be real. There is no need to review the service because it is an all you can eat. They will be there when you really need them.   The all you can eat is only 15.95. If you are looking for Kalbi (Korean Marinated Beef), then you would go to Sura. You would be paying over 20 dollars there.",

I usually get the from the 'Nevada' menu - the Beef Brisket, Pork Belly, and Steamed egg. I know I only get three but thats more than enough, my family sometimes gets the spicy marinated pork it but I don't eat it - my brother loves it though. Also if you want to eat a lot I advise not to get the marinated chicken because it is very filling.",

    "text": "I regularly eat Korean in Annandale, VA, so this was definitely not the best Korean BBQ I've had, but it's a solid option if you're craving it while in Vegas.  The restaurant is located on the second floor of a strip mall in Chinatown, and the decor is very plain (typical Asian restaurant). The service is just alright - we were seated and served very quickly, but subsequent visits from the waitress were few and far between (annoying when you're trying to take advantage of an AYCE).  The side dishes were pretty good, and I was happy with the larger than usual quantities. The AYCE I ordered included pork belly, beef brisket, spicy chicken, and spicy pork. I usually judge the restaurant by their spicy pork, as it's my favorite, and this one was a little bit hit and miss - the first order we got was really good, but the second one seemed flavorless in comparison.  Next time I'm in town, I'll probably try a different place before coming back to this one.",

It's located in the same shopping center as Ichiza and Tea Station. We came in and were seated right away. The dining area is pretty big and we really enjoyed the ambiance.   There were three different AYCE options: Nevada, Vegas, and Spring Mountain. We went with Nevada. First, we ordered brisket, pork belly, and steamed egg. It came with the house salad and your typical KBBQ starters (kimchi, broccoli, tofu, etc.). I thought the salad was okay. The waitress quickly brought out the brisket and pork belly. The brisket was delicious, which was enough to seal the deal for us. Pork belly and steamed egg were good, but not amazing. We also ordered the marinated chicken halfway through. The chicken wasn't my favorite, there wasn't much flavor to it.   To sum it up, the AYCE kbbq was a good experience. My friends and I will definitely come back again, mostly for the delicious brisket. The service was great. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. We even watched as the owner played 'happy birthday' on the clarinet for another table, which we thought was cute. One downside would have to be that they close at 11, so late night kbbq here is not an option.",

There were 9 people in our party, that was originally 10 with 2 grills. Service was extremely slow due to the business volume. The most disappointing part of the whole evening was the staff telling us that our time was up when we tried to continue ordering. If a business is going to try and uphold a policy of time, the business should be able to provide the service in the amount of time allotted. Additionally, courtesy reminders should be routine as a service that you are going to automatically add to the check; however, in their defense, they were not staffed to be able to provide the service that they were charging. The finishing touch was the staff falsifying justifications in order to uphold the policies implemented by their non-English speaking boss. Bon Appetit",

I loved it right away. I tried other KBBqs around Vegas but I really stuck with Korean Garden. I love their Ponzu sauce! Anyway, they recently changed their price. Before it was $15.99 and now it's $19.99. Which is a huge jump, i was kind of frustrated but when they changed their prices, they did a \"stamp card\" , after 10 AYCE's you get one for free. I am frustrated that they removed that already. I just did one card, and could not get another one because they stopped it. IM A LOYAL COSTUMER. Together with my friends, we literally eat there every week. The waitresses and waiter know us already. SO I REALLY WISH THEY WOULD BRING BACK THE STAMP CARD. Oh and also PLEASE ADD A BABY CHANGING STATION IN THE RESTROOM. I have a 2yr old, and it's such a hassle whenever I need to change her while we're there. I hope my review's going to be acknowledged.

We knew we wouldn't be able to feed all of us in a timely manner that way, especially if there is a 90 minute limit, so the four of us moved to another table. Our company and I did enjoy the food, and for about $24 per person, that is a great deal. However, my husband and I did notice that one of our servers was not in the best mood. No one else noticed this, but when she put the food on the grill for us, she basically threw the food on there as if she was having a fit! My husband and I were speechless. She definitely showed that she was not happy. My husband and I didn't say anything because we didn't know everyone in our group and didn't want to give bad impressions on our part. The thing is, all of the other servers we had were extremely nice and accommodating. It was just that one server that gave us a not-so-nice evening. Maybe that one server was having a bad day, but she shouldn't have to take it out on customers, especially if we didn't say or do anything to provoke it. I don't think we will be back because of this, but I know not everyone is going to have the same experience we did.  Overall, the food is very good and most of the servers were very friendly.",

Especially their kalbi. It was delicious. Their servings are pretty good as well. It's the perfect amount.  I'm just disappointed w/ the service. We basically had 3 servers. The first server wasn't very accommodating. My husband asked for a fork several times since he doesn't know how to use the chopstick & wasn't able to eat for quite awhile. The other 2 servers were much nicer and handed him the fork right away. The first server came back w/ our second set of order & we were told that they'll replace the griller. After 10 mins the second server came to check on us and said the same thing. Another 10 mins passed by & third server came walking in & said she'll grab someone to change the griller. Finally a guy came in and changed it & we're able to continue our meal. Then we basically waited for awhile again to have someone get our desserts.   We literally wiped out everything. I mean we're really satisfied w/ the food plus we don't want any additional charges for leftovers. Since there were four of us , gratuity was already included in our bill. So I'm not sure if their service was like that considering they'll receive tip either way. I've seen much busier places w/ much quicker service. So to say \"busy\" is why they can't accommodate customers right away is an excuse. This place would have been a perfect five if they'll improve their service .",

I was satisfied but for me key elements were missing. For example, I love wrapping my delicious fresh bbq in picked radish and that wasn't an option, although it's standard for almost anywhere. We had a large party this night too and were for the most part ignored unless we tracked someone down. If everywhere else is packed, it's a solid spot, but don't set your expectations too high.",

    "text": "Where's the 0 star button? Right when I walked in I couldn't help but feel judged and the vibe was just so frustrating (low energy, uninterested, angry). Right at the beginning I felt like I wasn't wanted there or like the workers were angry that they had to serve us. They also kind of treat you like your stupid. For me, customer service is everything and that is exactly what I did not get here. All I got was a table of waitresses gossiping and gasping at the latest family scandal. This was still 1 whole hour before closing time. Not even in the last few minutes before they close. The waitress came maybe 2 times to take an order for a second round of meats, not to mention, when she did come over here, she was quick to leave to go back to where ever she was fooling around in the back during our dinner service. Should I even call it dinner \"service?\" I couldn't even order an ice cream (included with \"all you can eat\"), because they were took busy talking at their table and I didn't wanna interrupt their gossip. Food wise; I suppose it wasn't terrible, but it was nothing to go crazy for. Places like Hwaro and Gen Korean BBQ are much better. I'm pretty sure the only reason we payed that night was because we collectively got up and made our way towards the exit. They also charge 15% gratuity for their less than mediocre \"service.\" Or should I say \"nonexistent\" customer service.",

I would not have left anywhere near as much of a tip. If you have 5 or less people, it's 15% and 6 or more is 18%. You also all have to choose the same package, everyone at the table. We wanted the cheaper package because we won't eat any of the other package's extra stuff and they made us pay for the more expensive one. They also will only allow the table to order 3 items. We all like different things so we had to sit and wait forever to get our food and order something we wanted. Any other place I've gone to, they let you order whatever you want for ayce. I had to wait a good 30 minutes each time I needed a drink. I had to ask 3 damn people to get more water and nobody would come back to fill up my drink. Anytime we needed something refilled or added, we'd ask and then have to ask someone else. There was only 3-4 table of people in the whole place and they didn't even bother with us. No excuse. They never came to check on our food or us. Our plate was black, everything was burnt and stuck on it and it took them forever to come back to give us a new one. They finally came to change it when we had raw meat on it and told us to put the meat on our plates. They're food is ok, nothing was spectacular that I would rave about or tell you to try. I've been to other korean bbq placea around town and they were a million times better. I'm very upset about my experience. Was not worth the $70 it cost the two of us to eat there.",

I highly recommend the iced tea. It's barley tea & I haven't found another place that serves it. They also have a solid alcohol selection if that's what you're looking for.   As for the food.... Where to begin? Our usual go-to's are the honey garlic shrimp, beef flank, brisket, bulgogi, spicy octopus & spicy chicken. We love everything else on the menu, it's just we both agree on these items. You really can't go wrong. I highly recommend dipping the brisket into the sauces they provide... It's seriously so good!   How could I forget the sides?? Their kimchi is the best I've had (goes great with brisket). The Korean potato salad/mashed potatoes are to die for & so are the fish cakes. We also adore the pickled onions & jalapenos. They go great with any of the dishes!   All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant & surely you will too!",

However, after my recent visit, I will never go back again.  We went as a part of 5 and ordered the $23.95 all you can eat. We ordered total of 10 servings of meat and 2 soups (spreads into 3 orders since they don't let you order too much at once).   For our first two orders, the servings were quite small. We decided to order another serving of beef tongue. The server brought out a huge serving of beef tongue (picture attached).   When we were getting our check, the server told us they will charge us for excessive left over. Even though it seems like they purposely brought out an unreasonably big serving on our last order, since we didn't finish it we thought we will pay for the fee. However, the manager came out and said we will charge us $25 despite the sign on the table says $15 for excessive left over.   The manager argued it is $15 for 4 people, so she wants to charge $25 for 5 people. She said she is being nice to us. I don't understand how charging us $25 is being nice when the paper says nothing about $15 for four people.  We told the manager the serving of beef tongue seemed unreasonably big (mug bigger than all other meat we ordered). The manager said we should've ordered half portion. I asked her how am I supposed to know the serving will be bigger than other meat and she couldn't answer.   At the end, we settled for $15 additional fee. However, I will not be going back. The manager was quite rude and seems like the business is unethical.",

This place is a favorite of a friend's so after we helped another friend install a TV mount and put up his TV, this is where we came for lunch/dinner on a Sunday afternoon.   There are two options available for AYCE (All You Can Eat). Vegas Package at 19.95 and Spring Mt Package at 23.95. The entire party needs to pick the same package (fear of unable to restrict the sharing among the group without strict supervision)  Vegas Package includes Cha Dol (Brisket), Premium Sam Gyup Sal (Pork Belly), Pork Skin, Pork Neck, Beef/Pork Galbi, Beef/Pork Bulgolgi, Spicy pork/chicken/pork belly, teriyaki chicken, baby octopus, spicy/regular calamari, gyoza, steamed egg, casserole, Korean bean paste stew, house salad, and ice cream (you can see they put a sticker over the previously offered rice paper roll).   Spring Mt Package includes everything the Vegas Package does, but additionally, pork shoulder, thin cut sam gyup sal (pork belly), beef tong, dak chang (tripe), chi ma sal (flank), honey garlic shrimp, shrimp with salt, seaweed spring rolls, jap chae, and spicy soft tofu soup.   For an additional only $4, my friend and I wanted the Spring Mt package but the other 6 wanted the Vegas package so we opt'ed for that.   We had ordered the brisket, pork belly, spicy chicken, beef galbi w/ some steamed egg originally. The portion sizes were pretty big. I don't know if it varies due to party size but for each order, we got a really large amount of brisket, spicy chicken, and beef galbi. Overall, pretty decent quality of meats throughout. Various banchan available including kim chi, potato salad, fish cake. The brisket was good. Not much of a fan of marinated meats but they were ok.   Not a bad place. Only downside is the offerings are quite minimal. Beef tongue is not included in the Vegas Package is a bit saddening. Wish they had beef tongue included as there already isn't much of a selection in terms of non-marinated items. Steamed egg was decent but I feel like its much smaller than those others that offer steamed egg as well. Quite deflated even before getting to the table, which makes it even smaller than it already is.   The ventilation in this place is horrible, if they even work at all. Our hood that spanned the table did not seem to be ventilating anything. Upon entry of the restaurant, you can already tell its pretty bad when there was only 2-3 groups here and it smelled pretty heavily already. Service wise, not bad. They gave us a pitcher of water as well as went around with another to help refill. Fairly decently attentive in terms of ordering and asking if anything is needed. I guess its a bit expected especially since it wasn't busy.",

But as luck would have it, our fave place was packed to the hilt and our large group was beyond hungry and would settle for any place that had ample space and immediate seating -- so I reluctantly ushered everyone to KG. Surprisingly, the place got a good facelift, gone are the greasy floors and barbecue smoke-filled dining area due to insufficient ventilation. Service was also upgraded with a very attentive staff that catered to all our requests without fail. But the real improvement was the quality of the meats, we're no longer served with fat-riddled beef and pork, this is now up to par with everyone else in town and even the side dishes are now deliciously on point. I'm hlad the OG KG stepped up its game, they are now definitely back on our rotation and I'd urge anyone who's been here before and swore it off to give the place a second chance -- or maybe not -- se we can have the place to ourselves",

I felt it was decently priced for the variety of options to choose from. The Vegas package was pretty affordable at $19.95 per person, and I think I would have been happy with that option as well. We never had to wait long for any of the meat to arrive. I highly recommend any of the gal-bi, bulgogi, and honey garlic walnut shrimp (THE BEST shrimp I've had from a Korean BBQ place).

Kinda lame you can only order four at once but it's not a problem to me.  The banchans (side dishes) offered are well portioned and tasty. There's also steamed eggs and soup.

I enjoyed Tofu Hut for their Soon Dubu Chije, but I haven't returned since the SNHD closure. Anyway, I was hesitant as usual to visit Korean Garden, but I was surprised to not hate it. :D  Three AYCE menus: Nevada ($16.95): Brisket, Pork Belly, Marinated Chicken, Spicy Chicken, Spicy Pork, Large Intestine, Steamed Egg, Bean Paste Soup, and House Salad. Vegas ($20.95): \"Nevada\" items plus Kalbi, Bulgogi, Spicy Squid, and Japchae. Spring Mountain ($24.95): \"Vegas\" items plus Beef Tongue, Dumpling, Shrimp, and Beef Tofu Soup.  Rules: Everyone at your table needs to choose the same type of menu if they're doing AYCE. Minimum of two people. There is a time limit of 1.5 hours. Automatic gratuity of 15% for parties of 5 or fewer and 18% for parties of 6 or more. AYCE menus are not available during convention weeks. Finally, the more obvious; no sharing with non-AYCE diners and you cannot take leftovers.  So, the food? The Banchan was bleh. We were served cabbage kimchi, radish kimchi, potato salad, fish cake, and pickled radish. The cabbage kimchi was terrible, but the radish kimchi was all right. The potato salad sucked too. The other two were just whatever. The House Salad was good; really fresh lettuce and a nice dressing. The mandu was the frozen type, so it was just okay. The Beef Tofu Soup or Soon Dubu was bad. This was the main reason we chose the \"Spring Mt.\" menu because they normally charge $13 to order this soup separately from AYCE. First, they give you a lunch portion (very small hot pot - I placed my chopsticks next to it in the photo for reference) and it has NO flavor. Either they do not use a stock/broth or their stock/broth sucks. There's no depth and no salt, so all you taste is water and gojukaru (Korean chili flakes). The contents are decent though; beef, lots of soon dubu, zucchini, and onion. Bottom line: Don't order the tofu soup.  For meat, we ordered Brisket, Kalbi, Pork Belly, Spicy Pork, Beef Tongue, and Shrimp. Everything was good! The kalbi didn't have the best cut (it's supposed to be short ribs) or marinade, but it was surprisingly decent. We really liked the brisket, beef tongue, and spicy pork (this marinade wasn't phenomenal either, but it was still relatively good). The shrimp was fresh and tasted great grilled.   Overall, the meal was satisfying and decent. Unless you're hellbent on having Kalbi, Bulgogi, Squid, Shrimp, Beef Tongue, Dumplings, Japchae, and/or Tofu Soup, stick with the \"Nevada\" menu for $17. However, for just an additional $8, you get everything and it's still a killer deal.",

My favorite thing is that this place offers daechang, which is usually not found elsewhere in Vegas. I always walk out of this place full, happy, and satisfied.",

Just like the ayce you can find at sushi bars or at buffets.    The service here is so-so.  Our waters didn't come until we were half way through our meal and they were not refilled unless asked to.  Also be warned, the control knob for the grill sits under the table in the center.  When turning on or adjusting the fire setting, two waitresses felt it ok to just reach over me with out so much of an 'excuse me, pardon me' before hand.  That is not ok.    Despite all of that, the food here is pretty good and I'll probably give this place another try.. maybe.  If you're a first timer, however, keep in mind that there are better ayce kbbq joints within a miles radius of this place..  You might just want to head there instead.",

At our most recent visit, it took 30 minutes for us to get our water after we were seated! We kept asking the waitress to bring it, but she always forgot. Alongside that, our food also took a long time to come out, and she constantly forgot to bring back our rice.   They now automatically apply tip to your bill. I HATE that. It's not like we had a large party, there was only 3 of us. We were all going to tip anyway, but they shouldn't automatically pull 20% from us like that, especially with the level of service we received!   I used to be a KG faithful, now I'm on the search for a new AYCEKBBQ place.",

There was a fly in my friend's drink and we respectfully notified our server, she apologized but another server (or I'm assuming was a manager on duty) explained that the fly wasn't their fault. I was caught off guard because it appeared that she was trying to fight us on it. It got pretty intense and we just wrapped up our meal and left. Our server was nice but the other lady who blamed the fly being in my friend's drink on us was very rude, she was speaking aggressively in another language to other employees while looking at us. That was my last visit. The meat is good but you could find other kbbq places that's cheaper and has better customer service.",

Also you wouldn't have to eal with the lousy customer service and decide when and how much meat you want.  I did not drink water that whole day so I finished my cup in about 10 mins. The waitresses, more than one, would come to put plates of food on our table and not even fill up or care about my water!  I had to keep asking them which was pretty annoying since they obviously saw my empty cup when they placed new plates and took old plates away.   Same thing happened with the rice bowls. We asked for three more bowls of rice and never received it and they weren't even busy....",

The parking lot is crowded and a bit scary from the creepy men walking to the massage parlors.    The food is classic.  Big portions, always delicious and they make something special if you ask.

She was miserable and did not even smile or say hello or welcome. MAJOR ATTITUDE. We wanted to order the childrens food ahead of time. The waitress, first time talking to us, said the children had to sit at a separate table. What! Two of the children just turned four and clearly needed assistance eating! She then chimed in and said because we were cooking table top BBQ we all had to order the same thing! A couple of the guests did not eat meat so they wanted to order something else. She said it was not allowed. Her tone was not pleasant at all. We got up and left. That was the worst service I have ever had - I don't know how they stay open for business.

I've experienced better.\"  I should have known by the yelp reviews and that should have been backed up by the almost totally empty restaurant (well, it was a Monday night)...  but it wasn't my choice to eat here anyway.  Our group ordered the seafood pancake, fried fish (covina, I think), kalbi, spicy pork, and chicken.  The meat flavors were a little bland compared to other Korean places I've been to and the portions were small for the price.  The seafood pancake was pretty good.  The fish was very dry and overcooked.  I was a little disappointed in the ban chan (small dishes) as some other places I've gone have had a bigger offering of these free side dishes.  Vegas has a lot of great places to eat, so I'm sure you could do much better than coming here.",

Never come back to this place again, no wonder they only has us and another group as customers!",

Sure would have been nice if this was stated online somewhere before I went there nothing!  This was about 6:00 PM and the restaurant was practically empty.  There was only a few customers there and a lot of empty tables.",

We like this choice cause we love the beef rib tip they have. I personally think their customer service is pretty good. They'd always ask you if you need any more food or sometimes they'll cook the meat for you and cut it up as well. Just keep in mind that most of the people that works here are koreans so they have a different approach on customer service. Overall, i love this place and their food",

We found ourselves ordering twice as much, just to get enough.  At the prices they charge, which is at least 25% more than comparable restaurants, it is all a bit much.  The service here can be spotty,  as we have found after trying the place off and on for the last few years.  Be prepared for the lack of English speaking proficiency, leading to the most basic of service.",

All food they serve is made from the scratch and their kimchi is the best I ever tasted in Las Vegas.  Clean and cozy atmosphere welcomes customers and allow them to enjoy the meal.

Quality of the cuts of meat were good, but they put, no dumped it on the grill instead of placing each piece especially with the beef brisket, and pork ribs. A word about the pork ribs...they were not cut properly (I have worked at a  restaurant) we couldn't even eat these, absolutely unappetizing.  My honest rating is  would NOT recommend you go there.",

Just be careful if you go in another plaza because there's no connection to this plaza. You'd have to go back onto the busy street if you accidentally go in the wrong one. The place is on the 2nd floor. You can use the elevator or go up the stairs.  Parking: There's enough parking. Just drive around the back.  Service: Slow. We went on a Sunday. Initially there was one girl working but as it got busier, another girl came. Service was still pretty slow with the 2 female servers. There's no buzzard...you'd have to wave your hand or do something to grab their attention.  Food: Not a lot of choices. Meat was not fresh. Meat was frozen as you can you tell from the picture I uploaded.  But you know, for the price that we paid, I guess that's all we can expect.",

It says on the menu that kids 4 to 10 are half price but when we got the check the waiter insisted that it's diffirent that it's the wrong menu etc. First of all why do you give your guest the wrong menu? So we just like whatever we will just pay and not argue with the waiter. And then this is the worst part he took automatic gratuity for 3 people and one is a kid. So it's a total ripped off. So watch yo guys wallets when you go eat at this restaurant you will definitely get rip off. Definitely not coming back here.",

The service was alright, one person looked like he didn't want to be there but he helped us the best he can but another lady was excited and happy to help us.   The quality meat is good but not out this world and the portion size you get for the meat is worth it for 3-4+ (probably too much for 1-2 people but it's okay you can ask for half the amount when ordering the meat). The sides you get especially that sweet black sauce(forgot what it was called) is amazing with rice and brisket!  I enjoyed my experience here. There's better spots in Vegas for Korean bbq but I wouldn't mind coming back here with friends.",

Not only will we never be back, we didnt even stay for dinner, even after being seated. Yes, our large party up and left after we saw the menu and realized how expensive it was for such a small variety of food. They offer 3 menus. The $16 has about 8 items, the $20 about 12 items and the $25 has about 15 items. Problem #1 your entire party/table has to get the same menu. Problem #2 (more of a personal once because it is my fav) they dont have Kalbi on any of the menus. Problem #3 they charge full price for anyone over 7, now i want to meet a 7 year old who can eat just as much as a full grown adult.   We left and went to Sura where the selection is about 4 times that of Korean Garden, they charge half price for kids under 12 and yup they have Kalbi. The service there is great as well.   Truly a disappointment",

Here's a break down:  -parties are seated in random order; they don't keep track of who came when, so there's a good chance you'll wait longer than the people who just walked in -if you order in English (as I did) you'll probably get ignored, but if you order in Korean (as my husband did), you have a chance they'll at least write your order down (though they won't actually bring it all) -it's nearly impossible to get drink refills, and it's also difficult to get the servers to bring essentials like chopsticks, straws, and napkins to the table -if it's not clear already, it's worth noting that the servers are inefficient and unfriendly, to say the least -but despite this bad service, the most shocking part is that **THERE'S AUTOMATIC GRATUITY FOR PARTIES OF TWO** (maybe because their service rarely warrants any tips?) In the end, it was a disappointment because the food was good, but the service was perhaps the worst I have ever experienced.",

You get your typical house banchan sides, steamed egg, bean paste soup and salad. The choice of meats varies from what price point you choose.   Our favorite is the Angus Beef Fingers, not sure why they call it that since it's not in strip like chicken fingers but more like slices of meats. It's marinated in the bulgogi style.   If you're looking for price point choices this is the place to go. When they do get busy the service can be  a bit slow.  Don't come during convention season they get packed, I think every resturant in Chinatown does though. Lol",

One of the first things I always notice when we enter restaurants is how many people are in it. This place was packed at 9pm. Makes me think that this place really must be good (and it is!). Their portions are very generous, as you can see in the photos. The service was really good. They are very friendly; they check on you every now and then; they cook the meat for you; and they were very accommodating of us having a baby. They made sure that we were all comfortable and having a great time. The meat was of great quality. I loved the plain beef and pork so much. Their bulgogi beef is also very good. Everyone loved it. I love that they give you a lot of side dishes and you can always great a refill. It was definitely a great experience for me and my husband. We'll come back soon hopefully!",

While we were waiting to be seated,  the waitresses continously said excuse me and walked right in between my friends and I when there was space to go around.  Even after we moved to get out of the same spot,  they still tried cutting in between us.    When we finally sat down and looked at the menu we chose the vegas because it sounded the most appealing.  Oh and they made their prices more expensive than last time I was here which is pretty lame. The food was good but not the best ayce in vegas. You are limited to only ordering 3 items at a time which makes the process much slower. And again with the service, we didn't get water until half way through our meal. They also ran out of rice and so we also had to wait 30 minutes for it.   It was not worth it in the end. The price of eating here went from the $20 vegas to $26. The service was not 15% tip worthy.  They are the only place that charges automatic gratuity for parties of 5 or less for service that is not worth it.   For $26 there are better options like honey pig or sura.",

After waiting for a good 10 minutes and us having our appetizers already at our table I Had to get the napkins and chopsticks myself from another table!  We have visitors from out of town and this is our go-to place every.single.time!   So today, here we are.   BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!   Had to flag our server for water refill, ordering of beers, more meat and to change to change our grill.   Ordered extra rice and pork belly never came!  We upgraded from Vegas to Spring Mountain- ordered our 1st shrimp and by the time our server came back it was 20 minutes after. Ordered our 2nd batch of shrimp, 10 minutes later had to flag our server down AGAIN and ordered our 3rd batch of shrimp-- She came back and said we are on our 1.30 mark and that would be our last order! UNBELIEVABLE!   We ordered Sapporo, it was given to us no problem. Ordered miller lite and she wanted to ID us, we asked and said you've given us the Sapporo without asking for ID why is it that all of a sudden she wanted to id us for a second batch of beer.  Gratuity is automatically included and I think that is why their service is going down!  This is truly a good clean place to have k BBQ but they should not include gratuity automatically to the bill!   This is where we bring ALL our family and friends from out of town BUT never again until they turn around and offer efficient, courteous service!   So EMBARRASED for bragging about this place to our cousins!   Had to get a copy of our receipt and the name of our Server- Angie. Just an advice- be genuine, efficient and enjoy the company of your customers! Might as well have fun while working and truly fulfill the needs of the hungry customers.   For the caliber and price of food, you can get amazing food and great quality of service from neighboring Kbbq places!   Picture of the receipt attached- $117.56 and not a bit enjoyed the service!",

If you are looking for a nice down to earth place to satisfy your meat cravings look no further. All you can eat starts at $16.95 per person, 2 people minimum for a table. For people have been to a Korean BBQ before, the service is very typical. For people haven't been to a Korean BBQ before, the service is slightly better than your typical chain restaurants like Apple Bee's or Chili's. For the people with super low reviews, where do you go get better service for all you can eat? Especially at this price? The service is no worse than the big name buffets on the strip and you don't have to pay 3 times the price for meat.",

    "text": "I usually go to Tofu Hut, but they were very busy and had a long waiting list. I tried this place a couple weeks ago and felt that they lacked in their customer service. Not only did they keep ignoring our table and walking past us, but whenever they ask if we need anything or if I ask for food, they would forget what we had asked for. While we were waiting for our second order of food, some other lady had come over and just turned the heat off. Once we got our food, we had to ask them to turn the heat back on. Upon getting the receipt, we noticed that a party of 5 or less is 15% gratuity while a party of 6 or more is 18% gratuity. No wonder they have bad service. They get their tip anyway.  I had tried giving this place another chance today since their food tasted good and my boyfriend hasn't had Korean BBQ in a long while. It was the same issue: bad service. We had to ask the waitress to refill our water multiple times. Not only that, but one of the waitresses had turned our heat low and when we had gotten our food, it wasn't cooking fast enough. My boyfriend had accident turned the heat off and we just sat there, waiting for a waitress to come over. It took 5+ minutes for a waitress to be seen and she just tried walking past us. When we got her attention, we asked to get the heat started again and she just nodded and went to help another table. We got her attention again she assumed we wanted to change out the grill. She understood once we said it clearly and then walked away. Knowing how their service is, we got up and walked to the front for them to give us our check and to pay.   I would not recommend to come to this location for your ayce Korean BBQ. They set a limit of an hour and a half to eat, their gratuity is automatic, and their service is horrible.",

    "text": "Was in LV with a friend, to pick up a package.  Lunchtime rolled around and we just happened to find ourselves on Spring Mountain road across the street from a large sign that said, \"All You Can Eat Sushi.\"  We pulled in to the parking lot and checked out the sushi place, but my friend wanted AYKEKB instead.  I live in Torrance, CA where you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a Korean restaurant, so I was hesitant.  But my friend insisted and we soon found ourselves walking up the stairs to Korean Garden.  The place was nothing special:  Formica tables with a grill and a smoke hood.  The place seemed a little dated and not very busy.  We were greeted by a couple of ajumas and shown to a booth by the window.  The menu was of the Set A for $, Set B for $+, Set C for $$, etc.  We chose our meat and ordered drinks.  Beer choices were Hite, OB, Sapporo and Coors Lite.  My friend had a Hite, I had a lemonade (canned).  The good:  The service was excellent.  Our meat dishes were brought out promptly and the staff lit the grill and proceeded to cook it for us.  Banchan were plentiful and replaced as soon as we ate them.  The meats were excellent.  We had two servings of brisket, rib meat, bulgogi, spicy chicken and pork belly.  The seasoned meats were not overly seasoned so you could taste the actual meat.  The unseasoned beef was tender and flavorful.  I loved the fried salt for dipping. The meat and service were both worth at least 4 stars.  Well worth the price.  The bad:  The banchan.  I know most people don't go to this kind of place for the side dishes, but they are part of the meal.  The napa kimchi tasted old and extremely sour.  The texture was too soft, almost as if spoiled.  This didn't seem to bother my friend who is more of a Korean noob.  More was brought out and it was just as bad.  Persian cucumber kimchi tasted very bitter.  Twice.  I love meat, but I also love a good kimchee on the side. This kind of ruined the meal somewhat for me. Other banchan were OK, beansprouts, shredded daikon in sweet vinegar, fried tofu.   Overall, I liked the meal, but they really should do something about the side dishes.  I'd really like to give this place 4 stars, but I can't.  This place is pretty good for the tourist or people who just want to try something a little different. Great meat, service and a decent price.  For a purist, there are probably better out here.",

The side dishes were too few and absent the favorites such as cucumber Kimchi and bean sprouts. Worse, they no longer serve a scallion salad which is fundamental to any good Korean beef BBQ. Leave this place to fail. We are desperately now searching for a new Korean BBQ.",

Service is always fine (hey, you are at a Korean BBQ place, not a 4 star french restaurant), food is good, people are nice.

We were waiting on 2 people and they were literally 2 minutes away and we asked the server (after calling for her because we had been sitting there for 10 minutes without being greeted) if we could start ordering. Her being rude you could imagine how she sounded when she told us we have to wait for our whole party to show up and that \"we could wait\". If we could wait we wouldn't be trying to order for the whole party as they're parking to meet us. A minute later the rest of the party shows and we get ready to order. We were told that if we eat all you can eat that we have to order the same thing...we had no choice!! One of my friends just wanted soup. Her sister just wanted noodles. Me and my girl wanted the all you can eat. THIS IS NOT PERMITTED HERE. We were told if we wanted to order that way we had to sit at different tables!!! Keep in mind the fine print on the menu does not say any type of RULE like this. They have a alacart part of the menu so how could this be a \"rule\". After explaining to the server that the 2 others that came with us will not be eating off our all you can eat and that what they are ordering had nothing to do with them cooking the food on the grill on the table they still insisted that this was not permitted. We decided to go to tofu hut instead which is real close. They had no such rule and the place was packed. This is not the end. We had to pay for the 2 sodas that we never drank. So of course we asked for to go cups and they acted like they did not want to do it... long story short, don't waist your time....oooohhhh and I forgot. If you plan on eating there alone, just turn around because you have to have a person with you. So no eating there by yourself...smh",

    "text": "I love Korean food, and being Korean, it's practically in my DNA. :-)  My fav thing to order wherever I go, and a good barometer of how good a place is is to check out their:  Soondubuchigae - spicy and hot, a perfect combo Galbi - chewy without being stringy or dry  Now this place also gives out really good banchan as well, which gives it a four star rating.   Try it, you won't be disappointed.",

The meats have a lot of flavor and I believe this is where I tried Sundubu for the first time. Like I said in my review of DJK, my loyalties lie with Min Sok Chon or Mother's...but I gave this a 5-star because KG-BBQ popped my Las Vegas Korean restaurant cherry.  Thanks KG-BBQ House! :)",

I enjoy the soups especially the yuk gae jang (I request it medium spicy, otherwise its extra spicy) and kim chee chigae and my husband enjoys the bulgogi and nang-myun.  The food is delicious and normally comes out pretty fast which we love!  The staff is always friendly and provide excellent service.   Its not as good as the food in LA but pretty darn good for the Korean restaurants out here.",

I am from LA and we eat at korean bbq joints all the time. And this one is just as good as the ones we go to in LA. I've never done the all you can eat. I've always just gone there for dinner. As long as we are forced to go to CES every year, we will always go to this place for korean bbq.",

    "text": "FOOD POISONING.  But I'll get back to that later.  First, let me comment on something else.  My brother had a big business dinner here with several of his business clients.  The bill came out to $600 and he left a 15% tip.  On his way out of the restaurant, however, the manager ran after my brother and demanded that he leave a 20% tip--IN FRONT OF HIS CLIENTS!  My brother was so mortified that he just signed the 20% and left, but this should have never, never happened.  Mind you, there was no written statement anywhere saying that a 20% tip was the minimum.  And it's not like he left no tip or a 5% tip--he left 15%!  Anyway, the worst part of the story is that two of his business clients got FOOD POISONING that night after eating there.    END OF STORY.",

It was apparently too loud for one of the waitresses who told  us he was making way too much noise and other customers were complaining.  That would have been fine if (1) It was a fancy place and (2) They weren't blasting techorave music!!!--yes, it was blasting...and I didn't see anyone looking disturbed.  I'm thinking the waitress was just being an a-hole (The others were really nice and seemed almost apologetic). Botton line --My poor son wasn't aloud to laugh out loud.  Sorry.  I have too many choices for Korean barbeque (cheaper with better food and better service).  I'm not coming back :)",

    "text": "Went here for dinner. Paid the $19.99 price for the \"extended\" menu and it was worth it. The boneless galbee was tender and tasty, the chicken had a good marinade, the bulgogi was not fatty like some other please, and all of the sides were good. I tried beef tongue for the first time and it was delicious. The staff was attentive, they brought out big portions, and they changed the grill often. I'll be going to this place more often. -1 star because they don't give you soft serve ice cream like a lot of the korean BBQ places in cali...haha.",

    "text": "Okay so I am a HUGE fan of korean!!!!!! I stumbled upon this AYCE restaurant and was a little skeptical at first, I mean could it be True all you can eat for 19.95 or 17.95???? My bf is obsessed with Spicy chicken, so he special ordered that which they included. The Dumplings were awesome. So that was a good start, they brought out the raw meat and it looked and smelled really fresh. They started the meal off with the calamari whis was yummy with their special sauce. The Spicy pork was MMMmMMMmMM!! I honestly cant say that any of the food was just okay. They ended the meal with some \"desert tea\" which i loved, when i asked how they made it the waitress came back with a to tub of it! I was so greatful, everyone was so nice and they were very attentive! My bf doesnt really like many different foods, and he was very impressed. Def. will be back!!",

My favorite salad was gone and replaced with what appeared to be bagged iceberg lettuce with tasteless dressing.  The meat was bland.  Plus the service was not up to par.  I doubt we will be going back here and we have been long time customers.",

Pretty good, attentive, friendly service. The meat was really good actually. The sides were okay. The atmosphere was a tad dingy, but--check this out--they had a mouthwash dispenser in the bathroom, complete with little Dixie cups. Genius! All KBBQ restaurants should have that!",
