    "text": "Once a month, I like to come to Metro Pizza with some friends and family or even by myself and enjoy the pizza happy hour. The food is great but it also costs a lot more than other pizza parlors. I'd say you get what you paid for. That's why the weekday Tuesday-Thursday happy hour deal is so nice.... if you come at the right time.  The service is a little below average- the waiters are slow in their pace and usually bored. I usually don't mind since I'm busy talking or doing my own thing. This past Tuesday, I came in by myself for a Large stuffed pizza (Skyline) at 1:50 PM, totally forgetting that happy hour is between 2:30-4:30. The pizza was big but average tasting. When I got the bill I was bummed that I totally forgot the happy hour times but it's totally fine since I like supporting family businesses. When I brought the check to the counter to pay, I mentioned to the cashier that I totally forgot about happy hour.   I would have been thrilled if they honored it, or it would have still been just fine if they just said sorry. Instead, the lady told me, \"Yeah... I guess you'll just have to skip pizza for a bit.\" I paid and left a lot angrier than I expected. How about I skip Metro Pizza altogether? Seriously, I wouldn't waste my time to write this review if I wasn't this angry, 3 days after the fact just remembering her response.  5/5 Star Pizza 3/5 Star Price 0/5 Star Customer Service",

It's been about 9 months or so and we ordered a Gotham and Chicago style loop plus wings extra extra crispy. The wings came barely cooked and the Gotham just had a bunch of ground meat dumped all over and the green peppers were not completely done. It was awful. The Chicago style Loop had absolutely no cheese and was flat. We have ordered the same 2 pizzas and never has this happened. We threw most of it away it was so bad. This is after paying $78 plus tip. Absolute fail. We will not be back.  Just disgusting. Sad to see a great local place go so far downhill. Have been eating there for over 20 years.",

Overall the pizza is BOMB and the service is excellent, the only thing is the music.. Ugh! It would be so chill if they played 80s music. Idk if they are able to control the music but it would be chill if the music matched the theme of the place. Great place for a fun date, family, or group of friends!",

Sooo we finally went there together and I now must hang my head and say that I am a believer in Metro Pizza.  I got the chicken and herb calzone, he got the small Gotham.  The calzone (which was HUGE) had fresh tomatoes and herbs, cheese was evenly melted, and the chicken was nice and juicy.  As much as I hate to admit it, though, his pizza trumped all others I've had in Vegas.  The meat was juicy chunks of ground beef and pepperoni.  The crust was just the right amount of flaky and crunchy.  Mmmmm!!  Our waiter was very sweet and polite.  He seemed to be a hard worker as he was not only helping us, but cleaning about and doing other duties while the others didn't seem to be doing much.  Unfortunately, there was a weird smell towards the back of the restaurant where we were seated.  Almost a wet table rag smell.  The food and service made up for it though.  Definitely recommend Metro Pizza, maybe as take out... and I definitely will be back for more.",

She asked if I bought the gift card the day before, on black Friday.  I said I didn't and learned they had a 2 for 1 gift card for their Black Friday special.    Anyhow, I get back with the pizza and it was good.  Just a plain cheese without the bells and whistles.    I gave it 4 stars because it was a bit of a drive for me to pick up a pizza.

That's great and all, but I want the REAL Metro Pizza story... the one that CLEARLY starts somewhere around '85 with a BetaMax machine and lots and lots of recorded episodes of Miami Vice... or a love for AC Slater and Screech, as evident by the awesome 80s decor that hasn't been retouched since, well... the 80s.   Seriously! In all its pastel painted glory and neon finery this place is legit and a GREAT place to grub!  I ordered the Meatball Sliders - four garlic knots cut into little 'buns\" complete with meatball, melted provolone, and sauce and served with fries. I ordered my sliders with the Garlic Romano fries, crisp fries dusted in Romano cheese and minced garlic... they were delicious and I'd definitely recommend the sliders if you want something other than pizza, the meatballs were perfectly seasoned and cooked...juicy, not overdone...so good.   The BF ordered a 16\" thin crust pizza with pepperoni... oh man, the grease was literally oozing onto the plate... haha... Greasy pizza means fresh ingredients and that it's gonna taste yum! I was surprised to see him put away three slices like it was nothing. I traded a slider for a slice and gained at least 4 lbs after that meal but oh man... good stuff. We even had half a pie to take home with us!  Metro has some of the best pizza I ever did eat. Ever. It's really THAT good.   The staff is super friendly... our food was delivered piping hot and we were never without drink refills. Loves it.",

I know, I know.. but after have a fantastic meal it's kind of hard to run (should you need to) from any unsavory characters that might be following you around in the parking lot. Neighborhood is not so hot.  Location aside lets talk about my experience. My friend had it right when she said the ambiance reminded her of being on Saved by the Bell. Bright neon lights, black and white checkered flooring, good thing the 90's look is back in.  Being a fan of all things retro (and sad to say that I can refer to the 90's now as being retro), I enjoyed the cheesy decor.  Service was fantastic, we were celebrating a birthday and had a large party but were seated right away and had stellar service the entire time.   The food equals delicious!  Soo... I'm doing the not eating fattening foods thing (again) so I ended up ordering their Dominica (sp?) salad while everyone else indulged in pizza *insert sad face here*.  Guess what?! I am a picky salad person and I can honestly say this was one of my favorite salads of all time!  Fresh ingredients and delicious dressing (I went with their house dressing), and excellent portion size.  I did snag a bit of the pizza crust from one of my fellow diners, it was crunchy and delicious and no doubts about it, should I have a hankering for a tasty slice of pie I would venture back to Metro Pizza without a second though (shady neighborhood and all).",

I got the Gotham, because you need to taste toppings rather than just a cheese pizza. What I got was under cooked and very oily. Yes I know the meats will add oil, but to leave puddles of it on the plate, that is a no go. It actually got better after I cooked it in my oven at 350 degrees for 10 min. I have to say that I have had better from other places here in Las Vegas.  The saving grace were the meatball sliders, now those were good, and had I just ordered those this would be a better review. The knots were fresh, cooked correctly and every thing was in balance.   Over all the 2 star rating was due to the pizza, and the service I got from the person behind the counter who had to be reminded to give me my slider order with the pizza. Maybe I will try again, but not for pizza.  Oh the kicker is that wanted to charge me $15 to deliver their food to me. Be careful, since their site does not say any thing about the charges you might get hit with,",

I was finally able to try their early bird special. From 2:30 to 4:30 every Monday through Thursday, they offer 50% off every pizza on their menu. I never get the opportunity to take advantage of this offer, until New Year's. I got home early from work and I just couldn't resist trying out their discounted pizza.   We tried The Loop, a stuffed pizza. It was my first time trying any of Metro's less traditional pies. The pizza was enormous, my mom and I were only able to finish one piece each and we had leftover pizza for the rest of the week. I had wished that the pizza would be stuff with more sauce and our server had recommended we have our sauce on the side as well, since we'd likely be taking it home for later. That was a smart idea, but it also left the pizza a little dryer and less flavorful than I would have liked. Next time, if I order this again, I will definitely get a smaller pizza so I could order the sauce on top to allow it to soak in and really saturate the pizza.   Overall, they aren't my favorite pizza in town, but they are solid and they have excellent deals for lunch and early bird, that I just can't seem to resist.",

I love that the meatballs are stuffed inside a garlic knot, it combines some of my favorite ingredients: meat, cheese, and garlic knots (YES PLEASE!). Well honestly, I'm not a huge fan of meatballs, but these have pretty good flavor, so I guess I'm a fan of Metro's meatballs. It's four meatball sliders in an order and they come with parmesan fries, delicious as well. We always do take out so I cannot speak on the dining experience.",

Upon arriving, I wait a few minutes and leave with my order. I get down the road and I check the pizza, it's the wrong one. I call them and the girl says we can credit you for next time. I just drove 25 minutes to treat myself tonight. I tell her I'll just come back. They switch the  pizzas, no problem. I get home and open the salad, and it's the wrong dressing, with bread with no butter. Food was overall good, but the ordering to go was a huge let down. Hopefully they get it organized.",

Whenever we come to Vegas, we always come here to eat.  We either have the Gotham (see my recent picture series), or the Stockyard.  If you are on vacation in Vegas, please be sure that your hotel room has a refrigerator. because you are going to need it unless you have a monster appetite.  Rockin' pizza!  Fabulous service makes it even better.  If this joint is good enough to be a landmark in our marriage, I think you'll love it on your next trip to Sin City.  Make eating here one of the sins you're allowing yourself while visiting.  If you can, bring home leftovers--this is something that doesn't have to stay in Vegas.",

Too bad, so sad for me.  But I finally got the chance a couple of nights ago after 12 weeks of clean eating.  I earned this and I'm going to turn this mutha out.    This is not my first time to Metro Pizza.  This is just my first time at this one.  I've always been a fan of their pizza and let's not forget their garlic knots.  I shared half a pizza with my gf.  Okay, I actually ate 75% of the pizza, but who's counting?  My half included just pepperoni & mushrooms and Terri's was just mushrooms.  The pizza was tasty, thin, and not overly sauced out.  This is exactly how I like my pies.  As for the garlic knots, those little baked creatures didn't have a chance. The G-Knots are a bit greasy, small enough, and my goodness, the type of carbs my body has been missing.  Obviously, I'm a fan of Metro and wish to be back in another 16 1/2 weeks.    PS:  We had a slight issue when our pizza first arrived.  It was missing the mushrooms, but this was remedied quickly.  To top it off, we also got hooked up with canoli's.    BTW:  This Metro does remind me of Max's from \"Saved by the Bell\".  We're just missing Kelly Kapowski.    YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (438/500)",

Right away Keanu greeted us and walked us to our seat. We where given complementary bread with butter which was nice and hot and tasted great, I could eat that stuff all day. I order the 10 piece Hot Wings, my kid order Mac and Cheese and my Wife got Calamari. The food came in a good time about 15 mins after we order which is totally normal. The ranch dressing is the bomb, I actually want to buy a bottle of it and take it home. Every thing tasted great and the staff was amazing. Even though he was busy our waiter Keanu was very nice and professional, answered all our questions and even gave my daughter crayons and a crossword puzzle to keep her busy. Definitely will be coming back.",

Then why would they take an order from us, spell our street name incorrectly and send the pizza delivery driver out with the wrong address of a place that doesn't even exist? What did he think he would do, sniff us out?  I had to call her back to figure this out FOR HER. Wouldn't you have made sure you even delivered to us before you took the order? Made sure you knew where we lived first?   It gets better. They charge us $45 for a soggy pizza that finally showed but he managed to forget our salad. So my husband paid him and he went back for my salad. I found out it was missing and that he took the $45 plus $5 tip. I was quite upset. No comp offered and it had been well over an hour already. I called the manager and demanded our money back and to forget the food. So the driver came back with the money AND he took the pizza back with him that he left us. No class. Plus I'm sure he had to throw the pizza away since it was left at our house. Who would eat that coming back from a disgruntled customer?  It's a shame this happened. Dominos has messed up and handled the transaction well to make us happy in the end. This place had no clue. The pizza is too pricey to put up with subpar service and maybe even a snide dig on us (the taking back of the pizza).  So I ate a fiber bar and went to bed sad.",

Tasty warm bread with butter, the most reasonably priced wine in town, and pitchers of Fat Tire for less than $10.  The owners deserve a medal -- and should open one in L.A. ASAP!

The Decatur and Flamingo location is cozy and fun always a nice experience!  The Service is Fantastic every time I have dined here and I am unsure why I am now just submitting my review for this Awesome pizza and Pasta place?  Mmmmm yum what we ordered this time around was a Sicilian sub, spicy shrimp pasta and baked ziti.  The jam packed Sicilian sub was great and set on home hearth baked bread it just melts in your mouth!  The baked ziti loaded up with sauce, mozzarella and ricotta cheese it was the best!  The portions are very generous as you are guaranteed to be leaving with leftovers for another meal!  I have always had their pizza in the past which is very good however this is the first time I ordered a pasta dinner and am so happy I did!!!  The Spicy shrimp pasta was divine, the sauce spicy and so flavorful the perfect mix of goodness! The big shrimp mixed in as well was very good and all tied in with angel hair pasta. Soooo good and my boyfriend loved it as well because we shared both of our dishes.  We even saved $12 bucks off of our meal with an Entertainment book buy one dinner entree get one free. That is insane considering what the portion of the pasta dinners are!  The service is always Stellar!!!  See posted pics! Enjoy!",

The meatballs are so good and they fit the entire bread as they were really big.  I was only able to eat 2 of the 4 slider so I will have the rest later.  The garlic parmesan fries were good but they just don't give you enough because I am big french fry person.

Also was waiting 15 min before they took our drink order.  When pizza came we just took it to go.   I told girl in front counter my concern and she just smirked and brushed me off.  I'm still bitter about it.  I do believe they are prejudice at this location.  I loved the Metro at Ellis Island and the location at tropicana completely turned me off from the Metro brand!",

    "text": "This is my favorite location in the city.  1, because it is the one closest to my brother's house, and 2, it is just far enough away from the strip to be devoid of most tourists.  I've eaten here over a dozen times and somehow never had to wait.   I first found out about this place from my neighbor, Casey, who I owed a favor.   I asked if he wanted anything from The Vegas, and he said a loaf of bread from Metro Pizza.   It was the beginning of the end.  The crust is thick-ish, which is usually not my style, but the taste of the crust is absolutely magical.  It is the same as the bread, which is also amazing.   They give you some of this bread, toasted to perfection, while you wait for your food to come.  I haven't had a bad pizza here.  They have the option of pre-fab specialty pizzas like the New Orleans (shrimp, garlic, roma tomatoes) or the Napa Valley (white pizza with zucchini and proscuitto), or stuffed pizzas, or you can build your own (my poison of choice being pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives, extra sauce).  In addition to being a ranch lover, I am also a sauce whore.  I ask for extra sauce and they always give it to me, and it is delicious!!  I have never had anything but excellent service here, including nice chat from servers, and even once, when I was in a HUGE hurry, having them pack up three loaves of bread for me (after a short and efficient phone call) so that I was able to run in, throw my money on the counter, grab, the bag, and go.   A word of warning (and the ONLY reason this place doesn't get 5 stars), for some reason, this pizza is at its best in the restaurant.  It doesn't hold up as well as take out, and it doesn't reheat very well.  I don't know what it is about it....but it makes me sad because it is SO GOOD as dine in pizza, and I love to stretch my meals.  I'm not saying I won't take it home, reheat it, and eat it...but it really just isn't as good.   It is still some of my favorite pizza in the world, and when I am in town, I always make a stop here.",

I'm still searching for the right pizza..and haven't found one in Las Vegas anyway.  I had the Modesto specialty pizza that had roasted mushrooms, garlic, roma tomatoes and sausage on it. The crust was my least favorite, I could taste the oil on the bottom-other than that it was just ok.",

The first time I ate here it reminded me of the taste I was used to getting in my home town of Chicago. The sauce they use is second to none. The sausage is perfect. My wife loves the mushrooms. Usually before the pizza arrives they bring you some bread and butter appetizer to snack. I usually order my pizza about 10 minutes before we arrive at this location and it is waiting for us. Have gotten to know Ann one of the managers there over the years and she always takes care of us. Always greets us with a smile. Our last few trips I have ordered a side salad for starters and their house Italian dressing is outstanding. Monday thru Thursday between 2:30 and 4:30 all pizzas eaten inside are half off. The best pizza in Vegas as far as we are concerned. The inside of the place could use some upgrades but other than that this place is a gem.",

    "text": "Metro pizza has been around since I moved here almost 20 years ago.  They've always had extremely good quality for a reasonable price.  The two locations I've been to have a New York style decor and a very friendly environment.  Recently, a couple co-workers and I decided to order from there for lunch.  I chose one of the stuffed pizzas called \"The Loop\", which references Chicago deep dish pizzas.  However, their stuffed pizzas are nothing like deep dish pizzas from Chicago.  From the description on the menu, this calzone-like dish comes with sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms, and cheese (all my fav pizza toppings) stuffed inside a doughy shell.  When the delivery guy showed up I was starving and couldn't wait to dig in.  Upon opening the mini pizza box, I found exactly what the description foretold.  This thing was so big (I got the smaller sized one) that I could only eat half.  It also comes with your choice of dipping sauce, marinara or meat.  However, it is ridiculously greasy.  So much so that it bled through the box and even through the wax paper underneath it.  Overall it was excellent.  It was even good the next day since I only ate half.  Additionally, I highly recommend the parmesan-romano fries.  It's just french fries, but they cover them in the above mentioned cheeses and fresh garlic.  They come served with ranch.",

Not worth the calories. I ordered wine, chicken wings and a pizza. Husband ordered a pizza. He said his was good but not enough sauce or cheese. The wings were not crispy and not spicy at all. Then my pizza came so much after my husbands he had finished his by the time mine arrived. I also wanted a second glass of wine and had to call someone over to order it. If I were a server I would be all over the wine. It is the fastest way to up the bill and increase the tip. It seems this happens frequently that they keep the soft drinks full but never ask about wine. Anyway it was just OK here. May go back for the low carb pizza which we didn't end up getting.",

The service is a bit slow but its not like you're at Lil Ceasers, good pizza takes time.  They have a great seletion of beers to choose from and the prices are decent.  The Tropicana and Maryland Parkway location is pretty nice id suggest that one.  The Decater and Flamingo location is a smaller venue but the quality of the food is still the same.

The crust is also very yummy...We added meatballs to half and loved it. The small size was only $12.50 and we had that for dinner and lunch the next day.   The garlic fries were pathetic.

We usually go during 1/2 price time and the quantity of toppings and overall quality are never skimped on.  Same as their full price pizzas.

The thing that gets me every time is the house salad dressing. I need to find out if it's made in house or purchased because that stuff is delicious. I always use the bread that comes with my lunch special to soak up any remaining dressing. Mmmm.   I have been to Metro a couple times with co-workers and shared some appetizers. The only one that stands out is the nuclear fries. They aren't messing around, those bad boys are hot. Or I am a wuss. Or both.

While we were waiting for the pizza's to get done we where at the bar. One of he pizza's was not made how it was ordered And it had to be remade.  There was no bartender on duty. And A employee refilled our pitcher that was grate we had appreciated it. We were halfway through the Second pitcher we  a another employee walked up to the bar and accused us of pouring our 2nd pitcher.  Choosing us of stealing it was very disrespectful. We still had a half a pitcher we weren't going anywhere we were watching the football game. We went to the manager to complain about this issue.  He tried to make it better saying that he would take care of the second pitcher. At this point The issue was closed. We then returned to the bar. shortly after the manager reapproached saying he called the cops on us. And created a new conflict. The manager was clearly upset that his staff messed up the first order and was disrespectful.  Instead of excepting the truth. The manager then then shut off the game verbally attacked us And had a formed as they had called the police.   Quite shocking for a manager to respond this way and make a bad situation 100 times worse. He used all kinds of profanity. While he was talking to us. Even though we did nothing wrong I told my friends that we need to go. No more reason for more conflict.  There was no reason to get the cops involved. So we left peacefully with no other conflicts.   This has just been a shocking and horrible experience.   If I could put -5 stars I would!",

    "text": "So when my gf and I were in Vegas a couple weeks ago, we were craving pizza, but at the same time, didn't want to drive all the way to Henderson for Montesano's (still my favorite pizza in Vegas).  I checked out Yelp and this place popped up. I didn't realize that they're a chain until we got here. We ordered two large one topping pizza's to go. One with mushrooms and the other pepperoni, both very very good! I don't know if they have thick crust, but ours were on the thinner side.  I wasn't really paying attention, but since we were staying on the strip, their location inside Ellis Island would've been a little closer to us.   One thing about the place; our total came out to $30 bucks plus tax for two large one topping pizzas, I don't know I think that's sort of on the high side for to-go pizza.",

    "text": "With half an hour to kill and a hankerin' for some greasy pizza, I walked into Metro Pizza one afternoon to grab a bite.  After having a hostess ask \"For you?\" when I told her I was looking to get some lunch, I was seated at a table with a checkered tablecloth reminiscent of every other pizza joint I've ever been to.  What wasn't familiar, though, was the bizarre decorative choices made in this restaurant, seemingly in the late 80's (which was likely also the last time they cleaned the walls). Imagine cotton-candy blue and pink pastels, and then imagine that they somehow devised a way to make these colors less vibrant. Throw in some neon tubes and a horribly-misplaced wooden wine rack for good measure, and you've got Metro Pizza.  Confusing decor aside, I expected a good meal based on my experiences at the Tropicana location. An individual cheese pizza took them a satisfactory amount of time to cook and serve to me, and the staff's disposition was sufficiently cheery (though the bowtie on one of the waiters was a bit creepy). Grease dripping from the folded slice in my hand, I said a quick prayer and took a bite.  When I said up top that I wanted some greasy pizza, perhaps I should have been a bit more careful what I wished for. The river that slopped out of this slice of pizza would be enough to clog the arteries of an elephant. Despite the liberal application of pizza grease to this concoction, it didn't taste bad. I likened it to a less-disgusting version of Pistol Pete's (or Chuck-E-Cheese's) pizza, which I always thought was half-decent.  If you didn't stop reading my review after that last statement, thanks.  I finished my pizza (which must mean it's not that bad, right?) and settled my check, then headed out the door. I left disappointed -- and wanting a shower -- not necessarily because of the food itself (which would merit three stars on its own) but more by the general nastiness and creepiness of the establishment that I had just given twelve dollars.  The first thing Metro Pizza needs to do is take everything out of the place and paint the whole thing one color (and not in pastels, please). The cotton-candy walls and columns made my teeth hurt. Also, lose the neon. Nobody likes neon anymore, especially when it matches the pastel walls.  Let a bit more light into the place, mop the floors and wipe down the walls every now and then, and they'll have a nicer restaurant on their hands. I can't make a better pizza so I can't tell them how to change theirs, but less gut-busting grease would be nice.  If you're going to go to Metro Pizza, go to the one on Tropicana and Maryland. Let this one either realize the mistakes its making, or let it die the death it should have had years ago.",

The poor girl who seated us had to take our order and bring our check and another guy dropped off our pizza. Odd.  Pizza had a limp crust and all of the toppings literally slid off the slice when you picked it up.  So weird.  Not to mention the fact that this place looks like it popped out of a 1990 time machine. Think of the restaurant that the kids from Saved By The Bell used to hang out in.  That's this place!",

Also I forgot to pack my vacation silverware and asked if they could provide and they agreed. However when the items arrived there was everything under the sun accept silverware.   FOOD: Calzones have ricotta cheese in them which isn't listed on the menu. They give you a generous size pie but its greasy as hell. Yes yes i know its pizza greasy is to be expected but I never have had a calzone so greasy before. Crust was nice and golden! If it wasn't for the silverware I'd give it a 3 stars... Also missing was 2 sides of ranch. Overall poor experience",

The thick square cut pizza was the perfect later-that-night-alcohol-soaker-upper. The salad with the pears and candied nuts exceed my expectations of salad meant for a large group (AKA- no iceberg here with fatty ranch dressing here), and the antipasta platter had it all (calalmata olives, artichoke hearts, meats and cheese).  Put aside that the food was tasty- it was ridiculously affordable. Sixteen of us ate to our hearts' content for $15 each.  That's UNHEARD of for a dinner in Las Vegas. AND we ate plenty later that night as well. Metro Pizza did a great job helping us gage it so that we could have leftovers.   Definitely recommending this to any dear soul throwing a Bachelorette/Bachelor party (like Courtney, hi Courtney)...",

With that being said, if you don't have any taste buds, you enjoy the stinch of nasty carpet, and if subpar pizza is your favorite then this is the place for you.   We ordered the Metro pizza and it's supposed to come with extra cheese. If that was extra cheese then I guess regular cheese would be equivalent to a sprinkling of salt from \"Salt Bae\". The sauce tasted like tomato sauce straight from the can with ZERO Italian seasonings. Unfortunately, we were unable to finish the first slice beyond 2 bites.   The ONLY reason I gave 2 stars is because our waitress was very nice and accommodating.",

The salad was actually big and their homemade Italian dressing is delicious. I also recommend the ranch dressing. The cheese pizza was perfect. Thin crispy crust with lots of cheese. They also bring hot fresh bread.  My server was great. I didn't get her name but she was super attentive and quick.   They do some really awesome specials throughout the month and giving you a promo calendar when you sit down.   Ever Tuesday they do buy one get one on different items.

    "text": "Another Metro Pizza location, and another great pizza dinner!  I began with a very good bowl of old-fashioned Minestrone Soup with shredded Mozzarella Cheese that was chockfull of green beans, okra, broccoli, carrots, peas, Lima Beans, Kidney Beans, celery, cauliflower, White Onions, potatoes, and rigatoni.  That's a mouthful of ingredients, and each mouthful was packed with vegetable goodness.  A Small Dinner Salad was also a nice preliminary course, with Iceberg Lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, pepperoncini, croutons, and zesty housemade red-tinged Italian Dressing.  I tried to avoid the excellent crusty Pizza Dough and butter that was set before my party, but only had enough willpower to stop after downing four sumptuous butter-slathered slices.  I ordered a large pizza with four toppings: pepperoni, cooked tomatoes, mushrooms, and sausage.  My New York style pizza was bubbling and smoking hot when it arrived, with the cheese perfectly melted on top, and the dough suitably supple for slices to be easily lifted by hand and guided to a welcoming mouth.  The pepperoni and sausage were both on the mild side but with just a little kick.  It was excellent saucy pizza.  Diane's large Ham Pizza with extra cheese was also naturally cheesy and delicious.  Surprisingly, even with everything else I had to eat, I devoured all but three slices of my pizza at the restaurant--which left less leftovers to look forward to for lunch the next day.  When that time came, the slices heated up well in the oven, and tasted just as good as when my pizza was originally served.  Service was good, except I was initially erroneously charged for a lemonade that I was never served.  I was merely adding my own flavor drops to water.  The mistake was quickly and amiably rectified.   4-1/2 stars overall on this pizza quest!",

She was short with us the whole time we were there. Not friendly at all. Yet she was chatting it up with the table right next to us for about 5 minutes after she took our order. Maybe they were her friends. Who knows? But the thing that really made me mad is she purposely made jokes about \"raiders fans\" talking extra loud so my boyfriend can hear. I know she saw the raiders hat he was wearing. She just finished taking our order then went on to the next table and started making jokes about the exact team he was wearing. I just think that's rude and NOT professional. I don't care how you feel about the raiders!   For the rest of the time there she just ignored us. She looks at my empty drink (I saw bc we made eye contact), walks past twice but never said/did anything. We couldn't even get a refill until we asked.   The point is, we did not receive the same level of service she was giving the other table RIGHT NEXT TO US!   My boyfriend wanted to leave her .20 tip but I felt bad so we left her $2. I still don't feel she deserved it though. I just hate not tipping.",

I am only holding out because we have a Tony's Little Italy Pizza in Placentia, Ca. that ranks a 10 in my book.  We have been coming here for years, whenever we find ourselves in Las Vegas.  I think this may be the original location.  There is a decent amount of seating, not really huge, and bright, cheerful, NY ambiance.  We usually order the extra thick crust, but we were trying to cut down our carbs this time around, so went with a thin crust.  I loved it's thin \"crustiness\"  with cornmeal base, and would definitely do it again.  But....our real downfall was the fresh out of the oven, hot Italian bread with sesame seeds.  Fabulous tasting, it has a crumbly crust and the most tender insides you can imagine. They brought out a soup bowl of their amazing marinara sauce (I ended up drinking it like soup when everyone else was done) for dipping, and lots of butter.  I think I like the less acidic marinara even better than the pizza sauce.  Either way, you will be tripping over your feet trying to come back just for that.  The good Italian sausage with fennel seed, cheese, pepperoni, and fresh mushroom is our standard order.  It never disappoints.  A large size gives you 8 large slices.  They kept the Coke coming, and it was free with a Yelp check-in.  Even refilled our marinara bowl.  Such piggies we were.  No leftovers.   We walked away full and happy, 4 of us for ~ $30 including one generous glass of house red wine for Mr. B.   Happy to share this with you!",

Picked up my order. These were the worst I have ever gotten. Not much chicken plus overdone and greasy. Supposed to be broccoli in there. 1 piece in one 0 in the other. One half piece of sliced tomato per salad. I can not believe they put these in a bag and out the door. I just can't believe this is a new normal.  If smaller portion is for cost savings they just lost a lot because they have lost a years long customer. Someone should check the to go orders before they are handed to customers.",

    "text": "Solid 3 star experience for me.  Not amazing, but definitely not bad.  I'd be happy to return, or even order for pickup/delivery.  We walked in at about 7:00pm on Friday night for date night, and were seated right away.  The place itself is a little worn down, but still clean, and comfortable.    Service was...strange. We were seated by a friendly girl, and then a young guy in a tuxedo shirt and bowtie came over to get our drinks...when we gave him our coupon for free meatball sliders, he became a bit confused, and had to get the manager, who took care of us for the rest of the night...but the guy in the bowtie kind of...hovered around the table, almost like he wasn't sure what he was supposed to be doing... The manager was very nice though.  We waited about 20 minutes for the food, which isn't a bad wait.  The food LOOKED amazing.   The Meatball Sliders:  meatballs, sauce and cheese served on a garlic knot with french fries.  Whoever came up with the idea to do a slider on a garlic knot...well, they're a genius, and I want to kiss them.  What a great idea! For me, the meatballs could have been seasoned just a touch more, but they were pretty good.  Very heavy.  I only had one (and it happened to be the only slider on the plate that was DRIPPING in grease), and was pretty much done eating.  Pantheon Pizza:  White pizza with Garlic cream sauce, Mozzarella, chicken, spinach and feta.  YUM.  Absolutely delicious.  The only issue with this, is that the pizza was not cooked evenly...my two pieces had crust that was solid and crisp.  Morgan's 2 were soggy.   The flavor was really good, but we'd have liked to see a little more consistency with the cooking.   All in all, the meal was good.  The flavors were there, and service was pretty good.  I would definitely go back again.",

Came here for their Three Square event which all the proceeds of their 1 dollar slice of pizza special went to this great charity. This is a great cause and this review has nothing to do with that charity. Coming in here, the place had sort of a retro look to it, sort of a 'Saved by the Bell' type of vibe. Super casual place.  On to the pizza. I thought it was ok, the pizza dough was good. I also thought that the sauce on the pizza was good as well. I wasn't a big fan of the cheese that they used. It seemed to separate a lot, and there was a pile of grease that had accumulated on top of the pizza. Now I have been to other Metro locations over the years. This was probably the first time I had seen this on their pizza. But other than that, it was fine.  I will continue to patronize Metro. They could have had just an off day or something. But generally, the pizza is excellent, probably some of the best I've had ever.",

Having said that this location's delivery service has much to be desired. My work has been getting Metro delivery every Friday for several months now. Sadly there is nothing I can do to prevent this from happening as the boss loves Metro.   From the very beginning we have had problems. Mostly with undercooked pizzas and employees getting sick. The past 3-4 weeks they have been significantly late or they forget things like salad which is all I eat now since getting sick. On top of it the delivery driver has a really poor attitude.  I'm very grateful for my boss providing lunches but this place is TERRIBLE and I would never recommend getting your party catered from Metro.   If you are metro management please note there is a huge reason your orders from us have gotten smaller.... most people are eating out instead of taking the free food.",

    "text": "Ever since college (early 1990s), I've been coming to this pizza chain. This may be the only one that has not converted to their newer, updated theme, like a family style pizza place. It's very 1980's in here. I totally agree with Blair B. on the decor looking like it came from \"Saved By The Bell\" set, bright colors, and geometric shapes paired with black and white print contrast.   Still my favorite place to get a pizza at a sit-down restaurant. My favorite remains to be be the \"Gotham\"- pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions. And then, to take some home, to have at another time, it's a treat. It's not as greasy as my husband's favorite, Pizza Hut. I've also had on the menu: the sandwiches (eggplant parmesan), salad (house), and the calzones (huge), too- which are all, very yummy too. What I always saw at the Trop location, was the huge pizza for takeout, I always wondered about that, I think that it's one topping, but I could be wrong.  This location is probably the smallest one, and so, it can fill up fast. But if you get there at the right time, your wait time (for a table and for your food) won't be so bad. Service was pretty good. The hostess was nice. But because it's a small place, there might be a wait for the restroom (single one).  Great pizza, good food, a trusted pizza chain restaurant. There is a reason why I've loved the Gotham pizza for so many years.",

As soon as we entered I got the reminiscent feeling of a old school diner feel.  Located a bit off the strip but definitely worth the drive.  We ordered three kinds of pizza, garlic fries, garlic knots, and the sangria.    The Stockyard stuffed pizza, Modesto specialty pizza, and the spring street east side pizza.  Three different kinds of pizza, all so big that I struggled to eat a slice of each.  I had to try them all since it looked and smelled so delicious when it was brought out.   It didn't just look and smelled good but it was actually really tasty.  Flavorful and fresh.  The modesto was the lighter one of the three and the stuffed pizza was pretty filling.  Wash it down with a cold cup of sangria, left us all full and happy.",

After I received my food, I proceeded to work where I opened my pizza box, only to find a pizza, NOT made to MY order... A little puzzled because I was the only to go order and no one new came into the establishment. To make matters worse, they slice their pizza into squares.

When we were seated initially, there was no silverware on the table and we had to ask two different people to get some. My boyfriend ordered the Gotham pizza and it came out cold and again was pretty bland. We only saw our server, Angela, twice throughout the meal. She took our food order then dropped the bill.

We had the Modesto ($25.95 for a large) - roasted mushrooms, garlic, roma tomatoes, basil, and sausage. The crust was crispy and chewy but the underside of the pie wasn't firm enough to hold up to the toppings that were on it. I loved the sausage on it and the fresh basil. The sauce wasn't very memorable.  We also got an individual cheese pizza ($7.75) that my kid loved. He liked it so much that he got mad at me for eating his left overs a couple days later.",

The pizza is still pretty good but the service could use some improvement. Good New York style pizza.  I called to place an order for pick up, when they answered I was asked if I mind holding, of course not. But 5 minutes later and I was still holding, my husband called on his cell while I was waiting, and she put him on hold as well but returned to take his order 2 minutes later, I was still on hold with my phone for 8 minutes!  Beware if you get pepperoni the pizza gets really greasy, especially if it's to go, on top and bottom. Pizza is a bit pricey.  Restaurant has out dated look. We usually get our food to go.",

It's fun and I appreciate that more so than places without any decorations. I'd also like to point out that service was awesome. Both the greeter and our waiter were very nice.   The pizza made me want to cry. For starters I appreciate that you can create whatever you want and we made one half of our pizza pepperoni, mushrooms and ricotta and the other half was ham, sausage and pineapples. When we went to pick up our slices, they both drooped (a lot, like half the slice). It was like eating wet and uncooked dough. Not only did that happen but the flavors weren't great either. Everything was bland. With each bite I regretted the carbs. Finished my slice and just felt sad.   So I ask myself on every sad review, what was good? My free Coke with a yelp checkin and the service. That's it and I have to say this was one of the worst pizza experiences ever.",

With that said, this pizza was VERY middle of the road, 'meh'. It wasn't atrocious, but after 7 years in Vegas and hearing about metro pizza, my mind is blown as to how such average quality pizza is a hit to the point of multi-store Las Vegas expansions.  The dough was extremely bland and needed a double proof, a bit of molasses and either some cornmeal or garlic sprinkle to make it stand out.  The sauce was tasteless and again, nothing special whatsoever.  The cheese they use was ultra cheap, substantially worse than the grande brand cheese (industry standard these days) and created an oil slick on the paper plate when folded in half and eaten NY style. I've had tons of good pizza made with marginal quality cheese like this when the sauce or dough were able to compensate but I couldn't find one redeeming aspect at Metro besides the friendly service.  With such a mediocre interpretation of New York style pizza, Nobu should offer up a sword to fall on.",

Hells yes. Sign me up. Plus it is to benefit 3 Square Food Bank. Cheap pizza and it helps charity. Win and win. Plus hanging out with a few, or more than a few, friends. Bonus win.  I think I had Metro Pizza maybe once before tonight. And I had never been to the restaurant. This location has a cool 80s retro vibe. Maybe its a little dated but who cares. I dig it and the music matches. Plus the pizza is A-OK.   Tonight I ordered three slices of pepperoni. That is three slices of thin, wide, greasy NY style pie just the way I like it. Add some sprinkle cheese, some red pepper flake and a dash of garlic salt. You will not be sorry.  There is a full menu of other foods to choose from so check that out too.

A few years ago, my husband and I went in for lunch, got seated and waited 25 mins for a server to talk to us. Never happened, so we left. Based on that experience we never went back, because my husband wasn't having it.   Well, finally got him to give it another shot. What a disappointment. Ordered the baked ziti. Got a microwaved plate of crusty cheese and crunchy ziti. Our friends who were with us, ordered a pizza and I stole a slice because dammit I was hungry. The pizza wasn't any better! Tasted like really cheap cardboard! What happened to this place? It used to be so great. It makes me really sad how downhill the food has gone. The only reason it's even getting one star is for the salad house italian dressing. Shame..",

Always wanted to try them though, so I was excited to order through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgrubhub.com&s=c077f445c0f58c01f902dcc624c9eabb729cc1501e9105e88f0c900f5943d1fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">grubhub.com</a>.     We ordered two small pizzas, one pepperoni and one supreme, a pepperoni with extra cheese calzone, a chicken parmigana sandwich, a eggplant parmigana sandwich and an order of garlic balls.   The garlic balls were YUMMY, smothered in garlic and their oil. The only other items I got to try next was the calzone and the eggplant parmigana sandwich. The calzone was really good, I loved that it's packed full of ricotta cheese. The eggplant sandwich was just okay, the eggplant didn't seem too ripe so I wouldn't order it again. Something to take note of though, my co-worker, who has frequented Metro Pizza a lot in the past, made the comment that the pizza wasn't the same quality as before.     The girl on the phone and our delivery driver was both really polite and helpful. If we go with them again for lunch I won't be getting their eggplant.",

    "text": "Previous visits I had sliders and salads, but lately I've been eating from the pizza portion of the menu exclusively. The rumors and ratings are right: this place has fantastic pizza. Multiple crusts to choose from, several specialty options, but almost everything I've tried has been great.  The Modesto is my favorite: roasted mushrooms, garlic, and roma tomatoes, with fresh basil. And you can add sausage for FREE. Who has ever heard of that?! So props for having legit vegetarian options, and for kicking them up another level with the carnivore customization option. The small is perfect for two, add on some wings or a salad and you won't do too much damage to your diet.  The stuffed pizzas are also a hit- I'm not a fan of carbs on carbs on carbs, but BF would consider selling one of his kidneys for a large Loop (sausage, pepperoni, roasted mushrooms). The marinara dipping sauce is robust and comforting, but the crust is a bit too thick for my personal liking. I will say that the large, 8 slices for $30, is a great deal if you have a large group: similar, smaller, thinner slices in town go for $5/each elsewhere, and this averages out to under $4/slice with much better quality and a larger portion.  And service. It's always great. Phoning in my order is easy, it's always ready on time at pickup, and staff are friendly when I pop in. Bonus points for having the two takeout-pickup spaces in the parking lot!",

I had tried Metro pizza at work one day and it was great then, so a friend and I went to this location and it was really nice and the atmosphere was really fun kind of like an older diner setting. It was nice and the staff was really friendly and knowledgable of the food selection and was very tentative to drinks needing refilled and always checked on our table make sure we were satisfied, the pizzas are good and the their crust is soft, not like the kind you sometimes get the and crust is tough and hard, and its not even thin crust. I would like to go to their other locations around town and see how the other rank, I will definitely come here again and recommend others to come and try them out!",

While waiting, you can see the guy making hand tossed pizza from the splash screen as well! The decor is kind of like an 80's theme ish but it's cute.  To start off, fresh baked crusty bread was given and it was delicious! Soft on the inside and crusty and crispy on the outside! We ordered garlic knots, hot fries, and a half pepperoni pizza and sunchoke pizza! The crust to the pizza was nice and crispy- food was cooked to perfection! Garlic knots were nice and fluffy with the right amount of garlic! The hot fries were addicting and crispy- you can tell they were just right off the fryer!  Our server couldn't have been any more accommodating! We knew he was busy as he was running around the whole place but he was super sweet and still took care of us. I like this place better than some of the other larger chain pizzas and for sure I will be back again for more!",

    "text": "A few years back, a buddy/coworker of mine introduced me to this place as being the \"Best Pizza In Town\".. So one day we ordered a whole pie for lunch. He recommended to order a Large Pizza knowing we'll have leftovers. So we got the \"The Stockyard\" aka Meat Lovers..Came with Pepperoni, Sausage and Ground Beef. That thing was Stuffed with chunks of sausage and beef! Medium sized crust not super thin nor extra thick. Overall, didn't look that oily (considering all the toppings) and was Very Tasty and Very Filling.  No Comparison with the Big Chain Pizzas Meat Lovers!  I\"ve gone to 2 other locations since (boulder and tropicana). And this is what I had:  Garlic Romano Fries: wide fries with major crumbles of garlic and parmesan cheese. These were Awesome!  Cheese Pizza Slice: Decent size (not quite as big as Costco's slices), Thin NY Style, Sauce and Dough both on the sweet side and Cheese was quality you could taste and held together (stringy type).  The Gotham: pepperoni, mushroom, suasuge, green peppers, ground beef and onions. Love the toppings, exactly what I would add on my pie (if it wasn't plain cheese or pepperoni)! Everything Quality and Amount of Toppings So Generous..   Service was fine (decatur & boulder) and Prices Fair.. Boulder location is quite small, like a shop you'd find in a foodcourt of a mall, with some tables scattered in front  of it). The Decatur location is more of a dine in restaurant outfitted with a Radical Vintage/Retro theme. So far, its been One of the Few Pizza Joints I wouldn't mind paying another visit..",

    "text": "The wife and I recently embarked upon a quest to find our perfect pizza in Las Vegas.  I'm Australian and the wife grew up in Michigan and neither of us are fans of the two most prominent styles of pizza available in town - New York Style and Chigaco style.  I posted a thread on the discussion forums here detailing my preferences when it comes to pizza and a few people suggested Metro pizza and their \"metro crust\" as possibly satisfying our needs so we decided to give it a try.  The restaurant seemed very pleasant, but we decided on take-out. I ordered a large \"Gotham\" minus the mushrooms and my wife, ironically, ordered a plain cheese with mushrooms. Both were metro style and we were very encouraged watching our nice puffy looking pizzas come out of the oven.  When we got home we discovered that Metro Pizza is getting close to what we are looking for, but still isn't quite on the money. The real strength of metro is the superior quality of the toppings. They are absolutely delicious.  The crust is also tasty, but I sort of wished it wasn't quite so thick on the outside and wasn't quite so thin in the middle - perhaps a uniform thickness throughout.... Like many pizza places around town, the pizzas are a bit wet for my tastes and slices tend to point straight down to the ground when you pick one up rather than exhibiting any sort of backbone. This is a shame because the crust has a pleasantly chewy texture that I enjoy. If they could somehow cut the wetness about the interior of the pizza this would be a real winner.  Overall Metro Pizza is probably going to satisfy the majority of pizza fans in Vegas, particularly those with tastes less exacting than my own. It wasn't quite the crust we were looking for, but the quality of the toppings makes for a delicious taste that will surely call us back for repeat visits - at least until we find the holy grail of Vegas pizza.",

    "text": "This is both a good and bad review.  Over all we loved the pizza, not the service.  Read more if you like for further detail.  I went here last night hoping to find better than Papa John's and as far away from Northside Nathan's Detroit Pizza as humanly possible.  I've got to say, I really like pizza at Metro.  Although I live in Las Vegas now, I am originally from Rhode Island.  My all-time favorite pizza has always been A-1 Pizza in Newport, RI.  I guess some of my friends would say I'm difficult when it comes to eating out with me.  It's just I expect a lot when I'm dining out.  Something more than I would make for myself at home and service to match.  If that makes me \"difficult\" then so be it.  I've always been a fan of huge toppings and mondo amounts of cheese so I ordered the Metro Pizza with extra cheese on top and added zucchini and spinach.  I'm also a big eater so I figured I'd order a side of hot wings as well.  While they came to the table temperature hot and looking  great, I didn't care for the sauce.  It was vinegary and not spicy hot at all.  I'd asked them to make them as hot as possible.  I guess they just don't have the means to make them any hotter than you'd get with a standard hot sauce from a bottle.  They were maybe just a little under cooked as well.  Everyone likes a crispy wing right?  Requests them extra crispy and you may find them passable.  My partner ordered a small Stockyard stuffed pizza and it looked amazing and he stated that he'd enjoyed it very much.  Noting that the sweet Italian sausage was plentiful and yummy.  All in all, I'd have to say it was a good night for food at Metro.  I will be back to try more of their delicious pizza to be sure.  Okay, now the bad... The service was poor.  Just to give an example and not dwell on it too much I'll just tell you a few points they stick out 23hrs latter.  We sat with empty glasses for 20min till I asked for assistance from a second passing water.  No suggestions were offered and when asked about the different crust options it looked to us like she's grown tired of that same question from every dang customer and offered very little help or sympathy for two proclaimed \"first timers'.  No suggestions were given or up-selling suggested for that matter.  No one ever smiled and when our pizza was ready to be brought to the table it looked as if our waitress was debating with the other water who helped us as to who wanted to bring the pizza to out table (the second water was nominated).  We shared the last napkin at the end of the meal just not wanted to bother with her again.  The friendliest conversation we had with our waitress was the 10 second attempt at influencing her tip upon laying the bill on our table.  I thought the prices were maybe a little high for what we got, but they do have a special going on that attempts to those on a budget.  Mon-Thu 2:30-4:30pm is HALF OFF all pizza!  I'm liking that and at that price I'm still giving them 4 stars with horrible waitressing being my only real complaint.",

We went during happy hr when They had half-price pizzas which made it a really good deal. three adults got individual pizzas and an appetizer of cheesy bread and all for 25 bucks, we aren't locals to Las Vegas but we visit often and will definitely make sure that we come back to one other locations that they have.",

When you go in, it looks like someone either misses the 80's or they built that place in 1985.    Even though it's not deep_dish (somehow reviews say it's that, but it's not ), this was good.  The key was the dough.  When we got the little garlic rolls, and they had that good 'doughy smell, I couldn't wait for the pizza.  Very soft, chewy, and tasty.    We got the salad and a large stuffed pizza.  Somehow I'm not good at size estimation, because this pizza was probably for 6 people, not three.  We had like half the pizza left!    Will definitely go again, just to try a different (and smaller) pizza.  Good Value, good pizza, great for what it is.... Yeah I think I'll give it 5.",

    "text": "Ordered the The Skyline. My roommate and I used to live in Chicago so we know pizza pie. We ordered it carryout; the wait was very short (only 15minutes) so I kind of knew right away it wasn't the real deal thick crust stuffed Chicago-style pizza (which take no less than 45 minutes) but we gave it a shot. The dough was tasty, and they did not short us on any ingredients. The pizza was cooked perfectly with a nice crispy crust yet warm doughy center. Overall we were satisfied with the taste. Only set backs: the crust was not deep dish, the pizza itself was very wide for Chicago-style, and the meat sauce to put on top was very thin (almost like college dorm quality spaghetti marinara sauce). It was almost like a cross between Chicago and New York styles.   If you have the munchies for a quick all-American pizza, go here. The staff were very friendly as well.",

    "text": "Sometimes I think I would rather talk about circumcision or which is the best web browser or perhaps whether Deckard was a replicant than try to have a sane conversation about pizza.  I don't know what it is about people that makes them lose all logic and diplomacy when it comes to pizza. Say you don't like New York-style pizzas, for example, like the way some people don't like charcoal grills or folk jazz but are still respectable citizens, and it's like the entire eastern seaboard will hop on a bus to your humble opinion on the internet and burn it for heresy. It's no better with Chicagoans, either. People have *strong* opinions about pizza that tend to manifest as The One True and Only Way.  Me, I've discovered I can appreciate all styles. I thought I hated New York-style until I tried Grimaldi's. I found Chicago-style to be a hot mess until I made my own at home. Sicilian? Detroit? CPK? They all have their merits.  Metro Pizza is after my own heart in this way in that they offer several different types of pizza on both their carryout and dine-in menus. Now we all can be happy! (And take that first step toward peace, which begins with admitting that more than one type of pizza exists.) I was most encouraged by their \"Metro crust,\" a thick crust option that I hoped would take me back to, well, most of the pizza I had before moving to Las Vegas (land of the floppy and greasy slice... and that's okay... for other people).  The first time we had Metro I closed my eyes in joy. Not perfect, but so much closer than most places. Finally!  The second time, same deal, although the flaws (as I see them) seemed to interrupt my bliss more this time.   The third time... um, what happened? (But edible.)   The fourth time we threw most of two large pizzas away. (And people, I seldom walk away from any combination of bread and cheese.)  Oh, Metro.  I think everyone needs to try Metro Pizza. They are immensely popular, and if my friends are any indication, odds are you will be very pleased with what they do and how they do it.  The staff at the Decatur location is extremely friendly. They usually offer us sodas while we wait for pick-up, so I feel like a big jerkface to criticize them now. But, I write the type of reviews I want to read, and when I'm considering pizza joints, I appreciate knowing whether I can expect a thick-crust pizza with good ingredients that isn't wet or greasy.  My standard order is a cheese with mushrooms plus Metro Crust. Right away, the first time I noticed that most of the toppings were in the center of the pizza. I don't know why this happens, but I never encountered it until I moved to Las Vegas. Here I see it All. The. Time.   I also determined that, dough-wise, I loved the outer third or so of the crust, but the middle was just too soggy for me. So, a little scooching of the toppings, and I had a good pizza, albeit with a strange, wet mucky circle of dough from the center left over. The cheese tasted bright (ugh, Food Network is rubbing off on me) and wasn't rubbery, and the mushrooms were hearty and not slimy.  But, as I said, things have been downhill over the past four months. The crust became more and more undercooked, the toppings didn't taste as fresh plus they congealed more and more into the center, and everything took on a greasy feel. We're talking back-of-the-throat acid before the first slice is done.  After the third time we said, you know, maybe we were wrong. It's just not our style after all. But the other day I had a craving for a thick crust, something the local Grimaldi's doesn't do, so back we went and, like I already described, it was so bad that we actually threw the pizzas away. Pizzas that I know so many other people would love. (Along with a batch of garlic knots that could've doubled as rocks should we have wanted to end the meal with some xeriscaping.)  If I had Metro Pizza before moving to Las Vegas (after a lifetime in the midwest and south), I'd give it a two at best. (Again, with guilt for downrating such nice people.) But now that I know that this is (it seems) what pizza is *supposed* to be like for some people, I don't know what to do.   Three stars, I guess, but it's really not \"A-OK\" with me.",

The toppings were excellent and the pre-meal table bread was even noteworthy.  Service was excellent, never had to ask for a refill. And they have daily specials for holidays, service workers, even for anyone with a certain name.   Overall, just a very cool local place that definitely has a good rep for its good eats. This particular location also has this cool 80s deco vibe that I really dig, and that's just gravy.  Check this place out! Best of Las Vegas for something like seven years running...and with good reason.  (Check in for a free soft drink, your entire party can check in and all get a free soda!)  We even came back a couple days later to eat again while we were still in town, turns out they don't open until 11, but they let us in 20 minutes early because they're just that nice.   A++ would dine again.",

I have met the owners, they used to be all about the pizza!  Now it is overpriced, the food does not have the same flavor. The italian sub I drooled for for two weeks and finally got? A HUGE oily disappointment. The sunspot pizza I bragged to out of town company about? Cold, with an undercooked center and sparse toppings.   The service? Last time I watched a table full of servers sit and have lunch with their manager, while we sat two tables away with no refills, food taking over a half an hour to come out after waiting a half an hour to order, and just in general a terrible time. When I told the server about it, she shrugged and get the manager who blew me off. I was presented with a check and I paid it, vowing never to return and feeling bent over and....well, ripped off I guess would be the point here.   I would have recommended this place in 1999... hell I wished I had money to invest in the idea when I first tried it. But now...now how you have strayed!!!",

    "text": "It was during the MAGIC Fashion Show I was first introduced to Metro Pizza.  My party was staying at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and was looking for something easy to pick up or delivery. I was charged with providing lunch, so I looked around the hotel-- to no surprise, many things in the hotel for was overpriced and of poor quality. In the search for help I went to Concierge service desk. After speaking with a Concierge, he recommended Metro Pizza for delivery. All I needed to hear was that Metro Pizza was featured on FoodNetwork as Vegas' top pizza place. I got their number and dialed away.   After half an hour post-order, the Pizza arrived at my suite on the 63rd floor of Mandalay Bay (some how the delivery man by-passed all the security). They told me that it would be forty five minutes to an hour, because of the heavy demand for pizza and traffic congestion that day, but I was glad they came earlier than planned.   I ordered two pans of pizza, both large size, one cheese and one combination. Both were terrific! The price may be somewhat steep, but for a delivery place outside of the hotel to deliver to your room and be the quality that it was is exceptional. (The pizza satisfied many palates that were present: Koreans from Korea, native New Yorkers, vegetarians from Florida, and picky eaters from California).  The pizza itself was different from those other pizza spots. The crust was crisp, but not difficult, the correct temperature for the cheese so it doesn't look like gruyere over french onion soup, and the more than generous portion for toppings that were very tasty.  I will definitely order from this place again in the future!",

For two salads the meatball sliders and two cannolis you're looking at about $50+tip. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is b/c I'm not that impressed with their pizza. It's \"okay\" and you can tell they use quality ingredients but I wasn't a fan of their crust. I like it puffy on the edges and thin in the middle and well done. If is sags when I fold it- it's not cooked enough...But that's just a matter of preference...  The interior at the Decatur loaction is horrible! And the bathroom is kinda gross. The handle seemed broken and could overall use a little dressing up. New paint and a few cosmetic upgrades aren't a bad idea.",

I do patronize the Tropicana, and Ellis Island locations, but this one is my favorite, for obvious reasons. Ann knows my name, whet I order, and EXACTLY how I want it prepared. I've introduced thousands to Metro Pizza, and have had a lifetime of memories in their restaurants. Chains with their assembly line pizza, and inferior ingredients, can't hold a candle to Metro. I want homemade. I want the best quality ingredients. I don't eat fast food pizza. I eat real pizza! By the way, check out their lunch specials, happy hour, and pizza dine in specials. It's the best pizza in Vegas.",

I don't know why there is such a huge discrepancy between the two different locations but I will stay clear of the southwest Decatur location. I'd rather starve than eat there. A total waste of my money and time to drive out there. Stick with the Skypoint location and enjoy some great pizza.",

The crust did not have the \"marshmallow\" texture, the sauce was not nearly as tasty and the cheese was absent as far as flavor.  Note we had quite a few drinks at that point, so it should've tasted better than that! We also ordered a small Metro.  This pizza had extra cheese, but most of it was burned.  We visited Rock Pizza on the first night here and it was significantly better with a better atmosphere.",

Yes I'm poetic about it because that's what this pizza is, worthy of poems! The crust is crispy with bit of chewiness where it matters. The sauce is tangy and not overly sweet, just the way it should be. Yes, real cheese (duh) and ingredients galore are all good.  The next best thing here are the garlic knot sliders. Little orbs of meaty love is what I call them. Highly recommended.  Never disappointed with the food here, and the staff is always friendly and service is fast.  By the way, for the at home chefs, you can buy dough and sauce here and give it a whirl at home. I've done it, not quite the same but close. Mostly because my GE oven doesn't quite compare to a commercial pizza oven...Still, worth a try.",

If you need to use the bathroom don't expect it to be clean.  The door knob had a booger on it and we decided to hold it.  **I was shocked to see an employee size up a group of customers.  I  watched him talk about them and laugh to a coworker.  I don't want to do business with anyone who treats customers like that! That is a \"NO NO\", especially in a bad economy.

    "text": "I attended a pizza making class at a different Metro location and learned in class that originally, Margherita Pizza did not have fresh tomatoes on it.  That made my heart sing. I hate fresh tomatoes, but love tomato sauce.  Take the class...it's fun, and loaded with food and drinks (including beer and wine) for a low price!   I also love a good paper thin crust pizza.  I ordered the Margherita pizza which comes on an ultra thin 12\" crust.  I added pepperoni and fresh garlic and asked for a well done bake.   Definitely the best pizza I've had in Vegas.  Yum.  I am hooked.  See the uploaded pics of the pizza.  I knocked off one star for the decor of this particular location.  It is such an eyesore and is long overdue for a remodel.  The pizza, garlic knots and cannoli are all worthy of 5 stars!",

Judging from the peeling walls, carpeted floors and location, this is definitely one of the older locations. But fellow patron, don't eschew it because of that; it's actually a glowing gem hidden amongst a dilapidated shopping plaza. No wonder it's beloved by Vegas citizens.  I ordered the Green Valley pizza but what came was Death Valley. The pizza was layered with lots of black olives and sun dried tomatoes. I asked for added broccoli, too. A pizza with an adjective green should be green, right? Not this one. I wanted to feast on a fucking evergreen forest. Nope, it was a vast black desert with patches of green. The ratio between canned and fresh cut veggies had to be 4:1. At least it tasted great and the service was prompt and kind. Next time I'm asking for no olives and sun dried tomato and extra zuchinni.",

Our table shared a giant ravioli, some salads, and chicken parmigiana. The items we ordered were pretty good, but most of the food is a bit overpriced. The pasta meals come with salads and are large portions, so if you're super hungry, the prices may be better for you. A personal 9\" pizza with any toppings will run you $12-$13.    We saw our waiter only twice in an hour, and none of the staff knew about the menu items. We had to go find someone to pay our check. The food isn't bad, but the dough is too airy and fluffy. I'd come here for some decent meat sauce and noodles instead of pizza.",

    "text": "Serving Las Vegas for nearly forty years one might assume Metro Pizza has the delivery game down to a science, but by utilizing a central phone number and e-mail specifically for catering John Arena and Sam Facchini's Pizzeria goes one step further than most to assure seamless customer service.  Featuring locations North, South, East and West, attentive staff acting as triage to assure timely arrival of Food, utensils, plates and condiments, it was on the first day of May that #supportlocal once again received everything ten minutes early with staff ready to dig in.  Suitable for almost any budget, paper or online menus offering a wide range of family-size dishes in addition to Pizzas, it was deferring the order largely to Metro that five Pies plus Bread, Pasta, Salad and Dessert were received for under $15 per guest, the all-inclusive cost predictably yielding enough for all plus plenty of leftovers.    Now the eighth time delivering to this office, in addition to a dozen or more visits to locations on Decatur or Sky Pointe, it was beginning with Salad that many once again praised Metro's duo of housemade Dressings, though those more concerned with eating while Food was still temperature appropriate predictably went straight for the recently launched \"Zamboni\" Pizza complete with two Meats, Roasted Peppers and a generous drizzle of Hot Honey.   Moving next to Meatballs, the combination of Pork and Beef with almost no binder predictably dense and rich in contrast to tangy Tomato Sauce, it is no surprise that Metro's all-new Rigatoni with Sausage, Peppers and Onions also performed beautifully amongst a staff that frequently gravitates towards pronounced spicing and big flavors.   Not about to pass by 86th Street, the cold-fermented Crust remaining defiantly light despite its thickness even after traveling ten miles, the choice between Vodka and Red Sauce really comes down to personal preference, as too does whether or not Chicken and Feta \"belong\" on a Pizza, though considering the Pantheon was devoured in fifteen minutes it seems the answer is \"Yes!\"",

Upon entering it has unique purple luminescent lighting that gives it a retro feel. It was cute!   I came on a Tuesday which they do half off appetizers. We got the garlic knots, calamari, and Spinach artichoke dip. The garlic knots were pretty standard. The calamari was good but seemed to have more batter then actual calamari and very small pieces. But the star of the appetizer show was the spinach artichoke dip with buttery bread!   As if we didn't overload on carbs already we also ordered a small 'Honolulu' pizza and a large custom pizza (pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapenos).   I tried 1 piece of the custom pizza. I thought it was pretty good!   I have my usual go to pizza spots, and also I usually like getting my pizza delivered.. but I would recommend this place to others if they like a good sit down spot to enjoy pizza.   I gave this place 3 stars just for the overall average score for quality, price, and service as a whole.",

We walked in to order take out with our two children, there was a lady sitting at the bar area right next to the register just playing on her phone (maybe the manager not really sure) she continued to sit in that same spot almost the whole 25 mins while we waited for our food even though they were really busy and she was just in the way. She was very rude and every time my toddler would be a little loud playing with his brother she would glare at us. Kids will be kids, we attempted to shush our kids several times, they weren't being bad just playing with each other. She finally moved to a table out of the way when it got super busy in there.   The pizza was not that great it had grease puddled all over the pizza by the time we got home which was 2 mins away.   With the atmosphere and the gross pizza we won't be returning, and not to mention the cost of the pizza was ridiculous!!",

The prices were little too high for the quality of the food and location. The place was very retro!  The reason for my 1 star review is while my family and I were dinning and we were seated towards the back of the restaurant. On the floor was a DEAD RAT and looked like the tail of the rat was stucked on the foot of the table and was not able to get away. It was a disgusting and horrifying site! My 2 year old daughter that happened to drop her toy saw this DEAD RAT. We just left after that. There is absolutely no turning back or no words for a DEAD RAT in a restaurant. EVER! Dirty dining you Definitely need to check this place out for everyone's sake.",

It wasn't that busy but it still took longer than expected to get our food. I don't know if it felt like a long time because I was starving but I think it was because it took longer than needed. This was weird because all the other times I went the service was fine. Maybe because it was almost closing time but still annoying. Despite the food taking forever it was worth it. We ordered the meatball sliders and the personal pan size of the Metro pizza with just cheese. The meatball sliders come on garlic knots which makes them amazing! The personal pan size was huge and enough to split for two people. Its thick pizza which is my favorite. Since cheese is my favorite the only thing I would add to the pizza is more cheese. I will definitely be ordering these again when I return.",

It worked out perfectly for our group.  All the food came out on time and though the servers were a bit slow with coming through to take drink orders, they were always nice and accomodatinig on anything we asked for.   The best part of any Metro Pizza is the freakin food!!  The pizzas here are always perfect.  The only one I was disappointed with was the supreme.  It came with WAY too many toppings, like giant chunks of hamburger.  BALANCE, people!!  A pizza needs some balance with it's toppings.  I basically picked off half the toppings and then it was perfect.  Next time, we'll stick to just one or two topping pizzas.  Don't forget to order garlic knots.  You won't regret it!

    "text": "Heard about this place from a radio station contest.   My hubby is from vegas so he had heard of them to but never ventured out to try it. Near flamingo and decatur with time to spare before my doctors apt we decided to take a chance and try it. Mind you i was 6 months pregnant! Going here i was so hungry and once i walked in i could smell the aroma of homemade pizza and pasta. I was in heaven! Looking at the menu we had a hard time making a decision. We decided to go with an app [buffalo wings] and a pizzza pie [it had sausage, mushrooms, and pepperoni inside] and a side of french fries. the service was great. waitress was friendly and explained the biggest hits on her menu.   The bus boy was great at refilling our drinks and they were never empty. i loved that. food came quicker than i thought since they did have a good amount of people there for a [monday] lunch hour.   The wings were delish and i could not get enough of them. The fries were a little to salty for my liking... but then again i grew up with a mom who never allowed us to use salt plus i was pregnant and my taste buds didnt like salt too much. Lastly the pizza pie was huge! def enough for atleast 4 people. we had sooo many left overs. i swear when i went to the doctor i had gained atleast 10 pounds.   we shall be back because the food was very good. very much reminded me of my hometown in cali where the pizza has lots of toppings and tastes homemade.  Great thing about this place is their are all about specials. Lunch specials. Specials on their calenders for every day (i.e on may 2nd if your names jacob you get a free pizza lmao. they also give half priced pizzas to those who dine in monday thru thurs from 3-5pm",

    "text": "Hey, Slater!  You wanna meet up at The Max after school?  We should totally study for the bio test before we wind up in detention with Belding.  ......oops sorry.  Just getting lost in my \"Saved by the Bell\" daydreams.  It always seems to happen when I go to Metro Pizza.  So if you're still confused, the inside of this place SCREAMS the diner that Zack and the gang would hang out at after school (you know, \"The Max\").  It certainly makes for an interesting dining experience.  1993 decor aside, let's get to the important information: the food.  I have had the garlic fries (yummy), the eggplant parm sub (not so yummy), and plain ol' cheese pizza (good).  One of the lunch specials is $10 and comes with a plain or pepperoni pizza (a little smaller than a medium at most other places) and a big salad.  I always have leftover pizza for dinner, so that's nice.  The bread and salad really aren't anything special when you think about it, but I love both.  The bread tastes like what some little grandma would make on a Sunday afternoon, while the salad is always a large serving of fresh veggies.  I highly recommend their house-made Italian dressing- I don't know what they do to it to make it taste so good, but I would like the recipe, please.  Most days, we get a large pizza that is half Thompson and half Mulberry.  The Thompson is spinach, garlic, and ricotta while the Mulberry is fried eggplant, ricotta, and fresh basil.  The pizza is a thinner crust but still doughy (not crispy) and it is huge.  Two slices and I'm done.  Our pizzas have always been cooked perfectly and there's always a good balance of cheese, sauce, and toppings.  Usually the toppings are tasty, however on our last visit- not so much.  The water wasn't squeezed out enough from the spinach (obviously frozen) and the eggplant was fried to a crisp.   The servers are friendly and usually our water glasses are kept full.  But for some reason everything is always SLOW.  I'm talking you may spend 2 hours here if it's a busy night.  The pizza is good, but prepared to spend some time in the restaurant.  I believe Metro is a Vegas institution that everyone should visit at least once.  I suggest this location in particular, so you can re-live all your bad memories of terrible neon outfits from the early 90's.",

Their lunch specials are a great deal. Unfortunately they aren't listed on the website, but off the top of my head they are $7.99 . They come with hot bread (as if you need bread to wash your pizza down with, but seriously it's some tasty bread!), a salad, a drink + a decent sized personal pizza.   As a bonus, if you're eating low carb or are on a diet, they have crustless pizza. I know it sounds ridiculous to order this, but for us dieters this can be a life saver! It's basically a tall pan filled with sauce, toppings and cheese. MMM. All the pizza taste with way less calories.",

    "text": "Now, is when I admit the ugly truth: I am not a pizza snob. I know I have been hiding behind a foodie cloak, albeit a discount foodie cloak, but I am pretty easy to please when it comes to a slice with cheese. (Couldn't resist the rhyme.) If the sauce has some kick and the toppings are not from a can, I am a star-giving fool!  With that off my chest, I would like to say that I really like Metro Pizza. However, I might add, that I think Metro could please even a foodie. I have been at least four times, and if I keep going back, something must be right.  The place looks like a 50s diner, and there are some rather uncomfortable booths in the back. Watch out for that. But, the servers are always nice, even when we show up right before closing.   They have a calendar of goofy specials that changes every month. Goofy specials include days when you can get 50% pizza if your name is Mina. (The name changes so don't go and change your name.) Also, they have an early bird special Mondays - Thursdays, 2:30pm - 4:30pm: Any Pizza, Any Size, Half the Price!  Now, as for the pizza, we always get thin crust. They bake the pies in a pizza pan that has knobs along the bottom (probably a technical term for this), and I think that helps create a beautifully crisp crust without excessive greasiness. The toppings are generous and fresh. We generally don't order one of the specialty pizzas; we just get the toppings we want. Man, I can't really think of anything to complain about here, but then again, I am no pizza snob. Which reminds me, have you tried the new Domino's? ;)",

So when I give a call back the lady was still super nice and she tried to say that she would give me some credit towards the store which did not interest me because I'm not from here I just said that I wanted a new pizza with more chicken on it. The lady spoke with her manager and then they agreed to give me a new pizza they said it would take about 45 minutes. The both of the pizzas were very good. They seemed very apologetic when my second pizza came it was very warm just like the first one but luckily it had more chicken. I would definitely recommend the place the food is super good the customer service is amazing definitely a thumbs up",

The Pizza was fantastic, some of the best I have ever had. (Thank you Vegas Yelpers for the tip!) The service was wonderful. Our server was a very active listener and from random conversation picked up that we were from out of town. I would recommend this place to anyone going to or living in Vegas. The pizza was just right not too saucy and not soggy. Great place for groups as well I was highly impressed. We went twice while we were there it was so good.",

If you are hungry or in a hurry it really sucks.  Thankfully the bread they serve you is super yummy (although I was almost full on the bread by the time the pizza came)....the pizza itself was fresh and tasty.  If their service was a little more on the ball (quicker and better) it would have gotten 5 stars.  Oooh I didn't try them but they did have red velvet whoopie pies!",

It is hard to describe, it has a thick light airy crust, like what the boarder crust is on a good pizza but its that way on the whole pie.  No matter what you order the pizza is tasty and a everyone I have ever taken there loves it, you can't go wrong.  They also bring you warm delicious french bread as you wait.",

    "text": "We ate here after my favorite pizza place, NY PIZZA AND PASTA at Jones and Sahara had a fire. I have read and heard mixed reviews of Metro Pizza but I knew it had been rated very high. We ordered their pizza and found the restaurant to be very clean and a nice place to hang-out and have pizza etc. They have a very nice selection of wine and beer and our server, Tony, was a very nice person and the service was good. I read somewhere people complained about bad service at one of their locations........not at Flamingo and Decatur......... the service and attitudes were fine. So as always we order the pizza\" Thin crust all the way to the edge with pepperoni and fresh garlic\". The pizza was good ..... in fact to be honest it was better than good but the sauce, cheese and especially the dough was not as good as my usual hangout. Don't get me wrong!..... If you go here you will be happy with their pizza if you order it the way I do......... Authentic NY style. This place is a nice hangout, clean and I would bring my kids here plus good food but just not as good as pizza( maybe 20% less satisfying)  when Brian at New York Pizza and pasta makes my pizza thin crust all the way to the edge with pepperoni and fresh Garlic. I am waiting  for their new location to open in the Northwest part of Vegas. I will give it a try again........ it's better than \"good\"",

When we first walked in, it took a while for someone to notice we were there and a bit longer to get seated even though it seemed like there were a lot of empty tables.  Our booth seats were half wet, half covered with crumbs. As soon as our food came, we didn't care about any of that.  And our servers at the table were really friendly.  They start you off with nice crusty bread and butter.  They have a 'barrel special' wine selection which that evening was a bottle of grenache for $12.  We shared a salad - can't remember the name that had walnuts, blue cheese, pears etc. - it was plenty for 4 people.  We had the Honolulu and the Sunspot pizzas - both were super yummy.  Honolulu was ham, pineapple, bacon bits (real ones) and bell peppers - we opted for no onion.  Sunspot was tomatoes, artichokes,spinach and basil - we opted for no garlic.  Two small pizzas were enough for the 4 of us.",

The cheese was not salty,the toppings were fresh, the crust was chewy and perfectly cooked, and it had just the right amount of sauce. The service was phenomenal, like how old vegas was 20 years ago. We have gone to soooo many pizza joints in vegas, and have always felt like something was off. We left Metro pizza with a big smile on our faces, and we couldn't wait to go home and share our left overs with our neighbors.",

I've had better food at a hospital honestly. Our waitress had ZERO personality and she looked like she would have rather been anywhere else but work. It's hard to be so critical because we own restaurants here in the valley as well and we fully understand, we still tipped over 20% but only ate 5% of our food. Whomever your manager/owner is needs to get the ship back on course, staff, food and ambience are all severely lacking. Compared to your other locations, this is by far your weakest.",

    "text": "Maybe it's just me, but Metro's pizza is just OK. I am not too sure why everyone raves about it. It is good, but it's not like the best pizza I have ever had. I decided to try the lunch special #1 today, which is a personal cheese pizza, side salad and a soft drink for $9.50. The side salad was fine, it had a few slices of tomato, thinly sliced onion, and a few croutons over a bed of lettuce. I always get their house made Italian dressing on the side because that stuff is bomb. I also got a side of ranch because I like the combination of ranch and Italian on my salad, and then I use the extra ranch to dip my pizza into. The personal pizza was BIG, and much larger than what I imagined so that was a pleasant surprise. The flavor of the pizza is just meh to me. Granted I only got cheese this time, but I have tried a lot of their other pizza's before and nothing blows me away.  The service today was spotty. They only had 1 server and 1 cashier/hostess/phone person during the lunch rush, and it is very apparent that they need more help. The cashier/hostess/phone person is busy because she is trying to do 3 different jobs at one time. There are constantly people coming in to be seated, people who are leaving that need to pay, and people who are calling to place orders over the phone. It took about 5 minutes for me to be acknowledged by the hostess and taken to a table when I first arrived because she was busy doing other things. I sat down and was given a menu and some silverware. A gentleman came by and took my drink order and then I browsed the menu. In between that time, the hostess brought me out some fresh bread and butter. After a few minutes I knew what I wanted and just sat there awkwardly waiting for my server to appear. Finally after about 15 minutes, she came to my table. You could tell she was busy. I ordered and off she went. I saw her bounce from table to table all over the dining room. My food came out about 15 minutes later and it was fresh and hot. I had to hurry up and eat because my lunch hour was almost over. This meant I had to flag down my server to bring me my check which took her 5 minutes because she was busy bringing boxes and checks to other tables. Despite today's visit, I have decided I will be back to try their meatball sliders that are voted Best of Las Vegas. Hopefully the service will improve but I will post an update regardless.   Manager/Owner if you are reading this, you need more servers on at one time. I don't know if you were short handed today, 1/15/15,  but to me it is ridiculous to make 2 people run around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to please everyone. With more help, things will go smoother and I promise your customers will thank you for it, and your servers will get compensated better.  Yelp 2015 Review #13",

    "text": "I rushed in front of my computer screen to write this review after coming home from the godsend that is Metro Pizza. This is easily one of the best pies I've ever had in my life!   3 Reasons why Metro Pizza is as good as it gets:  1. The service was spectacular. Before we ordered, my dining companions had a math-heavy conversation about whether two small pizzas or one large pizza was going to be a better deal. We asked the manager the same question. I thought that I was going to get some BS answer but I was pleasantly surprised he had already done the math. He assured us that the large is indeed a better deal than two small pizzas. Of course they answered all of our \"stupid\" questions, topped off our waters, brought us refills of bread during our pizza wait, and the usual. At the end of the meal, the manager brought out complimentary cannoli's. What's there to complain about?  2. Metro Pizza is extremely accommodating. They were happy to half/half our pizza. We ended up ordering a large with the Patheon on one side and a Meat Lovers' on the other side. Metro Pizza also gave us nice sides of ranch without the usual 33 cent fee. They have a calendar of specials every day so you know you are going to get amazing food at a steal!  3. The Pie is amazing! Not too thick, not too thin.,.not burnt nor under-cooked. Goldilocks would have been pleased...these people put time and love into their pies. Everything tasted delicious but what impressed me the most was the crust! Pizza crusts are usually doughy and heavy but no! This one was light, crispy and airy. Amazing....simply amazing.",

He motioned to sit where ever. Ok, so we sat.  The waiter came by shortly after and he was nice. We ordered the Abbondanza, half Modesto and half Sunspot.  The pizzas were decent. We got happy hour prices so we can't really complain. It was a great deal. I am not sure if I would pay full price since nothing really stand out and menu price was a bit on the pricey side.",

The anti pasta salad was a surprise, there were plenty for the four of us and I did take a little left overs for lunch the next day. Be sure to try this salad, it's really good.",

Not some lame stuffed-crust gimmick or anything like that.  They do some of the better Chicago style stuffed pizza in Las Vegas.  They wouldn't quite be able to hang with the big boys in the Windy City, but their \"Southside\" is more than a solid choice in Vegas!  They also have some good lunch deals and wonderful calendar specials.",

They are almost $10 but worth it.They are made with garlic knots as the bun YUM! Ask about the daily specials. They have a printed calender telling you what special is each day that you can take home. They have it up on their website but I find it isn't updated regularly.  I recommend the stuffed pizzas they are so darn good! You can place your order for pick-up if you don't want or have time to eat inside.",

My go to is the Gotham which is like a supreme topping pizza.  The half price Monday thought Thursday's 2:30-4:30 is an incredible deal and the portions are great!  One of the best pizzas hands down and that's why I keep coming back for years.  Metro Pizza has great lunch specials as well including my favorite the salad and personal size pizza which is plenty of food!  The fresh bread they bring out is excellent but I don't recommend eating more than one slice in order to save room for pizza.  Love the 80s decor at the flamingo and Decatur location that seems like it has been there forever.  Staff is super friendly and they make you feel at home while dining.  Metro Pizza is hands down one of the best pizza spots in Vegas!",

I have never been to a pizzeria in my life that did not serve single slices, I had to order an entire small pizza with my order. Usually I grab a slice to start off then will grab a main dish. I decided okay, if they only offer the pizza by the pie it must be pretty decent, it was just okay. Wasn't bad wasn't great. Definetly not the best slice I've ever had and I'm sure not the worst. I also ordered meatball sliders, they also were just okay. Nothing about this place was either great or bad. I would have given 3 stars if I was able to get a single slice and save myself the $9 dollars I had to spend on a small pizza. Customer service was pretty good but you don't go to a pizzeria for customer service. May or may not come back, maybe if I were really craving pizza and nearby.",

First off the prices are very high and they don't even have a medium it's either big or tiny. Second we called to order over the phone 15 minutes before we arrived to make sure they had it ready when we arrived. We ordered a large half cheese half Gotham with no ground meat and extra sausage. We got there and we paid for the order and it took over 15 more minutes for them to cook our pizza. The customer service was extremely poor when we were there. They were not busy but took forever to get my order to me.  When we returned home we had the pizza and the crust was SO thin that the pizza broke apart. The crust underneath was burnt .   My girlfriend still raves this place but I still am not sure. Maybe if they get better faster service !",

I always joke about that you can't screw up making a good pizza but I've had people screw even that up.  Metro Pizza has never served me a bad pizza.   You can order the usual pepperoni, cheese, mushroom, sausage, etc. They are delicious and huge. But you can also order the stockyard. You say what exactly is a stockyard!? It's only a stuffed pizza. A stuffed pizza on steroids. Eat it with a knife and fork or just pick it up and stuff it into your mouth. You can eat a slice but can you eat another or maybe another after that? Don't forget the baseball sized garlic knots and desserts like cheese cake, tiramisu, and cannoli.   It's located in a shopping center on Flamingo and Decatur next to a Food4Less grocery store and Makino restaurant. Though it's spacious it does get busy. Also the interior is straight from the 80's in it's fluorescent colors kind of reminds me like The Max in Saved by the Bell but older notice the water stains. Customer service has been fast and friendly. I don't frequently go to this location but they all service excellent food.",

A house salad comes with the Pasta dinners but our server delivered a larger version of the salad for the two of us. The house bread was amazing; warm and fresh... that perfect crisp on the edge to the soft and tasteful inside. The sign of a good kitchen. The dinner fare did not disappoint. We'll be back!",

Metro Pizza never ever disappoints. I've enjoyed Metro for 15 years. Used to be a regular fanatic at the Ellis Island location. Awesome garlic knots!!  So anyway I hit up the Flamingo/Decatur location for takeout. On this trip I ordered the Modesto pizza. It was delicious. Simple but so good, and cooked perfectly. Awesome crust, mushrooms, crushed tomatoes, spicy sausage. And of course my wife had to have the chicken fingers. Her absolute favorite. She turned me on to these a while ago, and I have to agree with her, these are the best chicken fingers out there. You can order them mild, medium, or spicy. We opt for medium. Just enough tang and spice. The fingers are HUGE!!. lightly breaded, hot, juicy, flavorful. One bite and your hooked. Dip it in there delicious ranch dressing and you're in for a treat.   Metro is a local favorite and never disappoints. Really good pizza, chicken fingers, Italian favorites, great service, reasonable prices. You can't go wrong!!",

My favorite is the Bleaker Street which is sausage, garlic, and fresh basil. You can also get Chicago style, and  thick crust. My suggestion is stick to the regaular crust and you cant go wrong. Ask for some complimentary bread too, its mazing out of the oven. Metro is not cheap, but if you go there MOnday-Thirsday from 2-4, all pizzas are half off.  Also if you get the Old New York, you get fresh Mozzerella, not the shredded stuff. Classic cheese goodness!!.",

Now my husband and I have been coming to this metro for years and his parents before that. The food in fantastic and always so fresh. I don't live very far from here so I decided to order delivery one night. The food was on time and perfect. Later on that night I went to check my email and found out I was over charged (I get email alerts through my bank), I checked my bank and almost fainted. My bill was about $24, which I was charged and saw on my account, with an additional $236 (separately charged). They charged me twice. I called and spoke with the manager that was on for the night, he proceeded to tell me that they did not charge me twice and he doesn't know what happened. Well I know for sure the bank doesn't automatically charge you on their own. The staff must have charge me twice, the manager didn't believe that was the case. First of all, as a manager you should be reassuring your client, take some responsibility and learn how to do your job. You CANT tell me you don't know what happened . That is a joke!!! He called the owners and they said the charge was going to drop the same night and that it wasn't going to get charged. And then gave me a $25 credit for next time. Credit or no credit, it's not the point. Whoever ran my credit card, ran it twice and they couldn't take any responsibly for it, THEY JUST DONT KNOW!!!! Apparently, they just don't know what they are doing. So good food, but if you ever order delivery, be aware. And check your bank afterwards.",

Service on the other hand has been either spectacular or horrible. That being said, this is the most consistent of the Metro Pizza locations, and as Blair mentioned, its like going to the Max from Saved By the Bell. This has become our local Metro since moving across town, and we go once or twice a month. I've noticed it is never as busy as the E. Tropicana or Green Valley locations, its quieter due to its design, and the service is more consistent. The food is just as good as the other Metro's but the feel is like you are in a one of a kind pizza joint, not a mini chain pizza joint.  The pizza is pricey, but its worth it. Our regular order is a small South Side (Chicago style cheese), with a side salad (massive - more than enough for two people with great ranch dressing)...if their are more than two of us, we usually add the nuclear fries, which have a good level of spice to them.  Metro isn't the best pizza I've had, but it always hits the spot.",

    "text": "This is our second time to metro pizza and as always the pizza is absolutely outstanding.  However the service is bit spotty.  This boyfriend and I stopped in for an early dinner.  The busser seated us, took our drink order, served our drinks.  After about 7 min our server came over and took our order : garlic knots for an app and a Metro Pizza for us to share.  The garlic knots came out promptly and we're absolutely yummy.  Then the pizza was brought to our table.  It was ridiculously huge and not in a good way.  Neither of us are big eaters and literally I could've used this pizza as a couch cushion.  Upon looking at the menu again I found Metro offers two different sizes of its signature pizza but our server never asked us which size we would like.  We both ate less than a slice of pizza each before being full and having to ask for our pizza to be boxed up.  Don't get me wrong it was delicious pizza but just absurdly too large for anyone to imagine two normal sized people to be able to eat.  The busser boxed the pizza and brought us our check.  The only time we saw our server apart from her taking our original order was when she asked over her shoulder, on the way to another table, if we were doing okay.   To continue the monstrous pizza saga...upon arriving home we discovered this pizza box was too big to even fit in our full size side-by-side fridge.  In summary:  Food: 5 stars Service: 2 stars.",

We were given a free Soda to drink while we waitted for our Pizzas.   We ordered a Galic Bread starter that came as a small loaf baked with Garlic butter and covered in Mozzarella. Delicious.   Our Pizzas were cooked to perfection in a proper vintage Pizza Oven. Mine was a simple Pepperoni but they were very generous with the toppings and the base was really crisp and light.   My wife had ham mushroon & pineapple and was equally pleased.   before we left they gave us 2 big bags containing dried chillies and Parmesan cheese as optional condiments.

I was the greenhorn out of my group so the waitress was very helpful in recommending dishes that she thought I'd like. We ordered 2 pizzas. Your typical pepperoni and one Greek. Both were very tasty.
