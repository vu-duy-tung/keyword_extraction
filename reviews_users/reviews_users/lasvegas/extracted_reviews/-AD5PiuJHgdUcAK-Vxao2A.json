I have the SinCity Burger-seasoned meat, fried egg, special sauce and grilled onions with a basket of sweet potato fries!   I fell asleep with the burger in my hand because I was determined to finish the entire thing! I later woke up, burger still in hand, finished it cold and it was still tasty!  I'm a customer forever!

Doesn't really work for someone who usually wants a more healthy and affordable alternative for lunch.  The harvest chicken salad is still plentiful and tasty, but it just costs too much with the large size for a regular lunch. I know I'm kinda silly for not getting the burgers here, but a habit of burgers just won't do when I eat lunch outside on the daily.",

What's great about this burger joint is that they are licensed to serve alcohol. What's even better is that you can get a burger, fries and a beer all for under $10... you can't go wrong with that.  I also like the build your own burger menu, which makes it easy for peeps like me that are picky eaters. I love the fact that this place is neat, clean and 99% friendly with the exception of one time. I asked a question and was served a [bad] attitude by the female mngr on duty, but no biggie, everyone is allowed a crap day. I absolutely cheer this place on for all the tasty dealings their doing!

But since William was with me he INSISTED that I taste his mushroom Swiss burger. Now that is a thing of BEAUTY! The smashfries...not my favorite.. but I probably just don't like the rosemary on my fries.    So here it is the next day... I want a mushroom Swiss burger of my very own! It exceeded my expectations and beyond. I gave the haystack onions a shot... Fantastic! It also comes with a horseradish sauce that will clear your sinuses and please your palate.

    "text": "Just tried Smashburger for the first time, and was not disappointed.  I consider myself a bit of a burger aficionado, so I ordered the restaurant's signature burger and fries.  In the LV region, it's the Sin City burger and Smashfries.  Both were delicious.  However, the menu is much much larger, offering chicken burgers, hot dogs, and shakes, which I've yet to try, and expect to review in the future.  If there was a Shake Shack Burger in the West, Smashburger would be its close cousin.  Sin City Burger: -designed for carnivores (as it doesn't come with any lettuce or tomatoes) -beef patty is meaty, flattened, and has a wider circumference than the rest of the burger, so you take more time eating and enjoying it. -fried egg and caramelized onions complement each other, and the yolk adds to the savoriness. -egg bun provides a hint of sweetness -a bit oily, as it was evident that oil was dripping from my fingers.  does not diminish flavor and experience of the burger.  Smashfries: -crispy -rosemary and garlic seasoning is superb  Prices tend to be a little higher, as the burgers are fancier than fast food joints.  However, I used a BOGO coupon acquired from playing the burger smasher game on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsmashburgerburgersmasher.com%2F&s=85fb752bf42dbd4ed6b258bf06edc3ed029a32b2f14a543b0437fcbc22fe9f17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">smashburgerburgersmasher...</a>, which made it super affordable.  Would go again if I get another deal like this.",

I decided to just have water. I appreciated getting a regular sized plastic fountain drink glass as opposed to the tiny, cheap ones most places provide! My order was delivered to my table within about 7-10 minutes! The food was fresh and hot! The toppings on the burger were very fresh and stacked nicely! The fries were excellent, the olive oil and rosemary make for a great combination on the shoestring cut potatoes! Overall I was very satisfied and highly recommend this location! Both of the staff members I encountered were polite and friendly! The only thing I might do differently next time is order the salted caramel shake, a fellow at the table next to mine had one, it looked great and not only did he get the shake but they also bring the metal shake cup with extra in it to the table, he said it was awesome! I will be back!",

    "text": "Awhile ago when Smashburger first came to town on Lake Mead, I gave a scathing review of one of the worst burgers I thought I had ever eaten.  And then time went by and I had a Five Guys Burger and I realized - maybe I was too hasty about Smashburger, as that burger made McDonalds look like a delicious gourmet meal at Joel Robuchon.  I found it that disgusting.  So some Groupons came up and my husband and I jetted down here because he hadn't tried it before.  And I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it compared to the first time.  So I may go back to Lake Mead and try them again and see if I can update that review some time.  But I still have issues with some of the other items - The fried pickles, onion strings, and fries are not that great, still.  And while I love a wheat bun on my burger, the one that use at Smashburger just is too doughy and big for the burgers they cook.  The regular ones (yes I know, white flour bread is bad), are much better.  I don't really go to the UNLV area that often, but if I did I would definitely come back someday.",

I love 5 guys burger and fries and the famous In-N-Out, so I was already to write this place off.  Their sign looks like a GameStop, no sure if they are going for the geek crowd.  They have a few speciality burgers or you can design your own.  I went with the Sin City Burger, Fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and our smash sauce on an egg bun, but being from California I added avocado.  I also order a side of their smashfries, tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.  So good, the egg bun is soft and the flavor of the meat has some special seasonings.  Overall, a great burger, but I hope I can get the Sin City burger at the other locations too.  The Bad:  Why has it taken me so long to try this.  I thought they were only in Las Vegas but I just found out they are in San Diego also, when with they be in the OC?  The Ben:  The guy at the counter asked if this was my first time here.  I said \"why yes it is\", then he gave me the total.  I asked \"do I got something for my first time here\" he said \"nope, I just have to ask that\".  This place is now added to my must eat list when in Las Vegas.",

They have great burgers, fries, shakes... all that stuff. Plus, In N Out is a staple in the UNLV student's diet as it's so close to campus. And, yes, prices at In N Out are fair. I agree with all that. So why is Smashburger better? Read on.  First of all, this review is specific to this Smashburger. The other location I go to, the Lake Mead location, is really good, but is more hit-or-miss. This location seems to be consistently good, so I like it a little bit more.   Now, the food: the food here is good. My burger was really good, the tomatoes, lettuce and onions were good, and the sauce was good, too. It was a good burger! The bread was pretty good, too, so no complaints in that department. The fries were good, even though they were a little bit thinner than I like them. All in all, great food! Great burger, good fries.   As other reviews have noted, this place is more restaurant than fast food. The prices reflect that, too, so be prepared to pay more than you might want to. Still, this is definitely a place you want to check out!",

People who order this want to burn and it fails to do that.  The patty was big and it looked like a great burger but it was overdone to my liking.  I liked my wife's Sin City burger much better.  We actually ended up switching halfway through.  That burger was stacked with \"fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and our smash sauce on an egg bun.\" I ALWAYS want eggs on my burger.  The flavor was much better than the Spicy Baja and if I would order this if I were to do Smashburger again.    What's with the metal tray things they serve the burgers on?

There are awesome fry options including regular fries, sweet potato fries, and smash fries (rosemary, olive oil and garlic), which are a great alternative to the plain ones.  You can even get a side of the haystack onions.  Yes, please!  They serve milkshakes, which I can't wait to try.  I love that they give them to you plus the extra leftover in the milkshake cup.  I got asked for a water cup and they even cut their straws in half to fit the size of the smaller cup.   Prices are good. A little more expensive than in n Out and I think it just depends on what you're in the mood for - I can't say one is better than the other.    I wish there were more of these around the valley!  I will be back to try many more burger combos!",

Recently I had ordered it and instead of one nice large piece I was given two very small pieces.  I ate it said nothing and went about my day.  Now I'm back and I just mentioned to the person taking my order what happened last time so it might not happen again. Not only did I get a nice big piece but the fellow who took my order wold not charge me for it.  THAT is the kind of service you don't see everywhere today.  Much appreciated and above and beyond.  THANK YOU!!!",

My first impression was kinda ho hum as they were slow to get to the counter and take my order. And their fountain drinks were kinda flat and not mixed properly. But the food more than offset that. I loved my Spicy Baja burger and sweet potato smashfries. So much so that I am looking forward to coming back and having them again. They were really good!  When it comes to my list of hamburger places in Vegas that are fast and reasonably priced Smashburger in one visit catapulted itself to the top of my list. I like Smashburger! And I will be back!",

    "text": "Still my favorite burger joint. Got the buffalo grilled chicken on lettuce. Served up with plenty of sauce and bleu cheese. Nom! This burger would have earned them six stars, if I could have that many to give them.  They were out of sweet potatoes - bummer! - but made up for it with great customer service and super cheap Oly beer (flashback from my Seattle days). Being that they are located next door to a college, I honestly wasn't expecting good service (sorry, kids,) but was VERY pleasantly surprised. We were greeted by a friendly person as we walked through the door. She was busing tables clear across the room, but took the time to welcome us.   The man at the counter was efficient and patient (with my \"trade-this-for-that-and-make-sure-this-other-thing-doesn'-hit-my-food-and-can-I-get-a-salad-fork?\" quirkiness, I have been known to bring order takers to tears. He held up his end with a smile and some friendly banter.) When he came back out to break it to me that they had run out of sweet potato fries, he didn't deliver it in the typical \"sucks to be you\" fashion, but showed genuine remorse and offered to make it up to me. I got free cheese and onions on my replacement order of smash fries. Good job, kiddo.  Was reading some other reviews, where folks actually complained about the spicy fry sauce. Seriously? That's one of the BEST parts of this joint! Some people are so vanilla-bland brainwashed by the likes of McCrapper's that they wouldn't know good food if it bit them back. I mean, for crying out loud, it says spicy - what where you expecting? Strawberries? Geesh.",

Shakes - It doesn't get any better when you get a nice thick shake, and also the mixing canister it came in that is half full still of the amazing liquid gold!  Tasty, thick, and just right.  2.  Service - If you go right at lunch it will be crowded. We went during spring break and being next to the university and all, it was still busy with business types.  They ask you if you have been there before, and I said no, and they took my order. I have no idea why they ask you if you have been there, because nothing was explained.  However, complimenting the service is that they deliver to your table and they are friendly.  3.  Selection - Salad, Chicken, burgers, you have  great variety of burgers to choose from. IT is a bit overwhelming to figure it all out, however, everyone enjoyed their selection:  Ceasar Salad with chicken - Nice. Tasty, very little dressing which is perfect, and we added chicken on top. Thinly sliced and very succulent.    Classic Hamburger with Cheese - Just right size for the young ones. They did finish it, anything larger would have been an issue.  Classic Chicken - Nice. The chicken is also cut so thin, it is juicy and just right.  Beef Chili - Not too spicy. good tasting. Plenty of bits in it and it is not soupy.. Nice and thick...  Sweet Potato Smash Fries - These were very nice indeed. Such a subtle flavor.  Chocolate Shake and Butterfinger Shake - simply to die for.  GK says check it out.",

Its supposed to rival In-n-out, Five Guys, the Habit, etc.  This place definitely gives it a good try.  There are many options for the burger and all ingredients are fresh just like their competition.  The egg bun was actually good and everything was fresh, but it just was not that memorable.  My friend ordered the 1/2 pound and I ordered the 1/3 pound.  His patty was not thicker, just larger in diameter which I thought was a bit weird, but I get that they are trying to be original.  Their fries were definitely a big dissapointment, not sure if they were fresh potatoes, even Mcds fries are alot better.  So all in all, Smashburger is good if you are in the area, but I def wont crave it with so many other better options available.........",

Every time I've heard this place mentioned, it's compared to In n Out. While I do think that the food is better than In n Out, I still think that In n Out is a better value. All these new burger chains popping up are sort of in a different league than In n Out. In n Out is a real fast food restaurant (with a drive through, usually right off the freeway). All of these new places tend to reside in strip malls and are usually less convenient to get to. They have each other to compete with, and it's a tight race. In n Out is miles ahead of their True competitors in taste, quality, and service.",

    "text": "As I drove almost daily past this re-modeled (disaster of a) strip mall, I was excited to see the new eatery coming to our neighborhood. I've heard about them in other parts of our City. The food is good, but not great. I had the grilled chicken salad and fries. Salad greens not crisp and the chix, so-so. The fries are cut so small that you might need tweezers to eat them! (LOL) Now the price. This small meal was $9.71 without a drink and small tip. An average price of $12 for lunch, right next to many other restaurants with much lower prices will not work for this business. I'm sure the manager at In and Out (next door) is laughing, as his/her sales go up and up. Students have an on-campus meal plan for around $7 ( all you can eat). Why would they pay $12 to walk off campus? If they offer a combo for $7, they just might be able to pay the rent.",

Right off the bat the fact that all of the buns are \"egg buns\" was a strike.  Why not just serve regular buns?  Anyway, I ordered the BBQ bacon and cheese smashburger with a side of their smash fries, and hubby got the regular smashburger with their normal fries.  Unimpressive - the patties tasted frozen, and my fries were doused in olive oil. The only thing we liked were the normal fries, which we could have gotten elsewhere at half the price.  Sometimes, keeping it simple is the best way to go - I understand that burger places have to try to make themselves stand out, but when it's to the detriment of taste and common sense, it just doesn't fly.",

    "text": "UNLV is a virtual Mecca for cheap prices, good quality, and diversity in cuisine. Every time someone brought up burger joints, Smash was a destination worth mentioning. It was never the first on the list, but as I continue to cross out places I have tried, it was time to give them a taste.  When I entered, the cashier greeted me and asked if I had been there before. Usually when you reply no, the other person would explain, but he just asked for my order. That was not a big deal because I am usually set before I step anywhere near the register. The customer service was good overall, because when I did not order a drink, the cashier offered me a cup for water.  I had a job interview today, so I opted for the avocado club smash chicken sandwich because it did not have anything that would leave a lingering smell. If it was any other day, I probably would have gone for a burger with the works. The chicken breast was cut in two to cook faster, I liked this style because it allowed the meat to stay moist and juicy. Often the breast dries out and become overcooked if left whole. On top of that, they add four crisp strips of bacon, four slices of avocado, ranch, mayo, lettuce and tomato on a whole wheat bun. The sandwich is delicious, but pricey for the university area. At $7.99, you can go to In-N-Out and get a double double combo meal with a shake. At Smash, for the price of everything you would get next door, it would run you close to fifteen dollars. The food is good, but for that price I would probably go to Bachi Burger or Holsteins. I could pay a little more for a more unique meal.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Hulk Smash!!! - They really do smash the patty pretty flat. I ordered a 1/2 lb. burger and it was a good half inch larger than the bun. It also creates a slight burnt crisp to the edge of the patty that tasted good.        - Taste to Guilt Ratio - The flavor of the burger is amazing, but it's also incredibly greasy. I wouldn't recommend for anyone on a diet.        - Price - The price is comparable to other non fast food burger joints like Fatburger, Create, and Five Guys. Price being equal, I'd definitely shell out my Hamilton to clog my arteries at Smash Burger. **Price**        - $10 - $12 for a burger, fries, and a drink. **Ordered**        -  1/2 lb. Sin City Smash Burger - One of the best burgers I've had. It features a fried egg, bacon, haystack onions on an egg bun. The patty is smashed flat so it's a lot larger than the bun. The fried egg wasn't runny and it combined with the rest of the fixins to make a delicious heart attack.        -  Smash Fries - Rosemary, olive oil and garlic added to fries does seems strange at first, but the flavor of rosemary is unexpected and tasty.        -  Haystack Onions - Pretty much string thin onion rings with a chipotle mayo sauce. I didn't really like the sauce too much, but I don't really like chopotle mayo. **Recommendations**        - I'd definitely recommend this place if you like burgers. It's truly a step above your average fast food burger with the higher prices to prove it.",

We've only gotten orders to go, but I can't recall the service ever being bad. The only downfall is that their burgers can be a bit messy, so make sure you get extra napkins!",

Tonight I encountered Carey (Kari?), a woman at the register who was super helpful and kind. She said our order would be out soon, and she meant it! Our burgers were ready within a few minutes! Also, she readily accepted my coupon and even allowed my friend to use the same one.   I am super thankful to have had her assistance tonight. I will definitely coming back thanks to the food and excellent, speedy service.",

They have a pretty extensive menu with chicken burgers and their regular burgers. Also, you can build your own burger. They also have a number of different sides and shakes.  I like to get the Sin City burger, which has onions, egg, smash sauce, and bacon. Top it off with a side of smash fries and you're set.  They are a little bit on the greasy and pricey side, but this place is a pretty solid burger joint.",

I came in and immediately can tell it was somewhat busy. So after I order I walk away to get my drink and realize that I didn't get my number, which is not a big deal. So I get my number and I sit, about 15-20 min I get my food, that's a really long time compared to the times I've been here. I receive my food and they read me what I ordered but they gave me my food wrong so I tell her it was wrong and she takes it back. I then waited another 15 min for the food again and seemed fine. As I'm about to eat it I noticed my order was wrong again. I go up to them and let them know it was wrong and tried to blame it on me saying that's how I ordered it and they just made a whole new burger. I was not a fan of them trying to prove a customer wrong especially with some attitude. I then waited another 10 min and finally my order was correct. I waited 40 min for my food and I was so excited but sadly this visit wasn't the best.",

The Sin City Smash burger w/ spicy chipotle mayo and jalapenos <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smashburger-las-vegas-4?select=7gPzfADwbIT6xb3utlcKcw#tEvMVRY-uTBvyT29kvln5A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/smas...</a> whoa!!! Whoa!! Hands off!!!   I've always been hesitant to going to Smash Burger cause I always heard \"Oh expensive\" haha what!? Not even expensive.  Dumb non-yelpers haha jk.  I could have been eating smash burger for the 100th time not just 2nd. Oops I just saw a few yelpers say it's expensive, they're cool.  I think they're still kind of cheap for a good burger but yes a little expensive for a chain burger place especially if you throw in the add ons that aren't free.  When you go to Smash Burger do yourself a favor and just get the Sin City Smash Burger which already has a fried egg, bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onion and the smash sauce and play around with the free add ons.  I liked mine with the spicy mayo and jalapenos.  You don't always have to build your own burger that's when it gets pricey.  The fries are real good too. In and Out is good but I like Smash Burger (burgers and fries) more.   I heard they use to offer those punch cards for frequently eating there but nope not anymore but they do serve cheap beer. I'm not a fan of the service and that they don't have a drive thru.",

Sin city burger had American cheese, fried onion straws, bacon and topped with an egg.  Also really good.  Food doesn't take long at all, everyone is mostly nice, and a meal is usually under 12 dollars.  Burger, sides, and drink are all ordered separate.  Oh yea! Fried pickles are way too salty.",

    "text": "OK, I guess I can upgrade my rating.  I had a gift certificate for a free 1/3 pound burger burning a hole in my wallet, and I finally found myself near a Smashburger without having lunch elsewhere first. I was wary because it was one of my much maligned one-star locations, but I figured I'd order a different burger this time at least. Just as soon as one of the employees finally steps up to the register to take the order...  I had to wait with nobody in the ordering line ahead of me. Maybe two minutes, which wasn't terrible, but it reminded me of the bad service last time. The Mushroom Swiss burger ended up being the most captivating option. It had truffle oil, mayo, mushroom, swiss cheese, and the burger on whatever an egg bun is. I found it to be quite tasty and not too salty at all.  Congrats, UNLV location of Smashburger, you have regained a couple of stars. Maybe I will patronize your business establishment in the future. Having said that, I wouldn't really drive out here (or to the one on Eastern) when I have a fast food burger craving since I'll just fulfill it with In-N-Out or some sort of coupon instead. We shall see.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying that this is solely a review of the Sin City Burger. A coworker made a Smashburger run for lunch, so I put in an order for a 1/2 pound SCB. I haven't been to the restaurant, so I have no idea about service or environment.  Having said that, the SCB was crazy good. It's a little strange that the burger patty has almost twice the square inch-age as the bun. I guess that's the result of the \"smash\" in the company name. Despite its juiciness and relatively small bun, I was somehow able to eat it all without mess. Maybe I'm just biased towards any burger containing egg, but the SCB is oh-em-gee good.  I've heard good and mediocre things about Smashburger. I'm glad my experience swayed to the good side. I noticed they have malts on their menu. Ever since I learned that Sonic no longer does malts, I've been looking for them everywhere. I foresee Smashburger in my not-too-distant future.  BTW, why the heck does their logo look like Gamestop?",

I wasnt too excited to go here but my bf said that he'd driven by several times and hadnt gone b/c he wanted to save it for when we were together. awwwww.  so tonight we were orig. going to Catfish Alley but they moved ... and are no longer on Flamingo but off Silverado Ranch. well hell thats too far.   BURGER:  Baja Burger: see photo: my bf ordered the 1/2 lb beef baja burger. He said the jalapenos although were raw (uncooked or pickled) werent hot at all. He was kinda disappointed in that but he agreed it was a really good burger. He said he gave it 3.5 stars  BBQ bacon/cheese burger: I loved it. Its bbq was on the side. It had bacon *(which if it was on there I couldnt see it) those onion straw type onions. all on top of an egg bun. It was delicious.the show stopper was the patty. it was cooked to perfection, it tasted like one of those homemade patties that was so good. If it wasnt for the patty I would say next. but ti was THAT good.   SMASH FRIES: OLIVE OIL AND GARLIC. these were good but i love garlic so for me they could stand to put a lil more garlic on these.   SERVICE: EH.. Let's face it I'm not coming here for the service.. but for the food and a great burger. the guy that took our order didnt really atually take the order but more like just stood there waiting for us to order. Not once did he say what would you like? etc. So we just pretty much had to tell him what we wanted. He at least asked if that was all after we finished ordering. He was just plain weird.   Would I come back. Yes. do I hope that guy is there w/ the weird name.. no probably not. this is def. a placed to try.  10000x better than in-n-out!

Everything was a bit too salty for my taste but have to include that I didn't ask for no salt like I usually do at in and out.  Oreo Shake was pretty good as they added Oreos to make nice crunchy bits instead of it all being decimated.  The spinach and goat cheese burger was interesting and the avocado club wasn't that special. However the major negative was that the beef patty was precooked like McDonald's. It looked like it too. I remember  the burgers taking a long time to make but my order came out pretty quick. This only means cooked to order days must be over.  The meat came out dry and a bit unappetizing. Salt may have been used to hide that fact.   Experience 3 stars  Food 2 stars.",

    "text": "As Austin Powers would say, \"Smashing baby, yeah!\"  I have tried every one of their burgers and my favorite is the Spicy Baja!   With that said, for you noobs and/or connisseurs, your perfect starting burger and sidekick should be the All-American or Classic Burger and Smash Fries.  All their burgers are made from 100 percent angus beef and come in two sizes. Smash and Big Smash for a dollar more. They also have grilled and crispy chicken burgers for all you chicken fanatics.  The fries and the other sides alone can keep you coming back. Obviously, if you get a Big Smash, good luck in finishing your sides. What I usually do is one of 3 things. 1. Get a Smash size and side. 2. Just get the Big Smash cuz its much bigger so you dont really need a side. 3. For the few times that im really hungry and/or im with people, I get the the Big Smash and at least one side and sometimes two so we can share.  For a complete list of their menu and contact info, go to their website: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smashburger.com&s=1339174d2e792cb0fe2e9fb99e7242deb2a447c9c8ccb805133d26cbdc7d6a34\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">smashburger.com</a>  Service is decent and they try to get your order out in a timely manner. From all of the locations I have been in, their bathrooms are one person occupancy rooms. So sometimes you have to wait.   Random story. I was wanting to go to Gamestop to look for a game and subconsciously, I pulled up into the parking lot of a Smashburger. I guess from the color scheme it can easily confuse you if you are not paying attention. Nevertheless, I went in and got my Spicy Baja. Of course I still went to Gamestop later on.",

    "text": "I'm sad to have to write this review...I've been a Smashburger patron for years. This isn't my favorite location but it's close to work so I come here pretty often. Everyone has always been nice, place is clean, never any issues... Yesterday I got an email introducing their new Spicy Cowboy burger which looked darn good. The picture not only displayed the lovely burger but it detailed the ingredients as well. I called Smash, ordered this new burger to-go and it was ready for me right when I arrived. So far so good. Usually I drive straight back to work and eat my food... but this time I decided to sit outside on Smashburger's patio, and I'm glad I did. I ordered the large size, but mine seemed very anorexic. I took two bites and thought, this can't be the right burger. I recall several items listed on the advertisement that I'm just not tasting in my mouth. I pulled the email back up and noticed my burger was missing key ingredients, bacon and bbq sauce (how do you forget bacon on a bacon burger). I know it's a new burger, but if the picture in my email has the ingredients, I'm pretty sure they have it in the kitchen area. I went back in, went up to someone that looked like he had authority (he had a special red shirt on), explained the bacon was missing, he looked at me and said \"okaaaaay\" (kind of in a \"what do you want done\" type of tone). I was taken aback by that response. Then he said \"so do you just want bacon added on the burger?\"...seems the easy fix would be apologize for the mishap and make a new burger with all the ingredients...why are you asking me what should be done? I handed him my burger assuming they'd want to investigate to make sure I wasn't lying, and they proceeded to put bacon on my half eaten burger and gave it back to me. I asked \"did you put it back on my original burger?'...he said 'yes, did you want us to make you a new burger?\"...at this point my lunch break was running short and I didn't have time to wait for a new burger...I said \"no\" and left disappointed. I'm not so much upset over my burger being made incorrectly, mistakes happen. My annoyance is from how it was handled when I kindly brought it to their attention. Handing me back my original burger that was bit into was ugly. Smh.",

I tried my buddies chili cheese fries and I found it a bit odd that the fries were really thin. I got  the sin city burger and I added mushrooms. The grilled onions needed to cook a little longer. My egg was fully cooked and I prefer my yolk runny but then again it was really delicious. The burger was a tad oversalted. These are all small complaints. I added the fresh jalepenos on my burger from my buddies chili cheese fries and they gave it a nice heat. It really was a solid burger. I would definitely eat here again. I wasn't even that hungry and when I was done my burger looked like a high school virgin after prom night... non-existent.  The ice tea however, was  not fresh and flat out disgusting.",

My main beef with this Smash is when you check in on yelp they give you a 10% coupon towards your meal, they don't accept that anymore!!!! We got to the cashier and she said \"actually, we stopped doing that\". Really? Maybe you should make it so it doesn't pop up anymore.  Just frustrated. The food was good so I can't complain on that. Just big on delivering what they promise.  And... No soap in the bathrooms!!!! And they bring out the food seperately... Cuz I want to eat in front of my husband while he just watches me...  And the trash cans haven't been emptied in a while... Just displeased.",

It was cooked perfectly, full of flavor and that sucker was big. I only got the1/3 LB burger, the 1/2LB would have killed me. -I had a bite of my wife's Buffalo chicken sanwhich.

    "text": "I'm in love with a burger!  And it's called Smash Burger!   One of the guys in our party absolutely LOVED this place once he discovered it in Dallas.  In fact, he lives in LA and drives all the way to San Diego to get one; because that's the only place where they have it close by.  So naturally, when we got to Vegas and he found out there was not one, but TWO, here, he wanted to go.  SO I was more or less forced to go.  But I have never been more grateful.  It's funny because the font on the store looks like Gamestop, and our friend works for them; maybe that's how he discovered the place...  Also funny that there's an In N Out just down the street.  It's a $6 burger joint, so you're paying for a step up from your regular fast food joints; and you probably won't eat here every day, or at least couldn't afford to on most occasions, he he he.  The Sin City burger was the bizomb tho, applebacon, cheese, on an egg-bun.  SO good.  Doesn't seem like they use pre-formed patties either.  You can get the 1/3 or the 1/2 point size, I opted for the smaller for this first time.  Also had the fried pickles which tasted like fried zucchini, so that wasn't much of a big thing.  Wasn't too hungry so I didn't get to try the Mint Chocolate Milkshake, but I totally would've if I had room for it.  Definitely gonna hit this place up again!  Gotta try the other burgers!  I could see why my friend likes this place so much.  Good restaurant-style burgers with barely any wait and decent prices!    Service - It's a walk-up counter, so that doesn't really get factored in here.  Parking - Gonna have to drive or cab it here, cuz I'm sure you're not staying way off the strip, unless you live in the area =p",

    "text": "I've been to Smashburger a total of three times. Two of them happened to be at this particular location on Maryland Parkway right next to the UNLV campus. My experiences have been \"okay\" but more like... hey, I've had better burgers than this experiences. Therefore the 2-star rating must be awarded, especially after the visit I had last night after work.  All day I was looking forward to trying out the Baja Burger. I wanted something spicy, something meaty, something satisfying. I figured - this would be it! I was wrong. The burger was actually quite bland, unless I happened to be biting into a jalapeno. There was only a couple times I said, \"Hey, that's spicy\" and even less times I thought \"This burger is totally worth the price I paid for it\".   I suppose Smash-fans are lovers of all the toppings you can apply to burgers here. Perhaps the different sides you can pair with your burger as well. But to me - it's just not worth the price tag.  Baja Burger - 5.99 Smash Fries - 1.99 Coke - 1.89 Total - $11+  Note that Smashburger does NOT make combos. You must order these things separate. Almost 12 bucks for a burger combo? No thanks. I'll go to a sit down restaurant, pay that much and then leave a bit more for a tip. That would be better than this.  Overall the food was NOT BAD. The burger's bun was actually the most enjoyable thing I had. The Smash fries were not what I expected. Yes, I tasted the rosemary, but not so much the garlic. Plus my fries were teeny tiny fries! Like, I had gotten the bottom of the entire batch! I just cannot say I was satisfied and I can say I probably would have been more satisfied if I had just gone to Inn N Out next door.    3 strikes. Sorry Smashburger, you're outta my rotation.",

    "text": "Smashburger is one of those new upscale fastfood burger joints that have been popping up lately. Its in the same vein as Five Guys and the like. I don't really mind the food but to be honest, I can't leave the place and tell my self that it was worth the money I paid.   Don't get me  wrong... the food is good, waaay better than the slop you get at mcdonalds, but keep in a mind that an average combo is around $11+. To me that approaches the same cost as a sit-down restaurant which this is not. Smashburger is celebrated and improved fast food but its still the same stuff.   The restaurant itself is pretty minimal, big paint words like SMASH and BURGER all over the walls. The tables and seating area are better than would find at most burger places in town but this particular location is starting to look a little run down to me. Cracked seats, food under the table, - it needs maintenance.  You can't really complain about the burgers here though. They are big, taste good and are satisfying. They have enough options and add-ons to satisfy pretty much even the most pickiest of eaters. There are different buns, burger sizes, toppings, everything you could want. The ingredients are of great quality and the food is consistent.   The fries on the other hand is a totally different story, I've had every incarnation of fries they have on their menu. The smash fries, regular fries, sweet potato friends, pickle fries and to me, they all suck. The regular fries I swear to god are the same thing at mcdonalds, the sweet potato fries look and taste like they have been fried 3x. The smash fries are a good idea if I can get them not sitting in a puddle of oil every time they are brought out, and the pickle fries (yes they are there) are good but not something any body would get regularly.   Check the place out if you want a good burger, but its way over priced for what you get.",

    "text": "In my opinion, there's nothing above average about these thin, over-salted burger patties.   Smashburger gets one star for a nice and clean restaurant, and two stars for the smashfries (rosemary, garlic, olive oil - delicious).   I ordered the Spicy Baja burger. It comes with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, onion, tomato, and spicy chipotle mayo on a chipotle bun. When I placed my order, I asked for avocado instead of guacamole. It wasn't until I sat down that I realized they charged me $2 extra for that substitution. Usually, I wouldn't mind, and correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't guacamole made by mashing up avocado? And the piece of avocado that came on top of my burger was the size of two fingers and all I could do was roll my eyes.   Overall, the burger was nothing special. The patty was salty and a little dry and did not have much flavor. The burger was not juicy, it was greasy. There is a difference. Why eat here when you can walk 50 feet north and have In N Out?  My friend ordered the Sin City Burger and when he was about half way through his burger, he looked at me and said, \"this just might be the most delicious thing I have ever put in my mouth.\" O_o  Perhaps I did not order the right burger, or perhaps I'm just a little picky when it comes to burgers... but I am not a fan.",

Downside is that you either have to keep going up for beers- tons of separate transactions, or you have to order more than one for yourself- it gets warm.  I still like In N Out more. However these guys have good fries, sweet potato and regular, that drip delicious grease. The burgers are messy too, making dignified consumption difficult. What the hey, I'm already downing a Hamms, dignity long gone. The only thing I wished for was aioli to dip the fries in.  Spicy Baja: It's not end-of-world spicy. The \"smash\" size is more than enough. Retrospectively, In N Out patties have better flavor, but I did not even notice plowing through that monster.  I'd eat other burgers, but I'll have to sneak in furikake. I guess that's kind of why I only give 3 stars.

It wasn't very busy and the staff was already starting their closing chores. For a second we questioned if they were open or not. It was only 8:30 and lucky for us they are open till 10pm.   It took us a bit to decide since we weren't familiar with the menu. I choose the California Burger with no Ranch and Joel ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger with Smash Fries and a drink. They have a large selection of fountain drinks, but I didn't see any tea. Our food was out to us at a pretty quick rate. My California Burger had avocado, bacon, mayo and tomato on a whole grain bun. It was kinda dry, but I think it was because I asked for no Ranch. Joel's was amazing! It was full of mushrooms, onions, mayo and was dripping with Swiss cheese!! We actually ended up switching burgers. I also really enjoyed the Smash Fries. They were shoestring fries that were covered in olive oil, rosemary and garlic. Great flavor combination.   I've seriously been dreaming of that Mushroom Swiss Burger since we went. I haven't had a great burger like that in a while. I think the California Burger would have been better if I'd asked for more mayo instead of the ranch. Great quality burgers and fries that aren't too over priced.",

    "text": "This was my first Smashburger ever, apparently they're in the \"higher prices but higher quality\" burger chain space also occupied by Five Guys, Fatburger, etc.   Just for an idea, burger/fries/drink here is probably going to run you $10-12. I think the lowest meal price you can get away with would be around $8-9 for the smallest size of Smashburger, regular fries and a soda.   You start by picking your burger size. I had one of their \"$12 for $7 coupons\" so I sprung for the largest bacon cheeseburger combo'd up w/ Smashfries and drink, which was just over $12 before coupon. For the most Bigly of the burger sizes, I was expecting a meaty patty akin to a small double cheeseburger. What I got was more like what I expected the \"regular\" size to be ... in fact the patty didn't even fill the regular-size bun.  The beef was also questionable, like when you buy high-fat cheap Walmart burger meat, mush it into a patty at home to fry in a pan and don't drain it off, and it comes out all fat-drippy. Regarding beef quality, their website says they use \"100% Angus\" but that's basically a meaningless marketing term (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chowhound.com%2Fpost%2Fangus-beef-marketing-term-642330&s=661cc82fc86ceb0108aef0fb71870533bc7d5aaed5a98885f13a0be6559f4d84\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">chowhound.com/post/angus...</a>). I expect $12 a meal for a good grass-fed burger, not so much Walmart ground beef.   I know this is an individualized thing, but they do shoestring fries here, which are by far my least favorite of the french fry styles. The \"Smashfries\" upgrade is only 20 cents extra but I don't feel like it really improves the experience -- they're just tossed in olive oil and rosemary, which makes them taste more like a flavored potato chip.   To conclude on a positive, the restroom is one-at-a-time and well kept. Also better seating environment than most fast food with a lot of high-backed booths.  tl;dr for an asking price of $12 I feel like the burger size and quality of the beef and the fries is just not quite there. It's a little better than the bottom-dollar fast food chains, but not enough to justify double or more the price. Opening up right next to In-N-Out is ... well, \"bold\" if you want to be nice, \"suicidal\" if you want to be brutally honest. I'm no big fan of In-N-Out but it's definitely a vastly superior value proposition with the quality not standing up here.",

I ordered and waited maybe 3 minutes and my food was ready??? As I was leaving I noticed the cook who just placed my order in the window had an unlit cigarette tucked into his ear which raised my curiosity about cleanliness. After I got to my hotel room which was only a couple blocks away at the Bluegreen Resort, the bag was so totally soaked with oil which has now made a mess on the counter. When removing the contents from the bag, all the napkins that had been placed into the bag were soaked with oil as well. The burger was soaked, the fries were soaked and ice cold as well as the damn ketchup packs leading me to believe that the fries had been sitting out for awhile already (remember, my order only took 3 minutes to prepare???). It was so disgusting I had to throw it out! Stay away from this place, the food will make you sick just looking at it!",

My colleague and lunchmate suggested it, and off we went.  The burger itself was great.  I ordered a small make-my-own burger on classic egg bun, topped with grilled onions, fresh jalepenos, fried egg, avocado, and goat cheese.  For some reason, this combo truly worked.  It was darn tasty.  The egg was not runny at all, but it still added a special flavor.  It was initially forgotten when my burger arrived at the table, but was quickly brought back.  I also ordered the sweet potato smashfries.  The concept of the added spices is great on fries, but the sweet potato fries looked double fried, completely different than the regular fries my friend had.  Also, each bite tasted like soaked in oil - and it was oozy.  I did not eat much of the fries.  It is quite expensive (especially with my add ons) but the small burger is the right size and as a clean slate is under $4.  I would return for my specific combination of deliciousness.",

Since my girl and I were just traveling through Las Vegas, we didn't want to indulge into all that \"Sin City\" cravings.  That definitely includes food, with all those tempting Lobster and Steak buffets.    Instead, we were headed to In and Out and saw Smashburger across the street.   THANK YOU JESUS FOR BEING BEHIND OUR STEERING WHEEL, and steering us straight on over to Smashburger instead.  Now, we will forever be into some In and Out burgers - but not only did Smashburgers show out with their Spicy Fries and BBQ Bacon Cheddar Big Smash Burger, but Smashburgers also showed out with their incredible customer service.    The  guy behind the register was awesome with communicating the local favs and when the store manager found out we were travelers, traveling through, he offered some Smashburger dollars or us to try other Smashburgers along our roadtrip route.    We will definitely be adding Smashburgers to our favorite list of burger spots.",

Not a bad idea at all by the folk over at corporate Smashburger trying to test the waters by putting a location right across the street from about 30,000 hungry collegiate students, some of whom are undoubtedly sick of the campus food.  After putting our order in I was sad to hear that they no longer accept the 10% off with the Yelp app check-in anymore. However, in lieu of the discount the nice lady behind the register comped one of our burgers instead!  Much like the other Smashburger locations, the food is tried, tested, and always a home run. It tastes great, is brought to your table quickly, and an employee is always there for a follow-up to ask how the food was.",

As well as a make your own and some smash fries tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic. I had a make your own veggie burger on a multigrain bun, veggie fries which are flash-fried carrot sticks and green beans AND a harvest salad with fresh greens, balsamic tomatoes, raisins, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and blue cheese topped with balsamic vinaigrette, no blue cheese, add guac. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM! Way too much food, the salads at $5.99 are HUGE! SO fresh, def enough, the burger great, black bean, very tasty. Veggie fries, also tasty. My son got a kids meal, also generous in size, we paid just under $40 for a ton of food. The restaurant is super clean, everyone here is really on top of their game and offer fantastic service. You get fresh and healthy food for a fast food price, that just can't be beat! The manager checked on us often, he was great, I like the open kitchen, I need a Smashburger closer to home, they really are THAT good!",

And even though I'm NOT a fan of rosemary, I must admit these people struck a great balance between potato, garlic, salt and rosemary. I would order them again.  The burger was good (even though it was well done) and we opted for the Udis gluten free bun and bacon OTS (on the side) next time I'd get the classic with cheese...tomato and lettuce would have been a big help since we all know gluten free bread is always a bit dry.  The spinach and goat cheese salad w/ grilled chicken was awesome!!! The cheese was fantastic &flavorful. Here's what came in the salad: fresh spinach, diced balsamic tomatoes, raisins, dried cranberries, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, red onion and cucumber. We asked for dressing on the side, but the balsamic from the tomatoes was plenty! The chicken was perfectly cooked through and still moist! A+.  Enjoy and have a great day!",

What the heck?! Where did they go? In my belly, yep.  But other than the sweet potato fries I don't know how much I would rant and rave about this place.   I ordered a sin city burger and it was tasty. The patty itself was well flavored. The bun was soft and buttery. My egg was just how I not like, well done and crispy. But overall it was a solid burger. Bacon was one strip cut in half to try to cover most of the burger, didn't work out so well.  The regular smash fries suck though. Bland, limp and major suck-age. The haystack onions were pretty tasty, just kinda greasy.   I walked away from this place really enjoying their burger but I don't know if it is the best burger ever.   I was crippled by poor customer service, starting from the girl who didn't know how to ring us up and ended up using the wrong groupon.  That itself was an experience. I am not sure that they felt so bad about it. They made me feel like I was crippling them with my problem. Manager finally came and said sorry to me as we were about to leave our table while cracking her knuckles. In my opinion, just not so professional. Maybe it's a nervous tick for her but it can easily be misconsTrued and taken another way.  It's a fancy dressed up burger with a fast food feel to it. Definitely worth trying at least once. I would return if I was with others and they wanted to go, just don't know I would say I had to go to this place to have their burgers. The sweet potato fries, yes.",

Be careful, when we got there, 3 cop cars had to pull over a car across the street from this place! Friday night commotion! haha.  - Fast service. We got our burgers in less than 10 min.

Better than Chick Fil-A. Amazing!  - French fries were cut thin. Had better fries, but still good.  - Free shake on your bday.

Only having 30 days to use the Groupon, we dropped in when we were sort of in their neck of the woods since this is a bit out of the way for me.  Located near the University, next door to In and Out and across the street from Cafe Rio, it is surrounded by all of my favorites. The restaurant was clean and there were a few but not many people eating. We had no problem using the Groupon and knew right what we wanted: The Vegas Burger, The Truffle Mushroom Swiss Burger, Fried Pickles, a Blue Moon and a Fat Tire.  The beer was brought to our table and we were offered frosty mugs - why yes of course! I love that! The food came out shortly after. It tasted much like I remembered with 2 distinct differences. 1) the Vegas Burger had PILES of sauteed onions! UGH... I like a little bit of onion, but this had seriously about 1/4 cup of them piled on and melted into the cheese... way too much! 2) both burgers were extremely greasy! That was one thing we noted during the CMYE, the burgers were juicy but not greasy. In fact, the owner had touted that they taught the cooks to sear in the juices so it wouldn't be greasy. Also, they toast the bun to keep the bun from getting soggy... well, that was not our experience. I enjoyed the fried pickles however.  The food was good, don't get me wrong, I'll return to Smashburger again... it just wasn't the experience we'd had at the other location, it truly was a let down.",

I paid $24 for 1/2 Classic burger which was supposed to be the Sin City burger, sweet potato fries, 2 milk shakes (chocolate and caramel which are made of Haagen Daz... YUMM!) and 1/2 Baja burger. And no, I didn't it all by myself. I also tried little bites of the Sin City, Mushroom burger and the veggie frites. Not too shabby.  The service was great. This place is perfect if you're on the go because cooks are fast.  This place can be compared to Steak and Shake at SouthPoint BUT not comparable to Bachi burgers in my opinion.  Would I come back? Probably not as much since it's located at one of the busiest streets of Vegas.",

Bachi Burger blows them away at the price point, or go next door to In-n-Out and spend half the money for a better product.  The burgers are maybe a step above Burger King -- dry, grainy beef that gets its only juice from the grease of the grill. No real taste to the meat, though the saving grace was the preparation I ordered with pepper jack, jalapenos and guacamole.  The fries are OK, nothing special. We had the sweet potato fries, which were nicely seasoned but disgustingly greasy. We also ordered the \"veggie frites\", and what a mistake that was. There was no batter, just some vegetables dropped in oil and fried. They tasted exactly like if they hadn't been fried, yet with all the grossness of hot dripping oil. Avoid the veggies and their $4 price tag at all costs.",

At least half of the time, the order is wrong. Today they fogot an order of fries, and the Buffalo chicken sandwiches had no hot sauce on them. Another time three out of the four lunches were incorrect. But, when they are on, they are on- and the food is very good. Salds are huge, and the chicken sandwiches are very large as well. It is always jam packed, and it never seems like they have enough help. I keep going back only because we are addicted to the Buffalo chicken sandwich- crispy!",

I ordered the Mushroom Swiss Smashburger and my husband got the All-American Smashburger. We also tried their Smashfries with their seasoning of rosemary, olive oil, and garlic. The burger was delish! I really liked the texture of the meat and the amount you get. Plus my burger was loaded with mushrooms as the cooks seemed to be super generous with the portion. It was really tasty. The fries were also great and the seasonings were good too. The prices to me are pretty reasonable considering we got the 1/3 lbs. each with a grandtotal of about $14 bucks. I would definitely eat here again. It's funny how their sign resembles the GameStop sign. Makes me want to eat a burger and play xbox.",

I also got an order of the sweet potato fries which were not bad, but not at all GOOD. The seasoning seemed....odd. I can't describe it any better unfortunately.

The location is pretty bold, I mean they actually setup right next door to In and Out. They decor upon entering is kinda trendy, really modern and easy going. My wife and I were greeted with a smile and helped out right away. She ordered the basic Smash Burger with Avocado and some sweet potato fries. The fries were cooked with garlic salt and rosemary of some sort. That made for an interesting blend of flavors in my mouth. I ordered the Sin City and Chili Fries. The fries alone are bearable but nothing worth stopping traffic over. The chili was really simple but the onions made it a solid dish. The real jalapenos is what saved this dish. Without them it would have been just another layer of chili sitting on top of some ok fries. The Burger was awesome at first, then the last half just tasted like soggy egg break covered in egg, beef and bacon. They did however include some really cool ketchup packets with the meal.  I hate to say this, but it really wasn't worth the hype. In fact I don't think ill be going back anytime soon. If i had to chose between them and the competition next door, it would be double double city all day long. I wont waste time comparing them to anyone else, but i will say that there are much better burger joints in Las Vegas then this,",

Mine weren't pooling in oil, but I see how this could easily be an issue if someone gets a tad overzealous in the kitchen. 2) The bun.  Doesn't look like anything special, but tasted better than the competitions to me. 3) They have milkshakes.  Made with haagen-dazs ice cream.

I missed my lunch break so I'm more than just hungry at 4pm so I'm in a mood for something substantial.  It's a burger joint but it took me a couple minutes to figure out the menu and cashier was not really helpful in explaining what's what so I decide to settle on mushroom swiss burger (how bad can it be, right?) and sweet potato fries (can't mess it up either, right?).  So after 5 minuted I get my tray and... Burger: meat is good, cheese is just 1 slice barely covering half of the patty and mushrooms are... pretty much non-existent. It came with no lettuce and tomato so I had to ask for them from kitchen (and cashier never even mentioned that I need to ask for it all!)   Sweet potato fries: epic fail... pool of oil on a bottom of the basket! That's the first time ever I had to ask for refund in a fast-food! But heck no, I'm not paying for the oil change... even McD can do fries better.  Bottom line: FAIL. Bill (before refund for fries) was more than $8 (and no drink!) So.... stick with the establishment next door for burgers - for $8 I'll get burger, fries and milk shake. I wonder how long will this place last here...",

The Chocolate Milkshake at In-N-Out is far more superior....Anyhow, for me the burgers win hands down and I just can't get over those veggie fries-Yum!!!  I'm glad Smashburgers are popping up all over the place. I just wish one would open up in my area-Silverado Ranch or maybe even Henderson!!!!",

This lunch hour wait is on par with In N Out next door.   I had the BBQ Bacon Cheese Burger. It was pretty good but the application of BBQ Sauce was thin at best. For an extra topping I ordered jalapenos and they came out raw, I was expecting the pickled variety. I probably wouldn't have those again. I also ordered pickles as a topping and these were quite good, thick slices similar to a Clausen, not your typical hamburger pickle chips.   For sides we had the regular fries and fried pickles. The fries weren't bad, sort of reminded me of McDonald's, although I would have liked a few more. The fried pickles were not too good, pickles were sort of mushy (star deduction) For now I will stick to ordering my fried pickles at Memphis BBQ or Lucile's.   Second star deduction is the price. Don't get me wrong, the burger was good, but so is In N Out and for less than the price of one burger at Smash, I can get a whole meal at In N Out. I'll be back, but not often.",

Applewood smoked bacon, haystack onions, grilled onions and a fried egg. All served with what they call their smash sauce. Couldn't really get a distinct flavor with their smash sauce, had so many other things going for it in that one burger alone. But the burger was great. Came out fresh of course and juicy, can't go wrong. Had their Smash Fries as well, flavors weren't overpowering.great flavor overall. Wanting to go back to try the other stuff they got.",

    "text": "Iv'e been meaning to leave a review on this crap of burger place, but seriously, how important is \"Assburger\". This year, since this is my last year in Vegas, I told myself i wanna try best burger spot out here. And so far, its not being going so well. Me and my lovely lady decided to try SmashAss on a Saturday, since we heard so many great things about them(Im not being sarcastic, for once). I walked in solo since I was just getting a take out order. The line was pretty steep and it took a good 10 mins before I could place my order. I decided to have the 1/2lb Sin City Burger(lettuce,pickles,grilled onions,bacon,swiss cheese and a fried egg) w/Smash Fries and my girl got the build your own burger(lettuce,tomatoes,pickles,mayo,mustard,swiss and avacado)w/fried pickles and a couple sides of ranch. Now just from the looks of it, you would think these burgers were great right??...WRONG!!! To spare you my complaining, the only thing I liked on my burger was the fried egg. The bacon was burnt and the burger really just tasted like onions and overcooked meat. Well, thats pretty much what I was eating(Duhh).The \"egg bun\" they have is pretty basic and so are there fries. My girl said her burger tasted like Sh*t(fyi:It didnt really taste like sh*t, I had a bite of it when she was done, pretty bad, but no sh*t taste :) Also, im not an expert on avacado, but is it suppose to be brown?? Well the stuff on her burger was. Lastly, the reason for the 1 star is the lack of quality in simple sh*t that should be good, such as ranch. This had to be the worst ranch ever. It tasted sweet like Kraft ranch you by from Wal-Mart. Cool people, Horrible Food.  PS:SOGGY ASS FRIED PICKLES, eat them if you love cholesterol!!!",

I'm not entirely sure how much less factory these guys are.  Their burger is nothing to Yelp about.  Haha.  That will replace \"write home about\" pretty soon.  I liked their aoili sauce.  The only reason they get four stars is that they allow you drink beer at the store and it's only $3 for domestics which is approximately 150% cheaper than a casino.  They ran out of regular fries.  The line was long and it took a while, but seriously, if you want a better burger, you really do have to wait for it.  They give you a number and bring your food to you.  This is a great concept because you get to sit down and drink a beer and FB while you wait.  I still think Five Guys has the best chain burgers around followed by Fuddruckers and Fatburger.  Fukuburger, the Vegas burger truck has mediocre burger patties with incredible sauce.  One of these days, I'll order a Five Guys, wipe everything off it, and put the Smashburger aoili on it or the Fukuburger sauce on it.",

    "text": "It's really quaint place and it is nice to see something in that spot in the strip mall.  I was really excited to try this place after being tired of In/Out and wanting something gourmet but also delicious.  It's a little bit more expensive than going to a normal fast food place, but it is worth it in terms of taste.  I got the Sin City burger which has all the things I love, breakfast in a burger + onion straws.  I love eggs and bacon on burgers, and the egg was cooked decent.  A little overcooked for my liking (I prefer over easy), but it's not exactly a restaurant I would assume cooked eggs to the specific likings of costumers.  Downside, although the burger was tasty it was oily.  Oilier than most burgers I've had.  It didn't take away from the taste, but I know when I'm eating it that I'm probably digesting more calories than a normal burger, which makes you feel more guilty than normal.  Aside from that I also had sweet potato fries which were really good until I got to the bottom and the last fries were too oily for consumption. This place also gives me a small vibe of dirtiness.  It's not filthy, but I felt filthy in there for whatever reason.  All in all, I'll definitely go here again, but it won't be something that I'll definitely need on a regular basis to fill my burger needs.",

He said that it was not very flavorful, and not juicy. He was disappointed.  On the other hand, I came in wanting something not quite as fattening as a burger. I chose the grilled chicken sandwich which has lettuce, tomato, pickles, red onion and mayo. I asked to switch the mayo for chipotle mayo. I was very pleased with my change, as it turned out great. The chicken patty was nice and thin, and came out hot hot!  I would definitely get this sandwich again, as it had a lof of flavor, especially with the chipotle mayo. Tasty!",

    "text": "On my quest to find a good burger for lunch, I decided to eat at SmashBurger because I've always seen it whenever I'm near campus, but all my time I've lived in Vegas (going on my third year now), I really didn't see the need to come in here with In-N-Out being their neighbor. Anyway, I decided to give it a chance and finally ate here.   Upon entering, I was actually a little surprised at how nice the interior looked. It didn't look like it was going to be much from the outside, but the layout of the place is nice and spacious. It has a modern, well-maintained look.  I ordered the mushroom swiss burger with a side of their smash fries.  The mushroom swiss burger was pretty tasty. I decided to go all out and asked if they could incorporate a fried egg in my burger, which they gladly obliged to do! I wish the egg would be a little runny so the yolk would break and add even more flavor to the burger, but this fried egg sufficed (and I guess it's better not being messy lol). The burger buns were soft, the mushroom flavor was there, and the burger patty was juicy -- that's a perfect burger in my book!  Their smash fries were pretty good, too. They were thin shoestring fries that are tossed in olive oil, rosemary, and garlic. They were cooked to perfection and had a crunch to them (but they weren't burnt or brown-looking). I usually don't like soft fries because they get soggy easily, so this definitely was a good choice for me!  I was delighted that this is near campus because it's super convenient for those in-between-class meals. It's a place to go to if you want a more customizable burger than the burgers at In-N-Out next door. In my opinion, it was worth the visit here and you can't go wrong with a good burger for a decent price!",

In my opinion, it wasn't that big of a difference. The flavor of the burger itself was just ok. I like that the burger was cooked on a skillet top, to seal in flavor, but it was negated by being slightly over cooked. Oh yeah, almost forgot, as they did, I didn't receive the style of burger I had ordered, but wasn't on the mood to say anything, so I ate what I was given.   I can't say I won't be back, but I won't make Smashbuger my first choice or referral either.",

I usually get a CYO (I love that you can customize!) burger with a gluten free bun and veggie frites. I love having the option of vegetable fries, and they're yummy to boot. Definitely recommend!",

The beef hamburger was smashed just a bit too oversized for the egg bun and towards the finish, the outside beef broke off. It was the first time I had a smash burger. The cheese was melted, the bun was toasted and the onions were grilled. I thought the beef was a bit too greasy, but the caramelization and tad bit of charing on the burger with just the right amount of seasoning added to its deliciousness. Not quite my type of burger, but worth a try. I love grilled onions, egg hamburger buns and a nicely caramelized chunk of beef.",

    "text": "I got done with class one day and I was starving, and to no one's surprise the first thing that came to mind is Smashburger.  Very close to UNLV, so it was within the proximity of accessing food before reaching maximum hunger.  The thought of biting into one of the great burgers they have was undeniable.  I ate the Sin City Smashburger and it was good.  I had the 1/3 pounder with fries and it filled me up very well, I can't imagine how filling it would be with the 1/2 pounder.  Now let me note that Smashburger may not appeal to anyone.  You have to be at the right mood and hunger to really enjoy this smashing, oil-drizzling, fatty patty monstrosity to its fullest potential.  To the average eater or person with medium hunger level, it can get nauseating very quickly.  It's greasy goodness can leave you feeling rounder by each bite, the fat patty becoming harder to swallow by every minute, and a guilt trip that can last for days. My only justification for eating was because I'm going to be in the hot sun and swimming for the next couple of hours.  And to be honest, I don't even know if that's enough to burn off all the calories I ate.  With each passing moment I noticed that the burger got saltier and saltier.  Maybe my hunger was dissipating and finally my body started listening to my taste buds.  I could not finish the fries without drowning it in ketchup to lessen the saltiness.  Still, it's an experience.  It's hard to find an unique burger joint with so much greasy and eggy goodness (many of their burgers have eggs in it).  I'd definitely bring my friends over for a big burger eat-out.  I can't imagine myself eating here everyday unless I want to look like a pudgy round asian guy rolling around sponsored by Pizza Hut.  But it's a great place to visit once in a while, probably on a special occasion.  A little greasy, oily and salty, but would it be crazy for me to say that's part of the charm? Because it definitely is.",

So I didn't think much of it. Well when we left those same tables and the bathrooms were all dirty, and it was starting to get busy, so Im pretty sure the place staid dirty until they closed.  When it comes to the food, since I am Vegetarian, I got the Black Bean Burger, which was ok, but was poorly made and kept falling apart on me, which is annoying. Now what keeps me from giving the place a 2 or 1 is two different things.  The 1st is Sweet potato fries, they were DELICIOUS, and the 2nd was the deep fried PICKLES. I was scared when I saw them on the menu, but ordered them out of pure fat curiosity. This time curiosity didn't kill the cat, instead it made its ass jiggle for a week. My FAT HEART almost exploded when I tried them  In conclusion, I will come back, but only for the SWEET POTATO FRIES and the DEEP FRIED PICKLES, and I will get them to go, and pick up aBoca burger from Fat Burger instead.",

Their burgers are so delicious and flavorful and there are so many yummy toppings to choose from so you can make your ideal, personalized hamburger (avocado, bacon, cheddar, grilled onions on a pretzel bun... YUM!).  I don't get people who say it's expensive compared to a place like In & Out- of COURSE it's more expensive than In & Out. In & Out is a straight-up fast food hamburger. Smashburger is on the border between a fast food and a restaurant burger; the two cannot be fairly compared!

I got the fries in the olive oil and they did taste good, but were soggy and the bottom ones were left in an oil \"soup.\" The burger itself was unremarkable. The meat did seem to have a specific taste to it, but any taste it had was overshadowed by the large bun. It's almost as if the burger had no taste at all. In the end, my throat was coated by something in either the fries or the burger that I was attempting to spit out all day, and similar to another review I read, I had a stomachache for the rest of the night.  On the plus side, the service was great and the people were really nice.  Maybe the stomach issue could be attibuted to the fact that I'm not for the most part used to grossly unhealthy food. If I ate McDonald's after years of not touching it, I would have a similar experience. Given the option, I would instead go \"Fat\", \"Five\", or just go in and out.  I can't imagine that I would return here.",

A bit too well done for my liking. Carmelized bacon was really good.  BBQ sauce was just regular KC Masterpiece or something.  It was a pretty good burger, I will admit.

I enjoy the Smash Burger most: Burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese, bacon, and a fried egg.  I guess it's probably a little overboard, but it's a great burger to have every now and then.  The fries are good, but I recommend the sweet potato fries and the smash fries (regular fries with evoo and rosemary).  If you're near this location or one of the other Smash Burgers, stop by.

The restaurant wasn't crowded but we stil sat down at a dirty table. When my husband asked for it to be cleaned it was done but not well. My husband actually asked for a towel so he could clean it himself, and of course that didn't sit well with the staff. My daughter's order of Rosemary and olive oil tossed fries had a pool of oil at the bottom AND when she was grossed out and went to the bathroom feeling nauseous a grown man walked in on her!!!! Not ok. My sandwich itself was very fresh but my lettuce leaf was so big I had to break and fold it over again. My meat flavor was just ok,nothing to rave about but it was WAY too salty. I'm sure that was a mistake. They didn't serve bad food, but I can cross this place of my to do list.  Been here done this... I won't be back. But the lady who took our order was very nice. Until we needed the table wiped.",

    "text": "Ok ... I am a burger fanatic ... I've had great and not so great burgers on a few continents and several countries. This one fits into the category of a marginally upscale fast food burger, not too bad and not so outstanding. The one thing they do really well is their bun. The \"smashed\" burger is \"cooked to government standards\" and not a bit of pink remains. I like more medium rare or even medium and the well done characteristics are just not as tasty to me. Had the sweet potato fries with it and they were served in a waxed paper cone that kept all the fat and oil on the fries. The cashier for our visit was a young girl who spoke way to fast and we missed a couple of minor points that would have enhanced our visit. The sad truth is that this is one place \"I don't need to go again\" instead of a \"give it another shot\" ... too bad for them.",

Then it occurred to me: I wasn't having a hard time describing my experience, nor was I at a loss for words.  It's that Smashburger simply didn't make any memorable impression on me.  I ordered a BBQ bacon cheeseburger and sweet potato fries.  My friend ordered a regular cheeseburger.  Both burgers were cooked well (a little too well for me, but hey, this isn't Burger Bar) and were nice and juicy.  The fries were thin and crisp, with a hint of sugar.    Everything was fine, nothing \"WOW,\" nor terrible.  Very middle of the road, hence my three stars.",

I ordered the Classic SmashBurger 1/3 lb and he ordered a bacon cheeseburger with no bbq sauce. I think that order confused the cashier because he asked my man to repeat his order twice....no biggie.   We sit down and they promptly bring out my chocolate malt which was yummy to the tummy and then my burger follows shortly behind. My portion of the meal was perfect. My man's food on the other hand was a bit off. The cashier didn't get the order right and the poor runner had to bring it back twice (first it came out plain, then came again with just bacon, then it came back the correct way with bacon and cheese). When it came back for the third time...IT WAS DELICIOUS! They were very kind and apologetic about the whole thing. Like I said before....they are new and working out the bugs. We will be back to try it again soon.",

    "text": "Smash Burger is in the same vein as Fat Burger and Create: a quality (but expensive for fast food) burger joint.  It probably deserves 3 1/2 stars--putting it ahead of Fat Burger and on par with Create.    Which isn't to say that Smash Burger is only a simple burger place.  They have salads, chicken sandwiches and a decent variety of toppings (think full classic selection of toppings and choice of buns, but not a cornucopia of exotic toppings).  Generally, Smash Burger has adopted the classic, simple and clean style of a fast food burger joint and improved on the quality of the ingredients.      Ground beef should not simply be a carrier for the flavor of toppings and Smash Burger gets this.  (Applause sign lights up).  The burger meat is tasty and fresh (not a frozen patty) and I assume that it is full fat because the meat itself is delicious and quite flavorful.  I ordered their signature Smash Burger (cheeseburger with tomato, onion, lettuce, pickles, \"smash sauce\" and ketchup).  That's a lot of sauce on one burger, but I could still taste the patty--rich and peppery, textured but not overcooked.  And Smash Burger does love pepper.  The patty had a distinct peppery taste and a similar seasoning showed up on the sweet potato fries.  So, if you order a burger, know that you will have to enjoy pepper.  They do have an inventive list of sides for a fast food place (fried asparagus or fried pickles anyone?).  We went with the sweet potato fries and Smash Burger did a good job.  The fries weren't as crispy as I would have liked, but the seasoning was peppery and delicious.  It more than made up for my floppy fries.  We topped this all off with a vanilla malt, which was excellent (but, honestly every malt is usually awesome).  All in all, it's a solid on-the-go burger joint.  It can't touch the best Vegas has to offer, but for the price it offers a great experience.  Next time, I think I'll try their Spicy Baja burger and see how the patty does with jalapenos on top.",

The brussel sprouts tasted and felt like hard leftovers from last week and the blackbean burger tasted like they spilt salt on it. Almost unbearable to eat.

Soon after that another one came in and she yelled at my wife again, to wait until the next one was tended to.   The grilled cheese was prepared on a dirty griddle, the goat cheese burger was basically cheeseless and the triple was cold. Everything took three trips to the kitchen and returned worse every time.  Unprofessional. Unapologetic. Exscusive. Unreliable. Untimely and horrendous service.  This was a killjoy experience and I hope no one else has to go through the same.",

Fries were greasy as hell and luke warm. Not a big complaint if meal was 12 bucks or so but we didnt even get drinks and meal was $24 . Im finding more and more i would rather just go get bar food.

Visited on Tuesday 8-23-16 around 6PM. $26.32 got us a kids grilled chicken meal, a milkshake, a chicken sandwich with fries, and a cobb salad.    Yes, I had a salad and a milkshake.  Don't you judge me.  I see you over there with your judge-y looks.    $7.99 classic cobb salad - Menu says it has fresh greens, a fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes, onions, cheddar and blue cheese topped with buttermilk ranch dressing.  I asked for no blue cheese and chose crispy chicken to go on top.    When my salad arrived I was a bit perplexed....there was a big scrambled egg sitting on top next to the chicken.  The menu says it's supposed to be fried and I guess they broke the yolk and just said \"fuck it\" and threw it on my salad.  I never thought I would say I have eaten scrambled eggs on salad but...there ya go.  Those are the cards I was dealt.  I didn't say anything to the staff about it...I just sat there and ate my weird-ass salad.  Their ranch dressing is gross...tastes like hidden valley.  They use spring mix lettuce and the chicken was perfectly cooked...moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside.    We split a $4.29 chocolate banana milkshake and it was perfect.  I like how they serve the milkshake in a glass and give you the leftovers from the metal mixer container.  It makes it really easy to split between two people.    My husband got \"veggie frites\" instead of fries and they were delicious and next time I go back I'm going to just get a basket of those and not share with anybody.  They were green beans and carrots shaped like fries and sauteed to perfection.  They taste almost exactly like green beans from a cheap chinese buffet, which I love.      So from now on Imma stick to burgers here because they are delicious.  That's what I get for ordering a salad at a burger place.",

Not only was the patty amazing but all the ingredients were very fresh and had crunch! Excellent presentation! Smash tots were great, very buttery and crunchy at the same time. The rosemary is not overpowering. They really have it down to a science here. Scott waited on us today as was very informative and helpful with his recommendations. It's our first time here and we will definitely be coming back. 10/10 would recommend thanks Scott!",

    "text": "First Timer at Smash. I was wondering what is different to their Burgers. Well it depends with what chain you will compare it with. I would rank it just a bit over In and out Burger, but only cause you have more options here. The Burger are as well never frozen and deliciously prepared. The actual smashing is more a marketing trick to get a new burger chain on the market and visible. But that doesn't really matter. You can taste that the burger are fresh and nicely grilled.  I would have loved to have a chance to see when they are grilled and prepared as with its possible to most IN-out Burger locations. But it is not possible at least not at this location. I have to check others.  But that said i can finish it off with the verdict: it is simply a good burger for a fast food chain. This location near the UCLA ist clean and the service friendly.",

I had to ask for fresh tires because the first ones they gave were lukewarm and kind of gross. The burger didn't look like how it did in the pictures....  The line to order was extremely slow. It was prime lunch time and there were a lot of people in line with only one person working the register while another stepped in for about 2 customers and then left into the kitchen. If I knew I would wait so long, I would have just called ahead or got my food delivered. The workers didn't seem to want to be there, and seemed like they had zero motivation.   For the area, the price is average but the portion sizes don't really make up for it.",

Makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  I like to order their truffel mushroom burger because it has MUSHROOMS! I love mushrooms on a burger from just about anywhere. The one at Smashburger is no exception. It is loaded with them. They are buttery and garlicy. Whats not to love? Order it with sweet potato smash fries and you are in for a decadent fast food treat.

    "text": "What I ordered: Baja chicken smashburger with lettuce wrapped with no bun (gluten issue). Item should have a chicken patty, guacamole, Chipotle mayo, lettuce, onion, pepperjack cheese and tomato wrapped in lettuce.  What I received:' Thin piece of gristly chicken, pepperjack cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, JALEPENO slices (not a listed ingredient on the menu) with NO guacamole and NO mayo with a side of ranch.   When asked about the first girl quickly dodged me saying she was new (understandable) the second girl had me dissect my chicken sandwich to prove the ingredients were indeed missing. I also pointed out the addition of fresh jalapenos and showed her that the ingredient was not listed as an item in the menu to which she replied \"yes they are\" so I again pointed to the menu and showed her it was not listed as an item, to which she replied \"ohh but they are and ingredient\" and ip suggested adding it to the ingredients list on the menu. I also ordered vedgie frites that were basically just deep fried green beans anad a couple carrort slices that were just greasy and very undercooked. The chicken was very gristly I ended up throwing it out and getting something else for lunch. This place sure has gone downhill, I won't be eating here again.",

But when Fried Pickles were the highlight of the meal it's not a good sign, afterall their name isn't Smash Pickle.  The burger was OK, I've had better, the way they prep them is a little odd, They take black angus beef and slam it onto a hot griddle, it's all smooshed down, and while the crispy char on the outside is nice, the burger came out a little dry for my liking.  The fries were nothing great, and as I stated earlier the Fried Pickles were the highlight of the meal.  The place is quite small, and even after bussing most of the tables were still drity.   In a city with a million burger places you need to do something to stand out and I don't think they did.",

SO scrumptious! I really like how you can choose which kind of bun you would like. The wheat one is really good to me, it might be called multigrain, but I cannot remember, only that it was tasty.   I have been told the burgers are great, so that will be my next meal hopefully, though those grilled chicken they offer is quite amazing and I love my chicken! And I might try a milkshake one day, but only if I can share it with someone like they did the 50s. That would be super awesome.  I do feel the price is a little steep and it took a super long time to get my food to go, I will still be back. Most definitely for those AMAZING fries!",

The goat cheese and spinach sandwich got me addicted to goat cheese. This sandwich is just really good and the ingredients are superb. I have yet to try the salad version of the sandwich. I know these probably are not healthy, but the smash fries (with olive oil and rosemary) are amazing (I just keep telling myself that olive oil is good for you...).",

While I was driving in my car, I was munching on the smash fries. Too much rosemary, not enough salt. Just not good flavor, which left me thinking the burger would be mediocre as well.  When I got to my destination, I unwrapped the burger. It looked super greasy and unappealing, but whoa! Seriously the best burger that I have ever had! It melted in my mouth, which almost seems impossible for a burger, but it did. The bun is soft and fresh. The meat is juicy and full of flavor. Altogether, amazing!   Someone said it's not as good as Five Guys - Wrong! The actual burger is better than In-N-Out (had it for lunch the same day, so it was fresh in my memory), Shack Shake in New York, Five Guys, Grind Burger, Burger Bar, etc.  Pass on the fries. They need to work of those! The root beer float you can make on your own.   Yes it is pricey, but it's gourmet. Totally worth it.",

    "text": "While in line for in and out my friend asked me if I've ever tried smashburger. I hadn't so I looked at the menu online. Being hungry I just agreed cause the line at in and out was wrapped around the building. When we pulled up to Smash there wasn't a soul in sight. That should have been a sign of something. Dining room was clean and we were greeted promptly and told they would be right with us. There were only 3 tables occupied in the entire building but the staff was flustered and in panic mode trying to run food, answer the phone, and god knows what else. FINALLY we were asked to place out order. Staff was knowledgeable on the menu and offered suggestions and upsells. I ordered a burger for my dog plain but was told about the \"Fido\" burger (not on the menu) was told it was a plain burger with no seasoning for $2.00. So I got 2. My friend knew that would cause jealousy at the house so we ordered 3 more for the other pups at home. We each got the sin city burger, hers with no egg. After a SUPER long wait we got our greese soaked paper bags.......... (like REALLY soaked). Got back to the house and began eating. My burger was ok...... nothing remarkable (Double Double animal style is FAR BETTER) Fries were ok but I got the Olive oil and rosemary ones....... the cup they came in had at least 1/4 cup of I guess a mixture of fry greese and olive oil which made me have to throw most of them away. My friends burger had a big ol fried egg on it so she was bummed out. When it came time to dish out the \"Fido burgers\" I saw that it was just 5 beef patties in a salad bowl......... that's not what was described. Anyways I guess the lesson is to read the reviews and go where the line is, cause the food and service is probably worth the wait.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I am a fan of Smashburger, but it's not the best burger I've ever had or will have for that matter. It is definitely a huge step above In & Out and about as good as it gets for \"fast food.\" The Smash fries are absolutely fantastic! Little crunchy gems tossed in rosemary, olive oil, and garlic. I am pretty sure I could eat a barrel of them by myself. The burgers aren't bad either. I tend to favor the mushroom and swiss burger. My husband opts for the BBQ, bacon, and cheddar with a chipotle bun, just the right amount of spicy and savory.   We have also tried the sweet potato fries and the haystack onions, both of them are OK but nothing special. I have also indulged in the fried pickles, which are overly salty to the point where they are almost inedible. However, if we are talking flavor then this is one of the best, if not the best, fast food burger and fries out there.",

Then, I had a burger somewhere on Decatur that tasted fishy and that was the last time I ate there a few years ago. I decided to give them another try recently. There still not as great as my first experiences and are just OK. I don't think I'll give them another try.",

They offer three sises.  What ruined it for me is that they have you put your condiments on.  I put too much on and their Smashburger brand ketchup came running out.  The pickles were really good and I would go back to try the fried pickles. The egg bun was good.  I needed more red onion slice.  I ordered the skinny salty  fries that I liked at first, but then they were just airy.  The young man working there, Anthony, is committed to making their burger the best.  Thank you for the great, warm hospitality.",

Well for Memorial day they were offering free burgers to Military persons, so I told my husband, hey lets go check it out, it's free!  We already peeped out the menu on line so we knew what we were getting. OMG! This is now our favorite burger place here in LV. It had alot of flavor, tasted old fashioned. The buns were so soft! I was really shocked at the flavor. I got the Baja spicy burger, but with american cheese! Just awsome! My husband got the All American burger, and he really liked it. We also got the rosemary french fries.....no big deal on that flavor, next time I will just get the regular fries.  Ohhhh yea, we will be back!",

Me and bob were walking from the bank, both of our stomach growled, it was so funny, we were hungry for something filling, so we looked around to see what was near us, we saw a In and out burger and right next to it was a smash burger, our eyes lit up. I been craving a good burger. I wanted to try the spicy Baja,(was 5.99 since I got the smash size) I was on a diet, but it looked good so I got that, my bob ordered the bacon cheeseburger(was $6.99 big smash) and a large drink  which was $1.89. Came out to to 14.87 which is not bad if you want a really good burger.  The tables were nice and clean and customer service was good, but I wasn't say great cause they kept on passing us by when we wanted something.   We sat right in the middle, our burger's were ready in 15 min, which was great cause we were starving, Were are not crazy about the fries, so we just got the burger. They were so messy, so glad that they had napkins on each table. I loved there sauces, I was a happy girl when I got done eating that burger, so was bob. I think I will get that Spicy Baja again, was SO GOOD, I recommend it!!  This place is perfect for a little snack or if you are on a budget, its a little bit more for the burger's but hey, its worth it. Your mouths will be watering for there taste!  (sorry I didn't take any pics) I will try to next time I go out.",

I'd say on par or better than most chicken sandwiches at fast food joints. The milkshake and rootbeer float were both very good.",

The staff are friendly and helpful, both important qualities that can make or break my experience from the get go. The food though, oh lordy, the food!  First, the burger.  Normally I try to get anything with egg on it, because eggs are wonderful and delicious, and this burger is awesome. breaded onions, onions, cheese, beef, bacon and an egg make up the components of this item, and I love it! I never finish it in one sitting, as I'm full by the time I'm halfway. It is amazing, I can't even elaborate further on it.  Second, the Nutter Butter milkshake. Quite possibly the greatest shake I've ever had in my life. It tastes exactly how you'd imagine it to be, the nutter butter flavor lingers after each swallow and it makes me happy.  I'm hopefully moving, and though this establishment is already fairly close to my home, the prospect of being a block or so away makes me giddy with excitement. If you haven't been here, you need to go.",

So we trekked over even though I was not in the mood for another burger place.  I was pleasantly surprised...  They are located by UNLV, not far from InNOut.  I do love my burgers but was not feeling a burger that day so when we arrived and saw that they also had chicken burgers, I was in.  I got the Spicy Baja smashchicken, it had a grilled chicken breast with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun AND sweet potato smash fries.  The chicken was moist and the burger had great flavor but I would've preferred it spicier as the jalapenos had no kick for me at all, but nothing a little tapatio wont cure. The sweet potato smash fries though were AWESOME- they are tossed in rosemary, olive oil and garlic.  The mister had he Buffalo Smashchicken, also grilled chicken breast with Frank's buffalo sauce, crumbled blue cheese, lettuce, tomato, may on a egg bun.  He really enjoyed his also.  Next time, I'm going to try the Sin City and smash fries! AND you can build your own burger too so that is always a PLUS.",

I got my own jab in when asked if my order was for here or to go. \"For here...although technically I will be taking it with me when I leave.\" Hey-O!  I had the BBQ, Bacon, Cheddar big burger. It was outstanding. I also got a regular order of the Smashfries. I really liked the Smashfries although the portion was really small. Yeah, I got the regular size, but it was smaller than I expected. They lost a star for that.  Overall though, very good food, very friendly and fun staff, and this particular location was very clean.  I'll definitely be back.",

Fries were pretty good as well. And the shakes!!!! Wheeeeeeeww!! As said by Terry Crews in The Longest Yard, \"I got the shakes that'll make you quake!!!\". No joke, these shakes are another reason to visit here lol. Everyone should try at least once....or twice...ok 3 times!! Get yo smash on!!",

    "text": "After our disappointment at the over hyped In-n-Out, there was another burger joint that I wanted to try since we're in the west coast. Hopefully this place would make up for the other day's burger...  Sister and I ordered the Sin city smash burger 1/3 pound and it was not bad! It's on the salty side, though. If the burger didn't have any bacon on it, then it would be perfect. It is not your clean, petite, cute burger. It's greasy, artery clogging, and bold junk for your tummy.  The fries were pretty solid, waaay better than In-n-Out's, whose fries reminds me of eating styro foam. It has a flavorless and weird texture IMO.   The fried pickles from here are not special and we could've done without. They were not crispy, barely battered and rather pickly (you know, sour and pickled lol).   All in all, I was satisfied after devouring the helluva burger from here. Satisfied, but guilty. I might need to run 5 miles to jump start my digestion, though. Prior to entering this place, I joked with my sister and said, \"I hope this place doesn't make us take one\".. (....you know, ...a smash? ha-ha) and it didn't! I know, I'm gross.  BTW, one reviewer mentioned that you have to clean up after yourself? I asked the cashier just to be sure and was told to leave my trays where they were.",

    "text": "I go by this place almost every week. Tonight was my first time stepping inside.  The layout confused me at first, I wanted to walk straight ahead after entering the doors. Then my friend waived me over to the left side where the menu was on the wall. The counter where you order is near that.  I like the simplicity of the menu. Either pick a burger that they've created or make up your own burger with different options/toppings. What I did not really like was that the server at the counter did not know what \"gluten-free\" meant. He had a very \"wtf??\" look on him. He went in the back to talk with the cook, then came back and brought out the employee handbook. We then flipped through it to find their allergen section.   Here's what I can remember from the handbook: * Angus burgers are okay when ordered without the bun and without \"fried toppings\" like the haystack onions * You might have issues with cross-contamination as everything is cooked on the same grill * Fries are not okay and there's obvious cross-contamination in the fryer * Premium and malt milkshakes are not okay (obvious reasons)  We were in a dangerous mood, so we stayed and ordered. My gluten-free friend ordered a Sin City burger, sans onions, sans bun. I got the \"Rebel Special\" all-American burger, sans bun. I also added an egg on top.  The burgers came out on a plate. I was expecting it to be wrapped in lettuce, so it would be more burger-like, but it was like an open-faced sandwich -- or rather, a hamburger steak with toppings. We were given forks and knives to eat it with. Should have taken a pic, but we were starving.  My \"burger\" was decent. It had cheese, pickles, raw red onions, and some ketchup/mustard. The egg went really well with the burger. My only gripe was that the burger meat itself was a tad over-seasoned. Not sure how my friend's burger was, but he scarfed it down quick.  The cost for all this was about $20 (including drinks and a regular shake). Worth it? I don't know. But it was nice to have a \"gourmet\" burger for once.",

Two of my children (in their 20's) along with my wife and a newborn granddaughter checked this place out on a Monday morning around 10 am, they open at 10 am. I decided on the Buffalo burger, regular fries, and a Vanilla Milkshake, my wife ordered the Classic with Haystack Fries, (which are shoestring type onion rings), my son-in law ordered the \"Sin City\", with a root beer float (Hagen-das ice cream), my daughter got a Classic with Smash fries, and root beer float. The total for this visit $47.97. I check out the facilities before eating to just wash my hands and get an over view of everything. The restroom was very dirty, especially the corners and the walls, I won't describe it was just bad. They do have a sign indicating they want to be notified if the restrooms are dirty, but who are you really going to tell with one person talking orders, a line of people in front of her and no one else within eye sight. I liked everything I ordered, the fires are salted with sea salt, I should have asked for no salt. They were very salty; my wife didn't care for the grilled onion on her burger and the Haystack fries tasted like a squirt of grease with every bite. My son in- law loved every bite; my daughter said she loved it all, but I tasted her Smash fries and I didn't care for the herbs and spray of olive oil on them. Our granddaughter sleeps through it all, YES. They offer fry sauce, it has a horsey radish taste to it, not for me. Basically, my wife and didn't care for this new restaurant and our children loved it. For the money I could think of a lot of other places to eat lunch.",

But their advertising is pretty bad and their availability for ingredients is not great. I had to check out online what to expect, seeing thatmany metropolitan cities have a Smash Burger, I found that the San Diego smash burger looked most appealing, but when I tried to order it in Las Vegas, they didn't have a clue. Their centralized website should give the locations a source to look up that info. I mean, I can understand, for example, if Boston had a clam chowder smash, I wouldn't expect Phoenix to have one, but simple things like cilantro should be available. Their gimmick for smashing their burger pinching out the fat  is not bad; I like to get a bite of meat with every bite. I'm not crazy about their atmosphere, but to each their own.",

When I came in to pick it up the line was nearly out the door so I asked if I could just pay, without standing in line (since my food was all ready just sitting on the counter in bags) and just grab the food. The girl there said she only had one register open and I had to wait in line. So as I wait for about 15 people, think, decide and pay, my food is getting colder and then by the time it's my turn she opens up another register! Really? She couldn't do that 15 people ago when my food was luke warm?!? Then as I'm carrying a drink and my hands are obviously full another girl tries to load all the bags into my hands. I nearly dropped everything. I'm 7 months pregnant so it's obvious I'm struggling and they don't even offer to help me out or leave my bags or drinks to make a few trips... NOTHING. By the time I ate the food, the fries were undercooked and freezing and the rest of the food was also very cold. They also messed up about 1/3 of the order. It was $114+ order; you'd think that they would have a little better customer service.",
