I love to sit by the bar and it's perfect for a quick bite (try the Cuban sandwich or the steak sandwich) or a date. The drinks are good and the coconut mojito is bomb. For dinner I really enjoy the sample platter. 10 out of 10 would recommend. Try the Cuban. Do it for your tastebuds",

    "text": "Visiting Vegas and wanted to try something different so we went to Cuba Cafe.  We had the sandwich Cubano, Media-Noche sandwich, an order of tostones, an order of moro rice, and the fried pork tapa which I requested with rice.    My dining companions had the sandwiches and while the sandwiches were good, they were not stellar.  Have had better sandwiches.  The moros rice was good, but an average good.  Tostones were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Very nice.  The garlic sauce that came with the tostones was not good. It was just the commercial store purchased chopped garlic which doesn't taste the same as fresh garlic. Not a smart way to cut costs. The tapas came with two small pieces of pork and the rice and beans. The two pieces of pork were enough for me but it was not as tasty as I expected it to be. This dish at $8.99 is a bit pricey.  I found the pricing in general to be a little high for the area and the ingredients of the dish.  Let's face it rice, beans and pork are relatively inexpensive. I don't think Cuba Cafe would be my choice again considering that Las Vegas has several other Cuban spots.",

We had the following:  Beef Empanada $4.75  Sopa De Pollo $5.50  Chicken Chipotle Sandwich $7.95  Tasting Plate $16.95  The empanada was delicious! It was definitely homemade and fried perfectly with no trace of excess oil. The chicken soup was good but i wish they used fresh veges instead of frozen peas and carrots. My tasting plate consisted of shredded beef, roasted pork, and grilled chicken. It came with rice, beans, and fried bananas. I thought it was really good and enough to share for 2 hungry people. The meats were very flavorful and i loved the fried bananas. My wife said her chicken sandwich was good too. I think this place is very authentic and the food is great.",

Their take on macitas is a lot nicer than many places I've been, where the pork is kind of swimming in garlic oil. Theirs has a great mojo criollo flavor without the oil! I personally like the onions a bit less cooked, but that's no biggie.  Both the maduros and tostones are quite nice as are the moros.  No complaints at all!",

We came in and were seated immediately, given menus and drinks to start. The servers weren't very friendly and didn't seem to enjoy their job at all. No worries I can deal with that, but I cant deal with bland rubbery chicken which is what came with my tasting  plate. It came with rice and beans fried plantain ropa vieja, lechon asado, and tequila pollo. The chicken was rubbery, the pork (lechon asado) was lacking in flavor and the ropa vieja just had a weird taste to it. The salad was ok but I didn't like it very much either and that's weird because I love salad. The offered us bread halfway through eating our entrees. It needed a sauce for dipping it was boring on its own. My boyfriend loved the lechon asado he ordered but for me it was one of the worst meals I had in a long time. Overall the service was subpar and the food mediocre I don't know why they're so highly rated but I guess everyone's opinion is different.",

The place was cozy overall and our waiter was on top of things. Being a native Floridian who recently moved to Vegas, I've been on the prowl for some good Cuban food. My husband ordered the Ropa Vieja and myself the grilled chicken dish. Both were excellent. The rice wasn't anything special but the meat was delicious. We also ordered the chicken empanadas which I loved and a side of plantains and cassava. The side dishes were too pricey. We didn't order any alcohol, just iced tea and the bill was nearly 60.00. That was too much in my opinion. I don't know that I'll be back but if you are in Vegas and have a hankering for some Cuban food, this is the only viable option. Also the Cuban bread came out grilled and buttered which was odd to me. I've always had it served fresh with butter on the side. Overall, a decent experience.",

Can't compare it to much, and can't specify whether it is authentic or not, but since it didn't taste much like anything else I've had before, I would think yes!  First up is the complimentary Cuban bread...yum! It was super soft, flavorful and slightly sweet... without butter! Next time I should order a plate of this and eat it for dinner lol.  I wanted to try their version of ceviche :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cuba-cafe-restaurant-las-vegas?select=ITCFfFj3Ld3slT4V0v8kyA#ITCFfFj3Ld3slT4V0v8kyA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cuba...</a>  Not sure if this is how they do it in Cuba, but there was almost no citrus flavor at all! It was good, but there was a mayo-like sauce all over it, and it didn't have that slight bite that I have grown to love in Mexican style ceviche.  We ordered the Tasting Plate appetizer platter, which came with Beef Empanadas, Mariquitas and Croquetas :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cuba-cafe-restaurant-las-vegas?select=6-X7yQIAcyAHpDA9LJwQ0A#6-X7yQIAcyAHpDA9LJwQ0A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cuba...</a>  Empanadas were good, but the Croquetas were great....filled with Ham and Beef. Empanadas were a little bready, so I didn't eat the crusts..but the insides were yummy.  And to finish, we ordered another Tasting Plate with Ropa Vieja, Lechon Asado & Pollo Tequila with Moros Cristianos and Maduros :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cuba-cafe-restaurant-las-vegas?select=KeTx5zyAkYesrDvHzq3qnQ#KeTx5zyAkYesrDvHzq3qnQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cuba...</a>  The Pollo was ok...a little overcooked and all the flavor was in the sauce. The Lechon was good...My favorite was the Ropa Vieja! It was a rich and slightly spicy shredded beef simmered with onions & peppers. Yum!  I took off a star for service...or lack thereof.  We ordered the ceviche before the rest of the courses, and since this is \"cooked\" hours before, this should have been very simple to toss on a plate and send our way.  But ALL of the food showed up at once...the appetizer, the second appetizer, and the main course.  The waitress had a very surprised look when I made eye contact, and then the food came almost immediately after...something tells me it was waiting for a while.  Overall, I will still come back...but maybe Cuban food isn't for me?",

I have loved everything I have tried, the lechon asado, the bistec, the chicken, and most of all the ropa vieja.  Dishes come with \"moros y christianos\" the black beans and rice side dish that would be a wonderful meal all by itself. The service is good, attentive but not overbearing, they fill your water or drink glass as needed, gently inquire if everything is satisfactory, and hover in the background waiting to fulfill any need. The buttered toasty bread brought to the table to start is also quite good. For dessert we had the flan, and I was also very happy with that, a perfect creamy, caramel flavor bomb. We have a cuban place in San Diego that I visit, but this one is worth a trip of 300 miles just for the delicious food.",

If you don't feel like sandwiches, there's plenty of other things to order like the mango salmon and lemon-cilantro mahi mahi; and you can ask for some free bread or banana chips to go along with your entree.  The restaurant has a real \"hole in the wall\" feeling which I love; great photos hanging on the wall and a beautiful dim setting with the sun light peering through the windows.  The only complaint I have is that the steak can be a little bit on the tough side.",

From the outside this cafe looks like a ghetto bail bonds fast food take out.  But when you walk into the cafe you smell the amazing food and the decor is a cafe in Cuba.  At 2:00pm on a sunday this place was buzzing with people.  I ordered the picture on the front page of the menu.  Some kind of roast pork.  My girl friend and her boy friend ordered the tasting plate to share and got a side of the Lamb appetizers.  The bread is buttered and crunchy.  My fav!  My Pork meal was delicious!  The meat was tender and juicy.  Full of flavor.  Comes with rice and beans and a side salad.  The tasting plate was pretty good.  Comes with the pork also and two other meats, rice&beans, salad, and plantain.  The Lamb chops (2 pieces) was what stole the show.  We ordered medium and it came medium rare.  How lamb so be.  Flavor again was out of this world.  Lamb is my favorite thing to order but also the hardest thing to get right.  They lamb is great.  5 stars!  Service is friendly and warm.  Lunch for 3 $43+tax and tip...$54",

The service is super friendly, and always very helpful with disabled visitors (mom).  The combo flan/tres leche dessert along with the mamey shake will make you forget about all the cash you have left in Vegas.

Not far off from the strip and UNLV, this place has been in service for quite some time.

I usually get the Pan con Bistec (steak sandwich) or the Pan con Lechon (roasted pork sandwich).  While I have had much better of both, the other Cuban restaurants in town are so mediocre that I settle for Cuba Cafe.  Make sure you ask for a side of mojo or any sauce they have with the sandwiches.  They are rather dry otherwise.    The empanadas are one of the high points for Cuba Cafe, as well as the croquetas.  Both are a little more expensive than I'd like to pay, but are good nonetheless.  Also get an Iron Beer while you're here.  It's not beer, it's a Cuban soda.    This restaurant probably would only get 2 stars, but it's much better than the other Cuban restaurants I've been to in town.",

Like I won't want to eat one from anywhere else because any other one will suck in comparison.  That good.  It was a substantial sandwich: plenty big enough to share.  In hindsight, however,  I wish I would've ordered one all to myself.  Not that I could've finished the whole thing in one sitting.  I just would've loved to have whipped out the second half for a late night room snack.    The key ingredient that made this sandwich so special was the roast pork.  It was simply the most perfect roast pork you could possibly imagine (and I'm giving you credit for an excellent imagination).  The sandwich was pressed, as Cubanos always are, and it was impossible to understand how much meat was packed inside just by looking at it.  But once you started eating it, it became clear that there was a hell of a lot of meat in there.  The sandwich was quite filling.  We started with an order of croquettes.  My wife thought they were just OK.  I thought they were really very good.  The other highlight of the meal was the house made Lemonade.  I have never had any lemonade like this.  It tasted exactly like the lemon dream pie my mom makes.  I have no idea how they make that lemonade, but definitely one of the most unique and one of the tastiest I've ever tried.

    "text": "Let me add something here.  Cuba Cafe' has some seriously good Cuban food.  There has been some migration of Cubans and Cuban-Americans from Florida, providing more choices in Cuban food to this growing metro area, and that's a good thing.  While I may stick to ropa vieja, my friend went with the vaca frita.  Translated, \"vaca frita\" means \"fried cow.\"  That's not appealing, but then \"ropa vieja\" means \"old clothes.\"  I got to sample a forkful or two of that vaca frita and I would make it my first choice for lunch or dinner going forward.  The service by the main waiter/server was quick, spirited, and on point.  There was some sharing of duties with someone who performed a host type function and took orders for drinks and any appetizers.  We did order some croquetas.  They never arrived.  While I often use the expression \"on intravenous demerol\" for people who appear to be checked out, I'd say this individual, despite being very nice, had some \"deer in the headlights\" stuff going on instead.  This turned out to be a fortuitous event.  Between the main platter and some flan, we didn't have any room for those croquetas, despite how good they generally are.  My friend told me that another excursion to Cuba Cafe' was undertaken solo the following week.  It was for the purpose of eating some of that vaca frita again.  I think I might dream of that vaca frita tonight.",

    "text": "After visiting Cuba in May, I was desperately craving some authentic Cuban food. Since I was at UNLV, I figured I would try this location. I walked in with my brother and we were told to sit wherever. We sat towards the back of the cafe, which was a mistake. For starters, I felt like we were \"out of sight out of mind\" to the wait staff, as it took 15 minutes to get our drink orders. Also, they seem to have a scent diffuser back there, so with every bite I got a perfumey taste. Yuck.   The food was good but I didn't really feel like it was made fresh. It definitely didn't have the authentic feel, and after ordering a few items from the tapas menu our total came out to $40, which seemed ridiculous. The entrees were extremely pricey, and I wasn't hungry enough for their portion sizes.   I'd be willing to give this location a second shot, maybe I just caught them on an off day. I'd like to try their entrees, too, to see how they compare.",

I grew up eating Puerto Rican traditional dishes and on vacays going to Cuban family owned restaurants in Orlando. The friendly workers split our taster plates on two separate plates for my grandparents who were sharing the \"Sampler plate\" which is delicious. Everyone was very sweet and would compliment me on my Afro, I felt like I was right back in Florida, I was accepted. I would love to come back when I'm in town! I ordered the Pollo Fricase with nergo y habichuelas, Black beans and rice. It was so delicious and tasted and looks like what my mom cooks at home. I wasn't a fan of the salad but that's ok! To each is own. I took a couple bites of it, I felt it was rather sweet for my taste. I had a rather large group +4 and my table felt spacious yet intimate. I liked it! And it seemed like my grandparents knew the owners as well. Well I can't wait to go back!  I must return for more tostones with mojo! It taste just like what my mom makes at home! Add some Huy Fong Chili Paste! For a kick of spice",

If you're trying this place out, get them! We also tried some Cuban soda and it was so good too! Four stars because our server was not great, we saw her maybe one time to take our order and the rest of the time she sat at a table chit chatting with coworkers. However, the guy who was bussing tables and working the bar brought our food out and was so so nice and accommodating even though there was a slight language barrier. He was really attentive and made our visit a great one.",

We had two of the tasting plates, which include ropa vieja and chicken and I ordered the ropa vieja. Rice and beans are perfect, and the salad was very well seasoned. I had to guard my precious platanos maduros (a generous serving of one of my favorites) from my chowhound companions.  I had a riesling and my husband had a good but not strong mojito.  I really really enjoyed the generous space between tables, for you get just the right amount of privacy, and I cannot abide sitting elbow to elbow with other diners.  One observation, which is easily reparable, is the lack of lighting for reading the laminated menu. It was dark in the restaurant. I can generally read well but it should not be required that a patron use a flashlight to read. This darkness, however, and the distance between tables, makes for a very nice intimacy. This was a very nice experience, and especially remarkable as my husband, a really tough reviewer, really enjoyed the meal.",

I ordered the Tasting Plate for $14 which was way more than enough to satiate my craving for meat. Everything was cooked to amazing perfection. The dish included a salad, some rice, three types of meat, and some fried plantains? I gobbled the whole thing up and left very full.  With that being said, don't come to this place expecting cool ambiance or stellar service or anything. This is a classic Vegas establishment that you can tell has been there for quite some time. Feels very local.   If you are the type of person who thinks food comes first, you'll absolutely love Cuba Cafe.",

Started with the appetizer we ordered the Tapas sampler  platter which had Banana chips,Empanada(Beef),Potato stuffed with beef and deep fried beef stick. They serve it with garlic sauce drizzled in olive oil and another specialty sauce, The items on the plate were just getting better tasting than the other after each bite.For our Entree The \"Lechon Asado\"(Shredded Pork) was wonderful. I personally ordered the \"Ropa Vieja\" (Old Rope shredded beef) which is one of my favorite cuban dishes cause it has a similarity to the American \"Beef Stew\"or \"Mechado\"  from the Philippines. When it was served to me It didn't have the overflowing sauce that I had expected. But to my amazement as soon as I took a bite of the beef with the \"Moros\"(rice&beans) It was euphoric. We also tried the \"Mame\" shake a fruit similar to a \"Chico\" from the Philippines they both come from the same fruit genome. It was all tremendously delicious!  Try it and you will never regret it!",

The yuca mojo was delicious and not dry at all, with this great garlic sauce that didn't overpower the yuca but allowed you to enjoy the taste of yuca. The avocado salad was excellent. Croquettes pretty crispy and plump. The papa rellena was one of my favorites but I think the ultimate was their empandas. There were crispy, not greasy, and really packed in with meat, there were just like my home made memories but even better.   My only complaint was that this place is awfully pricy compared to cuban places in LA, it cost almost $60 for the two of us for lunch! I mean its good but now you are just milkin the tourists.",

Ropa vieja is fantastic, the cuban sandwich is the best we've tried in Vegas (they use tender chunks off the bone instead of slices.)   The coffe is INCREDIBLE, as is the tirmasu. It's cakelike instead of puddingy, just YUM. They also have a vanilla ice cream desert with warm strawberries and cinnamon- not only is it delicious but it's also perfect to share on a date.

There isn't a single cuban in there, but most importantly, the staples of the cuban cusine aren't done right (or absent...where is the vaca frita?) We tried the \"tapas combo\" (platanutres, croqueta, papa rellena, empanada). The papa rellena and croqueta were very good and well made. The empanada was NOT a cuban empanada. The cuban empanadas are fried, not baked.   The cuban sandwich was surprisingly tasteless and the pork was cut too thick for a sandwich. My husband got the combo with some chicken cooked with tequila that was tough and tasteless, the roasted pork was bland and it did not have any crispy part in it (it looked like boiled meat). The ropa vieja, on the other hand, was good.  Considering the reviews here, we very disappointed. We won't be back.",

I started with  the pork ribs.  Not a lot of sauce and they are oven cooked, so no smoky taste, but they were cooked properly and had a nice texture. They also same with a small scoop black beans and rice and a small salad.  I could have had that as just a meal for $5.95, but I wanted to try more things/ I then had the combination plate that had an empanada, plaintain chips and several deep fried items.  Were they good?  I ate them all!   There are a large number of items that I would love to try so I will go back there with friends. The service was also friendly, but sometimes there were a few stumbles with the language barrier, but all of my items were correct and I got to practicando mi espagnol.",

My nana was Cuban and the food here brings it pretty close to her home cooked meals. The service has always been friendly and the restaurant well kept with a very inviting decor. I've recommended and brought many friends and relatives here and they have all agreed that compared to Versailles or other Cuban restaurants we have been too this is by far the Best.   Even my Cuban friends have loved the experience and food here. Today I was back in Vegas and as is usual for me I went in for lunch with a friend who had never had Cuban food. She LOVED IT! The croquetas were delicious, as was my Picadillo (as usual) and the Salmon was exquisite.   When we finished our meal we asked we could we go to catch a cab back to the Treasure Island, the waitress offered to call for one. After waiting no more than 5 minutes the owner Sergio- came out to try to flag one down. Since no one was stopping he then went back into the restaurant, grabbed his keys and told us: \"follow me ladies I will drive you.\" NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!   Thank you Sergio for your kindly driving us back to our hotel. We will definitely remain loyal patrons of your restaurant! Love, Angelica & DeeDee",

It was almost empty when I walked in with my coworker - there was only one table and only one other group walked in while we were there. I ordered the lamb chop tapas and platanos maduros, and my coworker ordered the bistec empanizado.   The bread basket we got was warm and soft. I actually liked it better when it cooled down a little because the bread got crunchier. It was superrr soft  when we first got it.  My lamb chops were good, but not great. There wasn't a crust on it, and it was cooked medium instead of the medium rare I'd ordered it. I loved the plantains.   My coworker didn't really like her steak, but that was because she's THE pickiest eater I've ever met and only really likes healthy food. Over the 3 days I spent with, I realized that she's just horrible at ordering. I tried her steak and it was perfectly fine to me. I kind of wanted some ketchup to go with it, but it was pretty much what I expected. Not too greasy and the breading wasn't soggy.",

Everything was delicious including the mint lemonade - I'll have to go again to try the alcohol - the flavored mojitos sound so good.   We tried the fried plantains which tasted just as good as I've had them in Central America. The yuca fries were good too. I had chicken in mushroom sauce with yellow rice and it was so delicious.

It seemed to be a family run business, which I love.  The service was top great.  The wait staff was on point and we did not have to wait for anything while we were there.  We Made a reservation, but when we arrived there were a few open tables, so we sat right down for dinner.  The brought out some cuban bread for the table which was fantastic!  We ordered the sampler appetizer which was fantastic.  I highly recommend it.  Its like tapas, so you get a little bit of a few cuban traditional apps.      I ordered the dinner sampler as my main course.  It came with cuban style chicken, pork, and ropa vieja.  The were good, but I've had better.  I didn't care too much for the pork, and that is a bummer as I love cuban pork, but the rest was good.  We ordered some cuban sandwiches to go and had them for lunch the next day.  These were delicious and I would definately come back for more of their sandwiches.  Overall I would say the food is above average, with a few items well above average.  The service is an A+.  will definately be back.",

I always say I'm gonna try something else, but I've only ordered the Pan Con Bistec sandwich because even if it's an \"off day\", it just tastes SO goood mmm mm. The last few times I've been there though, the sandwich has been made to perfection...i definitely need to find out who the chef is. Moist juicy steak seasoned to amazingness. If you want the free bread you have to ask for it if you get a sandwich. A side of beans a rice is always complimentary. The platanos are O-kay. I got them once and never ordered them again.  Service is usually friendly, a little slow sometimes though.  Is this the most contradictory review ever? Haha.  They also have a patio if you're interested.",

    "text": "So again following fellow Yelp reviewers you have not led me wrong.  Searching for nearby new places to eat I came along the reviews for here and decided it was time to try some Cuban food.  I have actually pulled into the parking lot thinking about trying this place one other time but didn't so I was happy to give it a shot!   Here is a list of what we tried.  -For appetizers (Tapas) we had Empanadas de res o pollo beef or chicken we had beef.  As one reviewer before me mentioned it was a work of art it was a light crisp crust with a very flavorful filling I could have just had a few of these for dinner.   -Tamal criollo homemade tamale the masa was a darker color with a bit more flavor then what I have had before it was good however it was a bit dry for my taste. -For dinner we followed other reviewers and tried theTasting plate a combo of Roos Vieja, rich spicy beef simmered with onions and peppers.  Pollo Tequila Mar chicken with herbs and a spicy tequila  sauce.  Lechon Asado marinaded pork in a garlic olive oil this was my favorite it reminded me of a well cooked turkey dinner!  Served with Moros Cristianos a black bean rice good but saved that for lunch because this is a TON of food.   Also served with Maduros ( a fried sweet plantain)   All in all the food was good the price was fair for the serving side the ambiance was nice.  It is a busy restaurant a constant flow of people on a Monday night!  The service was good the cooking was a bit on the slow side but like I said they were very busy so I won't fault them for that because they did bring our apps before dinner so we were fine chatting while waited.   I am going back for a lunch of a cuban sandwich soon I can't wait to try that.  I also noticed them bringing out to almost every table the Batidos a Cuban milkshake in many flavors I don't quite know how I am going to fit this all into my stomach but I am going to try.",

I am thinking of anything positive to write about this place......they have a two man band that was pretty good. First and last time for me. Heed the warning.",

They've got sandwiches, plates, rice/beans, kids meals, chicken, fried bananas, dessert, etc.  Definitely worth coming back to try out the other dishes!  I had the chicken plate (I forgot what it was called) that had rice, chicken thighs in a flavorful sauce, and a side salad.  It was pretty good, it was very filling and hit the spot.  The bread that they serve before you get your entree is also VERY GOOD. I have never had bread like that before, it was sweet but also very savory and toasted.  I had to get a second basket because it was that good!  Everything is reasonably priced and service is pretty speedy as well.. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area.  Delicious and authentic food that leaves you feeling satisfied.",

    "text": "I recently read a review on Yelp of the Cuba Cafe.  It's been a long time since I had good Cuban food, and I decided to give this place a try.  I ordered the tasting plate to get an overall of their food.  The tasting plate consists of three meats--lechon asado, pollo tequilla, and ropa vieja.  The lechon was tender and juicy but I didn't get any of the garlic taste that the menu speaks of under that plate.  The pollo was very good and the sauce on it had a nice kick.  Far and away the best part of the plate was the ropa vieja.  This was juicy, tender, and very flavorful.  Along with the plate was a small salad and some rice and beans, the well known moros y cristianos.  There was a basked of cuban bread with the meal also.  For dessert, I had the guava shells with cream cheese.  I had iced tea and it was refilled promptly.  Service was very friendly.  A man and a woman were covering the tables and they worked well in tandem.  I really enjoyed Cuba Cafe and will be back with my wife.",

I have, but didn't want just a Cuban sandwich. Aunt Margie had a sandwich and she said it was good, but not much meat. She also expected peppers on it, but if they were there, finely chopped and cooked in with meat. I had no idea what I was ordering, but the waitress recommended it and it was named for me--pollo la ajillo. It was breaded chicken and fried served with a very garlicky gravy/sauce. Normally I wouldn't order something breaded and fried, but it was very good and I ate the entire generous portion, which also came with a small perfectly dressed side salad. Aunt Shirley had the avocado salad, which looked like a delicious work of art. Sloan ordered the same thing, but only ate half if it. Glad to take the rest home for another meal. Everyone said they'd come back. That's a pretty good testament to how much we enjoyed it.",

Our food took 40 mins to make it was only two sandwiches & two personal pizzas shouldn't have taken that long! The batidos (shake) de mango & mamey were 6$ ...... really was a disappointment never coming back here again. I rather drive to California to my moms or fly to Miami to eat Cuban food.

I really wanted to order the ropa vieja but had a bad experience ordering this dish with Porto's in LA.    The beef empanada was tasty but a little too greasy for me.  The Cuban sandwich was great.  This fulfilled my sandwich craving.  The pork, ham, cheese and pickle blended well together and the bread was nicely done.  I had the opportunity to get a couple bites of the ropa vieja and I regretted the fact that I didn't order it!  It was cooked to perfection.    I would return to this restaurant.

For the uninitiated, the tasting plate is your best choice, both in value and variety. You will get a little bit of everything. Their black beans and rice is very good, although I'm not the hugest fan of cumin in Cuban food. Their lechon asada was melt in your mouth good. If you are looking for the \"old reliable\" of Cuban food, go with Ropa Vieja. The shredded beef is delicious.   I would skip the yucca as it was cooked too long and became mushy. It had a little bit of garlic, but I love my yucca with a ton of garlic. The tostones (plaintain chips) were decent, however, I prefer them crispier.  Just be prepared as the prices are a little bit on the higher side for the food. Entree plates are around $13-15.   The service left plenty to be desired unfortunately. Our server arrived quickly to the table but then proceeded to disappear for at least 20 minutes after we asked for a few more minutes to decide our order. It was hard to actually get our server at the table. The water at the table was never refilled and plates hung out on the table for too long.   It was also a bummer that there was no live entertainment even though I believe Saturday nights were supposed to have live entertainment. The music they piped in got me dancing in my seat so that was a win.   The food is good, service is slow. So hang out, take your time.",

I brought it up to the waitress and she said she brought out the regular plate instead of the tapas . She didn't even offer a discount or apologized for her mistake and I was stuck with a high bill .

    "text": "I wish I could give Cuba Cafe a higher grade, but the service really brought it down. At 2:30 on a Saturday, we were the only customers in the place, and while I know that's a slow time, it seems like we should therefore have had BETTER service, not worse! It took a while to order, and after we did, we had to chase down the servers several times to get refills on our drinks.  While the service was poor, the food was pretty good. Three of my friends had Cuban sandwiches, and--surprisingly--it was the first time for two of them! All three loved them, and I'm glad they now know the power of the Cuban! A fourth friend had the chicken sandwich, which was nothing special; and my husband had the daily deal: pork bruschetta, which was a skewer of tasty marinated pork with peppers and onions. Yum!  I got the tasting plate, which at $16.95 was one of the more expensive items on the menu, but it had an abundance of traditional favorites: ropa vieja (beef), puerco asado (pork), and pollo Grand Marnier (chicken) with rice and beans, sweet plantains, and a nicely dressed lettuce salad. Loved the beef and sides, but the pork and chicken were a bit overdone. I also had a mojito, which was heavy on the mint--but also heavy on the booze!  Overall, I would try Cuba Cafe again, but maybe on a different day or at a different time. (Or maybe they were just having an off day...)",

Having moved from Miami about a month and a half ago, my husband and I have been swimming in a sea of Asian (no hate, I'm half Cuban half Korean) and Mexican food here in Las Vegas, but had yet to find a reliable Cuban place! Our pool guy (also Cuban, you go, Jose!) recommended this place, and it's honestly more than what I could have ever asked for. I'm pretty sure our waiters name was Brownie(?), and not only was he also super excited to meet fellow Cubans, he was a spectacular waiter. Everything he brought was correct, the perfect temp, and tasted delicious. Granted, most of that he had no control over, but that's even better because it shows how well the people in the kitchen are at preparing Cuban dishes. Everything was spot on, from the tamal and Cuban bread, to the masitas de puerco, churrasco con chimi, flan, and of course the cafecito.",

    "text": "Some things change for the better.  Alas, not Cuba Cafe.  I wrote my last review 3 1/2 years ago and gave it four stars.  It's quite a distance from home, so we're not regulars.  I think we were there once after that first visit.  But this time we were meeting friends from Henderson and, like so many from that part of the valley, driving anywhere but nearby is an odyssey to be undertaken, well...never.  So we shlepped to East Tropicana, after convincing them that Cuba Cafe was worth their short drive.  The guys each had a Bud Light, my girlfriend ordered a Pinot Grigio, and I had a German Riesling that was excellent.  So far, so good.  We gave in our orders, and the waitress returned to tell my friend that her Mango Salmon was not to be; they were out of salmon.  She switched to Lechon Asado.  Her husband, Mr. Picky Eater, ordered Rice with Chicken Breast, probably the plainest choice on the menu.  Mine ordered Chicken in Peanut sauce over linguine, and I stayed with the same tasting plate as I had the first time, mainly because I had a hankering for maduros, the sweet plantains.  But there were just two small pieces.  My dish came complete with a serving of...ALUMINUM FOIL, nestled right in the beef.  When I pointed this out, the other waitress snatched it away, saying they'd remake it.  It's noteworthy that from the moment we entered the restaurant until our departure, there was not a scintilla of a smile from either of these two.  It was more like the ice in the water that we weren't served.   My friend said her pork was tender, and she liked her dish.  Mr. Picky picked at his food and said it was okay.  Then again, I've never heard him rave about anything anywhere.  I had some of the linguine dish.  The chicken was very tender, but the linguine were a little too soft for my taste.  Not mushy, but I prefer al dente, which this wasn't.  Though Cuban food is not known for its spice, this was described as having a peanut-chipotle sauce, but there wasn't much chipotle to be found.  My replaced Tasting Plate was okay, sans foil, but was oversalted.  I always turn down water when it's offered, because all I ever drink is wine or coffee, but this time I sure could have used it.  Except it wasn't offered.  At 9 p.m. almost all diners were gone, and that's when an excellent latino band started to play.  I love those congas!!!  Apparently, this place turns into a club on the weekends, when they're open much later, complete with dancing.  My advice, if you're into this kind of music - my personal favorite -  is to go for a drink, the music, and some dancing.  Because if you're there for dinner...  The real \"fun\" started when we got the check, which was delivered without us asking.  No one bothered to ask if we'd like dessert or coffee.  And it was just ONE check. My friend had asked for separate checks right when we ordered.  Moreover, it's a good thing we checked that check, which is probably why it's called \"check\" in the first place.  Two beers had become four.  One pinot grigio became two.  The elusive salmon wasn't in the kitchen, but it was right there on the bill, along with the lechon asado that was substituted.  WTF???  The waitress gave us some double-talk about her ringing up the drinks and the bartender also ringing them up.  And when I asked to see a manager, this very young woman said that she was in charge.  Maybe, but it sure seemed like the other woman was more owner-like.  To their credit, they did make good on the bill by removing the extra drinks, making it two checks, and comping both my friend's and my dish, though we didn't ask for anything except to remove the charges that shouldn't have been there.  Still, it made for a very unpleasant finale to a meal that was in a nice setting but oh, so ordinary.  And I'm still thirsty.",

From the outside, it doesn't look that impressive. It's definitely a hole-in-the-wall sort of place. Once you step inside, though, you find that it has a very intimate and relaxed atmosphere.  The staff is incredibly personable, and the service is great. I don't think it's ever taken more than 10-15 minutes to receive our food. My favorite thing to order is the Cubano with some fried yucca. The yucca comes with a delicious garlic sauce.  I also like to order a Cuban lemonade, which is lemonade blended with some ice and mint. It's incredibly refreshing and pairs well with their food.  I will definitely be coming back to try the rest of their items, and I highly recommend coming here if you're craving delicious Cuban food!",

I realized it was extremely salty once I got halfway in. I thought maybe it was just the citrus sauce they put on top which also tasted weird. Their toasted bread had no butter on it as most Cuban places do. And the staff has no enthusiasm. And idk what Cuban place does this but who in the world serves salad and rice as sides?????? You have to request plaintains instead and the yellow rice had 0 flavor. The salad that truthfully is supposed to come plated separately from hot food, was mostly cabbage. It looked like leafy salad on top and coleslaw on bottom and it had a citrus-vinegarette on it as well. This place doesn't deserve 4 or 5 stars. The people that gave this such high ratings probably have never had Cuban food or we're too drunk to notice how bad the food was. If you want authentic, flavorful Cuban CUISINE. Come to Hesperia, CA and visit Havanazucar Cuban Restaurant. Or visit Ontario, CA and go to Flamingo Palms Cuban Cafe. This place has no passion for Cuban flavor.",

The complimentary bread was warm, crispy yet soft, and buttered goodness! I could just eat it all day but I had to make myself stop and save room for my \"tasting plate.\" So, the tasting plate ($14.95) has 3 different Cuban dishes: ropa vieja, pollo tequila, and lechon asado. Served nice and piping hot, with rice mixed with black beans, a mixed greens salad with vinaigrette dressing, and fried plantains. Heavenly! Rich flavors in the beef and pork that blend nicely. The chicken was not as rich but still yummy. The meat was so tender that i just needed to use my fork to cut into it. I stuffed myself! A great price for the amount of food you get.  Free soda refills and the staff was very nice. I left thoroughly stuffed and happy.",

Being from Miami, growing up eating at all of the local Cuban restaurants on S.W. 8th Street as well as other well known Cuban Restaurants in and around South Florida, \"hands down\" the Cuba Cafe offers the very best Cuban food in all of Las Vegas.  I am amazed at how consistently good the food is . . . It always comes out hot and fresh and the staff is always pleased to serve.

Good cuban food that you won't find anywhere else in town.  For real.    We were able to use an Entertainment Book coupon and get one meal free, SCORE!  For as many times as I have eaten here without a coupon, it felt very well deserved.    I seem to always gravitate to the Pan Con Bistec - a steak sandwich on cuban bread with shoestring potato chips on the sandwich!   I ordered a side of black beans, why not??  Where else would you get the best black beans but in a Cuban restaurant!    They serve complimentary hot cuban bread that is delish!    All in all, I've never had a subpar experience at Cuba Cafe - and I estimate I've eaten here about 15 times over the past 5 years.",

In the past I have not had a lot of experience with Cuban food save for the couple times I have been to Havana Grill (which is in Henderson). The couple times I had had it I really enjoyed it, and was hoping Cuba Cafe would produce some of those same feelings.   Let's start with the fact that the place could use a serious face lift. When we walked in I thought we had entered an Elks Lodge dining area. Have any of you out there been in an Elks Lodge with a dining area and a bar? Do you KNOW what I'm talking about? Anyway, besides the Elks Lodge feel it is also very PURPLE... purple walls, purple table clothes, purple curtains... man, I haven't seen that much purple in a long time. So the ambiance is less than appealing. How about service?  There were two people manning the floor - what appeared to be the waitress/hostess and a busser. However, the busser handled the majority of the tables. He brought our drinks, refilled our drinks, brought our food, asked us how everything was, cleared our plates. The only thing he did not do was to take our order and deliver the check. I couldn't decide who our actual server was, but the girl waitress/hostess wasn't very congenial, except for when I asked for our fried plantains to be brought out before the other food...  Speaking of food. We ordered the fried plantains as our appetizer. My husband described them as \"Tasting like an onion ring on the outside and not-ripe-enough banana on the inside\". He was right. The plantains were not what I was hoping for. As for main dishes I got the bistec sandwich, which is a piece of flat steak pressed with tomato, lettuce, and little potatolings that are fried with a sauce of sorts. This was a pretty good sandwich, but I wish the steak had not been as chewy/sinewy as it was. My husband, who wasn't into the whole \"Cuban food\" idea ordered the chicken sandwich, which was basically exactly like my bistec.  Our other side was french fries and they are nice a fat, crispy, none of them were soggy, actually quite enjoyable.  Overall with the purple dining experience and the not-so-amazing food I have to go with 3 stars. The place isn't bad and maybe I should have ordered something else, perhaps the \"ropa\" meat dish everyone exclaims about, but I wasn't hungry enough for a full plate. This place is so close to home I am not going to say I won't be back, but I don't think it was good enough to have me running back for seconds right away.",

So finally yesterday afternoon after picking him up from the airport his we saw it... like a beacon in the night! CUBA CAFE! He was soooo excited. Finally! he was getting to eat at the place he'd wanted to eat @ for SO Long!  We walked in, very small - feels like you're in someone's living room its that small. Purple, pink, blue and green walls. about 4 tables - pretty much slow looking. Perfect. He ordered some kinda Cuban Pasta dish. I ordered the classic cuban sandwich since I was pretty hungry I didn't want to order anything that was too complicated or took too long to cook. It was about 820 pm.   JUST BREAD AND WATER: We got our water, free circle cuban bread - pretty good but I didnt want to fill up on bread b/c my sandwich had bread and i\"m trying not to eat carbs for dinner.. only for brkfast or lunch.  So we wait and we wait. and WAIT. and wait some more.   OTHER TABLES: A couple comes in. They sit. They order, they drink. they eat. They finish and they leave. Sitting right next to us mind you. . The 2nd couple comes in - they sit, they order, they're eating... Then the 3rd guy.  a lone ranger guy comes in and orders an appetizer but doesnt eat it.. They i see a plate coming out thinking ooh its finally us.. nope it goes to appetizer guy who has a full plate of appetizer and ISNT EATING IT.. get's a 2ND PLATE!!!  then it happened... THE CAMEL. THE STRAW.  IT BROKE.   My Bf and I shot up simutaneously. That was it. That finally did it. ARe you FREAKING KIDDING ME??  3 tables that walked in AFTER US were already eating. and it wasnt like we got there at the same time. Lone ranger guy walked in a good 25 min. after we got there. after 45 we had flipped a coin to decide if we stayed or left. Eventhough \"leaving\" won the coin toss I decided I was hungry and we'd already waited this long, I felt bad that the food was in preperation, how do you leave? Do we just ask how long? Do we politely tell them to withdraw the order? Do we just bail? What's the protocol? I'd never waited that long in such an empty restaurant.   But the second lone ranger got his appetizer and his dinner and the couple that walked in 15 min. after us had come, eaten and left 10 min. ago.. and yet another couple was already eating their dinner too.. was just oo much to bear. We asked our spanish only speaking server what did we owe her for the bread and water - she asked if we didn want our order?   my bf told her in spanish (beware if you dont speak spanish...this could pose a problem during ordering as it did for me) we've already waited for an hour for our food. She said well pasta takes a long time - really? at my house the box says 10-11 minutes once the water is boiling. and even LESS if the pasta is fresh made which I doubt is the case. Over an hr and change for pasta and a sandwich (your most popular dish on the menu) POR FAVOR.   Never again Cuba Cafe.. next time I want Cuban I'm going to try some place else.   We drove down the street to Sushi Twister. sat ordered, ate and left all totalling a whopping 45 minutes. chickn teriyaki, salad, miso soup, salad, 8 pc california roll and 2 shrimp tempura - all in less than 45 min. Now that's good food and great service! see my review of them ! :)",

    "text": "Mmmm Meat. I've only been to Cuba Cafe for lunch, but it's a pretty great lunch place. I am still trying to get my south florida native husband to come with me and offer a final verdict (I'll update the review when I do), but for my midwestern money, this is pretty darn tasty cuban.  If you can't decide between ropa vieja and lechon asado, you can get both with the tasting plate. The buttery bread that comes free is sort of ridiculously delicious for just bread and butter. I don't even know what they do to it.   The plantains, both sweet and savory are wonderful; I've gotten soggy tostones at other cuban places not in florida, and these are crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and come with a garlic oil that's meant for slatherin'.  Pros; - Very tasty food, very friendly staff that will translate and recommend for your incredibly white co-workers without embarrassing anyone.   - Prices are pretty affordable for the amount and quality of food; it's a ton of protein and greens, so it's definitely not fast food pricing.  - Never feel sick after eating here, even if I eat way too much. It's also possible to find Low Carb options if you can resist the bread and plantains. Good luck with that? - Easy parking in a location easy for locals.  Cons: - At least at lunch time, the restaurant is a little on the dark side. It can be a little hard to see your food.",

Sandwich was great, as you'd expect. The roast pork was super tender and exceptionally tasty.   I will go back",

For dinner I selected the Tasting Plate (see photo) which contained three proteins ropa vieja (shredded beef), lechon asado (tender pork), pollo tequila (chicken breast).  It was served with yellow rice (my selection), a Cuban side salad, and wait for it...maduros (sweet plantains).  What meal would be complete without a double serving of Cuban bread?  Let's just say it was a completely delicious meal with excellent service and engaging conversation with two Cuba Cafe employees.  BTW - the Pinball Hall of Fame Museum is located minutes away!",

    "text": "I honestly do not understand how this restaurant has FOUR stars. Full disclosure: I am Cuban, born on the island, raised on *authentic* Cuban cuisine. I was in this restaurant at the beginning of August, 2019 (w/my daughter, Son-in-Law & toddler granddaughter). Let me begin with what we started off as appetizers: Croquetas & Yuca Frita. The Croquetas arrived in a round, somewhat flattened shape which, if you are Cuban, looks as if it's a \"cow patty\" (if you catch my drift) & is absolutely NOT the shape of Cuban croquetas! At. All. Then, to find out that what our Server/Hostess MEANT when she said we'd \"get ham and beef\" was that the ham and beef is a MIXTURE of both and that's what makes the croquetas. Not that we'd get both ham AND beef croquetas. The flavor was SO AWFUL that one bite was all I could swallow. Until my daughter convinced me to have another bite to make sure. I know my tastebuds and I KNOW my Cuban roots. This flavor was absolutely not what Cuban croquetas should taste like. I could not swallow a 2nd bite. The Yuca Frita was fried perfectly & my mouth watered at its sight. And then I tasted it. SO bad. It was so very BLAND, at best. My entree was a \"tapas\" of MASITAS FRITAS CON YUCA (fried pork tenderloin \"bites\" -or, pieces- w/casava -boiled per the Cuban norm). It arrived before everyone else's entree. The meat was tough, flavorless, uneventful; and the Yuca (what was supposed to be flavored with garlic, salt & lime) was extremely & extraordinarily BLAND. Also, tough. It is not supposed to be any of the aforementioned descriptions. It is supposed to be flavorful and soft enough to where I can cut w/a fork. My Son-in-Law got the Bistec and my daughter shared her PICADILLO w/her toddler, who's favorite Cuban dish is just that! I had a taste of the steak. Flavor=OFF. Toughness = so-so (should've been a bit more tender!); Done-ness = OFF (Cuban steak is supposed to be thin, flavorful & well done, NO pink! This steak wasn't any of those things). Their Cuban black beans had a super-smoky flavored that was to the extreme and so NOT Cuban! My daughter said the Picadillo was good and I took her word for it because by that time, my tastebuds AND my stomach had had enough. Enough disappointment AND enough gross tastes. I don't think I've ever had worse \"Cuban\" food in all of my 53 years. The ambiance inside was \"cheesy\" & really there was no Cuban \"feel\" to the place, whatsoever. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone I liked. Not in the least. I gave this restaurant TWO STARS because the Server was nice. That is it.",

I had the Media Noche and it is pretty much a Cuban sandwich on a sweeter egg bread. Both were beyond fantastic. Very authentic Cuban food. I also had the Moros y Christianos which is black beans and rice with peppers, garlic, bacon and onions. It was right on time!! Just like my friend Victor's momma used to make. The food was AMAZING and the staff were great. Obviously family owned and authentic down to the Cuban breads and spices. We can't wait to come back for the house specialty Cordero a Las Brasis which is rack of lamb, one of my husband's favorite meals. Make sure you visit, because it is worth it!",

    "text": "Nine of us made it here for dinner last night and I found it very Authentic.  This is a really cool cafe and what seems to be a family owned and operated restaurant. The inside is very cozy and decorated with interesting Cuban style artwork. When I called them, they mentioned to make reservations if you have more then 5 people.  Their happy hour is from Monday to Friday, buy one get one drinks from 5pm to 8pm and live music and dancing from 9pm.  The menu is loaded with a good variety of choices. It was tough to choose what I wanted and I asked the server what is popular. He said the Tasting Plate and The rack of Lamb. They bring out a basket of bread, buttered and toasty.  I got the tasting plate, because I think it would be a good idea and I was very pleased. It was priced at $16.95 and was one of the more expensive items on the menu, but you get an abundance of traditional favorites. It has Beef ( Ropa vieja), Pork (Puerco asado) and Chicken ( Pollo Grand Marnier) and comes with rice and beans, sweet plantains, and a lettuce salad. My fave was the beef and the rice.  The wonderful and unique flavors of all the dishes are hard to describe and definitely something you will have to try. The service was very friendly but was slow. We waited a while for the food and the check.  Overall, Simplemente Delicioso!",

And to be honest, I've passed this place many times without giving it a second thought.   Then, the other day, wifey and I went there for lunch.     The place was mostly empty, but it was an unusual hour.   We grabbed a table and got started with some espresso and water.   The espresso was very well done, I don't like sugar in mine, and this was strong and flavorful.     We decided on what we were going to have.  Wifey had a sampler platter and I got the Cuban sandwich.   Both were really good.  The pork was both tender and flavorful.  My sandwich was very good and the bread was top notch.   She had plantain chip with her sample platter which was really good.     Overall, this is a great place if you are craving something Cuban.   Good job folks, will I be back?  You bet.",

    "text": "Cuban food is not one of the cuisines I crave, but friends have clued me in that Cuba Cafe is the top spot in town for legit eats. I was warned not to go for the Cuban sandwich though, because that's pretty standard anywhere- come here for more adventurous dishes.  The sampler plate is a good option, with four different meats to figure out which you like. The spicy stewed pork dish was my favorite, but the shredded beef was good too. A thick sliced pork was on the dry side. And I've never really been into maduros. Solid intro option. But really keep an eye on the specials- came in and found Pork Bruschetta one day and it was flipping fantastic. Two skewers of grilled pork with veggies, like a cuban take on kabobs, over a flavorful rice with a tomato-based sauce. Everything was full of flavor and the meat had a great smokey taste to it. Bonus points for siding this with a light salad with crunchy cabbage and a slightly sweet dressing, which really complemented the heavier main dish. Wish this was on the regular menu!  Cuba Cafe is a great leisurely lunch option. An evening visit will treat you to live music and dancing, but I prefer to converse. Full bar available.",

It's a seasoned shredded beef, great as a sandwich or on the fresh Cuban style bread. The yuca al mojo is a must have. The yuca has the texture of a potato, and its covered with a buttery garlic sauce.  If you like garlic, you must try this. The black beans and rice are so tasty. They have pieces of pork fat in there which takes it to another level. The service here is always friendly, which makes you want to come back for more. ONE OF THE BEST RESTAURANTS IN LAS VEGAS!",

Nevertheless..if you want Cuban with the \"real deal\" cuban flavors..try maybe El Rincon Crillollo..and not the best either..their portions are very small. Cuban food is not served in small portions...just trying to save money...?  This place is not gonna make it here unless you get with the program!  Make some \"Arroz con Pollo a la Chorrera\" or something people!  Some real cuban empanadas not the Argentinean ones...though good..but not even made with the right cuban masa!  \"If\" and I do mean \"if\"...the cook, or the owner is Cuban?   Serve up some real Cuban classic dishes..dont be ashamed..real Cuban food..theres nothing like it.....",

This is my second time visiting Vegas, we come from Tampa FL and we eat cuban food all the time and I was ready to try different stuff but after eating sushi the night before, my husband was ready for \"real food\" so we went here and we were very disappointed...   The place is nice, location not too bad and not having to worry about where to park was good but i am 99.9% sure that the cook is not cuban.  If you don't really know the difference between a good cuban dish and a not so good I guess you'll be pleased, but if you do then I suggest you go else where  PS: stay away from the Tamales Criollos... Not good at all!  All you can taste is the seasoning instead of the corn.",

The chicken soup with the squeeze of lime was oh so tasty. The Empanada was hot and fresh and flaky crusted and had a wonderful filling. The Cuban Sandwich was Swiss cheesy  wonderful and the pork was perfection (are you getting the idea I liked this place?).  Go and enjoy, I know I will be coming back!

    "text": "We interacted with Cuba Cafe, as they were moving to their larger, current location.  I visited their soon to be new location and purchased a few pieces of restaurant equipment.  A young Mexican couple, *name redacted*, were working for the owner of Cuba Cafe and the Landlord, and Owners of Sergio's Italian Restaurant, Across the street, Mr. Napoli and his Daughter.  The restaurant was absolutely filthy.  There were roaches and grease everywhere.  The couple were on their hands and knees cleaning and scraping, with grease and rotten food covering their bodies and faces.            They told me that they are homeless and that they have lived and will live in the restaurant, until they finish cleaning it up and repainting it.  They explained to me that Cuba Cafe had not paid them for any of the work.  After complaining to the Landlord they were told, by the Landlord, in my presence, that he would pay them with the old broken greasy equipment that they were able to clean up, regardless of what Cuba Cafe does.  Basically, they can keep the equipment fix it and sell it.  I decided that I would help them move and clean up the equipment, outside of the restaurant.  I was well aware that they could not sell the equipment, in this condition, and that it would take a few months to be sold.             We rented a large u - haul truck.  We were in the processes of moving the equipment onto the truck when the owner of Cuba Cafe, *name redacted*, brought over the Landlord and told the couple that he made a new deal with the Landlord for some of the equipment, *the desirable pieces that worked*, and that they were evicted immediately, for continuing to complain about getting paid, that if they don't leave the property the police will be called.              They were not paid, and were once again homeless.  I let them borrow the u haul until they could find a place to store the few pieces of damaged nasty equipment that they were allowed to keep.  After 2 days, they could not find a place to store the equipment and were living in the u haul.  I ended up storing the equipment for them for a year.  They were given a key to the storage unit.  They never came back and I don't know what happened to the married couple.  I have not spoken with them since.              You can't hire people, without pay!  That is slavery.  I don't care if they were drug addicts, criminals, or etc.  I'm sitting here tearing up thinking about what they did to these good people.  If you have money, pay the poor what they deserve.  These people did a very good job cleaning up his restaurant.  If you've been there, just remember who cleaned it up.  They did an amazing job.  They should have been paid, not thrown out.",

The bread that they bring out to you first....uuummmm......we also like the ropa vieja, the yuca, the steak... on the money! Its not bad in price.  The place also has live music on some nights. Call them if you are interested on knowing what nights, 702-795-7070 or check out their website <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcubancafelv.com&s=228d67bbc4b38f244f03701fa596f6571d79c8c9d67f678d5d8b0aa6094673f6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cubancafelv.com</a>. I haven't been there on live music night.  The place is not huge but does have a bar.  I think the food at this place is better than the Florida cafe.  My opinion. I'm use to food in New York City, so I know real Caribbean food.  And if you know Vegas there aren't too many real good tasting Caribbean food spots.  Well you just found one! Buen Provecho!",

When the Ropa Vieja simmering in a mouthwatering sauce, cooked to perfection, melts in your mouth, you will dance.  Outstanding flavors in the Moros Cristianos... Maduros?  These Caramelized Plantains will drive you crazy!    Lechon Asado, I don't even want to tell you want you might do after tasting this.  Delicious, Delicious, Delicious!  I had the Tasting Platter, and a side of tostones.  The food was outstanding, and the service couldn't have been better.  So far, this is by far one of my all time favorite restaurants.  Thank you.",

I love everything and that's why I keep coming back! From the ambiance/vibe, to the live music, but most importantly the food and the mojitos! Hands down one of the best Cuban meals you will ever have!   My favorite dish is the lamb chops (cordero a las brasas). They are cooked to perfection. This dish is phenomenal!  As far as desserts go, I recommend the \"Maria Luisa,\" which is a combination flan, tres leches cake & ice cream. That first bite I take, I feel like I died and go to heaven.   The service is just as amazing as the food, and nothing short of perfection. Our server, Braunni, is gregarious and knowledgeable. He truly makes the experience one of a kind! The way he describes each item on the menu, it is hard not to want to order every single thing on the menu!  Absolutely amazing, humble, prompt, & friendly service from him. And if you ever crave a Mojito, come here, he is also the bartender and makes the best ones in town! I highly recommend!!!     Cuba Cafe you seriously hit it straight out of the ballpark. Staff is attentive and anticipates our every need. From the moment you step into the restaurant, you can tell that everyone cares tremendously about the restaurant and the experience. The best service, experience, food and mojitos ever!!!",

    "text": "I have been visiting Cuba Cafe since 2015 and it's time for an updated review.   The Place: Cute restaurant off the strip on Tropicana Ave. The place is medium size. They have a bar and restaurant area. Dimmed lighting, clean, pink napkins and black table cloths. Habana pictures hanging on the walls. Bar area with seating and room for a \"salsa band.\"    The Food:  Cuban food and small tapas in their menu. Authentic food? Not sure. I have never been to Cuba. However, I am from South America and can recognize comfort and effortless food.   The restaurant serves sliced bread, warmed with butter; this is the same bread they use for their Cubano Sandwiches. It's simple, but it feels good.  As an appetizer, I like to get \"Empanadas.\" At Cuba Cafe, you can find delicious Chorizo and Beef empanadas, very flavorful! Yummy. They used to bring chimichurri in a sauce container, and now they just put a little chimichurri in the plate. So now you don't have enough chimichurri for the empanadas.     I've had several of their dishes, but I am just going to focus on my last visit. I had the \"Churrasco Cubano\"-Skirt steak, chimichurri, white rice, black beans, maduros (fried sweet plantains) and salad. The steak was really juicy and had a wonderful flavor. I loved it!  My husband had his \"Media Noche\" cuban sandwich- pork, ham, pickles, cheese, and mustard. Delicious and just the right amount of mustard.   For dessert, I used to love the \"Tres Leches\" served here, but during my last visit, they made it less juicy and did not put extra condensed milk. I am taking out a whole star because of this! They went from the best Tres leches to just OK. :::( Sniff, sniff, sniff.    We always get a mojito to go with food. Let me tell you Cuba Cafe have one of the greatest Mojitos I have ever had. Nothing fancy, just the basics but whatever they do, they know how to make them. Cheers!!   The Service: Service has always been great. During my last visit, I felt it took longer than average. Food took longer, and mojitos took longer. They used to have 2 girls and now there is only one girl plus kitchen staff. I think they are understaffed at the moment.   Overall 4 stars. Still one of my favorite places to go but not a 5 Stars anymore. Yes, I will continue to come back and hope my Tres Leches goes back to normal. #BringOldTresLechesBack",

We ordered a small plate of grilled lamb chops. These were exceptionally cooked, medium well done. I ordered the oxtail plate. They were tendered and not greasy. So tendered no knife needed. The plate had a cup of white rice and a small salad - cup of black beans on the side. I can't believe I ate the whole thing. We had ordered a bottle of Chilean wine, but, it was not of our tasting and the owner changed it to an Italian Pinot Grigio for the same price. We had a MARIA Luisa Desert and a cortadito to finish our beautiful dinner. Cosa Mas Grande La Vida, Chico! Our bill  $69.00 plus tip. Thank you Yelp for the find!",

I was not in the mood for any shenanigans or bad food on this particular outing.    I found the food just okay.  My husband and son loved the empanadas.  I had the lechon plate.  Some of the more burnt pieces of meat had good flavor.  I found the rest somewhat bland.  I was very excited about eating some Tostones.  For some reason it took them an excessively long time to make them.  I reminded them three times and they said they are made fresh.  I understand that.  I really can't see how you could make them ahead of time.  I've made Tostones at home.  Anyway, I think they forgot.  There wasn't any salt on them but the garlic sauce was tasty.",

Upon arrival you will see they have a stage for live music in the evening on the right side of he restaurant and plenty of tables and booths to the left. They also have a bar area near the stage. The decor is Cuban and boosts some artwork and cool fans.   The servers are nice and helpful with any of your needs. They are happy to explain menu items and give suggestions. They bring a nice basket of fresh hot garlic toast to each table that seems to disappear before you know it! Wonder if it's bottomless ;-). The menu includes plenty of tapas, sandwiches, sides, specialties and some interesting desserts.  My colleagues tried the sample platter and ordered extra items like tamales, black bean rice, plantains, beef empanada, croquetas, mariquitas and papa rellena 4/5. Very filling and good variety.  I ordered the sandwich Cubano which is a roasted pork, ham, cheese, mustard and pickle hot pressed on Cuban bread. Delicious to the last bite! 4/5  Tip: they offer 5% Yelp cash back!",

Their sampler entree with roasted pork, ropa vieja and grilled chicken is great too. You get a little bit of everything Cuban food has to offer in one dish. The rice and beans and salad are so good.

As you step inside you get a very authentic feeling. We were seated immediately and ordered a pitcher (we were thirsty) of white sangria which was delicious. We then ordered some appetizers which included a chicken empanada, I was pleasantly surprised. Next time I could make a meal out of them. Lightly fried, not at all greasy and the chicken was juicy and tender. The Cuban sandwich was definitely the star of the meal. I haven't had many of these sandwiches, but might just stop here as it was very good. Our overall dining experience was wonderful. I felt like I was in a restaurant that was owned by a family who invited us in for supper. We look forward to coming back",

    "text": "What a nice surprise to stumble upon this place after dropping someone off at the Italian restaurant next door. We took a chance on alluring Cuban tapas & food and very happy we did. Greeted with Latin beats and a friendly staff is the best way to come in out of the cold. We were immediately tempted with their BOGO Happy Hour mojitos...coconut, pineapple flavors. Being \"lightweights\", we asked them to take it easy on the alcohol--well, I don't think the bartender's heavy pour hand got the message since we both felt a slight buzz after only a couple sips :) Warm buttered bread was very much a needed alcohol buffer. The menu offered many appealing choices from tapas like empanadas, tostones, to chicken, beef and seafood entrees. The one item we were looking for wasn't listed on the menu. It was a favorite entree offered at Havana Grill...the pollo ala plancha. But, ASK and you shall receive!  Our server said they did offer it and 2 orders later we enjoyed our favorite marinated thin chicken breast topped with sauteed onions, served with a medley side salad that was the perfect addition to complete this healthy & delicious meal. Rice and black beans of course. To top it off, they even had my favorite habanero sauces. Value is good and food is wonderful. Havana who? Cuba Cafe is our top pick for Cuban in Vegas.",

Great quality food, definitely had a \"made from scratch\" feeling. Everything tasted really fresh and if we'd made it ourselves. My only critique would be : More Flavor. This was the mildest flavored Latin food I've ever tasted. Where's the big bold garlic kick? I really missed it. We will be back for the friendly, attentive service and great quality food and value ( portions are huge ).   Bonus: The live entertainment duo were phenomenal !",

I went with the tasting plate that included ropa vieja, lechon asada, and polla tequila plus morros & Christianos and maduros.  Portions are large so neither of us could even think about dessert this evening.  Prior to exiting I told the owner to compliment the chef because the food was much improved over our last visit.",

We liked it so much we came 2x on our vacation. Friday nights they have live Spanish music. Great Latin Ambiance. The Churrasco was great and so was the bistec empanizado.

I think they have new management because the last time we went there their menu is different (more options - which is good) and the decor and overall ambiance was nicer. Ordered white rice with red beans and bistec de palomilla (with onions) and it was good, their fried plantains are very good too. This time my daughter ordered their pollo guisado/fricase and I don't know what happened but it tasted like burned (ahumado, como que se quemo en la olla y como quiera lo sirvieron) so I don't think we'll be ordering this dish anymore (it is a shame because we like this dish very much and in other occasions it was delicious). My husband had milanesa and it was very good too. I'm still giving them 4 stars and not 5 because of the incident with the pollo guisado/fricase. Please don't serve food if you know it doesn't taste good (it was obviously burned).",

    "text": "This is a long standing love of mine.  It's a Cuban restaurant that is a cross of authentic food with an upscale presentation and higher standard of service.  Yet without a higher price tag.  Imagine if Nana had taken a culinary class.  It's in a 3 star neighborhood with 4 star food.  There are mainstays like toasted Cuban pork or beef sandwiches.  Plantains, bruschetta, croquetas and the lot are all there.  The other tapa sized dishes include 2 lamb chops that are so savory, shrimp and Mahi ceviche and a masitas fritas pork medalion with a nice texture to it as well.  As far as the mains you can't go wrong with the Lechon Asado, easily my favorite main.  So tender and dripping with some kind of delicious sauce with rice black beans and that really fresh tasty salad.  Mix all these in each bite and it may become a favorite for you too.  The Camarones Al  Ajillo is a Cuban twist on scampi lemon buttery sauced GIGANTIC shrimp with black beans and rice.  Better than any description I could ever attempt to give.  Not too fond of the Ropa Vieja.  A shredded beef and sautee'd peppers and onions.  It must be an authentic dish.  It's not bad I may just be spoiled by the other courses.   You can't go wrong with an espresso and a Leche Flan or Tiramisu for dessert afterwards.  You wont break the bank here and you will be satisfied.  I still taste the savory and decadently rich sweetness of the meals here.",

The staff is attentive and friendly. The food is awesome. If you are a first timer, order the tasting plate. You get to try 3 of their main dishes on smaller scale. You will not regret coming to cuba cafe!",

The interior is decorated nicely inside and noticed several patrons were speaking Cuban.   My waitress was super friendly and she brought me hot butter toasted bread that was soo good.  I ordered the Lechon asado which is marinated roasted leg of pork topped with fresh garlic, olive oil, lime mojo and served with Moros & Cristianos. The pork was so tender I could cut if with my fork and salad and rice was also delicious too!  The portion was large see my pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jmyvOW6G2T1fIePvajB4nQ?select=2xIXjVjc0ZcxnnPpbblyNA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jmyv...</a>:   My food arrived quickly and the place is very clean. Water here is filtered which is a  plus by my standards.",

We got there about 6pm, and by the time we left (maybe 7pm?) it was starting to fill up. There was a special that we later were told was most nights the same. It was a small filet, rice and beans, and the steak was in a pepper sherry sauce. My two friends both got this. I got the Lechon Asado (pork) with yellow rice. It was to come with beans and rice but they let me substitute the yellow rice. Also served to the table was a kind of warm, puffy bread. Crisp on the outside, and soft and wonderful inside. My pork was tremendous. Couldn't ask for more. I'd recommend NOT getting a side salad (extra cost). We didn't and I'm glad as I was full afterwards. I did try my friends steaks. Wow! Melt in your mouth nice! I highly recommend both meals. I'm not sure how cuban the steak is, but it was superb. The steal meal was $15.49 I believe. My pork dish was $15.95. I'll tell you what. I'll definitely be back and recommend that people try this place. Service was a bit slow, especially since it was not crowded, but worth it. Again, it was nice inside. I'd NOT recommend shorts or t-shirt. But jeans and a button up shirt is perfect.",

He loved it. I had the steak sandwich. It was tasty but didn't feel \"special\" next time I will get a regular Cuban dinner.  Very friendly service. The bread was excellent - a little too good I certainly overloaded on carbs!  Nice atmosphere clean restaurant.  Update: I have now eaten a variety of the regular Cuban Dinners and they are fantastic.  The empanada appetizer is also mighty tasty.  The tasting plate dinner has a nice variety of ropa vieja, pork, and tequila chicken if you are not sure what to order.",

When I'm craving some good ole Criollo eatin' and my mom's not in town, I know that Cuba Cafe will fulfill my craving and leave me fat and happy and full. There are a few Cuban restaurants in Las Vegas but this one is by far the best. It's small, homey, nothing fancy, but the servers are super nice and attentive and the food is fresh and flavorful and plentiful. It's a bit slow to come out of the kitchen, but you can't rush greatness. The wait is definitely worth it, especially with a basket of warm, crusty bread and a delicious mojito. I recommend their arroz con pollo with a side of red beans and tostones. For a light lunch their Cubano sandwich is excellent. Anyone who doesn't like this place doesn't know what good Criollo food is.",

The food has a home cooked feel.        - Quality - Of the couple things I've tried, I couldn't say a bad thing about any of them. The meat was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection.        - Area - The area is not the greatest. It's in a shadier part of town, but the food is well worth the risk.        - Buttered Toasted Bread - They bring you this bread before your meal. It's crazy good and definitely terrible for you (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jmyvOW6G2T1fIePvajB4nQ?select=qfjltfAcu4Cqwqk6nQi2xg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jmyv...</a>). **Ordered**        - $11.95 Lechon Asado - Leg of pork. It comes with moros (rice/black beans) and their salad. This is my favorite dish (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jmyvOW6G2T1fIePvajB4nQ?select=1cWPUf5Xc2SiGblokqdwIg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jmyv...</a>).        - $13.95 Ropa Vieja - Shredded marinated beef. It also comes with moros and their salad. Personally, I find the marinate to be too strong, but I prefer a bit more bland than others.        - $14.95 Tasting Plate - Comes with Ropa Vieja, Lechon Asado, and Pollo Tequila with moros, salad, and plantains. If you're unsure what to order, this would be the thing to get. It has their most popular choices all in one plate (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jmyvOW6G2T1fIePvajB4nQ?select=yTPnf0qnrCcXZqoCZQBfAQ#yTPnf0qnrCcXZqoCZQBfAQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jmyv...</a>). **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a delicious Cuban restaurant.

After about 45 seconds a guy came from the back to seat us.  We checked yelp for pictures of some of the things that looked interesting...  My wife settled on the pollo al ajillo. It was chicken with a mushroom sauce. It had great flavor with a hint of a lemon taste. Excellent dish.  I ordered the arroz con camarones...OMG this dish was soooo good. Every single bite had me excited about the next. I felt like I was eating at someone's house and they whipped together a great homecooked Cuban dish. You usually don't get food like this at a restaurant. The shrimp tasted fresh...the only negative was that I wish they had taken the tails off but I'm not complaining. We are on our last day here in Vegas but we are going back today before we leave. The food and the service was great. Our server was very attentive and accommodating.

I don't think I saw the girl with the long braid (our server) or he back waiter (tall guy with beard) smile once. But they definitely seemed to like the other people who came in. Chatting away. Ok I get it. We obviously stick out like a sore thumb. We asked questions about the food. Because my boyfriend has food allergies and we don't speak or read Spanish. Honestly if we had been made to feel more at home then I would have given this place 5 stars because the food was delicious!   We ordered pineapple mojito, coconut mojito (had no coconut flavor), we had the sampler for an app. So good a little of everything. Not big. Not enough to split with more than 2 people. Then I had the taste for an entree and he had some shredded beef plate. The black bean rice is good.  I wish I could tell you what everything was named but I forgot.   Management should work on along people of all walks of life feel welcomed and at home.  That would have made a huge difference.",

    "text": "Finally  a Cuban restaurant  that does it right!! I grew up eating Cuban food so I pretty much know what to expect.   We came in for lunch,  the place was busy which was a good sign.  I ordered  an appetizer - croquettas made of ham and beef.  They were delicious  and full of flavor. One of the better ones I've had in a restaurant.  For my meal I got the Lechon Asado, which is roasted pork shoulder.  The meal comes with black beans cook in the rice and a small salad.  I  also ordered a side of plantains.  The serving of pork was generous.  The pork was marinated with a garlic mojo and flavorful.  The meat was very tender and moist.  The rice and beans were excellent.   My friend  ordered the bistec empanizado which is a breaded thin steak it too came with rice and beans and a small salad.  I tried the steak, it had great  flavor but was a tad dry.  Still very good.   They will bring you bread for free.  The bread was very good.  All and all the service was good,  meals came right up.  Friendly staff and a good variety on the menu.  Prices were very reasonable.   I will be eating there on my next visit to the area.  Can't wait to try some of the other items.  The Cuban sandwich  and media  noche looked delicious  as they passed by my table.  Highly recommend  this restaurant.",

The arroz con gandules was ok.  Didn't realize it had pork or meat in it otherwise I would not have ordered.  Was a little cakey in consistency but perhaps it was because it was delivered.  Also ordered the plantain flambe dessert which was delicious.  Only drawback is that you get a lot more ice cream than actual sweet plantains so for the price I'm not sure if you actually get your money's worth.

Larger in size than one might guess, the low ceilings, dim lighting, and live music with a rose at each table providing a romantic sort of feel, it was a bit too close to the crooners that we were first seated and despite being at only 1/3 capacity it was not until one of several dirty tables was bussed that a move was accommodated, a large order soon to follow with minimal delay from the kitchen as conversation ensued and beverage refills were repeatedly offered.  Starting off with buttered bread that wasn't especially appealing or particularly \"Cuban\" in any way, it was not long before a duo of \"appetizers\" arrived to render the basket irrelevant, a sampler of four items including plantain chips highlighted by creamy croquetas while the empanada trended a bit greasy, a pressed Cuban Sandwich not quite as crispy as those found in Miami though the meat to cheese ratio and light application of mustard and pickle was on point.  Insisting that a Cuban friend said the Camarones Enchilados was good, though the resulting plate was little more than some previously frozen U16 shrimp cooked a bit too firm beneath a ladle of sauce not really distinctive from that at any checkered-tablecloth spot, a far better value was found in the tasting plate of Beef, Chicken, and Pork with smashed plantains and tender beans with rice - the Ropa robustly flavored by onions and peppers without being overwhelmed while the Lechon was a bit too fatty to be enjoyed in its entirety, the chicken trending a touch sweet but certainly not bad by any means.  Doing the heavy lifting on most of the food, it was still essential that dessert be ordered in order to evaluate the experience as a whole, and thankfully finding a willing partner to tackle the restaurant's two \"de la casa\" signatures, the combination of flan and tres leches an excellent rendition of each with light notes of pineapple while a 'flambe' of strawberries was tasty enough, but also a bit disappointing as I'd half-expected a fiery tableside show.  ***Competently executing some Cuban Classics while also offering several options for those not entirely interested in going all-in on such heavy Ethnic fare, Cuba Cafe fills a niche for those with a craving while also offering an introduction to any who are curious without breaking the bank...or boarding a plane.",

For starters, we got the shrimp ceviche, tapas tasting plate: 2 empanadas (chicken and beef), croquetas and mariquitas/plantain chips.  The empanadas were good and had good flavor but the crust was a tad bit thick.  The croquetas had a strong ham taste to them which was good.  The shrimp ceviche also came with plantain chips cut differently.  The plantain chips were...well, plantain chips.  For our entree, we got the tasting plate: pollo tequila, lechon asado, ropa vieja with Moros Cristianos, maduros/sweet plantains, and beans and rice.  I liked the lechon asado, ropa vieja and maduros.  The lechon was tender and juicy but I wish it had crispy skin to it.  The ropa vieja was tender and didn't lack flavor unlike the pollo tequila.  The maduros were great - sweet and was not undercooked.   The service was not so good.  The server took our order and gave us our basket of bread and forgot about us.  She didn't check on us.  She had her shock face on when she passed by our table 20-30 minutes later and still with no food on our table.",

We showed up about an hour after they opened and the service was a little slow. A few tables were filled but there were still many open tables in the restaurant. As people began to build up at the front door, we were all seated. Drink orders were taken quickly and after just the right amount of time, the waitress came to take our food order.  It took a while to get out food out, we waited longer than we would have liked to. I got the Tasting Plate which has a sampling of 3 different meats with rice. The food was amazing. Everything was tender and flavorful.  My coworker unfortunately found a hair in her salad after eating half of her dish. The waitress apologized several times and let her have her entire meal for free. We definitely did not expect that. She made up for the hair and the slow service by showing genuine empathy for the situation.  I would go back as my experience was pretty good. This just isn't a place to go for an hour lunch break.",

I can't help but feel that these reviews came from yelpers who aren't too knowledgeable on Cuban food or really appreciate it.... at the risk of sounding opinionated... this place is above mediocre and I have pretty high standards with Cuban food coming from NYC area ;).   If it's your first time trying Cuban food, I definitely recommend their tasting plate. Comes with a little bit of everything. Food is fresh, flavorful, and filling. Service was friendly and the environment felt more intimate than American restaurants.... almost like dining in a private room with your close and extended family members. The workers are very patient and helpful with whatever alterations and/or questions you may have.   If you don't want to spend $$$ on lamb, they have the appetizer portion, which was perfect to have on the side of our tasting plate. All of the meat is incredibly tender!   My friend from LA said that it was the best Cuban restaurant she's ever been to... and we will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "I wish I had paid more attention to the area around UNLV while I was attending school. The diversity of cuisines are a bit awe inspiring even though some might sound better than they really are.   Cuba Cafe is at street view, but at night does not stand out because this area is poorly lit. The restaurant is accessible through a gated patio area and the inside has less than ten tables. The quaint shop is intimate and quiet with low level Spanish music playing.   Came here with a few friends around 8:30pm and the restaurant was steady, but emptying out. We were greeted promptly with menus and our drink orders were taken. The waitress was quick to try and take our order, but we were still deciding. After some time, Jason B. ordered the pan con bistec. A thin cut beef sandwich served on grilled Cuban bread with lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, and potato strings. At $7.50, it was not a bad deal. There wasn't very much meat, but it was tender. If you are looking for a thick American style steak, this is not the sandwich for you. It was tasty and the flavors were not leaning towards any extremes. Another friend and I shared the tasting plate and an order of the yuca al mojo o frita. We were warned that the tasting plate was small and might not be enough for the two of us. If it wasn't so late, or if I was really hungry, I would understand why, but neither of us were looking for a full meal. The sampling of pork, beef, chicken, mixed rice and black beans, fried plantains, and salad was enough to satisfy. The two slices of lechon asado were tender and moist. The pollo tequila was ok, but nothing special. The ropa vieja was the stand out dish. It was flavorful without being overbearing and went well with the rice. The plantains were crispy at the edges, soft and moist on the inside, sweet, but came in three small pieces. At $14.95, if you are super hungry, it would be upsetting to see. The yuca were probably my favorite part of the whole meal. A strong garlic flavor was present in every bite while the flesh of the tuber was soft, moist, and picked up the essence of the olive oil.   Overall I found elements of each dish that I liked, but as a whole it was mediocre. I would come again because I did not get a chance to scout out the arroz con pollo.",

    "text": "Small and unassuming, nestled in a strip mall on Tropicana, one of the best home-cooked (or at least, that's how it feels) meals in Las Vegas. A friend found this place here on Yelp.That was 8 months ago. I am here so often, I am surprised I don't have a name tag.   The lamb chops alone will have me stopping there for dinner on the way home from work. Add the mariquitas con mojo and an avocado salad and I am a happy diner. I am told the bread is absolutely perfect (I can't eat it, but watch it devoured every time I take anyone with me).  Proteins are always tender and, depending on the dish, cooked to order. The salads are fresh (I might suggest a little more balsamic on the caprese and avocado salads), the flavors are deep and so complicated as to seem simple... spot on.   The latin-caribbean blend of flavors is nothing found in a spice jar and the care they put into their food is readily apparent. Sometimes the dishes can come out a little slowly... but when you bite into it, you find it's worth it. Nothing assembly line here.   FYI: The mozzarella and peppers salad is a caprese salad... sub sweet red peppers for the usual tomatoes. I tried this on Sunday and I have a new favorite way to eat a caprese. A great, flavorful twist on a simple staple.  Everyone is ready with a smile and happy to offer assistance in making choices or - sometimes unavoidable - substitutions. (Try not to, if you can, and trust this family to feed you well.) The menu is broad and will cater to almost any palette, and the specials change all the time so that they can offer you something new and tasty to keep you coming back.  Easy on the pocketbook (sign up for their email specials and find them on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>), always tasty, and friendly to boot, how could this not be a favorite?  Limited beer and wine (for those cocktailers out there)... though I would LOVE to see them broaden that and start offering a mojito or three. ;)",

I miss grandmas cooking and the menu looked close to some old familiar dishes.    Service was excellent it was a Friday night and there was dancing and the entertainment was good.  The atmosphere was lively but not obnoxious.    We ordered a few drinks and sangria all good excellent variety to choose from, we had several different dishes and the food was well prepared and i even placed an order to go so i could have tostones y juevos for breakfast....they tasted awesome the next day by the way.  Food was awesome and after dinner they presented my son a nice mini cake for his birthday.  The prices are fair for food some of the liquor choices can be pricey but excellent selection. My daughter raved about the cuba libre and another selection.  Only regret is not getting some salsa dancing in but I recommend the place for food service and sangria.  Also at home in California very difficult to find cocina criolla and it was a nice walk back down memory lane.",

I am the type of person who will drive a hundred miles for Cuban food and to prove this point I drive 270 miles to Vegas and I go to the Cuba Cafe then go to the Strip.  If I can fit more than one trip in there I do, seriously it is that good. In fact, the most tender and delicious lechon asado I have ever tasted.  The avocado salad is a must also, the avocados are always spot on perfectly ripe and they have a great mixed salad in the middle.  Every time I go in I swear I am going to try something different but then the pork seductively calls my name and I stay with it.    Located only 10 minutes from the Strip and just East of the airport off Tropicana Blvd this is THE go to Cuban restaurant",

    "text": "Sorry Cuba Cafe, you let me down. After experiencing Cuban food in Miami I was ecstatic to see there was authentic Cuban food in Vegas that actually had good reviews. I was so excited to reminisce on my Cuban favorites. The place itself is VERY small. I would say 10 tables max. When we walked in, there was a table of 7 or 8 people and the empty tables were all missing chairs due to the shortage. Apparently this place isn't used to large parties. Thankfully there were 3 chairs left to make us a table.   Their menu isn't HUGE but has most of the Cuban staples. Ropa Vieja was a must for me. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I even make it myself, however today was a day I would like to spend away from the kitchen.  We ordered the avocado salad and lamb chops to start. The avocado salad is basically just an avocado cut in slices and nicely arranged around a small cabbage and tomato salad. The avocados were tasty and soft but the salad in the middle lacked some flavor. I threw some salt on the avos and ate just them. The lamb chops (from what I heard) were very good. I don't eat lamb so I can't elaborate on this.  For entrees we ordered the ropa vieja (appetizer portion), a side of rice to sop up all the juicy goodness that comes with ropa (more on this later), a rack of lamb and the tasting platter, which consisted of ropa, a chicken dish and a pork dish. When the ropa came out, there was NO JUICE! :( I was disappointed to say the least. Every time I have made this or had this the beef was always swimming in that tasty juice. Because of this the ropa was pretty dry. The flavor was good but because of the lack of moisture I couldn't even eat it with the rice. The lamb chops (again from what I heard) were good. The spinach that comes with them, although good, had no real flavor. It needed some garlic or other flavoring. The tasting platter was good as well. The pork was fork tender, the chicken was spicy (just as my friend had ordered it), however she too stated the ropa was a little dry for her taste.   For dessert we ordered tres leches, flan and guava with cream cheese. The tres leches tasted like store bought pound cake that had been soaked in milk. The flan actually tasted more like tres leches than the real thing. I am not a flan fan because of its texture but this was a little stiffer and more like a cheesecake. The guava with cream cheese was swimming in a sweet sauce and not what I was used to. I am not familiar with the authentic presentation of this dish, however when I dined in little cuba in Tampa, it was always served as a slice of guava paste topped with cream cheese. This was more of a runny paste soaked in simple syrup topped with a line of cream cheese.  All in all the experience wasn't horrible, however I would not go back. They messed up on the bill and overcharged us, and then when it was corrected the total was still the same. I was not going to argue over $10 so we just ignored it. The bread they give you in very good and with a $25 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> gift certificate it was worth the try. I guess I will be searching for more Cuban restaurants in the very near future!",

The staff have Spanish/Cuban accent, dressed simply but appropriately. Food was superb, even better than a Cuban place we went to in Manhattan. Big portions. Inexpensive for what it is. We loved it.

When you enter the dining room, you'll notice two things: 1. the homey Cuban decor (notwithstanding the poster of Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights); 2. everyone is speaking Spanish. This is not a fancy restaurant, and somehow that inspires confidence as soon as you walk in. Every table gets a basket of grilled bread with butter - simple and delicious. The platanos maduros (sweet fried bananas aka plantains) were flavorful and not too oily. The lechon asado (marinated pork leg) is on the menu cover for good reason. It is famazing. The pork was very tender and succulent. That said, I can not recommend the sandwich cubano. I don't know if it's because I can't appreciate it or I've simply had better (Paseo in Seattle), but it was quite plain. I was expecting more punch especially when compared to the lechon asado. But, I think the entrees are Cuba Cafe's strength, and I will definitely be back. Service was good despite our lack of Spanish communication. Try the Cuban sodas!",

We went there for lunch and they had a lunch special, Churrasco, this was at 12:30 when we got to the restaurant, it was fairly empty, only 3 tables were occupied, the waitress takes our order and we order two lunch special, she comes back after a while and says they only have one lunch special left, i mean this is 12:30 how could be out of lunch special at this time with an empty restaurant?, so i had to settle for something else, a cuban sandwich. We also ordered a tastting plater, the empanadas were very good but that was about it and the waitress offered my husband some chimichurri sauce to go with the fried plantains and we finished the platter and the sauce was nowhere to be found. Then our food came and it was alright tasting, my husband churrasco was ok and the yuca con mojo where somewhat dry. The sandwich was good. We also ordered some mamey shake which had a very strange flavor as if they used frozen mamey to make it.  When we got the check it was wrong so they have to go fix it. Overall the food is just ok, service not so good since they took long for everything. We went to this place because we saw all the great reviews about it and i must say i was disappointed.",

The sandwich tasted homemade--like something my grandmother might have made (even though she was English, not Cuban), with tender, well-done roast pork.  The mamey shake was a little bland, but never having had mamey before, I had to try it.  I assume that's the way mamey is, and it was soothing and cooling, so the bland wasn't a total negative.  Think sort of an apricot-peach-tropical shake that is meant to be good for you, and you have an idea how it tastes.  Service was fine, but I was the only customer in the place.  I'd try this place a second time when I have a bigger appetite.",

    "text": "Well my pop wanted to take me and my other 1/2 out for dinner.  I was in the mood for something other than the usual American or Chinese, so I chose Cuban and luckily for us Cafe Cuba is right around the corner.  My pop and I have had a lot of Cuban food being from South Florida, but my other 1/2 never had it..   He got Bistec con papas in a delish gravy with white rice as did my pop.  I had wonderful pork with rice and black beans flavored with bacon. Each entree came with a really nice salad with a great dressing.  It also came with fried Cuban bread slices. My other 1/2 had 2 glasses of dark rich Cuban beer and a Cuban coffee to finish the meal.  We all wanted dessert, but had no room. Everything was seasoned perfectly and cooked perfectly as well. My other 1/2 raved to the owner and the chef about the food and sopped up the remaining sauce with a 2nd basket of bread.  Our bill was under $60 and worth every penny.  We will be back soon !!  Ceviche for me next time !",

    "text": "I've only gone here for lunch.  My favorite things are the croquette sandwich, the fried bananas, and the lemonade.  The croquette sandwich reminds me of corned beef hash (like what you would eat for breakfast) only much better.  I haven't figured out how the lemonade is different, but it's excellent.  I like the cubano sandwich also, but I prefer the croquette.",
