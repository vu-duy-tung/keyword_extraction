But equally as good are their assortment of cream cheeses and their pastries, cookies, etc.  Whenever I'm on this side of town, I like to get their bagel and lox sandwich w/ lite scallion cream cheese. I was there today and someone ordered a pastrami sandwich that looked amazing, so I may need to divert from my standard order.",

Everything was off the chart. Brought extra napkins with meal, bonus, as eating a tower of cream cheese, tomato, onion, cucumber, capers and thinly slice lox (perfect) can be messy at times. The servers and bussers were around often to refill my coffee mug. Made me feel like I was on the East Coast at a NY Deli. I put the address on my phone screen to press and get me there, as I am new to Las Vegas. Still learning to get around. I can't wait until I try their sandwiches. They looked awesome at the table next to mine. Best of luck, you have a great product. Got some pastry to go on Saturday back to eat on Tuesday.",

From the organization at the front where they hostess stand is to waiting more than 10 minutes for the waiter to even acknowledge us, they need to re-configure their process, or hire more staff.   When I mentioned to the waiter that we had waited so long, he didn't seem to care and just asked for our order, with a little attitude.  If it was a food review alone, I would have given a 5, but service is so important that I'm only giving a 2 star (mainly due to the attitude).     I'll try it again and will review or adjust this review accordingly.    *** SERVICE RECOVERY UPDATE*** The waiter came very quickly with our food order, apologized for the wait and said \"I put your order up next so you wouldn't have to continue waiting.  I also noticed your Yelp review so hope this helps\".  I'm impressed not only with the service recovery but also that they are paying attention to these reviews.  Impressed.  Well done.",

Now, nothing beats a proper NYC bagel, but these are as close as you are going to get in Vegas.They have a MASSIVE selection of cream cheeses with which to dress your bagel, and lots of toppings to select as well.  The holy grail of bagels is the Everything, and mine was done right.  The seed and spice mixture was in perfect proportions, and they held to the bagel with aplomb.  I also found their black & white cookie to be spot on - a light and moderately lemony cake with delicate vanilla and chocolate fondant.  I'd go back just for that.  The staff seemed a bit overwhelmed or perhaps bored while I was there, and I wasn't blown away by the service, but I will be back regardless to try breakfast in the dining room.",

It must be legit.  You seat yourself and read the menu that looks like a newspaper then the server takes your order. For anything to-go, you have to go to the deli/bakery line.  I had such a sugar rush when I ate half a pound of the rainbow cookies. Those treats with the colors of the Italian flag that tastes like almond with apricot jam in each layer and chocolate on top. They're so good I couldn't stop myself from eating them.  I easily spent $56 on rainbow cookies, raspberry rugulach, apple rugulach, black and white cookies, Florentine cookies, linzers, etc.    Their eggs benedict was also yummy.  Great Hollandaise sauce (consistency and flavor).  It comes with potatoes.  I also tried their cheese blintzes with strawberries.  Each blintz was fully stuffed with sweet cream cheese filling.  I could only eat 1.  They also have sandwiches, matzoh ball soup, salmon, white fish, etc. on their menu. Bagels and schmear, meats, monster-sized cupcakes, 7-layer cake, carrot cake, etc in the bakery/deli.   I wish I would have known about this place a long time ago so I could have fed the doctors at work more variety of Kosher treats.  But at the same time, I'm glad I didn't know about this place a long time ago, otherwise, I would be 200lbs heavier by now!",

I have been coming here since they opened in 1996 and have always had an excellent experience. Ma & Pa owned and operated with care which you can tell by the outstanding food quality. Most authentic Jewish Deli and fresh bakery outside of New York City. The pastrami sandwich is the best in all of Las Vegas period!  The soups (matzo ball especially) are amazing and of course the rye bread and traditional cookies are done correctly. It is common for this place to get pretty crazy busy from time to time especially around lunchtime. However they do the best that they can and are always courteous, friendly, and helpful staff. Thank you Bagel Cafe for the years of superb food and fresh bagels!!  Keep up the good work!!!",

There bagels are better than the chain bagel shops in Vegas, they have a wonderful variety of bagels and cream cheeses, and they do some wonderful Jewish classics as well.  One of their most popular items is their matzo ball soup.  I am absolutely a fan!  Theirs is a classic version that highlights the matzo ball...oddly enough.  I used to live down the street from Bagel Cafe.  I ended up rotating through a series of breakfast bagel sandwiches, but one of my favorite is still over-easy egg, ham, and provolone on an everything bagel.  They have such solid ham for a Jewish Deli!  This is a place I want to go to with grandmotherly woman and enjoy some wonderful conversation over breakfast.",

Cream cheese flavors include nova lox, garlic cheddar, olive pimento, veggie, scallion, plus many more that I look forward to trying now that I've locked in on this gem. Every single bagel they offer is super D-lish.  If I had to recommend my favorite bagel/cream cheese combo it would have to be the one and only (that makes me a little weak in the knees to think of it) garlic bagel piled high with some of their nova lox cream cheese.  Most of their breakfast dishes come with potatoes and choice of toast or one those yummilicious bagels.  Self seating.  The service is great; our drinks never reach half full.  Everyone including the table bussers keep a close watch on your drink and make sure to keep it frequently replenished.  We've yet to try any of the lunch dishes here, but today the table beside us ordered some of their overstuffed sandwiches, and they are ridiculously overstuffed.  Weekend word to the wise - wake up early or wait a little bit.  Last weekend we attempted to venture in around 10:30 on a Sunday and there were people lined out the door waiting for a table.",

    "text": "I have been back several times before writing this review update just to make sure all the inconsistency that I have been experiencing is now the way of Bagel Cafe and not just an off day they were having. I'm prepared for the loyal fixtures to be upset, but if you really have been eating here since it opened then you know it's not the same. I first started eating here at Bagel Cafe (I was a teenager) after it opened. It was worth the long wait to get a table as the food was spot on excellent. Sure we all know the best breakfast in town is at the Omelet House on Charleston, but this place definitely came close behind at one point. In the last 6 months I have experienced meals here at Bagel Cafe that were just not worth the money or wait for what you got. They don't even use Boar's Head deli meats anymore! WTH?!?!?!? They use some brand I have never heard of. The taste and quality of the deli meat just isn't the same as it used to be. They claim the bagels are made fresh daily yet they are rock hard. I have never liked the bagels here, but if it's in your name.... live up to it!  As you can tell from my previous review and pictures, I really used to like this place. Consistency is a major issue. The sandwiches used to be made with Boar's Head deli meat and was piled high between the bread of your choice and a real winner. Now you get some other brand of meat just bunched up in a ball between 2 dry pieces of bread. I can do that at home! Then there is breakfast. I usually order breakfast here. The last 3 times the coffee has tasted bitter and nasty. Getting a refill was a major chore as well. I noticed the servers didn't have name tags on my last visit or I would give a proper shout-out to the waitress who has messed up my order lately and has terrible customer service. I ordered \"One Egg any style W/Bacon\" priced at $8.95 and asked for eggs to be scrambled with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Such a simple breakfast right? Apparently not For Bagel Cafe. The breakfast also came with a bagel of my choice and breakfast potatoes. When my food arrived I noticed there was a slice of cheddar cheese on my eggs. UGH! If you don't have shredded cheese just let the customer know so they can maybe make another choice. I would have had the egg over medium or easy to dunk my bacon in if I had known. The \"Asiago\" bagel I had was so tough and hard!  I was with another yelper one of my last visits and showed him how I was able to bang the bagel on the table and it just broke in pieces.  The bacon was terrible. From the picture it looks heavenly, but let me tell you it was rock hard and seemed like it was honestly pulled from the fridge or something. When my meal arrived the bacon was missing, so I informed our waitress and she replies to me \"oh did you want bacon?\" to which I'm like HELL YES why would I have ordered a breakfast that comes with it if I didn't want it? She then brings me the cold/hard bacon and when the receipt comes she charged me $3.50 for a side of bacon. Seriously? It was supposed to come with the breakfast I ordered. She made me feel like I had done something wrong when she actually is a very lousy waitress. The potatoes I had were the only thing edible on the plate and even those aren't the same potatoes as they have had in the past. With this place not being consistent and having waitresses who can't do their job right, I'm going to  BabyStacks Cafe and Omelet House from now on for breakfast and will make the drive to Henderson to eat at Weiss.",

The restaurant is usually  full and parking in the private lot is tight.  It's hard to pick a favorite but the eggs and corned beef hash is excellent. A large portion of hash with your style of eggs, choice of bagel and fruit or cottage cheese. You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches for lunch, large enough to take some home.",

Don't get the egg bagel sandwich for the road.  There is no way you can eat it without sitting down at a table, preferably with a knife and fork.  It's a monster.  The food can take some time but it is worth the wait.  But don't come here and expect to get out the door in five minutes.  If you dine in, they will not let you split a sandwich.  Also, ordering at the dessert counter can be a little frustrating.  We waited for some time and people cut in front of us before the guy behind the counter acknowledged us.  But a minor hiccup for great food.",

But last week after my aunt ordered a cup of matzo ball soup with the matzo ball on the side we had a serious problem. When the soup was brought to us, the cup of soup was half full. We asked for more soup. We, after all, were paying $1 extra to have the matzo ball on the side.  We were told it was a measured amount....that's how they do it. Except it's not and we know because like I said, we've been regulars for YEARS. We asked for the manager who, instead of offering more soup, tried to justify the half cup of broth. So, it would seem that a few cents of broth was worth losing regular customers who have been loyal for almost 2 decades. All we wanted was a cup of soup! They were unwilling to budge and have lost our business.",

I work downtown(ish), so this has been a good place to meet up with friends.    You seat yourself and the menus are already on the table.  They have pretty fast service.  On Wednesday, I had the chicken salad sandwich on a sesame bagel.  Wow!  I was pretty impressed with their chicken salad. The potato salad and the pasta salad (side options) are just OK. The sandwich is why you are there.    They are always busy, which is good for a local business.  I do not recommend paying your server.  Get up off your rear and pay the cashier.  Trust me, you will thank me.  It takes too long to get your change back and the servers are just too busy.    I'll be back soon!",

    "text": "I have such mixed feelings about the Bagel Cafe. I love-like-hate it, all at the same time. So, I will break it down as to why I feel the way I do.  LOVE: Homemade food. Fresh baked breads. House-made Pickles (seriously, they're perfect) Friendly service  Like: Their soups are off the chain (I know it's 100 degrees in Vegas, but soup me!) Corny newspaper menus Selection of fresh baked pastries and cakes Over-stuffed sandwiches.  Hate: WARNING: Don't share your sandwiches (what, the what?! I do what I want with my sammie). Pricing - $7.50 for a cup of soup. Chaotic when entering. There's no \"seat yourself\" sign or anyone really greeting you. How basic and homey the place feels. Bland, uninspired food.  Bagel Cafe is hidden in a Business Park and they're always busy (especially on the weekends - up to an hour wait). IT's got a huge area in the front where you can get deli meats, cheese, chips, sammies, soups, cookies, bagels, and every other sweet confection known to man to-go. There are about 30 tables/booths. There's not a lot of ambiance and all employees where Bagel Cafe polo shirts so they're easy to spot. Bagel Cafe is very hit-or-miss in regards to what you order. My Matzo Ball soup was excellent and full of chicken chunks (and a few small bones), carrots, celery, and noodles. It's tasty, but nothing that makes it memorable. The tuna salad was bland. I hardly ever reach for salt and pepper and I had to! The Nova Platter small was a small amount of lox, olives, sliced tomato, sliced cucumber, and a pickle that was halved, it was $11.95, way too much for mainly salad bar options. I also can't get over the fact that they sell 1/4 & 1/2 lb sandwich options and state DO NOT SHARE. I get that if you are at an AYCE sushi place or dining at a 5 star restaurant, but at a Breakfast/Brunch spot? I do what I want with my sandwich and sharing is caring!  At the end of the day, the BAD outweights the good here. Overpriced, restrictions, dull food, and lack of organization makes this place a \"meh\" in my book.",

Corned Beef on Rye - pretty legit, just slightly drier and sliced thinner than I'm used to but plenty good enough.  Pretty lean too.  The bread was excellent, flavorful and fresh.  Latkes - giant and humongous.  One order can feed a huge family.  Was very dry and probably wouldn't get these again.  Pickles - just my personal preference, I like full sour and these were like half sours.  Meh.  Cole slaw - was on the thinner, drier side too.  Bagels - excellent, big and giant which some may not like but I love the puffier style bagels.  Service - mixed.  Started out pretty good and petered out.  It took forever to get out bill and change back.  Bakery - yum!  The challah is pretty decent and their cookies are tasty.  I'll eventually work my way through all the baked goods, I'm sure.  It's not as good as most of the better delis on the East coast but it's a good enough effort for me to come back when I need a decent deli fix.",

    "text": "It was my friend Ms. W's last morning in town and she specifically requested we come here. On a Sunday around 8:30a we easily found two tables to push together for our party of five adults and one baby in a stroller.   As far as entrees go, I think my hubby made a great choice with the pastrami sandwich. That meat was so flavorful and piled high!  I got a corned Beef and Cheddar omelette with potatoes and an everything bagel. The corned Beef was nothing compared to that pastrami and the omelette wasn't seasoned at all. But the potatoes were good and that bagel was perfect! Honestly, next time I would vote to create my own plate - everything bagel covered in cream cheese, butter and piled high with pastrami.   I also had to try some sweets. I have to say that while the cannoli wasn't for me (the shell was very thick, crunchy and dry) I adored their gluten free chocolate chip cookie. I didn't buy it because of being gluten free, I bought it because it looked good. You see, I'm not a fan of shortbread-type cookies, so these looked more up my alley. And boy were they perfect - all the chewy goodness you could want!  All in all, we would definitely return!",

I'm not sure if the restaurant reuses the bagels served on other tables or the staff ate some of the bagel and wrapped in the bag.. it was disgusting. Please open and check your food while you are in the restaurant if you order take out.  Also I ordered 3 over hard eggs with grilled lemon pepper turkey and sliced tomato. They put homemade home fries instead of tomato in the box. This is not the first time they mess up the order. The turkey tasted so salty.",

Why in the heck would you do a shift change at 1pm when the place is PACKED! I used to love going here to eat, but with terrible service like that I don't think I am going back anymore.

We found NY-style cheesecake, Black & White cookies, rainbow cookies & a selection of Wise-brand snacks.  They offer a lot more than what I can write.

I ordered 1/2 lb. of sturgeon (which is not cheap) among other things. I've purchased poorly cut fish, but I can live with that. However, As I was watching the guy slice it, he sneezed and wiped   his nose with his gloved hand and continued to cut. Yech! I understand that the people cutting the fish here are not as knowledgeable and familiar with these kind of fish, but they need to be trained on how to cut fish  and most of all, GOOD HYGIENE.  I didn't want to make a scene, so I paid, went home and threw it out.  But this was really disgusting and I'm totally turned off to sturgeon.",

I cut into the top, unfortunately I couldn't cut all the way through because the bottom was rock hard. Almost as though it had spent too much time in the microwave to heat up. The meat was also very dry. Our waitress was awesome, I showed it to her and she ask if she could replace it for me. I said sure, I'll try the potato pancake. Again, it was overcooked.

There is nothing better in my opinion than grabbing a cup of matzoh ball soup and a half sandwich from bagel cafe.  The only thing that I don't like about this place is the face that there can sometimes be an extremely long wait when attempting to pick up food from the deli counter.   As for recommendations: the pastrami on rye is killer, as mentioned before, the matzoh ball soup is unreal, and the black and white cookies will change your life.  I love the bagel cafe, and I'm sure you will too!",

I got a literal fist sized portion of Turkey in between 2 slices of rye with no mayo. The Turkey that bulky was super dry and I had to use a lot of mustard to help eat it. I honestly ended up removing half of the meat because no one can eat what they gave me practically... the slaw was average. I assume it's out of a bag. Aside from that this place still doesnt impress me. I'd never give my money to people who insult anyone with special needs but that's just me and I'm still pissed about hearing that conversation from last visit.",

    "text": "This is my favorite bagel spot in Las Vegas. I'm from Connecticut, so I used to take the train to NYC often. That being said, I know a good bagel! I have been trying to hunt down the perfect bagel here in Vegas for a while now and I think this is it.   First off, i'd like to state that this place is a hidden gem. LITERALLY. It took us about 5 minutes to hunt it down in the parking lot! (Hint, its to the left of the Omelet House!)  They serve fresh bagels in different flavors, but me being a \"plain jane\" type I stick to plain. They also have different cream cheese flavors like plain, scallion, strawberry, veggie, etc.  Again, i'm very plain jane so i get plain or scallion! They have different sandwiches and meats/cheeses but I have yet to try them! There's also a variety of cookies and even coffee cake (YUM!).  The place is never really busy (at least whenever i'm there) so we get our pick of tables to sit at. The wait isn't too long, maybe 5 minutes tops. I also think the staff is great here, very friendly and always have smiles on their faces.   Now I don't know about you, but I LOVE cream cheese. These guys give you a hefty portion of cream cheese when serving you and I love it!!! My boyfriend is the complete opposite, he likes very, very, very light cream cheese. Craaazy right?  Anyways, I appreciate a warm toasted bagel with lots of cream cheese-y goodness :) I have also tried their breakfast sandwich and its soooo good! Perfect greasy egg goodness with cheese and bacon on a toasted bagel....YES! I recommend this place to everyone. It's my favorite bagel spot, and reminds me of home. :)",

I will say, it was salty with the olives, pickles, and salmon, but I put more cucumber and cream cheese and YUM. The smoked salmon was actually imported from Brooklyn, NY. It was very thinly sliced (UH-MAZING) and super fresh. I ordered the plain bagel for my lox, but even when they heated it up, it was still cold and not that soft. I looked around and almost all the people in the restaurant ordered breakfast items rather than the bagels.  I also ordered the cup of soup with a side of garden salad and it was really good! I had the matzoh soup and it was good. It tasted almost like chicken noodle soup but different. The garden salad was very big and delicious. I had thousand island dressing on the side.",

But here's the thing - When checking out from this restaurant apparently a different cashier didn't appreciate the way my friend dropped his credit card for payment. He had on our restaurant jacket. I was across the room ordering deli to go and overheard this cashier loudly complaining about my friend and my restaurant. To 2 other cashiers, none of which told her to pipe down and In front of about 10 other customers- it was very crowded and busy. I was called over to pay - wearing the same jacket (but she couldn't see the logo) and this gal mouthed off to me about him. I'll never return and I've been coming for years.

It's an odor that is not the odor of cooked food, it smells rank!  You will see the bakery and deli counters as soon as you walk in.  The selection is limited, the bagels are better at Einstein's bakery and the baked goods are obviously not baked on sight, but shipped in from someplace else.  I've tried several of their baked goods, and none are extraordinary.  Much better pastries can be found at Patisserie Manon on Charleston near Rampart.  As for the food, very overrated.  The food is nothing special and if you go for breakfast the coffee tastes like water. If you live  in or near Summerlin, and want an infinitely better breakfast, try Griddlecakes  in the Von's shopping center on Village Center Circle, or at the new Cracked Egg in the Smith's shopping center on Hualapai and Charleston.  Both are less expensive, have better tasting food,  have better atmospheres without the nauseating smell, and the service is better.",

I have never seen a wait for seating but it always seems busy! Most of the time I just do the take out items, which range from \"mini\" cheesecakes (around $5) to homemade twinkies (with not quite enough filling), to bagel & egg sandwiches(more reasonably priced around $4). Everything is very large but so wonderful, I've never gotten something I didn't like! My favorite dessert was the lemon bar, its amazing! I even opted for one instead of a birthday cake :) The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the price.

Everyone there has always been friendly, service superb, and prices really very reasonable, especially for the quality of food.  Several dishes for under $10, a few that are $11-12.  My survey of the price range is $$, because you won't get out of here without buying enough pastries to feed everyone at work the next day.  They have a deli as well, but I have yet to take advantage of that.  My personal dish of choice is the Brisket and Potato pancakes.  I have tried and tried to make those Potato pancakes at home, but can't seem to nail it.  So until then, I will have to dine here, and resist the pastries.

In the mean time, we split a blueberry muffin that was so delicious and buttery that it was worth the calories! My husband got a ham, egg and cheese on an everything bagel. I ordered a turkey on an everything bagel. They were amazing and definitely the best bagels in the valley.  We came back here a few months later with my mom and sister because I had noticed how delicious the homefries and pancakes looked. I was incredibly impressed with both. The homefries have the perfect amount of seasoning on them, with both crispy parts and soft parts. The pancake was huge and light and fluffy, and almost tasted a little nutty. They were so delicious and you can add on a pancake to any of their breakfasts for just a little bit extra. This place is amazing and they have a huge selection of bagel flavors and a dessert case that will make your salivary glands start pumping...cakes, cookies, pastries, muffins... etc etc. etc. This place knows what they're doing and you wont' be dissapointed. Expect to wait a little bit on weekends and it can be a little cramped, but who cares when you're getting excellent service and the food is amazing!",

    "text": "**Original review from 5/5/2011. Updating new profile.**  Another place I must visit when I'm out in Vegas. Of course, I've only been here 3 times and each time I get the same thing. Lump Crab Eggs Benedict. Heaven in my mouth! I don't come here for the coffee, which is drinkable, but not the best. I come here for this heavenly lump crab dish.... and the deli/bakery items. My mom had me try the potato cakes last time we were there and..... excuse me. Had to take a breather. Just thinking about those delicious, wonderful potato concoctions with the apple sauce.... Yummmmmmmmm.  The cafe service has been great for me each time. The last time I was there was on a Sunday morning and they were jam packed!!! The waitress was great and attentive, even though the place was packed. On busy days, I understand poaching eggs can be a little difficult because there's a lot more to pay attention to, so when I pointed out that my eggs had been overcooked, without hesitation, she comped me for one of my favorite things in the bakery. (I didn't want them remade.... they were still edible)  The bakery staff is why this place didn't receive a 5 star rating from me. Since I'm still new to the place, I didn't know that you had to stand in line at the deli to get service at the bakery. No one spoke up and when I tried to get the attention of one of the guys, I was blown off. When I finally received service, I placed my order and then asked for something from the deli. He treated my request as a big inconvenience. Needless to say, if it's a busy day, I'll just eat at the cafe and leave my bakery/deli order for another, less busy time.  Their food is great. Their bakery and deli items are delicious. I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone, but I would tell them to be patient and try to go when it's not so busy.",

I never made the drive (which is not as far as I tell myself it is) and now that I have finally tried it, I feel like I have wasted the past year of my life.   A good NY bagel had been pretty much impossible to find until I walked in the doors to this place. Now I wish I lived closer... preferably in the kitchen of this place. ***Will work for bagels and rainbow cookies***  Tasty NY Bagels... check Rainbow cookies... check Black and white cookies... check Linzer Cookies... check  The rainbow cookies are where it's at. I never thought I would find rainbow cookies as good as the ones my mom makes but these are right up on that same level. If my mom had charged as much as they do for hers... I wouldn't be living in an apartment right now. Although, I would owe her a LOT of money.  Anyway... they need to open more locations. If anyone from Bagel Cafe reads this... please, please, please open more locations! I'll help with construction. Just feed me!!!!",

The best part about it? They don't taste overly sugary! I could literally eat a cookie, a black coffee and a jalapeno and cheese bagel every day.   The ONLY reason this place gets knocked off of the perfect 5 stars is because of service at the cashier. Just because it is a New York-style eatery, does not mean you can treat your customers like they're Bostonians. The cashier was pretty rude when I was taking out my money to pay as if I should've already had it out and ready...really?  Anyways, if you don't mind the people when you eat somewhere, definitely come here! If you do mind service, STILL come here, but bite your tongue when speaking to the cashier.",

    "text": "This is an update to  a previous review I did in 2014.  I wanted to give Bagel Cafe one more try, and probably this will be my last try.  I ordered a corned beef sandwich - no sides, no other items.  Total bill:  $14.00 (the sandwich was $12.95 plus tax).  Yes, the sandwich is large and can  be split between two people, but really?   $14.00 for a sandwich? (and a pickle that comes with it).  I will say, this time the pickle was better than last time, it tasted like a real kosher pickle instead of a raw cucumber.  However, the corned beef had tough, chewy portions that were difficult to swallow, and as last time, it was on the dry side, so I'm still very unimpressed with the quality of their corned beef and won't be doing that again. Also, I didn't see  prices posted anywhere. If there's a price list, I couldn't find it.  So, I suffered from \"sticker shock\" when I paid the bill.    They must have raised their prices because last time my total was around $16.00 for a sandwich, cole slaw and a bear claw.  I thought this time it would be  less by at least several dollars, since I was only getting a sandwich and nothing else, but obviously not.    I'm reaching the point of simply giving up on 90% of the places in town except fast food because everything is so outrageously expensive in ways that really can't be justified.  If you're okay with paying $14.00 for a corned beef sandwich which  isn't that great, go ahead.  I'm not. .",

Staff: I'm not sure why but literally all the employees have a bad attitude when it comes to customer service. This has been said time and time again on these reviews and I'm not sure why the problem has not been addressed. Is it really that hard to find workers with a pleasant customer service attitude these days?

I find the bagels at other bagel shops (like Einstein Bagels) more flavorful and less gummy and I was not impressed with the black cookie I received with my order. The bakery items in the cakes and specialty item case looked really tasty. I also saw they had halvah, not commonly available in Vegas.  The schmear was terrific (I had the low-fat veggie) and the vegetables on my asiago bagel were fresh. The pickle was so fresh that it tasted much more like salty cucumber than pickle. My meal came with chips. When I asked to change the plain chips for another flavor of the same brand and size, I was told: \"This is what comes with the meal.\"  The service is typical New York--they weren't mean, but they certainly won't go out of their ways to greet you with a smile or make you feel comfortable.",

I've been coming here for years and have never had any complaints on service or food. It is what it is. Like a real deli, the sandwiches and portions are huge, so you really can split it ($2 split plate) or just order a 1/2. They have large breakfast options like French toast, omelettes and of course- bagels- all varieties, made fresh every day, soups (matzo ball seems to be the favorite) and even Italian sodas. Although I've become less of a meat-eater over the years, I still come here because the food is good. I recommend the salmon salad (platter or sandwich). The menu is pretty extensive, so take your time because you may need a minute to figure out what to order.",

It wasn't super busy yet and we were able to get a table right away. Noted! By the time we left, the place was packed and there was a wait.  I do want to start by saying that all the issues that came up were remedied best they could be, but I still left slightly disappointed. I ordered the egg white omelet and my plate had a hair in the food. This seems to be a trend for me lately when I dine with this group of friends. Also noted! The server took my plate away, was very apologetic, and brought me a new dish as fast as the kitchen could push it out. My replacement omelet was overdone and my bagel was burnt.  Thankfully the cinnamon rolls there saved the day and I will gladly pop in to order all the pastries and bagels to go.",

They said it would take 15-20 minutes until it was ready. I arrived 30 minutes later only to find that they \"lost my ticket\" and the order was not ready. It is always something there. I was on MY lunch time, I do not have time to sit around and wait for them to remake it because they \"lost my ticket\"..... That is WHY I call ahead of time to make sure that it is ready...

Honestly the food is very over priced in my opinion, but it's good and let's face it, where else do we have to go in Vegas besides here for bagels that are good ! I do love the matzo ball soup!   The only negative , as to why they only get three stars is the customer service! It needs improvement, as I've been there many times and always feel it's lacking! The last visit my boyfriend ordered take out, two soups, and some bagels! Sadly when we got home , we noticed our pricey chicken noddle soup had zero chicken and hardly anything but broth, clearly we were unhappy but whatever we'll just call up and get reimbursed which who really cares, we go there often so even a note on the account for next time works. Well that didn't happen, the manager told us to keep one, and bring it back so we can see before they close, umm we live on the other side of town! That's all they could do in order to give us a new soup? Who seriously  wanted to drive all the way back when we drove 30 minutes just for the soup!   ***So basically if they mess up any take out order, remember to keep the food and drive back and show them since they can't just leave a note for the next time! Seriously guys?**",

They brought me out a sample and it was perfect. Just like back home. I went with the pastrami and corned beef sandwich. They said it was the large one.  I thought it was a little small but I paired it with their matza ball soup. Mom don't get mad but this soup was so good. It just needed a little pepper. Other than that my dining partner had the mushroom cheese omelette. It and the soup came with our choice of bagel. They have over 20 selections of fresh made bagels. I took mine home and toasted it up. They give you a generous portion of creme cheese to go with it as well. They had fresh lox and sturgeon and a huge variety of spreads and creme cheeses. They even give you a plate of sweet cranberry creme cheese and rotated baguette points while you wait for your meal. Can't wait to go back and try a lox tomato onion and capers on an onion bagel. What a place !! I spoke to the manger and he was so nice. Our server Rachel checked on us but was not intrusive. She was sweet. We thought it was so busy but she said nope. It comes in waves.

The only thing that might be a downside is a waiting list over the weekends. 15-25 min.  Great place overall! Highly recommended.  Trust me. I know food! :)",

    "text": "I challenge anyone reading this review to taste the \"cream cheese\" from the Bagel Cafe and ask yourself if you taste dairy of any kind.  Cream cheese, be it in cheese cake, on a bagel,  to make icing, or as a dip has a creamy authentic taste, one that is missing from the substance being sold at the Bagel Cafe.  I got two bagels with two different flavors and my Mom and I had the same complaints. Our complaints were then confirmed after swapping bagels and realizing they were both poor.  The consistency of their \"cream cheese\" is more comparable to whipped lard or butter than creamy and tasty.  Even when cream cheese is flavored, you can still taste the dairy or it's tartness.  I'm sure if I ordered plain cream cheese it would be authentic cream cheese but the ones that are flavored, are masking some poor quality goop that they're passing off as cream cheese.  I ate a quarter of  my $5 bagel and tossed the rest.  For that price, you guys need to stop cutting corners and serve real cream cheese.....  Even Einstein does better in the cream cheese department.   Your bagels are great but paired with your goop, they're trash.........  TRASH I SAY!!!!",

And their Bagel selections are complete with Bagels and Bialys( not sure if that's spelled correctly) Delicious!! The bakery section is complete with everything your heart desires.

My dad always says, \"If you see a lot of senior citizens at a restaurant, then you can't go wrong.\" They are on a fixed income, so they want delicious food and large portions at a reasonable price. Although I am not yet age privileged,  I want those same things too. With that being said, I hit the jackpot because at the Bagel Cafe, there was a sea of silver hair.  It is your typical Jewish deli with an amazing bakery in the front. I have probably tried all of their pastries a few times over. Today, I grabbed a booth and enjoyed brunch with my family.  Their servers work very hard and they are top notch! One of my biggest pet peeves is when a server is either too anxious or too slow with the check. My server's timing was just right.  We ordered the Challah french toast, veggie omelet, with home fries, and a bagel and a Belgium waffle. Everyone in our party was satisfied. Next time, I'm going to try the matza ball soup.",

We came early on a Saturday and thank goodness because it got really busy but the time we left (9:30ish).  It's a restaurant / bakery / NY style deli - wow!  Here's the rundown on what we've tried so far:   -- Biscuits & sausage gravy with eggs and sausage patties   I'm a country gravy girl and this was pretty good!   -- Corned beef hash  Best we've had in town!  My Honey actually ordered this and I ended up eating half his and giving up half my biscuit :)  -- Egg salad and BLT sandwiches - both good, hard to mess up a BLT.  -- Bagel with veggie cream cheese. They make their spreads in-house and they put it on generously! I'll get it on the side next time because the bagel itself is delish.  -- Rougalades (sp?) all yum  Taking my son this weekend and can't wait to try the potato pancakes and pecan roll.  Would be 5 stars if the service was better, but hey it's a popular place so it get pretty busy and there is a wait - worth it to me though!",

It usually depends on how busy they are. They have the rule: You can't be seated unless your entire party is present, but that isn't consistent either. They will ask over and over about your stroller if you have one...where will you put it, can it be broken down for fear it will take up soooooo much space. During one visit the stroller issue was so bad they said it was a fire issue. I had to let them know that it would fold down smaller than most as it was a jogger stroller. So leave your stroller in the car to avoid snotty questions or if you dislike condescending tones.   To be fair, some staff members are amazingly sweet. One person at the to go check out gave my baby his favorite cookie on the house and talked to him for a few minutes.   We would frequent this establishment more if their staff were consistently kind and professional.",

    "text": "I had heard of the bagel cafe from my wife's sister when she came and helped us move. She had said she definitely recommended it. So since it was my mother's birthday and my wife and I wanted to take her out for a morning breakfast we decided to try the bagel cafe.  When we arrived we definitely noticed that the parking spots were for compact vehicles, since there was someone who didn't get that message and had their 1 ton truck taking up 2 parking spots. After finding a parking spot we walked in and were quickly greeted and found a spot to sit. It was my first time to this location so I was not sure if this was like a sandwich shop a pastry shop or a restaurant, well apparently it's all in ONE which is quite awesome I love one stop shops.   After being seated we sat and waited at the table for menus. The bus boy came and asked if we wanted drinks. We ordered 1 coffee and 2 waters and again we waited. The waitress came with a pen and pad and asked us if we were ready to order. We all said we were waiting for the menus. She quickly apologized and informed us that the menus were located at the end of the table and was newspaper like menus.   We looked through the menu which seemed a bit long for a breakfast/lunch establishment I believe that even in the last pages there were dinner plates which confused me a bit as there not open past 5.   We ordered a cup of Matzo Ball soup, a biscuits and gravy plate, a corn beef hash and egg plate and one fresh veggie omelet. The matzo ball soup came with one ignoramus matzo ball and it was piled high with vegetables and chicken. My mom being the very whitey person that she is quickly reminded me how she had made me a similar soup when I was a kid and how I complained to her that what she served me was clearly not matzo ball soup and it was chicken noodle soup with a matzo ball in it LOL! Well that's exactly what I got here. My mom is a sous-chef at petrossian bar at the Bellagio and she drilled me at how matzo ball soup can be made in many different ways. Well I don't prefer this kind all though it was hearty and the matzo ball was delightful. I still prefer a matzo ball soup with just matzo ball not with chicken and vegetables. The portions reminded me allot of hash house a go go. The portions were rather big and hearty. The biscuits were soft and the gravy was very exquisite a change from hash house because there biscuits seemed to be a bit hard and these were really soft and awesome when paired with the gravy. The veggie omelet was a veggie omelet nothing spectacular. The corn beef hash was tasty especially coming from me because I'm not a corn beef fan and this one was defiantly cooked correctly and seasoned just right.  I think the customer service was sub-par. I could tell that the waitress was definitely trying to be nice and helpful however I felt at times I was forgotten we only had 1 water refilled and my mother's coffee was never refilled or even offered to be refilled. We might possibly try them again.",

The omelets were delicious, the blintzes a little dry and the coffee could be better. The service was definitely NOT attentive. The seating was uncomfortable as our little table had to accommodate 4 with a full menu. The furniture of tables, chairs and boots were dated and pretty beaten up, not very appealing, and definitely too crammed next to each other. After lunch we took several pieces of pastry to go and it was delicious.",

The sandwiches are HUGE, and this is not a joke or understatement. When I order the brisket sandwich (YUM), I always have to pull half the meat off so I can fit the sandwich in my mouth - the tastiest of problems. Their bagels are really good, and their cream cheese options are even better - the cinnamon walnut raisin cream cheese is to die for. I even took my leftover cream cheese home once because it's that good. If you like garlic, I'd also recommend their garlicky breakfast options over in the deli area.  Their bakery/pastry foods are the stuff dreams are made of. I avoid the cookies as they are too crunchy for me, but the cannolis, ruggulahs, cakes, and the like are addictive. I bought and drove their baked goods four hours away to California to make a good impression on my future in-laws. It worked like a charm.  Bagel Cafe gets jammed up for breakfast/brunch on the weekends, but it's totally worth the wait and you'll easily understand why after eating there once. It's a little more expensive that somewhere like IHOP or a more casual sandwich place, but I still go when I can because it's delicious.   Bagel Cafe - the perfect way to enter a Sunday brunch food coma.",

They were almost inedible. They were so dry and corned beef had no flavor. I was embarrassed to tell my husband how much I paid. Have been to much better delicatessens.",

After all it was well after 1 o'clock and the lunch crowd should have moved on.  Sure enough, we were seated immediatly and put in an order for soup and two sandwiches, a glass of water and a soda.  Anxious to move on with the day's agenda we got our soup and drinks instantly.  Then we waited and waited and waited some more for two simple sandwiches.  After a number of apologies from our server and another 30 minutes, they finally arrived.  Food is always great here, but the kitchen staff needs to step up its speed game.",

    "text": "Oh my god, how I MISS The Bagel Cafe! My fiance and I moved to paradise, excuse me, North County San Diego, two years ago from Las Vegas, and we don't often miss it there. But I still think about The Bagel Cafe and I get super peanut-butter-and-jealous when I see my friends check in there on Facebook.   If you're wondering what's good here, the answer is everything, seriously. The best part of coming here is buying deli stuff on the way out. My fiance was obsessed with the pumpkin cream cheese for awhile, and I liked bringing the deli tuna home and eating that for a few days. It kept fresh for awhile and it is the best tuna I've ever had. Nothing else compares. Obviously their bagels are the best. You cannot beat them. Also, I have to mention my family is Jewish and I hardcore judge any Jewish deli's chicken soup and matzo balls. Theirs doesn't beat my mom's, but it comes damn close. It beats mine, as hard as that is for me to admit! Plus when you order a soup, you get a bagel! My fiance loved their eggs and sausage specials and he'd try a different bagel/cream cheese combo with it every time we came. I'm a huge fan of ALL of their desserts too. They have a ton to choose from. It's been awhile so I can't remember specifically, but we'd always leave with a few and there were never any leftovers past the first day!  On top of the food being delicious, the service was always on point. Even when my brother and I took our mom there for Mother's Day and they were super busy, the service was great and quick.  My fiance and I still have not found a deli in San Diego to compare to the Bagel Cafe. Next time I visit, that's the first place I'll be hitting up!",

My wife ordered some bagels for her workdays and some cream cheese.  They have 7 different cream cheese selections. The bagels are soft and have lots of flavor.  We got green olive and herb cream cheese.  Both were outstanding.   We also ordered lunch.  She ordered the two meat sandwich with Hebrew National salami and bologna.  Wow we're those two meats good.  We already love the hot dogs, the salami and bologna are just as good.  I ordered the Reuben with corned beef and pastrami.  Very crispy buttery bread, good sauerkraut, and 1000 island dressing.  Best rueben I have had in Vegas so far.  I will be back for it again.   The dessert case had a lot to choose from.  We got a black and white cookie, a homemade Twinkie and some other pastries.  All were really good.   I would recommend this deli to anyone.  We will be back soon.",

The reason why is only 3 stars... Their coffee is terrible. 1st time we went here years ago I hated their coffee, so we gave it a shot a couple years later.... The coffee still suck!! I investigated and peek at their coffee area nd they use this company farmers coffee. It was so watered down, so I don't come here for breakfast or lunch if I want good coffee or come here order water and head to Starbucks, coffee bean or any coffee house I feel that day",

The wait also went by quickly because they have tons of baked goods to nosh on. I grabbed a perfect black and white cookie.   For breakfast, I ordered 3 eggs, bacon and a super egg bagel with nova schmear. The bagel and bacon were great, but I was a little disappointed by the eggs.   One thing I missed out on were the coffee shakes. Next time I come, I'll try one of these.   Considering how busy they were the service was good too.   See you next Sunday.",

Been here a few times before, got seated quickly with a party of 6. Took a little bit to order but that was okay as at least we were given our drinks. I ordered a bagel breakfast sandwich with cheese and one egg, and some breakfast potatoes. Both were alright, not the best, but it left me satiated.   My crazy boyfriend however, had the LARGEST slice of tiramisu cake I have ever seen in my life. I thought it was the entire cake. He downed that thing like a champ! I didn't take a bite but it sure looked good!  Overall this cafe is alright - not my favorite, but I don't oppose to it either. Kind of limited selection for vegetarians which is why for me it is one way or the other. I will have to come in some other time to grab some black and white cookies from their bakery, as their desserts seem to be more mouth-watering than their other goods. Maybe I'll find something yummier next time.",

Sometimes you get pastrami that's a little dry so their consistency of quality could be better.  Also have sat down to have breakfast there a  number of times.  Sometimes it's delicious and sometimes it's surprisingly mediocre.  Stick to their french toast as opposed to their omelet.  Bagels and cream cheese are always top quality there as well.    Their desserts are huge and I've found them to be incredibly mediocre.  I know Jewish delis traditionally have those big desserts - but I'm not interested in paying like $5 for a big pile of flour and sugar thrown together.  Make it smaller and I'll pay the $5 for a quality product.",

    "text": "So by now you know we eat out a lot.  We eat out with our kids at restaurants probably more than any other family in LV!!  Bagel Cafe is about a mile away, so it's been another stand-by...but not anymore.  First, their breakfast food and sandwiches are still great.  That's probably never going to change.  But we don't go there for dinner anymore like we used to.  Maybe you don't order a steak at a place called Bagel Cafe, but the last two times my wife wanted steak (while the kids wanted Matzoh Ball soup and stuffed cabbage!), the steak was nearly inedible - gristly, thin, not cooked evenly, and I would hate to see the expiration date on the meat, as it tasted pretty rancid.  I can almost picture a \"Gordon Ramsay discovers something disgusting\" Kitchen Nitemares moment, covering his mouth over a trash bin after a tirade of expletives.  Which brings me to my other HUGE gripe about Bagel Cafe....and it's not pleasant.  The bathrooms...are disgusting...'nuff said.  Maybe it's a result of the huge traffic they get for morning/brunch, and they simply can't stop to check/clean the bathrooms during the day??  There's no excuse for disgusting bathrooms at a restaurant, and probably no greater turn-off, not to mention the health issues.  Clearly, dinner is not their target meal, though they still list many great specials, at least the nights they're open past 5 p.m. (any day except Sun-Tue, I thnk).  To be fair, the traditional NY Deli type items are still great (yes, I too love tongue, liver, whitefish, and other hard-to-find deli sandwiches; knishes, etc.).  Bagel selection?  Fabulous.  The pastries still LOOK as good as ever, but sometimes, after 2-3 bites, I wish they were less sweet, less BIG, and tasted a little more 'special'.  Matzoh Ball soup?  Excellent, if you like the rich, thick, ultra-brothy variety that sometimes even have the layer of fat/oil floating on top.  Now I happen to like that, but today's finicky health-conscious 2010 diner may be immediately turned off....and watch out for the occasional bone shard!   My last gripe about Bagel Cafe?  The tabletops are too small!  Maybe I have a sense of False entitlement for comfortable seating, but with the huge platter-size dishes (and additional plates for 'sides') they use, a 4-top with 4 people, even when 2 are kids, becomes a challenge in space planning and creative plate stacking.  OK, maybe this gets people in and out quicker...but I have to note this here as a legitimate complaint.  The booths are slightly roomier, but not much.  I feel like I'm sitting in the back row of a Southwest 737 with my seatback and traytable in their upright positions....  I wish I could be nicer to this place!  The servers are friendly and fun, and the kitchen staff often comes out and yuks it up with the clientele.  Maybe they oughta have someone also make rounds of the bathrooms, too...   All this adds up to my first 1-star rating...  Oh yeah...someone else mentioned the cashiers.  YES, I've had problems related to this also.  About 2 years ago, I saw triplicate charges coming through on my credit card about a month after dining here.  They resolved the problem by running credits through after the fact, but I had to bring it to their attention.  Also, if you watch your account like I do, you'll notice that they take FOREVER to clear your payment, which is always an indication that their internal controls and policies may be lacking.",

Usually I go to Costco and pick up their bagels, but my dad ever the bagel fiend, went online and hunted for a bagel bakery. Lo and behold - Bagel Cafe! So I googled it up, and looked at the Bagel choices - YUUUUMMMINESS! There are 22 varieties - japeno cheddar, asiago, spinach and feta, sourdough, the everything bagel! Ok mouth is watering now. You can call your take out order in, and have it ready for you even! So I picked out my bagel choices and handed my dad the list to walk in and get, and figured on a 10 minute wait or so. Two minutes later he's walking back out bagels in hand! So have to give mad props for prompt customer service! Will have to wait another time to eat out, but will definitely come back this way.",

I watched 3-4 girls standing around behind the counter about 5 feet away from me, talking for a good 5 minutes without so much as a sideways glance.  I don't think I've ever had so much trouble getting an ice cube in my life.",

Nice neighborhood in Summerlin, clean and pretty new.  In front of you when you walk in are large displays with smoke fish and other bagel condiments, various fresh bagels, and a nice size offering of huge cookies and pastries, including chocolate chunk cookies, macaroons, rugelach, rice pudding, flan, turnovers, brownies, and more!  This is a \"seat yourself\" place with quick, friendly service and a whimsical menu that looks and feels like a small newspaper.  The menu offerings are numerous!  I had the biscuits and gravy - yum!  They make their own biscuits and they were soooo much better than the kind you can make at home and they were huge!  My husband had matza ball soup.  After tasting it I understand why they were rated one of the top soup places - wow!  The prices were very impressive!  My humongous biscuits and gravy were only $5.95, $7.50 with two eggs.  I doubt we will often travel across town to eat here, but if you're in the area it is well worth it!",

I was pleased that it was more spacious than I expected, with tables and a counter for seating. The bagel selection was good and the pastries looked wonderful. But I was here for a favorite--bagel, schmear, and lox. The first annoyance was the lack of a \"please seat yourself sign\", but that was minor. The next annoyance was that there was no bagel-shmear-lox item on the menu. I had to order a bagel and a small Nova platter. The waitress was good in asking if I wanted capers, as of course I did. The bagel did come with an adequate amount of schmear; I often have to ask for more but here I didn't. The small Nova platter was a major disappointment. There were a lot of greens (more than I needed of lettuce, tomato slices, cucumber slices, and a half a pickle) but an insignificant amount of lox. The good delis I know in Cleveland and New York would have been ashamed. I am sure that much else is good, but this is not.",

As usual the food was good and as usual my wife wanted to take home a pastry as did my friends.  There was quite a long line to pay as Sundays are always busy.  I wait in the pay line while the other 4 check out the goodies.  After about 5 minutes it's my turn to pay and I ask the cashier to add an eclair.  In a not so great tone of voice she says \" we are too busy, you have to order over there\".  I was taken aback by not only the tone but in the past I always ordered my to go pastry from the cashier.  I will grant that I usually eat thier on Monday\"s when they are not as busy but I became defensive from her barking at me.  I stated my unhappiness and she asked if I wanted to speak to the manager and I stated I did so she pointed him out to me.  I walked over to him and explained that I have always ordered my pastries as I was paying and he told me something to the effect of, We don't let the cashiers handle money and food because some money comes in from sick people, casinos and from a \"strippers ass crack\". REALLY! Stuff happens and I sure don't want to take such a good deli off my list but I felt pretty small at that point.  If the cashier was nicer in her response from me I would not have questioned going to another line, but the manager was icing on the cake. We can all have a bad day and maybe I could have handled everyhing different on my end but the attitude and response said to me they just don't really appreciate my patronage",

    "text": "Let me preface by stating the food was VERY good. The people that work there on the other hand, not so much. First off, our waitress talked so fast, we couldn't even answer before she was already making up our mind for us. We were supposed to have an option as our side (potatoes, fruit, or bread) and she never asked us what we wanted so I assumed that we didn't get a side with our meal. We did, she just assumed we wanted potatoes. Which I did not. We were served our meal without silverware. And after our meal, we went to the bakery and stood at the counter for minutes with staff walking past before anyone asked us if we had been helped. We noticed we were charged $3.25 for a potato pancake at our table, but they were at the bakery for $2.25. When I asked the cashier why we were charged more she gave me a snotty attitude and said it's cause they \"warm it up.\" Seriously?! Starbucks warms your baked goods for free! When I told her it was silly she rolled her eyes and said \"it's the labor charge.\" I'm thinking \"OMG your ridiculous\" but these words stayed in my head. I wanted to slap her. Then another staff member who overheard said \"it's because it comes with bread.\" To which I replied \"well, we didn't get bread.\"  The service was just downright ridiculous. I was so annoyed walking out of there. Seriously though, the food was great.",

    "text": "If you want a nice breakfast out in Vegas, go here. Their bakery and deli counter is the best feature of this place; they have a huge selection of decadent desserts, meatz, cheezez, and of course, bagelz. It's easy and quick to get your order and get out when ordering at the counter. The last time we went there my gal and I got a raspberry (strawberry? can't remember exactly) danish and it was pretty damn good. I'm sure there are some desserts in there that are a bit dry but overall it's a win-win. I'd prefer to get a bag o' bagels over dining in and getting a bagel entree.  Sunday morning breakfast is a nice atmosphere because it's quite bustling--however, it might be a while before you are seated and the service may seem a bit moony and often cold. I suggest getting an omelette when dining in with a side bagel if you're dying for a nice big breakfast because the other big breakfasts aren't really that appetizing. Not that the omelettes are supermodels, but they're pretty great.  Overall, it's a pretty good place. If you're visiting LV, it's far enough away from the strip that it makes it nice to get away from that snake-pit but close enough that you don't have to drive hours for a simple meal. Good luck finding a place to park as their lot sux and is surrounded by dentists.",

    "text": "The Bagel Cafe has to be one of the best breakfast (and lunch) spots in Vegas. It has character, they make their customers feel like family and the food is amazing. One of the things I feel like many Las Vegans complain about is the lack of these types of family owned restaurants. Since this is right by my house, I eat there almost 2-3 times per month.  It is perfect for takeout or sit-in, they also have a huge selections of desserts, which are perfect if you just want a little something to crave your sweet tooth or you are looking for a full on cake to bring to a party.  For breakfast I am hooked on the veggie omelet, with sliced tomatoes and an everything bagel. (The lite scallion cream cheese is my weakness!)   They actually have good strong house coffee too!  For lunch their fresh tuna and egg salad sandwiches are so good and HUGE!  One of things that continues to draw me into this place is that unlike most breakfast places you don't feel like you are consuming a thousand calories! Their food tastes fresh and healthy! Of course if you get Biscuits and Gravy or something like that you are probably looking at a boat load of calories/fat, but overall I don't feel like they cover their food in butter or grease.",

Just let me spell it out right now, my breakfast was edible. I can't even remember what I had. Typical and boring. My bagel and cream cheese were edible too.  Why 4-star? Well, let me tell you the story...  While we were waiting, I had a chance to glance at the dessert and pastry sections. I don't have a sweet tooth. So the selection was just yawning. And against my religion, they were twice the price than those in southern CA.  Why 4-star?  Well, I spotted the sugar free apple and regular peach pies. They were heavy and delicious looking. So I bought one each on the impulse. After I tasted it later, the flavor were GOOD, but it's too mushy underneath. I had to \"bake\" it upside down and inside out, to firm up the texture.  Well, that's not a 4-star experience. You're right. There are more to it...  While I was biting my breakfast item, I saw this bread with the corner of my eyes. This pile of breads was sitting on top of the shelf hiding behind the row of tall metal trays of baked carb. Memory flashback....  I had munched on freshly baked ambrosia tasting bread cooked by a friend in a ranch just half a year ago. It was good not just when it came fresh out of the oven, but as good when it was French toasted in thick slice on a grill.  The bread was challah and it was braided. So I bought one large loaf on the impulse. $5. That's the 2nd time in one day in one restaurant. And it was good and delicious.  So diners, I bet the items on the menu were good. That's why the restaurant was busy. My eyes were really set on the Challah.",

That being said, I am upset with this place.  I keep coming back since I love the food but each time I do, I remember why it takes me so long to come again.  The servers are typically not nice.  They do not wait on me promptly and are rude.  And its a passive aggressive kind of rude with a fake smile.  I have had one nice server and thats it.  Most times, it takes them forever to even come over initially. The tables are consistently not well bussed either.  One time I was here there were crumbs on the chair.  I asked for it to be wiped down politely and was told that they are not supposed to wipe the chairs (huh?).  I totally didn't get that so questioned it and she said it isn't good for the seats and that \"it is only crumbs\" and then wiped it.  Seriously- for the prices of food here, one is entitled to sit on a clean chair and not in someone else's mess.  Especially since the price for several items goes up when you sit versus get it at the counter.  I also didn't appreciate bones in the whitefish salad last I ate it though I understand it happens.",

The feeling going there is just like an old school Jewish deli back on the East Coast.  Get there before 10 in the morning on the weekends because it gets really busy.  Fantastic place and I would recommend it to anyone.",

They also have the biggest variety of bagels and cream cheese i have ever seen.   I sat down, menus are pretty cute, they are newspapers. The food was out of this world! Everything was fresh and I enjoyed every bit of breakfast. I had the white fish salad and an egg, sausage, tomato bagel.  I didn't give it five stars because of the service. They were quick to put my order in and i did receive my food not shortly after. However the waitress was overwhelmed with tables to get me my check. That part took almost twenty minutes. The staff does all help each other out and work together, which you don't see many places. I recommend going, just not when you are in a giant rush.",

It's loud and noisy also. The portions are big and the flavor is even bigger! I recommend the jalapeno cheese bagel with  regular cream cheese or the jalapeno cream cheese. Yummy with a spicy kick. All of their bagels and spreads are homemade too! They also serve breakfast, lunch, & I think dinner.  Their steak & egg breakfast is so yummy. As is their club sandwich. They also have a bakery section where they have all kinds of treats to choose from. Tiramisu, cookies, cakes, brownies, ginormous cinnamon rolls, muffins, pies, and lots of other things.  It's a very cute mom & pop setting with amazing food, service, and a great atmosphere. Not a good place if you want peace & quiet but it's a good place if you want a good hearty meal!",

I'm actually upset with myself for not reviewing this place the moment I opened my yelp account.  Its one of the only New York style Jewish delis in Vegas. Their baked goods are all excellent. There is nothing that makes me happier then having someone bring me their bagels and schmear. Well except for getting a plate of Lox with the bagel.   The only problem is this place is popular and is usually busy, especially so during peak hours on the weekends. Usually I just go before work by myself and eat at the counter so the wait is not bad but I see a lot of people waiting.     For lunch they have awesome deli sandwiches. I go here anytime I need to get my pastrami and cheesecake fix on!",

    "text": "Add this long overdue review to the others that sing the praises of this efficiently-run local deli. When eating out can play it safe for breakfast and order a simple standby OR you can explore a bit of culture via a thoughtful menu with quality ingredients.  The thing I love about The Bagel Cafe (TBC) is that here you will get a great meal no matter your breakfast habits. I wish I could say that I choose a unique breakfast when I come to TBC, but I do not. I order eggs (scrambled or poached), bacon, bagel, and fruit whenever I come. When I'm ready to venture out of my comfort zone, I'll order the smoked fish or hand sliced nova platter. It sounds dull, but I am proud to say that of the MANY times I have eaten here I have never been disappointed. Sure there are some slight variations in the food preparation, but the quality of the ingredients and care in preparation at this place never changes.   A NOTE ABOUT THE BOOTHS: We seated ourselves and moved form one booth (too much sun) to another and discovered something unexpected. The tables at both booths were set farther back than we felt comfortable. Usually a booth table will be fairly close to your body, but I had to lean in during the meal to be closer to my plate. I am sure that people who need a it more space are more comfortable as a result of the change.   FOOD: My NY mom and I visited recently and the cultural gap between us couldn't have been more evident than in our plates. I got the usual (eggs, bacon, bagel, fruit, with cottage cheese) while she ordered the overstuffed pastrami with chopped liver. People like me, looking for a meal we can order in any restaurant in the valley, will want to keep coming back to this place. They care about what they put on your plate in this place and they cook the food right. You won't be disappointed in dry, overcooked eggs here. And yes, as many have said, the bagels are amazing. I prefer the veggie spread--there is no equal in this town. The bacon has changed over the years, and I wish it was less salty, but it is always thick cut and flavorful.  Mom's pastrami was outstanding.  If, like me, you are accustomed to thinly sliced, rubbery meat, you will have to rethink your relationship with this delicious smoked meat.   When the waitress didn't bring our large fruit cup with the meal,I figured she'd forgotten and I wasn't worried about reminding her. A few minutes later she set down a cocktail-type glass stacked with fresh fruit arranged in the shape of a flower arrangement with pineapple, kiwi, banana, strawberries, and pear. It was a smart way for TBC to remind it's customers that they care about small touches.    Everything is good here.  I can't wait to get back.",

I visited this place with my parents  Who are from Ca visiting and wanted them to  Have a good experience. I also had my 2 children  With me. We was excited because everything on  The menu seemed really good. We ordered a lot!  Of food. We hadn't eaten that day, saving our appetite for this place. My daughter had a corn beef sandwich and it was just Ok. Nothing great.  My parents each had a full sandwich, I can't recall what type. They each had a hotdog as well. We also had bagel chips and each of us had a knish. And I had a grilled pastrami and corn beef combo sandwich And we also had a few desserts.. everything was was just mediocre. Some things were not good at all. Especially the fries, yuk! The biggest issue, however was not the food. Even though it wasn't very good, we still ate it and didn't complain. But my 6 year old son ordered the kids meal chicken strips, which was like $4.99 or something and the chicken was hard as a rock! There was no way he could have eaten it. Now, mind you at one point our waitress was missing, she never came back to check on us after the food came out. And everything came out one meal at a time, which was very annoying. Especially when there's five starving people. She was very! Slow and took forever. But still no one said anything. She finally came back and asked how everything was, I told her politely that everything was fine except for my son's chicken strips were not edible, especially since he has difficulties swallowing. She took them away in a very rude way and said she will tell the manager. The manager, I wish I knew his name! Was probably one of the worst! Managers I ever seen in customer service. He approached me in a very rude way and the first thing that came out of his mouth was, your son didn't even try a bite! How can I take them off your bill! I explained to him that he did try, but was scared to eat anymore because he has difficulties swallowing hard food, and then the jerk said, that's YOUR PROBLEM! as a mother you should have known not to order him chicken strips. I was in Shock and disbelief. I told him my son was totally fine eating chicken strips, but those were like trying to eat a rock! It seemed very clear to me that I was getting nowhere with this rude cranky manager. My parents were also in disbelief because of his ugly attitude. He didn't take it off the bill and we just paid and left. Over all, this place was a nightmare. We paid a lot of money for the mediocre food we just wanted to be treated with kindness and consideration like anyone else, but no the jerk MOM shamed me over a $4.99 kids meal.  I hope every day he has to endure extremely negative customers just as bad as he is.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this spot more, I really did! The service leaves something to be desired, and they definitely seem to have good and bad days. The food is relatively good, but I do find it hit or miss. The menu is huge, notoriously in my experience it leaves a lot of room for flaws and inconsistency. When you try to pay, you almost always have to wait for somebody to get over to the cashier area.   The take out area is much better, and since my numerous visits here I've pretty much given up on eating in and just get things to go. The bagels are great, and a toasted everything bagel with the cream cheese just oozing all over still warm when you walk out and bite in...there's little that beats it. That is why I will still frequent here, but probably the only reason. For this I am thankful",

    "text": "It has been years since I have had access to a bagel shop. When I was in Miami, I lived next to a great Jewish Bagel shop that made great bagel sandwiches that I would hit up all the time. But after moving to WV, I learned to make my own bagels, which were good but not quite up to par with the pros yet.  So seeing this place so close to home was nice. I stopped in for a bagel sandwich but didn't realize how big and happening this place was on a Sunday afternoon. Fortunately, everyone was waiting for a table for Brunch, so I was able to make an order for take out right away at the deli.   The deli is packed with all sorts of goodies that send my mind into a diabetic coma. Chocolate fudge cake, black forest cake, NY cheesecake, Babka, rugelach, all forms of cookies, bagels, cream cheeses and deli meats. My mouth watered just thinking about it. :)  I ordered a toasted poppy seed bagel with eggs, cheddar cheese, and pastrami - plus a slice of chocolate fudge cake. One thing I figured out was they go big here. The slice of cake felt more like the whole cake, and the bagel was very big - I like that a lot.  Once I got home and digged into it, I was pretty pleased with it. Bagel was nicely toasted, and made for a good sandwich. The chocolate fudge cake is everything you would expect it to be - chocolaty and fudgy, lol. It is very large, and could easily have been cut into 3 slices that each would have been considered big.   While it is not quite as good as my old place, it is good enough to warrant me coming back. :)",

I always get orders to go, and the guys behind the counter simply aren't friendly, and the girls at the cashier are equally drab and uninviting.  Funny thing about Jewish deli's....it's the one type of restaurant that I'm willing to tolerate attitude from the servers and staff, that sort of New York attitude where they might seem to be rude but really aren't, it's just their style.  And the reason most tolerate it also is because the food is so good it doesn't matter.  However, this isn't the case here. The staff has a terrible unfriendly attitude, and guess what...the food is NOT in fact good enough to justify it. This is no Nate n Al's, or Brent's, two outstanding LA favorites.  This place is marginal at best, and it's amazing to me they are the only deli on the entire West side. Now, maybe Cantor's will change things, but from what I hear of their prices, probably not.  So for now I remain a sad deli fan, sad that the only semi reasonably priced deli anywhere near me treats me like an unwelcome stranger, and in exchange I get food that the people in LA, not to mention NYC, would laugh at.",

Our server argued over something trivial with us instead of just saying, \" Ok, let me get you a new one.\"  ( It was a cream cheese issue) We asked for the fan over our table to be turned off three separate times as it was freezing in there. Each time we were told ok. If you can't do it, just tell me instead of irritating me with an affirmative response.  We will give it one more shot as everyone deserves a second chance. I know from experience that all people and places have their off days. As for the food, he had a bagel and I had pancakes (due to oral surgery, I can't really chew yet). He was pleased with his bagel, was almost as good as back home (NJ). My pancakes we're amazingly good for a NY style deli place!! We can't wait to try some of the desserts we saw while there.",

We always get a bowl of the chicken matzo ball soup because it comes with a bagel. The chicken matzo ball soup is also the best in town! It is packed with so much chicken and is perfectly seasoned and the broth is not oily.  Service is nice and fast. I also like placing an order for take out at the counter and looking through the pastry selection... The Rugula is worth giving a try too!   Hot Tip: Apparently, you can't call in an order of matzo ball soup for pick up... You HAVE to come in and order it at the counter....but it doesn't take that long anyways.",

    "text": "I went with two friends on a rainy Friday afternoon for a late lunch. The cafe is located in an unsuspecting plaza filled with lots of medical and realtor offices. Parking was decently easy to find. Even though we got there around 1, there was still a 20ish minute wait for a table. While you wait, you can look at all the desserts and bagels they have on display. You have the option of dining in or taking out.  Their menus are already at the table and are fashioned after newspapers. I thought it was extremely adorable.  I ordered the homemade matzoh ball soup and toasted asiago bagel with scallion cream cheese. I must pat myself on the back because that bagel/cream cheese combo was so bomb. The bagel had just the right density and springiness to it with every bite. It's no wonder they're called Bagel Cafe. I also snuck a bite of my friend's everything bagel with nova cream cheese and plain bagel with blueberry cream cheese. The nova cream cheese was awesome, and I definitely wouldn't mind paying the extra dollar for it. This was my first time trying any kind of matzoh ball soup, and I enjoyed it enough. It's basically a glorified chicken soup--it got better with every bite.  Given that I have been nonstop complimenting their food, why the three stars then? The service was atrocious. The busboy delivered us our waters right away, but after that, it took forever for the waitress to actually take our order. I actually noticed two tables who were seated after us got their orders taken first and some of their food delivered before us. We had come at the tail end of lunch, and the crowd was dying down. There was absolutely no excuse for the waitress to ignore our table like that. The busboy actually stopped by and asked if our orders had been taken/told us that he'd get the waitress for us. She never apologized for ignoring us/being slow, but she was very fast at giving us our bill.   I will very likely be back for their bagels, but I am wary of dining in again.  4 stars -2 stars for the awful waitress +1 star for the busboy",

They were busy so I understood why my order sat on the counter for several minutes. What I don't understand is why after the tall, thin woman, with short hair bag everything up and then set it aside and not call the name on the bill, like she had done with everyone else. After another five minutes of my order sitting on the side, I went to ask about my order, she didn't even let me finish my question before telling me that the guy will bring it up when he's filled it. The guy that helped me had taken and filled several other orders after mine. I pointed out that the order on the side was mine and she had no choice but to cash me out. She never made eye contact with me the entire time I was there even when I was talking to her. This isn't the first time it's happened but it will be the last.

However, I do feel like with a name like Bagel Cafe, you could have more options for jams for your bagels other than just Smuckers. With all the things they make from scratch here, you'd think they would have time to make their own jam, or at least have something fancier to offer those who want jam on their bagel. They go through the hard work to make their bagels from scratch and even offer boiled bagels, but only Smuckers jam to go with it? They do offer some excellent cream cheeses, however, but I have been avoiding dairy, so they are not enticing to me. Really want a good non dairy option to spread on my bagel and I do not believe they offer anything... besides Smuckers.",

With 25 mins to kill, we jumped in the deli line for some to go for the kiddos. Line moved quickly. They had an amazing array of spreads. Ordered our bagels to go and spreads. Bakery section cannot be missed. Everything there looked great. Our name was called as we wrapped up deli payment. Our server Elaina was excellent. She was friendly and very helpful with menu options. My coffee was continuously filled throughout breakfast. Orange juice was fresh. We were very happy with our order (thank you Elaina).

Ok then let's do eggs Benedict. What a massive fail! The ham was tough, the English muffin was so hard even smothered in hollandaise i couldn't cut it. The plate was a mess with hollandaise slopped all over. Take time to clean the edges.  My husband ate half of his but wasn't happy with the quality either. When the waitress came to check on us I told her and she offered to get something else but by now I was over the whole experience.  Manager came to apologize and make it good, I told him when an item is on the special offerings it should not be sold out by 9:30am.  He then comes back telling me the cook made more corned beef hash if I want any. Hmm... No, I'm done.  A for effort but no thank you  My meal was taken off however, the check still was $20.51 For one meal and two coffees. The coffee is horrible too by the way.  Will I be back?? Most likely not. I'll go to egg works in my neighborhood instead.",

    "text": "Bagal Cafe is a slice of East Coast here in Vegas. The food is great, particularly baked goods (bagels & desserts). I often get an egg sandwich with ham, because the ham is really top-notch. I've never had bad food or bad service here. The staff is always really friendly.  That said, it's pretty loud inside because the kitchen isn't enclosed, which makes for a slighly uncomfortable eating situations at busy periods. So if the back area is open, that's the place to sit - it's much quieter.  But my only REAL complaint is that they have the absolute worst coffee I've ever had in a restaurant. Folgers or some other cheap, instant brand would actually be a step up. Maybe it's the water they use, rather than the coffee. Whatever the case, it's the only flaw in an otherwise great restaurant.",

From the outside, it's in an office complex where I literally drive by always on my way to work. There's ample parking to grab and go for bagels, and among other regular ones if you wanted to dine in --which I just found out when I got inside (so review will be updated as soon as I try their dine in options) Take note: review part 1 is for the grab and go bagels- There were numerous and colorful bagels, all labeled accordingly. You walk to the counter and tell them what you like, they have a variety of cream cheeses, may like 9 of them. My fave is the NOVA (smoked salmon and cream cheese), they go by the ounce and pound. You are able to order by the dozen and get 2 free, and also a bagel to toast and cream cheese to spread.  I took home my brood, with the 2 cream cheeses I chose: Nova and Herb (recommended by the deli-bagel-master)  I toasted some in my new wave, and voilah-- CRAVING SATISFIED.  I suggest that you order a few at a time, I think I was trigger-happy and picked 2 of each. But order if you must, and share them! They have a cute mix of the plain bagel and pampernickel called: The Vegas Golden Knights --so cute!  I shall return, bagel cafe--to dine in.",

Approx 25 to 30 min to scramble eggs and throw meat in  Everything bagel came out burnt, had to send back  Egg scramble came with NO beef tongue and the dumbass waiter insisted he cut the beef tongue personally and sent it to the kitchen himself.  I even showed him the plate while searching for beef with my fork. He copped an attitude, he deserved to be slapped after that. I complained again when the check came He said it was \"only a couple dollars more for the beef\" I wasn't worried about the damn money you asshole. I wish I could remember his name. Some Spanish dude  The asshole GM came and insisted there was tongue in there to a point where I felt insured and belittled. I thought to myself \"bitch, did you cook the food?  Did YOU PUT THE BEEF in?\"  I kind of wish I did speak up but I didn't want to cause a scene.    Management and waiter are confrontational, their eyes don't clearly work well when it comes down to serving food.  They should be working at a taco truck, Not a deli  I will give bagel cafe ONE more try.  If things don't come up to par I WILL cause attention to my table",

I ordered my food over the phone, but still had to wait over 20 mins to get my food and checked out. It is a bit annoying, but it is the price you pay for getting one of the best bagels in town.   Atmosphere: Classic diner. They have cute momentos of NYC as their wall decor. The place is relatively big    Classic NYC deli feel. Its a big smaller than their competitors across town, but it has everything you would need. LOVE the drawings on the wall.   Food:   Bagel with Cream Cheese: 7/10 I LOVE their egg bagel. It is soft and chewy with a nice flavor profile. Their plain cream cheese tend to be on the bland side, so I would go with their flavored cream cheese. They have quite a few for you to choose from.    Bagelwich: 8/10 AMAZING! If you've never tried Muenster cheese in a bagel. DO IT. This place has really good Muenster cheese (much better than Bagel Cafe). The chef is also very accommodating. They can do egg white or regular egg. They will do no oil or light oil if you are trying to be health conscious.   Nova Lox Bagel: 8/10 You get veggies options with this. Cucumber/chives or tomatoe/lettuce. They gave a generous serving of the lox. I enjoyed this sandwich =)  Price: $$. My sandwhich run around $5-$7. Lox was around $15. Feels pretty standard. A little cheaper than Bagel Cafe.   Overall: Recommend! I didn't really care for their regular cream cheese. Other stuff was good! Will be back!",

    "text": "The bagel cafe is busy for a reason. Regardless if you are ordering something for pick up or sitting down for a meal, expect a little bit of wait for a lot of great food.   I have been ordering bagels and desserts from their counter since I was a kiddo. As a kid, this is one of the first places I felt like I was in an actual  \"mom & pop\" bakery. Their cookies and cakes are absolutely amazing, and big portions means that you don't have to get upset about sharing. My family started ordering the coconut cream cake for Christmas Eve, and it is a tradition that will likely be hard to get rid of. This cake is creamy and filling, the type of cake you look forward to on special occasions. This year I messed up and ordered the pineapple upside down cake. No worries, though, the cakes are all rich and perfect for any special occasion.   And the bagels. Of course they are good! I have a hard time indulging on bagels too often, because the carbs just aren't worth it. Here, the carbs are worth it. These New York-Style bagels are a little more hard to come by in Vegas, and their homemade cream cheeses definitely add to the experience.   Finally, if you have some time to sit down for a meal, you won't be disappointed. The servers are always friendly and relatively quick considering how busy they usually are. Fresh squeezed OJ and samples of their bagel crisps and cream cheese will keep you company while you wait for your meal. And I have enjoyed some of the best Vegas breakfasts here of all time. YUM",

Oh, I'm sorry, did that sound like I was complaining--cause I SURE WASN'T!! I had the crab cake eggs benedict--HELLO AMAZING! Combine things I love, eggs, bread, hollandaise sauce, and *drum rolllll* CRAB CAKES--I AM SOLD! I also tried their Spinach Feta bagel with the jalapeno cheddar cream cheese---I thought I was in HEAVEN! Seriously their food is delicious! Huge portions, great prices, and AMAZING service! Their hours are a little odd, but they're in the middle of what looks like a business/corporate area so I assume they're usually open to accomodate the surrounding businesses/offices.   Friends got a variety of sandwiches boy were they HUGE!   I think we'll be coming back here the next time we're in Vegas and want to eat off the strip. Plus they're Bakery/Deli area is AMAZING! I'm TOTALLY getting something the next time I come here!",

From what I understand is this place has been around for quite awhile.  I've been searching for a good bagel place since I got here and I'm so glad I can finally abandon that mission. This place gets packed on the weekends but for good reason. Expect at least a 20 min wait after 10am.  They have at least a dozen style bagels fresh and ready at any given time with a healthy selection of shmears. On top of that, lox, cod and more. And on top of THAT(yes, there's more), is a sweets display. Chinese almond cookies, tiramisu, cinnamon rolls, cakes, so on and so forth. This doesn't include the restaurant which has excellent fresh squeezed oj, pancakes, sandwiches, chicken fried steak, omelettes and a plethora of other dishes. Do I really need to say more? Prices are great. Breakfast never exceeds $40 for two with plenty to take home. Service is fast and friendly. Only thing that sucks is parking is cramped. Literally, every spot is compact car size parking so if you have an SUV, prepare for a tight squeeze.",

Each order comes with one of their bagels and cream cheese too. SO. MUCH. GOOD. FOOD. If you just want to pop in for a pastry, there is an entire counter of delicious goodies, too.",

You'll get a half pound of creme cheese on your bagel, and if you dare to order from the bakery you better have a friend to help you eat whatever you order. The apple turnovers are bigger than an iPad. This place is a legit jewish deli and they take it seriously.   The only other thing to note is that this place is so good its also very very busy. I hardly ever try to eat in the restaurant unless I can get there at the crack of dawn. Better to grab a bagel from the deli and go sit in the park. Parking is tight so avoid coming in a giant vehicle.",

Come here to get your bagel and lox fix, you will not regret it. 2 oz smoked fish  of your choice, we chose (nova), a bagel of your choice for $11.95. My fiance and I chose the everything bagel with scallion cream cheese and nova lox since it's less saltier than the belly lox. Very fresh and meaty smoked salmon with just the right saltiness. It comes as a platter with red onion, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumber and some olives. I loved the cream cheese, it tasted freshly made plus they don't skimp. Of course the bagel was the star of the show. The everything bagel was super plump and airy with the right amount of crisped edges. Flavor rating: 5/5  We also tried the belly lox but we felt that the saltiness was a little bit too much for us. Flavor rating: 3/5  We also ordered a bagel sandwich: jalapeno cheddar bagel with pepper jack cheese, scrambled egg, and bacon for $6. Super simple but the fresh bagel really shines and made everything come together for the perfect bite. The jalapeno and cheddar flavor were equally weak, however the texture of the bagel was great. Flavor rating: 3/5  And for the road we ordered a raisin bagel with cinnamon raisin walnut cream cheese $3.50. They hook it up with the cream cheese so that there is enough to spread equally onto the giant plump bagels. I really loved the cinnamon walnut cream cheese! It's sweet and creamy and went well with the raisin bagel. Flavor rating: 5/5  This place is quite the spot to be at during breakfast and brunch hours so be prepared for a hectic environment. The service is a bit scattered and we were a little bummed that the hostess was clueless on the menu when we asked her a few questions (What was Nova? What are the popular items on the menu?) Hopefully they will have their staff trained up and as enthusiastic about the menu as we are!",

The exterior had a nice crisp, but since the pancakes were so large and dense, the interior was not as pleasant in texture or flavor (imagine somewhat-cooked, mushy, grated potatoes with no seasoning). They looked more like burger patties than pancakes. The sour cream and apple sauce did not help.  Side of Homemade Corned Beef Hash ($6.95). Tasty with a decent crispiness. Definitely one of the better corned beef hash I've had in the valley, though not amazing.  Crab Cake Benedict with Lump Jumbo Crab ($15.95): The crab cake was good and the portion is very generous. Decent hollandaise. The home fries were just okay.  Combination Platter 2: two bagels, two cream cheeses, 9 oz. fish ($33.95). I chose Everything and Egg bagels, Scallion and Olive Pimento cream cheeses, and Nova, Lox, and Smoked Whitefish. Each of the Smoked Fish Platters come with tomato, red onion, cucumber, olives, pickles, and capers. The bagels are great. I got them lightly toasted (the best) and they had great taste and texture. The cream cheeses were also good and I really enjoyed these particular flavors. I did try a bit of the Garlic Cheddar and that one good, though I preferred the other two. The Nova and Lox were great, however, the Whitefish was not as smokey or tender as I'd like. Not a big loss for me since I'm more concerned about the salmon anyway. Lastly, I loved all the fixings! The pickles were great and all the vegetables were fresh and plentiful.  The food was a hit or miss for me. Though I enjoyed the Smoked Fish Platter, everything else was just all right. In addition, service was shoddy. Our server was very nice, however, she rarely came to check on us (we had to flag her or someone else down three times). We didn't receive a single water refill when we began to look around the restaurant and wondered if that was typical. It wasn't; other diners' cups were refilled moments after I saw them empty. Our cups remained empty while we continued to look for someone to assist us.",

We were at our table for more than 15 minutes before a \"bus girl\" with a bad attitude and no name tag walked over and said \"What do you want to drink?\" Not even a hello, welcome, etc. When she brought our drinks she spilled scalding hot coffee on the arm of someone at our table and not even an apology. Completely unbelievable!!  It was another 10+ minutes before our server came to take our order. Quite a long time when the restaurant wasn't even half full. From the time we walked in the door until our food was on our table was 55 minutes. Not acceptable.  I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs platter. It was just okay. I asked for over medium eggs and received soft poached. The fruit cup that was substituted instead of potatoes was 2 chunky pieces of pineapple and 2 chunky pieces of honeydew melon. The bagel and cream cheese was good.   Overall I didn't think it was worth the total of $17.27 + tip.  I'll be happy NOT to spend my money there again.",

The pancake was burnt on the outside and raw in the middle it looked like the griddle was on way to high. Sad thing was that even though the pancake was burnt and kind of black on half of the pancake, literally, they still brought it to the table. We usually love going to the bagel cafe but the past few times it seems like the quality and the service has gone down. Employees of the bagel Cafe have gotten used to the business being very good there and the attitude of the employees have kind of gone down as well. For one thing when you stand in line in the bakery or deli area even though there's multiple people behind the counter talking they take their time to turn around and service the customers which is very bad customer service. I must say that this time and the last time we went there just was not up to the quality of service That the bagel Cafe is usually at.",

We were speachless....or rather, the things coming out of our mouths were not words anymore, just hushed squealing. It was BEAUTIFUL. Fresh baked goods, homemade CREAM CHEESE!!! , to-go items, cold cuts, pastries, you name it- the display itself is worth the trip (boop failed her arms like a 5-year old in a candy shop for a solid 5 minutes). Once we regained our composure we seated ourself. 11 am on a Thursday morning, it was already packed.   Busboys were quick to give us water and silverware, then someone brought us over their complementary cream cheese of the month with some bagle chips (the pesto flavor is great). After a good look through their newspaper menu's, we ordered. The chicken salad was perfect and came with a side of potato salad (of which boop commented about the potato salad \"this tastes just like my mom's I'm going to cry\" and I swear she really did have tears in her eyes) the portions were huge. Coffee was on point, delicious- not burnt and not too strong.   The bagles here are the  R E A L   D E A L !  Couldn't have asked for a better breakfast, definitely going to make this one of our morning spots.  Next goal: come for dessert !!!",

The cookies are not good, black & white cookie is more like cake and the chocolate chip big cookie is beyond dry I could probably break drywall with it.. but the cakes I've tried are pretty tasty.

I've had them a few times when coworkers brought them in and I loved how fresh & delicious their bagels and cream cheeses were, but never actually went inside.  This most recent time I finally came in for a take out order. I like that the set up is separate for take out orders vs sitting down and dining in. I decided to go with the pepperoni pizza bagel on a garlic bagel. The portion was huge, definitely worth the money. I really liked the flavor of it, but wasn't a huge fan of all the oil which made the bagel itself kinda soggy.   Overall I still think this place is great and would certainly come back again for some take out bagels or to try their dine in options. Such a cute little home towny place!",

I ordered a jalapeno bagel with 2 eggs and bacon. 7 bucks and it was great.   I encourage anyone to check it out. Be prepared to wait as its extremely popular. In my opinion, its the best breakfast place in Summerlin. Also a full lunch and dinner menu which i have not yet tried.",

First time it was delicious, less than week later ordered same EXACT platter and it tasted like someone dumped entire container of salt on the ENTIRE platter, absolutely disgusting! I called to complain and the rude manager didn't care.. kept saying the lox I ordered is the salty one... didn't even acknowledge that I told him everything on the platter was salty even the olives and tomatoes, didn't acknowledge that I mentioned that I ordered less than a week ago and no excuse for the inconsistency.. he was so rude and didn't care one bit!   I'll take my business elsewhere. We would have been regulars if their was consistency in their food and decent customer service when a problem arises.   After reading restaurants reply below: Again, I explained to the manager that I ordered the SAME EXACT PLATTER twice in a week & have receipts on grub hub showing identical order, I ever offered to show them...yet you cannot even acknowledge the severe inconsistency in your foods from one day to the next instead you insult me and say I used profanity and blame me for the item I ordered . Yes, I ordered the belly lox, both times...so in that case why was the first platter not salty? Horrible customer service any other establishment would have refunded or sent new item!",

    "text": "When you think it's just a bagel place but it's so much more!!  I'm so glad we decided to have brunch here!!  Although I've never been to the East coast I feel this place would fit right in!  I love all the freshly baked breads and desserts that they have.  I also love that you can order deli style or sit in the restaurant.  Now me and the bestie had decided to have brunch before starting our day.  When we arrived at the cafe at first I was like hmmmmm this looks like a business complex, which it was.  I was a bit envious of these people because they got to eat here everyday.  So we entered the cafe and were sat at a table quite quickly.  Surprisingly as busy as they were our drink order was taken very quickly.  We checked over the menu and anytime I come to a new place it's always hard for me to choose or go with favorites or with what the regulars get.  Because well you just never know. So anytime I want to gage a new place I always get something that is easy and simple.  I only do this because I want to see how a place makes the easiest thing on their menu.  So I got the typical everyday breakfast of bacon and eggs along with a bagel and cream cheese.  Let me tell you the food is amazing and the bagels are huge!  The bacon was just how I like it, nice and crispy and the eggs were wonderful.  Not runny or undercooked.  I really enjoyed my breakfast and without a doubt one of the best I've had. Now onto the bakery!!!  Now I'm always a sucker for a good and delicious baked good and this cafe does not disappoint.  There are tons of items to choose from.  Now had I not had to travel on a plane I would have bought a few loaves of bread both regular and sweet and some cinnamon rolls, but unfortunately I don't trust my food to anyone else so maybe next time.  So I settled for a couple of Black & White cookies, which are my second favorite to chocolate chip.  Let me tell you those cookies didn't last till my trip home because I just couldn't.   All in all I'd say I would definitely make the trip back here the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Let me start out by saying that the nova cream cheese is no joke. Absolutely delicious. And the bagel is on point.  I've had the sandwiches here before and they're damn good too but pricey.  I'm  very disappointed with their \"omelet\" however.  When I think of an omelet I think of ingredients bound together by egg.  Apparently their definition is different.   I got the Ruben omelet expecting to have meat and sauerkraut and cheese throughout the omelet.  What I got instead was a Ruben sandwich with an egg wrap.  That's right. An egg wrap.  With the cheese on top.  I was extremely disappointed. I ended up just eating the meat.  Everything should have been mixed together with the egg.  And for the price is was absolutely not worth it.  The bagel and nova cream cheese were delicious which is the only saving grace.  I'm never getting an omelet here again!",

    "text": "What a welcome retreat just a quick drive from the craziness of the strip.  Desperate for anything not in a casino, I went twice this past week for breakfast and both times it was excellent.  Very busy spot with an excellent waitstaff that greets you warmly and gets the coffee flowing while you consider breakfast options.  The menu is pretty extensive with many great sounding options.  On my first visit I went with a corned beef hash omelette (which is not on the menu but they were able to whip it up for me) and even though I am always hesitant to order a bagel anywhere that is not Long Island, this place had me feeling good so I went for it - everything toasted with scallion cream cheese.  Excellent all around - everything fresh and prepared to order.   Came back later in the week needing another escape from the glitter and noise.  This time I was heading to the Red Rock Conservation area for a hike and needed some fuel.  This is on the way if you are coming from the Vegas strip area, but I would have come even if it weren't.  This time I went veggie omelette and a salt bagel with cream cheese and bacon.  Once again, excellent all around - great food, great service and just an excellent overall experience.   While Vegas is not on my favorites list, so glad I found a spot to get away when business calls me there.    As someone who never thought you could get a great bagel off Long Island, Vegas is probably the last place on earth I would have expected to prove me wrong!",

Which is fine, just a little different than I normally have. Someone else got pancakes, which they did not finish, and another had pastrami which split with a Knish.  On the whole it was fine. We stopped by the bakery and got some macaroons. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Just the way I like them.",

Its $5 a glass but its freshly squeezed and incredibly good. I had three eggs over easy with sausage..asiago bagel and a side of citrus fruit. Delicious. Wife had two scrambled eggs..crispy bacon and a sesame bagel with cream cheese. Loved it. My son had the \"everything\" bagel and enjoyed very much. There are tons of choices of pastries....never have seen such a selection. The place is clean..well lit....a little crowded and a little noisy. Our server Rachel was always there when we needed her. Who says you can't get excited over breakfast?",

    "text": "Best Bagel of 2016!  Not even close, this place is #1.  I am obsessed with bagels.  When I am preparing for a trip anywhere, one of the first things I do is try to figure out where I'm going to get my morning bagel fix.  I don't eat bagels everyday, but I need to know where to score if I need a hit.  A toasted Everything bagel with a nice schmear of regular cream cheese and a cafe latte is just about my all time favorite on-the-go breakfast.  No breakfast burritos for me, thank you very much.    The Everything bagels here are the best I've had all year.  Absolutely delicious and wonderfully chewy, they are as good as it gets.    While they clearly know how to make bagels here, toasting them is another thing.  The seeds and other toppings on the top of the bagel were burnt.  Under the cream cheese, the inside of the bagel didn't appear to be toasted at all.  Should be the other way around, minus the burnt.  It was still delicious a delicious bagel, so I'm not deducting any stars. But it sure would be nice if they could address the toasting issue.  At home it's just a matter of switching the setting on the toaster oven from Toast to Broil: the insides get toasted and the seeds/nuts/onions don't turn an unappetizing black.  Surely there's got to be a way a restaurant can toast their bagels without burning the toppings.  The cafe latte here was also excellent, even though it was served at about 1,500 degrees F.  Watch out, McDonald's!  Parking is a huge issue here.  There are some 10-15 minute parking places right next to the restaurant, and if you are taking your order to go , that's fine.  If you are planning on sitting down, you're going to have to scramble for a parking place in the medical center's very crowded private parking lot.  This place is totally legit!  I'm definitely looking forward to trying some of the other things on the menu.    Mikey C says: thank you, Yelp friends!  thank you, Bagel Cafe!",

One word can describe it all ~ scrumptious the pastrami was outstanding. The matzoh ball soup had large chunks of chicken ~ it was homemade with huge matzohs and just delicious tasting. The rhubarb/strawberry pie was delightful. Usually not a fan of pie but this was divine. Highly recommended",

Waited five minutes finally one of the girls came over and said \"For two?\". That was it!!! She seated us and said your server will be right with you. Great! Thanks for making me feel welcomed. To be honest the girls behind the counter look miserable. They need to cheer up or look for another job. Thankfully Elaina came to the rescue. She was amazing! She made my experience worth coming back. At least you have an employee that actually wants and acts like she wants to be there. Don't forget you're on stage!

I'm not a big fan of cured meats, so I tend to shy away from the sandwiches. I usually order the french toast or matzo ball soup (minus the noodles).   Everything here is pretty good. I love me some bagels and this place has a plethora to choose from. Every flavor you can imagine.  The desserts look really good, and if the meal portions weren't so plentiful I'd actually be able to consume one after my meal... lol.  Definitely a safe \"go to\" restaurant.",

Reading some of the negative reviews, I have to laugh. Of course the turkey wrap was only so-so, you dolt, you don't order a hamburger at a sushi place and expect it to be good, do you? And the food has TOO MUCH MEAT? Please, here is $20, go screw yourself. Please.   Stick to the Jewish food--corned beef, matzo ball soup, hard salami, bagels etc etc--and you'll remain impressed.   They always have some funky specials and I've tried them now and again, but the regular menu has so many things I like that I don't mess around too much.   I try every chance I get to stop at this place. I live nowhere near it but anytime I'm even close to nearby, I'm stopping in for a meal or carry out.   The pasties are great and the variety is always appreciated.   Tip for you goyim--order a side of old and new dill pickles. They are both great.",

    "text": "I figured since I learned I need to get my wisdom teeth pulled late this afternoon, I may as well get my grub on considering I will be food deprived for some time.  Best believe this afternoon I will be back for round two somewhere.  Although, known for their kosher offerings, I figured I could get some lox on one of the final weeks of lent Fridays.  So I opted for none other than...the waitresses recommendation on the best breakfast.  I believe the waitresses name is Nancy and was very sweet and sociable.  However, she did remind me of the sister of a co worker who is also very sweet, yet, a little broke down, not body odor conscious and has had a streak of bad luck.  Luckily, I try not to make a correlation with negativity, but it was hard not to notice the resemblance.    Needless to say, Nancy recommended the crab cake benedict, and if y'all have read my previous reviews in the past, I have been known to have a soft place in my heart for benedict style breakfasts.    The dish came out in a timely manner and commenced the destruction of the meal.  The dish came with two crab cake benedicts that were good portions, not too small, not gigantoid.  The dish was accompanied with a side of country style potatoes that were yummy as well.  This is the Friday before Good Friday and my no meat lent restrictions are nearly complete.    The benedicts were filled with an above average crab cake, composed of real crab meat, how do I know you ask?  Well if you hit an occasional bit of shell, chances are the mofo is authentic.  The chunks were a generous size as well.  Holandaise sauce was good to go, not overwhelming or invisible, just right.  The price is the other indicator that the crab meat was real and not faux.  Priced at $14ish, the dish better have included real crab meat, right?!  Not quite as good as Maryland Crab Shack, which I still have a discount coupon for, but a close runner up.  Following the meal, my patnah and I notice that one of our \"indirect\" bosses showed up and my homie began to slide under the table.  I see nothing wrong with staying nutritionally adequate to perform our work duties and was tryna holla at him, yet with his stunnas on, it appeared that he was tryna keep it on the low pro.    Anyhow, I later learned that you are not supposed to eat six hours prior to getting oral surgery, so if I choke on the crab cakes coming back out, nancy is my coworker reincarnated to punish me for my comments about her in this review.",

It was a Saturday and pretty busy, but we only had to wait like 5 minutes.   Jessie and I looked over the menu. I knew that whatever I ordered I wanted a garlic bagel to be involved. Bagel Cafe's menu is huge and everything is tasty. After much back and forth I decided on the shrimp salad sandwich on a garlic bagel and a side of potato salad. Jessie choose the tuna salad on an everything bagel with a side of pasta salad. I also ordered an ice coffee! It was huge, but seriously watered down. I was so happy when our food came cause I was so hungry. My sandwich was piled high with huge shrimp, lettuce, tomato, and red onion. Yummy! It was heaven in my mouth. The shrimp melded so well with that soft garlic bagel. Tasty! It came with my favorite kind of pickle, the half done dill pickle! (Swoon) I didn't really care for their potato salad which I remember being good. I think I've been spoiled by Weiss's potato salad. Jessie also gobbled up her tuna sandwich. I was so glad she liked it.   The service was good considering how busy it was. I love that their dining room is large and you can even just hit up the deli and take whatever you want home.   I always love Bagel Cafe. The food is beyond wonderful. You may think the prices are a little high, but for the quality and portion size it's so, so worth it. If you've never been go now, right now!!",

Sadly, 14 years ago we moved to Cali and we haven't been back to the bagel Cafe since. On our trip back to Vegas this week we made the drive from the strip so I could eat here again and see if it lived up to my fond memories.  It smelled the same upon entering had the same great, friendly service and as always it was busy but they never rush you. This is the best deli I have been to (sorry NY spots).  This visit I had a meat combo sandwich of corned beef and pastrami on rye.  Just as I remember it!  Perfection!  Yum house made pickle on the side and cole slaw that is somehow not too sweet, has great flavor and not dry like every other deli out there.  My family members each had breakfast items which made me remember how insane I was for their bagels!  We ended up at the deli counter on our way out for bagels and cream cheese to go so I could bring them back to Cali with me.  They were kind enough to give me a bag of ice to keep the cream cheese cold on our drive back.  Can you tell how much I love Bagel Cafe?  Yum!!!",

    "text": "4-stars!  The Bagel Cafe is probably one of the only places in Las Vegas that comes close to being an authentic NY type deli eatery.  Must be, because this place is constantly packed full of folks!  East coast natives abound, I hear that 'Noo Yawkeh' accent on every other table!  Works for me!  As long as the food is good.  For what it's worth, The Bagel Cafe doesn't disappoint.  Matzo ball soup?  Get outa hea!  Bagels and lox?  Ahrite ahready!  Hand-cut deli sandwich with pickles?  Fawget aboutit!  All represented here plus much more!  I can't believe I've lived here so long and within a 10 minute drive from this place, should've been here sooner to eat!  Now we will probably visit on a monthly basis whenever the need comes for a big @$$ deli sandwich.  The Bagel Cafe is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner on most days, but you will see that breakfast and lunch are their busiest times.  Want to eat there on the weekend for brunch?  Be careful of the time, the wait can be a bit long!  But if you're looking for good deli eats, the wait is worth it.  They're friendly, but they work quick!  You gotta be on your toes.  Don't give an attitude, because you just might get one back!  These New Yorkers don't take no $hi+!  Keep that in mind and you'll be fine.  The breakfast/lunch crowd is gigantic but there are a lot of open spaces, except for maybe ONE.  Word is power couple Mayor Goodman and former mayor...ahem...Mayor Goodman, frequent The Bagel Cafe often and even have their own empty table waiting for them.  They must really like the place to have their own little spot!  Lucky.  Guess the rest of us non-mayors just have to wait like everyone else.  Food overall looks delicious though and many reviews confirm this.  Pancakes and challah French toast are huge.  Potato pancakes and Eggs Benedict look fresh and hearty.  Omelets, damn they are pretty good in size.  As much as I love breakfast though, I go straight for the deli sandwiches.  Go big or go home!  Most sandwiches come in either the 1/4 pound size (for you little babies), or 1/2 pound size (for us big babies).  They all come with pickles, and your choice of potato salad, macaroni salad, pasta salad, coleslaw, or chips.  Some good eats-a-comin'!  I enjoy building my own sandwich, and often end up with a 1/2 pound behemoth of corned beef and pastrami on rye.  No wheat for me folks!  Give me that sucker, spread on some yellow mustard or the house brown mustard, and I'm ready to go!  I'll pound that 1/2 pound till she is no more!  Luckily there's not too much bread to get in your way of succulent meat.  The Thurmann's meats they use at The Bagel Cafe are of great quality, the seasoning for me on the corned beef and pastrami are just right.  Bright, briny, and peppery.  Damn delicious.  Now, sandwiches are not allowed to be shared at The Bagel Cafe (watch out they will charge you for sharing that), so they have a build your own sandwich platter made for TWO people (or one lucky piggy).  For the sandwich platter you get your choice of bread, choice of two sides, a slew of fresh pickled veggies, lettuce, tomato, onion, choice of cheese, and just over 1/2 pound of up to three deli meats!  Sandwich platter of epic proportions!  Last time around the wifey and I chose corned beef, pastrami, and roast beef.  Yep, we overdid it just a tad.  So much food!  Best part?  This platter comes in at under $20!  We had enough to feed the two of us, plus share a bunch of deli cuts with the kids!  You can choose whatever deli meats you like on the menu, I hear the roast turkey and the tongue (yes - unctuous beef tongue) are good choices as well.  The Bagel Cafe also does authentic deli dinners - classic choices like lamb shank, stuffed cabbage, liver and onions, and chopped steak.  I will have to be back for dinner one day!  For now, I am more than happy with a fatty deli sandwich.  If you can't dine in, The Bagel Cafe will gladly do take-out, they have a full service bakery and deli on the opposite side of the dining room.  Need a dozen bagels for home, or a large side of NY cheesecake?  All this can be had and more, no big wait.    Get some chutzpah and bring your butts over here to The Bagel Cafe!  Don't be a friggin' putz!  I will be back!",

It's kinda a hole in the wall. You can almost miss the location if you're not familiar with the area.   The bagel chips are complimentary, and served when you are seated.

    "text": "First, the ambience gets a big fat ZERO for noise, cramped and dirty.  To begin, it is a huge menu so we needed a bit of time to study it, so we ordered coffees.  I have no idea what the muddy water in the cup was and no amount of cream or sugar could help, YUK!  Oh well, I'm a coffee snob I guess.  My husband ordered a tuna melt on marble rye and he ate most of it.  That said, he didn't touch his fries....I thought maybe he was having a stroke!  Greasy!!  I had the tasteless shrimp salad and had them put it in a wrap.  Someone clearly doesn't realize it's the folding of the wrap that holds the contents in and cut the bottom off, so I removed the wrap to eat it after it fell out all over my plate.  No flavor, none.  I'm also a pickle lover and wouldn't call this a pickle.  I grew up on homemade pickles.  How can you ruin a pickle??  Hubby agreed.  The small side of cole slaw was edible.  That's $40 I'm not getting back, but lesson learned.  To be fair, I asked a few patrons who were leaving if this was a regular spot for them.  To my surprise, they all said they come for the soup only!  I think my last point of distaste was the servers wiping loads of crumbs onto the chairs from the previous patrons.  Yeah, no, I don't want to sit on or step on filth and napkins under my feet.",

    "text": "Items Selected: Coffee Vanilla Crumb Cake Blackberry Muffin Cinnamon Roll Black & White Cookie Buttermilk Pancakes Malted Waffle with Strawberries and Jam Challah French Toast Cheese Blintzes with Sourcream and Jam Corned Beef Hash with Overeasy Eggs and Everything Bagel  Only visited once in the past, but a place to which several others have been referred when craving a good local deli, it was in reminiscing of Langer's a week prior that breakfast was enjoyed at The Bagel Cafe, certainly not the landmark sort of place found in Los Angeles but a very good meal at a fair price just the same.  Laid out with a grab n' go area, bakery, and deli near the door as a spacious but tightly packed dining room fills the rear it was just after 8am on a Friday that our party of five entered and with family getting seated while I perused the pastry case it was mere moments before the menu was navigated; orders placed and rather weak coffee poured.  Perhaps the youngest people in the place, my 60+ year old mother included, it was not long before pastry selections arrived tableside, the daily muffin and huge slice of crumb cake each buttery soft  while a warm cinnamon roll was unfortunately a bit overbaked, the black and white cookie fluffy and thick although frosting tasted a bit artificial.  Moving onward to mains, the kitchen expediting orders at breakneck pace with  the dining room 2/3 full, it was with faux-Maple syrup cast aside in favor of the real stuff from home that French Toast, Pancakes and Waffles were gilded, the last a flavorless disaster when compared to the textbook alternatives; the the hash simply not my style and the blitzes failing to live up to the high standards set by Langer's and innumerable others.      Slipping a bit since my first visit, perhaps an effect of such a large crowd or perhaps a result of me overrating the place based on excellent ordering the first time around, The Bagel Cafe remains a competent spot for those craving Deli foods or what is still, in my view, the best bagel in Sin City.",

The matzo ball soup (better than the version at Weiss) and thick-ass pastrami sandwiches are also pretty great.   2 ounce lox plate with a spinach and feta bagel and cheddar-garlic cream cheese: not a combo I'd normally opt for, but somehow it all really worked together- the fish was fresh and silky and plentiful, the bagel toasty and chewy, the schmear chunky with cheese and fragrant with garlic. Everything was plated beautifully too, a leaf of lettuce under all of the thick slices of tomato and red onion, a russian pickle, several slices of cucumber, and a handful of olives, too.  I peeked in the pastry case \"just for a look\"- and walked out with a \"small\" black and white, that was easily the size of my hand. Great cookie, overly sweet frosting. My BF samples a different cake each visit and hasn't yet found anything he dislikes.  ETA: Pizza bagels (particularly the fresh spinach and feta) are divine, especially on the garlic bagel;  the tongue sandwich is also light and silky and delicious.",

    "text": "My Jewish family and I loveeee The Bagel Cafe. We dine in occasionally, but usually get stuff to go. They have a huge assortment of bagels and cream cheeses, as well as deli salads, fish, cold cuts, and some amazing desserts for purchase. The bagels are my favorite. They are soft and baked in house with over a dozen flavors. They are extra delicious if you can get them fresh out of the oven. We usually get a baker's dozen, which is 13 bagels, and a flavored cream cheese, as well as egg and tuna salads. This makes for a yummy brunch.   My last visit was on a Sunday around 1 and I was in and out quickly. You order at the deli counter, and then pay at the register. For a dozen bagels, 1 pound of lox cream cheese, a pound of tuna salad, and half a pound of egg salad I spent $40. A bit pricey, but definitely worth it. You get what you pay for, and you are paying for quality food. Whenever anyone suggests bagels, this is the place we always go to.   I recommend not coming early on weekends if you can help it, because they are jam packed and there is always a line. They are open during the week until 8pm and until 5pm on weekends.",

    "text": "We FINALLY made it to The Bagel Cafe in search of a breakfast spot we had never been to. Why the heck did it take us so long!?!?!? Better late than never, right?  This place was packed when we stepped inside, but luckily for us, a booth was waiting with our name on it which was great because I'm not much of a fan sitting at open tables in the middle of the dining room of a . Talk about selection here!!! People really look like they're reading the Sunday Paper! That's how extensive their menu is...our waitress checked back on three different occasions laughing because we were kinda overwhelmed on deciding what to get.  I knew I wanted a bagel, and it'll almost always be an Everything Bagel with Nova Spread.  Wifey wanted a cup of their popular Matzo Ball soup(which was also a first for me, I think) and the Challah French Toast. Along with my bagel, I had to have a Potato Pancake with sour cream and apple sauce, and I've never had a Knish, so I added one of their meat and potato ones. The Matzo Ball Soup was very good, and my bagel was as I imagined-nicely toasted and chewy like a NY bagel. The Nova spread was pretty bomb too. The Potato Pancake was simple, straightforward, and delicious. Something in the flavor of the Knish was kinda foreign to me, and after 2-3 bites, I was done with that...At least I didn't knock it before I tried it! Wifey also failed to read that the soup came with a bagel, so she chose a Cinnamon-Raisin Bagel with cinnamon-raisin cream cheese which we enjoyed. The French Toast arrived and this plate looked like it came from Hash House A Go-Go!?  Bigger doesn't necessarily mean better IMO....all I could taste was egg, egg, and more egg. The challah wasn't soaked enough either. A little cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla extract does wonders! Overall, it was a great first visit. Tasty food, great service, and a great local spot to start your morning....ALOHA!!!

    "text": "I'd been to the Bagel Cafe before (for, what else, bagels), so I knew they were open for breakfast and lunch. But unlike most delis, they are also open for dinner, so I thought we'd give them a try for takeout. (I've never eaten in the restaurant, although seating is available.)  Like most delis, they offer a huge menu of meats, fish, sandwiches, and pastries. And like most delis, they are pretty expensive. But you get a lot of food for the money, and they offer half portions of their sandwiches if you're not that hungry.  My husband had the combo reuben (a full portion), which was equal parts corned beef and pastrami. Like most deli sandwiches, this was overstuffed with meat. And while the meat was tasty, the abundance of it threw off the ratio of the other ingredients, so you couldn't really taste the sauerkraut and cheese. That said, it was a pretty good sandwich (although I'm not sure if it was $14 good). The reuben was served with fries and a side of too-sweet macaroni salad, both of which were unnecessary and were basically uneaten.  I wasn't as hungry, so I got a spinach knish and a quarter-pound of whitefish salad as a side. Together, this was under $8. The knish was fine; I've had their meat and potato knishes before and thought I'd try the spinach (the others are better). But the whitefish salad was great. It reminded me of the fish dip at Ted Peters Famous Smoked Fish in St. Petersburg, Florida, and I ate it as such: like a spread on crackers (which I had at the house). Not sure if you can eat it this way if you dine in, but I bet you could ask for some crackers and serve yourself up some tasty Vegas fish dip!  Next time, I'll double up on the whitefish and skip the knish. In fact, I'm craving that whitefish now ... See you soon, Bagel Cafe!",

    "text": "The food is typically good, exactly what I would expect from a New York style deli, service on the hand; that's a whole other story and that's the basis for this review.  Over the years I've lived in town, which has been since 1995, I've eaten at this place numerous times. Occasionally service is pretty good but most of the time the service is way off.  Slow and poor. Today was no exception, the restaurant was fairly busy so we didn't mind waiting for a table, however it took an exorbitant long time to get our order taken once we were seated. The food came at a reasonable time but the order wasn't accurate. When we were ready to leave it took forever to finally get the check, we asked three people and sat for over 20 minutes trying to get somebody to get us a check; they wouldn't. We finally got up and waited in line to pay at the counter.  Once we got up to the counter to pay, which is something our waitress should have taken care of, the guy ringing just walked away!!  That leaves one person at the register and a whole extra line of people.     I'm never going back regardless of whether I like the food or not.  The service is so poor for  what you pay there's just no reason to go there anymore.   Plus: I find them to have a horrible attitude towards consumers. Notations on the menu like \"one check per table, no splitting checks\", \"$2 charge for plate splitting\"... Little rules and irritants. On the surface these dont sound like  big deals but when you couple it all with their poor service and their generally snotty attitude...well, screw 'em; I don't need 'em.",

    "text": "I was so excited to come here after having this place bookmarked for a month or so and driving by on a weekly. My boyfriend and I finally came in on a Sunday morning and it was packed! I was so sad because I was starving and anxious for some delicious food. The wait was only about 15-20 minutes and we got to stare at all of the delicious-looking pastries in the mean time.  After being seated, we browsed through the menu (which looks like a newspaper) and it was pretty hard for us to make up our mind. My boyfriend decided to get the chicken-fried steak with eggs, potatoes, and a super egg onion bagel while I got the mushroom and cheese omelet with potatoes and a jalapeno cheese bagel.   His chicken-fried steak was delicious, he said, and the bagel was SO good. I definitely should have ordered that bagel instead because I felt that the jalapeno-cheddar bagel was lacking in flavor. It was still good, especially with their amazing cream cheese on the side, just not super flavorful.  My mushroom and cheese omelet was pretty good, cheesy and mushroomy like you'd expect. The fresh-squeezed orange juice was literally the best orange juice I've ever had in my life. No exaggeration there. It was delicious.   The service was quick and super friendly! After we ate, even though I was so full that I was bursting at the seams, we went to go get pastries. We splurged. We got raspberry, coconut lemon, blueberry, and apple cinnamon rugalach as well as a \"mini\" eclaire, chocolate dipped macaroon, chocolate dipped Florentine, and raspberry linzer tart. We devoured all of those within 2 days of going there. No regrets... Besides not buying the coconut cream cake and almond horseshoe but we're saving those for next time! :D coming back soon!!",

I ordered their Matzo Ball Soup which was pretty good, and my hubby ordered an Everything Bagel with Nova Spread, Potato Pancake, and a Knish which we didn't care for too much. Since the soup came with a bagel, I decided to try a Cinnamon-Raisin Bagel with Cinnamon-Raisin spread which was quite good.  The French Toast was something we had to try after hearing good things, but that too was just so-so. Maybe we'll give the bakery items a try if and when we return.",

I am a sucker for a great omelet...I glanced in that area on the menu and noticed something odd...PASTRAMI as a meat choice!  Let's give it a try :)  Pastrami Meat Omelet ($9.95). I wasn't sure how this combination was going to work out, but I am SO glad it did! Very flavorful pastrami, and everything here was perfect! Love their \"home fries\" aka breakfast potatoes and it comes with a bagel as well!  One of the BEST omelets I've had to date.  All the omelets come with a choice of side...including a Bagel.  I gave the Jalapeno and Cheddar bagel with Jalapeno Cream Cheese a whirl. So good!  A lot of the flavor was in the cream cheese...love how they pair em up!  I also grabbed some goodies from the bakery side....give the ITALIAN COOKIES a shot if you want a super rich, thick chocolaty cake like dessert.  Not sure why it's called cookies, but I am not complaining on taste!  Pics :",

I ordered the brisket with a potato pancake and it also came with soup or a salad and a dessert. . The price was really good especially for the portions . I had enough brisket to last me a couple of meals! It was cooked to perfection in my book . There was a little red which is good for me. Brisket was juicy and tender. I chose the soup of the day instead of the salad. I loved that the soup came with a big meatball in it.... (I'm a carnivore). Everything was delicious. I want to go back and check out their bakery section though. They had huge slices of coconut cake, strawberry shortcake...bagels of many flavors. I've been to much hyped about delis and it doesn't compare to the quality you are getting here. Thanks to the Bagel Cafe I know what a real deli is supposed to be like!",

Because The Bagel Cafe is my heaven, my trigger, and my ultimate guilty pleasure.  The bagels are PERFECT and the spreads, (both of which have many varieties) are the best texture and flavor you can find this side of New York. Not that I've ever experienced a NY Bagel, but if I HAD, I am sure this statement is True...if only to me.  I also have to add that they have THE BEST selection of bakery items. LARGE cookies and muffins, as well as decadent cakes. Oh man, someone needs to hold me back because I think I need to head over now and get some sweets \"for the office\".   I really need to remember on my next visit to photograph my order before I inhale it. But in my defense, I believe \"Pictures or it didn't happen.\" In other words, if I don't photograph my food, I negate the calories (I WISH.)  The Bagel Cafe is a great place to run in, grab some bagels and spread or other baked goods to take to your morning office meeting (and make your employees VERY happy). It's also a great place to stop for a sit down meal, whether it's a business meeting or family visiting town.   The dining room is a bit crowded at times (especially on weekends) but the service and the food are well worth it. I've never run into a cranky server or employee. Even when they are bustling, the team is accommodating and friendly.  If you make it to The Bagel Cafe, PLEASE send me a message and tell me your favorite dish.",

The Bagel Cafe has always been and still is one of my favorite breakfast spots whenever we're in this side of town! This place has it all- from their fresh bagels made daily, various cream cheese flavors made from scratch, an amazing abundance of baked goods and pastries, and to their delicious and flavorful dishes. You honestly can't go wrong with whatever you're craving here. In addition, the service here is always on point! Everyone is super friendly and always gives us a warm welcome.   My boyfriend and I came here for brunch today; and as always, this place did not disappoint. Our waitress was very nice and took our order immediately. I ordered the veggie omelet with ham and my boyfriend ordered the ham steak and eggs. We both chose homemade home fries and a bagel with cream cheese with our meal. I always love getting their honey wheat bagel with strawberry cream cheese. My boyfriend chose the garlic bagel with plain cream cheese. We also ordered a single pancake to share since we've always wanted to try their pancakes. The food was made fresh to order and came out fast. We didn't wait long at all. The pancake was light and fluffy, the bagels were yummy and extremely soft, the ham steak was a delicious and thick slab of meat, and the veggie omelette was really good. Btw, the portions are humongous! I barely made a dent in my food and had to ask for a to-go box. Our waitress was very attentive and checked on us frequently to ensure everything was made to our liking. She even brought out two sugar cookies for us since today was Mother's day. It was nice of her. Although we were extremely stuffed and had major food coma, it didn't stop us from picking up some goodies at their bakery to take back home.   Overall, this is a great breakfast spot if you're looking for a delicious meal with impeccable service. I definitely recommend checking this place out!",

    "text": "My rating is based on service alone. The waitress was nice, so that is why I am giving two stars instead of one. I had to wait almost 15 minutes to order, after my waitress disappeared. Considering the location is in a business complex, I would assume many people come here between appointments or on lunch breaks, so ordering in a timely manner would be appreciated by many.   Once my food finally arrived, the Philly cheesesteak has peppers on it even though I ordered it without. It didn't have the side of mayo I ordered either. I did not have time to wait for a new sandwich to be made, so I couldn't have lunch. It seemed odd that such a simple order wasn't fulfilled. I was really looking forward to trying this place because the decorations were cute and I expected a NY restaurant to have good food.",

Their pastries are huge!! So huge you can share with 3-4 people. They have delivery with Grubhub of you're not feeling well for about $4 which of sick is such a convenience.  The bathroom is always clean and well stocked. The to-go section is always busy but the service is pretty quick and professional. Their selection in bagels is quite extensive which I like because I can eat which ever I want.",

I had an a pretty basic omelette bc I wanted to try the breakfast potatoes and a bagel.  My Omelet wasn't impressive but the husband got the Reuben omelette - that was outstanding.  The breakfast potatoes and bagel made up for my tasteless omelette.  I totally get now that you need to go big here.  No playing it safe.  Pancakes we're very good and the chive cream cheese was so fresh.  We saw the French toast come out and that looked killer! The place is crazy busy and very loud.  Service is quick serve expectations but very nice.  We had to ask for table settings and refills but they were fast and nice about our requests.  I think this is going to be a regular stop for us.

    "text": "This was my third visit to the Bagel Cafe. I am a New Yorker so my standards for a deli are pretty high. We arrived at 1 pm on a Friday and luckily only had a five minute wait to be seated. However we were not waited on for quite a while. The menu is extensive, so it is difficult to decide what to order. I settled on the corned beef hash and eggs special with an everything bagel. I am gluten sensitive so I mainly ordered the bagel for my husband to take home. He ordered a burger made with grass fed  beef.   We waited what seemed to be forever for our food. This surprised me because on other occasions we were served faster.  I forgot to take photos of the food because we were so hungry by the time they arrived. My order was well presented with a generous three eggs (I ordered over easy and they were cooked perfectly). The corned beef was cut up with onions and potatoes plus there was a small side of hash browns. They even added a skewer of fruit kabob. The bagel was toasted but not buttered and came with cream cheese with no butter on the side. If I was planning to eat it there I would have complained but it was fine for us. Bottom line, the food was good and the price was right ($10 special).   My husband's burger came with fries and one side and he had coleslaw. He complained to me that the bun was falling apart but the burger was tasty. The fries stood out as some of the best here in Vegas.   We were asked once if we needed anything but once we were done eating we were ignored and had to eventually request our check and take home box. The portions were so large we took home half the burger and my dish (and the bagel).   Food wise, we will come back. Service wise, we will not go there if we have limited time. Bagel wise, certainly not the best but standards are lowered here in the desert.",

Cream cheese flavoRS where traditional veggie, scallion, locks, and a rotating flavor of the month. We had their jalapeno cheddar bagel, asiago bagel, plain bagel, and Sun dried tomato.

My current hometown does not have a bagel spot and so it's either a grocery store or bakery that I have to find bagels at and then all the yummy goodies that go with bagels are non existence with the above options so I'm left with having to concoct my own or just adding some cream cheese, again nothing fancy, just store bought...... meh. Sooooo, when traveling and breakfast is a must, I tend to look for bagel shops and this yummy place popped up on Yelp, so we made our way over. Location is not the best, it was a Saturday so that didn't help but parking was sparse and crowded and once we walked in the place was HUGE! The greeter was super nice and I asked how long it would take to be seated as there was so many people and she advised if we where on a time constraint that we should order at the deli, this was greatly appreciated. This cafe is basically a full fledged restaurant in the rear with an open deli/ bakery in the front and it's a great concept! We where super pleased with our food, LARGE portions and so many options!

Both were very delicious. Reuben was a very nice portion compared to most places in town. Corned beef was flavorful and lean. Only downfall was they wouldn't let us upgrade to a small salad in lieu of the mac salad for a small price. Also, the server told us we couldn't order more broth for our leftover soup to go. Said we had to order another cup of soup?!? Ended up charging us for a bowl to go and only brought us a cup portion. Just charge us a couple bucks for some more broth and be done with it. It's really quite a turn off. Don't alienate your customers by penny pinching. Although we will be back. Probably only for carry out next time.",

    "text": "This was my first time here. When you first walk in the first thing you see are the deli cases, the display cases with the bakery items, and a variety of bagels. They have several different kinds of cream cheese, cakes, pastries, meats, salads, etc. We were told to seat ourselves and a waitress would come to the table. I also noticed there were a few people waiting for take-out at the counter. The menu is huge. It pretty much has everything you would expect at a deli of this size.  I'll go over each item.  Pastrami Ruben: The bread was too greasy from too much butter. The pastrami was definitely not made in house. The sandwich was okay. I probably wouldn't order it again. The fries they serve are pretty awesome though. I definitely like the fries! I also like the cucumber salad they serve on the side. Oh and their deli style pickles are also freakin' awesome!! Great pickles.  Matzo Ball Soup: I never had it before. It was pretty much chicken noodle soup with two dumplings. It was okay, but not something I would order again.  Lox & Bagel: The platter came with the smoked salmon, tomatoes, onion, capers, cream cheese, and bagel. Everything on the platter was excellent except for the bagel. It did not taste like a fresh made bagel. It was more like something from the store. It was not bad, but I was expecting better.  The potato knish and the potato pancake were very good. This was the first time I ever ate a knish. I would probably order it again.  The service was good. Our server was very pleasant. Overall the food was not anything spectacular. Sorry to disappoint all the reviewers who gave them 4 and 5 stars, but I didn't eat anything that made me want to rush back here. It was just okay.",

The most recent time I visited, I got an everything bagel with 2 eggs, bacon, cheddar cheese and avocado. Living in NYC, BEC on a bagel or roll is a typical breakfast here and since the cafe is NYC themed, I figured I couldn't go wrong with that. I found it odd that the server asked how I wanted my eggs since usually they're just served in a patty like form (perfect for eating on the go) in NY. I said over medium was fine. When it was brought to the table, I was surprised that it was served open face. I guess this is so I could add any condiments I wanted to it..? Eating it was a bit messy since the eggs were runny (probably not a good choice; I should choose hard next time). That being said, it was delicious and very satisfying. I also had a mimosa which was delicious and some coffee after that. I redeemed the check-in offer for a free cookie which was really yummy and hit the spot after my meal. I always enjoy my meals here and it's a great choice for brunch; they just need to perfect the art of bagel sandwiches :)",

They also offer meats, bagels and cream cheese spreads to buy in bulk as well.   We got there around 11am on a Sunday so there was about a half hour wait. If you want to get right in I would suggest that you get there earlier.  I was so hungry and ready to eat when we sat down! I decided to get a breakfast sandwich on a jalapeno and cheddar bagel with an over-easy egg. I then added a sausage patty and chive cream cheese to it. Although it didn't look pretty it was amazing! I need to visit again so I can have this or the pizza bagel!  Love having local places like this!",

There aren't many superb salt bagels, I'm talking the good ones with the white granules all over the bagel - not the combination - but the fresh white salt granules! Yum!  This place has it amongst 20 other types of bagels.  There are also a myriad of cream cheeses, some beyond the norm which was a nice option!   Muffins and danishes were fresh and delicious - according to the hubby, he is a fan as well.  Their baked goods and bagels are definitely fresh - no question - and soft!   They are not cheap - we paid $14 for 4 bagels with cream cheese on 3 and butter on one.  I believe there is a \"cut/slice\" fee as well.  However, if you are in the mood for a good, damn good bagel, you will find it here!   Service - we stood in front of the \"order here\" sign for a good 8 minutes before being acknowledged.  There were at least 4 people walking around behind the counter, but I guess we were invisible?  I'm not sure how you missed us - we were a party of 2 adults with 4 little girls in ballet clothes, giggling and starving?!!  Anyway, we left happy and their bagels, muffins and pastries are legit!  And almost . . . . ALMOST worth the wait.",

People working here certainly seem to enjoy their jobs, all were so friendly and accommodating.  After ordering at the table I walked over to the bakery and picked out a scrumbish chocolate babka, again so accommodating, the bakery hostess sliced a nice piece for us to eat at the table and wrapped the rest of the loaf for us to take home.  By the time I returned to my table the slice was there with fresh silverware, napkins, and coffee, when I paid my bill the packaged babka was ready for me.

Now that I have been reminded what a delicious cheesecake this is, I feel I have the strength to write the rest of this review. My friend and I got the strawberry cheesecake for our late-night Netflix girltime dessert fancies, and bagels and cream cheese for the next morning's airport run shenanigans.   I tend to like a more dense, fatty, hilariously-bad-for-you cheesecake, but this one is light and airy and is a-okay for me. The fruit on top is good, but I don't like the red-40 laced syrup they drizzle on top of it. Next time I'll just get the plain because it's a good cheesecake overall.  However, the real winners here are the namesake of the Cafe--the bagelssssss. I got spinach and feta, my friend got the egg bagel with everything on it. Both were good, though after spending the night in the fridge, were nearly impossible to cut. I eventually got them both in the toaster and gobbled all those carbs at 7am (which led me to sleepy time for most of the rest of the day).   All in all a decent place. I want to try it as a restaurant instead of a deli, too. Good thing it's right down the street from my best friends' house so I have an excuse to visit!",

The only think is that I cannot find anything I like beyond the bagels and pastries.  We used to go to the Bagel Cafe every weekend cause it was down the street from my bf's old domicile. I don't know if I am being fussy but I just don't like their omelettes or eggs for that matter. The eggs are always a bit overcooked for me and I really don't like their assembly. The omelette has a slice of cheese slapped on top. And since I am not a fan of bell peppers I do not like their seasoned potatoes. And it seems like every time I go their bacon is undercooked.  So the things I have liked so far are, of course, their bagels. My personal favorite is the sesame, my bf usually likes the asiago. The garlic cheddar cream cheese is good but it is so strong that after a while it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I also like the cheese blintzes, they are very large and full of sweet cheese. Tthe potato pancakes are pretty good as well.  Edit: for clarity",

    "text": "This sandwich and rugulach habit is getting ridiculous. The BF and I have come back several times in such a short span.   The first few times we got breakfast and I highly recommend for eggs benedict fans to get it here. I love hollandaise and they are not skimpy with it, ham actually has flavor, perfect poach eggs. I tried the crab cake version too, and surprised I liked the original better. The corned beef hash was another we tried and I thought it was tasty. I love their potatoes the brekkies come with and the bagels of their name sake actually are quite nice.   Then I decided to try their corned beef sandwich and was prepared to be only mildly satisfied. I have a little Jewish corner of my heart that beats for childhood Saturdays at Langer's. The corned beef was flavorful, juicy and the marbled bread I chose was great. I always eat mine with  coleslaw and Russian dressing (aka thousand island). I'm normally into pickles, but theirs is closer to cucumber than pickle so I'm not the most fond of it. The sandwich was so good, I was a bit sad to  share with the BF and take the other half of the benedict even though I love the bennie.   So we came back several more times to get our own. I have to say that the way to go is the soup and half sandwich deal ($10.95- $11.95). It actually comes out cheaper with more food since the sandwich was just as big as a 1/4th lb, you get soup and can even get a side if you wish for $1. The matzo ball soup here is decent, and the sweet and sour stuffed cabbage was nice though I dropped my phone in it trying to Yelp it. We also tried the lobster salad sandwich and that was solid, but I'm gonna stay with the meat sandwiches..... I should mention I lean towards mostly eating vegetarian and this place is testing it.   Service is pretty decent on checking up. We also don't go during busy times as this is the type of place that gets swamped during regular breakfast/lunch hours on weekends. Beat the busy by heading in a bit later in the afternoon.   While the sandwich and benedict have been stellar, the dessert counter has been extreme highs and lows so much so that I can't justify a 5star.   The best: The rugulach are awesomely good. I normally don't like chocolate ones but I love them here, the almond ones are great, all the fruit ones are great. There is not a bad one so even though it is priced per pound, I feel this is worth it.  The subpar: I'm not fond of the black and white cookie being more like cake. I know a lot of delis do this and I'm just more of a shadortbred person.  The rainbow cookies were okay, but not quite up to my standard with it being too wet though the sponge flavor was right on (those are one of my favorite deli sweets). The homemade twinkie was a bit dry.  The bad: we got a slice of buttercream cake which was painfully sweet with the frosting tasting like boxed. It was thick, sticky and you can feel sugar granules in it with the cake itself also rather sweet. It was a throwaway so I will not be getting anything else but rugulachs. The desserts aren't cheap for what they are...Spent $27 with only the rugulachs being the only thing we are gonna eat the entirety of.   This is great place and I do highly recommend this as a go-to if you're in the area, just know how to navigate the deli and massive menu through recommendations.",

When we finally ate our meal (at home), my friend just kept saying \"oh my god\" and \"are you gunna eat that?\" Cuz he wanted it all!! Las Vegas , enjoy and frequent this business!",

I ordered a Pastrami & Swiss on Rye to go and it was still warm when I got home. I unwrapped the sandwich and it was the same stuffed in the middle item that you would receive in any typical deli - meant to look as if it was really massive. To be expected. I put mustard on it and proceeded to take a bite. It was terribly dry and lacked the wonderful pastrami spice flavor that separates it from a corned beef sandwich. It tasted like the pastrami you can get at any Smith's deli - not REAL pastrami. I opened up the sandwich and noticed it had no fat at all. While excessive fat is a no no, no fat is just as bad. Fat is where a lot of flavor is. The sandwich was so dry that it sucked the moisture out of my mouth. They need to take a look at their purveyor to question the source of their pastrami. I would never purchase another one from The Bagel cafe. Try one and see if you don't agree - if you dare, (unless you are on a fat restricted diet). I really like this place and it distresses me to post this negative review.",

Let me just say I am very hard to please as far as real Jewish food goes.  I usually hate restaurant matzo ball soup but saw someone else order it and it looked great so I ordered it.  It was perfect.  A hearty chicken noodle soup with loads of noodles, chicken chunks, onions and carrots.  The matzo balls were perfect.  Not those typical light fluffy things other delis serve.  A solid 10 out of 10.   The blitzes were the same.  Super perfect and delicious.  10 out of 10.  Potato knish was good, not the best I've had.  Maybe a 7 out of 10.  Sandwiches look amazing but I've never tried one.  They have an amazing bakery too. Had many wonderful things from there.  Cheesecake is an 8, carrot cake is a 9.",

We said that our waitress had done a great job of that. The manager than rudely ran over yelling that the waitress could be fired for that and we should never ask again. I did not realize what a crime it was to ask them to go light on the veggies. Then when we were paying the bill (the manager is also the cashier) he told me that this was the owners wishes. I said the owner was an idiot for not trying to please his customers and the battle escalated from that.

If I'm not mistaken, they make all their bagels, so you knew it was fresh. I'm a big fan of delis, and I REAAAAAAAAAAAALLY wanted the pastrami bagel sandwich, but I went with breakfast. It's another one of those places where you're constantly torn between breakfast or lunch.  I was a little disappointed by the service this time, but normally it's pretty good. I do have to say that I saw my friend's chicken noodle soup. It looks ah-MA-zing. Maybe I will have to get that with the pastrami sandwich. If I can just get past the breakfast portion.",

    "text": "I just found a piece of lox in my refrigerator. I bought here about six weeks ago right before getting ridiculously sick. Instead of grossing me out, the ancient piece of fish just made me want to go back to the Bagel Cafe to restock on fresh stuff.  It's about 35 minutes each way for me to get to Bagel Cafe, which seems like a long way to travel for bagels, but they are without question the best bagels I've had outside of NJ/NY. Having grown up there, I am very particular about bagels. You won't catch me dead in an Einstein. But these bagels are, in a word, fantastic.  They're oversized, big like real New York bagels should be. The crust of the bagel is browned just enough in the baking process, the crumb of the bagels remain chewy and moist.  Another feather in their cap: Bagel Cafe puts a TON of stuff on their bagels. Getting a dozen garlic always results in a massive pile of loose garlic in the bottom of the bag.  As much as I swoon over their bagels (I also really like the onion, asiago and jalapeno cheddar), there's much more here than that. I also like getting a little hand-sliced lox here - while I haven't had anything else from the deli, it all smells OH so good.  As for the dessert case ... I have to plead guilty here. The massive slabs of tiramisu, Napoleons, moist and fragrant macaroons, and ridiculously good (and ridiculously big) muffins, and best of all, rugelach - chocolate, raspberry, apple cinnamon and almond. Score.  A dozen bagels (which is actually 14) is just $10 here, which is sort of insanely cheap. Unfortunately, all the other non-bagel stuff here is so tempting that I wind up easily dropping $30 or more whenever I walk in the door.  But man, is it worth it.",

They have a large selection of fresh bagels made daily with most flavors and styles you can imagine available.  They have a very large dessert case with some very decadent entries.  They also have the good old fashioned big old piled with meat deli sandwich available.  The Pizza Bagel is always enormous and tasty, but its a tall order to finish it alone.  The deli sandwiches are similar, piled high with your choice of various deli meats.  I always liked the cajun spiced turkey breast as well as the classic pastrami, but you really can't go wrong.  If you're from an area that has True delis and are missing it, give The Bagel Cafe a try.  Its the closest thing I found to what I love about visiting NYC.",

The celery and other hunks detract from the smooth smokiness that I crave.  The stuffed cabbage is good, but not as good as Carnegie on The Strip.

Next, no one spoke understandable English. Our server was floundering with the language and three items we requested, they were \" out of\". Server had to actually check to see if they had corned beef & cabbage available. Desert is included with the dinner and is limited to just two items. One is the crumb cake. Server told us they were \"out of\" crumb cake and we would have to settle for the second choice. When we went to pay at the register, the wife saw 4 pieces of crumb cake in the display case. We asked to swap our desert for the crumb cake and the guy at the register said something unintelligible  in a heavy Hispanic accent and gave us just one then told us he cut it in half, otherwise we would have gotten a larger piece. WHAT?? I'm still shaking my head over that one! So now, this NY Deli has all Hispanic staff.  Cooks are Hispanic, as well as waiters and register attendant. Does this now qualify as  Mexican restaurant?",

    "text": "Matzo ball soup! I know the name says bagels, but I when I think of this establishment, I think about this soupy treat. When the craving for it hits, a trip to The Bagel Cafe is a strong call.  On my last trip I had a cup of soup with a garden salad, and of course, it comes with a bagel. Service was sweet, but a little haphazard. I requested an everything bagel, but they were out, so I went with garlic (pretty much the smellier the better for me). Fast forward and a sesame bagel arrives on the table. Apparently, they were also out of garlic, but not really. To make a long story short, I eventually ended up with a garlic bagel, but I was a bit baffled by how someone could think that sesame was an acceptable replacement for garlic. The other troubling thing about bagels here is that they are incapable of toasting a bagel with accessories (such as garlic bits or onions) without burning the little bits. They claim it is impossible, but I don't believe them, and there is nothing quite as unappetizing as burnt garlic. But, I digress.  I am a fan of the matzo ball soup. It has huge chunks of tender chicken, carrots, a delicious ball and a nice balance of seasonings without being overly salty. The cup of soup with a bagel would be enough for a smart-sized lunch. Next time, I would probably skip the salad and avoid getting my bagel toasted. The salad was pretty fresh and tasty, but kind of a hassle to eat and heavy on the black olives. Plus, who needs salad when you've got the matzo?",

The sit down area is hit and miss from what I can tell. The waitresses are all nice, but not ways fast.   Lastly, if you're ever feeling old go here on a Sunday before 9am and you'll feel young again. It seems as if the minimum age is 80.",

I've dined here about 3 times and have stopped in for a bagel or dessert as well. (Jalapeno bagel with jalapeno cheddar cream cheese toasted) And you really can't go wrong with any pastry or dessert. To be honest I've never left without one or four regardless if I dine in. Fav menu selections include: chicken pot pie, crab cake Benedict, and the chicken salad sandwich. Someone in my party had the smoked salmon and it was also great. Grabbed a strawberry rhubarb pie for thanksgiving, again everyone approved. It gets pretty busy, but the staff is on it. If you need something from the deli remember to speak up! This IS an east coast Jewish style place remember. The guys behind the counter are beyond helpful. Bottom line, I'd your in the area, check this place out for lunch or breakfast!",

There was nothing truly remarkable about this place.   EXCEPT... the waitress was noteworthy. She was consistently dropping parts of meals! I watched 2 pieces of bacon slide off the plate when she rounded a corner... and proceed to put it on our table! I even had to call her attention to it, and she needed to be reminded that we needed replacements! Later on she dropped someone's bagel basket completely. Now I know everyone has their days, but this lady was not in good form.   Needless to say, I don't plan on going back. I'd much rather go to the Cracked Egg instead (see my review for it).",

I also like the chili here, and my hubby loves the chicken noodle with matzeball.  The reason I give it only three stars is because every single time I go, they're out of something.  In an effort to not waste food, they only make a certain amount each day.  The problem with doing this is that they are always out of something, and they expect you to change your order to accommodate their currently available items.  I hate this, and it's really frustrating.  Last time I went, they were out of three items before I finally just left.   It's good food when they actually have their menu items.  I suggest going early before the lunch rush to avoid them running out of every other item.",

    "text": "Apparently I'm a glutton for punishment. All your obvious problems aside you do have the best bagels in Vegas. Of course that is only True if you get the bagels you ordered.   Stopped in for a dozen after lunch. Yes I understand it's Sunday but coming from NY I still can't believe that if a place runs out of certain flavors they don't make more. Surprisingly you had pumpernickel. Too bad you gave me a shortchanged dozen everything bagels (I ordered 2). Not surprised. I should know by now that the guys behind the counter can't count. Even if you tell them how many of each bagel. Always short 1 or 3.   So now I really & truly am done with you. No more messed up orders. No more low quality food. No more e-coli from your undercooked frozen burger patties. No more crappy service. No more surly attitudes from counter guys. No more pathetic excuses for a manager.   I guess I'll have bagels & pastrami again next visit to NY.  *Previous Review  I've been going to Bagel Cafe for 18 years since moving to Vegas from NY. We don't have many choices for Jewish deli here and this place has outlasted any and all competition that have opened. On average we would eat Bagel Cafe once a week until about 10 years ago. From then until last year I was taking the kids once a month & doing take-out once a month. Once in a blue moon they might have an off day. Silly things like wilted lettuce or fries that weren't crispy. The bagels and bialys were always perfect. One time they served me an obviously microwaved knish. Hot and mushy on the outside and frozen in the middle.  Recently consistency has become a huge problem. One day the food is perfect and the next not so much.  Last year while dining in the restaurant my son and I both ordered cheeseburgers, well done. Mine was raw in the center. I put everything on my burger, including the fries so I didn't notice until after I bit, chewed and swallowed & thought to myself 'that didn't taste right.' I looked and I kid you not it was raw in the center. Fortunately my son's burger was well done. I had a lovely 2 week bout with e-coli & didn't eat there for almost a year. I also didn't eat a cheeseburger again for almost a year. I didn't hold them 100% responsible as I could have cut my burger in half to check that it was cooked through. Because everyone does that. Right? But seriously though, I cook every day. Sometimes a burger or steak isn't as done as the other ones. It happens. But it isn't rocket science to push on a steak or burger to check if it's done. There is a big difference in feel between raw and well done.  One day the kids were just dying for Bagel Cafe so I took them. I ordered a cobb salad, one kid got a bagel and the other of course ordered a cheeseburger, well done. When he saw my salad he decided that we would share. Fortunately this time I cut the burger in half and it was raw. Now this indicates to me that the 'chefs' don't know what they are doing or the burgers are frozen patties. The manager removed the burger from my bill.  Today we ordered take-out. Very simple order. 1 pastrami & 2 NY knishes. Simplest thing for a deli, well in NY at least. Also I should note that I was asked if I wanted cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion on that. Drove home with the moon roof open & the hot Vegas sun on the bag. Funny thing, the sandwich was cold & the knishes were ice cold. Okay, fine. Threw the knishes in the oven. Attacked the sandwich. Now I know it's pastrami and it's fatty but it should be meat with fat on it. About 1/3 of the sandwich was sliced fat with meat on it. Couldn't even chew it. So apparently now they do not know how to cut the pastrami.  The icing on the cake: They shortchanged me on my dozen bagels. By two. Seriously, now you guys can't count?!?  I'm just done. Good bye Bagel Cafe. If I want deli I'll take a flight back home and go to Katz. It would be worth the time and money for a decent sandwich and a knish that hasn't been nuked.",

By the time our food came they made a mistake we ordered a kids meal and asked for a fruit cup they gave us fries we also ordered a triple meat sandwich did not look like it was triple meat with a cucumber salad they gave us coleslaw we had to tell the server.

There was no greeting when we walked in. We stood by the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign awkwardly until the cashier told us 3 minutes later to seat ourselves. Look, the sign told me otherwise, how was I supposed to know what to do?  Once we sat down, we waited for someone to take our drink orders and to give us menus. Took us a second to realize they have those crappy newspaper menus like Egg Works on the condiment stand. Invest in regular menus please.

Melted Swiss on top with a side of homemade sliced fresh cucumber salad and a dollop of fresh cottage cheese, farm fresh lettuce and tomatoes made it a meal to remember.   Oh, and the service was five star!!  I'll be back soon.",

Get anything with lox here, matzoh ball soup, and you have GOT to make sure you check out their pastry selection. They are to die for. Boston cremes as big as my head! Everything here tastes fresh! So explore ahead without fear~ *Note: DON'T FORGET THE DELI.  My only gripe with this place is every single time I've been here the service is terrible. Been left here waiting for 15-20 min at my table to get my order out...and it's not even busy. And splitting checks is always hard---SO BRING CASH. Regardless, I love the place still...just not enough for a 5 star..4.5 starts please?!",

    "text": "It's no secret that I love sweets.  I was kind of excited to hear that Carlo's (of Cake Boss fame) opened up at the Venetian but with all the bashing they've been getting on their reviews it went lower and lower on my to-do list. Oh well. If they're still there the next go around then it can't be that bad right?  Anyhow I always wanted to try a chocolate babka. Blame it on Seinfeld. That episode left an indelible mark on me because I still think about it to this day. Let's face it, a babka is as foreign to me as a spam musubi would be to a New Yorker. And Bagel Cafe fits my needs perfectly because I'm not planning to go to New York anytime soon.  So my visit to Bagel Cafe is strictly for their bakery/deli side. Those bagels looked pretty darn good. But I was on a mission to get my chocolate babka and thank goodness they still had some. I think I got the second to the last one. I also got a rainbow cookie and chocolate rugulah both sold by the pound.   Chocolate Babka - A loaf of coffee cake filled with chocolate. That loaf must have weighed 3 pounds. I swear. It was heavy. I hand carried this back to Honolulu. I thought it would taste like Hawaiian sweet bread. But nope.  It's a very dense bread that has a wisp of sweetness to it. I gave some away to share and had a nice french toast breakfast with the leftovers.  Rainbow Cookie - So pretty. Layers of almond extract soaked sponge cake layered between chocolate ganache. So, so good. Moist and very sweet. Wish I bought two or three.   Chocolate Rugulah - This chocoholic had to get it. It was delicious. Not overly sweet. Wish I bought two or three.  I can finally lay my babka fascination to rest. I would love to go back again. Maybe try their restaurant side which looks kinda casual and quaint.   TIP: When looking for this place, they are facing N. Buffalo so it's pretty hard to miss. You will see their big signage on their building that kind of look like townhouses.",

We were back for our anniversary and thought we'd head here for breakfast. The food was fine, but the service was really upsetting. The waitress delivered our food and asked my husband if he wanted more coffee and then didn't return until it was time to deliver the check. I observed a young man bringing coffee to all the other tables. He never came to ours. After paying the bill and leaving a tip I wish I hadn't, my husband and I went to the bakery to buy some cookies. I went to the counter and one cashier served another woman ahead of me. I went to the other cashier who was serving someone and once she was done, she literally turned her back on me and started rolling silverware.  I have never received such horrible customer service here. Awful and so disappointing.",

From the other reviews, maybe we got lucky because there was a car pulling out so parking was not a problem. And there were a couple tables open, so there wasn't a wait, plus our service was excellent.  We had a breakfast sandwich, a pastrami sandwich, matzo ball soup, an everything bagel, a sun dried tomato bagel, and the scallion cream cheese. The bakery section looked great and tempting but we were just to full. The bagels and cream cheese were phenomenal, huge and delicious. The pastrami sandwich was so good and big, definitely enough for two, but unfortunately the side potato salad wasn't very good (not a big deal considering everything else). The breakfast sandwich and soup were very good.   This is over a half hour drive from our house, but definitely worth it and we will be going back weekly. The bagels, cream cheeses, and sandwiches are a MUST. Next visit we are looking forward to taking food home so we can enjoy desserts from the bakery section, it looks so good.",

Finally we asked another waitress to get whoever that is suppose to be our server. Once she arrived, we ordered a Ruben and Overstuffed Tuna salad sandwich.  The order took a while to come, but they were worth the wait.  The Ruben is juicy and tender. The tuna salad had good flavor and not over mayoed. Both sandwiches were over stuffed and soooo good.

And they serve it on a sourdough bread. Which was my fault of course but I thought that it would actually come on a roll the bread was so thin that it soaked through the salad sandwich and to be quite honest was subpar. So my recommendation when you go to this place is go for what's not on the menu I'll try the matzoh ball soup next time",

Since it was a traditional NY style deli, I of course had biscuits and gravy.  I will say, the cream gravy was very good, had chunks of sausage in it.  Could have used a little more pepper.  The knish was good, but too thick for me.  It was crunchy and had good flavor, but if it were thinner, it probably would be the best I have ever had.  Service was great, although I went before 8 AM.  So, not even close to 1/2 full.  The deli case looked awesome, I wish I lived closer.  Given the drive, probably won't come back that often, but we certainly will come back some.  It's worth a half hour drive.",

It's located in an office complex off Rainbow and Summerlin pkwy, with plenty of parking.  They make all their own bread and bagels in house, the brisket is delicious, and their deserts are ridiculous!  I mean, their cookies can be bigger than your head!  Who doesn't like that?!  I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here, at worst, a mediocre one every now and then.  But honestly, they carry all the traditional NY deli that you just hope to find somewhere else.  They also do a good matzah ball soup, knishes, and have good lox, which is key.  My grandfather was a fan because they had a bunch of the Dr. Brown sodas.  Personally, when I want some good soul food, this is where I go.",

My grandparents are Polish and Irish but this Jewish Style Bakery/Deli was right up there alley. My Grandpa and I ordered the appetizer size stuffed cabbage because for about $8.00-$9.00 my gramps had a hunch it was a pretty big portion. He was right! It came with rye bread as well. I'm sure the normal portion would be huge for the $12.00-13.00 range. We were very happy with the taste and I was also informed you can get the sauce on the side if you want to add to your desired liking. Another family member enjoyed the Pastrami sandwich which I am looking forward to trying soon.  With a few more great meals in the future at this place, I will have to elevate my rating to the 5 Star level. 4 for now until I'm wowed a few more times!",

I don't come here for the coffee, which is drinkable, but not the best. I come here for this heavenly lump crab dish.... and the deli/bakery items. My mom had me try the potato cakes last time we were there and..... excuse me. Had to take a breather. Just thinking about those delicious, wonderful potato concoctions with the apple sauce.... Yummmmmmmmm.  The cafe service has been great for me each time. The last time I was there was on a Sunday morning and they were jam packed!!! The waitress was great and attentive, even though the place was packed. On busy days, I understand poaching eggs can be a little difficult because there's a lot more to pay attention to, so when I pointed out that my eggs had been overcooked, without hesitation, she comped me for one of my favorite things in the bakery. (I didn't want them remade.... they were still edible)  The bakery staff is why this place didn't receive a 5 star rating from me. Since I'm still new to the place, I didn't know that you had to stand in line at the deli to get service at the bakery. No one spoke up and when I tried to get the attention of one of the guys, I was blown off. When I finally received service, I placed my order and then asked for something from the deli. He treated my request as a big inconvenience. Needless to say, if it's a busy day, I'll just eat at the cafe and leave my bakery/deli order for another, less busy time.  Their food is great. Their bakery and deli items are delicious. I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone, but I would tell them to be patient and try to go when it's not so busy.",

    "text": "I spent my formative culinary years in New York City.  I know a good bagel!  That doesn't make me Einstein, nor will we mention that name again in a review about bagels.  I am happy to say I have officially named The Bagel Cafe the second best bagel in Las Vegas.  You might think that is no big deal, but it took me more than 20 repeat visits to issue this award.   Now let's get on with the details.  The place is apparently owned by one of two brothers.  I heard the other brother owns the bagel place at Suncoast.  I also heard they don't get along.  It's just a rumor...  but an interesting one.  The bagels here are nearly perfect.  A certain hardness is required on the outside to match a chewy inner bagel.  They come real close to New York perfection here.  They have all the required varieties, and appropriate toppings.  Whitefish salad to Cream Cheese and Salmon they have it all and it's tasty.  The service is typical New York style.  No warm friendly teenagers who want you to know their name here.  More like veteran deli personnel who are bored stiff with your order.   That is not a complaint, by the way.  I love it all.  I feel like I am down on East 14th street all over again.    The food comes quickly with no fanfare.  The plates and trimmings are all deli standard.  The restaurat is clean and even the bathrooms aren't awful, though the line can get out of hand and make things unpleasant.  If you on weekends, plan to wait in line.  If you are a fan of NY deli... plan to spend some $ after the meal in their deli.  Grab some lox and bagels to go.  I'd even pick up a bag of Wise chips for lunch tomorrow.  (The plain Wise chips still make me salivate at the thought of opening the bag).  Very reasonable pricing so it won't break the bank.  Parking is tight so leave the SUV at home... please.    Overall, a great bagel experience with all the trimmings.  So are you wondering where the best bagel in Las Vegas can be found?  Well, I might let you know one day soon.  For now I will keep the lines there short and just give you one hint.  The guy that owns the best NY bagel place in Las Vegas... possible the best on the West Coast.... isn't from NY.  He's from Chicago.  Say it aint so.....",

We dined in both times. I shared the fish platter (belly lox) with my mom and it was fantastic. The bagels were delicious and the serving of cream cheese is enough to serve 3.  The following day, I returned with the whole family in tow, and tried the Crab eggs benedict.  It was delicious, but the ONLY downfall was that the poached egg was overcooked.  I asked the waitress about it, and she said that is how they normally do it, and next time to specify that I want the runny egg-yolk goodness instead.  The crab cakes were crabulicious and I can just imagine how much more amazing they will be with my yolk of choice.    My husband and mom both ordered \"Overstuffed Meat Sandwiches\" (pastrami and brisket) and our mouths watered as the tower of meat was served.  They both ordered whole sandwiches and had enough to take home for an afternoon snack.    The service was quick and very friendly. It is quite the happenin' place (especially around brunch time on the weekends) so I recommend calling in advance to put your name on the list if their is a long wait.  Although if there is a wait, there is a take-out area with displays of bagels and cream cheese, meats, smoked fish, and pastries galore to wet your appetite.",

We also both got the sandwiches, which were good but far too big to even hold. The french fries were crispy enough (just the way I like them) and their portions are pretty large. BUT I tried the pizza bagels and they were god awful. The marinara had a really bad, sour aftertaste and the cheese was congealed. So, that pretty much ruined my meal a bit for me although I'd still be willing to go back and try a couple of other things on the menu.",

The bagels have unique flavors (sundried tomato?!). And the bakery... oh man, oversized delciousness.. if you're in the mood to splurge on calories, get the humongous cinnamon roll (I shared it with a friend, and we still could have used 3 other people to help us out... but we were champs, and ate the whollle thing, ha!)  Apparently the salmon platter is bangin, my friend says she usually gets that with fam.   But this time, we made our own bagel sandwiches... Sundried tomato bagel with scallion cream cheese, tomato, and a fried egggg... And like I said, reallly cheap..  As far as service goes, it's what you expect from a deli. Nothing amazing. People just there to get the job done.",

Their food is fabulous and the service is great.  Love their huge salads, especially the shrimp salad.  Their Sicilian Omelette, egg salad, etc. etc. etc.  I have been for breakfast, lunch, dinner and take-out.  Reminds me of Sunday mornings when I was very young and the bagels, lox, cream cheese and white fish brunches at my grandparents.  LOVE this place. Desserts are huge and they have the all important Black & White cookie and their sugar free Rugalah is awesome as is the regular.",

I ordered a pound of pastrami which was over $16 and asked to see what it looked like, and it looked fine.  However, when we got it home it was dried out a bit and very, very lean that it tasted like corned beef instead.   I warmed it up and it was totally dry.    It had no fat on it which maybe might be good, but this had no taste at all.  Very disappointed in the pastrami.  If it doesn't have any fat in it, it is tasteless.  I will not buy this again.  Bagels, yes, pastrami, NO!  Sorry!  Bought some sable fish also, which was good,but $50 a lb???? wow! ( only bought a few slices and  it was over $15)",

    "text": "After reading this before posting , the sound of this review may sound as if I may be  affiliated with this place . I can assure you I am not in any way. I am a relatively new customer of theirs and the following are my impressions after about 3 visits.    Doesn't get better in Las Vegas . Grew up in NY and have struggled to find a good deli / bagel place . This by far and away is the closest to NY. They have takeout for most things sold which includes deli / bakery /bagel items. They also have a sit down restaurant which is great.  Breakfast items I have tried have all been excellent .  Standouts are the Corn beef hash , two styles of knish (3 are stuffed one is NY style )  Bagel sandwiches are fantastic. Looking around the dining room will only make you have ordering remorse as you see the awesome selections other people have ordered. The menu is very large offering many traditional Jewish dishes which are staples in NY  and traditional american breakfast plates .  The one thing that truly stood out is the service. I have gone to 5 star restaurants and have spent more than a mortgage payment on meals that included sommeliers and waiters with assigned assistants, and not received anywhere close to the service and unbelievable upbeat  attitudes as the staff there.   So from bagels with numerous cream cheese options , to the diet killing bakery counter with things like cannoli , black and white cookies , rainbow cookies , gourmet muffins etc etc to the NY deli staple the classic (bagel) breakfast egg sandwich , this place has it all .     minor cons not worth even bumping them from a strong 5 star review.   #1 Take-out does not have a large menu posted  to know whats available at the takeout window when ordering.   #2 (I'm sure they have heard this a thousand times) The parking lot is tight and cramped . Be on your toes and bring along a little extra patience . its worth the minor inconvenience .   #3 No chocolate-milk in the bottled  beverage cooler. I think in NY its is part of the licensing agreement for anyone selling bagels to have it on hand. I guess not in Las Vegas.   #4 it can get crowded on the weekends. It has been around fore a long time. keep in mind there is a reason people will wait 20-30 minutes.  Early bird rules apply .",

The cashier could have been a little friendlier, other than that the Bagel was awesome and they really slap on a lot of cream cheese. It was a meal in itself. I also couldn't resist getting some fresh squeezed orange juice.Thanks!",

    "text": "We've been going to the Bagel Cafe for many years and are always happy with our favorite meals. Some of our favorites are the chicken soup, chicken pot pie, omelets, French toast, cabbage rolls, turkey dinner and of course, the bagels. All of the servers are friendly and efficient. We've never had a bad experience and will continue to eat there on a regular basis. There are only two disappointments. The first is that they will only bring you one tea bag when ordering hot tea and if you request another one you will be charged for another complete set-up. If you drink coffee they will keep filling your cup until you leave! I asked the owner why there is a difference with the tea and he said that people will steal the tea bags if they leave them on the table which still doesn't explain why they simply won't bring another when asked without the additional charge. It doesn't make any sense at all. Every other place I frequent for breakfast leaves a nice little selection on the table. The other downside is the parking lot and if you've ever been you know what I'm talking about. The parking spaces are not to code because the complex did not have enough parking spots to accommodate the businesses based on the use so they tried to squeeze in a few more by making them narrower.",

They must know that formidable competition is opening soon and yet, when my  corned beef sandwich came with a twist tie in the coleslaw, their reaction was...\"Oh, sorry, the bread is stored above the prep area so it can happen.\" We didn't make a fuss with staff at the time, except to say they probably shouldn't have changed extra for the coleslaw, but I wrote to owners and have received no response. Apparently, they do not care about making a customer comfortable that the situation was taken seriously and remediated or extending any compensation at all for the unpleasant experience of chewing down on a twist tie in your sandwich!",

My squeeze ordered corned beef hash and eggs. What she got was some peculiar tasting cold corned beef mixture. I ordered chopped liver on a bialy with a slice of onion. I got chopped liver on an onion bagel. Servers that we knew were missing; strangers were in there place. What happened? When we were checking out the cashier asked \" How was your meal\". Our answer was awful. Her response was \"That's too bad\". That's too bad!! Forgot to mention that this happened on a Saturday at 1:00 pm. In the past we always had to wait for a table at this hour; today we were told to choose any table and there were at least 6 tables available. What happened. What happened?",

    "text": "I've eaten at this place several times. Despite my two star rating, the food is relatively good. My last experience, however, left me with a bad taste in my mouth (pardon the pun). First, the portion sizes are obscene. I ordered a Cobb Salad and it was piled high with a half-pound of bacon, a half-pound of turkey, and a half-pound of ham. I'm not joking when I say I was absolutely disgusted by the sight of it. It was portioned for someone who is morbidly obese and rides around in a Hover-round waiting for bypass surgery or in line waiting to have a limb amputated because of sever Diabetes. Seriously...it's gross...and a total waste of food. Who wants 8-10 strips of bacon on a salad? It reminded me of why I don't like Deli's like this where they serve cumbersome sandwiches that are meant for three people.   My second complaint about this place is a sign that I noticed on the door. It read, \"This is a place of peace...no weapons please\".  Are the owners brain-dead and tone-deaf to the environment we find ourselves living in now? Do they believe that a criminal or gawd-forbid, a terrorist is going to read that sign and say to themselves, \"gee, they don't allow weapons in here, maybe I should go to a Denny's.\"? I legally carry because I have a constitutional right to protect my family and myself. Law abiding citizens with CCW and law enforcement officers are NOT the problem. Why would you put a sign in the window telling criminals that they won't find any resistance inside?   Those two reasons alone make another visit unlikely. But, if I'm dragged back by friends or family who want to eat there...rest assured, I'll still be carrying...despite their idiotic \"kumbaya\" sign.",

I'd probably give this NY style deli 4.5 starts but since I can't they don't necessarily deserve a full 5 star rating.  Let's go with the good then I'll drop my tiny bomb on the bad.  The food is high quality and always fresh.  They have amazing breakfast that nearly all come with a bagel and one of their amazing cream cheeses.  Love the scallion cream cheese.  Lunch is crazy good and HUGE!  They offer gigantic salads all with fresh produce, meats and cheeses.  The also offer great dinner specials.    Today we had a tuna melt that was made with great tasting tuna salad and fries.  We also had a cabbage roll that was served with a cup of soup and of course a bagel with cream cheese.  Loved it all!  Parking isn't an issue as there is plenty of it.  The place is always packed but there is never a long wait so don't fret!  The biggest negative is the staff and their \"I don't give a shit if you're the customer\" mentality.  They kids act like their stuff doesn't stink (imo).  Anyway great food and will be back as I can get over the negative...",

    "text": "Well...when I've been wanting to eat here for quite a while since it has been listed as a Best of Las Vegas restaurant.  It was very busy in here as well so I had high hopes.  Let me start out by saying they have many choices for lunch which looked great.  The hot dog with Chili, Cheese and Onion spoke to me so I ordered that and it comes with French fries as well as a choice of Macaroni salad, potato salad or cucumber salad.  My husband got the Pastrami sandwich on Rye, which looks huge on the menu.    Our food took about 25 minutes to get (something that is listed on the menu that I overlooked when ordering), unfortunately when it arrived I was highly disappointed with the first bite that I took.  When you order a hot dog with Chili you expect a hot steaming hot dog and chili.  Mine was cold.  The cheese that was put on it was a torn up cheddar cheese slice that wasn't even melted so that means when they put the hot dog together it was luke warm or cold to start out with.  The only plus was the french fries were nice and hot and crispy.  The potato salad had no flavor and unfortunately the pickle that came with the plate was sub par and kinda gross.    My husband received his pastrami and it was dry and not nearly as big as they advertise.    When walking out we decided to go look at the desserts and the bagels.  They look amazing but this place is all about nickel and diming you.  The menu states no sharing, there is a split plate fee of $2.00.  Also, if you want to order a bagel and cream cheese make sure you ask for a whole one other wise it is a $1.00 charge to cut it for you.    I don't see myself going back to this place, the food wasn't all that great and I don't like having  \"extra\" charges for things that should come as part of the service; ex: slicing a bagel so I can eat it at the table.",

I just happen to be in a bagel kind of mood start the day so figure perfect opportunity for some yelping.   Talk about bagels, bagels, and not just bagels. I had no idea since this was my first visit. It felt like almost whole deli section in major chain grocery store. One section that has all kinds of bagels in wire baskets choose from everything and anything can imagine. Each basket is well label and LOVE the way all the sections are displayed for the customers. Clean glass display, clear easy to read labels, and everything looks fresh. The selection of cream cheese again just about had everything and everything can imagine. I ended up going on safer play sun dried tomato bagel with regular cream cheese. Toast the bagel coast you dollar extra find odd. It was awesome bagel. The cream cheese was solid. The veggie cream cheese was looking awesome just wanted stay neutral flavor and enjoy the bagel. In the same section had assortment of cold salads can choose from. On the right have deli section with cheeses, deli meats, and not often seen in deli sections had couple dried fish or smoked fish looked like could get. The dessert section!!!! The biggest section of all of them. Really nothing that I would not pass up to try. I was just in bagel kind of mood.   The restaurant area itself is decent size with counter area. Looks and feel like local coffee shop decor. I just got bagel to go so have no idea about the service or anything about the restaurant. Not doubt if in breakfast mood The Bagel Cafe is solid choice start the day!!!",

I came to The Bagel Cafe dozens of times when I lived in Vegas and especially when I worked in the same business complex this restaurant is part of on Buffalo, right off of the freeway.  I visited recently while on a trip and it is the same amazing place.  Voted 13 years now for Best Breakfast by readers of the Las Vegas Review Journal, this cafe with fresh bread, bagels, pastries, desserts, a deli and serving lunch too is a real gem.    My fave bagel was the pumpernickel and they still make it.  Damn it is good.  I love the spinach and feta omelet.  The cannolis are superb, the real deal, and they are huge.  I recommend the latkes, eggs benedict, and chopped potatoes.  The chopped potatoes have this tomato zing to them that is just right on the dot.    For lunch, get a sandwich that will have enough meat on it to feed three firemen.  Try the corned beef.  Yummy!  Salads are great too and yes, my friend, they come with a bagel and cream cheese.  If you can't eat it all, take that bagel home for a snack later because you can't waste heaven.  When it's warm and sunny, there's outdoor seating which makes the situation even better.  You can order ahead for carryout or go to the counter to your right upon entering to get your bread, dessert, sliced Boar's Head or anything else they offer to go. They also offer catering.  Portions are nice and big.  I couldn't finish my omelet but I shoved it in because you can't waste food like this.  I took the rest of my bagel to go.  Oh man are the bagels the best.  And big.  Get some kind of dessert and take it to go if you're going to explode.  You won't be disappointed. You've got the black and white cookie, hamentashen, Mexican wedding, and holy mother, they even make cheesecake the right way - the NY way.  There's never been an issue with service here.  A little blunt when they have a line out the door for people paying their tab but not at all rude, just busy.    You get your choice of the bread you want when you order breakfast, which is served all day.  A taste of New York in Vegas.  Don't miss this.    Parking stinks because the cafe is in a business park that lacks parking to begin with and it super busy due to the popularity.  It's worth dealing with it though.    The atmosphere is that of a deli.  Simple but good tables and chairs with a NYC skyline painted on one wall and everything's clean. It gets pretty noisy when they are busy which is to be expected.  You may have to wait 30  minutes for a table; they don't take reservations, this is a casual restaurant.  However, it's worth the wait and service is fast.  I would not bring kids here simply because of how big the portions are and really, the food is just so amazing it would be wasted on a kid's palate.  It is family friendly though so I'm probably just being a snob. ;)  Food: 5 Service: 5 Ambiance: 4 Parking: 3",

The wait went by quickly though and we began our feast. I ordered corn beef hash with an asiago bagel and plain cream cheese. My boyfriend got a pastrami sandwich which looked divine. We also ordered dessert to go which I highly recommend. Next time I think that I will do to go instead of sitting down. The food was well worth the long wait and inconsistent service.",

They keep on seating people without regard of the servers being slammed. We sat for over 20 mins at the table without anyone come by to even said \" hi, I'll be right with you\". The busperson gave us coffee and disappear. We had to flag down someone to track down a server.  But people who know the owner got served before people been waiting for long time. The food may be good but I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here unless you're a friend of the owner. This place no longer offer a good eating experience.",

I had a veggie omelet with a bagel and the bagel was toasted served with cream cheese.  My omelet was a bit overdone but the potatoes were made with peppers, onions and paprika were full of flavor.  I liked the coffee too.  The bakery had plenty of bagels to choose from and lots of other sweet treats that you could get to-go if you don't want to stay and eat.

Surprisingly you had pumpernickel. Too bad you gave me a shortchanged dozen everything bagels (I ordered 2). Not surprised. I should know by now that the guys behind the counter can't count. Even if you tell them how many of each bagel. Always short 1 or 3.  So now I really & truly am done with you. No more messed up orders. No more low quality food. No more e-coli from your undercooked frozen burger patties. No more crappy service. No more surly attitudes from counter guys. No more pathetic excuses for a manager.  I guess I'll have bagels & pastrami again next visit to NY.",

    "text": "I always want to order off the extensive sandwich menu, and love the reuben, whether with pastrami, corned beef or better yet a combination of the two (for slightly extra) but I inevitably fall on my favorite: the Matzoh Ball Soup. It is literally (not figuratively but in the very real sence) the best Matzoh Ball Soup I have ever tasted. They use both white and dark meat chicken (dark meat being where the flavor comes from) and are sparing in their use of white onions. Most soups with onions taste like onion soup with carrots and a tiny bit of chicken stock thrown in. Chicken is both the predominate flavor and ingredient. Spooning through it is like wading though a lake of chicken and flavor. It is divine. I always order the bowel sized, it is good for two meals and comes with a bagel and the topping of your choice.  The spinach and feta bagel with the garlic-cheddar cream cheese is my favorite, but the jalapeno cheddar bagel/schmere is a close second. And the pastry case! Cheesecake is the light and fluffy variety, I suspect they use mascarpone, and the fruit toppings are divine, rugelach, cookies, they even have \"spinach pie\" which I suspect is spanikopita but have yet to try because I always order the additively wonderful Matzoh Ball Soup. Cannot recommend enough, but I have never eaten in, as the space is always oppressively hot, being a bakery and all, and I prefer to take the magic home and eat it in air conditioned luxury.",

    "text": "Ask any New Yorker what they miss most about back home and every single time you get the same three food related responses. The pizza, the Chinese food, and the Bagels. While the former two are admittedly debatable there is clearly one great Bagel place in this town. The Bagel Cafe is just like back home. It's even worth a drive if you aren't very close by. I've tried Brooklyn bagel deli, big apple bagel, and a bunch of other \"New York bagel\" joints and nothing comes close. They are either too hard even when \"freshly made\" or just not right. I'm sure a lot has to do with climate here, I make pizzas here and understand that it's tricky. But this place gets it just right. You can order a dozen which actually gets you 14 and a pound of cream cheese for like 16 bucks if I remember correctly. The cream cheese is great here too. I get the regular but they have all sorts. They also have awesome desserts here as well. I'm a sucker for good rainbow/venetian cookies and cannolis! Mmm. They also have tons of other stuff I haven't had there yet, I go for the bagels.  They have a large dine-in area also. And it's often busy here, though never really bad enough to have a wait. I can't recommend this place enough! That said I'm not huge on dining in here. But I never really dine in at Bagel shops. Not even back home except for when I was still in high school and one was right next door. So take that for what it's worth, I get mixed experiences the few times I've dined here for breakfast and lunch.",

Cold cuts, deli salads, rainbow cookies (made the right way with almond paste), pastries, etc. etc. have all been outstanding. Wish I lived closer, but will be a must-stop every time I visit my family in Summerlin.",

I don't even know where to start, we had more than three different servers none of them even said hello or introduced themselves. We literally ordered french toast, eggs, bacon, and toast. Approximately an hour later the food arrives, there is a HAIR on the plate with the eggs. The server takes the eggs and then five minutes later comes back out with new eggs minus the hair. Great.. so when we got the bill of course the eggs were still on there even tho we had waited almost an hour for the food and when we got it there was a hair. I gave my card to make the payment not even looking at the bill (which was my fault) and when they brought it back i took a look and of couse with my luck they charged me $4 for bagels we didnt even order!! The manager said there was nothing he could do we could pick a pastry we should have reviewed the bill before paying. SMH great service, thanks for the hair! Wont be returning here ever again!!",

No flavor.  The sandwich comes with a side and I wanted the pasta salad but they were out of pasta salad so I tried the coleslaw.  I usually love coleslaw, but the coleslaw was also bland. Sadly, even the pickle sucked. It tasted like a cucumber that hadn't fully turned into a pickle yet.  Also tried a few sandwich-style butter cookies (which I usually love at other places).  But this place skimped on the chocolate filling, so they were disappointing, too. Add a bottled soda and the total for my takeout lunch was just under $19. (I did not get a itemized receipt, either.) That and unfriendly service, too? Yikes!",

The first time the waitress brought out the sandwich it was missing the tomatoes and bacon and the cheese wasn't melted. The second time the sandwich wane out the raw tomatoes and bacon we stuck in between the bread and cheese I mean the cheese wasn't melted. It looked like a cheese sandwich you give your 6 year old. The cheese wasn't even melted and the tomatoes were still raw. I flagged the waitress down and returned my sandwich. The regirse time the Sandwich calme out everything was looking good but it wasn't on sourdough it was plain white bread.  At this point I decided to just eat my food as the rest of my party was already finished eating. I mentioned it to the waitress and not one else did she apologize instead she got an attitude with me. When she brought the check she told me with an attitude that they had taken my sandwich of since I wants happy with it. I don't know what happened today but customer service was not a priority at the bagel cafe today. It would also be very helpful if the kitchen learns what a grilled cheese sandwich is.",

Felt like we were being kicked out even though we sat down and it was still a little over a half hour till close. Doesn't take super long to eat sandwiches. Oh well.

    "text": "I stopped by Bagel Cafe on a Saturday around 12pm, and there was about a 20 minute wait. I decided to take my order to go, which is convenient and super fast. I ordered a turkey pastrami sandwich on wheat with macaroni salad. While the man at the deli made my order, I browsed the dessert case. They have a wide selection of cookies and pastries, most of which are super sized. I decided on the chocolate cupcake, which looks like a jumbo version of a Hostess cupcake.  I am not a huge sandwich fan, but this one was pretty good. Fresh veggies, and a load of meat. Half of the sandwich was enough to fill me up, and I have a big appetite. The macaroni salad was actually pretty good too. The portion was tiny and it's a little sweet, but I'd get it again. The pickle - don't bother. It had the most odd taste, and it's more like a cucumber than a pickle. Thankfully, was free.  I was really excited about the cupcake, but sigh. The ganache on top is done really well. The cake, however, is incredibly dry. There isn't enough ganache or cream filling to save the cake. You'll need a glass a milk with this one.  I added a bag of chips and CJ's Italian ice to my order, and my total was a little more than $20. A little pricey, but the food was pretty good.  Overall, very good experience. I will check them out again.",

Over all it was a positive experience, but there were some things that caused me to shake my head a bit. The positives: - The bagels were delicious and just like back east!  - Our server was very friendly and attentive - Their deli counter was very impressive, and provided a lot of to-go options - Their portion size was very generous and we ended up taking a good bit of our fish platter home - They started us off with some bagel chips and pineapple/coconut cream cheese which was excellent  The Negatives: - They were very rigid as far as the menu went.  The waiter had to check and make sure they could do certain things.  This sometimes is a red flag.  I am the customer, charge me more if you have to, but give me what I want! - We got a slice of banana cream cake and a frosted cookie (free with a yelp check-in).  The cake was just ok, and the cookie was almost tasteless   Overall, I would definitely return to Bagel Cafe (especially to pick up a dozen), but I there are other places in town to to better get that taste of home!",

Everything from cookies, cakes, pies etc. I've never had a lemon bar so huge and delicious! I'm here for anything lemon!   They have a full service deli with meats, spreads, fish, etc, too.   Hands down one of my favorites places to stop for something good to eat in the mornings or for lunch.",

    "text": "My wife and I have eaten here several times and although the prices are a bit on the high side, the bagels and \"schmears\" are absolutely fantastic and when you get seated they give you bagel pieces (like chips) and the cream cheese of the day. The breakfast is tasty with light fluffy eggs and crispy bacon. The home fries can be a tad under cooked at times, so if you like them crispy be sure to ask to have them cooked a little longer. The dessert case is epic! We especially love the rainbow cookies. Once you finish your meal swing by the dessert case and check it out. For lunch my personal fave is the bay shrimp on a salt bagel with the potato salad. Quite tasty. Also, the soups are always freshly made and highly recommended.",

My friends had soups and sandwiches with bagels, but there's nothing wimpy about these soups and sandwiches. These are still meals that Nordic Vikings would be happy coming to after a bender of pillaging and conquering.  I've had their bagels before, and I don't think they are particularly extraordinary, but that's just me. Pastry cabinets here are full of very rustic pastries that didn't appeal to me much, but it's been working out for them! Something for everyone at The Bagel Cafe!",

My favorite shmeer is the smoked salmon. I love lox and bagels!! The pastries are larger than your typical pastries you'll find elsewhere and they aren't as sweet, which is a major plus!  The restaurant part is amazing also. They have a wide variety of breakfast, brunch and lunch selections. The serving size is pretty big!

Rachel was our server and was top shelf besides cute. She was able to answer any questions on the choices we were asking about and also explained the different cuts of meat and how each tastes.   Chopped liver and corn beef on rye was orgasmic. Picked up a few bagels and cream for home. Best we've had since NYC. Place was crowded. Good sign. This is the best deli around.

This place is always packed with people and with very good reason, everything they offer is good and authentic right down to the Black & White cookies and Rugalas iconic to NYC/East Coast bakeshops. Me and wifey were craving bagels and our stomachs led us to The Bagel Cafe. We shared their generously portioned Meat Platter and selected Brisket, Corned Beef and Pastrami for the meats (there's many more in the selection) plus Spinach Bagels with Pesto Cream Cheese (flavour of the month). The meats were very tender and juicy which nicely pairs with the included pickles, macaroni and potato salad. Since this is a bagel shop first and foremost, their bagels does live up to the expectations, chewy and lightly crispy outside (when toasted) while being soft and delicious inside. The spinach flavour plus the pesto cream cheese is a heavenly balance and does remind us of the good bagels and deli shops we frequented when visiting New York. Let's not also forget that they are also a bakeshop and offers a full line of baked goods usually found only in The Big Apple. All this sensory goodness plus outstanding service makes it a pleasant experience anyone will gladly be patrons of.  PS. If you have the Yelp app, do check-in for a freebie cookie or similar offer of the day.",

Bagel Cafe is very popular, extremely busy during breakfast & lunch, and the service is hit or miss. But one things for sure, the Bagel Cafe has a stacked menu, the prices are better than most, and the portions are huge. Okay, that's three things. I've never had a bad experience with my food at the Bagel Cafe and I usually stick to one of their omelets and of course, the Everything Bagel. Be on the lookout for their specials on the board because you never know. What I tend to crave is usually on that board. Overall, Bagel Cafe continues to be one of my favorite places to go for a big breakfast. Just remember, this place gets busy and what usually comes with that is a wait for a table and occasionally, slow service.",

This place is BUSY and a little chaotic specially near the entryway where the deli/ waiting room/ register line for to-go/ and pastries are.... if you are easily overwhelmed or in a huge rush maybe you won't like it. But ordering to go was faster than I thought (you might mistake people waiting for a table as people in line for to-go orders)... it's fast and easy to order to-go. But if you have the time to sit down here and maybe there's a 20 min wait specially on a Sunday... I tell ya ITS WORTH IT!  I found this place to be exciting and the food was so so good! We ordered a lox plate to share (my husband and I ordered 4oz of lox and with the bagels and we where stuffed so careful not to over order)! We got my son French toast it was very good and a huge amount as well! French toast is made with challah (the BEST way!) we also got matzah ball soup (comforting perfection) it smelled so good too I was beyond impressed. The pickles are good,.. I can't wait to come again and try more things out. Our waitress never refilled our coffee but otherwise everything was perfect. We ordered cheesecake and a black and white cookie to take home for later. This place is popular for a reason!",

The blintzes are awe-inspiring, light and creamy with a powerful lemon pucker. The bagels could not be fresher and the smears help to keep your tastebuds craving more.   I was given a free sample of the bagel chips with spread and they were fun and crunchy - not something I would write home about though. The eggs benedict; however, was the single best breakfast I've ever experienced. A perfect ratio of solids to hollandaise, the muffin wasn't soggy, the egg was a perfect poach. With one bite all chatter, chewing, and clanking of plates disappeared - it was just me and this beautiful meal.   I highly recommend you get this benedict into your mouth. I'm rushing back to get it into mine.",

My husband had a pastrami sandwich and it was filled with so much meat that if he didn't have a big mouth (only kidding) he could have had a hard time taking a bite.  The only thing that was annoying was that they charged $3.00 for a small bottle of Dr. Brown's cream soda.    I have to agree with some of the other reviews that the staff do have a \"New York\" attitude however we were lucky that we didn't experience it this time.  Everything went very smoothly.",

The bagels are very good, they have the cookie bar that compares favorably to deli's back east, their Challa is excellent and makes fantastic french toast, and they have a vast variety of cream cheeses.  The dining area is a great place to enjoy some good Matzoh Ball soup, however, it is a very busy soup with noodles and carrots drowning out the small matzoh ball. (A good Matzoh Ball soup should have the Matzoh Ball on display in the middle of the soup.)  I was not impressed with the Corned Beef sandwich, nor did I think I would be having yet to find quality corned beef outside of NY or to a lesser extent, LA. What was disappointing is the photo on the menu appeared to be piled high but the sandwich I received had a much more pedestrian helping of Corned Beef, most likely due to the rising cost of meat.   The rye bread was cut too thick and overpowered the sandwich but was a tasty bread in and of itself.  I do enjoy that they sell Dr. Brown's black cherry soda, Wise potato chips, and day old bagel chips and breads.  The deli meat counter however is often overpriced for the same boar's head meat you can get at the supermarket and the Lox prices are extremely high.  But go with a lox cream cheese which has large chunks of lox but is reasonably priced.",

Is the wait worth it? The food is not bad, but personally I only wait for amazing food. Another thing I did not like was their warning on the menu. The ask to please not to share the sandwich!!!! Come on!!! It bothers me a lot when restaurants tell you what to do, its not like I'm not paying for the product, it shouldn't be your concern what I do with my food! Good thing I dont like sandwiches but the warning is just annoying I ordered the crab egg Benedict and it was too fishy for my taste. I know it sounds weird but I hate when my meal smells and tastes too fishy!  I had to opportunity to try the turkey sandwich and it was pretty fresh. However, the sandwich was not extraordinary!

    "text": "Born and raised in New York the warm and soft bagel is a part of my heritage. It seemed that I would have to board the Concorde if I was to have a New York bagel in a reasonable time. That was until I stepped foot in the Bagel Cafe.    The Bagel Cafe is a slice of the Big Apple approximately ten miles northwest of NY-NY in the Summerlin community of Las Vegas. The four times that I have had breakfast here in very recent times, my mind literally left Vegas and entered a New York bagel restaurant. As soon as I stepped on line, displayed right to my left were Wise Potato chips. Wise Potato chips are a popular brand of potato chips that are extremely popular in New York, but sold in a few places in Vegas :( . When I looked to the right, standing out from the display cases of cookies were the rainbow cookies. Since leaving New York, I have rarely laid eyes on them in Las Vegas. The closest rainbow cookies that I have seen to Las Vegas were at Chompie's Deli in Phoenix. After being seated sitting in front of me was the warm and soft bagel. Three times, I ordered egg salad on a bagel and once a BLT on the warm and soft bagel. The quality was superb. The bagel sandwich was overflowing with egg salad that was topped off with lettuce, onions, and a tomato. The BLT was the antithesis of the pathetic BLT that I recently ordered at Panera Bread. It was overflowing with crunchy beacon. With each sandwich, I ordered potato salad and coffee. The coffee tasted just as good as the bagel shops that I remembered before Starbuck's came on the scene. In actuality, the coffee is just as good as Starbuck's.    Just like New York, the Bagel Cafe is crowded. Parking is a challenge, and it is almost guaranteed that some walking is required. The Bagel Cafe is located in a professional park on the west side of Buffalo Drive south of the Summerlin Parkway. Unlike the New York City landmarks, it blends in with the professional buildings. On account of the parking lot being linear with the popularity of the Bagel Cafe, each time I had to walk the distance of two professional buildings (not complaining. I went here before hikes). On weekends, there was a wait. The Bagel Cafe is relatively large and the weekend waits were no longer than 15 minutes. On the other hand, it was less crowded on a Wednesday at 1 p.m., and the \"Please Wait to Be Seated\" sign was turned around to \"Please seat yourself.\"    The Bagel Cafe differentiates from the prices of the New York bagel shops that I know of in New York. Unless inflation at the New York Bagel shops went up in double digits, the Bagel Cafe prices seem steeply higher than those of the bagel shops that I remembered. From my experiences here, it is the Waitresses that can make and break the price. The first two times that I had my New York moments here, the sweet Waitress passed on a tip that if you order a sandwich on a bagel instead of bread (Did not come here for bread) that you get a full sandwich for the price of a half sandwich. Fast forward to the last two times, and the impersonal Waitress was charging me for the full sandwich (check with tip came to around $15). But what could I do?  It would still be far less expensive than flying in a Concorde to New York.    If you grew up with the New York bagel, or are just a fan of it; I recommend the Bagel Cafe. On the four visits that I visited Bagel Cafe, I have made it a point to stop by on the way to a park. Admittedly I planned to hike in a nearby park a couple of those times with the excuse to check-in here. I am so confident that I will get in a mood for the New York Bagel. With that said, I see Bagel Cafe check-ins in my future.  ****Please note that there are other establishments using the Bagel Cafe name or similar to it. The one in the Sun Coast I rated 2 stars.",

I ended up ordering garlic and onion one and it was okay. I also ordered the lox & bagel. That was delicious! I love smoked salmon and it came with a lot of olives and other condiments, but not enough salmon! Its a very cute breakfast joint, but I wasn't impressed. They do have a lot of desserts, breads, and other pastries! They look better than the food. I want to come back just to try their desserts!",

Owner even messaged after the last review, so really hoped it had improved. But just as a frame of reference, I typed most of this review out while waiting for our server to just check on us to see if everything was ok(that's how long she was taking).  Arrived on a busy Sunday brunch, so we more than expected to wait a little. After being seated at the table, it took 15 minutes just to get drinks. Then another 15 minutes to have our order taken. Waited 20 minutes to get food, only to have it delivered to the table with things missing, like butter for pancakes. Also discovered our table had zero utensils set out for a party of 5.  Waitress scuttles away so fast that we could barely tell her what we needed, so more waiting.   Usually I love the food for its authentic Jewish fare. Today, I ordered the potato pancakes. Huge, thick portion of 3 pancakes but served with the tiniest serving of sour cream and applesauce. I would expect the $10 cost could cover a bit more condiment with the dish. The patties are so dry that you need something to balance it, but the scale does not fit what they serve. Also took forever to flag the waitress down for this to get a little more.  I should have stuck with my original assessment and just stop in to the deli to get my fix of NY food.",

Give you amazing service , and some of the best damn breakfast you can get while at it. From walking in the decor is just welcoming. The staff greets with smiles acknowledging you the moment you step in and doesn't have that hectic busy , let's get everyone out of here were in a rush type of vibe.walking in already simply inviting. Its also good to just do something different and that's what the bagel cAfe does. Different . the menus are printed in newspaper and give you bagel chips with cream cheese that changes every now and then. Giving the freedom to the staff to experiment is also a giant bonus in my book and man can they pull it off. Bring any tourist to this spot and you're guaranteed positive feedback. Trust someone who has. The Apple and orange juice are as fresh as you can taste and just gives you that smile on your face from every sip. From the delicious omelettes, sandwiches , and bagels that they serve, to the freshness of the juice you drink down, and all the way until you step out the door of this amazing restaurant , you are sure to have a smile on your face. And that can be surprisingly rare in today's food industry.   Kudos to the owners and the chef!  And thank you to all the staff for making this a five star restaurant !",

They have the best crab benedict with hollandaise sauce. They give you a ton of crab meat and it's real crab meat not fake. If you love sandwiches there corned beef is incredible stacked super super high up. This is probably one of my favorite breakfast locations in Vegas I come here probably three to four times a month. If you're in the area definitely stop by and give Bagel Cafe a try.",

The menu specials are always super and the early bird specials are one of the best bargains in town.  Can get noisy when crowded so I often opt of odd hours when the place is much quieter.  The soup and salad special, smoked fish, matza ball soup, breakfast egg dishes and various cream cheese and bagel options keep me coming back for more.  Don't confuse The Bagel Cafe at the Suncoast with the quality of food and service at the one on Buffalo.",

Reuben, bacon and cheese omelet, and a ham and cheese collectively were a 8/10. You can order for pickup or come in and pickup some bagels, which are AMAZING. Soft, big and chewy even when toasted.",

    "text": "In the interest of full disclosure, I have never been to New York, either state or city.  I have no idea what a \"real New York Deli\" is supposed to be.  (And from the conflicting opinions of the people on and off Yelp who attempt to describe one - including my darling wife, who lived outside of NYC for several years - I guess I'm not the only one who's confused.)  That being said, I'll fall back on the old saying that \"I may not know art, but I know what I like,\" and continue.  The food here is outstanding!  My wife, who was raised Jewish and, as I said, lived right outside NYC for several years and is experienced in New York delis, thinks her grandmother works in the kitchen making matzo ball soup.  I've never had a disappointing meal here.  The pastries are ... well, addictive.  And did I mention huge?  The deli take-out counter is also fantastic, with imported-from-New-York specialties and lots of house-made goodies.  The service is above-average, but sometimes a tad less-than-perfect due to the crowd size.  Nothing that would prevent us from coming back.  The only real knock I have on this place is the seating.  My wife has had several back surgeries, and I have a bad knee-and-hip that makes regular chairs a frequent issue.  We can't always be provided a booth when we arrive, simply because there aren't all that many of them and they tend to go quickly.  It certainly isn't anything that would keep us from coming back.  Other than that one little tick, you'll find the Orchid and I frequenting the Bagel Cafe often.  Good stuff, people.  Well done. -- -- -- -- -- On the newly-established Nighthawk 100-point scale:  98.",

We showed up around noon time on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed but were seated within ten minutes. My wife ordered a Reuben and I ordered the tongue tip. Our waitress returned a bit later to tell me they were out of tongue tip and regular tongue. I asked if this was normal and she couldn't really say. I settled on a philly cheese steak. All I can say is both sandwiches were a disappointment. Small servings and the philly might have just been two pieces of bread and a sprinkling of meat. Onions, peppers, cheese?  To beat it all on our way out we saw a sign on the door that said this is a place of peace no firearms. When will people learn that criminals don't read or care about signs. My wife and I were both armed and managed to get through our sub par meal without disturbing anyone. Armed citizens are a deterrent to crime and not a danger. If you want to prevent lawful CCW post your sign better. As per the law. I guess I'll never get to find out about that tongue sandwich now. Bummer!",

I got no apology only excuse is that no one else has complained about the sandwich. Not offered to bring me something else or even discount it since I didn't eat half of the sandwich. I'm sure I'll be back but just be warned if you complain about the quality of the food or that you just simply don't like something don't expect the management to care.",

Ive worked I this industry for many years and understand that the staff wants to go home, but you still should accommodate guests as best as you can.

The time it took to get our order placed and brought in was about 30mins and this was when they weren't very busy at all. The waitress was not very responsive and when the food finally arrived she brought me a Sausage and Cheese omelet and immediately walked away from the table as soon as I noticed the error. It took 5 minutes for her to return and she already knew the error because she picked up the plate before I even started explaining. Within 5 minutes she returned with the correct order and apologized. The food was average. Would I go there again for breakfast dine in? Nope. I think Denny's and IHOP got a better deal and better menu for that.  Only thing I would highly recommend is there bagels, smear and pastries.",

It's busy and everyone there was in their own little world. Either reading the papers, catching up with friends or stopping by to pick up deli meat, this place is worth checking out. However, if you came here for the bagels, fo'get about it, there are better things to have then the bagels. I was super stoked to check out this place but I have to say, I was a little disappointed.   The food is good. It's not amazing, its good. The service honestly, could be a lot better. I like sarcasm, I don't like to be patronized. I get it, you want people to feel like you're in NYC, but I still like good service, at any restaurant. I like the overall atmosphere. If you're looking for a quick bite to eat or just a whatever place to have breakfast or lunch, this is the spot.    They have a pretty big menu which is nice because it gives everyone an option. But, the one thing to have is the matzo ball soup. I've never had it before and I knew I had to try it. I can't imagine eating at any other place more Jewish than this.   It arrives and it steaming hot. The steam alone had flavor. It was so delicious. This broth had to have been made by a 90 year old grandma in their kitchen. It's everything chicken noodle soup needs to be, plus the matzo ball. If I was ever sick, this is the soup that I would want, hands down. The flavors were intense and then subtle and then suddenly you're reminded of sitting in grandma's kitchen being served soup. Oh, just writing about it makes me want to have some.  If you save room, you'll find that this place has a great pastry shop. All the sweets are gigantic, so plan on sharing. The deli bar is okay. I've had better service and sad to say quality at my local grocery store. It's sad because people can have a much better experience if this place started looking at how the staff treats the guests.  Ciao and until next time, have eating everyone :)",

This is as close to the holy grail of Katz's Pastrami Sandwich (in New York) as I've come across in Las Vegas. I'm talking thick + juicy, melt in your mouth Pastrami between two think slices of bread. The pastrami taste like real meat because it's actually cut out of a hunk meat slow cooked to near perfection. None of this fake jello-y dry salty pastrami you see packaged at the store. I'm salivating as I write this review.   Finish your meal with a giant Black and White cookie and you have yourself 10 miles to run on the treadmill. But boy is it worth it.",

You never tell someone your grill is not operational because you are cleaning it well after the order is placed, and you never blow off a customer waiting to be served at the deli counter when there are several workers standing right there.  I cannot emphasize how arrogant these idiots are.  But you know what, you are going to lose a ton of business now.    The manager is a moron too.   He offered for us to come back, but no way. Service is and always has been a problem there, so he could care less because of the sheer volume of people that come through there.  Arrogance at its best.",

I've never been to a bagel-specific establishment so when the opportunity came, we thought we would stop by and say hello!  The options here for cream cheese and bagel types is just incredible. My buddy and I were almost overwhelmed with just how many choices there were but the guys at the counter were super patient and helped us out for our first time, even giving us recommendations. The place was packed too! There wasn't room to sit but we really didn't need to because the bagels were soon in our hands. They came out nice and toasty and really brightened our morning. We decided to eat them outside on a little bench just out front.   The bagels were also pretty big, me being able to only finish one but the second made for a good lunch later! This week we are back in Vegas in a hotel not as close to The Bagel Cafe as we were before but we might make a point of stopping by again! I've never had bagels this good!",

Truthfully, whenever I think about bagels I would think about Einsteins and didn't have the desire to stop by. However, my sisters (fellow Yelpers) and I decided to try this place out since its been bookmarked in our Yelp all for a long time.   From the moment you step into this place, your transported back east to New York. The cafe set up is straightforward with a large dinning room on one side and a bakery/deli on one side for takeout. There is a constant flow of people coming in and leaving. It's apparent by the many awards and celebrity photos with autographs that this cafe is very popular.  We ended up sitting in the dinning room and ordered 3 different omelette, lol. A cool thing about the omelette dish, it came with a choice of a side item. We all opted for the homestyle fries and was very pleased with the flavor and consistency of the seasoned potatoes (highly recommended). Each dish came with a Bagel and Cream Cheese of your choice, which was unexpected since our omelettes dishes were very sizable in portion. We ended up getting a plain, everything and asiago bagel. All the bagels were fresh and delicious with no compliant, just prepare yourself for a carb craze meal. The 3 omelettes we got were the Mushroom and Cheese, Veggie and Spinach and Feta Cheese, which was our favorite but they were all good. Overall we had a great experience and our server Kayla was good and knowledgeable about everything including the history of The Bagel Cafe. We will come back to try out more of their delicious food!  2017 Yelp Review #25",

    "text": "A long long time ago. In a city far away, I moved to Vegas and ate a bagel.   It was a 5 year experience that I'm glad that I had. Among many of the places I patronized while I lived there was the Bagel Cafe.  I stumbled across it with the help of a friend. Okay, we were driving by and saw it. The rest is history.  Fast forward 256 years into the future (sometimes it feels like that) and my wife and I are in Vegas for a whirlwind conference. Unfortunately, like most times, we didn't have time to do much. But, we were leaving sin city on a Friday morning and my wife wanted to stop one of the places I used to haunt.  I forgot the name! :(  Quickly, I grabbed my phone and Googled Bagel Summerlin. The name and address came up and voila, it was JUST as I remembered. Deli in the front and seating in the back.  The first thing you notice is the place is clean.  The second thing you notice is the staff is friendly.  My wife ordered a full pastrami sandwich on marble rye. I ordered a tongue sandwich on traditional rye.  I asked the waiter if the tongue was fresh and he said yes.  In about 10 minutes, the sandwiches were delivered. My mouth is watering thinking about it now, several days later! The pastrami was very good. Almost as good as a place I know in the Valley. The tongue was exceptional. Good taste, tender, and soft.  The sandwich was almost too big for my mouth. It was delicious! The only thing I didn't care for was the rye. Yes, they make their own rye, but it was too soft and squishy. I like a rye with a descent crust and a heavier rye flavor. But, that's me. The rye, as a bread goes, still was very fresh. My sandwich was GONE is short order. My wife took 1/2 her sandwich to eat 7 hours later on the drive home.  ---------------- Bottom Line  The Bagel Cafe is good. I take that back, it's GREAT! The best time to go is during the week. Weekends were way TOO busy from my recollection, but should that stop you? No! Go anyway. A crowded deli is part of the New York experience!  Yes, I will go back when I'm in Vegas again!!! When are you guys opening one in Reno??",

After today, I figured out why I don't opt to go here if I want something quick..because the service is the complete opposite of quick.  Today, our table ordered fairly simple breakfast items (eggs, bagels & pancakes), but it took almost 30 minutes just for our food to come out and when it did come out, the bagels were toasted as requested, but they weren't warm and the pancakes were just a little undercooked.  I could understand if they were busy, but they weren't. The parking lot wasn't full when we came in and there were still empty tables around us (& from previous experience, this place is packed) Anyway, even though the bagels came out and weren't warm, this place gets 3 stars for the variety and overall flavor in their bagels and cream cheese.",

    "text": "Thankful to Yelp for leading us here, wayward tourists with a rental car looking to get away from the hordes of (other) visitors, eager to eat something we don't have back at home...  The Bagel Cafe is an unassuming spot in a nice office complex right below Summerlin Parkway off Buffalo. Lots of parking on the weekends when the other businesses are presumably closed.   Even on a Saturday morning, the wait wasn't bad. Service is quick and tables turn pretty quickly.   We ordered things from the ENORMOUS menu that we don't have back in Hawaii. The turkey Reuben sandwich was good, the rye bread was perfect, the cheese was yummy, the turkey was really fresh and moist. The sauerkraut, Russian dressing, and potato salad could have all used a bit more kick, but no complaints here. It was a delicious sandwich and I was thrilled to have leftovers to eat at midnight. :)  We also ordered the babka french toast (!) off of the specials board. After ordering, the server ran back to the bakery to see which flavors they still had available (out of cinnamon, only chocolate left.) No prob. The slices of babka were battered and grilled, served in triangles with butter and syrup. Not too chocolatey to taste everything else. Fun and delicious, and again, enough for another breakfast the next day!  This was a great find, probably one of the better off-strip breakfasts we've had. The prices are great. TBC is sure to go on the rotation for future visits back to Vegas!",

The portions are good sized and taste awesome, the menu has a lot of great things to choose from and this could be two separate businesses. You have the deli and then you have the bakery/dessert businesses and those desserts are all crack. In Seattle, I had several go-to places to take out of town visitors. this is the top of my list for people who visit me in LV. There are a lot more options here than we had in WA but anyone who has spent time in NY and loves this sort of food or has never had it and needs to be introduced is going to love this place. If I were going to ding them for anything it would be their pickles. I like them but they aren't True dill and you kind of need that if you're going to run a place like this.",

Liked: The most appealing thing about this place is when you walk in the have display cases full of bagels and desserts. We sat ourselves and I ordered the Ruben and my husband got the French dip. Both sandwiches were huge and tasted fresh and made from scratch. They also bring out bagel chips and this blended cream cheese that was delicious.   Dislikes: The staff could use some soft skills in customer service. They were dry and not very friendly.  My daughter ordered the pizza bagel and it was not hot when she got it, the cheese was not melted and we ended up sending it back. The crazy thing is we didn't get an apology or anything. Then they brought out her same pizza bagel that she bit off, they just warmed it up. She didn't care for it because it was over cooked on the bottom.   I always give a place a second change so maybe the second time will be a charm.",

Though they need to work on their speed and customer service behind the deli and bakery.  Expect the place to be packed and busy.  At times along with that it can be noisy,  If you are in a hurry this place may not appeal to you.  If you like to sit and chat, and drink coffee for long periods after finishing your meal, you might be disappointed.    One of my favorites is the Crab Cake Benedict.  In the ($16) range.  Perhaps a bit on the high price side but they can easily command that price.  It is the best I have tasted traveling all over the place.    Plus as with all their meals, it is served with a free plate of crispy bagel chips and a sample of their special cream cheeses.  With coffee they are down right addictive.  Just don't fill up while waiting on your main order!  In addition to their sit down area.  Their deli and bakery are top notch, selection and quality wise.  We haven't found any better in Las Vegas.  Speaking of their bakery.  If you try one of their Ho Ho's (over 1/2 pounders) you may be ruined for life.  We keep going back for these as a carry out!",

I don't know if it was just the type of sandwich I ordered or if I was upset about my wifeys disappointment in her food or what, but the overall experience upon a repeat visit was just very disappointing.  Not sure about returning for awhile. Too many other options.",

Go somewhere else where they don't STEAL from customers , where they make things right and are honest about the items they send you and somewhere where they make things right if they mess up.

After finishing off a cup of Matzoh Ball Soup chock-full of chicken, this time, rather thhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bagel-cafe-las-vegasan opting for my usual Pastrami and/or Corned Beef Sandwich, I selected a Brisket French Dip with Provolone.  The sandwich arrived with well-melted cheese and moist and juicy Brisket piled inside a soft French Roll, while Diane again selected a melt-in-your-mouth Roast Beef French Dip.  Both varieties of French Dip were made even more pleasurable dunked in a rich and memorable au jus.  And, my side of homemade Potato Salad was first rate, as well.  The other two dining companions, my nephew and niece, were also well pleased with, respectively, a Reuben Combo of Pastrami and Corned Beef, and a Chicken Salad Melt on Marble Rye.  Service was fine, and the casual, buzzing atmosphere convivial.  Another decidedly superior meal!",

And let me say they were definitely on point.   Personally, I think everything was just little on the pricey side. The level of service was that of a New York Deli, which is never exceptional. I think due to how chaotic Everything was, & the overall price of everything is why they get 4 starts instead of 5. If I could have given 4.5 I would have. I'm a little harder & possibly a little more biased when it comes to things close to my heart lol. Tough love .   Bagels outstanding! Plain bagel lightly toasted with cream cheese. Little much on the cream cheese but I can't complain that's for sure. I got a chicken salad sandwich with the works; also very tasty! And a side of shrimp salad; decent. Lastly, my favorite dessert; I got a linzer tart; AMAZING! It wasn't a lot of food & that total (Togo by the way) was $40.00.   Now don't mistake my overall critical review; I WILL BE BACK; 100%. Stellar place. Stellar food. Can't wait! Hopefully they will let me back in. Thank you to the entire team. Keep The deliciousness coming!",

It wasn't long until we were seated.  What impressed me was the pastry/dessert windows. It looked amazing! So we knew we had to get some desserts to go!  The second thing that impressed me was the fresh orange juice machine! You could see all of the oranges & how the machine works.  We were immediately greeted by our server, and took our drink orders. I was interested in the grilled chicken sandwich w/French fries. Someone ordered the Matzah Ball soup which I've never had before. I was offered to taste it & to my surprise it was actually good! Now, as we got our sandwiches, I was shocked at the size of it: they're huge! I seriously didn't expect it. My chicken sandwich was DELISH! I managed to finish it all, and I'm glad i did. I'm ready to come back here again.",

Came here for breakfast recently with a gf of mines. We dined in and ordered the chocolate chip with strawberry cream cheese and egg bagel with strawberry cream cheese. We also decided to try out the potato pancake since it was a popular menu item on yelp reviews.  Food was ok. Service could have been way better. Our waitress forgot about us throughout our meal. lame! On the positive side, there was no wait to be seated! and the guy behind the counter gave me his honest option and told me the blueberry bagel batch wasn't looking good that morning.   Would I come back? Probably not. Unless I'm driving by and craving a bagel, BC wouldn't be my ideal spot for breakfast.  Love the cool newspaper menu and all of the yummy carby treats in the glass window.  If you love big bagels and live in the area, stop by BC.  - Miss Yelp 2011",

They even serve you complementary bagel chips and schmear before you order. Black and white cookies and rugelach are legit. Their pastry case is to die for! I could just stand there all friggin day. Bagel Cafe, I am happy I found you amongst these fake New York style delis in Vegas that serve mediocre food for way too much money! Im so thankful to have a place to drop by and pick up some delicious deli snacks and treats from the bakery without spending a fortune. See you soon",

Charging $13 for a sandwich is insane in itself, so to be a \"New York style\" spot, I put my faith in the sheer cockiness of charging such an outlandish price expecting a phenomenal sandwich. What I got was a unbelievably generic below par sandwich. Run of the mill bread, two slices of store bought cheddar, over cooked and under seasoned brisket. That's it. Nothing else.. IT WASNT EVEN WARM. Cheese not melted at all. They have the nerve to put packets of mayo and guldens mustard in the to go container with the sandwich.  Can't be bothered to dress their own sandwiches. Only thing good about this order was the pickle on the side. Shame on you for charging people 2x the normal amount for a sandwich of this quality. Even at $6 it would have been disappointing.",

Super excited, I ordered a pastrami ruben on rye. It took about 30 minutes for the to-go order to come out, which was a bit disappointing. That's ok I guess, but when I finally got down to try the rye, it was flavorless. That's ok again I guess. There's only one thing though, that really really bothered me. Coming from New York, I love me a good Black and White cookie, and the Bagel Cafe displayed these gigantic beautiful Black and White cookies, and boy was I excited to try this glorious cookie. It looked so delicious. I wanted it... I wanted it badddd.....  Now in my mind, a Black and White cookie is the beautiful love child of a cookie and a cake: soft inners with just enough crisp to keep a firm shape and texture. When I went for my first break of the cookie, it felt soft, and not just soft, but cakey. That's ok, I guess again....... Maybe the frosting would be better? No... The frosting was way too soft. I have to say, this place came off as a possible diamond in the rough, but every part of it was just more and more disappointing.",

Both sandwiches were huge but we couldn't stop eating them. Suzy had her favorite, the stuffed cabbage. She loves this one and it too was huge.   Sides of potato salad and coleslaw were excellent.

The crunch of the exterior is just snappy enough, and the insides have the proper cushiony bounce without tasting fake.

It's been years since I've actually eaten here, so I can't speak to current strengths/weaknesses of the dining experience.  The bagels, however, are good, if a bit pricey. You'd do better to get a Dozen (which really means 14) than just a handful. But get what you need - it'll be worth it.",

Their fries are good too and I'm not even a fry person.  They have home made should everyday as well as gravy which I get sometimes.  Also the Challah French toast is thick and awesome if that's your thing. Make sure you get fruit on it because it doesn't cone with it.   For their desserts you cannot miss the home made cheese cake our tiramisu. Seriously too die for. I come here maybe once a month but I'd come  more often if it was closer to where I am all the time.

    "text": "Ordinarily I am the cheap-o kind of guy that would scoff at the mere thought of paying $26 for a meal for one person.  So why is it that I am absolutely fine with paying that much at Bagel Cafe?  Because I got more than just one meal out of the food I ordered.    I saw stuffed cabbage on the menu uder \"Starters\" so I thought I would start with that.  I also had made up my mind on a pastrami reuben.  Little did I know that the cabbage would come out the size of a small baby and be served with a whole bagel.  As soon as the cabbage came to my table I knew I was in trouble.  I joked with the waitress that I may need a to-go box before the day was over.  When she saw the glazed over look in my eyes when the sandwich came, she looked at me and said \"Yeah, you're gonna need a box.  Let me know when you're ready.\"   The cabbage was hands down the best I've ever had.  It was tender enough to eat with a spoon.  There was no choking down of tough cabbage leaves.  The sauce was tomato perfection.  The meatloaf within was formed well and held its shape better than mama can make it do.  I could have and perhaps even should have made a meal of just the cabbage.  But no, I had to get the sandwich too.   The sandwich was what I have been searching for in Las Vegas for years.  Pastrami stacked higher than my mouth will allow in and covered in gooey melty cheese, soaked with dressing and topped with crunchy and mild sauerkraut.  It was a magnificant sight to behold.  The battered fries, macaroni salad and pickle spear on the plate all added to the feast.    At the time of my surrender I had eaten half of the cabbage, half of the bagel, half of my reuben, the macaroni salad and a few fries.  I thought I might need a wheel chair to roll my fat butt back to the car.  With my leftovers I ended up with no less than two more meals.  One meal was the remainder of the cabbage and bagel.  The other was the reuben and fries for lunch the following day.  With that, my $26 meal soon turned into three and, at a more resonable $8 and change per, was easier to justify.",

I feel like customer service is a huge part that contributes to a restaurant and if you have crappy service it doesn't make you want to go back no matter how good the food is .

I loved it then and I love it now as it's grown into a full fledged restaurant with many wonderful dishes to offer.  There aren't too many places that make matzo ball soup as good as my own, but Bagel Cafe's is so good I don't need to bother making my own when I'm here.  I have never had any problem with the servers here, they've all been pretty good with staying on top of everything. I no longer live in Nevada but you can always find me here for my soup and bagel when I come to visit my grown kids.  The prices are little high, but still worth it to me. As always, I will be back again and again.",

You can order off the regular menu and it is nice because you can see all the sides up close to see which ones you want if you get a sandwich. Great selection of cream cheese spreads (lox being my favorite). Bagels are cooked perfectly and the perfect amount of chewy! It is so hard for me to get the perfect bagel after being spoiled growing up eating good bagels from LA. This bagel is a match to what I grew up with. They also have really friendly service although a bit rushed.   I appreciate the sugar free rugelach and the large cookie and sweets selection. I do love the chocolate rugelach the most. Not too sweet. I think their corned beef is really good unlike other places in town that it is dry. It's not cheap though. Overall I think the prices are above what they should be, but it's one of those places I would pay for good food every once in a while.",

Located inside a business complex near the Buffalo freeway exit, the Bagel Cafe is a charming family owned breakfast joint that's been around for 20 years.  When you first walk in, you're instantly greeted by the glorious sight of bagels and homemade cream cheese that they have. You can also buy the bagels here separately too.  Came here on a Sunday morning around 8:15 am and was able to find a table no problem.  Here you seat yourself to an open table and a server will be by shortly to wait on you.  The servers who waited on us were attentive and friendly too.  The dining area itself is large and clean with two different sections.   My friend and I ordered: -Biscuits and Gravy ($7.95) - Wow I seriously was not expecting this dish to be so good!  The buttermilk biscuits were nice and fluffy, not dry at all like biscuits can tend to be sometimes.  At first glance the dish looks like they put wayyyy too much gravy on top, but Bagel Cafe clearly knows what they are doing and put the right amount on, not soggy at all.      -2 oz. Smoked Fish Platter ($11.95) - I was a little scared that this wouldn't fill me up but I totally underestimated it!  Comes with fish of your choice, I picked the smoked salmon, and it also comes with tomato, red onion, cucumber, olives, and a bagel and cream cheese of your choice.  I got the everything bagel with plain cream cheese.  I loved this!  I also think compared to other lox bagels I've had this is about mid-range price...not the cheapest but not the most expensive either.    -Side of Homefries ($2.95) - Tasty and seasoned pretty well but I did think this was a bit on the mushy side.   My friend and I can't stop raving to each other about how good this place is.  Now that I know how awesome this place is I will definitely be back.  A great breakfast dining experience all around!",

When we want a quick and light breakfast we go to the deli and order a couple bagels with cream cheese,  the scallion cream cheese has huge pieces of real scallion in it.  They have a good variety of bagels, I usually get an asiago or cheddar jalepeno bagel.   I also picked up at least 2 items from the pastry side also.   At least 2 pieces of the rainbow cookie ( which is more of cake bites than cookie) and either rice pudding,  black & white cookie or maybe a roll.   When you order these to go, the LG cookie and Cinnamon roll is big enough to fill a lg take out container.  They are huge! Tip:  Know what want to order by the time it's your turn, this is a busy and fast paced deli so do your research and look at a menu because it can get a little overwhelming if it's your first trip.",

I must admit, I think it's pretty cool how they've got the bagel display and other treats set up. It's just a comfy cozy kinda feeling to me.   Last time we came it was mid morning and this place was p a c k e d! So this morning we opted to go about 7:30a just after they open to avoid the crowd; and we did just that. We were invited to seat ourselves when we walked in and immediately upon seating we were greeted and asked for our drink order. This was a good start and excited me because after our recent trip to PR I was glad to get great and quick customer service at a home town restaurant.   I ordered the spinach and feta cheese omlet (added tomato); it came with home fries and a bagel with cream cheese. The bagel I loved. The home fries were ok. In the omlet they used fresh spinach which was great, I hate when restaurants use frozen or canned crap. Other than that I didn't really care for the omlet; I'm super picky with eggs and the eggs in this omlet were dry like over cooked, & it had browning on the outside of it which to me is disgusting. My bf had a bagels and lox; he loved it, just like he loves everything.   The reason I give this place a 3 is because the food here just did not knock my socks off AND because they charged $4.50 for an orange juice, really? After we left I made the bf go around back and see if there was an orange tree back there because that's the only reason I can justify paying that much for a glass of juice, is if the tree is in the back growing those damn things and picked fresh daily. Lo and behold, there was no tree. I'm willing to give another try though sometime in the future. Their service though is definitely a 5 stars; from the friendliness of our waitress to how quick the food came out (under 10 min).",

At first when I ordered my over stuffed bagel sandwich (spinach and feta bagel, lemon pepper turkey, avocado, lettuce, bacon, tomato), I thought the prices were a bit high (almost $12 for a whole sandwich). However, you get a lot of food for the price! They also brought out a snack for us before our food was ready. My sandwich was super tasty, and it was large enough that I was able to take half of it home for another meal. It also came with a choice of potato salad, macaroni, cucumber salad, etc.. The restaurant itself is very clean and pleasant, and the women's restroom looked like it was well maintained. This seems like the kind of place that can get busy quickly, so I would plan on a wait if you come here on a weekend day! On a Monday around noon, there was no wait.",

Currently writing this from the bathroom.. like I said, stick to the bagels and you'll be fine. A bit pricey, but totally worth.   EDIT:  As you can see somebody from the restaurant aggressively responded to me and essentially called me a liar.  I had eaten nothing else that day, and my illness was most certainly not caused by anything other than my meal at this restaurant. I have never had the flu, a stomach virus or food poisoning before eating here.  They have just lost two customers and I will be sure to spread my opinions to coworkers and friends.   Downgraded to one star due to their response. It was unnecessary, rude and simply inaccurate.",

    "text": "I have to start with a disclaimer that I grew up in New York/Philadelphia and recently moved from Chicago so I've had probably some of the best Jewish food in the country and I have high standards. I love Jewish food and will spend hours hunting down the best place I can find whenever I move somewhere new. That being said, I can't understand some of the people who have reviewed this place and say it's the best food they've ever had. Most of them have probably lived in LV all their lives and simply don't know any better, because as anyone who's lived near large urban cities probably knows, LV is pretty much an ethnic food-challenged culinary backwater for the most part.  To be fair, my gf and I stopped by here a while ago on a Sunday at a very busy time. The line was out in the parking lot. I figured the food must be authentic and legit. Wrong! We ordered some easy, quick to make dishes and waited almost an hour, even sitting at the counter with open spots. I get it was crowded, but the service was sub-par, the waitress would disappear for 20 minutes and never bothered to even check back with us or apologize for the long wait. They need to figure out how to serve the public properly, either they're chronically understaffed or just don't have the right systems in place. The lack of acknowledgment of poor service borders on inexcusable and even if the food had been better I still would have thought twice about returning. The \"fresh squeezed\" orange juice with no pulp was most likely Tropicana, it was room temp to boot. The bagels are doughy and too big, pretty much tasteless. You know it's bad when bagels from Einstein's totally outclass this place. The eggs were under-cooked and mediocre. To me the True test of a good Jewish deli is how good the potato pancakes are. Total fail - they were too thick, not hot and soggy. They basically tasted like a big home fry patty, not seasoned correctly either. It was disgusting I couldn't even finish it.  They didn't want to substitute anything, and every add-on dish was $6 or more. It was big-city prices for an inferior execution. I honestly lost my appetite and was so disappointed with their \"real Jewish food\" that I couldn't wait to get out of there. Nothing seemed special or unique about this place - they just overcharge because there really isn't any competition in the jewish deli biz in Vegas. I'd rather eat at Subway then ever go back to bagel cafe. For those of you who don't want to be part of the sheeple herd that seem devoted to this train wreck of a pretend Jewish restaurant, I highly recommend Weiss Deli in Green Valley, Henderson. It's a hole in the wall with spot-on service that can give some of better delis in Chicago a run for their $. The matzo ball soup is served in a trough-sized container and one matzoh ball is literally baseball sized, enough for 2 or 3 to share. The plates there are so big you could eat for 3 days on a sandwich. Compare the two and see for yourself - I guarantee you won't be disappointed. It's doesn't get much worse than Bagel Cafe.",

We had been sitting there with drinks we received from the \"beverage server\" for a while and watched 2 other tables get sat, served their drinks, AND have their orders taken. Meanwhile the server NEVER came to our table. He didn't even acknowledge us. Finally we had to ask for a new server.  Once we actually had a server that paid attention to our table, everything was great. The food was delicious. It was a bit weird how 2 meals were served 5 mins before the rest of the table, however as previously mentioned, the food was delicious.  After we finished we went up to the deli/bakery. Wow, what a mad house; couldn't tell where the line to order was and who was waiting to be sat. This place would benefit greatly from expanding. The deli/bakery had TONS of treats to choose from. And pretty good prices for their baked goods.  I'll be back for the food, just hope that the service is better.",

I have no doubt I will return here many more times as I have gone more than a dozen times. That may sound strange with three stars but that is solely because of the attitude of staff. Most all employees there, especially the young ladies who work the checkout counter, look completely miserable and act as if they would like to see you drop dead. Always some yelling or conflict behind the counter among staff too. Most people who take orders are clearly bothered.   No, I'm not from New York and no, I don't know \"How we do 'tings.\"  I just have this silly idea that when you give people money they should attempt to not look irritated. Strange because staff at Del Mar in South Point are always awesome and helpful.   Thanks for the great deli food. And if any other customer or member of the management of this location would like to tell me I'm just too sensitive or that the staff are not miserable and acerbic, then you are all most welcome to BIOYA.",

We came here because a friend wanted to go and it was in my list of places to come check out! :D   So really quickly it's a bakery/deli and a restaurant/cafe. They seem to get pretty busy on the weekends, seating for smaller parties went by faster than for our large party (typical). Oh! You also need to make sure your whole party is present or they won't seat you.   So I ended up with an Asiago bagel with jalapeno cream cheese and biscuits and gravy! I couldn't decide on what I wanted so I settled and thought, \"you can't go wrong with biscuits and gravy.\" Yeah......nope! My bagel was much more appealing in taste than the biscuits and gravy. So a complete major disappointment in that. I liked the gravy but it could have used a little more flavor, there were large chunks of sausage in it which I think they could have cut up a little bit more. I like my biscuits in gravy with a LOT of gravy, like my biscuits need to be covered. I ran out of gravy before I ran out of biscuit, so it's a little disappointing to me. The bagel was good though!! I enjoyed getting chunks of jalapeno in my cream cheese :D   Service wise - well it was alright. They were busy and we also had a decent size party so it's difficult, won't give them too much of a hackle for that.   Overall it was a good experience, enjoyed some of the food but I want to try more stuff!!",

Inside the dining area, the menu is listed on a nostalgic newspaper. I had the special listed on the white board: asparagus with goat cheese omelette with French Vanilla coffee. The eggs were right up my ally, light and fluffy, a sign that they were cooked low and slow. The asparagus was young and tender, chopped small resembling green onions, and the serving was generous. That, with creamy goat cheese, was a very satisfying dish. The toast was made from homemade wheat bread, thick and light. The bill was fifteen dollars... The quality of the food in relation to the price trumps the quantity, along with the wait (there is a disclaimer on the menu that your order can take 20 minutes.) The coffee was aromatic and flavorful. Service was standard, nothing to write home about.    I could not stop there, though, and had to take something home. The chicken pot pie looked too good to pass up. Reheated, the gravy was buttery and creamy, reminding me of a rich cream base you would find a clam chowder, just with chicken.   I will return with a few things to on my mind to try, including the lox, and the huge eclair.",

Waitress was very nice and polite, and my Reuben was superb! Half of it went to go since it was fairly big.  Big shoutout to the manager PABLO! Very polite and attentive, making sure we are enjoying our lunch, and brought my daughter crayola and drawing paper to keep her entertained . Thank you very much Pablo for your attention, we had a great lunch!   Overall great spot with great customer service ( no wonder why they're always busy) will be back again.",

Our server was very nice.   Food quality: 5 Stars  There food has always been good when I came. Everything seems to be very fresh. I generally order the nova lox. For lunch I order a pastrami. This place has that New York Bagel Deli vibe.   Parking/location: 1 Star   Beware this place has the worst parking ratio ever, and people don't know how to park so when there is a space chances are you won't be able to park there so just be patient people. Lol  Presentation: 4 Stars  I'd prefer my food to be prepared for me rather than them bring out the Nova lox platter for me to make my own bagel. Or at least provide the option.",

In traffic, I drove an hour to get here, only to learn that they had to close early due to a roof issue. The manager on duty, Mark, made sure that I didn't drive to the restaurant for nothing-he went into the back and gave me bagels that were to be used for bagel chips (they were out of regular bagels). He also refused my money for the inconvenience.  This was an A plus move that changed my entire day! Thanks you Mark, and thank you Bagel Cafe!",

We stumbled upon this place after a search for black and white cookies.   After looking at the photos, we had to stop by and get some.    On the first trip there, I got a black and white cookie and a few macaroons.   The macaroons were awesome.   The black and white cookies were pretty good.   It was definitely enough to warrant another trip.   The second trip, we got some more black and white cookies to take home along with some raspberry linzer tarts and a raspberry rugalah.   Yummy!   They were all really good.    If you are from the East Coast, or just like good baked goods,  give this place a try.   Will I be back?  Sure, I have to try some of the other items they have there!",

Fresh cut cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, red onions, olives and giant fresh pickles.  With delicious lox, enough for two in the box. Yummy whipped cream cheese and this is our Sunday morning go to!  They have different types of salmon too if you don't like the lox. They have large portions and everything is always goodI always get a cappuccino with sugar free vanilla.  Deliciousness!  Looking at the menu if you are Jewish, this is the place to be in Vegas!    I have to put an update because sadly i am not getting the same service my last two orders were a mess.  Today i ordered bagels, nova for multiple people and they forgot the cream cheese!   Their app doesn't work either but j typed it all in but the bagels were ordered with cream cheese.

Corned beef hash... homemade, also fantastic.  I would know which one to pick from if I was here alone.  Corned beef hash and eggs or pastrami sandwich, very difficult decision.  I don't know if I'm being cheap, but the restaurant is a little pricey.  It's like 8 bucks for a cup of soup?  I'm not sure about that, and it says you can't share sandwiches on the menu, I'm not sure if I like that idea either.  Anyway, this place is great, I don't mind spending a couple of extra dollars and having a great meal, I'm excited about bringing my parents here, it's nice to know places like this exist in Vegas.",

    "text": "Okay, I judge a Kosher style deli by their Matzo Ball soup. A REAL and proper way to cook the broth is with a chicken carcass, saute some onions, chop up a couple of stalks of celery and several quartered carrots. This is the traditional way a broth for Matzo balls is made. NOT with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. When done, it should be a clear broth with just the carrots and celery floating around. Maybe in a pinch some dill thrown in for measure. Real Matzo Balls are made with a binder of schmalz (rendered chicken fat for you goyim out there).  I found the entire bowl to be uninspiring, with tasteless Matzo balls, and with all sorts of flotsam floating in the bowl. Remember: this is NOT a diet food, which brings me to the corned beef.... Corned beef should be served with a thick layer of fat on it....this is where all the flavor is, and is once again..NOT a diet food. If you don't like the fat simply remove it from your sandwich.  I don't care for their practice of cutting it all off prior to reaching my table! If I was concerned about the saturated fats I wouldn't be eating any of this in the first place.  I have even gone as far as requesting a lot of extra fat, and it always comes to my table, trimmed and tasteless. Without this rich flavor it changes from Corned beef to peppered beef. Completely altering the taste and drying the meat out.  I know most everybody being so health conscious these days would disagree with me, but for old die hards like me the old fashioned way, really is the best.  If I want decent corned beef from now on, I'll make my own.  You really cannot find an authentic place in this town, and having lived here for years, I speak from experience.  My Bubbe would be rolling in her grave...",

    "text": "I have always been the biggest fan of the Bagel Cafe. I have visited multiple times always for bagels and cheese to-go.   After my last visit the day after Christmas I may never come back...EVER!   Let me start off by saying that it was very early and not busy at all. Just me and two other people in the bakery area.   I placed my order for sliced bagels and cream cheese selections and moved on to the cashier.  At the register, I decided that I needed some soup for our lunch later that day so I ordered 2 chicken noodle soups w/ 3 matzo balls in each.  Didn't seem very difficult and the cashier said that she \"would ring them up but just this one time since it wasn't busy.\"  ??? I didn't know soup needed to be ordered from the guys at the bagel counter...fine, my mistake, now I know for the future.  No big deal.  Here's where it all went downhill.  The cashier that I ordered the soup from rang up 3 soups instead of 2.  When she gave me the total I asked why it was so much? (The bowls of soups are $8.50 each)  She showed me the receipt and she rang up 3 soups instead of 2 which was her mistake.  During the process of refunding the soup you would have thought it was the end of the world that she had to refund 1 soup (which hadn't even been packaged yet).  She turned to another employee and rolled her eyes during the process all with me standing right there.  I spent over $50 on bagels and soups to go.  I told her that she was very rude and why I felt that way.  I walked out to my car which was parked in front of the big huge window by the register and she was huffing and puffing around talking about me to her co-worker.  I watched all of this through the window and made the decision to go back inside for the manager.  I told the manager exactly what happened.  He wanted me to \"just let it go because it was the holidays\"...WHAT?!?! Holidays or not when your employees are unprofessional and losing you business you better address your problems.  What a terrible approach from the manager to know I was treated poorly and to tell me to let it go because of the holidays without a simple apology.  No apology...no yelp stars or business from me.  Never again will I spend my money here! There is something to be said for good customer service and this place doesn't have it.  I noticed some other reviews that noted rude and poor service.  I could have chalked it up to the cashier having a bad morning but with a terrible manager it was a double whammy.  I guess being rude is acceptable and you can put up with it or go somewhere else.  The guy at the bagel counter was wonderful.  This issue was from the cashier and then the terrible manager.    Just because I walked out the door and can't hear you doesn't mean I can't SEE you talking trash about me through your huge windows!  From previous visits during the busy times I learned that you must stand your ground in the line or people will just cut right in front of you. People act like their time is more important than yours and it's like they go ahead of you on purpose.  Nobody ever knows whose turn it is to order...pretty chaotic!",

Just seat me at the table. How much more can you make by turning the tables every 20 minutes vs allowing me to sit with a cup of coffee and enjoy a lovely breakfast???? Seriously peaved about this.

She thinks the omelettes are light and fluffy and this is the only place I've found with decent lox and bagels. This last experience might just have changed our opinion though. I ordered the corned beef sandwich, which in the past has been good, and she got her usual. Her omelette came out burnt and tough, and my corned beef was entirely inedible, it was dry, cold and flavorless. I never knew  corned beef could be that bad. The waiter made himself scarce after dropping the food. And the cashier made a joke when she asked me how everything was and I replied that it was horrible. When I said no i was serious that it was horrible, she said \"ok, sorry.\" Completely uninterested in what was wrong or how they could improve it.  While I've always thought this was the best deli food in town, that really has been mostly due to a lack of good competition. With the lack of concern I saw with customer satisfaction, though I would have to say it wouldn't take much competition to get me to go somewhere new.",

Well worth the trip.  It was a beautiful day. When I arrived I was taken by how bright and clean it is.  Checking the menu I was in heaven.  They even have kishka, and chicken soup.  I was met by two sweet young servers who took my order.  Of course I got my chopped liver sandwich with a side of potato salad.  The liver was great but I didn't care for the rye bread.  It wasn't dense enough for me, but still quite tasty.  I have only one other tiny complaint the pickle had almost taste.  I was told that I would have had to ask fore that spicier pickle.  My advice is to forget about the first no flavor pickle entirely.  I finished my meal with a cheese danish and coffee.  The coffee was excellent but the cheese danish was heavenly.  Just amazing.  And its huge.  So big I couldn't finish it.  I'll have it for breakfast before I check out for my trip home. Total tab including a huge freshly squeezed orange juice was around $20.

I actually toyed with the idea of getting a half ... a common practice at the finer NYC delis. And by the look of the picture in the menu, a half just may have worked so long as you settle for accompaniments like fries, potato salad, slaw, etc. So glad I went for the whole. C'mon Bagel Cafe, if you want to compete with your eastern counterparts, you're gonna have to put some more meat on those sandwich bones. The rye was very good, and an excellent pickle, but please do something about acquiring a house deli mustard. As for the bagels. What can I say. When it comes to bagels, size matters, but not the overriding determinant in quality. While they were big enough, they were way too dense and somewhat lacking in flavor. Yeah, I know, I know. Having grown up in the streets of Manhattan, I am way too spoiled to make comparisons. Maybe one day, I'll find a LV bagel that can compete with that of my alma mater. But Bagel Cafe, although good by LV standards, when it comes to comparing to those of dozens of Big Apple bagelaries ... puhleeze!!!!",

Coming here has been a tradition since moving here, and I love to bring visitors.  The egg salad in jalapeno bagel with their house salad is enough for two meal, so I usually get the half portions on their sandwiches.",

The rest of my party are carnivores and were very satisfied with their corned beef sandwiches and matzo ball soup.  The soft drinks were awesome because the diet soda had just enough seltzer.    The service was very good and the employees were very attentive. So we highly recommend eating here to all our friends and colleagues.   Now on to the bakery case, large portions guaranteed to please. It's a very good thing that we don't live close to this cafe.   TIP- if you are dining in you can request a military discount just for the military member (s.) If you are just picking up food then this discount is void.  The location is very convenient to Trader Joe's to shop for items.",

Noisy and messy with abrasive service (part of this place's \"charm\" perhaps?). Part restaurant, part deli/bakery. For Vegas it is an attraction but prices are insane. Every exta (e.g.  toast your bagel, add a slice of cheese, add a slice of tomato, avocado - all at least an extra $1 or more).  $2.5 for a mediocre hamantachen? Now that's Chutzpah.",

If they didn't  have a bakery, I'd probably be safe, but I just cannot resist! So, a friend and I had breakfast this morning.  I thought I'd be healthy and ordered a veggie omelet with a whole wheat bagel.  Oh, it came with home fries, but I think potatoes are also a vegetable.  Anyway, that was delicious and very filling.  After paying our bill at the counter, my gal pal had to scoot, so she left me to \"browse\" the bakery area.  Well, browsing turned to buying, which turned into another instance of me facing my weakness for sugar. At least I had vegetables before the carbs were ingested.  See my pics for a couple of the pastries the cafe has to offer.  There's more to choose from, but you'll just have to go and see for yourself; I had to get out of there before I turned into a diabetic.",

Challah French toast consisted of about four thick, egg-drenched slices. A pretty good version, for sure, but one that was too hefty for one person to finish.

Waited by the side cashier for 10 minutes while she said \"oh you have to wait for a guy to get your ordered\". By then we had it. Put back the $14 pie we were going to buy and lost a sale for additional items. Would have been nice if when we told the waitress we wanted a few things she could have made sure someone helped us out at least when we walked but but she was MIA half the meal too. Guess we'll make the trip to Weiss next time because at least we will get great service.",

Their matza ball soup is my husbands favorite!!!!! They have a great deli with lots of choices and amazing selection of fresh made pastries. Give it a try. It's our favorite place for breakfast and worth the drive!!!",

Usual breakest fair, omelets, spreads, they do a brisk business of take out lunch sandwiches which makes sense in Florida because there's no deli's to go to. Service is good. Looking for a good bagel, you should try this place. - One thing I can't figure out is why are there no Egg bagels in Florida? You can get them in every bagel store in the entire north east. Come to Florida, nada.  But, this place has chocolate chip bagels but no egg bagels, like there's a huge demand for chocolate bagels? Whoever decides to makes egg bagels will get all the ex north easterners business, Just saying.",

My favorite is the garlic bagel (toasted) with the green olive and pimento spread and if you get what you ordered to go and it's accurate (and it's not always this way), then life is good!  Everything else in my experience has been mediocre - including the service at the deli counter, the wait time, the ambiance, the parking/access to the place, etc.    Now, back to the bagels... I did say they were awesome - and they are!  So, if you're looking for a great bagel, in fact, the best bagel in town in my opinion, then this place has exactly what you're looking for.",

Sometimes there is a little bit of a wait but that's because they toast your bagel and put the cream cheese on.  The desserts are also amazing. It's impossible to stand in line for a bagel and not drool over the desserts.  I've never eaten inside but it looks like it would be pretty good.  In 2007 my Husband passed away and we used Bagel Cafe for the gathering afterwards, it was delicious and convenient, and they were so nice about everything.  My Uncle passed away in 2013 and my Aunt remembered how good the food was at my Husbands funeral that she decided to use them for the gathering for my Uncle as well.",

Seriously, I grew up on Jewish food so I do have something to compare it to. Mediocre to me although their bakery is very good. Service slow and not a fan of the wait to get a seat. It's okay, but I'll be trying someplace else. Oh, ordered take out and it was awful. Order wrong, corned beef fatty again.",

We have been for breakfast 4 or 5 times now and the french toast is awesome; the rest of the dishes we had (omelets/corn beef hash) were just okay.  You get a bagel with every dish so it's  A LOT of food.  You definitely get your money's worth here.  But after so many visits I will say I think the bakery side outshines the restaurant itself.  Every single thing we have taken to go has been amazing.   The knishes are a good way to rate a New York deli... and they are fantastic.  Not the ones labeled \"New York Knish\" but the round homemade ones; that's the real stuff.  The almond and coconut lemon rugelach are awesome.  The homemade hostess cupcake is amazing.  But never ever ever leave without a lemon bar.",

The food is the best deli food I've had in Vegas, period! The sandwiches are gigantic and the breakfast fare is bountiful. Each time I've been I've had a different type of sandwich. There are two sizes of sandwiches, the biggest size is huge, but manageable if you've got a descent appetite. All the spicy mustard they offer on the table goes great with any sandwich. My wife is a breakfast fanatic and each time we've gone she hasn't been disappointed. After our meals we take a stroll next to their dessert cases and after about 10 minutes or so we finally make our decisions. They have a huge selection of desserts that are made on site as well as their bagel selection. If you're looking for a legit deli, with huge sandwiches and tasty desserts, this is your place, you won't be disappointed.",

I'd never had that kind of soup before but thought it was quite tasty, and had large chunks of yummy chicken in it. I was thinking that I would definitely come back here. That is until we went to pay. There were seven of us on one check so while the first couple of people started to pay my friend and I went to check out the bakery items. They looked amazing by the way. We noticed that nearly everyone in our group had paid so we came to the register to pay also. That's when I noticed the man paying at the register next to us was complaining to the blonde woman working that we had cut in front of him. The woman loudly stated to him but obviously so we could hear, \"some people need to pay more attention to the people around them.\" Clearly they were talking about us so I said, \"excuse me we were all on the same check, we are with the same people who were just paying.\" The blonde woman working rolled her eyes at me and refused to acknowledge me. Then the woman who was working our register tried to tell me that the other members of my group didn't pay. I left her with my credit card and went to get them. They had in fact paid she was holding a large sum of cash in her hand and she said when I got back \"Oh this was for their meals?\" and acted insulted. Lady we weren't tipping over $100 on the $100  check!! To add insult to this experience as I tried to finally leave a woman coming in the door started walking right into me. I stopped to avoid a collision and she shoved me and said \"excuse you\" to get past me. Obviously I can't blame the restaurant for that last incident but if that's the kind of clientele you attract I don't want to be a part of that group. The food was not good enough to make up for all the rudeness at the end.",

However, even with the crowd I always get excellent service.   This is one of the best sandwich shops in town, if not THE best. If you can believe it, the bologna is to die for. The roast beef is also delicious. It doesn't have any of that gag-worthy pink sheen that you so often see on roast beef.  The egg-salad is perfect - I think the secret ingredient must be some sort of bottled love of grandmothers. The restaurant has got a handle on the details, and I love that.  Menus that look like newspapers. Homemade pickles. Special cream cheese.  Oh yes, the cookies. When you first walk in it feels like walking into Wilka Wonka's chocolate factory. The dessert case may even have angelic lights shining on it. Everything is made daily and is well-worth cheating on the diet.   Although the prices are a bit high (around $10 for a sandwich) you will definitely have leftovers for lunch the next day. My 4 out of 5 stars is because the prices are a bit much to keep me from eating there on a regular basis and the parking lot is a bit harrowing.",

The dinner also came with a side salad, roasted vegetables and later coffee and dessert.  The steak was just as I ordered it, the side salad was a good size and excellent, not just lettuce, the best side salad I have had anywhere.  Baked potato was perfectly done, but my favorite part was the roasted vegetables of asparagus, Brussels sprouts, carrots and green beans.  I was so happy the vegetables were not the usual zucchini with other overcooked generic vegetables.  This is my new favorite place.  Delish!",

They have something like 25 different types of bagels and lots of different types of cream cheeses on a rotating basis. The best are the salmon roe, caviar, lox, and garlic cheddar! Their nova is usually really fresh and thinly sliced and the sturgeon is even better!  I also love this place for the Jewish deli. Their rye is amazing, as are all of the meats. Matzoh ball soup is decent to good. The only thing I am usually not impressed with are the desserts, but who goes to a Jewish deli for the desserts?  The ambiance is very cute - looks like a traditional Jewish deli and the menu is on a newspaper. Sometimes it gets very busy, but once seated, the food comes really quickly. It's also a great place for takeout!",

Everyone's food that was coming out looked so good. I want to return for breakfast.   What I didn't like: When we walked in we waited for a long time to be seated, not because there weren't any seats, but because no one was standing there to seat us. We didn't get a hello or anything from any employee. A few walked by and saw us standing there. Nothing. A guy eventually walks up and seats us. The second time I was there I took my order to go. They were SO BEYOND rude to this little old man standing at the bakery. They asked if I needed help I explained that he was before me and had been standing there a while. They told him he was standing at the wrong place, they mentioned this to him over 5 times as he was putting in his order. He kept apologizing saying normally his wife goes in and he didn't know. OKAY! We get it! Leave the poor man alone and take his order. This place is extremely unorganized as other yelpers have mentioned. I hope they get it together because they could possibly have one of the best places in town!   I hope my third time is a charm! Will update.",

What a perfect place to get warm and have a good meal.  The place was packed and we had to search for a table.  Which we found way in the back.  We were lucky as it seemed there were more people looking for tables as well.  Anyhow, we sit and looked at the menu.  She always knows what she wants so it was really just me looking at the menu.  She got the Matzaball soup and some sort of spinach pastry, the little one a halla bagel with cream cheese, and I got eggs and potatoes.  I'm a sucker for breakfast.    The waitress was nice and took care of our needs.  Afterwards we looked at the bakery.  So much to choose from.  We brought home bagels, cookies, some sort of fruit filled pastry that was sweet and delicious, and an eclair.  So good...   I have also had their chocolate cupcake in a different experience.  The eclair trumps it.",

    "text": "Hopeful...bite, chew, swallow....Meh.  Bite again, chew again,.... Meh. Darn!   Had such high expectations (since I am from New York / Long Island) and have known the joy of real Bagel shops.  Really, Bagel Cafe- your photos are beautiful...your presentation enticing....  You had me at Hamentashen!  But you left me at the booth by the window with a mouth full of Meh.  SERVICE: Counter help (women) are not very cordial and seem disinterested in helping or answering questions. Stood there for a while as they just ignored me making their own coffee and being snobby. This is a service business; shouldn't you make people feel comfortable when they come through the door? And it wasn't just the way we were treated. Watched as other patrons got similar cold attitude. IMHO  Deli counter staff (men) are nice, helpful  and engaged.   One waitress - over worked...but cordial.   FOOD / BAGELS : GENERALLY GREAT Coffee is good. Bagels are great. Lots of Cream cheese options and things to put with Bagels abound. There is an emphasis on real traditional Jewish food which I really appreciate finding in LV! But although the Bagel Cafe has a niche market and offers loads of variety.....  FOOD/ OTHER: Ordered a feta spinach omelet. It came with a glob of feta in one spot. Feta was sour, melted, not Greek- style. Too much grease or butter used in cooking.   Muffins are large, lovely, but oddly lacking in flavor.  Took some other pastries home and found them OK, none are \"wonderful\"- taste is rather bland - not exciting in the mouth. Eating a bite of cranberry muffin as I write...chew, swallow, try it once more, Nope, still Meh!   Overall, not sure we'd eat here again.   Might get bagels and cream cheese to go.  If I HAD to.  Wish it was better experience. Has promise, but it just seemed like they are missing something .... like interpersonal  warmth and flavorful food.   Give it a try, anyway. You might find it better than I did-?...hopefully.",

    "text": "This restaurant seemed a little clustered with many different things.  First you have the bakery, and then you have the seating area for brunch.  Now I was highly disappointed with the service, overall I felt I had to wait a little longer than you usually should.  First off, I don't think any restaurant should have a seat yourself option.  Unless you are ordering from the cashier service yourself and then seating yourself, this should never EVER be an option.  It took about 20 minutes for our server to come and get our order, and it took another 30 mins for our food to come.  So overall, almost an hour to actually eat and order which is something I don't find lightly.  I think the girl near the bakery section felt bad for us so she came and got our order, which I found nice of her.    Aside from the clustered and noisy ambience, the food was ok.  My boyfriend and I ordered the crab eggs benedict, french toast, and the biscuits and gravy with a side of eggs and sausage.    The crabs benedict was good, I think I got way too much meat I didn't even find the bread at the bottom of it.  The flavors were all there though.  I wasn't too fond of the potatoes, I thought it was mushy and to weird of a spice for me.   The french toast was good, a little thick cut and huge but I understand the big serving idea.  I think I needed a little more syrup instead of the small side they gave me.  The bread was really thick, I think more syrupy sweets would do it justice.  The biscuits and gravy was ok, personally I thought it was too light.  I actually like the biscuits and gravy from south point which is rather odd.  But I thought they had more flavor.    Overall this place was ok, I don't think I'll be returning soon because of that clustered feeling.  On top of that I paid $43.00 for everything which I thought was little too pricey.  I could've gone to egg works and paid less than that, but hey that's just me.",

    "text": "I cannot believe that I've never written a review for The Bagel Cafe.  I have dined here well over a dozen times since I moved to Vegas.  They offer the closest thing to New York bagels that I have found in LV.  Both their breakfast and lunch menus have so many delectable choices that remind me of the East Coast.  The line for a table is almost always long, but worth the wait. They also have limited counter seating.  Recently,  I have enjoyed the Matzo Ball Soup, which is chock full of large pieces of carrot, celery, onion, and chicken in addition to a fluffy matzo ball.  A cure for what ails you (or just a tasty soup).  The chicken salad platter- a large scoop of chicken salad, two sides, pickle spears and veggies to make a sandwich with your bread or bagel choice.  The chicken salad is what I would call 'traditional style', no fruit, nuts, or other surprise items mixed with the chicken and celery.  On recent breakfast trips, we've enjoyed the fantastic Potato Pancake with applesauce and sour cream.  Definitely a welcome reminder of Jewish delis back home.  A huge portion of biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon and some of their omelets.    We always seem to walk out with a bag from their bakery case too. Not sure how this keeps happening. ;-)  We freeze most of the bagels and they taste just as good after we take them out.  The cheesecake, carrot cake, cookies, and all the other bakery items we've tried have all been well above par.",

    "text": "We stopped in here the morning of the 2nd for breakfast and I ordered a cafe mocha and the pastrami omelet with provolone, and my Mr. ordered the two egg breakfast with bacon.  I was really jonesing for this breakfast because I'd never been to a place that will put pastrami (and some of the other deli meats) in an omelet.  It just sounded good, you know?    The omelet was great.  The pastrami was really tender and full of flavor.  My home fries were not warm and tasted like they had been sitting around for awhile.  Same goes for my husband's breakfast, which also had his eggs scrambled, not sunny side up.  He always orders sunny side up.  I didn't even notice because I was digging into my tasty pastrami.  He opted not to have it corrected and just helped me eat my omelet.  The mocha tasted like watery hot chocolate and was really disappointing at $4.50.  One of us ordered a chocolate chip bagel with regular cream cheese and the bagel was very nice and chewy.  Really enjoyed that even though there were no discernible chocolate chips in it.  Other than the omelet and the bagel, there's really nothing that was good about our breakfast.  The atmosphere was very noisy.  On one side I had a loud talker blaring in my ear his expertise about car tires, and on the other we had a little poopster who had probably just learned to pull herself up and stand and look around.  She also enjoyed pulling on my husband's shirt and ear.  Not cute or cool.  I wish the people who shot out that kid were paying a little more attention to her.    I would go back again and try some of their other items.  Maybe it was just a bad day.  Our total after tax, before tip, was $31.08 and it was just not a good 30-dollar breakfast.  However, I trust my Yelp buddy, Loon E.'s opinion, so next time I'll have to try the whitefish salad.  Maybe that will elevate my next review.",

I'm hopeful the food will be yummier on my future visit... PS. we got here at 12:45 pm and there was a little bit of a wait, but nothing like California deli's on the weekends. Look on the board for specials because server didn't mention them and after we got our food, my cousin pointed out the lemon ricotta pancakes... Nooooo, I definitely would have ordered those instead had I seen them first.... 8(",

We dropped by for a quick brunch, not knowing how long we were going to spend at Red Rock Canyon. I knew a lot of  people in the area rave about this place so I definitely had to try it out. It was packed to the brim on a Tuesday morning, which shocked me! They have everything from sandwiches to meats to breads and of course everyone's favorite, their pastries. Service was so/so but I would understand because the restaurant was so busy. There are newspapers in the front that look like daily news but it is actually their gigantic menu so it took us awhile for us to decide what we wanted.   I ended up getting their Smoked Turkey with Avocado, Tomato, and Bacon, which only comes in the bigger half pound portions. Be warned because I was expecting a small bite but their sandwiches are huge and is pretty much 1.5x meals for me but there is absolutely no sharing! Their turkey was a little dry but I'm glad they didn't skimp on the amount of turkey they gave. I was surprised that they gave a pickle beside the sandwich because I'm a huge fan of pickles but I only ended up eating half of it because of how salty it was. With the sandwich, you have a choice of a side, which I chose potato salad and it was on the creamier side, which I didn't mind.  Overall, busy staff so don't expect good service but the food makes up for it!",

Everyone seems to brunch here on the weekends, so the wait can be up to 20 minutes. Not a problem, because staring at the dessert case is the best form of entertainment.  My boyfriend and I were seated at the very back of the restaurant, which I don't believe is ideal. I felt like we were left there and forgotten about until staff members came by to ask if they could take our extra chairs, and if they could use our table to hold dirty dishes for a few moments. I didn't mind at first, but this happened several times.  We were both first-time diners, so we didn't know that the menus were the newspapers shoved in between the condiments and the wall. I ordered the spinach and feta omelette with a side of whole wheat toast and a medley of fruit. Water from the feta leaked out from inside the omelette.   Our waitress forgot our corned beef hash, which we looked forward to trying. She took note of our order once again, and disappeared only to return 20 minutes later with our check.   I might return for the sweets, but never again for an actual sit-down meal. So much for that corned beef hash.",

My review is based solely on these, as we did not try the desserts or anything else. Some of the bagels seemed \"fresher\" than others, and if you've ever had a NYC bagel before 8am, you know the expectations I have. I also feel like the bagels were kinda skinny, and the holes were big. I'm used to really fat, chewy but pillowy ones. Sigh.  But it really pains me to give anything lower than 4 stars, as they have a lot of traditional Jewish/NYC deli delicacies, which you really don't see out here in LV. If that is your thing, you really should check it out! The rye bread with caraway seeds looked good. The dessert section also piqued my interest. Please don't get a black & white cookie - Hell will freeze over before anyone ever likes those, trust me.  The shop is located in the weirdest shopping complex - it feels like a dr's office belongs here. Inside, it was pretty poppin' (it was Sunday), but the line wasn't bad.   All in all, I will be back again to try more.",

The inside was huge and I'm glad that a local place like this was so full when I went for a late lunch around 1:30pm. The wait staff was slow but again pretty True to NY style in that part.    The corned beef was very good but not fatty enough for my liking. The pickle eh. The matzo ball soup was quite good - very hearty. I thought the bagel greatly underwhelmed as the place is called Bagel Cafe.   For $11 a meal the price seems high. Yes there's a lot of meat but honestly it's not as much as you'd expect for the price. Usually they are stacked double high (maybe $3-4 more but worthy of two meals). I was full but there was definitely not enough for a second meal. I would give Bagel Cafe a try if you're nostalgic for a NY deli, but don't expect the authentic experience. You'll get a good feeling for the food but not quite there.",

It's my first time there so I decided to try their salad. I have been looking for good Cobb salad so I gave it a try. Then, it took forever again for them to bring the food out. When I saw my plate, I was very disappointed because it's turkey and ham instead of chicken. It always serves with chicken anywhere ere or states I have ever had Cobb salad. So I checked the menu again and they did say ham and turkey but it's on the second line and there's a line in between the other ingredients on the first line. If there's more ingredients to the one order, don't put a line under it to make it like another item. Okay, I missed it so when I mentioned to the waitress, she said I could get chicken but she would have to charge me extra $6 and it would take another 20 minutes. Or she said she could just give me the house salad that comes with chicken. It does not make any sense to me so she would give me a different plate but not switching the ham and turkey to chicken for me. I just ended up taking off the ham and turkey and ate plan salad. On top of it, when I was placing the order, she seemed like she was in a hurry and did not want to take the time to explain a couple of questions that I had. We intended to get some macaroons when we left but I decided not to since I was so disappointed and disgusted by the service. I definitely won't go back ever again.

The pastrami needs to be immortalized on the side of a mountain! The Rueben omelette is a must! It's one of those things that just works! Go here and bring a big appetite cause these portions don't mess around. Don't forget the bakery and get some treats for later!",

I decided on the Bagel and Lox platter and I was not disappointed. It came with tomatoes, onions, olives, cucumbers, pickles, and of course lox. Combined with my Everything Bagel, there was plenty of food to make me full. It was all quality ingredients, good food, and served by a friendly staff! I also bought some cookies on my way out, which I also enjoyed. I'm hoping to make it back for breakfast!",

I expected it to be a lot smaller but it turns out it's more just a cafe with bagels. Lot's of sweet treats, deli selections, and hot plates are also offered. The bagels though, are legit. My go-to spot for sure. I had a pretty good Matza Ball Soup as one of my first selections. Hearty and flavorful, perfect for chilly days.  I also tried the meat kinish and potato pancake - both pretty good BUT not how my mom would make them... Mom's is always better :) My absolute favorite here is the strawberry cheesecake. So damn good! Fresh, fluffy, and not overly sweet - delicious! I have been wanting to try other sweets but it's been hard to not get the cheesecake. It just calls my name!  I did try a jam cookie sandwich with powdered sugar on top and it was pretty good. The one thing I have not been able to catch here is the bialy's. They are always gone by the time I get here :( One day I will try them... I will just have to keep coming back ;)",

There was another place in town that will remain nameless (don't go to Tivoli Village), and they didn't even have the decency to put chicken in their chicken Matzo Ball soup!  These guys don't hold back. They put in everything that should be in there!  You won't find a better Matzo Ball soup for hundreds, if not thousands of miles!",

    "text": "Listen up bagel (and dessert) lovers, this review is for you. I was visiting Vegas and came here with a friend who loves the place. We ended up coming 2, almost 3, mornings in a row because it was SO GOOD.   When we first walked in, my eye was instantly drawn to the massive selection of desserts they have. I'm talking cookies, cupcakes, napoleons, eclairs the size of your face, and more. I wanted it all. Next to that was the bagel selection - there must have been somewhere close to 17 different bagels to choose from, along with a great variety of cream cheese. Too cool. We waited ~10 minutes to be seated and were quickly served water and day old bagel crisps with a sample of their newest cream cheese flavor.   The menu is a little intimidating because it's large and there are many delicious items to choose from. I went for the egg sandwich with avocado on a garlic bagel and it was excellent and super affordable - plus, the side of avocado was basically a whole half of an avocado! The second day I got the same, but went for cheese instead avo (both cost extra) and I got it on the asiago bagel, which I preferred to the garlic. I must say, despite how good the bagels were, the star of this restaurant was the yogurt parfait - it arrived in a huge bowl with so much fruit, my jaw dropped - strawberry, raspberry, mango, bananas, kiwi, and more (see photo). Just wow. For dessert we had chocolate rugulah and it was perfection.   Great service and amazing food. Do yourself a favor and visit this Bagel Cafe!",

Actually the response you gave is a lie.  She was rude and did not answer me. I had to ask two.  Our food was horrible and we had one meal taken off the menu.  The waiter was horrible and we had to ask twice to gave him take back the food and Bring the check.",

A Jewish man with a east coast accent of some kind looked me up and down, smiled, and said, \" You Miss, may sit anywhere you like.\" A lovely way to start a dining experience.  The Bagel Cafe is a traditional Kosher Deli and Diner. The Bagels are very good and the variety is wonderful. There is a large variety of cream cheese to choose from as well. I love the mushroom omelet with Havarti cheese. Sometimes they have a flavored coffee on special, if they do and if it is flavor you like, order it, it never disappoints. They fresh squeeze orange juice all the time. The black and white cookie is perfect. The servers are very good and are always in a good mood.  There are places you find that feel real and not put on. These places make you feel like you are part of something. You are welcome to eat what you like and they are happy to cook for you. The Bagel Cafe is one of those places for me.",

It's a seat yourself venue and for those ordering to go you go up to the deli counter and place your order. Works well enough. Now on to the details  Selections = 5 stars! Holy cow do they have a ton of selections! The bakery alone is something to rejoiced about. Most importantly they carry black and white cookies!!! As a former New Yorker black and white cookies bring back some fond memories. I have not found one place here in Las Vegas that carries them. The same goes for Knishes! I didnt buy them this trip but I have every intention to do so at my next. Again Knishes are one of those that brings back some happy memories and I can never find here in Vegas.  Food = 3 stars Whenever someone tells me this taste just like New York something, I get a little suspcious. Nothing taste like New York anything unless you're in New York, simply put its the water! Bagels are boiled in water, its the water. So, having read reviews and many new yorker transplant raving about the bagels I knew I had to try it. My thoughts? I'm okay with it. It doesn't have that chewiness of the NYC bagel. Its missing this je ne sais quoi. Is it bad? No its delicopis, but its not exciting me and making me dance. I also got the matza ball soup, okay that was good! Can we say hugs the soul? The mataz balls are light and fluffy and savory. Lastly the white and black cookie, it taste like a cake! The frosting was good, but the cookie itself needed maybe 3 minutes more in the oven.   Overall, I'll definitely go back. Need to try all the other goodies.",

I only have ordered take out and tried  almond flavored rugulas, apple flavored rugulas, onion bagels, cinnamon raisin bagels, cinnamon raisin cream cheese, and strawberry cream cheese. I'm going to have to say that the rugulas at first were a bit dry for me. I dont know what they are supposed to be like but they were a bit on the dry end. I lightly toasted them next morning and that made all the difference, so much more flavor when warm, I definitely want more of those. They have a subtle almost heavy hint of their flavor not over powering, and I kinda like that. The bagels were really good, I love soft chewey bagels and would definitely destroy so many of their bagels if I could. The extra cool things are the flavored cream cheeses, they have sweet and savory to go along with their sweet and savory bagels, they are so so good, I need to have more and try more. I was also eyeballing the Tiramisu, while I didn't try anything else this time, there will definitely be more times to try it all, and I definitely wanna try dining in.",

Your coffee is fantastic and they have many options and varieties depending on what you want. For lunch, despite many awesome options, their matzoh ball soup is amazing. Being someone who lived in New York City for many years, my favorite place from matzoh ball soup is second Avenue deli. It was the best that I ever had at a restaurant. This does not stray far from that soup and that's a huge compliment. The location is in a very nice area. The prices are more than reasonable. The service is very friendly. In writing this review, I feel very confident because I have many friends and acquaintances who recommended this restaurant to me and I cannot agree more with them. Outstanding!",

You'd need to install a deterent magnet on yourself (like they have on some shopping carts) to stop you from entering this cafe.    True story: A piece of Black Forest Cake lasted me 5 days. I ate it every morning for breakfast with plain coffee. Kept it in the fridge in the box, covered by a plastic bag with a loosely tied knot. Works perfectly to keep the cake moist. Really good cake, not too sweet; but again it's sugar.  Tried knish for the first time. My best description is they look like food stuffed donuts with a thinner dryer dough. Favored the spinach stuffed one much better. I find it heavy, so eating half made me full. I liked it!  But guess what? You know how you go to the store to get one thing and end up with more than you intended? It may happen to you at this cafe. It totally happened to me, dang. I only meant to try their cannolis. Then I saw the humongous black and white cookie, tiramisu, all sorts of cakes...   Weaknesses. Easily hypnotized by no effort.",

A party of 3 walking in after me gave me a hateful stare as I snatched the small table (able to seat up to 4) for just myself lol.  How dare they? After all I was waiting for one other person to join me.  The friendly staff and waitress made sure I had my coffee right away and took my order at just the right time after I had decided.  When the food arrived I was surprised by the huge portions and the coffee tasted great.  My bacon filled muenster cheese omelet was great but I will say the country potatoes arrived at room temp and I was wishing they were hot.  All in all this was a first pleasant experience for me and I'll definitely be returning when in the area.  When restaurants are busy like this it's a good sign.",

It is still a hidden gem of Vegas with signage that is in no way loud. You enter straight into the deli portion where you can place to go order. Pass this and you can be seated. The seats are still awkward unless you are in a booth - but I am the person who always prefers a booth and I will wait. Over the years I have become increasingly impressed with their Hand Cut Nova 4oz. About $17 it comes with tomatoes, cucumbers, pickles, onions, capers, obviously Nova, and any bagel you like. I recommend it if you like this style of breakfast in general.   I only have two complaints from my visits here. First, the orange juice does not taste \"fresh squeezed\" like they claim on the menu. It tastes watered down. If this is not the case the quality of the oranges must be severely lacking. Additionally, I don't like that you check out at the counter. This normally would not be an issue but it has happened before that after I ate I wanted a to-go order for my friend at home. The waitress said she could not take the order and to order at the register, and the register asked me to order in the deli line, which took ten more minutes than I would have been willing to spend had I known I had to start from scratch to order after I already ate. The deli line is always long, but they do impressively well at making it move.",

Then they served a complementary plate of bagel chips with their homemade I believe it was apple cream cheese absolutely scrumptious. We ordered a pumpernickel and an everything bagel you have to try the nova cream cheese which is the salmon cream cheese. Absolutely delightful. Now I'm a big corn beef and hash as well as home style potatoes girl. But the corn beef hash is legit fresh corn beef not no out of the can mush. And it was very flavorful and UH-Mazing! Huge Portions. Now their sandwiches, fresh deli meat slice to order, and huge and stacked. With the best pickles!! Now don't get me started on their fresh pastries and desserts oh my geez cannolis, black-and-white cookies,  Red velvet cupcakes, and carrot cake. Plus so much more!! You can even take home all different varieties of bagels. The list goes on and on. Wait for it..... they also serve alcohol   Oh yes wine, beer, and Mamosa's I say good day, I said good day",

Honestly ridiculous the waitress however was super sweet about it and did give us 50% for the bagel but honestly I would've rather not had the bagel at all by that point.",

We've now been there for take-out sandwiches a dozen times, and each time we've had the best experience and the most satisfying and delicious food. The sandwiches are piled mile-high, so thick it's hard to get your mouth open wide enough to take a bite! And skimp on meat? Not at The Bagel Cafe. The meat was 4 inches high, and stacked tightly, served on homemade rye bread (utterly delicious--buy a loaf to take home!). Their pastrami and corned beef are the best I've ever had, hands down, anywhere. Don't forget to order the strawberry cream cake -- a \"piece\" is large enough to eat sections of for a week at home. And mouth-watering delicious. We can't speak highly enough of our experience here. We go at least once a week now. What a FIND!",

The latkes are amazing and probably the best place in LV to get them. Pizza bagels are a New Yorkers dream. But the standout item at this place are the HALF MOON COOKIES. I know, I know.

We ordered from the daily specials board and selected eggplant parmesan (only $13.99). This meal came with soup or salad, the entree, a beverage and dessert. To say that the portions were huge would be a gross understatement. I had a very difficult time finishing my meal. You can feed two people with all of the food you get with the meal. We live in the neighborhood of the Bagel Cafe and had been lax in going into there to dine. That will not be the case anymore. The Bagel Cafe is now our \"Go To\" place when we want to dine well for a VERY reasonable price. I HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone.",

I love the butter cookies and the chocolate rugula from the deli. I usually get these to go and enjoy these at home.  The counter is unfriendly though. I always feel rushed and have to put on my big girl pants to get my order. I don't understand why it has to be this way. The waitresses are friendly.

I kept eying my friend's large 1/2 sandwich he ordered which was loaded with meat and I don't think cost more than $15.  For dessert I went for their smaller sized cookie (the large is gigantic) but there is a whole slew of things to pick from at the entrance!!

I ordered 1/2 Salmon Salad sandwich and matzo ball soup. The matzo balls were tiny and the soup didn't taste as flavorful. My spouse ordered a brisket dip, and for the the first time ever he didn't finish his sandwich. He said the meat tasted tiny and rubbery. Little meat flavor and we could tell it was reheated in a microwave. We also ordered desserts to go that were sugar filled with little flavor. We spent the rest of the night sick in the hotel bathroom. I think the amount of attention and pride in the restaurant has significant declined. A local favorite that I continually bragged about became our only disappointment in the trip.",

It seemed like it took awhile for us to get our food.   We ordered the French toast with a side of sausage links. Two eggs with bacon/sliced tomato with everything bagel. The people you sat down long after us order two sandwiches and they got their food quicker than us. The food was great. Eggs were perfect and not just put together real fast. French toast had four huge pieces. I order the everything bagel, it would have been good if they didn't burn the top. The food was great.   The services was just horrible. And not even worth it. When we finished we waited for our server to come with the check and we waited around 15 minutes for her to come. We never got any refills or even check on to make sure things were good. It was hard to even get someone's attention. Three stars for service. Otherwise would have given five. Might go back, but order carry out instead.",

First, parking seems to be at a premium at this location.  Good luck finding parking.    Second, it  took us about 5 minutes to be acknowledged / seated.  They were busy but it was acceptable.  What stood out to me here was how irritated the older folks behind me were getting.  Third, the service - like I said it was busy. Extremely busy.  We did get our drink orders in and our actual orders in quickly after we put our menus down.  Fourth, the food!  The food came out after a 15 minute wait.  My wife ordered the multi-grain pancakes which were HUGE!  I ordered the colorado Omlet with a Raisin Bagel w/ Raisin Cream Cheese.    My wife's multi-grain pancakes smelled AWESOME!  They even tasted very good.  ;)  My Colorado omelet, which consisted of Bell Peppers, Cheese and ham was just \"meh.\"  It was dry and kind of cold by the time I got it.  Nothing to write home about.  What did redeem the meal was the bagel.  Very good!  Over all, the place was clean, the staff was busy but still friendly.  I would come here again to try something else.  It'd have to be after breakfast was over though!",

I had always just stopped to grab bagels for the office for breakfast, but one morning when I was waiting for my order I looked around and the food in the restaurant part looked really good!  We decided to stop by for breakfast and it took a couple of tries before we were able to finally get in as they are busy and you need to get there early.  Both my boyfriend and I had the corned beef hash and eggs and it was delicious!!!  I've been craving it ever since.  I went for dinner a couple of times in the past week and their dinner food is just as great as the breakfast.  I had the beef stroganoff once and the chicken marsala the next time.  The chicken marsala is the best I have had!  So flavorful!  The meal also comes with roasted vegetables that are always really good.  I cna't wait to go back and try other dishes.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in town!",

I felt it was foolish to drive home & only to go back pretty much to the same area.  When I went inside the Restaurant for dinner, I asked if they could put my purchase in their refrig.  They did!  I thought it would spoil while I was eating y dinner.  The next night, Wednesday, I ate some Lox & the Knish.  I got sick from the Knish, it was spoiled.  The consistency of the potato was flaky as to the usually smoothness like mash potato.  So, I happened to be near \"The Bagel Cafe\" on Friday.  I decided to tell them that it was spoiled.  I got an argument from the clerk who told the Manager & he gave me more of an argument.  That they put it out frozen & after 3 days they thrown them away.  They sold out the whole batch & I am the only one that complained that it was spoiled.  What happen to the Customer is always right!  As I was leaving I said, \"under my breathe\" loud enough they could of said, is there anything else we could exchange it for.  The manager must of heard me.  He then said, \"do you want some cake or something\".  And, then I said to him I was not going directly home.  And, then I mentioned about put this package in the other Restaurant Refrig, then he went on another Rant.  You don't know that they did with the package & I said, \"the package came back to me the exact way I gave it to them\".  I just walked out & said, I not coming back\".",

    "text": "New York Style Deli's are a touchy subject with me.  When done right, they are like staring into the face of God and having him smile back you and say \"You are my most precious creation\" but when done wrong, they make me sadder than Pauly Shore's acting career.  The Bagel is in the former category and can easily lay claim to best delicatessen in Las Vegas.  Judge a Jewish deli by five things:  The rye bread, the pastrami, the knish, the sweet & sour cabbage soup and if they sell the black & white cookie.  Alright, that last one might be homage to Seinfeld, but the other 4 will definitely tell you if a Deli is worth it's salt.  The Bagel has them down.  First, the rye bread is fresh and the perfect consistency.  Its got a nice crust and the heels are a perfect complement to any of their soups or sandwiches.  Speaking of soups, their sweet & sour cabbage soup is dynamite.  Chocked full of cabbage and with a simple beef bouillon to absorb the flavors, its a nice lunch on a cold day...to remind you of back home in Jersey.  The pastrami is like butter and practically melts in your mouth and if you want to get fancy, upgrade to a Reuben.  Finally the Knish....where do I began?  You are so good, I'm officially declaring myself on \"a gravy train with knish wheels.\"    So you're probably wondering why no five stars?  Well, the Bagel is excellent but I cant dis the original gangsta deli's like Brent's in LA, Manny's in Chicago or Katz's in New York by putting it on the same level so consider the Bagel 4 1/2 stars as it pays homage to the grand masters.  For Las Vegas however, you can't do any better.    Ohhh, and you're probably wondering why I never even brought up their namesake as well.  Bagels here are good, but bagels are bagels.  They do have an impressive selection and to go is available if you're not dining in.  They also have a bakery that would make my Bubby declare this place \"Meshugganah!\" the portions are so large....",

    "text": "This is my first visit here after a friend told me about it. My office is right down the street and I've driven past it a million times thinking they just served bagels.   We ordered two veggie omelets with potatos and sourdough bread. For drinks we had 1 coffee and 1 hot tea and I also ordered a cinnamon bun to go for my assistant, because I am the best boss ever. Total cost was approx. $33.  Plate presentation was amazing. Everything here seems to be supersized and looks delicious. The 4 pieces of sourdough toast between us was probably a half loaf of bread! Yabba Dabba Doo!  The omelets were very good: Fresh vegetables mixed into the egg and cooked thoroughly... I'm picky when it comes to undercooked eggs. The only criticism I can offer is there was a lack of salt, but there was salt at the table so we added salt to our own to taste.  The potatos were ok. Nothing really exciting about them. My wife asked for no onions in her omelet and when the plate was delivered the potatos had onions.  No biggie.  The restaurant serves as a bakery and deli as well. The bakery side has lots of goodies that look like they are on steroids.  The cinnamon bun is huge and could easily feed three to four people.   Our waitress was friendly and prompt and everyone else in the restaurant looked like they were enjoying  the same level of service.   While slightly pricier than other breakfast spots in the area, it isn't a smokey bar or a chain restaurant, which makes it appealing to me.",

Hostess cupcake:  I did not like the taste of the filling and it seemed like that ratio was also off as far as too much filling and it didn't help disguise the dryness.

I ordered half a sandwich with the soup de jour - cabbage with tuna salad on toasted sourdough.   I expected Cabbage soup like the diet type. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived it was a rich, thick, tomatoey broth, ground beef, and shredded cabbage. The cabbage was tender but still firm enough to have a great texture. It was flavorful. In my own personal opinion, it was just a little too sweet. Sugar offsets the acidity of the tomato base and it is strictly personal preference.  The tuna salad sandwich was, of course, stacked high and offered with lettuce tomato and onion. I ordered it with just lettuce and it came with a huge green Romaine lettuce leaf on top of pleasantly chunky albacore tuna-perfectly toasted sourdough. It had the perfect amount of mayo and was seasoned mildly.   Service was good, even though it was busy. On the way out, I couldn't help but stop at the deli and take home coconut cake and tiramisu!  Both scrumptious.   This place did not disappoint.",

It's entirely possible our server was just awful however he took quite a long time to arrive to take our order, didn't return once for 15 minutes to refill drinks, etc (we had to leverage 2 other waitstaff).  Finally returned to deliver 1/2 of food to table.  10 minutes later we had to ask another server to find him for the rest of our food.  Our sever returns shortly thereafter with food, which isn't ours.  When confronted with the fact that he messed up the order he became enraged, left our table, threw the plate of food in the busser cart with a large crash and audibly announced to everyone that he would not return to our table...all because of his own mistake.  Good riddance to him.  Get new staff, you can't have an attitude like that when you work in the service industry.",

    "text": "I really felt like I was walking into a bagel shop/bakery in New York City.  I was blown away by the selections when I walked into this place.  I don't know what was more impressive... the selection of bagels, the bakery selections with cakes and cookies, or the deli counter with all the authentic meats, fish, and condiments.  And that was just on the selection of items to go.  My suggestion is if you're coming here to eat, come at an \"off\" time.  One of the drawbacks is the parking and the parking lot.  It is in a strip center in which they have parking marked for designated businesses, so be careful where you park.  The other thing is I got there about 11:15 this morning.  And I got here just in time.  The parking area filled up fast, and so did the dining room.  And when I was leaving, there were people circling around trying to find parking spots.  The lady who took my spot, gave me just enough room to let me get out, before she started pulling in.  I took a seat at the counter, because there were only two available tables, and they were for four people, so I didn't want to take up a table for four (although other people alone were).  My server was a very nice young lady, who was very fast .  I ordered an Egg Bagel and a Sun-Dried Tomato Bagel, both with plain cream cheese and a small Black & White Cookie.  It took about ten minutes to get my order, which was fine given how busy they were.  Now, the other big drawback was that the bagels come in single baskets and the cream cheese is on the side.  Trying to spread the cream cheese on to the bagels, while in baskets is a chore, without making a mess.  I would prefer my cream cheese be already on the bagels.  If people want it on the side, they can ask for it that way.  Now, if you've ever been to New York, there are two things you will never get better anywhere else... pizza and bagels.  It's something in the water there that makes both of those things turn out so good.  However, these were the closest bagels I've ever had to real NYC bagels.  They were chewy with a little give, and the cream cheese was whipped perfectly with a great taste.  I enjoyed them both.  The Black & White Cookie was the best I've ever had!  It definitely made the meal complete.  I also had a glass of their Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice, which was awesome.  It was $14 for all of that, which I think was a pretty good deal.  I look forward to eating one of their over-stuffed deli sandwiches next time I go in there.  They looked awesome!   Also want to try their Potato Pancakes!  Definitely a great find and a great place to eat!",

The nova spread with a  garlic bagel is my all time choice along with the mushroom and cheddar omelet which I get \"customized\". Generally there is a wait time but they normally seat before the time they give you, which gives you a chance to browse around their deli and bakery area- from cheesecake to canolis to giant cookies (peanut butter, chocolate chip, m&m just to make a few) to tiramisu, they basically have everything.",

    "text": "I'm updating my review due to the extremely RUDE manager on duty on Easter!   I placed an order for pick up early on Sunday to have picked up at two. I ordered four meals and several pastries from the case. When I was checking out I mentioned that I was to get a side and bagel option with the Benedict I ordered, per their menu online(see picture). Two girls told me no before they asked the manager, Jeremy/Jerry. Who said no but go a head and give it to her, I said thank you. He proceeds to get a menu to point it out. I said ok just to let you know your menu online says that all eggs and omelet dishes come with a choice of sides stated and a bagel. (All in the same section of the Benedict's). He said it comes with an English muffin but I'm not going to make a big deal out of a bagel and that he's never had anyone ask for the bagel. I don't respond because I know better and he agreed to give me the bagel. But I think to myself well I understand that a Benedict comes with an English muffin, I'm not stupid but the menu didn't state a bagel for a substitute. The girl ringing me out said oh the online menu? Well what this guy doesn't know is that I've worked in and managed places very similar to this and I know when a cashier is sympathizing with a customer. They obviously have had this complaint before also by the way he immediately got defensive.   So I pay $75 AND tip (not to mention the $8.25 for a \"large\" side of fruit that was a mere pint) and we leave. As were walking out the door I hear ma'am, like I've forgotten a bag. Ha nope! It's the manager coming outside to argue some more. (My BF said after we left that when he came out the manager said I didn't want to argue with you inside....uhhh how about not at all) He tries to speak but I say to the BF let's go and he starts going on and on and I walk around the BF to walk away and the manager says \"ridiculous\" as he's wailing back in. Ummmm NNO!!! I turn around, open the door and say that was uncalled for and walked away. He comes out again and says next time you can get a bagel instead of the English muffin. Well Manager of the Year, there won't be a next time!!   Ok so! So many things wrong with this!! First of all a manager following me outside to argue with a customer!!! Outside!! Over a bagel!!! You seriously have nothing better to do? I never had time to do that when I was a manager nor was it something I wished to do and seek out. He was so mad about giving me a bagel he steamed over it and still felt he hadn't said enough!   Second, let me inform some of you who might not know...those bagels you pay $2.00 and then some only cost about $.25 to make. Hmmm customer comes to my store spends $75, makes a valid point about what your crappy online menu says, give $.25 bagel to make customer happy. Most restaurant managers know the common sense in that!   I seriously couldn't say enough about this!  Uncalled for. Unprofessional. A frequent customer is now a nonexistent. I'm not happy about refusing to have their pastries!! But not worth giving any more of my money to them!!",

    "text": "Great service, always busy place, but the bagels are too heavy and too much dough. Some people may like it but for those who are on a diet, I have doubts you can lose weight, especially taking 14 bagels for a dozen, which is a great deal. Nice personal, everything would be OK, if these guys would make them less heavy. Maybe I should specially order them, because they do  taste great.",

I told the cashier that I wanted to sit down, and rather than being courteous and finding me a seat, she told me that the tables are for people that order food from a waitress.  Ridiculous!  I guess spending $15 for a sandwich, fries and potato salad isn't enough for me to to sit down at their establishment and enjoy my meal.      I wouldn't recommend this place based on the customer service alone.  I definitely won't be bringing my family or friends.",

My friend got the spinach feta bagel with (I think) scallion cream cheese. She ate hers as fast as I did!  I also shared a slice of the cheesecake with fruit on top with my friend, the cheesecake by itself was soo good, but that fruit stuff was weird. It was this strange, artificial strawberry goop that just tasted unpleasant. However, I would recommend ordering the cheesecake plain!   Come check this place out! The bakery is huge and impressive, so even for the free sniffs, stop on in!",

Cashier : zero personality- no .. Hi! No.. How was everything.. Just zombie taking & processing payments .. No \"thank you\"- & god forbid the smiley mgr guy coaches her to offer some bakery items before departing (they may make some extra revenue on all of those beautiful baked goods yearning to be munched - god forbid)! I'm like f this ill hit trader joes for some cookies instead..   & rewind: btw the \"waitress\" dropped the check w/out offering anything else- did I want a 3-4$ chocolate egg cream after my $35 bagel soup onion ring lunch- hell ya but she dropped the check like ..bounce -so we did",

The only reason I gave this review 2 Stars today is because I dined in and at the end I wanted to order some desserts to go but was told that I had to order from the deli. It feels completely asinine that I would have to go stand in line to order more food while I'm already sitting at a table and eating. This policy is confusing and doesn't make any sense to me.",

    "text": "If you're going here I would suggest going for the bagels or takeout items only. We were seated for 4, it was very busy but our waitress was not as attentive as she should've been.   One person ordered a Reuben and it was super lopsided, one half had all the fixings and the other had none making it difficult to eat.   The salmon Benedict came with poached eggs which were over done and the middle underneath was torn open with salmon which was super salty and the English muffin was barely toasted and overall the dish was lukewarm.   Another person in our party asked the waitress if there was an option to get just a plain bagel with cream cheese and lox (sliced salmon) no capers or tomatoes or anything else needed. She gave a complicated answer and ended up charging him for a platter (includes cucumber, apres, tomato, onion, olives, salmon, bagel and cream cheese) $12 and brought it with only salmon bagel and cream cheese. You can't tell me there wasn't a cheaper and simpler option?   The bagel, cream cheese and lox were great. The service was rushed, in attentive and not personable. So I would only go back for take out bagels or bakery items and wouldn't sit down to eat.",
