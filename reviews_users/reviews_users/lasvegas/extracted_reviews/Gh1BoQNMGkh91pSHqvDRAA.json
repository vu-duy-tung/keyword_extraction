    "text": "There are four Thai Style Noodle House restaurants in Las Vegas. This is the second one. I have to say the place is clean and the food is very good. However, the service has a lot to be desired! When we arrived, the restaurant only had a few patrons. When we sat down we had to wait a bit for our drink orders(no big deal). When our drink and food orders were taken the waiter was not at all friendly. My meal came after about 10 minutes, I was given no extra plate, condiments, or napkins.The waiter then took a seat and finished his meal. My son's meal did not arrive for ten more minutes. Not once were we offered more soda or water. After we finished we asked for the check. The older woman handed it to me with out a thank you or a smile. We have been here several times and these two servers are EXTREMELY RUDE! How pathetic to dislike your job so much. I will not be back, I will just take my business elsewhere!",

Think they need to rename the street to Fort Thai. Anyways, the menu had a lot of choices but the one that stuck out for me was the duck curry. Two of my favorites duck and curry it was a no brainer. It was a really good first choice. Duck was tender and curry excellent with plenty of rice. Portion size wise I felt was perfect. Looking forward to going back and trying something else from the menu.",

I've found this place while driving by and decided on lunch and have been very happy find,as their lunch special are reasonable and a fair selection to chose from.. Sometimes they forget to give lunch menu, if they do ,just ask...I never had to wait to get in,as I have been there at several different times for lunch and brought friends the last time. Fyi I found if you order any noodle dish to go,they will end up clumpy,best to eat them in the restaurant.. I prefer the red curry, and found it very tasty and of course a glass of thai ice tea to cool off the spices,lol.. I did find I prefer this thai place,then the ones around the corner,which are a little more pricey... Service has always been prompt and the only downfall is the napkin holder,which are not really napkin holder,but a small cup and I guess have to ask for any thai compliments for the table? I have yet to try #1,as last time there was a wait to get in and I was hungry and couldn't wait 30 mins...I prefer their 2 items lunch and will go back many times...yummy",

The wife and I got takeout the other night. It's a cute little place... clean, modern, but small. The red curry with chicken that my wife ordered was hot. Very hot... at least for her. She got a level 5 and couldn't finish it because it was so hot. She also ordered extra veggies which cost a dollar. I don't like spicy food so I went with a 2 for my yellow curry chicken dish. Perfect (lack of) heat for me. It was tasty but could have used more chicken. I'd go back to try other dishes.",

    "text": "Came to eat here with my kids the other day, I am very critical of my Thai food since I have been to Thailand and have alot of Thai friends who cook authentic meals for me. Heard really good things about this place from coworkers so I figured I would try it out. I drove pretty far to check out this restaurant since I live on the opposite side of town but it was well worth it. It was a Saturday and I was greeted right away which is always a plus, we sat by the fish tank, it kept the kids occupied for awhile. I ordered the papaya salad, tom yum soup, pad see ewe , and bbq pork. The papaya salad was good but a little too sweet for my taste. Tom yum soup was delicious as well as the bbq pork. My kids liked the pad see ewe but to me it was just ok. I would actually only rate the food 3 1/2 stars but the reason it got 5 was the service was great. Our waiter was very nice and attentive, and he was able to comply to all my special requests (since my kids are picky). it usually is hard to find really good service in Asian restaurants because they usually hire people with no personalities and don't speak that much, and I was happy to have a waiter that could not only conversate and make me laugh but more importantly make my kids happy. It always makes life easier when they know how to handle kids and keep them happy so it makes it easier to enjoy my meal. Definitely will come back and bring my friends, hopefully my expectations will proceed me.",

The good: Great prices (GREAT prices) Good portions (not great) Very good food with wonderfully aromatic and flavorful sauces  The bad: As some other reviewers noted, the chairs need to be cleaned or re-upholstered The place plays like a take out place that coincidentally has tables - as a result the service isn't amazing, its not BAD, but its just not great.  That said, for this price, you can't get amazing service, or the place goes belly up because the economics stop working with that additional server. Staff is friendly and helpful.  The ugly: We ordered vermicelli chicken noodle soup.  The soup was GREAT.  We ordered vermicelli because one of the people in the party had an egg allergy.  We asked when it arrived, and they confirmed it was an egg noodle dish.  They offered to replace it (thank you), but the definition of vermicelli (confirmed with wikipedia) is a rice noodle The Red Snapper tasted more like Tilapia  Look, the food is quite flavorful, and well prepared.  The prices are GREAT.  There are flaws, but we will surely be back.",

This location has been open for a long time now and it still looks like a good environment to dine in. As far as food quality goes the two locations I've been to seem to have the same taste. They have never disappointed me as far as their food, but the real take from this place are the prices. Everything is pretty cheap and they give great portions! My girlfriend and I were able to share an order of pad Thai noodles and beef jerkey. She also got an order of their thai tea. We spent less than $20. I remember I used to get their BBQ combo you find on the back of the menu. It comes with sticky rice and papaya salad. That was always my go to. The servers were welcoming and I can tell they've gotten to know a lot of the regulars there. I forgot how good this place was for a quick thai fix. Definitely will be back.",

I never had the other location but he said this restaurant wasn't bad for having a variety of choice. This location is in the same plaza as Sweet Addiction and where Raw Foods use to be.   --------------------------------------------Food - 5/5--------------------------------------------------- 4 different types of noodles you can choose with your different soup bases. I tried the Beef stew with rice noodle. My friend had the chicken broth with rice noodles and my other friend had Vegan Curry.  The Beef and Chicken broth noodle didn't have much flavor. The broth didn't taste as I expected and wasn't seasoned properly.   ----------------------------------------------Service 4/5------------------------------------------------- The service was standard for a fast food place. It wasn't extremely good but it wasn't bad either. The service was quite fast and when they messed up on my friends order, they automatically took it back and corrected it before serving the food.  --------------------------------------------Cleanliness - 4/5--------------------------------------------- The location was clean front of house. Some of the furniture was worn down and old but it was still clean.   Overall Ok food for good price, fast and decent service. The location was good for a fast dinner   choice that cater to vegan clientele.",

The waitress just looked at him like he was stupid and when he asked the second time she just gave a straight up no and walked away. He bought another one anyway.  What really made this a one star place for me was that when I paid with my credit card and walked outside, to my surprise, the waitress literally CHASED us down the sidewalk demanding to know why we hadn't left a tip. Just to get her to leave us alone she hassled a tip from us, which was 5 dollars and the only cash we had on us at the time. Won't be going back.",

Used to like the pumpkin curry, but last time I ordered it I was only given 1 piece of pumpkin.  Ordered the Mongolian Beef.....won't make that mistake again. They gave me more white rice than actual entree, the beef was overcooked and dry. They loaded up the entree with sliced carrots, which aren't even supposed to be in Mongolian Beef (description says peppers and mushrooms).  My son and husband still love the Pad Thai and their rangoons are pretty good. But, that is about all I can say is good here. They skimp on the veggies, the curry is kindof bland, their larb not good, hot and sour soup also bland. Sorry guys, time to find a new Thai restaurant.",

If you're thinking its like beef pho, it is not. Its much more hearty and savory. I don't know anyone else tried it and disliked it. Its also called a \"boat noodle\". Yum.  The hubby always orders his favorite dish too. The chicken and shrimp silver noodle. Its so refreshing. Light but full of flavor too. I highly recommend this dish as well.

Originally I tried the Chinatown location and loved it so last night I went to this location. It was just as good as the one in Chinatown. I liked the service better at this one.  I ordered the Pad Thai and when she asked what meat I would like I told her I don't eat meat so she asked if I wanted tofu. It was not offered on the menu so I was pleasantly surprised. It's always nice to be offered different options in proteins instead of just settling for no protein at all.   My boyfriend ordered the sliced beef noodle soup with vermicelli. He loved it. He said it was probably one of best soups he's had. The soup had a dark rich colored broth that looked and smelled really good.   We'll be coming here more often!",

    "text": "I finally had a visit to the infamous second TSNH.  Some folks say it doesn't live up to the original.  I am here to say that it does!  This is by far the best Thai restaurant on this side of town.    We ordered the Khua-Kai, the combination Beef Noodle Soup (with glass noodle), and a dish not even offered on the menu.  Every single dish tasted just as good as the other Thai Style Noodle House, which is saying a lot.  Thai food is difficult to cook, and a lot of places have a disparity between the original chef and new chefs.  TSNH2 does not suffer from this hurdle as much as other Las Vegas Thai restaurants have shown in the past.  The Khua-Kai was spot on with the noodles and the sprouts and the homemade sweet and sour sauce.  We quite enjoyed it.  It was a nice balance to the spicier dishes that we ordered.  The combination Beef Noodle Soup is a must try at TSNH, as far as I am concerned.  The broth was just as rich and flavorful as the original location.  Most Thai places use a rather thin broth for this dish, but TSNH uses a thick and creamy beef based broth that cooks all day long.  Its just amazing.  I had this same soup at the original TSNH yesterday, and today at the new location it tasted exactly the same.  Loved it.  Overall, if you live in this part of town, this is the Thai restaurant to go to.  It is the most authentic out of the other spots located in this area, and it just tastes better.  Compared to the original, the interior is much nicer (newer building complex), but you will still see some familiar faces.  Awesome Thai food here!",

Anyways, onto the review:    I was immediately greeted and seated seconds after walking in, then asked what I would like to drink.  I received my water and ordered larb with regular rice, and calamari with sweet sour sauce. Now I loved how much 'meat' you get with the calamari, but I didn't like the sweet and sour sauce paired together. I liked the larb, but not 'in love' with the larb because it was drowned in sauce that it was getting harder to eat towards the bottom of the plate.   Towards the end, I had to stop a server for a box, and normally when one does that you receive a check.  I received my box and put my leftovers away, while waiting for a check.  I waited another minute or two and realized the server was just talking with another server that I had to interrupt her.  Other than that, it wasn't so bad. I'm willing to go back.",

My only gripe is that they don't have Thai chilis in fish sauce as a condiment. It's not the best Thai I've had but satisfies any Thai food craving.  My go to dish is the spicy eggplant with fried tofu. My son loves the pad see ew (spelling?) with chicken. Their pad thai is also good. My husband likes the Penang curry. Their papaya salad I think is the most authentic in Vegas. We've had ginger chicken, steamed snapper, and tom yum goong as well. I think we've had other dishes, but we get the ones over. Oh, that's right the basil chicken.   You can't go wrong. It's tasty.",

    "text": "I may not be the best to read a review from because I order the same thing every single time.  Yellow curry with chicken, no potatoes, no potatoes and extra chicken.   I think it's some of the tastiest yellow curry around.   Plus the prices are very solid (I think my meal is like $8).   Most places are at least a few dollars more for the same thing.  They are weak with the spicy.  When they ask what level of spicy I want from 1 to 10, I always say 20 and tell them I want it really really really hot.   To the point that I'll cry from the heat.   And maybe one out of 8 times it's as insanely spicy as I want it.   It's always tasty though.   As always they give not nearly enough rice as you need (but no Thai place does) so I just make more at home and usually turn my dish into 2 meals.    I usually choose take out but sometimes I eat in.  The service isn't too great.  They get the waters to you pretty quickly and take your order fast but you hardly see them after they bring you your food.   Slacking on the water fill up a little usually but it's all good with me.   I'll go up to the counter if I need something which is slightly inconvenient.    The place is modern and clean on the inside from what I can see (their chinatown location is pretty gross, I wouldn't eat there) but I never got a gander into the kitchen.   I've had the beef pad-see-ew (probably bad spelling) and thought it was a nice portion and tasty.     If they could step up the spicy and have better service Id give them 5 stars.   If you want quality, nice portions, tasty and a respectable price point, give this place a try.",

My FAVORITE was the papaya salad...oh, my, god. I was craving it the next morning and I will definitely be returning to this place. The reason for four stars instead of five was because when we walked in we noticed a sign that said debit card machine was not working. All we had was a debit card so we asked before we sat down. No one had any idea if the machine was back up LOL. All they said was 'i dont know' then walk away. Maybe I was just hangry but that really annoyed me. The food made up for it though.

    "text": "I dont know why I haven't reviewed this place since we've been coming here for about 5 years now. Anyway, to start it off, I'd like to explain that the 1 shy of star from a 4 star is due to the piece of hair i found on my Pad Thai from my to go order today and inconsistent service. The service in this place is almost always bad for both dine in and to go orders. But I wont complain too much since husband and I choose to come back over and over again. It's not the best Thai food we've had in town but it satisfies a good Thai food crave. We come back for the consistency in taste and price. My husband and I probably only cook at home twice a month so the rest of the days, we eat out twice or three times a day even. This place is one of our cheap spots. If you might wonder what's the best Thai food we've had in town so far is my friend's family home cooking lol jk. Im saying, I'm not Thai but have had good home cooked Thai meals so I know what to compare restaurants dishes to. I really like Archie's on Sahara and Fort Apache the best so far. And the worst would have to be Thai Place on Maryland and Flamingo. We've had quite a few different dishes from here over the few years and haven't really been disappointed. We've had some of the Chinese dishes as well, Sweet and Sour and Orange Chicken, etc, but I wont recommend them since...why would I when you're at in Thai restaurant? Kids love them though.  Dishes that we usually order on repeat and highly recommend are: Pad Thai and Papaya Salad of course, Pad See Eu/Ew, Rad Na, Yellow Curry, Panang Curry, Pineapple Curry, Cashew Nuts rice plate, Spicy Basil Leaf rice plate, Grill Salad, and Crab Fried Rice.  Ok dishes: Three Companion, Tom Yum, Khua Kai, Pineapple Fried Rice and Spicy Basil Leaf Fried Rice.  Would not recommend: Pra Ram rice plate did not look nor tasted appetizing at all.  Their menu says Vegetarian options are available upon request on each items on the menu. If you are a True Vegetarian then make sure to ask about fish sauce on the dishes. I am a Pescatarian so I usually order dishes with Tofu (steamed sometimes fried) or sometimes Shrimp. My husband eats chicken and beef. All the dishes I mentioned above are good with all, chicken, beef, shrimp and tofu.  I love spicy food but am not a champ at it and my husband is not a fan. But Thai restaurant spice levels are nothing compared to home cooked Thai spice level. So most patrons should be safe here. I usually order spicy level 7/8 for a good heat and still enjoy or even 10 if I want a challenge since I need to drink lots of water since I didnt the past days lol. I can handle them but my husband's limit is 5.  TSNH 2 location is closest to us since it's on the outskirt of Summerlin South. We've also been to the one in ChiTown and Jones but TSNH 2 is better.",

    "text": "There's a ton of Thai restaurants to choose from, but this place is not too shabby. Service is great, and the food has been good so far.   Appetizer combo platter- 4 star. You can get a taste of the crab rangoon, fried tofu (wasn't a fan), egg rolls (kinda like the plain veggie style at panda), fried shrimp (delicious), chicken satay (amazing). I think it's a nice platter to get a taste and all for $8.95 or so.   Noodle soup with chicken and bean sprouts in chicken broth - 5 star. I got it with flat noodles. Spice level 7. Delicious!  Crispy pork and chinese broccoli- 3 star. The pork tasted a bit off, and it could have been crispier. I've had better, but wasn't too bad.   Spicy seafood fried rice- 4 star.   Pad See Ew- 4 star.  Glass noodle salad- 4.5 star.  It's clear noodles tossed in lime. Delicious!",

I got the green curry which is usually my go to when I eat out at Thai food restaurants and my gf got the pad Thai noodles (she isn't over the top about Thai food) but she loved it! Prices are probably the most reasonable prices here in town compared to the portion of food you get. Right down the street from my house and I guess they have a few throughout town so very convenient I haven't tried the other locations but I'd assume they are all ran the same. Big thumbs up! I highly recommend.",

Waited to order for 20 minutes, even got there attention, but they ignored us and pretended that they didn't hear me. But like I said that's all forgiven, everytime I get Thai food, I go here!",

    "text": "The Ft. Apache location of the Thai Style Noodle House may be the sister to the Chinatown original, but they hail from a different mother.  To be sure, the food is almost as good as it's more popular sibling, but that is no surprise, assuming the recipes got passed along at birth. But that's where the similarities end with this western valley reproduction of a well-loved Chinatown eatery (which is sad news for those of us who live in the western valley).  In my review of the original, I bemoaned the absence of an accommodating server who could provide the suggestions I crave when on a maiden voyage. It is fair to assume the language barrier played a significant role in this, but the server did do an excellent job with everything else - and I had Yelp to help out with the suggestion portion.  The same could not be said for the Ft. Apache location. Not only was there no perceivable language barrier, but, as the only customer during the lunch \"rush\", the server was presented ample opportunity to showcase his skills. It is here where he failed -monumentally.  It's hard to describe the feeling of invisibility, especially if the reader has never experienced such loneliness or felt the overwhelming desire to do a Huckleberry Finn on the fence post. It is especially difficult to imagine being ignored when you are the only customer in the place. Suffice it to say, I nearly had to cry out in anguish EVERY time I needed anything, from placing my order to requesting a refill to procuring the check.  Not only did the server not care about my presence in his establishment, he seemed perturbed by the rare interaction he did have with me. To add insult to massive injury, his response to my credit card was (and I quote) \"Don't you have cash?\" (picture Paris Hilton discovering her rental choices did not include a pink Cadillac Escalade.)  I half expected the bill to arrive in some minimum $25 charge, as some restaurants are wont to threaten with their little placards next to the register.   I was delighted to see that the server only charged my card the exact amount of my bill - it was, sadly, the highlight of my visit.",

They have all the Thai classics and then some, with some nice duck and seafood dishes that aren't on the menu at other places. Their duck dishes are a bit too rich to eat alone, but are so satisfying at the right amounts. The seafood dishes are fresh and speak much to the quality of the fish. There's a bit of an issue with spiciness, though - this is one place that could stand to develop a better spice scale, especially since they excel in other flavor categories as well.  The servers here are friendly and very efficient. They seem happy, which makes the whole establishment seem happy, which makes even the busy nights just more bustling than hectic. Again, a solid, familiar place for just good Thai food.",

    "text": "Thai Style Noodle House was worthy of two visits within a week - lunch specials are a great deal here so we couldn't resist returning!  From 10:30 am to 4 pm, lunch specials are in full swing.  (This applies on weekends too!)    For $5.95, you choose one item from their list and you also get soup of the day, steamed rice, and choice of appetizer (fried tofu, egg roll, or fried wonton).  For only two dollars more ($7.95), you can make it a two item lunch special from their list.  That's a pretty good deal already!  Soup of the day (on both visits) were an egg drop soup that had chunks of goodies in it and fried garlic on top.  A nice start to lunch.    First visit, the Husband had the two item lunch special - Fried Garlic and Pepper Beef and the Panang Chicken with the Fried Tofu appetizer, whereas I had the one item lunch special - Yellow Curry with Tofu with the Fried Wonton appetizer.  With the two item lunch special, we thought they would give him less of each, but it was actually two full regular lunch portions.  Definitely a great deal!  They even asked if I wanted soft or fried tofu for my entree choice.  My curry was loaded with lots of veggies - carrots, string beans, bamboo shoots, napa cabbage, and baby corn.  All their entrees were good and tasty and we were both pleased with our choices.    On our second visit, we both got the one item lunch - the Husband stayed with his Fried Garlic and Pepper Beef Choice with the Fried Wonton appetizer while I had the Panang with Tofu with Fried Eggroll appetizer.  They did get our spices mixed up on this visit though.  I requested medium while the Husband asked for spicy.  His has no spice while mine had all the heat.  It was still good nonetheless.  Be sure to ask for the Thai condiments - sometimes they automatically give it to you while other times you have to ask for it.  Their version of Thai iced tea is pretty good and a steal at $1.75.  Service is fine - both times we went was after the lunch rush so we were attended to as needed.  Overall, Thai Style Noodle House ranks up higher than some of the other Thai restaurants in the area offering lunch specials.  Minimum $15 for credit card use.",

I saw the dude cooking on the wok sneeze in to his hand, then continue cooking. I asked the waitress and she said, \"no he did not\" ... OK ... gross.  Then here ... previously, cheap and decent Thai food.  Until this week. Ordered food ... it came, the pot sticklers which are usually excellent were dripping grease and covered/swimming in sauce. Not a good start. The soup and salad came, and so did a little friend walking across the floor.  Actually not so little. A roach in the middle of the dining room. When I went to the manager/cashier about it, she said they have no problems - they spray all the time. I said then what about the roach in the middle of the restaurant, she said it must have come from outside. (After leaving the business, not one roach, anywhere.) I find this very hard to believe when on previous experience I had health concerns with their other location - in fact, I just learned the other location was temporarily closed by the Southern Nevada Health District last month. I think it is time for an inspection of this location as well.  For what it is worth, I offered to pay, I kept asking how much do I owe you - I kept asking, again, kept asking - yet she was on a very long conversation in Thai (I assume with an owner) about the roach issue. She did not make me pay, which in all honesty is what should have been offered in the beginning, since we did not eat and we were interrupted by pests.",

Thai chicken skewers were fantastic. Edamame was lightly salted and wonderful  Me had chicken curry and chicken pad Thai. Loved them both. We could have shared either dish because the portion size was nice. Not crazy large but a healthy portion.   Although we didn't partake in desert they had a nice menu. Price was perfect.

I rushed to Archie's since I LOVE their basil fried rice. It's amazing, but sadly they were closed. There are a bunch of Thai restaurants in this area, but this was the only name I remembered, so I decided to try it. I ordered Pork Pad Thai and Chicken fried rice. I ordered take out and my food came out pretty quickly. The service wasn't that great. Typically whenever I order to go, other places always offer me water, this place did not. They also did not offer me a place to sit. I just sat down. Maybe I just have different expectations?   Their Pad Thai was weird. It was very dark and kind of clumpy. It wasn't horrible, but not the best I've ever had. My friend had Thai food from Weera Thai, and their Pad Thai was a lot lighter. I normally don't order Pad Thai, but I was starving and for some strange reason I wanted Pad Thai. The fried rice was pretty good. It just wasn't the same as I was looking for. I ordered a spice level of 7/10, and none of the dishes were spicy at all. I was worried that 7 would be too spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all! It was kind of disappointing, actually.",

The broth for the soup was a little sweet for me, but it was very good, especially after I added the spicy condiments ;)   The Pineapple fried rice was just as awesome as at the other location.   I had saved room for dessert & was looking forward to some fried banana with ice cream & honey, but alas, they were all out of bananas :(   This location is probably as small as the other one, maybe slightly bigger. Very clean & friendly staff.   I would definitely come back ;)",

Going into a Thai restaurant I always tell myself, \"The service is going to be bad, but that's okay.. I am here for the food\" and that's exactly how this restaurant was. Great food, bad service.   My wife and I ordered a well received yelp favorite here, the Pineapple Fried Rice, which was FANTASTIC! Throughout the fried rice were cashews and pineapple chunks which added such a distinctive brightness to the rice. The dish was flawless. I would go here again and again just for that rice alone.  We also ordered the Sliced Beef and Vermicelli Noodle Soup with Bok Choy. This was a perfect entree for this cold fall night. It warmed you right up with subtle flavors of cilantro and bean sprouts in a delicious beef broth. The beef came out at a perfect temp and was very tender. They definitely don't skimp out of flavors and ingredients. My family and I will def be back soon to enjoy another warm winter favorite!",

Pad Thai was fairly Americanized, but good. Curry duck was very good, calamari was a small portion and very rubbery. Coconut soup was over powered by excessive accents of lemon grass, which is too tough to eat, and had something that had the smell of cedar, texture of cedar, and looked like expired ginger root. I wouldn't recommend it (#19). The fried ice cream was a small portion, but not bad... pretty typical. There's several Thai restaurants nearby with similar pricing and fresher food. I will not be back.",

The consensus between friends is that this place deserves 1 star because the food doesn't come anywhere close to our favorite spot.  And the service was lack luster.

Only complaint was there was something hard in it. I think it was bamboo but whatever it was it wasn't edible. My wife had the curry chicken and I had the Thai spicy noodle. Funny story, my wife doesn't like real hot food, so she told them a \"2\" on the spice level, I love spicy so I said medium spice. My wife's food was so hot she was pink and sweating, while mine had a hint of spice but was not hot at all. Both were very good, we'll definitely go back, but be careful on the spice level, not sure how they interpret what you tell them. I washed it down with a couple Thai iced teas and they were fabulous. Service was good, prices very reasonable",

    "text": "Being a huge fan of Thai cuisine I was looking forward to trying Thai Style Noodle house.   I unfortunately was not impressed at all. My order consisted of chicken satay, crab Rangoon and pad Thai chicken spicy.   The chicken satay was made of chicken that had the texture of cardboard and was bland. The peanut sauce didn't do the satay any favors either. The crab Rangoon was ok, nothing special about it nor can I say it wasn't good. The sweat and sour sauce that came with it was watery. The main dish, the pad Thai chicken was mediocre. There is a distinct difference in pad Thai from a Chinese restaurant and pad Thai noodles from an authentic Thai restaurant, these favored Chinese, which was very disappointing. The spicy was rather weak and the chicken in the dish also had a cardboard taste.  Unfortunately, I would not return nor recommend this restaurant. On a positive, the host and server was very friendly!",

They are not the regular \"dip in sauce\" gyozas. They have sauce drizzled over the top of them and it just makes the whole meal!   We had it delivered for the first time tonight and my mans exact words were \"he loves his job!\" The delivery driver was happy and got the food to us in great condition! Warm and all in place! We love the Thai House!!!",

My roomie ordered the spicy basil fried rice with beef. The Hot and Sour soup was not as flavorful as I had thought it would be. It was definitely sour, though. The soup comes with multiple meats but my favorites were the ground chicken and pork (everything else was eh). I'm giving this place 4 stars because I ended up enjoying my roomie's fried rice more than I liked my own meal.   Maybe next time I'll try something different. Will come back with hopes to be proven wrong about future dishes.",

It was really good, especially the potatoes in it. It was almost if they baked these pieces and then put them in the curry. They were different and tasty. I also got Som Tum and pork. This was just OK, especially the meat, which was a bit on the dry side and tasting slightly like liver. It came with two sauces and I preferred the one with vinegar rather than the sweet one although I'm not a big fan of vinegary tastes. The sticky rice that came with it was bad. It came in a bamboo container, I guess, to keep it moist. However, it was so tough, especially around the edges, that I didn't like it. I don't think it was supposed to be like this and that it was overcooked. I also didn't care for the bean-sprout type of salad. I'm not a fan of bean sprouts or having peanuts used in foods.",

Everything is dirt cheap and addictive.  I can say that dollar for dollar, this place makes the best Thai style steak salad in America. Is that too bold of a statement? Maybe. But for under $8, nothing can taste more amazing.  See, I'm in a good mood so I wrote a 5 star review, but like any restaurant you visit frequently enough, consistency can be their downfall. 4-5 stars based on the chef working there that day.  Another thing to point out is the level of spiciness 1-10.  But that's not their fault, it's our fickle diners. That's why I vote for a Universal Spiciness Barometer.  We need Thai style reform.

Though it isn't the best Thai food I've ever had, it's enough to satisfy any pesky cravings and in my humble opinion they have the best sticky rice and mango dessert. I'm a sucker for those things so I always order it no matter which Thai place I go to. It is not a complicated dessert and I've even made it myself a few times before but there's something about TSNH's version that makes it irresistibly good and so hard to stay away from. Another favorite is the Tom Kah Kai, it's a delicious soup with your choice of meat, it has mushrooms, lemon grass, tomato and has a coconut milk base. It's sooo good and depending on your heat tolerance they can customize the spiciness. It goes for most of their dishes like any other restaurant would. The pad thai is worth ordering as well. The kids really enjoyed their orange chicken and the hubby likes the fried rice with a side order of fried chicken. I have yet to try their curry but I'm confident I'll enjoy it like I do the rest of their offerings.",

We made our usual selections, started with a yellow curry.  Chicken, the pieces were tender, the veggies, onion, potato, bell pepper, cut just the right size, and the curry, not to overwhelming with coconut milk, pretty good.   I love eggplant and to please me, we ordered the spicy eggplant.  The eggplant is sauteed and is cooked well, there is a little hint of basil and thai chile, so not too spicy.    And finally we got a noodle, I don't remember the name, it was a flat Noodle and came with chicken, egg, green onion and bean sprouts.  it was good.",

It's hard to find a good Thai place that cooks their food like my moms style but here they do and I struck gold because my mom now lives in Tennessee so this was the best substitute.   Every time I come here I want to order everything on the menu but always get the Crispy Pork belly fat with Chinese broccoli about $8.95 plus a single side of rice. Their 3 companion dish hits close to home with the BBQ pork, papaya salad and sticky rice is perfect and reminds me of what my mom would make all the time. A lot of their other dishes are absolutely delicious and the dessert sound and looks amazing I yet have to try that.   Food is amazing, price is awesome and restaurant is clean and quaint. The staff is also very nice. I would return to the place everyday of I could. If you haven't been here you must do just that because you will be hook at first bite.",

First time having my favorite Glass noodle salad here but it was overly salty and had barely any noodles, mostly cilantro, onions and romaine. This dish is bigger AND better at Panna down the street. Our waitress was rushing us to order even though there was only one other table. Then our main dishes came out separately so two of us were eating while the others were still sitting 20 mins without food. We asked to cancel the orders because it was taking too long and we had to get back. The waitress kept telling us the food was almost ready but we'd lost our appetite and our time at this point. She was quick to take our payment however. Smh.",

There was 2 other tables in the restaurant when we arrived. When we sat down they gave us 2 minutes to look at the menu and asked if we were ready and we asked for another minute. An older lady approached us twice after that asking if were ready and the second time around she said kitchen is closing so we have to order. We ordered 2 apps and 2 entrees. Entrees came out first and then the apps. You could tell they were rushing. After we got all the food they immediately dropped the check. She made a comment \"take your time\" so we tried to finish eating and they kept stopping by to see if the check was ready. When my boyfriend gave her his card she dropped the check back off and said \"sign it so I can close it out.\" Overall the food was good but the service was rude. 7/1 dine in date & there was 1 older & 1 younger woman working. Should close at 9:30 if you're going to rush the kitchen but you say you close at 10.",

The pad se ew had good flavor but the noodles were not wide the pork was tough.  I prefer the food at the corner Thai kitchen around the corner on trop.

They have a lunch menu and a vegetarian/vegan menu. I choose the vegetarian menu. So much to choose from. Soups and salads, rice and noodle dishes. I got the spicy basil noodle. I asked for extra broccoli and extra thai basil. I also got a thai iced tea. I'm not usually a fan but the past 2 times I went out I ordered the thai tea and enjoyed it. The dish was good. I happen to like Pan Asian's a little better. PA's has some sort of Thai spice on the dish that is wonderul. I dont know what it is though. I'm going to come back and try a few other things. Id like to try the pineapple rice and the yellow curry. The service was good, although it did seem to take quite a bit for my meal to come out. It was hot and delicious though, and that's important. The price was A-OK for me too!",

I'd highly recommend their soups. easy substitute for Pho for those days when you're craving something hot and delicious and possibly help with your hangover or get over a cold.",

We had duck noodle soup (I didn't get a taste, my daughter became quite defensive after her first bite), orange chicken and red curry with pumpkin and chicken.  Orange chicken was the bomb!  Tangy, crispy, and light - the breading enhanced the flavor rather than acting as filler.  Red curry was marvelous, with carrots, green pepper and basil.  I've had a lot of Thai curries and this was one of the better ones - light on the coconut milk, nice variety of textures and flavor.  I ordered it medium hot which was right for me and I eat spicy food.  I suspect the hot would be very hot.  Only criticisms are that the orange chicken was simply chicken and rice, it would have been nice to see a bit of garnish with carrot.  And they didn't offer condiments, which I suspect we could have gotten if we'd asked, but the food didn't need it.",

It was a large order with tons of food and all in all didn't take too long time come out. We got the shrimp avocado panang and pad see yew. The curry was pretty good! It also comes with rice so you didn't have to order a side. The pad see yew was a little too sweet for my liking, but still good. Their scale is interesting because it goes from 1 to 10. Pictures really sold us on the sticky rice with mango. I'm also a big fan of fried ice cream so I had to get that too. Both were quite good and I was glad I got both. The mango isn't quite in season but it was still tasty. The warm sticky rice was delicious! If I came back, I'd get the duck fried rice. Our friend had that and it was really really good. Overall, a really nice visit! Plus the prices were really cheap compared to places back home.",

I've always liked their orange chicken and typically order it, it's lightly fried, crispy white meat with no nasty gristly parts like most Chinese/Thai places have. It may have just been an off night, but I ordered the chicken and it seemed like the regular kitchen staff took the night off and hired Stevie Wonder to stand in. The chicken was chewy, tough and even looked completely different that I was used to. Small, dry pieces. It was pretty gross. Even the chicken noodle soup was off, it wasn't as taste as it usually is. I was turned off after that, I tossed the food and probably won't be back. There's a million Thai places with good reviews in Vegas, time to change it up.",

And while I may opt for all the standard staple Thai dishes, I can also be very picky about them... and I was very impressed that they are all done very well at this 4 locationed restaurant throughout Las Vegas (Chinatown, Fort Apache, Rampart & S. Jones)!  RECOMMEND:  - TOFU PAD THAI: Stir fried small rice noodles with egg, ground peanuts, bean sprouts in pad thai sauce. (I ordinarily would order this with chicken, if I could eat meat!) - SHRIMP YELLOW CURRY: Coconut milk mixed with white onions, bell peppers, tomatoes & potatoes, with side of white rice.  - SHRIMP PAD SEW: Stir fried flat rice noodles and egg with broccoli in sweet black soy sauce. (I usually prefer this dish with beef, but like I said, lent no meat fridays!) - SEAFOOD WONTON SOUP: Wonton soup with seafood and yoo choy in clear broth. Add noodles to it for $0.75!   Everything extremely satisfactory and hit the spot! Service was good, venue was nice, and the portions were filling! New to the southwest area and I think we officially found our go-to Thai place! :)",

Since my family and I were right next door at Makai this passed Saturday, I decided to give this place a try again in hopes that their service have gotten better. I called in for a to go and placed an order for a beef Rad Na and Thai tea to bring next door and eat it with my family. The man who and took my order and checked me out at pick up was nice. He also wasnt bitter when I asked for two jalapeno peppers (unlike the passed visits -even when I give a tip). I was almost excited thinking the service may have gotten better and that I can start ordering here again. But when I was half way done with my dinner, I found a piece of  hair in my noodle box. I think that was a sign I should stop hoping this place would get better for me.

I mentioned dryness and grossness but still left with a additional charge for nasty tofu.  The pineapple rice was sticky and had only 1.5 shrimps and 1 pineapple cube.  Someone was is being stingy and extra picky in the kitchen.  Won't return on the basis that they had no bright ideas on satisfying a customer.",

For dessert, we had the sticky rice with mango and that is really good.   The service is pretty fast, and the servers are attentive.    Prices are reasonable. Convenient location. Ample parking.   They may need to refurb the chairs as they have so much stains we were scared to sit on it. Other than this, pretty good Thai restaurant.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas looking for a place to live and I hadn't eaten all day long. I was feeling for Thai food and happened upon this place. It is very unassuming, but inviting. I decided to have the Chicken Pad Thai and I asked for it to be  level spicy. The woman was skeptical but I assured her that as an island woman, I could take anything that she dished out.   The meal arrived after about 10 minutes, which was not too long to wait for someone eating alone. The portion was large enough that I could have split it into two if I wanted, always a plus. The pad Thai? It was fantastic. The seasoning, combined with the heat was just an explosion in my mouth! Definitely brought a smile to my face. The waiter kept staring at me to see if I could actually take the heat and I did! Ate every bite.  The only reason that I'm not giving the place a 5 star rating is because I thought there could be a bit more chicken, but the overall flavor more than made up for it. Oh and the meal was super affordable at $7.50.  This place will definitely be seeing me again when I move to Vegas!",

There were quite a few people in here and their bowls looked amazing. Looks like we made a great decision. Drink orders quickly taken (I LIKE THIS). We then looked over menu and decided on shrimp rolls as an appetizer. Very good choice on this nicely rolled flavorful and crunchy. Josie got the Chicken Noodle Soup minus the Tofu. I ordered the Roasted Duck Noodle Soup. They bring the spice on the side so you can heat it as you please. The duck soup had a salty earthy flavor I added to small spoon fulls of the Thai spice in the bowl they gave me. That added the bit of heat I needed and wanted. Josie enjoyed the Chicken Noodle said it filled her and warmed her on a brisk day in wintery Vegas.   Everything here was on point. Service was excellent food was amazing. We will be back for the other Thai selections on this menu. If you are in area please try it you will not be disappointed.",

I used to go to Archi's for thai food but after discovering Thai Style Noodle House, I have not stepped foot in the former. It's also a plus that this place is right next to my house. There is another Thai Style Noodle House location in chinatown but this one is about a 5-7 minute drive from my house. The portions are pretty generous for Thai food. If you eat a lot of Thai food, you'll know that the servings area always tiny. This place is the total opposite. The plates are always full and very affordable. ~$50 could feed my whole family (4) with left overs. Another reason I love this place is because it's very family oriented. Everyone here is really nice and they're always coming around to make sure everything is alright even though it's always packed when I go. It's nice to see how attentive they are, especially since their staff is very small.  My favorite dish here is the Pad See Eu with beef. MMM. I am salivating just thinking about it! A second favorite is the spicy eggplant with tofu. I usually get the spice level at a medium so it's not too overpowering. The duck fried rice is a good option too! Oh and don't forget the squid salad, potstickers, and last but not least... the mango sticky rice! It is absolutely AMAZING!! I could go on and on about the different food items that I love here. The only thing i wasn't a fan of here was their thai iced coffee and thai iced tea. They were good but a little too sweet for my taste. Not a big deal though. I can't wait to come back here for a feast!  Oh yeah, they also do delivery but I believe it's only within a 3 mile radius.",

Delivery is very timely and the people are friendly over the telephone.  Our order was well packaged and came to the house hot and fresh.  I have tried number of the dishes here and never been disappointed.  The drunken noodles with seafood combination is a spicy and savory dish that hits the spot.  I am a big fan of the curries here.  The red curry with seafood combination and the duck curry are excellent as well.  The soups are very delicious and sooth the body well if one is feeling sick or under the weather.  The spice level is appropriate as to what we have requested.  This has consistently been a good delivery food experience.  I look forward to visiting the restaurant in person soon.",

The soup comes with fish cakes, pieces of pork loin, garlic chips, cilantro and bean sprouts.Both dishes were so good!! Highly recommend this place. The Pad See Ew is excellent, and  the combination beef soup is tasty and full of flavor because they use three different kinds of beef. The broth is probably made with beef bones but is really heavy broth. I have yet to try the Tom Yum Soup noodle. Thai ice tea one of the best I've tried. Excellent customer service and pleasant servers.  Place is about to celebrate its first anniversay next week. They do a lot of take out orders and free delivery if you live less than 3 miles. Will be here every week for sure since we live close by.",

    "text": "So my wife and I are big fans of the Thai Style Noodle House in Chinatown.  We just recently saw that there is one in our neighborhood.  In fact, it's five minutes away, ON THE SAME STREET!!! We were very excited, and decided on night to have some delivered.  That was mistake number 1 for us.  They said that it would be 25-30 minutes.  After 45 minutes, I called them and they said that the driver was just now leaving.  15 minutes later, the driver calls me and says he cannot find our apartment complex.  I told him exactly how to get to our place from the restaurant, and he tells me it's not right.  So after a little back and forth, I finally convince him that I know what I'm talking about, and he's on his way.  15 minutes later, he cannot find our apartment building, blah blah blah.  To top it all off, they didn't even get our order correct.  Long story short, I wouldn't order delivery from them again, but I would go pick up takeout.",

    "text": "So I was very disappointed with TSNH especially when it had a 4 star rating.  But then again I noticed other having missed opinions about this place also.  I didn't have high expectations going in, since this was Plan B for dinner, so that's probably the only reason why I didn't give them a 1.  First off there was something wrong with the service, I don't know, it was the most MEH experience I've ever had.  The lady who served us only smiled once and this was when it was time to pay, as if she was only happy to see money. We all ordered water maybe that added to why we got that service.  The food we also received were complete opposites from what I've seen on the pics and what was described in the reviews.  One of the dish we ordered was the yellow curry.  The flavor in the curry was decent but there were very little ingredients.  It was mostly sauce and it was very watery.  Another dish we ordered was the chow mein, the noodles were dry and it was all very salty. And another was the fried chicken, HORRIBLE don't ever order this, it was rubbery and tiny like microwaved chicken.  I don't know maybe I went on bad night or they just sensed that this was my Plan B for dinner.  I probably won't be back.",

That was also good although lacked any spice and some salt.. We asked for medium . We also got the beef larb. I ve eaten quite a bit of this dish at many Thai places and I also used to work at a Thai rest. Their larb is nothin. Like anything it's suppose to be. Maybe they forgot how to make it that night? It was just chopped up big chunks of beef . With some lemon juice. No mint no rice powder nothing . And mind u they threw so much red pepper flakes in it that I know for a fact they over spiced it . It had red all over . But they didn't correct it. Poor customer service on their end . I just didn't eat it.  The good : prices.  The bad: service and quality .",

It's not my favorite Thai place in Las Vegas, but that doesn't stop me from frequenting this place.  Their curry selection is pretty cool.  They've got avocados and pumpkin in their curries, which reminds me of Pan Asia.  I've also sampled the pad thai and a yummy noodle dish that has chicken, tofu, shrimp, squid, and just a bit of everything in it.  Their garlic pork is very flavorful, and their spice levels are right on point.  I kept hearing about this beef jerky that they have, but I didn't like it.  Really tough and burnt.  The service is quick and friendly.  I definitely recommend this place to my Yelp friends!",

There weren't many slices of duck in this curry.  It did came with a side of white rice. -Mango sticky rice:  I ordered two of these.  The sticky rice was yummy and it was covered with coconut milk.  It came with half of a \"not in season\" mango.   But for the price of $3.95 each, it was still a steal. -Thai tea:  quite strong.  I enjoyed the tea very much.

If you've never had it before its like a seared noodle dish with egg, served with a Thai sweet chili sauce. LOVE IT!   Three Companion: The pork had a charred, barbecue flavor, it was a little chewy, but it's pork.  Panang Avocado Curry: This used to be my favorite menu item, (I've ordered this about 20 times) but sadly something has changed either with the quality of the Salmon or the preparation of it. I would not recommend ordering it. The salmon is consistently bad quality or dry tasting.  I asked and they said there was no change. Tried it three more times before finally giving up on it.  [DECOR] I love the decor here. It's a very small cozy restaurant, there is this amazing faux tin ceiling which is my favorite thing about the decor here. I find myself looking up. I like that they pay Thai television here too. The walls have are half stone. Very beautiful in a casual environment.  [PRICE] Very good pricing. Main dishes are $7-$9 and very filing. :)  [SERVICE] Everyone is very sweet and friendly here :)",

The BBQ Pork was thrown on top a pile of rice.  There was no pretty cucumber and carrot garnish.  The rice was not arranged in an appealing shape.  I'm a very visual person and I like to have food that looks good.  The service was almost non-existant.

I had the Pineapple Curry Shrimp, but substituted the shrimp with chicken instead, which they had no issue with. My boyfriend had the Panang Curry. We also had the Chicken Satay and the Pad Thai with Beef to share. All of which was very tasteful. My only issue was they don't give nearly as much rice as I hoped they would. But, maybe that's just the Asian in me, ha.   The service, however, was subpar. It wasn't very busy when we got there - maybe three other tables. Our first waitress was nice, but quiet. Which isn't really an issue. She took our order for food and drinks and that was that. The second waitress who brought our food out, wasn't very welcoming - sort of had a \"I don't really care\" attitude. She gave my plate to my bf's brother, even after I said it was mine and vice versa. We also didn't get our drinks, until we asked again, and when the waitress brought them out, she swapped them around again. No big deal, but there were only three of us at the table.   Anyway, I'd come back for the food for sure, but definitely not for the service.",

We asked them to clean the table twice and it was still first.  Bathrooms were nasty, floors were sticky. Food was ok for the price. We will not be going back though and we would not recommend this place. I have it 2 stars because price and taste.",

    "text": "I have literally been going to Thai Noodle House for years.  I have been to all of their locations many times.  In the past several months,  there have been weeks when I have gone multiple times.  Sadly to say because of the rude service I received from a bald server with glasses,  I will not be going to any of their locations again   We got there 02/02 at 11:57 am.  I had tried calling about 10 minutes before arriving for a takeout order.  First time,  no one answered.  Second time after at least 5 rings, an answer but told me to hold.  After three minutes no one got back on the line so I just hung up since I would be arriving shortly.   When I got there I immediately gave my order to the bald server since I didn't need a menu.  At this point there were two tables in the restaurant.  One with 3 people and one with 5 people.  Also there were two take outs being worked on I could see the orders on a wall clip.  There were two servers.   After a few minutes my kids and I walked outside to check out the other stores.  Then we came back and stood by the counter.  I think my kids blocked the bald server's way since he was walking back to the kitchen and said that the food was not ready and we could have a seat.   (Although he could have just walked around a table to get to the kitchen. ) My kids just sat down and I said \"oops sorry\".  At about 12:13, to go food came out from the kitchen which could have been ours.  The bald server was doing something else at the counter so he didn't check on the food that just came out. At this time another customer came in to pick up his order.  The bald server explained it wasn't ready.   Instead of working on the takeouts so they wouldn't get cold,  he then chose to ask the customer who just came in,  to pay for the order that wasn't yet ready.  Then he checked on the food that came out.    As he was doing this,  I could see that only one of the dishes was ours...a noodle soup dish that had beenawwww sitting there.  A few minutes later I saw our first come out.  He was busy doing something so I just asked,  \"Excuse me,  I think that's our order.\"  He looked at me,  turned around to look at the food,  turned to me half smirked and didn't say anything.  A couple minutes later he went and got our second dish. When he was bagging the items,  he did ask if I wanted any chili.  I responded, some crushed chili please.  He then dropped a small container and lid on the counter, without saying anything.  I asked,  am I supposed to get the chili myself?  Without hearing his answer,  i walked to a table and put chili in the container.  Really put a bad taste in my mouth.   My parents were in the restaurant business for over 25 years,  I also worked in their restaurant having done everything from washing dishes to waiting tables to managing. I know that it's hard work and you can have a bad day.  However,  keep in mind it's a service business.  If you are going to have that type of attitude, just get another job.",

Anyway she has bad attitude, if I don't give tips and ask for hot sauce to go I can feel that her attitude changes to very unpleasant mode.. You see this is Not Right..

I ordered the chicken skewers, tum yum soup, pad thai, and duck fried rice. The chicken skewers (#10 on the menu) were good, above average. I enjoyed eating it with the peanut sauce. The tum yum soup was also above average. I would of liked it with some rice, I liked it but wasn't blown away. I'm a big fan of pad thai but was unimpressed with the dish here. It wasn't bad but I had better at random Thai restaurants. The duck fried rice was delicious and my favorite dish of the night. Definitely a must try. Overall, I had a good dinner and was happy to try this place. I definitely recommend trying it once.",

    "text": "I can understand why this is highly rated. The food was very delicious. I ordered a vegetable egg roll (which I didn't think was exciting enough to photograph) and their roasted duck curry with steamed rice. Their portions were okay. I honestly expected more since it wasn't a lunch special order. It was a regular dinner size, made to share, order. And if I were sharing that with my family, boyfriend, or friends, that wouldn't satisfy anyone. Also, I ordered a spicy level of 7 (I'm a huge fan of spicy foods, and my go-to level is a 10, but I wanted to take it easy and just chill for the day), but that was not a 7 at all. It was like a 2. My boyfriend can't really handle spicy foods, and he said it wasn't bad. So that was a bit disappointing for me. The rice was good. It wasn't that typical hard rice in most Asian restaurants. Theirs was softer and a bit more moist. Although the food was delicious, I was disappointed by the portion and the spice level. Another reason why I decided to give them 3 stars is cause of the service. Asian restaurants typically have bad service, but it was annoying how they took a while to serve the food, even though it's been sitting out on the counter for a few minutes. Also, there was really only one server while we were there. And for a busy lunch, that's a no-no. The best thing about this place though is the cheap price. It's about $1-$2 cheaper than other Thai restaurants (eg. Archi's). The foods were delicious, no doubt. I'm just really picky when it comes to service and spice levels.",

It was very greasy with a very strong vinegar taste as well. I took one bite of the beef and wanted to vomit. I couldn't bear swallowing it. It tasted rotten. Instead of sending it back we paid for it and threw it away as soon as we walked outside. Don't waste your money. Definitely the worst Pad Thai ever!!!!",

    "text": "This was my first time coming to this restaurant. It's located in the same plaza as Sweet Addictions, right across from iHOP. Came here because a friend wanted to try it out, overall experience wasn't that bad at all.   We decided to do it family style and get three dishes that we would all share. First up was the Papaya Salad, I've never had it before this, but it was good. Nothing too notable, papaya, carrots, peppers, tomato, and cabbage with a sauce that I can't really describe the taste (gotta try it again). I think we ordered a 6 as far as the spicy level goes, it wasn't overly spicy but you can definitely tell it was spicy. I think I was expecting something different as far as how spicy this was going to be, so it caught me a little off guard.   We got a Green Curry Fried Rice with chicken, also level 6 spicy. This was pretty good, none of us have had it before so we weren't sure what to expect, but it's literally the green curry flavoring cooked into their fried rice. It wasn't overly powering, but you can definitely taste the green curry along with our choice level of spiciness. It contained the chicken, green bean, bean sprout, and carrots, don't recall if there was anything else in it. It wasn't dry at all, which was good, they didn't over cook it!   And lastly we got the Choo Chee Salmon, which none of us have had but heard good things about. So this was the best thing out of all the dishes we ordered. I really enjoyed the sauce, which was semi sweet. I'll need to try it a few more times before I can figure out what was in it, but it was good and I will definitely be ordering this again when I go back! The salmon was moist and cooked very well. My friends and I all enjoyed it and actually wanted more, though we were pretty stuffed by the end.  The cost overall between three people was $10 each including tip, so it wasn't bad at all. We were all satisfied at the end.",

    "text": "I'm becoming a Panang addict. I have to try it wherever I go. Tonight was no exception. After reading Anthony M's ROTD, I figured this would be a good place to take my Dad for a little birthday dinner with my brother.  Panang Avocado with Salmon. Doesn't that just sound awesome? Well it wasn't mind-blowing, but it was pretty good. Honestly, I still prefer Archi's Panang overall, but I love the fact that it comes with ample large chunks of salmon and avocado. It's kind of a perfect little marriage. You take some salmon and avocado in with your rice on each spoonful. The combination works swimmingly.  As it turns out, my Dad no longer eats spicy food. Fortunately, there are plenty of options for him. He ended up going with the Seafood Wonton soup. It looked delicious and had plenty of seafood. I like the uber-wide bowl they use to serve the soup. My brother went with the Yellow Curry with Tofu. I didn't ask him how it was, but he seemed to enjoy it.  As a side note, it was strange that the place was basically empty when we got there, but within minutes, the place was full. It's like after we sat down, a constant stream of customers just kept walking in until all the tables filled up. Also, I found the TV programming to be interesting. I used to love home improvement shows and seeing an Asian version was definitely entertaining.",

I got the duck noodle soup. I can't really find this anywhere unless I go to LA, so I had to get it here. It was so delicious and full of duck flavor. Duck broth is naturally on the salty side, so don't be surprised if you think it is salty. It taste great! :) we ordered the Thai tea to wash down the spiciness. The Thai tea is just as good as archies, maybe better. For dessert we got fried Ice cream. Its a giant ball of goodness. The guy that works there, Victor, is really sweet and told us to come back for lunch because the deals are better! I am definitely coming back for lunch to see what else they have to offer.",

Don't get me wrong TSNH is good! But it's not Pa Ord.  TSNH's portion is very generous (love it!),  the decor is clean, service is friendly and they also deliver within a 3 mile radius.

I ordered the Pad See Eww- it was delicious, Fried Pork with Chinese broccoli- never disappoints me, squid salad and somtum was not what I expected. I always ask for the squid salad to be less sweet and more on the sour side but they can't seem to make it sour enough.   As for the Somtum I requested it to be made Lao style with 1 Thai pepper which would be enough spice for me and asked for it to be extra sour. Well it wasn't sour, and I think they skipped on the pepper or didn't use real Thai chili pepper/prik ki nou. It really makes a difference on the type of chili you use.   Overall, the food is still great and the prices are the best in town!!",

When I got home, I dug into the potstickers... They were so bomb. I'm definitely getting them every time. Next the Pad See-eu. It was okay, but I tasted absolutely no spice. Really I tasted no seasoning at all, it was bland but not terrible. I probably wouldn't order that again but I am looking forward to trying other items on the menu. Overall it was a good experience, everyone was kind, food was ready quick and the potstickers were a win.",

I got to try the original location first and liked it a lot and since this one is a lot closer to home it's definitely a winner. Although my review is a bit biased since I've only had the beef noodle soup as an entree, it was very tasty and definitely a good lunch size portion for $6.50. My friends enjoyed their curry that they had and pad thai as well. I remember trying the chicken satay and crab rangoons which were decent as well. Prices are reasonable and you can't really go wrong with this place. Their thai iced tea and coffee are a bit on the sweet side, like diabetic sweet so just a fair warning.  $15 dollar minimum to use your credit card.  I will be back!",

It's inexpensive, open late, less than a 5 minute drive away from my house, and they've got some key menu items that keep me coming back. Like several other Asian joints, the service is probably not what you'd expect. Once in a while, they'll forget to give you a napkin or have to go back to grab your utensils and there might even be some miscommunication, but the food is well worth it. Not a huge fan of their pad thai, but I love their duck fried rice and pretty much any of the curries. The portions are generous and the food doesn't take very long either.   Cheap Thai cuisine that tastes good within 5 minutes of my home... Uhm. What else is there to say?",

    "text": "3 stars for decent food at a reasonable price. Quality used to be a lot better when I first started coming here but it's gradually going down. I'm still hopeful that one day there will be some kind of improvement. I stopped coming here because of that but last night I gave it another chance. It's better than the last time I was here so I'm pretty sure I'll be back someday.  My faves are the spicy eggplant, crab fried rice and pad see ew. The eggplant was a bit undercooked. I hope they were not rushing to get the food out just because they have a lot of phone orders.  Service was a bit slow as well although they were nice enough to checked back with us every so often.   The husband was a bit disappointed with the Thai iced tea which was not refillable as most of Thai restaurants in town offers unlimited refills.   Overall, if you are looking for reasonable decent Thai food then this is the place for you.",

I even customized a few dishes that are indicative of Thai Food with their assistance. Tom Yum soup with Clear Noodles and a Shrimp Red Panang Curry. Topping it off with the classic sticky (deliciously f$@kin amazing) rice with Mango.   Service is on point. Food comes out fast and flavors are different (in a great way) than I'm used to with Thai Food. The weather is nice & chilly and I wanted something to warm me up. I asked for it. I got it. Now I'm heading out, barely spent anything, and have sweat dripping down my forehead. I am someone who loves spice but you don't have to get anything here spicy. They make sure to ask you up front.   Thank you Thai House Family. Can't wait to come back!",

This place isn't far from our house, has super reasonable prices, generous portions, and the quality and variety of food is really outstanding.   It's clear that by the number of Doordash, Uber Eats, and other food delivery services that dropped by for pickup orders while we were eating in that their to-go services are their main source of income.   The atmosphere inside is very unassuming, but the expansive menu will change that impression. My husband and I ordered pad-kee-mow, tofu pad thai, and crab fried rice. I tried each dish in our collection of fried carbs, and devoured way more than I usually do; (which is saying a lot since I was in my third trimester of pregnancy.) Needless to say, it was all superb. We'll be ordering from here again - maybe for to-go!",

    "text": "First things first. If you are looking for lunch specials or any type of specials...you're not gonna find any here. Same menu as lunch versus dinner.   Prices weren't too bad. $6.95 for a chicken pad thai plate. Couple bucks more if you want shrimp instead of chicken.  My boyfriend and I both got pad thai. Sorry...I'm original like that. I just can't go to a thai restaurant and NOT get pad thai. I would LOVE to try something different...but I could just never seem to do it.  I like spicy foods. Side note: not sure if everyone is aware of this, but on a scale of 1-10, 1 being the LEAST spicy and 10 being the MOST. Not sure if its different in other thai restaurants but I personally never knew that. Here I've been getting spicy level 4 thinking #1 was considered the MOST spicy. -__- oh geez. Sooooo....I ended up getting a level 8 spiciness.   Getting back to the food, I really loved this place. My pad thai came out pippin' hot and the spiciness was on point. Definitely the kind of spice I was expecting. It has a kick to it without having to sip on water every 30 seconds.   This is definitely a place I'll come back to if I'm ever in this part of town.",

If you're used to the traditional flavors of Thai food, then there's a possibility that you may not like this place. AND the reason why I say that is because of the pad thai & the ladnar (Sp?). These are two dishes that I ordinarily do NOT like at other places, there's usually a funky taste to them and I have no idea how to describe them, they taste almost spoiled to me... I personally am not able to enjoy them because of that. But TSNH's version has me going in for more every time!   We're here a minimum of 2 times a week. Yep-- return visits.",

Everything was delicious and just the right amount of spice. I usually order a 2 spice level and most of the time it will be way too hot but not this place, they got it just right.  I ordered: SIlver Noodle Salad, Thai Fried Rice with Chicken, Thai Spice Noodle with Beef, and Yellow Curry and my total was $29! It's the cheapest Thai restaurant around here and the food is delicious and very generous portions, what more can you ask for?",

Also I asked them why didn't tell me on the phone that the machine is broken and they basically just looked me at and said nothing with and \"oh well \" face. If I just wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have came back, so I brought cash with me and they tried to hand me the old curry I ordered had to ask them to make it fresh for me and looked mad about it.

This place is good and cheap- great for what it is.  Interior is what it is too, nothing super splendid but not shabby either.  They have the Thai channel on as you wait for your food, which can be entertaining at times to see the monkey dancing and other oddities.  Service is fine- quick and attentive.  But their food..  very, very nice.  There was only one other place in Vegas that had bigger portions of pad thai, but that place closed down.  Whomp whomp.  I've tried plenty of their dishes and it's only when I tasted their praram dish that I had to write a review.  It's a stir fry of vegetables and any choice of meat, topped with peanut sauce.  To my, peanut sauce is like an aphrodisiac, and this dish had PLENTY.  So.  Good.  I went here with a friend and I've been returning with more friends ever since.  I'm always hungry late night so an hour or two before they close, if I'm feeling hungry, I'll stop by the place and get something quick.  All other Thai places nearby are way too expensive for what they're putting out- if you're craving it and are in the area, you gotta stop by.",

The service was really quick and friendly. I ordered the beef pad thai from the regular menu since it isn't on the lunch menu. It was less than $7 for the pad thai and the serving size was generous. If you prefer more main dish at the expense of not getting the usual side items that come with a lunch menu order, then come here.  One negative is that they only take debit/credit on orders over $10. As a person that rarely carries cash and likes to track all my spending via my credit card, I definitely dislike that company policy.",

    "text": "Actually Thai Style Noodle House #2, this is a sister/twin of Thai Style Noodle House on Wynn Road. I have written a review for Thai Style #1previously.   The decor for #2 is much nicer than #1. It still has the feel of a local eatery and it's in a newly build strip mall. There is an ornate brass ceiling with chandeliers but the walls are plain orange with a few Pier 1 type art pieces hanging. Nothing too fancy or garish. Nice. The place had a steady stream of customers...not too crowded and not too awkwardly lonely either. A perfect lunch spot.   The service here was also just as good as #1. One of the waitresses at #2 was the same waitress I had at #1.   I was slightly miffed that they did not have vegetarian/vegan lunch specials (as I was told that by the waitress) and had to order off the menu. I ordered the Papaya Salad and the Spicy Flat Noodles (Pad Kee Mao on Thai menus usually). I liked that they had the option to get steamed tofu instead of friend. I opted for the steamed and have to say although let's face it, the fried is much better, this was rather good. I got my food within 10 minutes. The papaya salad was consistent with my experience at #1 and the Flat Noodles were also tasty. I didn't like the addition of white pepper on top of the noodles as a finishing touch. I might tell them to omit that the next time I go there. The flat noodles was sauteed with basil, garlic, steamed tofu, carrots, onions and cabbage. Not out of this world but tasty and satisfied me for lunch.  Papaya Salad + Spicy Flat Noodles + Diet Coke = $15. The meal will last me at least one more day. Not too shabby but would have appreciated a veggie lunch special.   I'm glad these guys opened up something on this side of town. It's close to work and I can frequent when I have a Thai craving.   PS. I tried to take pictures and make this the first review that I started picture adding but I don't know how to turn off the flash on my camera...currently all my pics are bright lights. Once I get more camera savvy I will be going crazy posting pictures.",

Papaya salad compliments any dish, especially meat dishes. Generous portions leave diners satisfied and for an additional charge; brown rice instead of white rice makes a great healthy choice.

Well to my surprise, this place was really good.  I ordered the Shrimp fried rice #10 (as I always do) I told my coworker that it was almost perfect, my only hold back was that the shrimp were a little on the medium/small side and were a little dried out but the flavors were DELICIOUS and they actually made it a #10 as most places don't think that I can handle it and usually make it around a #6 or #7!!! Keep in mind that the shrimp might have been like that because I did get it to go and they most likely just kept cooking in the to go container.  I went home and told my husband about it and we made plans to go that Friday and he would test it out to see if he would like it. Skeptical as I was, he was so surprised at how much he LOVED IT!!!!  He oredered the Duck Fried rice #10, we split the Shrimp Pad Se Eww #10 and I again got Shrimp fried rice number #10. This time the shrimp were perfect, I think it makes a difference when you take it to go. The pad se eww was delicious as was the duck fried rice. The next best thing was the Price All 2 dishes came to just over $27.00. I couldn't even believe it. When we order those same 3 dishes at Pin Kaow it comes over $37.00. The duck fried rice is $5.00 more at Pin Kaow.  That is what I really like about the place, no matter how popular they get they don't raise their prices and that will keep us coming back over and over again.   I would recommend this place over and over again and you better believe that we will be there yet again this Friday night.",

    "text": "My Wife and I found this place after moving to Las Vegas a year ago from Orange County, California. We were soooo excited and happy that we found a Great Thai Food place with Great tasting and with consistency since we are absolute die hard fan of Thai and Chinese food. But on the third visit we placed order by phone for pick up. Upon arriving home and looking at dish we ordered (Mongolian Beef was one), food did not look anything close or taste anything close to Mongolian Beef which we had for soo many times. White color cooked meat in a runny watery beige liquid. Being one of die-hard fan of this dish and having it for past 25+ years I never seen a Mongolian Beef looking like this. Total disappointment.  Today 8/28 my wife and I figured to give them one more chance. What a Mistake that was. the best part of the lunch was cold can of coke. Pineapple Curry which I ordered was sooo watery. My wife's food had totally different color (Same Dishes we both orders the first 2 visit) and tasted completely different. When asked why the food look  and taste so much different they could not give us an straight answer. Appears they use the earlier customers left over and mix few stuff to serve the new customers order. That seems the only explanation that we can come up with if the owner claims everything in the restaurant is the same as before.  Bottom line going to this place is like rolling the dice. if you are lucky you end up with good food otherwise you are in for an experience which turns you off from any Thai food.",

A friend wanted Thai food, so I suggested this spot since it was closer to both of us as oppose to the other location.  Judging by this dish alone i would have never guess that the two Thai Style Noodle House are sister properties.  It was just so terrible and tasteless compare to the other one.  Not enjoyable at all.  So much that I would not think about coming back and play it safe by sticking to the original one on Wynn.  Oh, but hey, nice ceiling!",

The woman on the phone was very nice, and informed us the delivery would take about 45 minutes, since they were busy.  We were fine with this, unfortunately I can't say the same about the food.  The Pad thai showed up in a large clump of mushy noodles.  The flavors were all there, but the texture ruined the dish.    The Fried Chicken wings had feathers on them.  Yes, feathers.  This should never happen, but clearly someone in the kitchen was rushing.  Either way, disgusting.  The Pineapple fried rice lacked the flavor many others have had, but it wasn't gross, just not very good.  It was on the light side which was nice, but still is not worth ordering.   I'm not remotely interested in trying this place again, there are way too many Thai restaurants to settle for poor quality food.",

We gave it a try and it was excellent, the best thing we had.  We also had the spicy eggplant with ground beef, the rad-na noodles with chinese broccoli, the cucmber salad, and the mango with sticky rice.    The rad-na was extremely soupy with a gravy like sauce.  Way too saucy! It was ok.  We wouldn't order it again.  The eggplant had a really thick, almost unchewable skin.  Otherwise, tasty.  The mango with sticky rice was done perfecty; furthermore, it was only $3.95!?!?!? Holy moly! it's usually a $9.00 item.    Our entire bill for appetizer, 3 dishes and dessert was $30.  It won't be THE best Thai food ever but it is tasty, friendly, clean, and cheap.  I'll go back!",

Our favorites here are: beef larb, rad na, pad see ew, spicy egg plant (we can't eat too spicy so we opt for #3 spice) and most def the Thai ice tea.

We frequent this place and I've tried most of the more appealing items on the menu.  Must haves:  Coconut Water!  Try it!  It's sweet with chunks of coconut right in the glass.  Surprisingly good!  Thai style pot stickers...quality deep fried dumplings, but with a kicker.  Three different sauces on top.  Believe it or not, makes all the difference.  Amazing!  Grilled beef or pork salad.  Thai style salads are great!  Crunchy and tasty, TSNH makes one of the best.  It's a great combination of meat and veggies and priced well for the size too.  Roasted Duck Noodle Soup.  Sweet and plentiful.  You can choose your noodles, so I usually pick the thicker rice noodles and add wontons for extra heartiness.  Sweet broth goes perfectly with the duck and it's filling and good!  Tom Yum  Noodle Soup.  My friend's favorite!  Coconut base with a spicy bite.  That sweet and sour flavor is unmistakable and again, big portions, hearty and filling!  Khua Kai.  I compare this to it's chinese counterpart of fried rice noodles, but they serve it with a side of duck sauce that makes the thai version just a hair better.  Pretty simple dish, fried with scallions and egg with soy sauce, but when you mix it with the duck sauce...it's a perfect match!  Duck fried rice.  The duck adds a moist, more tender meat than your typical chicken, beef and pork.  Add that to a definite thai style of fried rice here, and it's just great fried rice!  Mangos with sweet sticky rice.  I grew up on sticky rice and this dessert runs $6 at the thai place down the street!  It's the same thing and always tastes better when it's less expensive!",

Ever had old fish and just know its old because of the strong fishy taste?  well that's exactly how my salmon tasted.  i know what salmon tastes like and fresh salmon does not have a strong fishy odor or fishy taste.  I just did not get the same experience as everyone else who's had this.    As for my boyfriend's experience, well lets just saw that he wasn't as impressed as he was the past two times.  The fried rice was not as tasty and clearly looked like it was cooked in no more than a minute.  Of course i'm over exaggerating but its just not as great as china town location and the first time we ordered from here.",

The first star was lost because our first dish with sticky rice was way too small for the price.. you would probably have to order 10 of those to get full. It's the dish photographed. It tasted great, just very small for the price. The other minus was for the service, I don't think the server we had spoke a word of English. She just came and dropped off stuff. For example when she came with extra plates for me and my friend she just dumped them on the table paired instead of placing them on mine and his side. Will go back to try their Tom Ka soup but not because of the service.",

Well, take one hand open it up and place something of outstanding quality there, then take the other side of your hand and also place something of really good quality there but A LOT of it, then CLAP your hands together! Aside from Hercules Hercules! What do you have? The meeting of QUALITY and QUANITY! Innovative I know, but that is exactly how I would describe this place they serve up plates and plates of delicious food and you get A LOT of it!   I have yet to be disappointed each time of come here and have explored a vast majority of the menu! Must tries are their pad Thai, duck fried rice, chicken panang, basil beef, basil fried rice and if your LAO or prefer the Lao style papaya salad rather than Thai, they have the best LAO Style papaya salad! Super great location and awesome prices. Service is also stellar. Recommended for all your savory Thai cravings!",

So when I found out that there was a Thai Style Noodle House closer to my house, I had to go!  I came in with my mom and dad for dinner. I ordered (of course) the bbq pork fried rice with an egg on top, my mom ordered the pad thai, and my dad ordered the mongolian beef.  I've never actually dined in at Thai Noodle House since I usually take out and bring it to work, so this was my first time and let me just say the portion for the fried rice is huge! You can definitely share it among a couple people.  I was super satisfied with the bbq pork portion as well! Their fried rice wasn't super greasy like other thai places' tend to be.  For dessert we ordered the sticky rice with mango and this was a real winner for me. I highly recommend it! It's warm sweet sticky rice with a heavy cream on top and mango on the side. I won't be able to come here without getting it, I can tell you that.",

We initially decided to head to Archi's, but ended up at Thai Style last minute.   Prices are always great here and service is good too. Since the weather is cold and I've been battling a cold, spicy was what I was craving. I went with the spicy Thai noodles and asked for a level 6 spice level. Everything was just as good as I remember and the spice level was right on mark. I didn't go too spicy since noodles tend to absorb the heat a little more than other Thai dishes. Everything was great and it made me wonder why I don't come here more often. Definitely great prices and great food in the Southwest area.",

Very little chicken (which is usually tough) in the chicken curry, which includes more carrots than any other vegetable, but also includes green bell peppers, usually wilted/bitter/aging basil, and then the usual ingredients in that dish that you would expect.  Pad Thai flavor is good, but often the sprouts are old and getting slightly slimy/funky.  Chicken is a little dry and tough in this as well.",

I ordered what I usually get (beef and broccoli) at the original house to compare it to this one. My BF ordered a combination bowl with small rice noodle. Both of the dishes weren't as good as the original house, but they weren't bad either. It was almost as if they both tasted more bland.   The servers were very nice. One of them was so engaged with his customer they were talking about boxing almost the whole time we were eating... Lol. (Go Manny!!!)

The chicken satay portions were small and it wasn't that flavorful. The pineapple fried rice was very oily and greasy and didn't really have a pineapple flavor to it, but the chicken and cashews they added to it helped. The chicken curry was my favorite, it had a lot of flavor and the portions for the curry were quite big. A bowl of rice came with the chicken curry. We ordered mild spice for the curries, but it was a little spicy. Place was small but, a lot of families were coming in and out to eat dinner, so it's a good place to eat with family or a large group.",

My bf & I were a bit skeptical after having seen this place before, but I'm glad that even if we had been here before, we decided to try it one more time.   We ended up coming in right around 12:30pm, a time where usually Thai restaurants are fairly busy -- but this one wasn't!   We sat down, and without having to ask, water was served (always a PLUS). The prices on the menu are more than reasonable...I believe almost all of the items were under $10 -- and the menu is EXTENSIVE.  I ordered my favorite item, Papaya Salad (medium spice) & my bf ended up getting Kung Pao Shrimp. The papaya salad was AWESOME SAUCE. It was a rather spicy, probably more than medium spice, but it was delicious. The kung pao shrimp was very good too. I loved the black bean sauce. It was sauteed until the onions and peppers were tender. ALL THE BETTER.   I'll be back!",

Seafood included slices of fish cakes, shrimp, mussel, and fish balls. It would have been perfect if they threw some mushrooms in there.   Service was alright. Took a long while before they even brought out my husband's lunch. And when they did, they didn't bring him anything to eat it with. Had to ask for the condiments as well since there was none on our table.    This seem to be the only Thai restaurant in the surrounding area.

The lady who took my order was neutral but courteous, and she repeated my order correctly without me asking. I ordered the Khua-Kai rice noodles, Beef Basil fried rice, the Choo-chee Chicken Curry, an order of potstickers, and two Thai teas. Everything turned out to be good and tasty, especially the Curry! I didn't even notice that the Basil Beef I ordered came with the rice on the side instead of everything fried together...actually I just thought of it now, so it was obviously that good! The potstickers came with a few sauces drizzled on top, which was nice because it was already prepared. Also, I usually order the Thai tea without ice, so it doesn't get diluted and when I get home I dilute the tea with some of my own tea because it is really, very sweet and I get a few more glasses out of it.   I would prefer to dine-in because I think they are more generous with the portions as opposed to how much they serve with take out. However, it was still filling, delicious, and not so heavy! Everything was also affordable at just under $37. And at the end of this dinner, you don't feel like you undid your entire week of working out on just one meal :)",

The owners need to CLEAN the place and replace the chairs and menus. The servers need uniforms and worst of all, the food quality has suffered and rarely does a full table of food come out at the same time.

There were many other great choices I had near the area but so glad I chose this one.  Small, cozy little restaurant with a pretty big menu and really great prices. I had the hardest time deciding but I went with the panang chicken and some fried flat noodles.  The noodles came out first and I had planned to eat only half of it while the panang was coming out. Well, I've never been good on that portion control thingy and I ended up scarfing the whole plate of noodles down. It came with Thai sweet chili sauce and I added sriracha on top of all that. Very delicious, better than my usual pad see ew.   The panang was simple, not filled with bamboo shoots and other veggies. Just a nice thick curry sauce and some red pepper flakes and of course the chicken. Although I don't mind bamboo and veggies I prefer my panang simply made like this. It was a little bit salty which may be bad for most but I loved it cuz I am a sodium freak.  I would love to come back and try all the other dishes. The Thai beef noodle soup and grilled meat dishes looked really good. The service was very friendly and attentive.  The great thing is that this isn't their only location. Phewww, cuz out of all 3 this was the furthest from my house. But if  this were the only location, I would definetly come back here. Next time, I'll be going to either the Chinatown location or the one in Summerlin.",

It may be that I'm not observant but I don't remember the other location having duck as an option for the noodle dishes.  Pad see ew with duck is definitely better than the beef, chicken, etc options.  The tender slices of roast duck are nicely seasoned.  We also tried some appetizers, the crispy calamari is fried to perfection.  The fried chicken wings were disappointing, fried until they were slightly jerky in texture and no crispy crunch to the outside =(.  But overall, great place with great food....and helps that it's a few doors down from Sweet Addictions! Definitely head over there for an ice cream sandwich dessert!",

    "text": "First things first: this would be a five star review, however they were out of panang curry when I visited last...this will easily be bumped that extra star if this was an isolated incident.  I loved that panang!  Thai Style Noodle House was a real treat.  This location is a few suites down from Waffles Cafe on Fort Apache.  During one of my visits to Waffles Cafe, I saw that the staff was ordering Thai food; within 20 mins the food was delivered.  After some investigation I saw that Thai Style Noodle House had recently opened this location.  Later that week I stopped by for dinner and ordered a chef special, panang curry with avocado and salmon.  This was simply...awesome.  For my curry fix I've been going to Archi's...if only I found Thai Style sooner!  The avocado was a bit hard, but the flavor of the panang brought a smile to my face with each bite.  I ordered it at a 5 out of 10 on the hot scale, and it was what I expected.  After a second visit, they've been consistent with their scale through the four dishes that I've thus tried.  Since then I've had the papaya salad, red curry, and the pad see ew.  After adding some chili powder to the papaya for a little more kick, it became a great side dish to the entrees.  The red curry was good, but I enjoyed the panang a lot more (they were out of panang this night).  And the pad see ew was a very pleasant surprise!  I've had this dish before at other restaurants, and it came out oily and bland.  But here the noodles were cooked perfectly and mixed in with egg and beef, creating a lovely texture with the soft egg and noodles giving way to the thinly sliced beef.    I've been expanding my tastes recently when it comes to Thai cuisine, and I can't wait for my next visit to Thai Style!",

The Tom Kha was probably the best I've had in Vegas.  The flavor was spot on.  The Pad See Eu really stood out as well.  It ties for my favorite with The King and I (at The Lakes).   I'm removing one star because the dish my boyfriend ordered (a flat noodle dish, with chicken, and Thai style gravy) was really gross.  I don't know if it just wasn't our thing...but this was something else.  The gravy was...abundant, and slimy.  I tried to give this a shot after refrigeration, when the gravy \"settled\", but it still looked very visually off-putting, and really didn't taste that great.   Other than the one disappointing dish, our visit went great.  I'm sure we'll be back.",

    "text": "Thai Style Noodle House of Chinatown has expanded to the southwest side, in the same plaza as Waffles Cafe. The restaurant has been called the best Thai Restaurant in Vegas (not Lotus of Siam),  so there is pressure for this restaurant to deliver if its to carry the Thai Style Noodle House name and it does!  @ NH Style Potstickers - This was a delicious appetizer taking a book from the Japanese drizzling spicy mayo, eel sauce, and some hot sauce. Sprinkled on top is some sesame seeds, white onions, and green onions. The only issue with this item was the wonton wrap was fried a little bit too much so it was hard, not crispy. I told the waiter and the manager thanked me for it and gave me the item half off. Yay! Hopefully in the future they'll fix this issue.   @ Seafood Wonton Soup w/ Rice Noodles - This place sure gets you your money worth. Filling the noodles with wontons, shrimp, fish balls, sea cucumber,  clams, and fish. The chicken broth is a clean tasting and delicious. A good fulfilling and delicious dish for $7.60.  This place opened this past week and looks like they're getting some foot traffic already.  The decor is nice, doesn't look like the hole in the wall Chinatown version. The fake granite tables, copper ceiling, and simple layout makes this an inviting place to come eat.   Service is very friendly and attentive. When I explained to them my concerns for one of their appetizer, they were genuinely appreciative. This is a rare thing to find.  A new restaurant (kind of) that delivers the first time, with some minor issues. Great food and service makes you consider going to this place over the other surrounding Thai restaurants.",

The menu prices are definitely a steal compared to other Thai places I've been to, and the menu choices are diverse ranging from classic curries to a variety of noodles (each with a description).   Wanting something healthy, I ordered the Papaya Salad- crunchy julienned green papaya, peanuts and tomatoes tossed together in a sour, sweet, and slightly spicy (level 3) vinaigrette. The vinaigrette also had fish sauce in it, so if you're not a fan of fish sauce, I'd recommend something else. On the side of the heap of papaya salad were a few pieces of cabbage. The salad was refreshing and light. My only complaints are: 1) The tomato pieces on top were mushy; and 2) I wish they added more peanuts. The peanuts added depth to the salad, and cut the vinegary-ness of the dressing. Overall, however, I enjoyed the salad very much. I also tried a bit of the Green Curry w/ brown rice which was really yummy. Spicy, but not too spicy. Sweet, but not too sweet. Just really tasty.  I also am a fan of the water! They put slices of fruit (lemons, strawberries & green apples) in the water pitcher, which I thought was pretty and gave the water a nice taste. The server made sure my water glass was never empty.   I definitely want to come back to try their noodle dishes (Apparently, the duck noodle soup is amazing). Good eats.",

    "text": "I decided to check it out because of the reviews and honestly probably one of the worst thai food I. 've ever had. I ordered the pumpkin yellow curry and it tasted like salt and no spices. Also, I could tell it's been sitting in the back for a while and was just continuously reheated due to that the potato's were mashed into the sauce. The reason I am giving two starts is because the service was really good and big portions.  Pros: Big portion, great service Cons: Yellow curry",

    "text": "It seems that the owners of Thai Style noodle house like to compete with other Thai restaurants. Their location in Chinatown is surrounded by Thai places and on Fort Apache theres an abundant amount of Thai places. I don't think TSNH is a knock out for the other restaurants its competing against, but its cheap.  The value of the items you order is a great bang for the buck and they have a large variety of noodles. Although it always weirds me out when I see a Thai restaurant sell won ton noodles.   Sometimes the wait time is a bit long (I see an elderly thai lady working in the kitchen which is a good and bad thing). If you come here in a party, I would probably skip the chef specials, not because they're not good, but because you'll probably be waiting another 10 minutes or so while your friends are grubbing.   Oh yeah, I find it a little weird that not all their drinking glasses are the same color. I think its a little weird when we get 7 waters and 3 are in clear glasses while the other 4 are in red.  The service is nice though, never really had a problem with any orders.  THE SUMMARY: cheap, variety, long wait, weird cups, decent service.",

Service was good too. The young girl who helped us was very nice, same with the young guy. The older lady, maybe the manager or owner, not as friendly but I think maybe she is just too focused in the business. Prices are ridiculously low, less than $7 for most dishes. Highly recommend it !",

    "text": "As an obsessed, official Duchess of the original location, I felt obligated to try #2! We sampled lunch, and for some reason, I wanted to sample something different, so I didn't go for my usual curry. I ordered up some stir fried broccoli. Yes, American broccoli. I love it, and I wanted it. The dish was very simple and fresh. The green goods in a light sauce, which was similar to a brown sauce you might get at a Chinese restaurant. Of course, they have brown rice, but they do charge a bit extra now (.75).   One thing that I did discover on this trip was the assortment of Thai condiments in little glass jars on the table. I had never used them before, but I decided, \"Why the heck not?\" Good decision on my part, as I am a big fan of the jalapenos and will probably add them on to all of my future dishes at Thai Style. A couple of those on some brown rice and I could be pretty happy. Yes, I am officially a cheap date.  Of course, the thing to note is the beautiful, new interior, which is very different from the hole-in-the-wall style of the original. Each has its own charm.   Service was great. We even saw some familiar faces from #1. From what I can tell, they are going to be able to maintain quality at both locations. There were a couple of bumps while they were getting in new chefs for both locations, but based on my recent visits, both spots seem to be on the right track for tastiness!",

The orange chicken is in a batter so light and fluffy we renamed it doughnut chicken. All but one of the wait staff are friendly and efficient. If you get the girl who invests in her appearance and not her personality or profession, your order will be wrong and you will be asking for essentials like forks and your drinks, getting nothing but attitude.",

Not sure why they didn't just give the lunch special menu like they do at their 3rd location in Summerlin. When you go for lunch be sure to ask for the lunch special menu. So much food! They currently have a 5.99 1 item combo with soup, rice and fried item. Add an additional item if you're hungry for 7.99. Their lunch menu encompasses a lot of choices from spicy eggplant to various curries. Mind you they don't do pad thai for the lunch special. But you won't miss it with all the other items they offer. And the prices can't be beat.",

I decided to see if it had gotten any better, I am referring to the service. it doesn't matter who you get they are all equally terrible and rude. This will be my very last visit here since nothing will ever change.   I ordered a Thai Chai tea with milk (cold version). The lady delivers my drink and I tasted it and it was pure sugar you couldn't taste anything else but sugar! On prior occasions this was not the case! I asked her to take it back and add more milk less Thai tea. So she brings it back but no change at all even after adding more milk. So after taking one sip I told her I could not drink it and she actually had the $&@;! to tell me not to order it again that it would always be like that. She was lecturing me like a child and for the sake of not making a usual scene like I would if I was alone. This time I was quiet and didn't talk back.   So it's safe to say if you like crappy service and being lectured just go here!",
