For myself (one entree) and two kids the price was nearly $70.  That's ridiculous.  Granted I had two margaritas, but the kids meals are ridiculously expensive for what you get and don't even include a drink.  We didnt even think to ask if the kids drinks were included, because what restaurant doesn't include them?  What casual restaurant charges an arm and a leg for a generic kids meal and doesn't even include a beverage.  We won't go back for a family meal.  Food is fine, but not worth the price.  You think when you spend that kind of money for an adult and two kids you're getting appetizers and desserts, but no....  never again.",

I've popped in here a few times for happy hour (3-6pm) and have left happy each time because their Micheladas are some of the best I've had in the area. This is my go-to beer drink and I make them myself at home so I'd like to think I know my Micheladas. They have Bohemia beer which right away is a plus because a lot of Mexican/Spanish food restaurants don't have it for some strange reason. The mix they use is devine, it has the perfect taste and is only slightly spicy. They dress it with a Tajin rim and a skewer of lime, jalapeno, and a cocktail shrimp. I had chips and salsa along with a small bowl of dipping beans along with my drinks each time. The salsa is great too, not too much tomato sauce. But the beans were my favorite, I about licked that bowl clean.",

When ordering our food he was questioning us with attitude like we weren't reading the same menu. And talking to us like we were stupid. Then when we politely asked the bus boy who brought us our chips and salsa (which we liked him) for a new waiter we were asked if we were serious. Excuse me? If we weren't serious we wouldn't have asked. We honestly were shocked in how we were being treated! We were kind of laughing at how the experience was going, but being optimistic that hopefully the food would make up for it. That was laughable! The enchilada sauce tasted like spaghettios! The ceviche had no taste to it!! Drowning it in lime didn't help. We're not from here, just here visiting. But this place would never be considered again when we return. So much for trying to make your customers happy!! Lol. So disappointing!",

The owner and service staff were very visible and were very attentive to us.  The facility is great.  I'm from Texas and we know our mexican food...this one ranks up there with the best. Total for the meal (guacamole, two entrees, add tamales, and add flan) was  just over $50 which is reasonably proced, especially given the quality and amount of food we had.

We stopped going because they charged another parties dinner on our card and we noticed when we got home we had just paid $120 for two meals. We were given the run around all day trying to get the money reimbursed. They had a problem with it and it took up our whole day trying to get it resolved. Now, tonight I was craving a bean and cheese burrito with wet sauce and rice and beans on the side so I went and ordered that to go. When I got home, all I had was a wet bean and cheese burrito, no rice and beans. I was pretty upset since I just spent $14.05 for just a burrito and didn't get the full entree. My husband went back to the restaurant and they said that was correct, I had only ordered the \"wet bean and cheese burrito\". My husband said no, she spent $14.05 because it was suppose to be the entree. They proceeded to not agree and not fix the problem. My husband just said forget it and drove back home. That price is pretty outrageous for just a bean and cheese burrito with no meat but the main point is if the girl taking my order was actually paying attention, she would have heard that I wanted a wet burrito with rice and beans on the side. They don't care to make anything right with the customer when there's conflict. I work in customer service and if something is wrong, we do our best to fix it. This has happened to us twice and we will not be returning.",

She brought out our beers with salt and lime and no tomato juice/ Clamato... when i brought this to her attention, she had an attitude and brought us a small cup of Clamato for two \"micheladas\". At this point we were over the attitude and the disgusting drinks and left.

Anyhow, the wait staff were very clean cut and friendly.  Standard chips and salsa (pretty good).  My server was quick to check on me and get my drink order, plus gave me a couple of minutes to check out the menu.  I ordered the chile relleno and beef taco combo (to include ride and beans).  The food didn't take too long, plus, it was hot (heat).  The shredded beef was tender and didn't have any stray large chunks to deal with.  The relleno was tasty, filled with cheese.

It was about 7 pm, I was tired and starving and now I was upset.  When I was going to call the restaurant, there was no phone number listed on the receipt.  Had to find the phone number on line and it was always busy.  I went back to the restaurant only to find that the person that took the order was very defensive and non-apologetic.  I requested my money back and the process was chaotic as well.  Ultimately, the manager tried to fix things, but by then it was too late.  Never again.  Very incompetent staff.",

Thank you Gabby Luna for your great customer service and for making our time more enjoyable! You and our server Juan were key to our experience, I will definitely be back with my family and recommended to anyone! Ayer fui a casa don Juan por primera vez a celebrar mi cumpleanos con unas amigas. Desde el momento que entre todos fueron muy amables la comida deliciosa. Pero dos personas hicieron aun mas agradable nuestra visita al restaurante nuestro mesero Juan y la manejadora Gaby Luna. Sin duda alguna regresare con mi familia y recomendare este lugar!!",

What a great lineup of margaritas from mango to pomegranate. The staff is always great to me as well as the owners.  When I'm really feeling down and I need to pick me up I'll go there, just to see Juan.  He so attentive, he cares about you not only as a customer, but as an individual, he knows my order even before I  Think about it.  He definitely is an asset to your company with his smile and his hugs and his hospitality. Keep him around he makes my day because its \" Juan day one day at a time\" ...boom Shaka lacka ... don't ignore this post at least give it a try you will not be disappointed, open late.

Another plus is the chips. They weren't greasy at all but I had to add salt for my taste.  Good bean dip and salsa both complimentary.  My husband ordered a watermelon jalapeno margarita and I did the pomegranate margarita both very tasty.  My second round didn't taste nearly the same and when I sent it back the waiter came back and it looked and tasted like they just dropped pomegranate in the margarita I just sent back.  Hummmm.  I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it so like a sport I drank it.  After stuffing my face with chips I wasn't hungry so decided on a al la cart tamale cheese and jalapeno. Decent... I had hoped for more cheese and more than one jalapeno but whatever.  My husband ordered the fajitas... Big disappointment here. Fajitas are meant to be sizzling!!!!!! Nothing when they arrived to the table. The bummer part was the table next to us got theirs sizzling hot.  It presented like the food was sitting around for awhile.   The chicken was dry and shrimp was small.  Overall wasn't terrible will try it again but mainly for drinks and chips!  We may even take advantage of the free shuttle service that will take you home!  Everyone should try this place just for that!",

I order the same thing every time, the number 31. The only complaint I have is that it can get kinda loud with the patrons in the restaurant celebrating birthdays and different events.",

The service and inability to actually take care of your patrons is a complete disappointment considering the history of this restaurant in this town.   Decent food, cannot make up for repeated poor service. Either they are not staffing for their volumes or they expect people to overlook the lackluster experience they are providing. I had referred many people to this restaurant over the years and held corporate functions here. I will find a new place to spend money and I hope others expect more for their money.   It feels like Casa Don Juan management has forgotten there's a ton of excellent restaurants in this town and in order to keep patrons you have to actually maintain a level of customer service.   I will certainly be moving on and not returning.",

I don't think that you can even call it salsa but whatever it was seemed like it had been mixed with water. I got a chicken enchilada, chicken tamale rice and beans. The enchilada was dry and the tamale was thick like a rock with too much masa. My son got a veggie burrito and a tamale which he liked the burrito but not the tamale. My other son is anti Mexican food. His burger was cooked the night before it seems and his fries were cold. My daughter got the chicken enchilada and refused to eat it. Mind you I'm not talking about 7 and 8 year olds. My mom got an chili verde dish which was good and I ate some when she went to the rest room. My husband got a quesadilla, rice and beans which was described as fair. Our bill was over $100 and I would have preferred to eat off of a catering truck. Maybe because I'm from LA and we have great Mexican food but I wouldn't recommend it nor would I go back.",

    "text": "Thank goodness I purchased a Groupon, because this place is not worth the prices listed. I get it, you're in Summerlin and I've heard the prices are just as high at their Downtown location... but for the quality of the food, they should be lower.  Restaurants sometimes have the enormous 10 page menus, and Casa in fact does. It's a little too much with the stories and photos. If I wanted to read a book, I would go to the library. Unfortunately I was hungry. We walked in and were seated in a 2 seater mini table close to the Frida wall. My son knows about art, and knows Frida, as well as Diego Rivera, so this was pretty cool. We got to look at the prints whilst waiting for the server. I took a look at the 30 page menus and tried to decide what to order. The menu is Bilingual, and I speak and read Spanish, but for some it may be tedious. Some descriptions about the food is not on there so you either have to Google it or ask.   It seems like the server for our section was the server for 2 others as well. The others seated after were asked for their drink order before we were, and it's probably because of the order of the tables... but still... we were waiting at least 5 minutes more than they were. Either way, we got our order in.   I decided on the fajitas that included shrimp, chicken, and steak. My son went with a burger (basically because I make him the other items on a daily basis) we were given chips, bean dip, and salsa. My son was starving so he attacked the salsa and said it was good. The chips were pretty tasty as well. Our food eventually came out and my one request was that I did not want peppers in the fajita mixture, also, the same couple who was served their drinks first, also got their food before we did.  ANYWAY! Our food came out and the server left. I looked at my sons and it looked like your typical burger, the taste was good, and it wasn't cold so that's a plus. The fries included were thinner fries and were delicious as well... Now.. my food. Being that I ordered fajitas sans peppers I was ok with onions. I looked and there was about 4 pounds of onions. Now I like onions, just not the amount that was included... it was more like meat with my onions. Not only that, but they were caramelized to death, which was pretty disgusting after the 4th bite. The lettuce included was also brown and wilted. The steak, was cooked to death, it was also caramelized, the shrimp, the few that was included was were also on the tough side, and the few pieces of chicken I got were ok.   The total was around $30ish, and we only ordered waters. I was going to go for desert, but, the plethora of onions killed my stomach and appetite.  I would've said something, but, our server was always running around and not in our area. I ended up with HELLA left overs, unfortunately when you try to cook food that is overcooked, the outcome is bad.  Meh.",

We ordered an Asada wet burrito plate (green AND red sauce please) green sauce is like a picante lime (huge fan) and the red sauce was more tomatoe based (still bomb)   And all the tequila brands you could possibly want !   Order the flan!!! So spongey   Our bartender Xavier is the perfect balance between attentive and leaves you alone. Love this place",

    "text": "I'll keep it simple. These guys offer cheese dip and guacamole right off the bat, but in a tone that it's complimentary. They're so \"friendly\" you almost don't think twice to ask if it's complimentary or if you're ordering an appetizer.  Next up, they offer meat or seafood substitutions that aren't listed on the menu. For example, my dinner plate came with a taco, the waiter offered fish or shrimp as a substitution but FAILED to mention there was an additional charge to choose fish or shrimp.   This is not the only scam type move they do, they offer to get you more salsa and refried beans, again in that \"friendly\" tone, BUT if you pay attention to the menu, in SMALL print, it says refills for salsa and beans costs $4. They FAIL to inform their customers of such a charge.  It's not so much that we paid (were scammed) a few extra dollars, but it's more of the principle and genuine service factors.   Be up front, be straight, be honest.   Food is mediocre, nothing great and it's overpriced.  Very very bland experience.",

Happy hour margarita available at 2 for $8.99 so ordered that plus a glass of water so we could peruse the extensive menu. Fresh chips with salsa and bean dip delivered to the table. Chips were not greasy at all as per other reviews.   My friend went with the Super Burrito, with carne and pork. He managed to get through about 3/4 before declaring himself stuffed. I had the carne asada plate at $15.99, and it was so much food that I had to pack half to take home. I felt the prices were fair for what you got, which was good quality food.   No complaints at all other than you can't get the bacon wrapped shrimp other than with the mega meal package. My friend used to go to a place near Encinitas just for these bacon wrapped shrimp and was excited to see them, but alas, we coudn't get them as an appetizer. Sad face.  Overall, quality food, plenty of it. Prices a bit high but not outrageous. Drink prices did look a bit spendy though, so go during happy hour. Nice, clean place, and very good service.",

One of the reasons I am giving 4 stars is because the food took a while compared to the other location and I like the decor of the other location better. I got the chips and guacamole to start, it was good but I prefer guacamole to have more of a spicy flavor in it. This one was very bland. My entree was 1 cheese enchilada and 1 cheese tamale. The cheese enchilada with green sauce was so good!! This is definitely my favorite place to get enchiladas. However, I ordered a cheese tamale and they brought me one with meat which as a vegetarian I can not eat. The waiter gave me a cheese one once I showed him mine had meat but it took a while so that is another reason I gave 4 stars. Overall, the service is friendly and the food is definitely good. Hopefully this location gets a little faster with their service in the future!",

    "text": "It is with heavy heart that I write my first not so good review:(   I pondered writing this review for a while for several reasons. First of all, I swore to myself that I would only write 5 star reviews because I don't really like saying negative things about a place. I'm motivated by positive experiences not negative ones. Secondly, I didn't want the review to be clouded by my negative feelings that were initially present, as I was still shocked by the service and the bill days later! Finally, I debated on the number of stars to give since I've never written a review with less than 5. I'm an all or nothing type person so my initial thought was to give it 1 star but decided that it would be wrong to do that since I was able to eat the food and finish my drink.   Just before posting this, I asked my daughter her opinion and she said 2 stars. She wanted to walk out after 10 minutes but she is kinda agro. She thought I was being generous by giving it 3 stars so let's just say it was 2-1/2 stars!   I also hate writing really long reviews because I start to bore myself! However, this review probably needs to be long because there is so much to talk about. Ok here I go!   So my daughter had just moved to Vegas,  and had been asking the locals if they knew of a good Mexican restaurant. Everyone told her Lindo Michoacan or Casa Don Juan. So when I came to visit, we decided to come here as it was close to where she lives.   Ok I'm already bored so I'll just get to the point! Bad service, mediocre food, weak drinks, and high prices!",

The chips and salsa came out, but the guacamole didn't come out until we were almost done with our dinner!   Food was good for the people I was with, but came out wrong for me. Asked for a vegetarian burrito enchilada style as a meal, and the tortilla was cold, only enchilada sauce came on the burrito, no cheese. When I told the bus boy that brought my burrito out that I ordered it as a meal he said the sides cost extra, so I said never mind (even though I ordered it as a meal).  Before dinner came out I told the nearby server in the same section as our server (since I couldn't find my server) that it was my Dad's birthday and if they could please bring out a dessert but not sing. They never brought him a dessert.   We saw our server twice total, it seemed like he was too much in a rush when we did see him. Lots of different people serving the table, and the communication isn't there.   I won't be going back, the service was probably the worst I've ever had.",

They did not put sour cream on the tacos like I asked, the taco meat and tortilla were so burnt they fell apart as soon as I put the tiny dab of salsa they gave me on. They put three orders of fried ice cream in one bag, on top of the hot food, so it was melted by the time it got to my house. Besides that, the \"fried ice cream\" was just one scoop of flavorless ice cream with fruity pebbles sprinkled on top for $7. Roberto's Tacos is cheaper, closer, and better",

Okay so simple review cuz I know I'll want their chile relleno again. Yes their CHILE RELLENO is super flavorful. Their combos are so fulfilling. There's practically 3 meals in a combo cuz you get two of something (same or different choices), plus the beans and rice with a tortilla. The extras you can basically make a burrito with. Then there's chips. Awesome stuff!   Oh and their chicken soup so hearty with the potatoes and veggies. Great for comfy food!  I've passed by the restaurant numerous times. I believe there's a bar and margarita specials. Inquire within.  4.5**** includes the benefit of them having Yelp's Eat24 delivery or pickup.   Gotta love their chile rellenos though!

I'm thinking in my head: \"This lady is NOT listening to me.\" I repeat again all meat burrito. She says 15 min. I get a call one minute later from her saying the burrito comes with rice & beans. I tell her the menu I saw online(yelp picture says 6 months ago) says they have something called Burrito Pura Carne which is all meat. I asked her if the menu changed. I think she goes to look at the menu. I know some people would get irritated but I'm just glad she called to make sure the order is correct. She must be new or doesn't know the menu or people barely order it. I know some people would have docked a star for that. So I review restaurants mostly on taste. The carne asada all meat burrito I got was very flavorful. $10 for great tasting all meat carne asada is reasonable. So much better tasting than the one at Roberto's which was dry & not great flavor. It even came with free chips & salsa which was just ok.",

Got his usual Vegetarian Burrito (no cheese, no sour cream...they always exclaim \"no dairy\") and I also wrote that he wanted it wet. With red sauce. Didn't come with sauce ok whatever. The burrito was cold and he said it didn't have the same flavor as usual. He heated it up and ate it.   Side of beans and side of rice were warm and their usual taste.  I ordered lemonade and took my chances on it not being sweet (I don't eat sugar) and it wasn't. It was strong lemon water and I loved it.   Hubs wanted mango juice. I tried it and while yummy...wowza it was sweet af.  I ordered guacamole and it wasn't in the bag, oh well. No chips and sauce option...and the order came with none.  For fun I ordered a pineapple raisin Tamale. Wow it was weird and pink. I guess it's a flavoring in the masa. It was sweet and had a chai like cinnamon spice. Tossed into trash. It honestly tasted just like a fruit cake!!!!!  It was fun to order but now we know that the location Downtown is better and it's better to go in and enjoy our burritos.",

    "text": "Last night my husband and came here for dinner and were greeted by a very friendly staff, our server, Jose S, was promptly at our table serving us our happy hour drinks and chips, salsa, and beans :)  I asked if they had a vegetarian/vegan menu, or what they could offer for vegans.  We were told they could do a veggie burrito no cheese no sour cream, or a bean tostada no cheese no sour cream.  Sounded great, so I ordered the bean tostada, and my husband ordered the burrito.  The food came out within a matter of minutes, if even that long.  It was the fastest service I have ever experienced, so quick that we hadn't even really tried the chips. After we received our food we inspected the plates, we noticed that the beans on my husband's burrito were whole beans, and my tostada had refried beans.  This is huge red flag to us, as some restaurants still use lard in the beans.  We asked Jose if there was lard in the beans and he confirmed that there was. Well, I was unable to eat my tostada after that, never even took one bite. It looked great, I'm sure it was, just not for me.  My mistake for not asking about the beans before we even sat down. Been vegetarian for over 20 years and made a rookie mistake; lesson learned (again).  The chips, salsa and beer were great!  My husband offered part of his burrito, I declined and stuck with chips, salsa and beer.  He said his burrito was good.  I, in no way fault Jose, as he was extremely helpful and attentive!  I just wish we would have warned about the animal lard when we said we were vegan.    It's really too bad, because my husband and I would have been regulars, as we really enjoyed the service and atmosphere of the establishment, but we will not be returning.  There are many Mexican restaurants in town were we can eat.  Over the years, I have seen this location change from different restaurant to different restaurant.  I was really excited to try this place. I wish them the best.",

It was Friday night and I understand that they are very busy. I think they were automatically biased with us since we were young. The service wasn't great. My friends never got there water after telling our server multiple times. When we asked to get more bean dip and chips the food runner acted like it wad the hardest job ever. And it took a while for our food to come out. Now I understand that it was a couple months ago.

The taco had a large amount of shredded chicken in a crispy shell. Both of the tortillas were fresh as we could see a woman making them behind a glass window inside the restaurant.  My friend ordered the chicken fajitas and a huge portion was served on a sizzling plate. Equal portions of chicken and tons of veggies along side guacamole, salsa, beans, rice and fresh warm tortillas.

The only downside is that when the server went to the manager in charge he explained the situation and the manager decided to charge us the coffees anyway. And I don't mind paying for what I have but that made me think that they don't appreciate the costumers. They don't care if we come back or not.

Still not like back home. But it hits the taste buds right where I need it.  The chips and salsa are top notch. I like that they give you bean dip too. The guacamole isn't is good as the ol ladies. But the best thing they have is the white cheese dip.  They have a couple waiters who are really funny. And I have never had to wait really long to be seated. Sometimes it takes a while to get refills so I usually compensate with ordering a tea and a water. The food is good so I don't mind.   Try either this location or the one downtown. Both are good I just like to spend my money at the location closest to my house.",

I was eventually greeted and decided to go in the bar. The hostess could maybe smile more and greet. Minor point. Service by the bartender was prompt and pleasant. I got the guacamole which I always do. I have to admit, it was a little more creamier than previous visits at the other location. While waiting for my main meal, I notice how clean the restaurant is. I recieved my enchiladas and rice. Came out piping hot and it was delicious. I ate all of it.   Kudos to the staff and owners.  You have another hit.",

But trust me, everything starts to taste the same at Casa Don Juan.  I'm not usually here by choice.  When I'm here, it's probably because one of my co-workers wanted to come here and I was out voted.  I should investigate the voting, but I'll just let it go. I'll play it safe and get their fajitas. A big plate with very little substance is what you get at Casa Don Juan.  Only about 25% of the plate is the meat.  The rest is the cheap stuff like the rice and the beans.  The tortilla chips they give you is very inconsistent. Some days, they're perfect, fresh, and airy.  Other days, they're hard, greasy, and salty.  Price for a meal here isn't the best considering what you actually get.  If there's a shining moment to Casa Don Juan, then it's the service.  The servers here are marvelous. Overall, the food is just okay. I've had better.  2017 Yelp Review #82",

    "text": "Update - June 2015  The last time we got our usual takeout, it was subpar and bland. I'm hoping it was just an off night but I was really disappointed when I got home and opened the carnitas platter. I was even more disappointed when I tasted it =(  I was hesitant to come here after the over-priced, bland food we got at their downtown location a few years ago. But we live right across the street from this new location and the other restaurant we had planned on going to had a 30 min wait.   I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and flavors once our food arrived. I breathed a sigh of relief after the first few bites because I was expecting to be disappointed and to swear this restaurant off forever. I hope they keep it up since we live so close and it's nice to have a Mexican restaurant in this area. The service was stellar. Even the busser was incredibly friendly and super prompt clearing our plates or bringing extra chips/salsa.  The only downside was that the salsa was a bit disappointing and I still think the food could have used a tad more seasoning, but overall it tasted good. We had the carnitas platter for 2. It was the perfect amount a food for 2 but we're kind of little piggies and eat a lot. 2 normal people might have some leftovers to take home. The homemade flour tortillas were so yummy and filling! I am looking forward to going back.",

    "text": "First impressions say a lot, we were greeted with huge smiles and a gentleman opening the door. The manager sat us and was very polite.   The salsa was meh, not much flavor and it isn't very chunky. We did like that the beans came with the chips. They don't offer any other salsa for free, I wish they had a salsa sampler. The green salsa or red salsa which are other options were $1.99 the habenero salsa was good in flavor and had a little more kick at to it, 4 chips in a row and you will for sure feel the heat. $2.99.    My husband had the steak burrito wet and felt that the Asada was amazing. I had the chicken chimichanga the special portion and it was absolutely delicious, one of the best I have ever had. The chimichanga when ordered at most places can come to greasy or lacks in quality meat and cheese. This was top notch.   Beans are important! These beans taste homemade. A  rare find in this Las Vegas version of Mexican food.   The waiter was great, he let us know about their happy hour which we took advantage of. Here is the deal, the happy hour will be running about 3 months while they are first open and runs from open until close! 2 for 1 margaritas, beers at the right price. $2.50 to start. After we had our food and margaritas, the manager came by to make sure we were taking advantage of the happy hour as well! That is great customer service.  I am actually not a fan of rice and beans however; theirs were on point. Real, authentic and tasty.   Margaritas were good as well, I  prefer a little more taste of tequila to mine but at least they weren't filled with too much sweet and sour.   We were continuously checked on by both the manager and the server. Which was refreshing.   The music was low which I normally prefer but this time around I wish there was a live band to shut the woman sitting next to us up. She was on the phone ignoring her lunch date and being loud. Talking bad about other people. Everything else was amazing. People need to have more respect for others.   The only downside other than miss chatty Cathy was that we finished our meal and margaritas before getting the check. I prefer to have the bill by the time I finish my food.   Must go! Enjoy!",

We ordered stuff that we had to ask multiple times for. The chicken enchiladas there are bland and the red sauce taste salty and likes can off spaghetti O's! The fresh flour tortillas were burnt and  brittle. Ordered my picky kid a basic burger and fries to have the fries be frozen in the middle! Come on really? Two stars for the friendly staff and quick seating but food wise go elsewhere people",

We walk in to be sat but there's apparently an employee gathering at the hostess stand, so we are ignored by 5 employees for 2-3  minutes before we're taken to our table. After being sat, we are greeted by our server who seems nice but then another server comes over to basically tell him to take a hike bc he's taking our table. He did it right in front of us, causing some tension between the two & the new guy seemed to be kind of a dick with an ego. Then I start looking at the menu & EVERYTHING is so overpriced! We just left. It was just awkward.... Felt like they didn't care how they present their restaurant or themselves to their customers. I spent my money elsewhere that night......",

We used to go to the original Casa Don Juan downtown near strip - still will if we are in the area - but are so happy to see that they have opened up in Summerlin!  Ask for Jose as your server - you will be very pleased by his quality.  ALTHOUGH, everyone there REALLY TRIES THEIR BEST TO GIVE YOU A VERY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE.  Try it - you will not regret it!! The new restaurant has been nicely decorated and has great options for seating also. We love the carnitas, fish tacos & their La Mexicana CDJ  salad.  Their salsa is fantastic, as is the bean dip. Freshly made tortillas and great fresh not-greasy tortilla chips for a starter.",

He was pushing the Gold Margaritas, so 3 of us ordered them. We should have asked the price. We definitely weren't expecting $14.00 each. Probably won't go back very often, because of the service.",

So first i tell my self hey this place is new i love the classy sign  I'm gonna try this food also because a good mexican spot doesn't really exist in Summerlin. So it all began when i opened the door and saw 2 Angels at the register, one was a server one was i believe the hostess, they greeted me with happiness. Even was curious enough to ask about my day which then i explained. Then unfortunately i was in a time crunch so i couldn't dine in. So i did what any other logical person would do  and i ordered the regular burrito with carne to gauge what type of place this gonna be. Me and the two angels continued to talk while i sat patiently on the very comfortable seating area they have made for us patrons. Where then i started to notice all the amazing decor in this classy place Mr.Don Juan and im sure his beautiful family own. So i get my food i wish them a great day. I get to my car i start to look in the bag AND GUESS WHAT? CHIPS AND SALSA.!!! I didn't know i got free chips and salsa with the burrito. The Salsa was so good i ate all of it before i got home, making me wish i ordered extra salsa(get extra salsa if you go here) finally i get to my desk where i am sitting now excited to see what the burrito tasted like. Ever heard of love at first Bite? As i bit into the burrito i could no longer see straight all i saw was hearts and stars, just as you might see in a looney tunes cartoon. Burrito to say the least was a 10 it reminded me of this other amazing restaurant i enjoyed while i lived in San Francisco. It held its form perfectly and didn't get soggy and every bite was filled with deliciousness. Thank you Mr Juan or Don. I will be returning here for my birthday party as long as that awesome happy hour is still around! If you love yourself go here. I want to see this place stay in summerlin forever!",

The manager was very kind and turned the music way down in the area where we sat, per my request.  I will be coming back again and recommending it to my friends!",

I do with they were all the same types of foods. I do like how the staff dress up for the look of the themes. This location is busy a lot I have been twice and it seems like they are always busy. They do have good prices on items and you do get a a lot for what you pay. I would go to this location again because the service was not bad and the food was good. I do like food when it comes out hot and steaming you know its fresh and good!",

Chicken burrito with verde sauce was maybe the best green sauce I've ever had. Chii relleno was awesome and the chicken fajitas were really good. They Give you bean dip with the chips. The bean dip and salsa are really good which is always a good indication that you're going to like your food. The reason for the four-star is that they had a TV that was tuned to a channel where they were doing a surgery. It was quite gross while eating dinner. The waiter did change the channel once we mentioned it.bThe other reason is that the women's bathroom was disgustingly dirty. So much so that had I gone to the restroom upon arrival I would have left without eating.",

    "text": "I have been to this location a number of times with different friends and family members.  I even asked my son to take me here for Mother's Day this year.    My parents decided to impromptu take my hubby and I out for Mexican food to celebrate our recent anniversary.  My dad had seen my posts and reviews of Casa Don Juan and suggested we go there.  My mother, hubby and myself were all in agreement.    It was a Sunday night and very busy!  We arrived and told the hostess there would be 4 of us.  She said it would be a few minutes and we went to sit down in the waiting area.  My father uses a cane so we made sure he had a seat.  There was one other couple sitting and waiting to be seated as well.  We were all a little irritated when some customer left their heavy fold up chair on the waiting lobby bench, requiring two of us to stand until the other couple were seated and the other bench was free.  The staff saw the seat in the way, but made no attempt to move it or apologize for it being in our way.  When we were seated the hostess inquired as to whether we wanted to order some white sauce or guacamole with chips.  I asked the price of the white sauce - $6.50 she said.  I'm thinking kinda pricey, but it's probably delicious and in a decent size bowl for everyone.    What a huge disappointment!!!  The white sauce was in a small size salad dressing bowl and was (as referred to by my hubby - Soupy Sales\")  it was so thin it just ran off the chips.  I immediately asked my family members if this was worth $6.50 - we were all disappointed but continued to sample.    When our waiter came to take our order I told him of our disappointment with the sauce and price.  He said he was sorry and returned to the kitchen.  I could tell he didn't care one bit!  Dinner was served and it was delicious  Then some man was making his was around the restaurant asking how everything was, so I told him about the white soupy sauce.  He looked at the bowl and said - looks like you're eating it.  I said well it costs $6.50 and that's too much - I think he was the manager (who knows) he definitely didn't know how to relate to a disappointed customer.  Guess what he did - NOTHING - just turned and walked away!  Totally unacceptable for someone in his line of work!  The food was delicious and we all enjoyed our dinner and conversation, until it was interrupted by an extremely LOUD and LONG version of some celebratory song for someone who was no where near us.    At this time I'm unsure if I would go back to this location in the future.  The obvious non caring attitudes of the manager and staff far out way the need to eat here.",

You can tell that Jose runs a tight ship and ensures all guests are treated and visited by him during their meal and ensure all is well.  Hands down one of the best local Mexican restaurants in Summerlin. Love this place, I have the original Casa Don Juan located just a few miles from us, but we rather drive a bit further and have a great time with great staff. They all look like they enjoy working at this place...",

She was about to seat us in a booth near the front door not in the main dining area anyway so it was definitely out of the way.

My order was also wrong.. ordered two chicken Tamales with green sauce, received a dry rubbery cheese tamale.    Called the store to try and be compensated in some way. Was in hold forever and then basically told they weren't willing to refund anything. They gave me two options.. drive to their store and pick up what missing. Which was unreasonable considering the fact that if I did so my food would be cold. Second they offered to put me on some list that would give me a discount next time I came to their restaurant. Told them neither worked for me and I just wanted a refund. The girl I was speaking with replied with.. soooo what do u want to do. Told her again that I wanted a refund. She then put me back on hold. When she came back she said the inly option would be for me to drive to their store for a refund. Told her I placed the order online and would like the money returned the same way it was received. She said they couldn't do that and I had to drive to them.   So I hung up with them and called Yelp directly as the order was placed through them. They promptly gave me a refund and made sure I was happy with their service. Thank you Yelp!   Overall this place is overpriced. My tamale was shaped like a ball.. and filled with cheap rubbery cheese. Considering their tamales cost $7.00.. you would think they would use premium ingredients. Ive had tamales for a dollar that tasted better than theirs. They are greedy with the accommodations and the sauce I did get was almost spoiled.",

While taking care of us, they both were very adept at handling a large table of seniors. They were kind, polite and extremely patient!! What great employees - please let them know we think they're rockstars!!",

    "text": "I saw a picture of the carne asada plate and a chile relleno on Yelp, and both looked amazing. That's what drew me in. I dragged my boyfriend here for dinner 12/13/15. It was around 4pm when we arrived, so we were seated immediately. Chips, salsa and bean dip were brought to the table. Nothing to write home about, just cheap fillers.  My boyfriend was a bit under the weather so he wanted soup. Our server informed us that they do not serve soup on the weekends? Huh? I think there may have been some confusion because I have never heard of that before. Usually, soup is served on weekends only and not during the week. Plus, there were 4 or 5 different soups listed on the menu. I wanted to clarify, but he had already decided to get something else. He ended up choosing the beef fajitas, and I chose the carne asada plate. We also got a chile relleno to share.  The chile relleno was $5.99 and it was tiny as hell. I didn't like it AT ALL. The cheese was not even melted inside! It didn't look anything like the picture, which was a lot bigger and much cheesier. Super disappointed with that, and at $5.99 it's a total rip. The carne asada plate looked good though. Lots of grilled onions topped the steak. The steak lacked a bit of seasoning, but was still good and perfectly medium as I had requested. The onions really added an extra depth of flavor when combined with the steak. The rice and beans were meh. I don't usually like Spanish rice anyway, and this was no exception. The beans were the same beans from earlier, just with a sprinkle of cheese on them. I did like that the tortillas were homemade, they were really delicious.   The service was pretty crappy. Our server was running around the dining room, so I knew he was busy, but we unfortunately suffered because of this. Our waters went unfilled for quite some time, and he never came back to check on us. It wasn't until we got a bus boy's attention that we were finally given service. He kept apologizing and telling us that he was sorry for the lack of service but they were going through a shift change. I appreciated his efforts. Finally after our server came and cleared all the plates, it was another 10 minutes while we waited for the check. This was totally not okay. I will not be back. For both of our meals, it was right around $45, with tax and tip.",

The servings tho are much smaller than the Don Juan restaurant downtown on Main Street. The customers are completely different. They cater more to the white retired/upper class people. Which is okay, it's just different vibe than original location. I'd rather drive the extra mile to downtown restaurant for serving sizes and the diversity of customers. Plus the waiters at summerlin location check on you every 10 minutes, but it feels as if it's every 5. Where as the other location doesn't check on you rarely at all. So that's a thumbs up to summerlin. Restaurant decor in summerlin is decorated to make upper class family feel more comfortable. Main St location is all Frida out and very authentic feel to it.",

Finally after waiting 30 minutes a server came to take our order.the pork chilie verde flavor was perfect but I haf to cut over 1/4 of fat from the prrk. I wouldn't order it if I ever come back. Unless the fat was removed.  The carne asada was great. #4 rellano & enchilada doesn't meet with our standards. The Flan is grainy, not our idea of a good flan. We wouldn't come back. Too bad we had hoped we finally had a good Mexican Rest. In Summerlin. It's not Don Juan's.. And we were still presented with a full check. Not comming back.",

Delicious food, I had the huevos rancheros, my husband had the chicken/enchilada combo,. Tortilla lady made fresh tortillas there in front of us and they were so yummy. The other thing I appreciated was the service. The people were extremely attentive and I'm sure they are a big reason the restaurant is successful. Raul was a especially great. We actually went back the next day and had the same great meal and the same great service.",

And the food was extremely well executed, I had sopes which were homemade and very good, my friends had the mole such was a classic version of a michoacan style mole, very good, and also we had a seafood soup which my friend said had a great flavored broth. Would highly recommend this place. Also had the lavender margarita and a few micheladas, all were awesome.",

Its for the stellar staff of C d J. Ate lunch there yesterday, with a friend from out of town. I was playing with my ring (its custom-made and I saved for a long time to get it), because my fingers hurt. I must have taken it off, and forgot to put it on, when our food came. It got left behind :-( This morning when I noticed, I frantically called every business and friend I had been to yesterday. When I finally called Casa don Juan, I had all but given up hope. But the nice lady there said, \"Yes, I have it here.\" We tried to offer her and the staff member who turned it in a reward, but they wouldnt accept it. So we promised to write a review and eat there more often :-) Which we are glad to do! Their carnitas finally gave me a reason to use the word \"unctuous\". My friend raved about her cocido soup. My husband loves their seafood. Not to mention complimentary chips, bean dip, and (yummy) salsa. This is not the cheapest Mexican food in town...but its a \"destination\". Wonderful Mexican decor. Sweet waitresses dressed as Frieda Kahlo, and jolly waiters dressed in mariachi-type outfits. AND a lady who turns out endless fresh tortillas from the griddle at the center of the restaurant. Go for happy hour to get a price break on drinks; or order their authentic (non-alcoholic) aguas frescas. And be sure to ask what desserts they have....and save a little room for one :-)",

There was no wait - we eat late, and were led to a very small booth right away.  If we had stayed there, the food would have had to sit on our laps.  But it was no problem to change to a table so that the food and my purse could be comfortable.  Our waiter, Jose B., was excellent.  He brought Herb a taste of the draft Modelo Especial, and before we ordered he brought him some of the mole sauce to taste, too, so he could see if it was too sweet, as it often is at other places.  We enjoyed the bean dip and salsa that came with the complimentary chips.  The dip was warm and the salsa just spicy enough.  The chips weren't the best I've ever had, but they were fine, and unsalted, the way I like them.  I had a decently priced glass of wine with a fairly generous pour, and Herb's $2.50 Modelo was a bargain.  I ordered the fajitas and was able to combine chicken and shrimp for $14.95.  I don't quite get why some of my fellow Yelpers find the prices outrageous here.  There aren't many Mexican restaurants that sell fajitas at this price, and they always charge more for shrimp. (There is a $2 upcharge for choosing the steak and shrimp combo).  Moreover, the amount of meat, especially the shrimp, was enormous.  It came with frijoles, rice and guacamole.  As usual, I forgot to ask for regular beans rather than refried.  I had expected just a thimbleful of guac, but the portion didn't seem that much smaller than the one ordered as an appetizer by some nearby tables.  In contrast to some other reviews, the fajitas arrived sizzling, the onions weren't overly caramelized or disproportionately overabundant, and the lettuce was fresh, too. I took home half of my dish, along with all the tortillas, rice and beans that I couldn't finish.  My husband's mole, so often thick and gloppy, was a much lighter version here, and red, rather than dark brown.  It's definitely not as rich, but that's a good thing.  There are many different kinds of mole, since each region in Mexico claims a different recipe as its own, and it was nice to see that it wasn't a copycat of every other place in town.  We sat in the Frida Kahlo room, truly a shrine to that artist, but really, the whole place is a feast for the eyes.  Authentic Mexican decorations abound, and it made me yearn for the days when I'd visit that country sometimes twice a year after my three summers in school in Guadalajara.  I asked a busboy if I could steal one of the big Mexican people sculptures lined up on a pony wall; he said he wouldn't tell, but the camera trained on them would record it.  Oh, well, my purse wasn't big enough, and besides, they were bolted down.  I checked.  :)  We really enjoyed Casa Don Juan and look forward to returning.  My only complaint was that Jose couldn't tell me how to say \"draft [beer] in Spanish!",

We loooooove any sort of hispanic food and theirs is killer. They have fantastic rice and beans and they give you ships salsa and beans when you first sit down as appetizer and it's super tasty so don't fill up on it.  Their super burrito is so good I love the green sauce it's a little spicier than the red.  Their Steak plate is super good and they cook the steak to order and it's so soft and tender that you can cut it with a knife with a little grilled jalapeno on the side OMG so bomb!  Their shrimp plate is bomb too I love the sauce it's in.  Can't go wrong with anything they have!  And get the 2 for 1 beers or one of their specialty drinks they have a full bar!  Anyway! This place is awesome and you need to try it out!",

    "text": "ZERO STARS!!!  EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISk!!!  My client from China was in town and wanted to eat \"Mexican\". We decided to go here as my gf has previously had a good experience at the downtown location.   The place was virtually empty with only one other table occupied. We ordered quite the spread, from guacamole, to the sea food sampler, tamales, fajitas, enchiladas, burritos, enough food that the waiter asked when the rest of the party is arriving.   Oh, how can I forget, we also order 2 horchata's and a water.   The water came out quite fast, but after a more than 5 minute wait, no sign of the horchata. I got out my seat to ask the waiter where the other drink were (it was a little awkward with my gf and client watching me downing my water with our chips and salsa). The waiter told me that it was coming out shortly as the current batch \"smelled sour\" and that a \"new batch is being made\".   I accepted his response and went back to my seat. A few minutes later I saw our waiter come out of the kitchen with the two glasses of horchata.   Before he approached our table, he stopped to speak to the manager. The manager then proceeded to take one of the glasses of horchata off our waiters tray, smelled the horchata, then proceeded to do the absolute most unthinkable thing, he took a sip of the horchata, placed the glass back on the tray, and nodded yes to the waiter.   At this point my jaw dropped to the table. As my mind was still processing what just happened, the waiter came over and served the 2 glasses of horchata to our table without hesitation.  I looked at the waiter and asked him what are you doing serving these to us? I said no one is drinking these, nor are we eating anything here! (The waiter looked at me and realized that I saw what happened). He said he was \"sorry\" and asked me to    \"allow\" him to \"deliver better service\".  By now, I was already standing up and telling my gf and guest that we're leaving.   Never got to try anything beyond the chips and guacamole and Las Vegas tap water.  *Health Department complaint was filed*  Now, You have been warned!",

First off, they have patio searing which will be a huge hit for us come spring.  We love eating outside.  The bar area is very colorful & is separate from the restaurant.  ALL of the staff was extremely friendly and went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of.  No less than 3 people were at our table regularly checking in on us.  Our server Christian, was fabulous.  Very attentive!! The food is just as good as the downtown location that everyone loves. Had the #35 - super burrito with chicken & loved it. I'll be getting that again.  The salsa they serve first is so fresh & I can't get enough of it.  My hubby a favorite is the cheese sauce (dip) with jalapenos - he said that should be put on every dish!",

This location has a fabulous outside eating area, which was perfect to try out with the long waiting line.  The chips and salsa were fresh, however not the best I have ever had.  The margaritas were super!  The Cadillac was my fav of the day...:). The service wasn't bad, especially considering how busy they were on a Sunday afternoon no less!  The prices were a little high I thought considering the portion sizes and it was lunch time.  Really there wasn't much difference between the lunch and dinner prices.  While this won't make the top of our Mexican food list for LV, I would still recommend it was a solid option.",

ATMOSPHERE: Very nice decor (not as fancy as Pancho's-downtown Summerlin, but really adequate), clean in appearance, large outdoor dining patio and the parking was easy. SERVICE: Our waiter, Jose and his second Victor were both very attentive, friendly and outstanding! FOOD: The WINNERS were the Vuelve a la Vida Campecham (shared as an appetizer by 4 of us), the Fajitas (#24), the Chips and Sala (served pre meal at all tables) and the Guacamole (must pay for this to be added, but worth it). The Lingua (wet) Burrito (green spicy sauce) was very good, and the combo plate ordered fell into the same category. All in all, the dining experience was memorable and the \"value\" factor (ergo 5 Stars instead of 4) was exceedingly met! A definite RECOMMEND!  12/27/18 (Checked In) Another FABULOUS Family dining experience at Casa Don Juan! The names have changed...but the service has not! Both Danny(Table Attendant) and Johnathan(Waiter) gave us excellent service! Thank-you Johnathan and Danny! When you find a good thing, you stick with it...so, once again the table shared the Vuelve a la Vida-very good. Two orders of #24 Fajitas (one beef w/Flour Tortillas -very good, one chicken w/fresh made Corn Tortillas-good), one #3 (2 Enchiladas and a Beef Taco-very good), one Burrito Regular-good, and a #31 (Chile Relleno, Beef Enchilada and a Beef Taco-very good). Hot Chips, Salsa and Bean Dip were immediately provided for our table of 5. Nice!  We ordered two Cocktails: a Pina Colada-WOW and a Margarita-excellent! Dessert followed this feast: 2 orders of the Chocolate Cake-excellent!  The total dining experience, in this YELPER'S opinion was worth another 5 Star and a \"highly recommend\" review for Casa Don Juan.",

I told her we would squeeze in to a booth I guess...and the waiter told her that it would be too tight for him to walk through-even though I wasn't going to put a chair on the end. At any rate, I let her know we'd go somewhere else...as we left there were several parties of 3 seated at tables that could fit 6. Perhaps if they didn't front load people in the wrong sized tables they would have enough room for larger parties that arrive. Oh well, they lost business from a big group.",

Upon arrival, we were greeted by a hostess who brushed us off very quickly after telling us to wait five minutes. After being seated we were greeted by our waiter who was amazing! The complimentary chips, salsa, and beans were delicious. We ordered and our food arrived very quickly. All of the food was great but I would say their only downfall was the Mexican fried ice cream, which actually wasn't fried at all just covered in fruity pebbles but it was still good either way.   Overall, I would definitely come back and try new things. They are the first place that has almost nailed \"authentic\" enchiladas.",

It's a good place to stop by.   When yelp says hey have vegan options, they shouldn't be just chips and rice. I wish there was a disclaimer somewhere that because this is more \"authentic\" Mexican food, the beans are made with lard. Our waiter informed us of this after we asked. We would have probably eaten elsewhere if we had known when we had walked in. The fresh salsa was excellent. The theme and atmosphere is definitely great though. The entire restaurant is Frida Kahlo themed.",

Coming from a San Diego born Mexican it's really hard to find good Mexican food in Vegas this place has a few good things but overall falls into my category of meh Mexican food! What saves them is great service our waiter was new and didn't know much but he's was kind and willing to find out for us. He also brought me some spicier salsa it was an habanero one that was barely spicy and didn't help much. The tortilla s are hand made so are very delicious. The rice and beans are edible which to me is surprising and The restaurant is cute the outdoor area is very spacious and shaded for nice afternoons. I've also had huevos rancheros at the downtown location and they were actually pretty good! Maybe since this was a different location they use a different sauce. I might be back to try their lunch or dinner but I'm not overly optimistic. Sometimes homemade is the only way to get what I want!",

    "text": "Went here because of \"rave reviews\" from a coworker of my husband. They serve complimentary chips , salsa and bean dip but immediately try to up sell you into ordering guacamole. If you order another bowl of chips they charge you $3.50!  What is up with that?!  We recognized our waiter Jose from Dona Maria's and he told us very hush hush that he no longer works there, the whole time looking around like somebody might overhear him. As for the food... Well it was very disappointing. I ordered the chicken tamale with green sauce with a cheese enchilada and my husband ordered the pork tamale with a taco. First of all the rice was mushy and reminded me of rice that is cooked in a bag, the refried beans were bland, as for the enchilada sauce-- it was extremely void of flavor, just salty. The chicken is cooked without sauce and then has a splash of sauce added to it before being placed in an excessive amount of masa. As a tamale connoisseur and excellent tamale maker myself this was just plain blasphemy. Margaritas were very watered down.  Drank two because it was two for 1 and never got a buzz. Definitely not a do over for this place.",

The food was outstanding, although a little expensive for Mexican food.  We were served by Lozada and he couldn't do more to please us and make us feel welcomed.  The restaurant is very pretty inside - great environment.  The handmade tortillas were to die for!!  This is a must go to restaurant for good Mexican food.  Cooked perfectly with wonderful flavor.",

Also all the staff that came upon us was super friendly ,which is always great. Ordered, and within less than 5 minutes my food was served. On top of all that, the water is actual water and not tap water. Seriously a great place to eat. 10/10 would eat here again.",

Took the server less than 1 minute to drop of food from time he left our table. . The tamale was allll masa with a hint of pork. $3.50 extra each to make a beer a michelada. Really?? Cost more than the beer!!  2 oz of \"cheese dip\" for $6.50!  It was basically cream cheese sour cream and a couple slices of jalapeno. Tasted like straight sour cream.   The one star is for the service. Server was really nice and friendly.   Left feeling cheated. DEF not \"authentic\" Mexican food. More like cheap Mexican fast food but a lot more expensive.",

I don't know how you can call it a lunch \"special\" when your choice of ONE taco or enchilada, with rice and beans, is $11. Even a burrito is $10, and it's $2.50 to add cheese. Ridiculous.  Got a $10 order of nachos with carnitas and they were mediocre. Chips were super greasy, as if they were dumped directly from the fryer into the box. Carnitas were simultaneously fatty and dry. 80% of the toppings on my order were pico de gallo.  I guess their prices have to be high so they can keep paying their enormous staff: anywhere from three to seven employees were behind the front desk during my visit. They easily outnumbered the customers, and yet bickered over who was going to take my order.  TLDR: Overpriced & overstaffed.",

I had to get up from the table and ask him politely if we could order.   After our food came, he never checked on us.   He came to check on the tables next to us several times, but not once checked on us.   Our drinks stayed empty.   I even had to grab his attention to get our bill.

The lady at the front did not even acknowledge me.  I complimented her flowery headband and told her that I was meeting some friends. She just pointed and said that they were sitting at the back.  So I proceeded towards where my friends we sitting.  The restaurant was okay.  It was large enough, but the seating area were just too close together.  David, the waiter was really nice.  He's the reason I gave this place a 1-star, otherwise, I would have given it 0.  He immediately took my order.  My \"limonada\" took awhile before I got it.  I was parched so I sipped that drink like there's no tomorrow.  Ii didn't get asked for a refill.  I only ordered 3 tacos, and it took forever to get to me.  Everyone at the table were done with their food at this time.  I was snacking on the chips, which by the way tasted really stale.  The busboy took the salsa I was dipping the chips in and when I told him I was still using it, he tried to put it back on our table, ahem, I don't think so.  His thumb was inside the bowl touching the salsa.  No way, Jose.  I asked if I can get a fresh bowl of salsa and lime.  He said that he will get it for me.  Still waiting for my tacos.  Still waiting for the salsa and lime.  Hmmm.  They must have forgotten me.  David handed me my bill and I haven't even received my food yet.  LOL!!!  45 freakin' minutes later, I finally get my tacos.  Still no salsa and lime.  I had to ask  again if they can bring me a fresh bowl of salsa and lime.  Nothing extraordinary about the tacos.  Tough meat, guac, small diced tomatoes and a few leaves of cilantro in a soft taco shell.  I only ate one and picked the other two.  3 tacos and a medium size drink....$16.  WTH!!!! I could have treated all my friends with that at Taco Bell.  Lol.  And as we were handed the bill, David informs us that tip was not included in the bill.  He said that normally the tip in included but they forgot to add it.  OMG!!!  Overall, I will not be coming back.  There's a lot of Mexican restaurants in town that I can truly say is very authentic and delish and this place is definitely not one that I will come to again.  Try it for yourself.  Things could be better for you.  This is just my opinion",

    "text": "VERY DISAPPOINTED with Casa Don Juan! Let me spearhead this. Our son is in the military and is home on leave this week. One of his request was to go to his favorite Mexican restaurant because he says the Mexican food is generic where he is stationed at! Granted, we live in Las Vegas and our son has so many choices, but he wants Casa Don Juan.  Our experience was like a firework. It started off beautiful then the service and staff fizzled out. Our server who shall be nameless, was personable, however when he received another table he became overwhelmed and forgot about us. He didn't check on us once after we received our food. Our drink cups were empty through the whole meal because our server was focused on the other table. Had to wait forever for the to go boxes and check. Then to make our evening from bad to worse.... We are at the register ready to pay and our server specifically tells the cashier VALERIA that our son is military and to give the military discount. Our son pulls out his Military ID to show and Valeria says \"go ahead put it away, I heard that you are in the Army!\"  So, she takes our payment and says \"OH, I FORGOT TO GIVE YOU THE MILITARY DISCOUNT!!!!!\" Kind of a coincidence after she processed our payment. Then VALERIA says I can run it again and give the military discount but your first payment will still be charged until I have it canceled. At this point I'm frustrated because my card is gonna be charged over $200 for mediocre service, food below expectations, and an incompetent cashier.  My heart is heavy because  all we wanted was a meal with the whole family. Our Army son won't be home for the holidays and most likely we will not see him until next year! Casa Don Juan you ruined our evening and I'm sure I'll never here from any manager about this service. Next time, we will find a Mexican restaurant that is more appreciative of their customers and most importantly military friendly!",

We also had the guacamole and it was fresh and tasty.   We order combo plates for lunch. I got the chili relleno and cheese enchilada. The bf got beef taco and cheese enchilada. The food came out fast and was really hot. Everything was so delicious and flavorful.   There was no way we could have eaten dessert but they did have many choices.

Food was good, service was wonderful but when we went to pay the bartender snapped back that we couldn't pay at the front register we had to pay in the bar because it was a different system!  What?    Our server seemed to be busy and instead of waiting we went to the front register to pay.  Alex came out as we were walking out and we told him it was not a problem we would go out there.  When we walked up the bartender was at the cashier register and snapped at us like we were doing something wrong.    I told her we didn't have any alcohol she said it doesn't matter.   I said fine we would not be returning!  We walked back into the bar, gave Alex our check and he went out to ring us out and then came back in and closed it out in the bar!    How absolutely ridiculous.  We visit this establishment about once a month...not no more!  Goodbye!",

I had the carne asada plate, the meat was so fresh and had a great flavor. I am also obsessed with their Spanish rice. It was so good! A definite must try!",

Our bar server, Gabriela took such great care of us; she was simply amazing! All smiles, kindness and care from beginning to end. She is the kind of person that makes you become a regular. If I lived here I would definitely put this place in regular rotation.  They start you out with as much chips, salsa and refried beans that your heart desires. I loved how fresh the salsa was - SO good.   I ordered a mango margarita on the rocks and it was very good. Great start to our dinner. For our meals we ordered the super burrito and enchilada combos. Both were absolutely delicious.   Can't wait to return!",

We ordered carne asada and shrimp. It is listed that it comes with guacamole, rice, beans, and tortillas. I had less than a teaspoon of guacamole. The steak was over cooked and dry. There were 3 tiny shrimps, so coated in garlic you couldn't taste the shrimp at all. The tortillas are all hand made by the sweet abuelita in the tortilla station.   The kids ordered wet burritos and they were \"aight\". It's never good when your teenagers say Roberto's tastes better.

    "text": "The downtown Casa Don Juan is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas, with the location on Sunset a close second. Sadly, this branch is sorely lacking in both service and flavor.  It took a while to place our orders, and after lunch it took more than 15 minutes to get the bill after we asked for it. The restaurant wasn't very crowded, so I'm not sure what the problem was, but service was the first setback.  And then there was the food. Usually, the bean dip is our favorite part of the meal. But both my friend and I thought these beans were seriously underseasoned, as were the chips. My chicken mole was as good as ever, which bumps this review up a star. But my friend's rolled tacos were just meh, and she had to ask twice for a side of salsa verde to help flavor them up.  Not sure if this location was just having an off day, but at least I now know that if I'm craving Mexican food, there are two other Casa Don Juan locations that I can hit. I'll just steer clear of the Summerlin location...for now.",

The food tasted great and we liked the fresh tortillas. I got a mango margarita on the rocks but my husband wished they had other options in regards to hard liquor besides tequila. I thought the price was a bit high. For two people our dinner was $70 (b4 tip) but we purchased a groupon for $30 off. The $30 groupon was $14 so we technically saved $16. I also didn't like that they had to take my phone from the table to the front desk to redeem the groupon. I showed them a pdf version of it, but he wanted me to pull it up and actually took my phone and it was left with someone at the front desk to process. I think they should be able to redeem it once I show it to them at the table or communicate that it needs to be processed by someone else and I would have happily taken it up to that person. I didn't get our busser's name, but he was super awesome! He was totally on it and kept our drinks filled. He also hustled at getting tables clean so we didn't have to look at dirty tables. Great job!",

We started off with their chips and salsa and bean dip, YUM!  I had the traditional margarita and my guest had a watermelon margarita.  They pretty much have every flavor imaginable for margaritas.  We then had Guacamole for the table got our entrees!  We both went with Carne Asada.. my plate came with a cheese enchilada and my friends came with something different.  It was SO GOOD!  I'm super picky when it comes to meat but the quality was perfect.    We were so full we didn't save room for dessert but I definitely will save room next time.  Also at the front where you wait to get seated they have flan and different things you can buy to take home with you!  I will definitely be back and highly recommend you do too!  It was a bit far for me but they have several locations.",

There were several times that the drinks for certain people were not brought. When I asked for them to celebrate my mothers birthday, they asked me if she drank alcohol. I told them that she does not, but they still brought a shot of Tequila to her anyway. The buffalo location is average, but downtown I would give 5 stars.",

Also they have no happy hour which makes no sense in the area its in.

I was surprised when I got the bill at the price of my margarita. It tasted like mostly mix- like it was a .99 cent one at the casino. My hubby had the taco salad, and he said it was great!",

Amazing food, amazing service, and their own tequila brand is to die for. You can taste the amount of hard word that goes into this tequila. I started with the guacamole appetizer which was amazing and the homemade chips to boot. My girlfriend had the 2 enchilada plate with chicken piled high with rice and beans. Absolutely delicious!! I had the chile relleno, beef taco, and beef enchilada. It was so much food, but I devoured it!! Our server's name Billy and he was on point and an amazing salesman. We were trying to save room for fried ice cream but there was just no more room. Can't wait to come back next time!",

The fish dishes are always fresh. My wife loves the shrimp tostada for something on the lighter side. She also recommends the Cadillac Margarita! Muy bueno!! This is a family owned, local business and it shows. The service is always on point. A friendly staff always welcomes you upon arrival. Best in Las Vegas for sure!!! Forgot to mention the flan for dessert is always perfect. Enjoy!",

Unfortunately, what he didn't inform me of was that there would be a $2.50 charge for this. WTH? Why? Same amount of sauce, just a different type. Hmmm, that left a pretty foul taste in my mouth. Not sure if we'll go back. I realize $2.50 is not a huge amount, we spent more than that on their watered down margarita's, It was just the principle.",

The hostess was going to seat us in a booth next to the front window, so I asked if we could sit somewhere warmer.  What about that room in the back, I asked?  She said that room is closing (Two hours before closing time?!?). We got seated right behind the reception desk, first table as you turn the corner where every time the front door opened we got a cold... COLD blast of air. It happened to be 31 degrees outside and we thought a warm bowl of Cocido in a warm cozy Mexican restaurant would be nice.  BIG, I mean \"BIG\" mistake going to Don Juan in Summerlin.  Where the hostess frowned when I asked to be seated in a warmer area. The waiter made a joke when asked why it was so cold in there.  And looking around everyone left their jackets on while they ate, just like me?!?  I kept asking if they could please turn the heat on and they said they would, but it never came on. Leaving, I told the person at the register, \"Your food is very good, but too bad I'm never coming back.\"  Telling her about the situation she apologized and agreed that it is too cold in the place. She is the only employee that didn't look at me as if I were crazy!?!  In parking lot we asked a couple walking out what they thought and the wife said she had to drink six cups of coffee just to keep warm. Suggestion:  Casa Don Juan owner, TURN UP THE HEAT!!!  YOU ARE LOSING CUSTOMERS...Don't be so cheap!  (Cold @Main Street too!)",

First 2 times no sour cream when requested in the notes. 3rd time no horchatas we paid for and I even called in and asked as soon as I placed the order for extra sour cream on our quesadillas. Just a teaspoon amount was in the box. What a joke. For the price of $50 for 2 items and a dessert; you can probably get your moneys worth else where.

    "text": "At first glance the restaurant was decent but was quickly ruined by the poor customer service and terrible management. Our server Juan was talking to us too comfortably, since he assumed we where Hispanic, he started swearing when describing the food and ended up speaking Spanish more than English, even though we replied to him in English he continued speaking Spanish. Furthermore the food we had was alright but our issue came when my steak felt rubbery and undercooked. We let our server know if we can switch it for another entree and he said he can wrap up the food and order another entree and take it go instead of simply switching and removing the steak from our bill. I told him I'd rather not pay for a dish we won't eat and he said \"what do you want then mijo?\" in a rude way too, I told him what I'd rather have which was cheaper, and he walked away and came back with the manager Vicky. Thinking she would resolve this issue, she argued with us stating that the food wasn't undercooked and that it wasn't rubbery because she said she tried it off my plate. Either she lied to me or that is disgusting and extremely unprofessional. She's basically calling me a liar. I simply didn't like the taste and texture of the meat and that's my opinion whether or not she thinks it's fine. After our meal, we noticed the bill was never modified and we had to pay full price for a meal that only had a bite taken off the steak. The manager came back to argue even more stating that she pays a lot for her meat and refused to take it off the bill and switch it for the other entree. She also said that it's our fault we didn't like it and again she will not take it off the check. She was being very rude the whole time, we never interrupted her like she did to us and we never gave an attitude just how she did to us. I'm so disappointed and a little upset because I loved the atmosphere. After agreeing on taking 20 percent off the check we grabbed a business card so we can call the company, and walked away. As we where leaving the restaurant our server Juan stopped us as he was carrying food to another table and said that if we call the company tell the truth and don't lie. Why would we lie as if I'd ever come back to this restaurant? That was extremely uncalled for and I was offended by that and that made me very upset and I don't ever want to come back to an establishment that treats their customers so badly. Do not come to this restaurant if you don't plan on paying for overpriced food, terrible customer service and even terrible management.",

    "text": "Bear is the Mexican food freak in the family, and he is constantly on the lookout for great places.  Most of what we've had so far has ranged from pretty good to 'meh', so when he scoped out Casa Don Juan online, I figured that we didn't have a whole lot to lose trying a new place.    When we arrived, I recognized it IMMEDIATELY.  We do a lot of things around that area of Summerlin, and the Lyft cars I've been taking pass by this place all the time.  But I never thought to try eating here, so it was nice to finally get the chance.   First thing's first: it's always a good sign, when you walk into a Mexican place, and the first thing you see is an area where the tortillas are made fresh.  When I saw that was the case here, I couldn't help but smile on the way to our table. And yes, the chips and salsa we were greeted with was ALLA THAT.   The place itself is a bright, colorful repository of art and items that display pride in Mexican heritage.  If you didn't notice any of it, the menus sporting the images of famed artist Frida Kahlo and her other half, Diego Rivera, should be a dead giveaway.  Fresh-made tortillas help elevate any dish, and it was evident from the chicken flautas I started off with, all the way to the pork chimichanga, stuffed with so much tender, juicy meat that I barely finished it! So you KNOW we ended up skipping dessert. (Maybe next time).  As far as service goes, they have it down to a science.  Our server, Jose, was assisted by several other wait staff members, but I'd have to 'guesstimate' that we waited no longer than ten minutes for any courses we had, if THAT.   If I had any complaints, it's that the usual combo of sides - refried beans with cheese and rice - seemed as bland as it is at other restaurants we've tried.  The flavors of the entrees make up for it somewhat, but it would be nice to have the option of whole pinto or black beans. Which, to be honest, they may have - we didn't get the chance to ask.  But I will update this review with what we discover on our next visit.  Meanwhile, Bear FINALLY has found his \"Shangri-La\" for a decent plate of huevos rancheros.  And that to me says more about how good this place is than the fresh tortillas.  We WILL be back.",

My brother suggested it for lunch today and Mom and I proclaimed \"heck yes!\" We started with the usual bean dip and salsa, going through two baskets. We ordered a variety of items-Mom and brother each had enchiladas, I went with my usual order of chicken tacos, and my SIL went for the flautas. Everybody cleaned their plate and unfortunately, we didn't have any room for dessert! Juan was our server and he definitely had a big personality! We got there early for lunch, but our area filled up quickly and we still got the perfect amount of attention. Jared was bussing tables and helping Juan out and he was great as well. We definitely had awesome service. So glad to know we have a CDJ in our area. We'll be back!",

I tried the fajitas, both beef and chicken, both were okay but lacked that sizzling, authentic Mexican taste in the seasoning and smoky grilled flavor that accentuate the flavor of the meat. The sides of beans and rice were very small in proportion to the meat, and were lacking in flavor. Just when I thought the dishes could be somewhat salvaged by the salsa and guac', I was wrong, and both were bland as well. Service was almost non-existent. Our server wasn't as attentive as he should've been for a big party. If you don't really like your food seasoned or packing in flavor, then I guess this place might suit you, but then you wouldn't be able to call it authentic Mexican food. If you want a taste of amazing Mexican food, try Leticia's Mexican Cocina.",

The place was packed but they have a lot of seats so they found us a table immediately.   The wait staff was again very friendly and prompt. However, the waiter did misinform my son on what was in his dish so when it arrived, we had to send it back (the waiter was very apologetic).   I liked my chili relleno and beef taco combo the first time, so ordered it again. This time, the taco fell apart as it was served on a bed of grease, so I didn't enjoy that part but the relleno was tasty. My wife had the vegetarian burrito which was \"pretty good\" to her.    We also ordered queso dip with jalapenos- I'm not a big queso fan one way or another but my wife likes it and thought it was tasty.   Finally, I don't know what it is about ambient noise in this place but they had someone playing with the music and I guess someone on staff wanted it loud while another wanted it quieter and there was a war about it as it kept going up and down on the same song for like five minutes til the loud person won!  Overall, I think the food is good and will chalk up the other stuff to the place bring new and finding their groove. I'm not so sure if this place is as good as I thought it was after the first visit, but I think it has potential",

One start less the moment you read your bill and there is a $2.99 charge for the habanero sauce I requested.   I've eaten here half dozen times. The salsa is \"mild\" and acceptable. I understand the demographic placement of this restaurant so that's fine. Asked the waiter for something a little hotter... And boy did that burn on the way out - no pun intended. :-)   Spent $118 on 3 adults and 2 children. Shouldn't a salsa be complimentary on a $20 dish? It's not the 3 bucks- it's the principle.   Paid the bill anyway and refused to have the charge removed- that wasn't the point (but they missed that). The manager on staff schooled me on the need to charge for sauce. I don't feel I needed lessons on salsa. I have eaten at many Mexican cuisine restaurants. I am native Mexican. Never once have I paid $3 for 1oz of salsa.",

    "text": "We ordered pick up from this place.  The food was sub par. The order was missing items that we paid for.  We called to be refunded the money for what we did not get. They asked us to drive all the way back so they could swipe our card again.  Ridiculous to say the least!  When we asked them to simply put the money back on our card it took them 4 hours to figure it out after we gave them our card number 3 times and 5 phone calls later. So eventually they said they returned our money but in fact what they did was charge our card with the difference removed. So now we have to wait until the bank decides to give us the original charge back which can take up to 8 business days. We went from a $40 charge to a total of $73 charge because they failed to fill the order as placed. What a complete shame.   Please don't take this review as a sign not to eat here. We just didn't enjoy the food or the experience we had with them.",

The appetizer never came out, but the food was very good.   They have good chips and salsa... My favorite thing to order at most restaurants and bars... theirs is very good.   Pricing is competitive and inline with what you would expect to pay. Thankfully, it wasn't very fancy... It was traditional Mexican that most would expect.   Will definitely go back... check them out!",

That was upsetting. When they put the plate of food in front of me, right away the smell was weird not in a good way. They put cojita cheese on the chile relleno. Never do that. Cojita is almost the same as Parmesan. No, no, no. Does not work for me. Horrible smell, horrible taste. The rice and beans were nothing special. No Mexican flavor. No lettuce or cabbage on the plate. And it was expensive. I will never let anyone else choose a restaurant for me.",

She did not care we were returning patrons.  She did not care we had received this happy hour special before.  She did not care her signage clearly stated the specials. She did not care that her servers had already clearly stated the clearly posted specials. She did not want to honor her specials.  It's just the principle.

    "text": "It really hurts me to write this review, because I used to really really enjoy coming here all the time. I would come here at least once a week and I would bring my family or come by myself. The service was great, especially Juan, and I would always take care of my waiters and leave a nice tip. The food was one of the best in town!! Unfortunately, the last few times I've come here the service was BAD, it took forever for them to even acknowledge I was there. Then last night,  I tried sitting at the bar, and the girl behind the bar was not nice or friendly at all. When I had to ask for chips, salsa, to make an order she just had an attitude. I tried to address the manager/owner lady when walking out, asking her about Juan and trying to tell her how bad the girl was behind the bar, but she just kept ignoring me and pretty much just said, \"goodbye.\"   This is why I decided to leave an honest review because I used to truly enjoy coming here, but not anymore. If I were the owner/manager I would want to know if any of my employees were not being friendly or not providing excellent service. When Juan was there he would go above and beyond to welcome me with open arms. He knew what I used to always order. I noticed Juan was like this with all the customers that came in. Since I haven't seen him there, the service has dropped tremendously. One more thing I noticed was the chicken tacos I used to get had so much more chicken, then they do now. I really hope they make some changes in a positive direction, so i can come back and enjoy this place with my friends and family again. I know I'm not the only one that has been experiencing this poor service either. I used to talk about this place to all my friends and family and they all have agreed that the service is not the same anymore.",

We ordered one of the parrilladas it was nothing like the picture on the menu it had a lot of vegetables and little amount of meat and shrimp. Hand made tortillas are dry and hard. Food not worth the price. Gave 2 stars only because of the nice waiter even though he never apologized either for the wait but he was nice. Don't sit outside as there is a constant sewage odor.",

If your going to charge to the tune of $13 for a plate maybe you should quit being cheap and use all white meat !!! Or warn your customers of the lower grade , pink, chicken you use in your enchiladas so gross !! $25 bucks not well spent ! Iam so not happy !!",

When I think Mexican food, I think full of flavor and maybe even a little spice, but all of our food lacked that. Very disappointing and especially for the price. $30 for less than mediocre food for two people. I'm sure there are much better options in Vegas for that price. I'm giving this place one star because our service was fine. No complaints there. Our waitress checked on us multiple times and was super friendly.

Not the type of location to go for a quiet intimate meal. Deffinately the type of place where they would sing the birthday song if there was a birthday. Probably better for lunch than dinner. I will come back for lunch or a large event.",

I'm sure there are many, many, of you out there that certainly know what I mean! :(  We were very lucky to get a place that is really close to a lot of places. Especially places to chow down. Right? So. Since my honey is a HUGE fan of \"Good\" Mexican food. As fate, or the Carb Devil, would have it, we are like, maybe a quarter mile to a shopping center across the street on Buffalo. First place we spotted as we were out scouting was Casa Don Juan. HELLO, my honey says! So Casa Don Juan it is. The food and the atmosphere of that place was INCREDIBLE! The workers from front to back obviously know what they are doing. From a beautiful young smiling Senorita that greeted and seated us. To the staff that did the order taking to the ones that prepared that wonderful food and then the ones that serve it up... If you EVER see a Casa Don Juan and love Mexican food. Don't pass it up. I realllly mean that. It is that good.  Also:  Special shout outs to Alex and Juan Thank you for your coolness and kindness.....",

I had a lengua torta and the lengua was very tender and melt in your mouth. The bread was fluffy and light and all the other ingredients (beans, lettuce, tomatoes, guacamole, etc) made it a simple but balanced and most importantly delicious sandwich. My dining companion had the mole de pollo and she also loved it. Pretty big portions and we were thoroughly stuffed after. Maybe we shouldn't have filled up on so much complimentary chips/salsa/refried beans. Oh yeah and that guacamole we ordered.  Service was fast and friendly. I loved the uniforms the servers wear--extra bright take on traditional Mexican clothing.",

It was all pretty decent in taste but coming from California my taste in Mexican food is a little different. I will say that the delivery was quick but everything was stacked on top of each other so it did not stay well.   There was guac but it was a little runny and lacked flavor for my liking. Would I order this again for delivery....probably not unless I was going to have a party and feed a few people with it but I will probably order from here again.",

Instead of tortillas the layers were made of the same pastry as the taco bowls!! Very much enjoyed their take on a simple southwest breakfast.   The chips and guacamole were very tasty we ended up being offered to take home the balance of our chips and salsa for later.  Happy hour during the week from 4-6 with some good looking deal. Definitely plan to come back to try that.  Enjoyed some tap beer, cold and good size portions.",

We decided to come in with my parents and when we were greeted by the hostess Vicki/Victoria she was short/rude. We noticed that our favorite server David was working and reapproached the host area and asked to be seated in his section. Again we were met with an unprofessional manner. She stated \"that is reserved!\" My husband was taken aback by this display of unprofessionalism however we again continued to wait. When we were finally seated it was not with the requested server David. However David was able to trade with another server. In reflection I'd like to say that the hostess was the ONLY poor service we received. David and the manager Gabby were both kind and displayed all of the qualities we have come to appreciate and expect of the staff at Casa Don Juan. I hope that the hostess Vicki/Victoria is dealt with expediently as she has tainted our perception. Of course we will continue to visit and enjoy all of our favorite foods and see all the other amazing team members that make up this location.",

I asked David G our waiter  for extra lemons for my tea and he forgets , so I had to ask again. I ordered the carne asada with a little extra guacamole and again he forgets , the carne was bland , no flavor whatsoever , husband ordered the chili rellenos and they were super bland and cold, barely any sauce on them, both the flour and corn tortillas were a bit tough and cold . He NEVER once checked on us , we were kinda thrown in the back but that's no excuse .. he walked by a few times and looked in our direction but that was it .. we took what what left of the relleons and carne asada , I asked for a box and he brings ONE small box for both items , I just looked at him and he knew why!  We tipped him anyway but nothing close to the 20% we normally leave .. had he checked on us at least once it would've made a difference .. so with the food not being as good as it use to be this is our last time eating there , at least at this location .. unless the downtown location drops like this one , we won't go back back either .. tired of spending hard earned money on shitty service and food !!",

I've had limearitas with more taste. I hold the Margaritas at Lindo Michoacon as a comparison so this fell flat. The food was \"meh\" and overpriced. I will make the drive to Lindo on West Flamingo. BTW, for all you Margarita fans, try Nacho Daddy in Summerlin.",

Any restaurant that devotes an entire wall to paintings and photographs of Frida Kahlo deserves some extra credit. beware of upselling here. before we sat down..the hostess talks up their queso cheese dip and guacamole dip.  We agreed to the cheese dip sales pitch but at $6.50 and a very small portion..we were disappointed. Also...we ordered some margarita's with some \"premium\" liquor and thought $14 each was outrageous. Our server named Tirone was excellent. he and his assistant offered suggestions...told us some Mexico City stories..gave us extra chips and salsa... and refilled our water glasses when necessary. Food was fine. wife and I had cheese enchiladas with rice and refried beans. standard fare but good. My son had the chicken mole and proclaimed it excellent. overall..we got a lot of food and left happy. Place seems quite authentic.",

Their food is well prepared, hot, very tasty and nicely proportioned. Their staff has always been exceptional...well-dressed, courteous, accommodating and attentive. And when's the last time you saw a staff member at a restaurant...any restaurant...dusting the accent pieces with a Swiffer and using a broom and dust-pan to sweep a barely-noticeable scrap of paper off the floor. We're impressed with the quality and attention to detail  at this restaurant!",

Queso - shredded cheese in a box : / Now, two things; one every restaurant I have ever been to (between WA and TX) queso has been melted cheese dip. Two, I understand that the word means cheese. But since there are little to no descriptions on the food items, I went with what precious experience lead me to believe. In addition to this little dilemma, they didn't deliver our large coke. So after ordering $63 of food and not getting the queso (that I was expecting) and our coke, I called to let them know. This is where things got worse. The female who answered the phone was rude. There was no apology, just \"queso at our restaurant is shredded cheese and we refunded your money for the coke\". Needless to say, as good as the good was it wasn't good enough to make up for lack of customer service. There are PLENTY of Mexican restaurants in Vegas just as good and better.",

The moment of truth: we walk in and were greeted quickly. We got our table in about 10 min. The busser asked for our drink order. 5 min later the waiter comes and asks if that's what we ordered. Mind you it was water a magarita and a chocolate milk.   We ordered our food I got a combination enchilada Chile relleno and a taco. The taco was very greasy. Oh we asked for spicier salsa for our chips and we got charged 3.99! The enchilada tasted as if it was from a frozen package. My husband ordered the beef tongue. He asked for flour and corn tortillas and they actually only gave him one of each. When he asked for more they charged us for it. Never in my life have I been to a legitmate Mexican restaurant that charges extra for salsa and tortillas. And the kicker is every time we asked the busser for something like that salsa or those extra tortillas the waiter always came to our table and asked if we wanted that.  It was a huge disappointment and we will never go back. Service, food, atmosphere, and prices are why we will never go back to this location. I wish I could give it a 0.",

Serrano's still does it better. Much better. In flavor, in service with a genuine smile, in toppings( salsa bar at your beckon call). The food at casa don juan is mute.

Omar was my server and he was very attentive and nice, and there was another young man that was helpful as well. The thing that kinda bothered me was when we came in it was slow so all the servers were just standing around and it made me uncomfortable because I felt like they kept staring. The menu is much more expensive. My son loved the nachos from the previous owners so we decided to give theirs a shot, and I got two fish tacos. The tacos were about the same price but half the portion size, and I was super disappointed with the fish. It was tilapia but had a super fishy taste. I ended up taking it out and putting the meat from my sons nachos and putting it in my tacos. Wasn't super wowed.",

    "text": "Let me start of with the service. Let me tell you it was excellent. We grabbed a table outside and enjoyed the nice weather. The only drawback was the bees by the flowers.   We ordered a margarita and had chips and dip and it was really good. The margarita was actually pretty good also and pretty strong.   I had a wet burrito and my boyfriend had the chicken enchiladas. All was amazing and should have been since they make their own tortillas right there in the front.   I definitely will be going back again because i really enjoyed myself.",

    "text": "Been searching for a Mexican restaurant since we moved here 8 months ago. We finally found it! Tried it for lunch.  Great outdoor area. nice atmosphere, very clean.  Everyone was very friendly, fast service, white cheese dip vs yellow...we loved that! Complimentary chips, salsa & bean dip.  I ordered the Vegetarian Burrito, it was delish! It was also huge! The tortillas were fresh and homemade. Hubby ordered the special...both were $8.99ea, so much food, took half of each home.  Didn't try the margarita's this time (a little early) but sure will next time..soon!!",

    "text": "Sadly, this 1 star review is deserved. We had planned a day in advance for a large party on a Monday night. You think they would have been prepared for that. We were seated promptly but we waited an hour and 30 min for our food. When we got it, half of it was burned. Mostly the cheese quesadillas. The food was subpar. On a positive note, our servers were great and kept apologizing for the delay in getting our food to us. We were charged $14.99 for a cheese quesadilla with rice and beans. Ouch! I won't be back to Casa de Juan.",

Sweeter than I'm used to but excellent. Great margaritas without silly boutique prices. Fast friendly service. Planning our next trip.",

Being latin I am picky about Mexican food but this is good. This place use to be a place called chips and salsa before casa don juan moved in and chips and salsa was not good.  So it is great to have a Mexican restaurant in the area. Just one thing to beaware of is hidden charges which is the only downer  They offer cheese dip or guacamole but fail to tell you about an extra charge for it. So just ask if substitutions and extra items are an extra charge.  The food is very good though.",

They brought in immediately, This Server came in right after and brought us the salsa with chips and guacamole immediately as well. He took our order and it was unbelievable the speed in which the food came out. The chef in the back must be psychic knowing what we were going to order in advance. The food was fresh it was delicious. They totally have it together in this restaurant. Best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to and we eat out a lot.  I highly recommend it",

I love the food, not super traditional, but a cross of American Mexican and traditional Mexican. I love the tamales, cheese and Jalapeno are yummy.    Check out the new digs on Vegas & Buffalo.",
