    "text": "Really good noodle shop in Las Vegas! It's off the strip in Chinatown so the prices are affordable. I went with a group of people and no one complained about their food. We ordered a pork dumpling appetizer and for myself, I got the short rib noodle soup with a fried egg added at a level 2 (the woman laughed at me when I said level 3 so I dropped it down a notch). The short ribs were really tender and the broth was a mix of the fat from the short ribs, hot oil and bone broth. It was like velvet.  I'd go back again if I needed a noodle fix. The spice level was just right. If you want some noodles that aren't ramen, check out Mian.",

The flavor was amazing.  For the actual dinner I had Chengdu ZaJiang noodles with spare pork rib, intestine, and Medium spice. The spare ribs were really good, and the intestine had a good flavor to it as well. The noodles on the other hand were phenomenal. The medium spice still had me sweating through it, but I definitely couldn't stop eating it was so good. We also had Pork dumplings which were awesome as well. The service was great. Everyone that served our table was awesome.They were all on it with bringing the food and filling our cups with that great bean soup. Which also helped with the spice of the noodles.

    "text": "I've seen this place on yelp a few times and finally went yesterday after a friend recommended it. You can adjust the spicy level, we were told it's Mild, Medium or Regular. Per the waiter, Regular is the spiciest, but my bf said it wasn't very spicy, also said his order was bland as well. I got the mild and it was definitely a bit overwhelming with the numbing effects and spicy. I thought I wouldn't be able to finish my order at one point, but I am a newb when it comes to spicy foods . Although the numbing/spicy flavor was there, it lacked actual seasoning to the broth and noodles, a bit bland. The noodles were great though as it had a great chew texture to it. As Chinese people would say, (literal translation) bounce teeth. My spare ribs were dry and a bit bland as well, my veggies were not cooked. They looked like raw wilting veggies. It would have been decent if it was at least cooked thoroughly. Very disappointed in that since I LOVE VEGGIES! Service was a bit slow granted they did have 5 other seated parties. My friend had gone the night before and said service was fine and his spare rib noodles were good. Maybe they don't do that well when it's busier? I do like the option to add 100g of noodles free of charge, my boyfriend took advantage of that as he was hungry.  We also ordered the chili oil dumplings, comes in 12 pieces. Pretty spicy and large in size, only $8.99 which is a good price compared to other places that sell dumplings. Eat it while it's hot, not as good cold. We wanted to try the mung bean soup, but they were sold out. Will come back to try another dish, hopefully it would be better and we just happened to try them out on their off day.",

Asian restaurants that offer legit chopsticks instead of the shit wood ones xD.  The pricing, the service, the quaint environment are all welcoming for people who are novel to or even well acquainted with Szechuan cuisine.      Most times I've gone to other Szechuan places, the crowds have been predominantly exclusive snotty Chinese, or annoying Caucasian Business types from like Wolf of Wall Street.  I dont care about people's ethnic backgrounds, it's just sometimes irksome when you have a particular set of folk dominating the restaurant vibe who always ruin my dining.  Over here I often see different ethnic groups, ages, demographics, and really chill Chinese instead of rude exclusive types.  I like it here.  I dislike exclusion, like all humans enjoy food dont be a dick.      The spice level here is nice for me because I'm addicted to spice.  They even have this neutralizer type tea.  This mung bean sugar soup.  It sounds weird but its quite delicious and helps a lot with that spice overload and boogers.  The Szechuan, Sichuan, Cold Noodles are my favorite.  The soupy noodles with egg, without the egg is bomb too.  Also, black fungus all the way.  I'll review more thoroughly after a few more visits.  The food here is great and I will often visit the place",

The beef was braised until it is melt in your mouth tender. The noodles had good flavor and texture. These are about the thickness of regular size spaghetti.   They serve complimentary mung bean drink and a pickled cabbage appetizer. I loved the cabbage, crunchy, slightly sour and slightly sweet.

At 12pm, they tell you they no longer have any mung bean soup when that's what actually made me want to eat here. No side dish was served unlike the 1 at LA Rowland Heights Brunch. I had the intestine mala noodles and the soup tasted watered down. Service was lackluster and the place doesn't seem as clean as the 1 at Rowland Heights. The saving grace was the noodle texture but I'm really not sure if I will return again since there are many better options around here in Vegas.   It's even more disappointing to know that the branch at Rowland Heights and Vegas have the same owner. Definitely not the best way to end our Vegas trip.",

    "text": "Mian joins one busy Spring Mountain plaza with some Szechuan dishes that will leave you sweating!   I've been watching a lot of strictly dumpling on YouTube and tried this place out with my buddy. I've never had Szechuan peppercorns and it is truly a unique heat.  They specialize in numbingly spicy dishes that you eat with a cool tea for balance. The staff literally walk around refilling mugs for the patrons. On the menu they have hot or cold dishes, dumpling or noodle dishes, and meat or vegetarian dishes. They also have appetizers that are pretty unique: my favorite being their steamed egg served in a mug with spicy ground meat.  Each main dish comes a certain way but they have add ins like extra meats or a fried egg. I opted for their chef recommended beef noodle soup. I added short ribs and intestines. These add ins are a couple bucks and served in a separate bowl of broth that they're cooked in I'm assuming. I don't recommend dumping these into your main dish as it alters the flavor.   The hot soup with the spicy peppercorns will get you sweating even if it's cold out. The tea they serve is unique and I do recommend getting a lot of refills.   Overall I thought this place was okay. They have terrible service. I don't think they should do sit down style ordering because they don't come by to take your order. I had to go up to the register after being their for 15 minutes to order. I advised the couple next to me to do the same after I heard them getting impatient. We also had to go up to pay. They have a lot of potential with their location if the staff would just leave the register and take some orders and refill drinks.  The food itself was okay. They dish I got was good but nothing cravable. Also the meats I ordered were cooked well but served less than luke warm and not too flavorful. The heat from the peppercorn was definitely an experience but the overall flavor was a miss. If anything their egg appetizer and mushroom appetizer were things I'd get again. With so many other Szechuan restaurants in the area I'd not come back here anytime soon.",

She was also not very attentive. We literally watched her serve the table across from us with a giant smile and come over looking like we just asked for a refund.   If you can only slightly handle spice, please go for their non-spicy noodles. This place is True to the cuisine. My parents who can't stop talking about the amazing noodles they had while in Chongqing thought it was amazing.  The heat here is so intense. But to those who love spicy, you will love it. They serve a sweet green bean tea to help with the spice bother on the tongue and internally. If you're Chinese, you know I mean it's cooling!!  Restrooms we're very clean!! Is it a Vegas thing?  I will definitely be back when I'm in Vegas again. Hopefully service will be better.",

    "text": "I was craving noodles and this spot popped up under Hot n New so I decided to check this place out with a couple of friends. I know that Szechuan restaurants tend to mainly have spicy dishes, so I enjoyed the fact that u can order mild to medium spicy level here.  They start out by giving everyone this drink which is Mung Bean Soup. According to the menu, when you eat something really spicy....this drink will help tame your taste buds....it really works and is refreshing (better than water, and Ill tell you why later).  Our table ordered Spicy Black Fungus- great appitizer/side dish. Spicy Radish- too hard, difficult to chew. Chengdu Zajiang Noodles- dry noodles with egg and minced pork Intestine Noodle Soup-different kinda flavor goin on here. Steamed Egg with minced pork on side- delish and good amount for price. Hot and Sour ChaoShou- broth was soo good! Side of Spare Ribs- ehh plain. As you know szechuan dishes are packed with flavor and spices and a little oily. As I am eating....Im thinking to myself my tongue feels weird. I told my friends that my tongue feels weird...maybe its oily.....oh wait it feels numb. For a second I thought I was allergic to something, but then my other friend said he felt the same thing hahahahah. I drank some water but that tasted weird as hell. I was like....why does the water taste funny. My other friend said their water tasted bomb. Then my other friend told me that sometimes szechuan food sometimes makes your tongue feel numb from all the spices. OHHH makes sense now! Here is when the Mung Bean Soup comes into play. I kept drinking that and it tasted pretty good to me since my taste buds were all outta wack. It tasted better than water! So thats my experience here. I dont know if I would purposely come back, but Im glad I got to try this place out. Staff is friendly, food comes out quick after ordering. Its located next to Tea Station. Parking can be difficult to find esp for dinner time or weekends.",

Flavors are endearing especially their dumplings that was well balanced with sweet and salty taste. Their  nice settings of bowls  are large enough to fill you up, it's  originality speaks for it's cold but authentic  mung bean soup which, is unlimited in it's very cute white tin mug.  I enjoyed it's lightness in texture just like tea but the beans remain in the bottom unless you mix it to taste a little sweetness. I like their paper placemats with pictures and witty slogans as well.  This place is simple but has it's own character.  Fast service, friendly staff and the price is right.  Last but not the least,  it is immaculate clean.  Cons:  They did not have any single bottled  spice on any of the tables as Asian soup places do.  It would be ideally good to have just in case people want more heat or salt in their soups.  However, i never asked.    Lesson:  Ask and you shall receive.  Maybe??  All in all, i really enjoyed my visit here.  Check it out if you are in the area.  It will not disappoint.",

The price is very fair and the service was good. We came in for lunch and it was very busy. People waiting at the door.  The only disappointment was that they were out of Mung Bean soup which is supposed to accompany the hot spicy noodles. Seems like an item they should never run out of. Especially since it's featured so prominently on the place mats.  We will definitely return here. Hopefully they will have the Mung Bean soup : ). I would recommend this place if you have the craving for some hot, spicy noodles",

    "text": "Are you ready for that spicy, tingly, feeling on your lips and taste buds? Time for some authentic Sichuan (or Szechuan) cuisine! Here at Mian you're first served some mung bean soup as a drink to help cool your tongue as you prepare for your spicy dish. It's a subtly sweet, refreshing beverage w/ small mung beans (think similarly to boba).  Their menu is 90% spicy dishes, so if you're not into spicy food, this may not be the place for you. I ordered the House Beef Noodle Soup ($9.99). Don't forget to read their placemat on how to eat their dishes - it'll give you the best experience when grubbing down. The noodles were nice and firm, al dente, and the broth was spicy and had those special Sichuan peppers that made your lips and tongue tingle. I couldn't help but smile and feel the endorphins from the capsaicin rush. However, their beef was overcooked and tough to chew on. It took away from the experience and I preferred not to eat it, even though I did because I don't like wasting food.  I'd definitely come back here and try their other dishes. It's another great place for a culinary adventure.  Tips:  * If you easily get heartburn or flaming hot @$$, don't eat here. It's mostly spicy food.  * If you don't want to eat spicy food, they do have 2 bone broth dishes.  * When eating any spicy noodle soup, make sure to stir the noodles all the way to the bottom of the bowl when serving yourself each time. It ensures absorption and capturing of the Sichuan peppers in between the noodles for each bite.  * Remember you're in Chinatown. You're not gonna get Guy Savoy service here.",

The place was very nice and clean, bright lights, I like that the tables are sectioned off which gives you a little privacy.   I really liked the mungbean \"soup\" that they served instead of water, it supposedly helps cool your body. The soup was served cold, not too sweet, very refreshing.   My sister wanted to try the intestine noodle which they said were sold out, then she wanted the short rib noodle which was also sold out. So she decided on beef noodle which she really enjoyed. Said noodle was chewy and tasted fresh, broth was flavorful. I was not in the mood for spicy food so I got the wontons which I really liked. The soup was plain, not bland, plain...which tasted very healthy, perfect for late meal. The wontons were flavorful so I thought the overall dish was great, the plain broth complimented the flavorful wonton. I would definitely come back for more and to try other dishes.   Cons: - They did not have the two dishes that my sister came to try (I personally feel that when you are new you want to be on point and have your most interesting items in stock all the time so everyone who comes in can try your best items) - The menu was wrong all over the place, they have the same description for different dishes which is misleading when it is your first time there and is trying to know the menu - Service was also not the best, I did not come here expecting excellent service but we waited a long time and had to flag someone down to get the check  Overall, really good food, service needs improvement. Maybe you should come early if you want to try their popular items.",

Have I, in anywhere, complained about the waiting time!?!?! I, in fact, give my understanding toward the long waiting period during peak hours. my points are all toward the bad service the waitresses provide! The attitudes they have in themselves while serving customers creates an unprofessional and rude image to us. I believe it's not the owner's intent to make customers feel like what i described, but what i described happened. And,The fact that the owner did not pick up this obvious points i described on the previous review makes me doubts what they really \"intent to serve\".   As a loyal Mian customer in LA, i am still very disappointed about this one in Vegas.",

Great noodle soups, and unusual and delicious sides: black fungus, steamed greens, spicy beef, pickled cabbage with unique spicing.   If you're not a big fan of noodles (like my sweetie), there aren't a lot of options for you here. If you are, check it out.",

We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and we ordered the following: 1. egg custard and minced pork - must eat the custard with the minced pork for a balanced flavor.  We ordered a side order of plain noodles and mixed this appetizer with the noodles for our toddler and she loved it.   2. noodle soup with intestine - the noodle was al dente, the soup was numbingly spicy and flavorful, and the intestine was tender.  I would order this again. 3. dry noodle with minced pork and fried egg - was spicy but quite delicious as well. 4. side of radish - spicy and good to have with the dry noodle.  The cold mung bean soup was a lifesaver..as you can see above, majority of the dishes are made with the Sichuan pepper, that spicy that tingles your tongue.  I am surprised as how much flavor is in the food since one would think the spiciness would overwhelm the dish...but NOPE!  I had the rest of my noodle soup with intestine tonight and here I am, writing this review, and already planning on lunching here with my team tomorrow.",

I could of been a returning customer but the service was such a turn off.   My brother came in with me but decided he wasn't going to eat. So they took away his complimentary tea but left the vegetable thing. I mean once you place it on the table, do you just take it away? Doesn't seem inviting. The attention to customers were kind of poor as well. I find it unsettling when the staff is laughing louder than the customers are even making noise. Do I even have to ask for water if I'm ordering Spicy beef noodle soup. I mean cmon get it together. And there was no thank you or come again. If I come back, I'm returning strictly for the food with low expectations for service.",

    "text": "Surprise, surprise! Most authentic spicy sour noodle i have ever had in the States, and it is 10 mins from the Strip in Vegas!   Came in here during a biz trip. Was fed up with all the Vegas froufrou, fine wine and steak (not exactly complaining but i need something refreshing :).Looked up Chinese food around the Strip and found Mian.   $10 Uber ride later, I was here.   Mian, literally means \"rice noodle\" in Chinese. And that's all you would find on the menu, besides few appetizers.   I was skeptical: coming from NYC, I was pretty confident we got the best Chinese food in the States (on average, this is still True). But the moment I saw that red, hot, big bowl of spicy sour noodle, in my face! My doubt gone out the window :) . It was just like what I remembered back in the street of Chengdu. Thin rice noodle, slightly toothsome, floating in ping ping hot sweet sour soup decorated with green onion, fried eggs, fried soybeans and pickled green beens. Hit the spot!  I was hungry so I also ordered woodears mushrooms, cold chili beef and a beef stew noodle to go. Def overkilled. But hey, we are in Vegas ;P . everything was delicious and traditional Sichuan cooking. The beef stew was seasoned in five spice and cooked prob hours before serving - was savory sweet and melt-in-your-mouth tender!  I also spotted other less know items  such as bone broth noodle, which aptly called \"milk soup noodle\" due to its silky, milky texture and color.   Def will come back next time I am in Vegas and highly recommend!  PS. I could give 5 star but i think the spicy sour noodle could tone down on the salt and up the heat :) But that just me.",

    "text": "This was my first time trying Sichuan food, so I don't have anything to compare it to. I think a lot of people are going to try to compare these noodles to ramen, but these dishes have some distinct qualities I've never experienced before.   We came in on a Friday night and there were only 2-3 other tables occupied. The clientele is mostly all Chinese so you know they're doing something right. As soon as we were seated the waitress brought us mung bean soup and pickled vegetables. The mung bean soup is used to cool off your mouth after eating the spicy foods. It tastes like iced tea but has beans in the bottom of it that sort of resemble split pea soup. It does work to cool you off so use it. No one is drinking water here.   To start we ordered the steamed egg with minced pork which is seriously amazing. The pork is oily and savory while the egg is light and creamy. Definitely suggest getting this dish. After that we both ordered the house beef noodle. The dish itself is just gorgeous: a mix of white noodles, green vegetables and red soup.The noodles are less springy than ramen noodles, but taste fresh and almost floury. It filled me up a lot quicker because they were more dense. The broth is light but intense with flavor and heat. We usually go for super spicy ramen but we did a \"regular spicy\" here and I'm glad we did. The thing that I was not expecting was the tingling that happens in your whole mouth after eating the food. It's not like your mouth becomes numb from the heat, it's that the Sichuan peppers actually cause a tingling sensation. Drink mung bean soup to alleviate some of the tingling. The meat in the dish was very tender but a little fatty at times. I think this is a great intro dish. Next time I'd love to try some of the noodle dishes without soup. Overall I'm glad we tried Mian out. It's always exciting having new food experiences like this and I recommend to anyone who likes ramen and wants something more adventurous.",

I was told that their spicy here was really spicy so I opted for medium heat. I was disappointed that my order was taken wrong and when my noodles came out I could taste no heat at all. So I asked for a side of the chili and peppers and added a good amount to my dish. The flavors were way better with the spice. Since the noodles were not cooked with the spices it was not as spicy as it should have been.   We weren't given the option to have the mung bean soup, but then again we didn't ask for it. I'm not sure if it automatically comes with your meal or it is available upon request. I still enjoyed my meal even though it was wrong. I am looking forward to having this place again and my dish be made correctly lol.",

The noodles are also very good, and they will give you extra noodles for just about any dish free of charge. To top it all off, they serve a wonderful mung bean soup as a beverage that cools the tongue from the intense Sizchuan spice. Trust me though, I'm no slouch when it comes to spice, but the \"less spicy\" option was still VERY powerful (almost left my mouth numb). Only opt for the True spicy options if you are are a Sizchuan native or a literal masochist.  If all that wasn't praise enough, their wait staff is great. Truly nice people, even brought our table a free dessert just because he \"liked my mom\". 5 out of 5 stars, could not recommend more for lovers of spicy food.",

I thought we'd give it a try since it had such good reviews.   I wasn't sure what to expect cause it wasn't exactly Ramen or anything else I was familiar with. Sometimes you have to just take a chance.   So we ordered the beef soup, short rib soup, intestine soup and the cold noodles. Sounded pretty straight forward to me but It wasn't. Not in a bad way. Just different from what you might be used to.  It's hard to describe but interestingly different.  I requested for my soup to be extra spicy. He tried to warn me but I did it anyway. Usually places don't make it spicy enough. Not here! I think one of the ingredients was lava! Good but Damn hot! So beware when ordering HOT.  The interesting thing is that after my mouth being on fire, I took a sip of tea that they served on the table. Strangest thing is that  the heat INSTANTLY went away! What? I've never experienced that. I mean, Instantly!   If you've never eaten here, be open minded and willing to try something different. After all, variety is the spice of life. Enjoy!",

I like how casual and simple the picture menu is, and I recently found out Mian has the same owner from Chengdu Taste.  All noodles are good if you have a spice palate, and make sure to get my favorite appetizer \"steamed egg with minced pork\" a staple dish that reminds me of my grandmothers kitchen.",

The staff are nice, give you extra napkins, and bring you unlimited lightly sweetened mung bean tea. The menu offers different items ranging from appetizers to soups and dry noodles. They also give you the option of choosing your spice level from mild to authentic spicy! The prices aren't bad for the amount of food that you get~  My bf and I ordered the steamed egg, spicy dumplings, house beef noodle soup, and Schezuan spicy cold noodles. The egg was fluffy and had little pieces of pork bits in it, a light mild taste perfect before eating spicy food. The meaty dumplings were covered in chewy long wrappers and were drenched in a soy sauce base and Schezuan peppercorns. The soup came with crunchy bok choy and tender beef that was still cooking in the hot broth. My favorite was the cold noodles- which were chewy and matched well with the taste of the mung bean tea. Complimentary pickled sour spicy cabbage comes in a small side dish as well. Overall I highly recommend going to Mian due to their high quality food at a decent price! This is a restaurant I will keep coming back to.",

They have non spicy options for those who don't enjoy spicy food, but the real authentic ones are the spicy ones (Chengdu is part of Sichuan where the regional food there tends to thrive on spiciness). Overall the food is 5/5 for me.  Oh yes and the mung bean soup served free for everyone who dines in. It is more of a traditional Chinese drink. I believe you can request ice to be added to it to make it more refreshing.  Customer Service: 5/5 fast and attentive service. Never had to flag anyone down.   Ambience: 5/5 cozy little restaurant, though parking can be difficult  at times as it shares the lot with many other businesses, but I never had a problem finding one.",

Also, we fed two people for less than a single persons entry at the Wynn buffet.   We ordered the zajiang noodle with peas, cold noodles, radish, and steamed egg with pork. Every single dish was perfect. I'll definitely come back.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch on Monday after running around for smog check and hair cut (which both didn't happen btw because smog check had 3 cars ahead and my hair stylist was out of town till Tuesday)  Incidentally i was in the main Chinatown plaza (for the haircut) and decided to come here for lunch. I got lucky and found parking like right in front of the restaurant (everyone knows parking sucks in this complex). After i went into the restaurant, all the side tables were occupied. The waiter asked if I would be willing to sit in the big table in the middle with others, and i was fine with that.   Fastest lunch ever. I was in and out of the restaurant in like 15 - 20 minutes. This was about 0100PM on a Monday afternoon. I was sat at my seat, given the menu, gave my order of the Piquant Intestine Noodle with extra noodle, got my food, ate, and gone.   Like the menu picture shows, the Piquant Intestine Noodle gives you some bak choy, piquant intestine, and noodles. Very simple but flavorful noodle soup. Not sure what piquant intestine means but from my experience in eating intestines, it was like, mini large intestines. I had wished they had used normal sized large intestines as they are much \"meatier\". The soup base at a \"normal spiciness\" is pretty decent. Had a good amount of \"ma\" and \"la\" which is the numb and spicy aspects of chongqing/sichuan cuisine but was not overpowering so i was able to eat my noodles fast. Price wise, it was great. I think my bowl of noodles were $8.99. With a free 100g side of extra noodles, it was a good amount of food for my hungry self, since i haven't really ate since 0630AM that morning. Not sure if it was because i was able to eat much faster than i did last time (not status post night of drinking and dehydration), the noodles didn't really soak up the soup as much as it did last time.   Service was quick. Unfortunately they didn't refill my cup of mung bean soup. Since the \"visit\" was so fast, it didn't really bother me too much.   Would like to come back to try other noodles like the spare rib noodles, special gizzard noodles.",

    "text": "\"You guys order for me.  I don't know Asiany stuff\" says Midwest poker bud.  Five minutes later, piquant pig intestine noodles with gizzard.  \"Awww come on!\"  in total evaporation.  Just in time for the falling temperatures comes the sister restaurant of Chengdu Taste serving one thing; zhajiangmian-style noodles.  A spicy noodle soup with a complex beef broth set on fire with the addition of chilies and tongue numbing Sichuan peppercorns.  The spice of the food is not taste bud blowing but rather coats the whole mouth.  You feel the heat but you are still able to taste the goodness of the ingredients as you eat.  That said, you will still sweat.  The menu is simple and offers variants of the same noodle dish in either a standard spicy broth or a hot and sour broth.  Although there is a primary protein, diners can order extra ingredients including all proteins offered in different soups and free additional noodles.  Noodles are well cooked, still maintaining their chew.  They do absorb the soup rapidly so eat quickly.  The broth itself, very spicy but brings out the sweetness of the beef (beef noodle soup) and the richness of the intestine (piquant intestine noodles).  The mineral taste of the gizzard blends pleasantly with the soup the way a blood cake would work in other Asian noodle dishes.  The only issue, the braised beef could have been cooked longer.   Slightly tough but still flavorful.  The chili oil chaoshou (steamed dumplings) are good with the chili oil bringing out the sweetness of the pork dumpling.    Finally, do follow their recommendation and drink the free, cooling mung bean \"soup\".  Slightly sweet, it kills the burn better than water.  Asian service.  You get your food and if you need anything, wave your arms in the air and flag someone down.  Inexpensive.   Less than $10/bowl.  New eatery well worth the visit (if you can handle the spice).",

I especially loved the dry noodles with gizzard! That was listed a \"chef's pick\" so gave it a try and liked it. I would go back just for it bc it was that good. I wasn't too fond of the hot and sour dumplings - it made the meat taste old. Next time, i have to stick to the original spicy dumplings in red oil. Inside you'll notice only Chinese people so you know it's authentic and meets True Sichuan standards.",

You can even choose the spiciness level for the noodles and we ordered a medium which was pretty spicy. The mung bean soup was a life saver. The food was really really good, especially if you are craving good,  numbing, spicy noodles. Portions are pretty decent as well. Will definitely come back and recommend to others.",

I came here hungry with a few friends and we all tried different dishes. I ordered the house beef noodle soup regular spice and it was great! There was just enough spice in it but not an overpowering amount. They gave us generous amounts of meats and noodles for the price ($9.99). We also tried to dry noodle and spare rib noodle soup. Their spare rib noodle soup was alright for me. I'd definitely recommend the House Beef Noodle though. They also give you a cup of cold sweet soup that is free and refillable! It tastes better once you have the actual food, it was kind of weird without the food. Definitely helps you calm your numb tongue!",

Plenty of spicy oil and ground pork to coat the noodles. Bits of baby bok choy and an egg that's been fried crispy. The combination works so well and is down right addictive.  Also had the red oil wontons. The pork fillings were good.  The wrappers seemed a bit fragile for this dish. Overall good but not as good as the Zhajiangmian.   Got the wood year mushrooms to complement. They were refreshing to balance the spicy dishes and had these small chilis that I enjoyed. They serve this green bean cold drink that lowers the hot pretty well.",

I got the pork rib noodle while my husband got the house beef noodle soup. The beef was tender and flavorful, the broth was just okay. The noodles and broth for my pork dish was amazing, but the pork was dried and barely had any meat on it.  Our friend got one of the dumpling meals which was really good. It was flavorful but not too strong.  The only main complaint I have would be the appetizers. The appetizers were not good at all. We got the marinated pork and steam vegetables. The vegetables were dry and looked like it was microwaved. Good thing we got the steam vegetables for free by liking their yelp page. We each had a piece of the pork and couldn't even finish chewing it. All in all this place is decent, but nothing I would crave.",

    "text": "So once again, the girlfriend requested that we'd go to another authentic Sichuan place. She really likes her spicy food. As usual, it didn't disappoint (She wanted me to add that she knows her stuff, please follow Gabby S. for great check-ins)   There's definitely a wait for this place, however they don't seem to take reservations as there's a write-in wait list. We waited for like 20-30 minutes on a Wednesday night. We checked out Tea Station, which was right next to it, so that's a good spot to linger around while waiting. They're a bit rude, but the tea is good so not a big deal. Be sure to get the milk tea, with the matcha cream puff topping. It's an extra 50 cents, but it's worth it.   Once we got in though, service was courteous and quick. They provide you some Mung bean juice on the house (which is really good by the way, although its not as sweet as other places we've been too). Menu's also pretty easy to look at. My girlfriend got the Suan La Mian (which is a spicy & sour noodle broth), and I got the pork intestine noodle soup. Both are very delicious.   Prices are reasonable (Noodle soups are only 8.99 a piece, appetizers 1.99 - 4.99). I would say though, if you're hungry, definitely order extra meat / veggies, they do kind of skimp on the extras (besides noodles).",

Inside the place is casual and clean. I wanted to sit on a booth but they don't have booths, not a big deal.  I like the menu, it is beautiful and there is instructions on the placemat on how to eat.  You get a complimentary Mung bean sugar drink/soup. It's a cold drink and when asked it was made of natural mung beans, water, and sugar. This helps with the spicyness. It's also refillable. In addition, it was accompanied by a side dish of pickled cabbage which was ok. I learned they are all mostly handmade noodle and I asked for medium spicy.  I had the Chengdu ZaJiang Noodles $8.99 and my dad had the Hot and sour noodles $7.99. The spicyness level was on point. The ingredients were rich, and the broth flavorful.  The service was soso, we weren't asked if everything was good but we did get refill on the drink. Price was very reasonable.",

The Mung Bean soup drink is a life saver if you're not all that into spicy foods. The Mung Bean soup drink helps with the spice bites in between. For people who don't like spice, I'd definitely recommend getting a mild as the spice flavor builds up. I got a medium spice however, I felt that the spice was more of a numbing but bearable spice. All my girlfriends ordered the house beef noodle and we also ordered chili oil pork wontons with extra bok choy. Overall, will be eating this again after I come back to Cali as there are two locations in the 626 area!",

The potsticker skin was not delicate, the vegetables were steamed and completely unseasoned. Perhaps this is the style of authentic Sichuan food but the noodle soups were all disappointing. I preferred the broth of the spare rib and the meat in the beef noodle soup (less dry). Soups overall were pretty bland and tasted of pure spice.

    "text": "The food here is tasty, but like most Chinese restaurants, you should not be expecting stellar friendly service.  We ordered the top 3 recommended items & more: - spicy sparerib noodle soup w/ a side of intestines: the intestines were very lackluster (overcooked and lacking any chewiness) but the the noodles soaked in the chili oil-laden broth was amazing. The spareribs are tasty and bok choy was delightful. - chengdu zajiang noodles: spicy minced pork with tasty noodles. you are more likely to win betting on this than at whatever smoky casino you're staying in. This bowl was frickin tasty. - steamed egg w/ minced pork: DO IT. - spicy radish: do it. you will never find that mix of spicy crunchy goodness anywhere else. - pork dumplings: frickin amazing. pretty sure they hide some crack in the sauce because we wanted to drench everything else with it - mung bean drink: this def helps with the spiciness so swish it in your mouth a little and continue taking the pounding from the chili.  Did you know that spicy food trigger a rush of endorphins? As others have said, this is not \"white people spicy\" and the white people I brought were sufficiently spiced but happy. So happy that we ordered more to go for midnight snack.  \"If you're so happy, then why only 4 stars?\" Well, one of 5 in the party was missing his bowl of noodles 10 minutes after everyone else got their food. Rather than admitting that she didn't put in the order, the waitress shrugged it off and said it was still cooking buuuuuuuuuuuuut we already got 1 of the 2 same items we ordered. Small mistakes like these are understandable, but just own up to it, will ya? Also be sure to check your bill since the waitress doesn't remember who ordered what and messed up the bill.  This spot is well worth the short ride off the strip. Your tongue will be sufficiently numb from the Sichuan peppercorns. Take a brisk 6 minute-walk (thanks, G-map) over to Meet Fresh to calm your taste buds-- you will not regret it :)",

The spicy cabbage given as a complimentary appetizer has a nice, tart kick and is much better than the one offered in the SGV locations. The complimentary mung bean soup (cold) pairs perfectly with the heavier noodles. The steamed egg appetizer was simple & flavorful. I expected for it to be very salty but it wasn't overwhelming. 5/5 recommend",

It was all explained on the placemat, which adds a cute touch to everything. As for the main dishes, it was okay, nothing had stood out to me, but it was not bad. Soup noodles were more on the bland side in my opinion. Unfortunately, since it has been a while back, I don't recall what I had ordered sorry! :(",

Last night, when I was ordering the food, the waiter walked away even before I finished my sentence, and the restaurant was not even busy at that point. And there was no water. I asked a waitress if I could have some water. She looked at me, did even say anything, and then walked away. But she did bring me the water.  After I finished I waited for a few minutes and made eye contact with some waiters as a hint for a check, but all of them just stood there and continued chatting, instead of giving me a check. Eventually I had to get it by myself.  This is not a pleasant experience at all.",

We got there before they open in ten minutes, we waited in car until they open and look at menu from the yelp app. Within minutes the sign was flip to open and doors were unlocked, we headed in to be seated. At first, I thought it was nice and since my friend suggested about this place, why not give it a try.   Overlooking the menu, I decided to get the house beef noodles soup and cold noodles(I don't remember the name exactly but it was cold and spicy). They also served mung bean soup (which is similar to the Vietnamese che do san) everything was great, the place paper has drawing and side notes on how to eat the noodles. Until my friend pointed out on their whiteboard about getting a free appetizer if you follow and comment on their yelp page. Which I already done checking in but thought it was nice of them to offer free appetizer, so here we are looking at the menu under the section; trying to figure which ones until the server came by and we asked him about it. He pointed out these small black dish in the middle of our table. Not sure if it's picked cabbage or vinegar. Our faces were blank and just arched our brow. Okay??   We just order our food, my order was house beef noodles and cold noodles. It was good. Spicy and the broth was flavorful. Will I ever go back??? I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. They do have one in Los Angeles so I might go try them out and see. But about the appetizer, I think they need to be a more specific on it so guests don't get confuse.",

It's not the same thing. Both our orders are good to taste except the beef is a little dry. Other than that the noodle is very nice and just the right chewyness. I will definitely come back to try more other types of dishes.",

    "text": "One of my friends told me about Mian Sichuan Noodles. It was brand spanking new and how could I resist trying out a new spot? A NOODLE spot at that! I love some good noodles!  Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with my fiance and my best friend. We were lucky enough to find a spot the moment we got to the plaza and were seated right away.   My fiance went with their spicy beef noodles. My best friend went with their hot and sour noodles. As for me, I went with their spicy pig intestine noodles. For every bowl of noodles, you have the option of adding extra items to it such as an egg, more meat, etc. Extra noodles are free of charge so if you're a big eater or you just want a giant serving, go ahead and get a serving of free noodles! All the extras that you get on the side literally comes on the side. They don't put it in your bowl of noodles. They serve it to you in an individual bowl unless you get a fried egg. If you get extra noodles, extra beef, side of something else .. you will have a total of four bowls.   My bowl of noodles definitely had a good amount of kick. It was spicy but it's a different kind of spicy than most people are used to. They use the numbing spice. This type of spicy is quite famous in the Sichuan region. In Chinese, we refer it to \"mala\" which is pretty much translated to \"numbing spicy\" .. the herbs that they use will numb your tongue. It's a completely different feeling from having ghost pepper. So if you like this type of spicy then go for it. If you don't then don't get it because you won't like it.   Other than the numbing spice, the bowl of noodles was definitely a burst of flavor. My bowl was actually a different base than my fiance's. His had less spice and more of a beefy flavor. I also enjoyed the pig intestines quite a bit. They were flavorful and fatty.   They also give you a decent amount of noodles in your bowl. I actually didn't finish my bowl of noodles because I got so full.   You also get a green bean/mung bean drink with your meal. It is slightly sweet and refreshing. The servers come around asking if you want a refill on that too, which is nice. You might have to tell them to speak English though.   So why three stars? The location of this establishment is horrid. I hate the plaza that it's in. It gets really busy there due to Tea Station and Ichiza so finding parking can be a nightmare, especially during dinner time. Honestly, I don't think I would come again if I had to deal with that nightmare. I would probably only come in random odd hours where the parking won't be annoyingly stupid.   The service, as someone else has mentioned, is quite lackluster. There will be times where they're constantly walking around and making sure you're okay but then there are times where none of them are there. Making eye contact is especially hard because it seems they're trying to avoid you. When you say \"excuse me\" you have to say it loud or they ignore you. I got ignored twice. Despite that, they are all very polite and nice.   Overall, it is decent. It's just not the type of spicy flavors that I prefer. I don't like the numbing effect of the spice. I wouldn't mind trying it again though.",

Most Chinese restaurants here in Las Vegas caters more to an American palate. And of the authentic Chinese restaurants, most are just \"meh.\"   And that's why i was so excited when I saw Mian while driving down Spring Mountain, and I was not disappointed when I finally went. The noodles were delicious AND very spicy...as Sichuan-style Chinese food should be.  The service was also fast and attentive...an unusual quality for an authentic Chinese restaurant in Chinatown ;)   I also love the ambiance of the restaurant...very trendy. Mian somehow made a very boring, traditional type of Chinese food feel \"cool.\" The ambiance of the restaurant makes you want stay awhile after you finish eating to hang out with your friends and chat.  But yea, great restaurant. Definitely would come back. A must go-to place whenever you have friends from Taiwan or China visit.",

My biggest gripe with it was that they failed to realize they were out of one of the dishes my friend ordered so everybody else's food came out and it wasn't until then they informed him. Another friend in my group has a wheat allergy so he asked if it was possible to have his order with just broth and no noodles, but unfortunately, they could not accommodate him. Also, bring cash if coming in a group, they don't really split checks.  Despite this, I really enjoyed the food. I don't recall the name of the dish I ordered, but it was spicy and did not have broth. The flavour was really delicious, although I could have used a little more spice. (Not the restaurant's fault, just a personal preference.) The noodles had a really nice consistency and there was a nice amount of meat and sauce. I would definitely return with friends who are into spicy food.",

Just another reason for me to return ;-).   All of the dishes were scrumptious! Although I am a bit of a wuss when it comes to spicy food (I really wish I wasn't!), I can still take some heat, and the mild spice level of the Spare Ribs Noodles was just right for me.

Got the free drink called mun beans soup. Ordered rib noodles which they stated ran out since last night and won't be available til 2 hrs from now the earliest. We ended up getting beef, intestines noodles along with the dumplings and fungus dish Their hot spice was different. Can't really feel the hot from spice but you can feel you get hot from inside out and it make my nose runs . I also notice my mouth feel slightly numbed after drinking the cold munbeans drink Noodle soft chewy, meat & intestines was tender, dumplings dish sweet and spicy , need to share the dumplings since the sauce soak in chili oil , more sweet then spicy and I feel it would be sickening for one person trying to eat all that dumplings by self",

    "text": "I would give this place 2.5 stars because its not terrible but it doesn't deserve 3 and the business shows. Their business model is really cute and very well presented and there is no reason why the place shouldn't be slammed like Monta Ramen or Jinya.  The biggest problem is its service, I've read this is several yelp reviews. Their staff is poorly trained.  It usually one 1 person per shift who truly cares, refills your mug, checks up on you and notices your hand up trying to hail for service.  The rest usually stand around like statues trying to do less work.  Today when I got the check, I put my card on the tray and left it at the corner of my table.  The fat guy passed us three times and did nothing,  the skinny guy finally noticed it.  LOL I made eye contact every time just too see how much they care.  Then it came back without a pen from the fat guy.  It just goes to show thier training.  I don't get mad, I think its laughable.  I've been back to the place about 5 times now and I come because the prices are good and you get free extra noodle.  However I have to warn you, the food is not for everyone.  Pretty much everything here is spicy and mouth numbing.  Yes I said mouth numbing.  They put ingredients in their noodles that has a local anesthesia effect.   My mom is from Szechuan so I am used to it but not really either cuz they over do it.    The food is good but its TOO spicy and too much of the numbing agent.  I can't really taste my food after the 5th bite.  I'm sure management will argue that flavor is subjective and spice level depends on the user.  I disagree.  Here in America we have real culinary schools and not just family hand down recipe kitchens, and they will tell you there is absolutely something called, too much heat, too much garlic, too much seasoning.  So compared to like spicy tuna rolls, spicy ramen bowls, some Kimchi, Or even a bag of hot cheetos.  This place is really spicy.  You might argue that it's authentic but that doesn't mean its not too spicy for Las Vegas and hence the business they get.  The free mung bean soup beverage to me.  I love it,  but I gotta say most people don't drink it.  It looks like a cup of muddy water, and it is but it's good for you.  What I find hilarious is that the mug says soup on it in Chinese and translation soup!.  LOL  I laugh because you have to be Chinese to understand that we have a lot things \"called soup\" that's actually just a beverage.  What I found hysterical was that one day while sitting at the big center shared table, a couple across from us who was actually from Cheng Du  took one look at the mung Bean soup and passed on it.  Then After I asked for a refill in of it in Chinese,  They overheard me and said,  OH! that's what this is? and started drinking it like normal Chinese folks.  ROFL  So Although I give it a bad rating,  I personally like this place, but it needs a ton of tweaks, because although the star rating is high, this business here is not that good for these reasons.  #1 Poor Service #2 Too spicy #3 TOO MUCH NUMBING AGENT!  no one eats that stuff except for Szechuan people.  but I'm positive they want to Americanize the business for more sales or why bother making all those English cartoons. #4 I love the mung bean soup but its gotta go,  most people are grossed out by it.  So would I recommend this place?  Yes, but only if you're into the weird because the numbing agent helps you NOT taste your food. But that's what Szechuan is!  LOL!",

    "text": "Ok, so a Tiger or Zebra may not be able to change their stripes, but I can change my Stars (or lack thereof).   After 3 failed attempts, I decided to pay a \"surprise\" visit since they are (sort of) on the way home from work.  Got in on a Monday around 6:15pm, and thank goodness for my timing because by 7:00pm as I write this, all 7 exterior tables, and the big middle table are occupied (can't see if the back tables are)!  Bay Area folks will recall Vien Huong on 7th and Franklin in Oakland and their signature Chinese/Vietnamese Noodle Soups, one of which is their Sparerb Ho Fun soup (Hieu Tieu Lagu?), except I would order mine with Mein Noodles.  So of course first thing I ordered here was Sparerib Soup with Mein Noodles without even looking at the menu.  To my surprise, they had it available tonight! Except Yusim(sp?) my server said that they can't sub Mein Noodles; no worries as the rice noodles were thick and easy to catch in soup with my coated wood chopsticks.  I also ordered the Minced Pork with Steamed Egg entre.  I could have just ordered this item and a Bok Choy appetizer and been happy, but I was here for the Sparerib Soup. Your meal comes with pickled & Szechuan-peppered cabbage appetizer, and cold Mung Bean soup.  Should have expected this since this Noodle House is related to Chengdu Taste.  The opportune word for the soup and noodles was \"hot\", as it's full of chili oil and Szechwan Peppers, and I even ordered mildly spicy!   No worries, the pickled & peppered cabbage helped clean the palate, and the cold Mung Bean soup balanced the spiciness of the Sparerib Soup.  I couldn't tell the spice level of the minced pork and steamed egg dish since it came after my Sparerib Soup, but it was really good!  The steamed egg was not hard at the sides or bottom like I've disappointedly found elsewhere, so this dish, recommended by the staff, was just bliss!  As for the Sparerib Soup, the \"bones\" aka Spareribs were diced into very small pieces, whereas I am used to them cubed at Vien Huong.  They also diced from top to bottom of the rib, so I had some pieces that had no bone, just cartilage (and yes, I eat the cartilage).  There was no side plate provided, so I had to return (nee: spit) the bones back on the side of the soup bowl opposite me.  The broth, which was tremendously tasty, was just too oily and spicy for me to finish off, so I ate all the noodles, ate the bok choy, and ate everything but the bones on the spareribs leaving the bones in the broth that still took up 1/3 of the bowl.  All in all, the food was excellent, and everything complemented each other.  FYI, the cold Mung Bean soup comes in a mug with unlimited refills, so drink away, especially when you need a break from the spicy, BUT DON'T dip your soup broth spoon like I did because the staff will not refill your cold Mung Bean Soup if they see chili oil, flakes or seeds in it (they'll just bring you a new one).  Ok, as for the service...sigh...I know a good number of Yelpers have complained about the lack thereof, and being that I'm used to Vien Huong's robotic and intentionally mean-spirited rush you in and rush you out service as standard for small venue Noodle Houses, I set the bar really low for Mian.  However, you can only expect them to voluntarily come to your table to take your order, serve your food, bring the bill and clear off your dishes and utensils. If you want extra napkins, ask up front.  If you need a fork, ask when you order.  Don't expect them to come around and ask \"how is your food...your mood....your experience?\" I needed water to dab some chili oil off myself and had to motion to them to come to my table so I could get some water.  I want to say that what they did was enough, and would give them the 5 Stars the food so rightly deserves, but thrice disappointed and once lied to in the past, I needed more than just low bar standard service to justify a move from 1 to 5 Stars , so I'm currently giving them 4 Stars with the promise that I'll come back to give them a chance to increase on their adjusted and vastly improved rating!  Lastly, a reminder: it's a noodle house, and a small one too.  Please don't overstay in your booth after finishing your food.  I saw 4 groups of diners ranging from parties of 2-4 persons leave because there was going to be a wait, and saw such things happening at other tables. My total bill before taxes and tip was only $13.98; dirt cheap for the quality and type of food I received, so I imagine that Mian will have to get people in and out quickly to both keep the doors open and keep the price points as low as they are.  I started this review at 7:00, but quickly got up after settling my bill so that the couple waiting in the tiny foyer could get seated, and not get tempted to leave.  Ok, PSA done, Mian Noodles great, service on par with the low bar I set, and previous grievances forgiven and stored in the past....",

We asked for extra spicy in our noodles.  These aren't the Ma La style of spicy ness, but it was spicy enough to clear the sinuses.  Hot and sour noodle was better than the pork noodles.  The sour beans were crunchy and gave the noodles an extra kick.  The pork noodles didn't have that kick and they were pretty skimpy on the pork quantity.  I had 4 or 5 tiny bite ribs.  Not satisfying for a meat eater.   I'd recommend the hot sour noodles since it's mostly about the noodles anyways.  The spicy beef appetizer was good, nothing spectacular, a little dry, and it's usually a with a little tendon meat part, but this one was all beef so it's more like beef jerky.  I'd give this place a four, i liked it a lot and would come back occasionally.  It is best Sichuan noodle we have found in vegas.  Unfortunately, I  can't give this place a 5 because the menu variety of foods is too small and some of the stuff didn't blow our minds.",

It's cold there year long so people love spicy food to keep warm ( or at least that's what my mom told me).   I got their chengdu zhazheng mian that comes with a spicy sauce( definitely not too spicy) and it comes with veggies fried egg and ground pork. It's broth-less. I thought the dish was really good. At the end the peppers got a little gritty but this is a delicious hearty bowl of noodles. I would have liked more veggies but you can always order extra on the side.  They have non spicy options as well. Also they serve their meals with mung bean soup which is almost like a surgery tea. It seemed like dessert to me and paired really well with their spicy food.   The must try dish here is their steamed egg. I missed it on the menu but my friend ordered it and it was so so good!  It comes in a cup and the egg is topped with a sweet soy sauce and ground beef. The egg texture is so soft and velvety!  It's amazing. I will definitely order that again the next time in back.",

Just by looking at the pictures, the noodles are nice, thick and generously full portions. They are True to their pictures lol    Coming in, we were seated right away and was given the full presentation on how we should order our foods and eat in the way it was presented. There is a paper place mat that has instructions on it to show us how to eat designed by their culture on eating Sichuan noodles.  The waitress knew it was my first time (maybe because of my facial distress looking through their menu), so she referred me their top selling Chef Choices.   I went for the #1 Zha Jiang mian noodles. Top ten best dishes of 2016 from Los Angeles Times Johnathan's Gold Food and Dining. The flavors are very rich and complimenting for the dish. Normally it comes Spicy but I had the option to choose how Spicy I wanted my dish. You can even opt out of the spices if you can't handle it.   My cousin got the House beef noodles but they were very spicy. Our server was very sorry and concerned for him because he was continuously sweating over the spiciness. So very apologetic lol I'm surprised he finished it. His last words were, \"I ain't no bitch\" after he finished the soup.  We were given Mung bean soup which is a traditional beverage from China. It is made of natural mung beans, water, and sugar. We are suppose to drink the mung bean soup during our hot meals, for its cooking and refreshing qualities. It helps balance the Spicy dish so we can enjoy every last bite.   I definitely will come back for more of their delicious dishes. So rich, Spicy, and sweet in the same meal. Thank you Alina for serving us and recommending our dishes to us.",

The noodles were perfect, and the accompanying sauce/soup broth on each were delicious! I liked how on the soup, you could clearly taste a robust beef noodle soup base along with the mala and spice taste.  The wontons were simply flavored, some milky beef broth, green onion and white pepper.   I also liked the cold, lightly sweetened mungbean broth. It helps cool off your mouth in between eating your spicy noodles.",

Server was friendly answered all our questions, and the food came out quickly. The two of we tried the spicy wonton, spicy radish , steam egg thing with mince pork? the steam veggies, and the spare ribs noodle soup.  The spicy radish was very flavorful picked with Sichuan pepper numbing to taste! Good experience if you never tried numbing pepper before! The steam egg with was very very salty though.  I usually love noodle soup, but the spare rib noodle soup was good, but not the best I have had. The noodle itself was very fresh, the soup based was not so impressive. My friend enjoyed the spicy wonton a lot! Must try, the flavor of that was very good",

    "text": "I think this place has the best chinese noodle in town. Their menu is simple, but has enough choices. The menu has a picture for each dish, which helps you in deciding what to order. The prices are also very reasonable. Less than $10 for a noodle dish.  For my first visit, I tried their chengdu style zhajiang noodle with a side order of chicken gizzard. The noodle was cooked perfectly; not too soft, not too chewy. I asked for regular spicy level and found that it had a slight amount of heat, which kept building as I ate more. However, it wasn't too spicy, where it would make it hard for you to eat. I've had sichuan style food that's way spicier where it literally numbed your tongue and made you sweat like crazy. The noodle dish from this place didn't do that to me, so if you like super spicy food, the regular heat level might not satisfy you, so ask for extra spicy. The chicken gizzard was tasty (though it was not a chicken gizzard only, but is rather a chicken giblet) and was actually spicier than the noodle.  They gave you plenty of food and I was struggling to finish my bowl, but if you do need more food, you can ask for extra noodle for free. For drinks, they gave us sweet mung bean soup, which helped cool off the heat and which they would refill.  The only downside is this restaurant is located in the same small plaza, where tea station and ichiza are, so parking can be a challenge during busy time. However, you can always park at the bigger chinatown plaza next door and walk over.",

Service was really good, they had us seated quickly, took our orders, was friendly about refilling out water, and checked in with us, no complaints.  Food-wise, I got the beef noodle soup. I will warn people who aren't used to this to be careful. I can typically handle spicy, but the spicy oil soup is VERY rich and saturated. The noodles and beef were really good, but the soup was a bit much for me personally. I'm sure other people who love really spicy chili oil or this type of food would love it, it's just not my style.  Price was decent, I think our bowls were about $9-10 each which wasn't overpriced or a great value, just in the middle. I will say the amount we got was good, no complaints.  I don't usually eat this style of food, it was my first time. I probably wouldn't go back, but if you like his style of food, this seems like a decent restaurant to go to.",

We had the dumplings in chili oil and the spicy beef noodles and they both were out of this world, the taste was nothing like I've ever had before! We got our noodles on a medium spice level and that was perfect! They served us this tea as soon as we sat down, it was a cold tea and was mild sweetness, yet perfect especially paired with our spicy food! The tea almost soothed the spicy in our mouth! I would highly recommended this place and I can't wait to come back and I literally just ate here, lol their price was amazing and well!! So worth it, I wanna tell everyone about my amazing food experience here!!!!",

It is comparable to the Korean gyaeranjjim, which is one of my favorite side dishes. Mian Sichuan's steamed egg was perfectly cooked (like biting into a solid cloud) and perfectly seasoned (not too salty).   I also got ordered their spicy wontons which came with the sauce on the side (thankfully) and their steamed vegetables. I wasn't a big fan of the wonton sauce (it was sweeter than I prefer), so I ended up pulling all the wontons out of the sauce and eating them basically plain.   Their dishes were clearly made fresh, which I really appreciated. If you stop by, I highly recommend the steamed egg side dish.",

    "text": "So while I was in Vegas for a conference, yes I know, conference capital of America (maybe the world?!); I had to find some good eats.  A quick search on Yelp came up with Mian Sichuan Noodles.  Which seemed to be a good choice as the evening temperature was 40 degrees; yes, 40 degrees in the desert.  After a short ride-share lift, I find myself in front of this seemingly innocuous establishment.  It was a bit early for dinner, but I was hungry from a long day of travel and meetings.  I pull the door handle and am waved down by a staff member in the back, directed towards a table on the side.  I browse through the menu, which is fairly easy and simple and land on spare rib noodles, pickled vegetables and a sweet dessert (because this place is about spice yo, need something to cool off the palate with!).  In a few short seconds, the picked veggies land on my table.  Still crispy with chunks of hot peppers packed between layers of tasty goodness.  It is a nice palate teaser for what was to come with my spare rib noodles.  Then the main event arrives a smoking hot bowl of fresh noodles, drowning in hot smoking broth with cuts of beef spare ribs nestled on top.  I can see the hot oils of fiery goodness floating right on top, all that spice and pepper!  I take a bite and the explosion of hot peppers, chewy noodles and a punch of beef flavor - damn that is good!    It only took a few bites before I reached for my water, as I couldn't take it anymore.  The pickled vegetables were a nice break in between noodle bites.  Finally, after all the yummy goodness (and pain?), my sweet dessert arrives.  Chilled, with crushed peanuts on top, it reminds me of what my Dad used to make when I was a little kid,  The jelly crystal clear, with a sharp sweet hit with each bite; you need to get this!  If you want something good, make your way here; and it isn't that far from the main strip!",

    "text": "Good Szechuan noodle place! Very many dishes to choose from. Honestly favorite was the spicy radish appetizer surprisingly! Would definitely order the appetizer again. I thought the cold noodle was ok. The other noodle entrees were pretty good. Service was ok. Not horrible but not the best either. Their spice levels are interesting... apparently regular is the spiciest compared to mild and medium? Weird. Come try this place out!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I don't eat spicy food, so half of the menu was off the table for us but I ordered the chaoshao and he ordered the zhajiang noodles. We started with the egg appetizer which was delicious and they gave us free mung bean soup. I added more sugar to my soup because I prefer it sweeter.   My chaoshao was delicious, very light broth and flavorful. I had to add some salt to my broth though, but after that addition it was perfect.   The zhajiang on the other hand seemed a bit lacking. I think it mostly had to do with the amount of broth there was compared to proteins/veggies. Not sure if it's just a personal thing, but I'm used to dry zhajiang so making it brothy drowned out the rest of the meat, making it seem like a bowl of primarily broth and noodles (with some leaves of bok choy). My boyfriend also needed to add a little salt to his dish.   They offer a free appetizer with a Yelp review which is why I ordered the steamed egg and got the ok by the waitress, but when the bill came out the waiter told us the Yelp promo was only for the first 4 (cheapest) appetizers in the menu and refused to budge from that misunderstanding. I think this was a product of the language barrier, since the waiters here seemed more comfortable speaking Chinese rather than English, but it really bothered me that they were unwilling to budge from not only their lack of understanding but also the misleading advertising suggesting that any appetizer was included. They could have even at least subtracted the cost of the free appetizer options from the appetizer we ordered. Overall the steamed egg was $2.99 whereas the free options were $1.99, so ultimately they earned $1 extra at the expense of poor service.   Overall food is not bad but my experience here was below par. I would be willing to try this place again but it's definitely not on the top of my list.",

    "text": "VEGAS baby!  Arrived before lunch and my hotel room wasn't ready. Hopped in a Uber to Chinatown. We were dropped off by 7 leaf cafe and walked to this place. We originally walked into the wrong place at the opposite end of the strip mall. Make sure you get the right place it's worth it.   When you're seated you're given the menu and a cold bean drink. These drinks are usually served for dessert at other Asian places. However this version is a lot less sugary and quite refreshing.   We started the meal with the egg appetizer. I can tell you how good this is. If you come here order it, you won't be sorry. Also ordered the steamed veggies. They were steamed baby bok choi, not much seasoning but steamed well.   Now onto the noodles, I ordered the beef noodles, extra spicy with a fried egg and spare ribs.  This was pretty spicy but delicious the beef was very tender and has a great portion size. The one drawback to this dish is that it doesn't come with many veggies to offer an different contrast in taste but that's where the steamed veggies from before come into play.   Overall a solid place for lunch or dinner if it's a cold night or you're craving some great noodles. Order the egg app if you do come here. Service was great as well. There's not much seating so get here before the rush.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place. On the one hand, the Pork Dumplings (drenched in chili oil) was SO good. What did you guys put in these? It had a tinge of sweetness and was just the right amount of spicy. It was our only dish that took forever to come out, so I'm assuming they must be making these fresh in the back? Get it, get it, get it.  I'd also recommend the side dishes we'd got - spicy radish and black fungus - pretty delicious and went well with our entrees. The Chengdu Zhajiang Noodles were next-level yum. The minced pork, fried egg, and chili oil will visit me in my dreams tonight. However, I felt pretty let down by the Spicy Beef Noodles and Spare Pork Rib Noodles. Both were way too salty / oily and lacked differentiation. The pork ribs and beef were just ok and didn't blow me away.  The service was lacking here - my family finished our water within milliseconds (due to the spiciness), and our waters never got refilled until we chased them down a few times. Nobody bothered to give us the check or take it once we had our card down, even though there's a line waiting for our table. They also didn't accept CC, claiming that their system was down, which they did not let us know ahead of time.  I think most of all, the reason I gave Mian Sichuan 3 stars is because I didn't feel great after our meal. I think the sodium and oil (and who knows what else...sugar/MSG?) overload really got to me. Otherwise, I'd recommend you stopping by here to spice up yo life.",

Living in the Bay Area has its perks but good Chinese food is not one of them. I get excited about the food in Vegas and I couldn't wait to drag a few friends to Mian.  I had been to Mian in the SGV so I knew what to expect. The three of us ordered 4 items to share: Pork Dumplings, Spare Ribs Noodles, Cold Noodles, and Chengdu ZaJiang Noodles. All were great. The Spare Rib Noodle was the only soup noodle dish and that was probably the \"least great.\" The others loved the Pork Dumplings but as a True noodle fan, I preferred the noodles.   The spice creeps up on you. It's a good thing they provide mung bean drink to cut through the heat. We couldn't finish all of the food and the total was only $15 per person.",

The amazing noodles swimming in the hot soup, bright red chili oil, and tender, rich pieces of beef, I just couldn't stop smiling. You know that cold water can't touch the heat of a chili oil. So, when you need to cool off the heat, take a sip from the cool mug of sweet mung bean soup. It's lovely in its own right on a hot Las Vegas day, but perfect at taking down the cumulative effect of a hot chili oil.   Mian is the kind of place I need when I crave a perfect bowl of noodles, and lucky me, it's right down the street. With two other locations, one in LA and the other in Honolulu, Mian deserves every bit of the substantial good press they've received.",

Y'all are probably wondering why would a person who cannot eat spicy food come here and all I gotta say is #YOLO.  I ordered the chengdu zajiang dish which was pretty tasty and is a chef's choice! The noodles had a good amount of chew factor and the broth in the dish added plenty of flavor. They could have given a bit more meat and veggies with the dish, but overall it was a good dish. Eating it kind of reminded me of spaghetti with ground beef...just without the marinara sauce.  Another cool thing about this place is that you get this mung bean drink that is really refreshing, cool, and has a hint of sweetness to it. This is meant to help you cool down from the spicy dishes, but it is pretty good even if you don't eat spicy food like me.  Overall I would recommend checking this place out if you love spicy noodle dishes! Even I was able to enjoy this place and would probably come back one day just to see if I can handle eating one of their spicy dishes haha.",

Great side dishes and solid noodles, although I don't like the spicy Sichuan style noodle soups as much as the standard style. Avoid if you don't like spicy, since that's the main draw to this place.  Short Rib Noodle Soup - 4/5. The noodles stuck together a bit too much, but were decent. The meat was very tender and delicious (what's with Vegas noodle places having great meat? the meat in San Francisco Chinese noodle places are generally terrible). Wasn't able to drink the soup since it was super spicy, but I guess it's to be expected from this style of noodles.  Pig Head - 5/5. Best version of this I've had in a while. Just chewy enough without being too tough, and well seasoned.   Steamed Egg - 4/5. Standard steamed egg with some sauteed shredded pork thrown on top. The pork was a nice touch bumping this up by a bit, since the sauce paired well with the unseasoned egg.  Seaweed - 3/5. Mostly standard, though well seasoned.   Mung Bean Soup - 4/5. Perfect for cooling down after all of the spice. I must have drank 5 cups of this stuff while I was here...",

In an unassuming strip joint (not the dirty kind), we walked into Mian Noodles. After asking for recommendations, we settled on the Zhajiang Mian and the special Chengdu cold noodles. We selected the radish appetizer and the marinated pork appetizer as well. Tip #1, check in, write a note get 1 of 4 free appetizer options. Tip #2 if you want the spare ribs with your noodles, don't get here when it opens. They cook it in the morning and takes about an hour to finish.   Onto the food. The radish appetizer was surprising! Slightly sweet, texturally rubbery and a little spicy. Sure doesn't sound appetizing when written in words, but don't knock it til you try it! Especially if it's free :) Next up was the marinated pork. We thought it was like meat meat, but I believe it was more like pork jowl. For those who've had it, it's either a love or hate; there is no inbetween.   The noodles themselves were super flavorful and chewy. The cold noodle was a sesame, peanut base slightly sweet and the zhajiang mien was savory with a soy sauce based sauce and minced pork and some baby bok Choy. Wash down the meal with complementary mung bean water and this makes for a fantastic low price meal for two!",

The chili oil wontons are absolutely spectacular, the noodles have just the right texture, and the broth's real good for a satisfying slurp fest.   They even have a cute paper table cover and very well decorated menus. I'm surprised by their attention to detail and the authenticity of their noodles. You can get'em real spicy with sichuan peppers or, if you don't want to be sweating your socks off, go for a refreshing clear broth zajiang noodles like I did (sweating in Las Vegas is killer lol). I'd definitely go here again and recommend you do the same ;) 5/5 food and design",

I was also super excited to order the steamed egg with minced pork, but unfortunately, that was not available at the time. When the noodles came out I was very excited. My first experience at MIAN in San Gabriel was great. I thought that the noodles were sooooooo good.   Unfortunately, the Las Vegas location was a bit let down. The noodles ended up being bland and very oily. I was able to try the Spicy Black Fungus and thought it was pretty good. They're pickled.   I will definitely make a trip to one in SoCal soon to make up for this experience.",

Lightly sweetened mung bean soup is served instead of water when seated. (You can ask for water too). My mother used to make mung bean soup growing up so it was a very homey touch when I saw it. Upon ordering, the server will ask what level spice do you prefer if the item you're ordering is spicy.   Chili oil chaoshou, spare rib noodles (spice level: medium), and house beef noodles (spice level: medium). The house beef noodles soup was more spicy compared to the spare rib noodles when both spice level was medium. Both the beef and spare ribs were super tender and delicious. The chili oil chaoshou is basically a pork dumpling in hot chili oil which I find to be absolutely scrumptious!! The meat was juicy and flavorful while the chili oil compliments it very well.   Definitely give MIAN a try if you love everything noodles and spice!!",

Unfortunately the wait was 30 minutes and we wanted to eat quickly so we could get back to activities on the Strip.  SPICY BLACK FUNGUS I ordered the Spicy Black fungus side, which has a light pickled flavor and it tasted pretty fresh and crisp. It came at a decent size and price. Got it for free for writing a Yelp review.  SICHUAN COLD NOODLES Their typical noodles served not quite icy cold, but cold enough. The sweet and spicy paste should be mixed so that the flavor is dispersed throughout the noodles. Like with the other dishes, the add-one are all extra priced except for the free 100g noodles. I tried the fried egg and intestines. The egg was a bit over cooked as the egg yolk had become chalky. The intestines on the other hand were nicely stewed which was a nice complement to the dish. The only thing I did not like was that on its own the noodles are kind of plain. At their price point, I feel like they should put a little more into it to make it more interesting.",

The spicy, peanut Szechuan pepper sauce is sooo delicious and the noodles are always cooked just right!!  Warning though: the sauce includes a heaping scoop of fresh, ground garlic! Vampires be gone!!    I love that you can get extra noodles for FREE and their appetizers are tasty and a good size. The spicy radish and spicy black fungus are my faves!!  At $1.99, the portion is generous and those peppers in the spicy black fungus?! Whooo, they spice up any fungi!!! K, won't take up mushroom with puns...onto my review~  To help settle all the spice, you are given a Mian mug filled with a cold, slightly sweetened mung bean drink.  It is MAGIC!  It subdues the spicyness so you can continue enjoying the heat!! :P On my most recent visit, they didn't have it though.  Hoping they were just out for the day.  I have tried some of the soup dishes and other non-soup dishes, but the Szechuan cold noodle is where it's at!!",

We got the spicy radish, the cold noodles, and the hot and sour noodles. Both noodle dishes were so flavorful and delicious. You can add additional items to your dishes such as meat, fried egg, etc.  The noodles were really the star of the dishes we tried. They were so fresh and chewy, and what's better is that you can get extra noodles for free (although we didn't because the portion size was already pretty filling). They also give a really tasty free appetizer - cabbage in Sichuan spices. This was probably better than the radish we ordered, so you may want to try it first before deciding to order an appetizer. The mung bean drink also goes well with the food and helps numb the spices a bit. Yum.  The flavor was so on point here. Spicy without being too overwhelming and just the right amount of mala. Wish we had this restaurant in the Bay area. Prices are also very, very reasonable. Service was fast. Skip the buffets and come here instead.",

I ordered the house beef noodle and shared the pork dumplings. The medium spice for the noodle was a pretty good level for this lover of spicy foods, but I may opt for the next level of spice in the future to truly get that mouth numbing sensation. I also enjoyed the noodles that were just the perfect texture.   Strangely, the pork dumplings were served when I had almost finished my noodles. Oh man, they were worth the wait though. The sauce they were dumped in (heehee), was slightly sweet and so delicious. There were 12 in an order.  I was stuffed after my meal. I'm glad there are locations in southern California close to where I live. I'd definitely go back!",

    "text": "My buddy was in town and looking for something different. We'd already been to Yummy Box (great food) and weren't feeling like AYCE sushi so we thought we'd give Mian Sichuan Noodles a try. We went on a Tuesday evening around 8PM and the place wasn't too busy and we were seated immediately. The staff was pretty attentive. The interior was nice, clean, and quiet. Keep in mind this is a Tuesday evening so other days and weekends might be different.  Here's what we ordered and what we thought:  Spicy Radish - This was crunchy and spicy. Tasted picked and vinegary. It wasn't bad and very reminiscent of Korean kimchi   Marinated Pork - This was actually pork snout which made the meat kind of crunchy and chewy at the same time. If you have an aversion to pig snout then don't order this. The overall flavor wasn't bad, seasoned to be slightly spicy/salty?  Spare Rib Noodles - This was very good according to my friend. It was spicy, but overall he felt the quantity of meat was a bit skimpy. He also ordered a side of chicken gizzard which was chewy but very salty and spicy.  Zajiang Noodles with Peas (minced pork in dry noodles with egg) - This overall wasn't bad. The spiciness wasn't that bad at first, but it started to build up and became quite spicy. Over easy fried egg was okay. Minced pork was flavorful. Peas were meh. Overall this dish was fine.  Bone Soup ChaoShou (wonton soup) - This was not spicy. Clear broth was pretty light in the flavor department. Wontons were the same in that they weren't really flavorful or stand out. They could use some soy sauce or something else. Overall it felt like it was a filler item like fries to a burger. It's something else you order to go along with your main dish, but by itself it's not really anything.  SPOILER ALERT - Everything we ordered and had was SPICY. Burn your taste buds spicy! I was wearing a cap when I first started, but by the end I had to remove it since I was sweating from the spiciness.  Overall, I felt the food was A-okay hence the 3 stars (not terrible, just not for me). I can't really see myself going back since I wasn't really a fan of this kind of food especially when there are so many other options around on Spring Mountain.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FhPEiQW52Jko&s=a548ea40eeb90e8c58609504acebc28dcd5826d7d8c2a1f9df1d61c77d70c4c9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/hPEiQW52Jko</a>",

    "text": "Mian is an authentic style Szechuan Noodle Restaurant located in China Town in a small strip mall next to the China Town Plaza. This isn't a fancy place but you come here for the food.  They have cute placemats on the tables with instructions on how to eat the food and also to Yelp about your experience.  I enjoyed that they start you off with cold cup of sweetened mung bean soup that you drink to relieve you from mouth numbing spicy heat from the food.  We started off with the spicy radishes. They came out almost instantly after we ordered them with a small dish of complimentary sweet and sour slightly spicy cabbage. I liked the radishes. They were really different to me and I never had anything like them before. They were sort of spicy and crunchy.....sort of light. They sort of got me excited to try Szechuan Noodles.  I tried the Szechuan Cold Noodles. The actual noodles were very good and were silky and chewy and long I thought they were perfect. My noodles were slightly spicy.....so I was disappointed because I was expecting them to be at least as spicy as the radishes but really was hoping for fiery mouth numbing noodles. The taste to me was also something new and different to me. It was slightly sour but also had a small amount of sweetness to it....I didn't dis-like it but it's not something I crave.....  My husband got the Za Jiang with Peas (pork noodles). He asked for as spicy as they make it. His dish did come out spicier than mine but it was the same heat as the radishes. I tasted a small amount of his and I liked the flavors better in his dish.  When I say spicy people hear mild..........",

    "text": "The restaurant was a bit hard to find using the GPS because we were automatically drawn to the adjacent Chinatown Plaza instead of this small strip mall.  To be honest, this was our plan B noodle stop on our visit to Vegas.  It saved the day after we ditched our first stop due to the long wait-list.  Oddly, the place had no line at all when we got here - around 12 noon on a Sunday.  \"Mian\" is the Mandarin word for noodle. A rather rare sighting because here in US we tend to see the Cantonese equivalent, \"mein\", a lot more often; e.g. lo mein, chow mein, etc). Anyway, needless to say, noodles are their specialty here and I love noodles!  After we were seated, we were automatically served with a pitcher of mung bean tea. I'm not sure if this is the West Coast thing -- I've never had mung bean tea in my life and yet this was the second place that served it during our short visit. It was nice and soothing.  OK on to the dishes:  Piquant Intestine Noodle Soup $8.99. This was the first time I had it. It's exotic for sure. The spicy broth went very well with the chewy intestines. It was good.  House Beef Noodle Soup $9.99. This was the best dish among what we ordered. Beef was extremely tender and the broth very tasty with a hint of sweetness.  Chengdu ZaJiang Noodle $8.99. Not recommended. The serving size was tiny. It should have been a small plate. The ground pork was of the run-of-the-mill soy sauce marinade variety.  For all three, the noodle itself was unimpressive. It didn't really stand out as particularly good.  Service was excellent; however, it hit a sour note when I was told that I would receive a free appetizer if I show them a 5 star review... I had to pass.",

We ordered it at a medium spicy level and it was just right. Would definitely order this again the next time I come back.   4 stars for the house beef noodle soup. Noodles were also perfectly cooked and the beef chunks were plenty tender and flavorful. Only thing is the broth is more numbing spicy oil than beef soup, so if you're more into the Taiwanese style sweet and spicy beef noodle soup than the Szechuan numbing spice kind, this is a bit intense. Medium spicy was borderline too spicy for me, and I'm a high spice tolerance girl.   We also ordered the spicy black fungus and devoured it in less than 3 minutes. Delicious.   Service was great, got seated quickly and was immediately given a pitcher of cold mung bean drink. Perfect after coming in from 100 degree Las Vegas weather, and cuts the spice of the food surprisingly well! Would come back to try their other house recommendations and reorder that Zajiang mian!",

It seems as if Mian has the perfect noodles to go with a spicy broth. You can make some items mild but their normal spicy is definitely a hint spicier than I can take. Each bowl averages about $9.99. I came and ordered the house special beef noodle soup. Must try!  Also ordered the chili oil with their version of wontons. So delicious and picture worthy! What I love about this place is that their menu has a picture to go with each item. They also bring your food out super fast.

The place is well lit, clean, and has a very customer friendly menu -- easy to understand what the options are, which is spicy, and which is soupy. I'd like to stay unbiased for this review since I personally do not enjoy and cannot eat any spicy food, but from what I can see and smell off of the spicy dishes we ordered, they are legit. Just beware if you don't eat spicy food, your only noodle options will have no meat in them. Some non-spicy options I enjoyed are the minced pork steam egg and the non-spicy wonton. I'd come back again to take friends here -- especially ones who like the spicy Sichuan style.",

I really enjoyed the noodles as well, when you mix the noodles, sauce and onions it creates something simple yet flavorful.

As for flavor, meal was so tasteless and oily we took a few bites, paid for our uneaten food and left. My appetite was ruined and we left unsated and dissatisfied.",

I only tried the Hauxing Fried Egg Noodle, but it had a great tomatoey flavor to it. But what really blew me away about this place was their Chili Oil Chaoshou. The Chili Oil had such a deep and complex flavor. It was salty, sweet, spicy, savory... But none of the individual flavors were too overpowering.   There's this cool modern style that resonates throughout the restaurant from their menus to the good presentation. I can't wait to return.",

I went with a lighter spice level on the house beef noodle, which ended up perfect for me.  The dark beef broth was saltier and less sweet than some of other beef noodle soups that I've had.  Very flavorful.  The beef pickled noodle had a distinctively different broth.  Light in color, but heavily seasoned with numbing spice (peppercorn), which the waiter did warn us about.   And he wasn't kidding! Both my wife and I couldn't feel our mouths after a few bites.  The broth flavor was good, but we probably would've enjoyed it more if it had less peppercorn.  Overall the food was good and we appreciate our waiter for being upfront about the food.  Would definitely come back again.",

I was there once before and the intestine noodle soup was good except that the veggies and intestine was noticeably less than what they used to give out (based on the posted pictures from customers on yelp reviews) or it was just that one time unlucky for me, the chef did not give me much but since I was craving for it so I still drove all the way to the restaurant to get my favorite noodle soup. I was there at around 11:25am on Saturday. They were a little busy and a few people were waiting to be seated. So I decided to order for take out instead of waiting. When I asked the waitress for takeout orders, she was so rude: \"these people sitting here still did not place their orders yet so you need to wait 30 minutes.\" So I was like, wow....I have never had to wait 30 minutes to place a takeout order. I can understand waiting for a table. That's just ridiculous!!! Then, of course I just left disappointed and dissatisfied. That's the worst customer service I have ever experienced in a restaurant.",

I understand they removed all the booths/ decor from the previous tenant. But they didn't bother covering up any holes or patch up the walls with new paint. There's several hanging lights missing. Personally to me.. if a restaurant is new, I expect it to look like the previous tenant cuz it's reusable or something new and turn key.  I don't wanna dine in a place that looks like someone just moved out.  Staff: Staff is friendly and nice.  We were greeted promptly and water and comp appetizers arrived right away after we sat down.  My only complaint is the staff is constantly on their cell phone. They are super nice and polite when you get their attention but they're not very attentive on their own.  Food: We ordered the steamed egg with minced meat.  Came out super fast.  A little too salty for me but my husband thought it was good.   Then he ordered the first thing on the menu, pig intestines noodle.  All we tasted was the heavy peppercorn and no other depth of flavor coming through.  My husband had to ask for soysauce and vinegar to tweak it.  I ordered the Hot and Sour Noodle which was tasty and I loved the thin homemade noodle texture. Doesn't blow my mind, but it was a good choice.  Likeliness to return: For what it is, we're probably not going to return.  So far there isn't a flavor that I crave.  However, it's not terrible so should any friends wanna dine here we wouldn't refuse.  Likeliness to Recommend: Less likely.",

I'm not a big fan of hot noodle soup serves in chemical filling melamine bowl so I walked right out.",

I don't mind spicy but my stomach minds it. a lot. so every time we order, he requests no numbing spice and I request less spicy. both of us are content with our foods every single time! my favorite item is the house beef noodle less spicy and it's the perfect amount of spice for me every time.   also, I could live off of that mung bean soup. I'm not kidding. it pairs with their noodles so well. I just can't.   the only thing we were slightly disappointed in was the steamed egg because it had little to no flavor. the texture was amazing, but it was pretty \"eh\" to us. but that's ok, I just want noodles and soup and we good.",

I tried the wontons and their noodles with ground pork.  They give you a big bowl of noodles and the broth is flavored nicely, albeit spicy. However at the end I realized I was still quite hungry, so really you're not getting enough bang for your buck. Yes you can order more noodles but by then you're out of meat and veggies to go with it.  The wontons are average but they charge an arm and a leg for them.",

The name of the game is Szechuan, spicy noodles.  They don't have many other dishes other than a few appetizers so get your mind focused on noodles!  The four of us all ordered different things. I liked my mom's the best - the intestine noodles.  The intestines were very tender and nicely seasoned.    Brother ordered the hot and sour wontons which I felt were really good.  He thought the regular spicy wontons were better (less soupy).    Hubby's minced pork noodles went so fast so I guessed he liked it?  Finally, my noodles.  I wasn't in the mood for spicy so I got their bone broth noodles.  This did not come with any meat so I added some beef.  I wasn't a huge fan of this.  The soup was ok...but not really great paired with noodles. The broth was already sort of on the light side.  Paired with noodles, it just washed out the whole dish. Also the side of beef was super hard and not nearly cooked down enough.    For the sides, we really liked the cloud mushroom dish.  We ended up ordering two of them.  Service was nice.  They were very generous with their offer of green bean soup refills (nice and refreshing to go with the spicy foods).  If you're in the mood for spicy noodles, definitely come have a bowl here!",

The wood ears () appetizer was amazing. Beef noodle soup () was okay. My wife grew up in china and we both love authentic chinese food, especially if it's spicy().  We're definitely come back again whenever we're in Vegas.",

The menu isn't big, but offers several noodle dishes (mian means noodle), almost all of which are less than $10. You also get served complimentary pickled cabbage and complimentary refillable green bean soup (I LOVE green bean soup). To top it off, they also provide FREE unlimited noodle refills.  The noodle dishes are all very authentic and tasty. The noodles themselves are fresh and chewy as well. Service is decent. Decor is quaint, especially with all of the comment cards hung up.  All in all, between the taste, freebies, and value for price, I highly recommend Mian for a quick and inexpensive yet delicious meal.",

Egg was smooth and the minced pork had a nice subtle sweet flavor to it.  - spicy back fungus: this one was alright also. It was spicy but they also put too much vinegar in it and that overpowered the spiciness.   Noodles: - Spare rib soup and Spicy house beef soup: both soup had the same broth (at least they tasted the same to me).  The soup itself was okay. It had a layer of chili oil on the top which is expected in Szechuan cooking. I wasn't a big fan of the meat in each dish. Both the spare ribs and chunks of beef felt rough.  Overall, I most likely won't come back. It wasn't enough to wow me and plus, it's kinda far.",

    "text": "Came here right before they closed for a couple of hours before the dinner shift, so it was pretty empty. The food here is ok. Sichuan dishes are an acquired taste. Service was fine since there was hardly anyone there. The prices were also decent. They started us out with a mung bean tea drink when we sat down. It's pretty tasty with a small hint of sweetness, but it does not look appetizing at all. We ordered the spare ribs noodle and the pickled beef noodle, both with an egg.  Spare rib noodle: i love spicy food, but it's kind of overpowering. Kind of like if you dumped a whole jar of chili oil in it, its not spicy but the flavor is too much. The noodles and bok choy were cooked fine. The noodles are similar to ramen noodles. The spare ribs tasted different, almost a gaminess kind of flavor. Not the flavors I was expecting.  Pickled beef noodle: this is a weird dish. It's kind of like a strong rosemary flavor, but the aftertaste numbs your mouth and is not a good feeling. The noodles were cooked fine, but I could not get past that rosemary numbness.   I probably wouldn't come back here again. It's different than the typical Asian noodles such pho, ramen, or udon. You have to have a certain palate for these kinds flavors to enjoy it.",

To begin with I came alone and waited 10 minutes to be seated and I was the only one waiting.. then there was a dirty table that he finally cleaned and sat me there. The stench of whatever cleaning product he used was overbearing. Then when I asked for help with the menu and ask him how big the pork dumplings were, he said \"2\". I repeated back 2? As in only 2 pork dumplings for about 8$ he said yes so I ordered that along with the beef noodles. I underestimated how spicy the beef noodles were and that was terrible I didn't even finish them. Then the pork dumplings they were okay but it was so much. And the customer service was just okay not great. Wouldn't go back.",

The appetizers are pretty affordable like $2 each.  Service: As soon as I walked in, the waitress greeted me and guided me to the seats. Instead of serving water, they serve green beans soup, it's free and refillable! They refill my cup for at least three times, very nice service.  Environment: the tables and chairs are made of wood, lots of customers notes hanging on the wall. It's a chill and casual dining place.  Food: I love the noodle that I ordered, which was special gizzard noodles, the gizzard doesn't gave me lots of surprises, but the noodle was bomb. The seasoning and the sauces were awesome. I only had little bit left over after I'm done eating, and I'm still taking it home.  Overall: No doubt that this place would be my first choice if I'm craving for Chinese noodle. Fair price and nice service.",

The hot & sour noodle is a little less spicy than the spare ribs noodle but it has incredible combination of sour & spice and a nice contrast with the crunchy soy beans sprinkled on it. The spare ribs are tender and a nice combination with the noodle. We'll be back whenever we are in town!",

The noodles had a fine hand-pulled quality like I recall from my trip to China. They were great noodles!  Unfortunately there was no way to cool down the noodle soup once ordered too spicy. My fault. They will generously provide more noodles if you wish and we were offered a cold mung bean drink which was delicious and refreshing.

No fear though, they will happily bring you a side dish of chili oil if you ask. I ordered the spicy sour noodle soup and my husband got the beef noodle soup. We definitely like the beef noodle the best. The broth was very rich and beefy and the noodles were nice and springy. Service was great considering there is just one guy working the whole front when we went. We will be back!",

My husband found Mian Sichuan Noodles on Yelp and we decided that's where we were going to have lunch.   It's fun reading the paper cover while waiting. The noodles are fresh. I love the wontons both in non-spicy soup and the spicy sauce. It was very flavorful. The wonton did not have seafood. It's a bonus for me only because I am allergic. They serve mung bean soup. It's a nice touch. Water was not needed with our meal. We may eat at the location in Los Angeles too! The service was great. The waitress is friendly.",

    "text": "Warning: Szechuan spiciness is very different from the normal spiciness that we see in other cuisines. The heat coats your tongue, giving you that numbing feeling and heats you up from the inside over time. It's different from other spiciness where you feel the kick right away, even burning your lips if you get the sauce on it; therefore, be mentally prepared if this is your first time experiencing Szechuan cuisine.  With that being said, this place captures that burning flavor so well. They let you choose your spiciness level in each dish, I'd recommend starting out with 'mild' if this is your first time.  I ordered the house-beef noodle and I was not disappointed. The noodles were amazing and the broth that accompanied it was delicious, best I've had so far in Las Vegas.  In addition to the delicious spicy meal, the restaurant offers you a mug of mung-bean soup, which you consume like a tea, which helps to cool down your body temperature after your meal.   It's great that the customers are offered these drinks; however, it's also where this restaurant loses a star from my rating. The mung-bean soup that we're given were very little in quantity, it did not even fill up past half-way in the mug. Often in restaurants that I go to, the drink cups are fully filled, or comes within a big container for the customer to fill themselves. With the mung-bean soup being such a vital part to the meal, I'd expect the restaurant to give its customers a fully-filled mug.  Overall this restaurant is a great place to stop by to experience the burning essence of Szechuan flavor, perfect for cold days in Las Vegas.",

There was only one customer seated.  It took the staff a good 5 minutes before I was approached with a serving of the mung bean juice.    I can't compare Mian with the other places I've been to down in San Gabriel Valley (CA) because there's no comparison despite the very good reviews posted on their walls.  Food was alright, but not worth going back to.   I'll save my cravings for Sichuan spicy noodles when am down in LA.",

My entree was the zijiang noodles with pork - med spice. I could not stop eating them - spicy, creamy, and so flavorful - the only thing I wish was different was for the egg to not be so done. It was hard to cut with my chopsticks and didn't integrate well in the dish. A creamy egg would have been much better IMO.  The really interesting aspect of the meal is the mung bean soup - which was really more like a tea. It's the perfect foil to the spicy noodles and was delightfully refreshing!   I don't live in Vegas, but I hope to visit the Mian Noodle shop in Los Angeles some day.",

I was so surprised and excited to discover it when I first came to the restaurant. The waitress was kind enough to make me a to-go drink of it. Lol.

Such good flavor! The noodle dish had good heat, but wasn't overly spicy. My lips and tongue were tingling though!  The noodles were a good texture. Lots of garlic. Total flavorbomb! It's vegan too!  The pork dumplings in chili oil were one of the better versions I've had. I liked that they packaged the dumplings separately from the sauce. Lemme tell you, that sauce is crack! It has a hint of sweetness which makes it oh so tasty!   I like how the menu is organized and you know which dishes are: soup, no soup, vegan, spicy, not spicy.   I'm looking forward to my next visit here already!",

    "text": "This was my first time trying authentic Sichuan Noodles so I don't have much of a reference point but I know I liked what I had and so did everyone else in my party.   In Vegas kind of late and getting hungry, started Yelping for a noodle house. Typical Ramen shops popped up but this one caught my eye primarily because the photos and description looked very authentic when compared to the You Tube videos by The Food Ranger Trevor James eating his way around China. I was a little skeptical not realizing that Las Vegas has an area that has become a booming Asia Town in terms of shops and eateries.   We arrived at 8:45 pm and the place was empty but started filling up as we sat. Being unsure of much on the menu, we had a conversation with our server about what taste profiles we liked, what we were looking for and what some of her favorites were. She gave great advice along with a small free starter of pickled cabbage and some cold mung bean sweet soup that really was more of a refreshing beverage that cuts the heat more than anything.   As the food arrived, I was amazed by the new flavor profiles, especially the mouth-numbing quality of the Sichuan peppercorns and I loved how you can specify the spice level of your dish. If you want it hotter, just let them know. I thought about a piquant intestine noodle dish but opted for the spare rib noodle dish which was fantastic. Sampled everyone else's too and nobody got a bad meal.   The food was great and the setting/menu/taste is unique enough that it stimulates a lot of social conversation at the table unless, I suppose, you are dining with people that are experts on this regional cuisine. The food really was unique but I can easily see how it is a comfort food of Northern China. In the end, we spent about $40 for a party of 3 and had more food than we could possibly eat but it was a great experience and definitely a recommended non-ramen noodle place for the area.",

I don't like their customer service I agree with a few others who have expressed poor customer service here as well. I don't know if it's a race thing but I hate to say it. I noticed others whom are asian being treated with better customer service than those who are darker or latino, the first few times I came I was with a few Caucasian friends in which I received better customer service...don't know what that's all about but times have changed and this shouldn't be an issue money is money and customer service or quality of food shouldn't be sabotaged...it's unfortunate they will start losing more customers if this continues.",

We both ordered the hot and sour noodles and it hit the mark with a bullseye.  It was like an explosion in my mouth.   You can add additional meats and fillers for the soup for a minimal price.  We added pork, spare rib and beef.   I was surprised when a bowl of noodles filled me up.  The quantity/quality/bargain combination was unbelievable.

We got the free mung bean soup which I never had before in drink form from a restaurant. It was perfectly refreshing for a hot day! We all ordered various kinds of noodles and they were all very good. The only surprise with my hot and sour noodles was that it really didn't come with anything other than an egg. Not even veggies which is strange since it was vegetarian. Anyways, I ordered a side of veggies so that solved that problem. My kids loved the dumpling soup. Then for dessert we had the jelly dessert. It was also very refreshing and tasty. The only caveat would be to order sides because the noodles don't come with much toppings.",

It was completely bland; each mouthful of noodles just tasted like oil. I am 99% sure they forgot to add any salt or spices whatsoever to my bowl, as I tasted my boyfriend's and it at least had somewhat of a kick (not much, but it was something) Service: 2/5 No one came to check up on us after dropping off our food, so I didn't get to address my issue with the horrible soup. Also, we asked for pickled vegetables and were just told \"no\" by the waitress.   Overall, the restaurant itself is clean and I liked the setup. The complimentary cold mung bean soup was a nice touch! There are plenty of great restaurants in the area though, so I doubt I'd come here again since the soup was just so awful.",

    "text": "Re: food, refer to the other 200 reviews. I'm in agreement. I come here often and will continue to do so.  When you come here, though, be aware that your favorite items may not be available. It is a truly terrible feeling to have your cravings denied, akin to the deep pangs of regret felt when you're lactose intolerant and the belly rumbles violently after one too many scoops of ice cream.   Allow me to spell it out for you. Of my approximately 20 trips (yes, I really love this place):  -4x they have not had the spare rib noodles in stock. Twice before noon. -3x they have \"run out\" of mung bean soup. Twice before noon. -1x I was given the last pour of mung bean soup, and the next customers that entered were handed a pitcher of water. -2x they did not have house beef noodles. -1x they did not have the steamed eggs available. Eggs. Eggs! Eggs!! Eggs!!! Eggs!!!! Eggs!!!!! -1x upon ordering the marinated pork, I was given a half portion without explanation. I didn't confirm, but I suspect it was due to low stock. -On the bright side, they always have the wood ear fungus, which is delicious.  These are all regular menu items, the mung bean soup in particular, which is delivered to every customer and heavily featured in their promotional materials as a differentiating factor. How are you not able to keep that on-hand to serve?  Who's in charge of this second-rate operation? Where's management? Is it a supply chain issue? Do they need to hire somebody to be responsible for inventory/ordering?  Is there a customer who sporadically and unpredictably comes in and places 137 orders to-go at 9 o'clock of the exact same items I like to order, thus depleting their stock?  Mian: One of life's great mysteries. Like the age of the universe. Or Fermi bubbles. Or how Daenerys traversed half the known world in one hour.* Elon Musk, you have some catching up to do.  *Spoiler? Oops.",

These dumplings are soaking in this incredible soup, that I can't really explain to you. All I know is that it's a combination of sweet, salty, spicy, and savory. I would drink it if I could.   Next, the Huaxing Fried Egg Noodles. You have these perfectly cooked noodles sitting in a rich, savory, but also lightly sour broth. And the tomato they add, gives it a slight sourness that cuts through the savoriness of it.   This is one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.",

The beef was abundant and melt in your mouth braised to perfection. The noodles were excellent and flavorful. I also thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary mung bean soup and pickled cabbage.

The beef soup had exceed all expectations. The soup was flavorful and the beef was tender. My mom ordered the Ma-Lat noodles.. and boy does this dish live up to its name. First sips had my entire lips numb and tingly. Apparently the Szechuan pepper do that to you. The soup base on both dish was on point. Can't wait to come back!  We also ordered 2 appetizers. The radish was just okay for me, although my mom loved them. Some of the radish were too hard to chew. The fungus, on the other hand, was the best fungus dish I've ever had in my entire life. I'm a huge fan of vinegar - and this dish had the perfect combination of sour and sweet similar to pickled fungus.   For desert, we ordered 2 of the sweet jelly. This was definitely not something I've ever had before. If you like nuts - I definitely recommend this. Otherwise, if you're not a peanut lover like me, don't order this.   Ohhhh and how can I forget the kung bean soup!?? This restaurant serves kung bean soup for your drink! No need to order water -- as this soup will help cool your mouth from the burning sensation from the spicy noodles! The mung bean soup has a hint of sweetness to it, and the fact that mung beans are good for you - make this place a top contender for me for favorite noodle restaurant in Las Vegas!   The restaurant is small but very comfortable. No wait for a Sunday afternoon.",

    "text": "New noodle shop located where Yagyu Ramen used to be. They have another location in San Gabriel, California.   FOOD: Menu is not very ingredient specific. It only tells you 3 out of the 6 ingredients so beware if you're vegetating. Presentation is also poor, mine looked as if it had already been stirred for me.   Hauxing Fried Egg Noodles was served with thin noodles which I enjoyed and seemed to be vegetarian but because it was not marked I'll assume the broth was a meat broth. It was tasty and had almost a tomato soup style broth with a fried egg on top, tomato chunks and green onion. I don't know that I would this one again as I prefer clear broths but it was definitely tasty!   Chili Oil Chaoshou is a none soup dish. Just steamed dumpling sitting in a yummy bath of spicy chili oil was fantastic, although I wish the menu said what type of meat it was because I have no idea what I ate now. Otherwise the tastes were fantastic and was not over steamed.   ATMOSPHERE: Very plain inside, there is nothing on the bare white walls. There is one little tv in the wall turned off that looks to be the same one as the previous tenant. The only other decorations are two of their soup cups by the restaurant entry. It also looks as if there is the same brown wood furniture as the previous tenant.   STAFF AND SERVICE: Very friendly staff however not a very good flow of who handles customers walking in and those dining. We were approached by someone from the register and given menus while we stood at the door along with 4 other people waiting to dine. Upon entry there is a clip board with lines on it hanging so you can write in your party name and how many dining. Once seated they brought soup and water out immediately after being seated and the food came out very quickly which was great for the lunch hour. I definitely could have waited an additional minute if it made the appearance of my dish better though. There's no fun instagraming it as their place mat suggests if it's a messy bowl of food.   Overall I'll go again should someone mention we dine there.",

    "text": "I've been holding off on this review for a while, but I've eaten here enough times now to say that this is most likely the best noodle spot in Las Vegas. The location it's in was once my favorite ramen restaurant in the valley, and this location remains a crown jewel in Chinatown with its signature spicy noodles.  To begin with, the food is incredible and has a nice kick to it. The best dish in my opinion is the Chengdu Zhajiang Noodles (with or without peas). Every bite is bursting with flavor and spicy goodness, and after you've eaten enough you get a nice tingly feeling in your mouth, thanks to the Sichuan pepper. And to cool down, you're given this sweet and delicious mung bean soup (free of charge!), which is a bit of an addiction for me.   The food is spicy, but not too spicy; the flavor remains prominent regardless of what part of the dish you're eating. The noodles are a perfect texture, not tough but not at all mushy. And the meat and veggies are cooked to perfection.  This may be hyperbole to some, but I believe this to be the perfect noodle bowl. It has reached the perfect, noodly equilibrium I seek out in a dish such as this.  Now I want you to understand that their regular spice level may be too spicy to some. I have had friends and family tell me, \"I'm gonna have to order mild next time.\" But I think that's the best thing about this place. It IS spicy. There are so many \"spicy\" restaurants out there that don't give me a semblance of a kick. This isn't one of them. People who are spice enthusiasts and those with more sensitive tastes can find something to love at this restaurant.  There isn't much to say about the staff except that they stay on top of their game and are super friendly. They've always tended to my needs accordingly.  Anyhow, rather than continuing to ramble, I'll leave it at this: Try this place, you will most definitely want to come back and I promise that you will not regret it.",

It was a Monday evening and we were seated immediately. The place was casual but very clean. I ordered the house beef noodle with fried egg and found the broth to be delicious. It was not too spicy or salty. My only complaint was amount of beef, but what was in there was very tender. My father got the pork and I tasted his and thought it was very good too. He also enjoyed it. My mom didn't want anything spicy end ordered the tomato noodle soup. She loved the flavor and said it tasted very fresh with the sliced tomatoes. Great experience and we'll definitely be back.",

Radish fermented like an ultra crunchy kimchi.  Egg custard with beef (similar to a chawanmushi) All the dumplings are good, I like the pork in chili oil varietals but the savory broth versions are great as well, portions are very large.  Entree highlights were cold Szechuan noodle, bone broth soup with noodle and pickled beef noodle.  If it was more expensive it would be three stars as in the large scheme of Szechuan flavors it was mild and one dimensional. But value for the cost is good and the service team was kind and attentive. (Also msg usage was mild).",

They offer various levels of spiciness which was a good thing. I think medium is hot enough for most people.  This is my first experience eating authentic Sichuan dishes.  We will be back.  I highly recommend Mian.",

We accidentally arrived this place and decided to give it a try. This is a small restaurant but is very clean. The staff here are very friendly. They have cool mung bean soup in this hot summer day for free and refill instead of ice water. They also brought in Sichuan pickles as our appetizer. The pickle was authentic, not like Cantonese styled. Their Manu is short but every single dishes are tasty just as it is supposed to be. We ordered spicy sour wonton, house special rib noodle and Chengdu minced meat noodle. All tasted fabulous!  We definitely will come back. It beats any buffet on the stop after several days away from home.",
