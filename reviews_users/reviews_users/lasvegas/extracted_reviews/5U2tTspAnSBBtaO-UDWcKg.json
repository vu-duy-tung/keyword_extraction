We ordered the Poutine Waffles and Arugula with poached egg. However, after being advised that the food would take 30 min or so because it would be \"prepared fresh\" and waiting with high expectations. My bf and I could barely enjoy our food because of the overpowering amounts of salt. Again the service and overall ambiance are amazing. Might go back for a Mimosa brunch with the ladies but definitely wont be back to eat.",

The person who seated us said the waitress will be at our table shortly. We sat there and watch person after person pass us by. I finally said something after 15 minutes of waiting at our table for someone to  possible get us some drinks. I practically had to yell our our drink orders (mind you it was only water) just so she could hear me. She finally comes back and puts the drinks on the table and literally threw our utensils on the table and walked away without even asking if we were ready to order. So once again here we are waiting to order. I looked at my girlfriend and finally said we are getting the hell out of here. I walked up to the hostess, told her where we were sitting explained that we just ordered water and we are leaving. She looked at me with a disgusted look and said \"well what do you want me to do about it\"? It took me everything to not explode in her face. Who in their right mind says that to a customer. I will never go back to this place. We ended up going to Sunrise Cafe.",

In the beginning their online wait list seemed to work great, now I'm still waiting to receive a notification from almost a month ago. I figured I would give it another try since the first 3 times I used it, it worked great. Unfortunately again it's failed me. I called and spoke with one of the hostesses who agreed that it's definitely faulty but the best advice would be to put the name on the wait list then show up because if you're \"in front of us, we will seat you.\" Well that's disappointing to hear since I'm waiting to get my 10 minute warning text, like I'm sure most other people that read the website is as well. So basically all the people that do that, even being after me on the wait list, are getting seated for being there, it's frustrating and disappointing to know. While the food is good, I can honestly say Craft Kitchen, which is literally less than a mile away, has a way better wait list system and the food is equally as good. I would suggest going there instead.",

Unfortunately I went for brunch today and found the service to not be the best. Everything took a very long time. My coffee finally came out when my cousins were almost finished their specialty hot chocolates, and the server had me set a timer to press the French Press at the right time. Then even after I pressed it I had to request creamer and sugars and then remind the server again to bring them. The table was never bussed throughout, so appetizer plates were left filling the table as we ate. No one checked on us during the meal, and even after. We sat for a while with our plates and had to request someone bring a box and the check instead of the server coming by. I understand brunch is usually very busy and I'm not one to complain much, but the service unfortunately lacked. I hope if I try it out again it'll be better!",

However no one came to our table until my fiance asked the busboy at another to table if we can get a server. I wouldn't have asked and just waited for the server.

We enjoyed the atmosphere so much that having to wait almost an hour to get our food was forgotten.

There were a few things that were not to our taste ( The deviled eggs for example, the egg yolk is not mixed in with the other ingredients to create a smooth filling it's more like a hard-boiled egg with a topping. I'm just not a fan of hard-boiled egg yolk) but the PB&J egg biscuit is everything! I did go on a Monday so it was not crazy busy like it may be on a weekend.

I come to find out it that it was a complicated process to book a large party on a Sunday but we let that go because we were excited! When we got inside, 2 friends slipped on the floor and almost knocked themselves out but we laughed about that and continued on. The service was slow, food was good (once we got it) but our waitress was seemingly annoyed and unhappy with her job so we felt it throughout the 2 hours. We tried to disregard (for BDAY purposes) her demeanor, but it got hard to ignore and when we paid 21% gratuity for our bill - it seemed VERY hard to stomach....but we did. We never asked to speak to management but we weren't coming back. THEN a girl (who did NOT give us any impression she was management...no professional attire or name tag etc etc) came over and ASKED US how our meal was so we told her... it was the truth and hard to hear but I was impressed that they came over to get that \"feedback\". This \"manager\" told us they brought in 4 people to help work that day (that didnt normally work there) and that OUR server had many complaints against her. They apologized MULTIPLE times and gave us coupons to come back and try again. I was willing to do so. Then ...right before we left, a man with a dirty apron on (I come to find is the chef/owner) walks over, leans over us on table and says that he has complaints against us and we are cursing at his staff and we need to leave. We are perplexed. We apologize to the 2 tables around us (just in case we were too loud)...who proceed to HUG US and take photos with us outside (I have proof in my phone) and say that THEY DID NOT COMPLAIN, and that is that. My bday friend asks hostess who the man was that asked us to leave...he is owner. She leaves and then got called twice by management saying they are pressing charges against my bday friend. The management said they called the POLICE and had someone later call and impersonate the police! No \"physical altercation\" ever ensued. Our friend and LV lawyer was a guest at the restaurant and with us in the car and laughed at this, but it is still not okay for a business to behave this way. It's become a crazy bullying fiasco. We wouldnt have EVER come back (due to bad service) but now I look at this place as a NIGHTMARE! Dont trust a place that will walk over and ask for your feedback and then string you up for it. Why are they so defensive?! Think about it. Use your best judgement.",

They didn't have anymore sugar in the raw... we had the last 4 packs... coffee wasn't hot at all.  We ordered the cowboy nachos to start... really weird combination. Didn't have onions like it listed... good sauce... but don't recommend.  Our entrees literally took 45 minutes and I believe it was because the chef took our food to the wrong table. I'm guessing who was \"VIP\" because they were giving that table a lot of love -- which btw came in 15 min after us and got their food before us...   So I'm guessing the chef had to remake our entrees because our plates were put down on the wrong table... at this point I didn't care for them to remake the entrees. We've waited soooooooo long!  I don't think we'll be coming back... especially for the price we paid wasn't worth the service & the wait.",

We smelled a fishy smell when we walked in but assumed it was the seafood they use. Not sure if it was cross-contamination or what but needless to say I will it be returning.    Also the service was atrocious. Marco asked if had ever been there before and we said no.  I'd assume he would then explain the menu or recommend something. Nope. Just took our order didn't even ask if our toddler wanted to eat.  We had to stop him and order scrambled eggs and sausage.     Of course it took 40 minutes for the food to come out and guess who's food took an extra 5 minutes.  You guessed it the scrambled eggs and one sausage link for my son. I could have made that in 4 minutes.  No wonder the table beside us immediately took their food to go as soon as it was brought to the table.    Then after my fiance took my son to the car, the plates were cleared from the table, and I sat there for another 8-10 minutes, Marco finally asked if I wanted my bill. No moron I'm just sitting here by myself for no reason at all.  Again since we'd never been there I didn't know if I was supposed to go up front or wait for him.    The end result is even if I didn't get sick eating their food the service would warrant never returning.    Go to Craft Kitchen up the road if you're looking for this type of food.  Better coffee, similar food, much better service, and of course no ramped vomiting and diarrhea.",

    "text": "I rarely leave reviews this low, but I went one other time thinking the first time was just a bad day.  It also feels weird because everyone has left such glowing reviews.  It's a long one...  1st visit: This was a few months ago, but we arrived around 9:30a.m on a Saturday expecting the rumored 1.5/2hr wait, but it must have been some a holiday weekend or something because it was dead, so we were excited to sit right down.  There must have been maybe four other tables in the restaurant.    No issues with the server thus far.  He was prompt and polite.  We ordered coffee and the grilled biscuit and jam.  The coffee was VERY good and the biscuit was NOT very good.  It honestly tasted like a stale biscuit warmed up, dry, crumbly and bland.   We ordered the Bangers & Eggs and Croque Madame.  While waiting for our food we see the whole front-of-house staff, including the chef, come out to do what you could basically call a \"pre-shift\" and stood around the service table tasting and discussing a dish.  What do you think happened?  Yup, our food stood in the window the entire time.  When our food arrived is obviously slightly warm instead of hot.  The banger dish was ok, but what are you to expect from bangers and eggs? The Croque Madame tasted like it would have been good if it was hot.  Croque Madame comes with a bechamel sauce which doesn't do good things as it cools.  We were honestly too aggravated to complain and just wanted to leave.  This was an avoidable issue which IMO makes it worse than just some food coming out wrong or waiting a little long.      While I can't completely blame the server, he should have been aware and the chef should know he has food being prepared.    2nd Visit: About two weeks ago we decided to go back.  Every restaurant has an off-day and everyone still raved about this place, so we said let's do it.   We waited a little over an hour, which is fine as we expected it, so I'm not factoring that in to my rating.    Things were seemingly on the up and up, the coffee was great like last time.  Our server was awesome.  I wish I remembered her name, because the owner should be happy he has someone like her.  She was a tall brunette with glasses.  We asked to start with the french toast and for the mains we were going to share the Country Fried and this Indian style chicken sandwich.    The french toast came promptly and it was good.  I'd say a 3.5 on a sale to 5.  We were feeling good about our experience thus far, but as the first  45 minutes passed by we started to get aggravated.  Our server brought us a savory pastry because we were waiting so long, so she allayed our frustration for the moment, but as another 40 minutes passed I got up and was going to ask for the bill so we can leave.  Nearly an hour and a half? Unacceptable.    The food was OK.  The country fried was solid and the biscuit was warm fluffy and delicious which only reinforced the one I got the last time was a stale one they warmed up.  The chicken sandwich was pretty solid as well.   Again, the server was great and comped half of our check, and I promise we still tipped on full price; she deserved it.  As someone who used to be a server I know this doesn't fall on her.  She told us there was a 30 person party, but again, coming from the industry that's no excuse.  When you have a party of that size you plan for it and around it.       All-in-all we will never be back.  Henderson is booming with breakfast/brunch places, so while the food was good on the second visit it simply isn't good enough to justify the wait or the experience.  Yes, it's a cute place with a great atmosphere, but that only goes so far.    The competition is growing and with established breakfast places like Served, Kitchen Table or Weiss's Deli, there are simply better options for the half the hassle.",

    "text": "The food is so good, I wanted to eat it twice.  Luckily, there was so much of it that I got to take half my delicious fried chicken sandwich with me. My honey looooves breakfast, but I like lunch, so I am always looking for places that serve both at once.  The Stove had the diverse menu and hours to please both of us.  The menu items looked like very creative twists on old favorites, which is always a good formula for a menu. I definately agree with other Yelpers who have written that there is some kind of disconnect between the front of the house and the kitchen.  We got on the online wait list, but later learned that it expires every fifteen minutes.  The hostess was dismissive and did seem overwhelmed by the volume of customers.  We were preemptorily shuttled to a side room to wait in a private event room, with others.  We were called in order, but it took about 20 minutes.  Next time we decided to arrive early.  It is also mysterious that half the restaurant is closed during the breakfast hours, with many vacant tables in view for people ordering tea service, which starts at 3pm.   The waiter also seemed rushed, but was helpful in chosing the dishes.  I ordered a Mimosa made of champagne and peach puree, which was kind of like a healthfood Bellini (in a good way). Unlimited Mimosas are available for a reasonable fee ($17.00).  This is Vegas, after all. The food was worth waiting for.  My husband's traditional Eggs Benedict were perfectly cooked and the sauce was creamy and lightly flavored with lemon.  His hashbrowns were sumptuously seasoned, and the muffins just browned.  My Indian spiced fried chicken sandwich with carmelized onions was spicy-yummy.  The fries crisply tasty, and a simple side salad had a vinagette dressing that tasted home made.  The dishes were hearty and tasty, everything you want in a breakfasty lunch.   We will be returning to The Stove with high expectations, but at an earlier, less crowded hour.",

This restaurant was cute and had a fresh, clean aesthetic. However the hostess service leaves a lot to be desired...I put my name on the waitlist online around 12:30ish and we didn't get seated till around 2. We had gotten there pretty early so we decided to sit outside in their patio area since it was a nice day. I kept refreshing my name on the list to keep track of my spot. After continuously refreshing the page, I saw my name off the list...no name call or text. We went inside to let the girl know and she put us back on the list only to wait another 30 minutes for a seat. Once we were seated, the waitress told us it would be another half hour to make food since it was made to order. Cute place and decent food but not worth that ridiculous wait.   + 1 (food) + 1 (ambiance) + 1 (waitress)",

We ordered the deviled eggs and were served hard boiled eggs cut in half with mayo on top. Not sure if they were going for a \"deconstructed\" dish or just got lazy but it did not taste or look good. Regardless, it was not deviled eggs. My pork eggs benedict was cold and the biscuit was hard and anything but flaky...Exactly what I expected after seeing it sit in the window for 6 minutes (yes I counted).   Maybe it was an off day but I would not go back because of the service.",

    "text": "The Stove is new, so I want to give them the benefit of the doubt (with an extra star) and hope the handful of issues I experienced were due to still working out the kinks.   We went for Sunday breakfast and I would imagine I'll be back again to see if they have improved, but I'll definitely give it a couple months. If I do, hopefully this review improves.   My first pet peeve was inconsistent and inaccurate menus. I really hope (and assume) they are temporary because they are cheaply printed on standard copy paper. I was told some pastry items (like the $7 donut) weren't available anymore because they \"didn't work out\", but then the server said they did have a donut; however, he was unable to actually describe the type of donut beyond it having classic glaze.   Despite my issues with the menu presentation/info, there are some very creative dishes for both breakfast and lunch; there's a whole section devoted to benedicts with properly poached eggs! (It's been my experience that LV chefs/line cooks have a hard time with poached eggs if they're even on the menu).   I did the suckling pig benedict; it was good, with potential to be great. First of all, after already dealing with inordinately long wait times for our food, I watched my benedict sit in the window under a lamp for several minutes while it waited for a waffle. As a result, a decent portion of the hollandaise sauce had cooked and was now scrambled eggs. I addressed it immediately with the expeditor and he said \"I'm sorry, would you like me to make you another one?\" ... No, definitely not, especially when I waited 20+ mins for this one!! Why he didn't offer to bring me fresh hollandaise, who knows?? Secondly, the dish is accompanied by a mixed greens side salad. I received a (warm), wilted, soggy, over dressed pile of greens that would have been a welcomed relief to the richness of eggs benedict. Unfortunately, it was inedible.   Taylor tried the churro waffle. Also good with the potential for greatness. The portion was two medium sized waffles so plenty of food, but the waffles weren't even slightly crispy, not even close..I've had more structured frozen waffles. While it's not great and of itself, when topped with macerated berries, whipped cream, and a syrup/glaze the waffles lost all integrity and were mush. The churro waffle didn't need too much assistance from regular syrup, but they do have vanilla bean and bourbon maple syrups to choose from and they were pretty incredible!   Lastly, there's the dining room. Following suit with the majority of local restaurants, table arrangements are cramped and crowded with terrible building acoustics, so it's annoyingly loud. There's a spacious bar area and two semi-private dining areas, but the main floor is a zoo. As we were leaving, a band was setting up, I couldn't believe it! Definitely not what I associate with a relaxed Sunday morning. If that band had started before I received my meal, I would have asked for a manager and subsequently left.",

The staff was friendly, especially our waiter Tony. He was very genuine, hardworking and gave us great food recommendations! My boyfriend ordered a peach mimosa with the honey toast, while I had the chiliquiles. Both were very delicious and definitely didn't disappoint.

Love the selection of teas. Also riddle me this: Who in Henderson offers a proper afternoon tea? This place does! Can't wait to try it.   Killer location. The view is lovely. The decor is charming. Very French Nouveau-Provence crossed with casual California.   Great service. You know that everything is made from scratch and that takes time. And yes.....that means please don't expect to be in and out of this restaurant in less than an hour. It's not going to happen and there's no problem with that. Plan accordingly.   People say that this location is jinxed and the turnover of restaurants in this building proves it. I give a firm no to that. Here's my reasoning:   If the service and especially the food quality keep themselves at the highest standard and something new and different is being offered that no one else offers, I don't think that people will stay away. Support your local charming and adorable new restaurant.",

    "text": "This morning, we came here without a reservation and were able to get sat pretty much right away which was nice. However when we sat down it took our sever about 5-7 min to come over to us and the table next to us. It wasn't busy so this was a slightly longer than average wait time to be greeted, we had enough time to look at the menus and decide what we were eating. The server came over, we ordered 2 waters, one hot tea, one cappuccino and one OJ, and our breakfast dishes. After 12 min of waiting the OJ and tea come out and she says \"the cappuccino will be right out\" (mind you we still haven't gotten any water) ... after waiting for about 5 more minutes my boyfriend gets up and asks a server to give us some water, and 5 minutes after that the cappuccino comes out, it took an extremely long time. When she dropped it to the table she did not bring any mixing spoons or sugar which is usually standard for most places. We asked for sugar and and spoon and only got sugar, the table next to us experienced the same exact thing and we both used our forks to mix out cappuccinos, after being here for 30 min our food came out, I asked for ketchup and never received it. Also the table next to us had ordered a cinnamon bun as a starter and they ended up getting their dishes the same time as us without ever receiving the cinnamon bun. The food quality is ok but the service here is EXTREMELY slow and the staff does not be seemed to properly apprehend a guests needs which makes a dining experience pretty crappy!",

Ok, you have a bar, oh so nice to SAY something. We ordered mimosas and that took another 20 mins. 11:50 oh drinks. We were finally seated at 1:15. Now please imagine this wait with a 3 year old. Thank God her Mom brought snacks. Little bit did really well and was such a trooper. Ok, now we are finally seated and our waitress informed us that it will be another 45 minutes to an hour plus for our order to go even go through. I asked if they could at least make the single pancake for our 3 year old and we could wait for our bacon, eggs and toast. Yeah, she said no. My friend asked why wasn't this disclosed that we would have to wait over 3 hours to be served food when you knew we had a kid with us and there was the blame \"oh she, the hostess must not have known how busy we were and we do have two big parties. I guess if you're that stupid you must think everyone else is that stupid to let such stupidity come out of your mouth.  I don't think our service could have been more lackadaisical and inconsiderate. Just be honest from the start like at least at the end when a single pancake for a hungry 3 year old was too much for you guys to handle. You just made a 3 year old cry because we had to leave without food after two f*cking hours!!!.. I F*cking Hate this place.",

The Stove has a dining room for seated service and a tea room. The entire restaurant is surrounded by windows making it a bright, open space.   The Mexican Egg, a Mexican twist on a Scottish Style Egg was very good. The egg was perfectly cooked and the flavors were excellent. The potatoes under the egg were notably delicious. The Blueberry Muffin was moist and delicious.   The Muffalata Sandwich didn't look exciting, but packed a ton of flavor and heat. The Indian Sandwich was unique and delicious. The chicken was juicy and well seasoned. Both of these had a nice combination of flavors that I enjoyed. The Poutine Waffle was both yummy and unique in presentation. It wasn't served on top of a waffle, but with pieces of waffle mixed in with the poutine.   I loved the atmosphere and the food items I've tried so I'll definitely return. The tea area looked like a fun space to relax with a friend too.",

    "text": "The Stove is easily the most anticipated restaurant opening in Henderson, featuring the partnership of Antonio Nunez and Scott Commings with an expansive menu of innovative breakfast, lunch, and brunch dishes, in addition to a tea lounge and a decadent selection of pastries. The space itself is as well thought-out as the menu, with a table honoring the previous incarnation as a Kerry Simon restaurant to the vertical gardens for fresh garnishes and the reservable meeting spaces in back, not to mention a selfie booth to further push their social media advertising campaign. The staff at the Stove have put out beautiful, delicious dishes accompanied by attentive and personable service across three visits in the past month- once for pastries, again for breakfast, then for a birthday brunch.   Favorite dishes include the Maharaja fried chicken sandwich (conceived by another favorite local chef, Hemant Kishore), the Suckling Pig Benedict (sweet, savory, salty- it's got everything!), and the Pecan Pie Pancakes (go big or go home). Brunch fanatics burned out on the same basic dishes across town will be intrigued by the Mexican Egg, Poutine Waffle, and a super-spicy Muffalata sandwich. If you only have time to grab and go, anything warm with fresh blueberries will absolutely make your day, and I highly suggest pairing it with a super-strong (both in flavor and caffeine) iced lavender coffee.   If the dish names, descriptions, and photos aren't enough to lure you in, I'm happy to keep coming back for more myself. Despite the trek clear across town, I find myself suggesting this spot for a meetup every couple of weeks. Next visit, I plan to check out their afternoon tea!",

    "text": "Another breakfast/brunch spot in Henderson and it's mighty good.  Four of us had brunch here last Saturday.  It's rare that when we order so many different items that they'd all be spectacular but that's the case here.  Each one was as good as the previous item.  We started with some pastries.  This isn't something I'd order but there were four of us and we split everything.  The Madeleines were standouts.  Next came the PB&J egg biscuit with a fried egg, peanut butter mousse, bacon jam, and jalapenos.  We were then brought a vegan chocolate chip cookie to see how good that tasted.  Great!  Next up was deep fried bacon--thick cut Applewood smoked bacon with maple dipping sauce.  The maple dipping sauce has a tang that takes a bit to reveal itself on the palette but then stays for a while.    Next up were the brie pancakes--with the wonderful pancakes topped with melted brie, apples, and lemon zest.  One might not think the brie would work but it does.  Then came the Monte Cristo--brioche filled with country ham, swiss cheese, and fried in pancake batter, served with house jam.   Next up was my favorite dish of the brunch and I ate way too much of it and it still wasn't all finished--the Poutine waffle with cheese curds, French fries, gravy, caramelized onions, smoked pork, and scallions.  This is the only way to eat waffles--with gravy on fries with cheese curds and chunks of waffle throughout.  Not exactly Canadian but perhaps better!  Eh?  Next was a dish called Foie and Cherries--amaretto french toast, red wine soaked cherries, toasted almonds, and orange zest.  Excellent flavor to the wine soaked cherries and the foie was outstanding.  I don't generally order French toast but if I were going to, it would be this!  Naturally, we had to have some kind of dessert to finish the brunch items and we got a Mexican ice cream--fried house made ice cream, churro waffle, dulce de leche, orange zest, and cinnamon sugar.  As I said at the start, any dish is excellent.  However, my recommendation would be to skip the pastries and go straight to the poutine.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place because it is SUCH a cool, and unique restaurant in the heart of a Henderson. They really spared no expense with the decor, and it looks like a restaurant you would find elsewhere. They even have a patio with fire pit, photo booth, and a tea room!!   We were lucky to have reservations for our large party for Sunday brunch, and were seated in the tea room. Others that came through the door without a reservation were told a 1.5-2 hour wait (holy!) The tea room is BEAUTIFUL and such a cool place to have a private event.   The menu is sizable and even though they have a handful of vegan options, it is very meat heavy (lots of dishes with chorizo and pork). They must not have a regular liquor license as all the cocktails are made with sake. I would've had a mimosa but felt the prices to be a bit steep for drinks. I do like that they have a proper espresso menu which is always a bonus in my book for breakfast/brunch places.  Now for the food, it was really just meh. We had a party of 10 and 2 really disliked their food (orders wrong or poorly cooked and even had them fix the items to no success), 2 really liked their food, and the rest just said everything was executed so-so. I went with the avocado toast and it was something I could've made (better) at home. The toast was super thin, the avocado was mushy like guacamole, and it just wasn't worth the $11.  I would like to give this place another chance once they get up and running properly (it is still a very NEW restaurant) but I won't be rushing back in the near future.",

    "text": "Prior to  coming to the stove again I wanted to plan for a high tea party with my friends for our January birthdays since they take reservations and I did their High Tea before in  their twisted tea room. ( this is where it got frusturating and confusing) So about a week and half ago I called asking to make reservations for their twisted tea room. I was told they don't do the High tea anymore because their was not enough demand for it. Understandable.  So I was redirected to a group sales coordinator Alisa (702) 499-2552 to make general reservations and she told me it was only for 8 or more. Ok...since I had a part of 6 will just be there since its a first come first serve. Told everyone to meet up at 10:00 am. Waited about 10 minutes. Ok. not bad. Our waiter, Alec tend to us.   So I vented to our waiter about my experience prior communicating about getting rid of the high tea. All of a sudden I am hearing new information that its 10 or more people to do the high tea????? So is the stove doing a high tea? and what are the limitations? where is the direction of the restaurant going? hmm. Our waiter said he will confirm with management but never clarified.   Moving  forward, I ordered a bunch of items on the menu. To Drink I ordered the cappuccino and their famous Unicorn Hot Chocolate. Super Sweet. Butternut squash ravioli. Very good. I did not care for the toast and over-easy egg. Butternut Squash ravioli should speak for itself. Then I ordered the Matcha French toast. Love how its not too sweet. But too much toast. Our server can sharpen his Anticipatory guest service skills. I asked for my water to be refilled but did not refill our waters at all. Over, all service was OK. It can be improved.  Leaving the restaurant my friend saw photo booth which I did not see the first time I was there. Little highlight.  Overall, I really don't know if I am coming back. Its one of those experience that  I did not gravitate. hmmm.",

This place definitely has an Instagram-worthy atmosphere and nice ambiance, with a beautiful view of the Strip. I wish it were open at night because I think it would make a nice happy hour spot. This place seems like a perfect place to book private events. I love that they have a vegan menu for my vegan friends and would only recommend that they add a dairy-free pancake option or consider a vegan chik'n and waffles (both kids and adults would go crazy for this, it's easy, and there's only a few places in town that offer it). My waiter was super friendly and since a few of the menu offerings weren't available, my friend and I surprisingly got a discount on our bill. They also asked for our feedback at the end of our meal, so this is a place that definitely cares about their consumers. I'm interested to try their afternoon tea. Hopefully they have a vegetarian afternoon tea option. Thanks for a nice birthday brunch experience the Stove!",

We had a party of 4 and 3 of our dishes came out but the other person in our party had to wait 20 minutes for it to be served. We had all finished eating by the time he had gotten his plate.  Our waitress wasn't very attentive but they were super slammed for brunch. I might give this another shot once they are more established and on the ground running!  Overall cute atmosphere, great view, great front service hostesses, and I love that you can see behind the scenes into the kitchen of what's going on!",

Looks like I'm sticking to squeeze in from here on here  We went to your location yesterday the 7th, wasn't aware they moved the date of the 4th of July. Also your employee is the one who informed us they closed early due to no one coming in for the past couple hours.",

    "text": "I was here for a birthday brunch for two of my coworkers - and what a surprise this place was.  Entering in I can hear the clinking of silver ware & the bellows of the patrons enjoying their meals as the food aroma hits me.   There's a very eclectic decor that is keeping my eyes busy as I wander around to find my friends.  The smiles of the wait staff is friendly and genuine and our champagne bottles are already open and ready for mixing with an assortment of fresh fruit juices: mango, orange, blackberry, & hibiscus.  Mango and hibiscus ended up being my favorite.  The food menu selection is just as eclectic as the vibe of the restaurant. I felt like it was a \"stick to your ribs\", country home style  cooking with with a bit of poshness mixed in from caviar topped deviled eggs with Parmesan truffle shavings to deep fried Fois Gras in waffles.  It was our first time here so we decided to try each other's plates and some of my favorites are: short rib empanadas, the butternut squash raviolis, and of course the Fois gras.  Mixing your own mimosas will be a challenge - we've had to order another round of napkins because of our clumsiness.   This is the perfect place for brunch, the food portions are appropriate and the staff is friendly.  I will be back again.  Cheers  :)",

    "text": "Walked out.  Waited more than 30 minutes to get a matcha tea and after an hour of waiting for our food (which probably shouldn't have taken more than 7 minutes to cook), we walked out.    First, let me start by saying that it is highly likely that the terrible experience we had at The Stove was largely due to our server.  While he was initially timely in greeting us and taking our drink order (my wife had a coffee, I ordered a matcha tea), it took more than 15 minutes for my wife to receive her coffee (which tasted burned).  I never received my tea.  After 30 minutes, I asked the server about it and he said that they were just preparing it.  I mean, seriously, matcha tea is just powder and hot water.  Either way, I cancelled the order.  Thereafter, we never received any updates about our food or had any return service from the server other than a visit to our table 15 minutes later to tell us that our food was \"three tickets\" away from being fired.  20 minutes later, we decided to walk out.    As to our orders, I ordered the squished eggs and my wife ordered the egg tacos.  Seriously, these orders shouldn't have taken more than three minutes to cook, but we understand that there was a large crowd, so the ticket times would be a bit longer.  However, more than an hour?!?  I understand that this was largely likely an issue related to our server.  We saw a table that was sat 30 minutes after us receive their food after waiting about 20 minutes.  Generally, if a restaurant is in the weeds and running long ticket tickets, they have servers pass out small bites to patrons. For example, Sunrise Cafe passes out its grilled muffins, which is a nice treat. Given the issue with the tea, I do not think that the server put in the order.  Either way, the server reflects on the restaurant and this review.  On the bright side, after I informed the hostess that we were walking out and I wanted to pay for the coffee, they informed the server and the expo (likely the owner or executive chef) that we had the issue.  Apparently the food was ready and in the window.  We were going to refuse the food, but the server was insistent that we at least get to try the food despite the long wait.  The server packed up the food and bagged it for us to take out.    In terms of the actual food, it does taste damn good.  The price point of this restaurant is very attractive given the overpriced food at Craft Kitchen and the pricey brunch places like Jardin or Bouchon on the strip.  As to the tacos, they are basically Mexican street tacos with soft scrambled eggs and pickled red onion.  This dish should literally take like two minutes to make (the scramble was not the Gordon Ramsey scramble that would take much longer).  As for the squished eggs, it was quite delicious.  However, it's a two minute dish.    As noted, the server was likely the largest issue here.  I did see people walk out who enjoyed their meals.  The women sitting next to us did not seem to enjoy how long it took for them to receive their bill and then how long it took to run their check, but that was likely a server issue again.  The decor of the restaurant is nice, but FireFly should get the most credit for that.  After FireFly, a dinner place was in this location.  From what I saw, most of the TI was already in place from those two entities.    Either way, despite the food being quite good and the price point being extremely reasonably, we will not be coming back.  I can get better tacos at Las Cazuelas, go to Black Bear Diner or Egg Works for the usual breakfast fare, or any of the number of places around the valley that offers innovative \"upscale\" breakfast without having to wait more than 20 minutes to get a coffee, and almost 1.15 hours for the food.",

I ordered oatmeal and my husband ordered a burger. I saw several dishes sitting in the window for 15 mins or better waiting on the rest of the tables orders. I watched my oatmeal sit there forever waiting on my husband's portion. As you can imagine, it was like cement by that time. After waiting an hour for our food, I was not asking for a replacement. The kitchen has serious issues getting food out in a timely manner. No one is moving with any sense of urgency. We have a breakfast date every Fri and we were looking for a few different places to try. We will never come back here. Never!",

    "text": "Upfront: Food was pretty good; service was AWFUL.   Details: plan for an extremely excessive wait. We put our names on the wait list with a \"1 to 1:15 hour wait\" and were seated after two hours. In the interim we tried to get a drink at the bar and simply couldn't - it was like being invisible. During this ordeal we were treated to the sounds of a member of the wait staff losing his damn mind about \"how I can't deal with this anymore, this is f***ing bulls***\" etc etc....  When we were finally seated no one came to take our order for 20 minutes. But someone did show up to slop a little water into our glasses and slam them onto the table of for us. He graced us with an eyeroll when we told him we didn't need one of said water glasses filled. That was top notch.   After our server finally showed up things got better. We put our whole order in at once because we were famished, but more importantly didn't want to risk another 20 minute interlude before seeing our server again. She was great by the way, but she never did ask us if we wanted to order follow up drinks. At brunch.   When the food showed up, it was about as advertised - delicious. However the chorizo on the \"Mexican Egg\" I ordered was not cooked. To be clear, it wasn't \"undercooked\", the entire inside was truly raw. Yum. Otherwise though, all the other dishes were good.   Bottom line, if you can get in the door without an absurd wait, and you didn't have to drive across town to try the place, the food is worth it. But if you check and find the wait is around an hour - just go to Eat downtown. The food is better, the service is excellent, and the people are happy.   Note to Management: fix your life. 1) do something about either your wait times (see next fix), or the math you're doing to give your estimated wait times. Preferably both. 2) you have an incredible amount of wasted space (potential seating, ie less wait time) in front of the serving counter which you are using as a finishing table for dishes, which your SERVERS ARE FINISHING! You are probably the only restaurant I've ever been to where a dish leaves the kitchen without being finished. And definitely the only restaurant that wastes 25 sq ft of dining space to do it. You are also storing a Mac book on said table. Must be the off-hours office? 3) general tidiness - the first thing I saw walking up to your place was the \"mimosa garden\" which still had an \"under construction\" sign...but was littered with empty plastic cups and champagne bottles. Classy.  Start prioritizing your customer experience over whatever dumb crap you're currently prioritizing.",

    "text": "Wonderful decor with a great view of Las Vegas (if you get the right seats).  Reasonably priced and a creative menu.  Comfortable seating arrangements.  Four of us visited on a Tuesday morning, so we were seated promptly. We ordered some pretty simple dishes: Grilled cheese with tomato soup, a traditional two-egg breakfast, waffle and chicken and a bowl of oatmeal.  Our server was mechanically effective, but didn't seem interested in building rapport with customers. In fact, every employee looked as though they were engaged in forced labor. There was no warmth.  Considering the restaurant was one-third full, the kitchen was slow.  We could see the waffle/chicken sitting on the cooks' window for a while before anything else came out.  Three of us were served together, but some of the food was lukewarm.  The last person to eat? Oatmeal. Yes, a bowl of oatmeal arrived several minutes after everyone else's dish.  Unless someone in my group insists, I don't foresee going back.  Too many other great places to have breakfast. One of my favorites is Rise and Shine in Southern Highlands, Bacon N Truffles at Eastern and Pebble is good, too. I think this restaurant is in the \"new and shiny\" category and the proximity to Anthem puts it adjacent to a lot of consumers who have limited neighborhood choices, thus the crowds.",

It was probably a 10 minute wait and that was because we had 5 people in our party this time.   The stove has a super comfortable feel and a great menu. I would definitely go back to try more things.   The reason I have it a 4 instead of a 5 is because when we asked how much a bottle of champagne was we were told $18 and when we got our bill it ended up being $22. Another reason is because it is a bit pricey.",

    "text": "This review is based on 3 visits to The Stove. The first visit was quite pleasant. My companion and I were the first arrivals of the early morning so we got the full attention of the staff. Initially I was wowed by the cute decor, unique location, and delicious food. It was a great experience all around. I told everyone about it and vowed to return.   My next visit was mid morning on a Saturday with one friend. I signed into the waitlist online and when we arrived they sat us pretty quickly. But it went downhill from there. We were ignored for about 15 min even though only half the tables were full, in a small restaurant. There seemed to be only 2 servers? We ordered quickly, but waited about an hour to get our food. Our beverages were never refilled, and the waiter didn't even check back to let us know things were backed up in the kitchen etc. the food was pretty good, although mildly overpriced. I gave them the benefit of the doubt thinking it was just a bad day.   My third visit was last Saturday and it will be my last. Again I signed in 20 min before arriving, and when we got there it again looked half empty. Yet they had us wait for almost 10 min. After sitting, my mother and I sat for another 10 min before I had to flag the hostess down to fill our water glasses. She asked if the server had been by, and I said no. Another five min later the server came and took our order. We waited AN HOUR. For breakfast. I have worked in food service and never in my life have I waited even 45 min for a breakfast meal - even in a jam packed restaurant - and this place had many open tables. After an hour I was getting antsy, as the server had not checked in with us ONE time or filled our glasses. I had to flag her down and kindly ask what was taking so long. She said it should be out in a few min. Another 10 min passed before we got our food. Overall the whole experience took nearly 2 hours which is just incredibly mind boggling considering how small the place is.   Additionally, we were sitting right next to the table where an employee was putting finishing touches on the food. He wasn't wearing gloves, we never saw him wash his hands, and on more than one occasion saw him swiping his nose and sweat with his hands.  While the food may be tasty, I feel that this place does not live up to the expectation. Terrible service kills any positive vibes it has going for it.",

    "text": "Has so much potential but lord help you if you are expecting quick service and tasty food  We were excited to try the The Stove and put our party of 4 on the call ahead listed for a Saturday morning. We had a REALLY hard time finding the place as the signage is tiny and unreadable. The parking lot is also insane with dead ends and not a lot of options.  Once we made our way up the restaurant, we waited about 15 minutes for a table. The waiting area is terribly small and you end up feeling like you are intruding on the people seated at the tables next to you. It is not a pleasant way to start a meal.   When they went to seat us, they put our table of four at a two top table that they had shoved four seats at. The seats next to each other were literally touching and would have only worked for two small children, if that. When I pointed this out the hostess, she said that this was how they arranged the table with no indication that she found it unacceptable. We offered to turn the table diagonally so that it would work for four ADULTS and immediately what felt like the entire wait staff descended upon us to chastise us about how we were NOT allowed to shift the table. When I explained that there was no way four adults could sit at the table the way they set it up, they seemed to agree but said it was a fire hazard. It was then I realized that this was not their first rodeo with customers trying to sit comfortably at their impossible child table. We then were told if we wanted a different table (you know, one you could actually sit at) we would need to wait again. We should have left, but alas, we did not.   After finally being seated at a normal adult table, the experience continued on its downward trend. Service was absent, at best. The drink glasses are child sized and never refilled. The wait time was inexplicably long and the food was both bland as hell and way too spicy.   They are trying to be Craft Kitchen but fail at it spectacularly. And I have to agree with a fellow reviewer. I watched their expo guy using his bare hands to put garnish on. Not great.",

    "text": "An absolute cute and adorable restaurant.   We dined here for breakfast we saw it was new and we'd never been.   Service was impeccable thanks to Colin our server. He was an absolute delight and came to our rescue by recommending a few items from the menu when we were indecisive.   We ordered the following:   * .. Croquet Madame ( the best I've had is in a little French bakery down in Palms Springs- so when I find this item on the menu I have to give it a go ) - this was pretty tasty. I don't like runny eggs, but it was perfect. I can probably do without the salad they offer. Maybe some fruit or hash brown would go better. Lol   * ..  Poutine Breakfast - combo of waffles, French fries, pulled pork, cheese curds, and gravy sauce *eyes widen* I know! Very interesting dish at best. This was a recommendation by Colin. We gave it a try and were pretty impressed. Mixture of sweet (waffles with syrup) and savory (French fries and pulled pork) . Needed a bit of spice, but we got that squared away with the hot sauce options they offered.   Overall great place. Super cute, service was great and entrees were delicious!   * .. Chilaquiles with green sauce - a bit salty, but I think that's because the tortillas were chips and not actual cut up tortillas .. But still very flavorful   * Punkin Pancakes : Sweeeet, but sooooo good. I wanted to order an additional batch and take these home so I can enjoy them with a nice warm coffee all cuddled up on my couch.",

    "text": "Oh yeah, I definitely love this place. A lot of my reviews are 4 or 5 stars because I typically only write reviews for places I truly love. I really love The Stove, the combination of the delicious food and the cute atmosphere runs at exactly my speed. It should be a 5 star review for me, but let me explain later why I rate this place with only 4 stars.  I found The Stove while scrolling through my Instagram feed and seeing a friend of mine saying she was \"finally able to come here\". Here pictures were cute, so I decided to check them out on Yelp. Everything looked great! The Stove's like 40 minutes away from where I live, but I will definitely be making the trek back here regardless. I'm definitely excited to come back here and try other things they offer. They're definitely a step up from The Egg & I but more chill than Mon Ami Gabi. A good middle. If they had a more central location, surely I'd be back sooner.  They have a hydroponics station set up, which is totally cool. I didn't get a chance to go look at exactly what they were growing there. Perhaps some of the salad that came with my meal came from there.  They managed to take the second floor of a building with big windows that overlooks the Valley and it's gorgeous. The decor is fancy and you absolutely feel like your in \"The Brunch Scene\" surrounded by champagne flutes and fluffy pillows and fleur-de-lis wall paper. It's a beautiful thing. Colin was our server, and he's the right person for the job - he's really nice and talkative! He helped us figure out to order too, which was great. I think he directed us to the right dishes, which was good since they have a pretty big menu.   I came here with my brother for a very late lunch (around 4 pm) on a day that we were both randomly off. Apparently we missed the hoopla earlier that day because it was the first day of school and all the mothers came here after dropping off their kids to have a bit of fun. Haha, I can only imagine how exciting that would've been. We were here when things were winding down, near closing. There was only one other table occupied when we were there. They have a lot of tables! That's a good thing. Hopefully when it's busier, that means there is less of a wait? They also have a patio, which intrigues me, just not at quite this high of an outdoor temperature. No, thank you! I'll try again in the fall when it cools down.  I ordered the Crabby Patty Benedict. It came with the usual two halves of the English muffin, each with a poached egg, hollandaise sauce and nice, big chunks of crab on top. Then under those, there were about 4 tablespoons of seasoned potatoes. Next to the Benedict, there was a small salad. In terms of the taste, wow. Everything on the place was soooo good. I wish there were more of a description for what goes in each of those parts of the dish. The salad was light, but whatever dressing they used was really good, I'm not even sure how to begin describing it other than \"good\". The potatoes were BOMB. Very well seasoned - not plain at all. Their potatoes are not the usual house potatoes that i was expecting. They were not crispy, but instead mushy - and in a good way! Like the almost-mashed potato. Yum. The Benedict was of course the star of the dish. Real crab on top, the hollandaise was perfect and the egg was poached nice.   Here's where I determined The Stove to be 4 stars. Honestly, when my plate came to me, I was hesitant that it was going to be enough to fill me and my instincts were right. Though everything tasted marvelous, I hardly left feeling full. I totally cleaned that plate and for $16, it just could have filled me up more.  My brother had the berry waffles. They were really good! I had a bite and the maple syrup they serve with them was delicious.  I also got a mango mimosa, which I was totally stoked about and it was great! They had a lot of other champagne cocktails that also had my eye. Next time.  All in all, I love the look and feel and taste of the place, I just need bigger portions. Still coming back though!",

    "text": "This is for the tea room only. I want to start off by saying the manager fixed the situation by comping the meal, but I still want to write this review on what happened and what went wrong.  I want to express after the overall experience it seems the establishment would not be good for high tea and the employees don't seem to understand high tea. First off, the tea room is a room nicely decorated in part of the restaurant. But I don't think it will ever be good for high tea, or afternoon tea, because it's supposed to be a refined, relaxed affair that you take slow. People could disagree with me here of course; it's a matter of preference. The loudness of the restaurant made the environment feel rushed and stressed as I had trouble getting the server's attention when something was wrong since I was shouting and they couldn't hear me. You also have to almost yell to order your food.  Now to the mistakes. We got the $18 afternoon tea (\"FORMAL TEA\") so that's $18 per person. The food tier came out before the tea, when they said the tea comes first, then about 5 min later you get the tier. The server put the wrong tea cups on the wrong dish in front of us, which the boyfriend and I promptly switched the tea cups to the right plates. Still not sure if this was on purpose since it's a little \"mad tea\" in here. That's not a big deal. The tier was missing our cucumber sandwiches, which I had to point out. The crumpets were gross... doughy, undercooked in the middle and oddly slightly damp on the outside. We informed them the crumpets were doughy in the middle and were promptly brought out doughier crumpets. When I cut the crumpets in half the knife was doughy.  We asked why there wasn't clotted cream and they were out of it. They offered us jam and butter - yes, shouldn't this all be brought to the table? The jam and clotted cream were mentioned on the menu. It was odd we had to ask for these things, like they were extra. There was no sugar on the table at any point, and no spoons at our table to stir our tea. I stirred my tea with my fork, since I asked for almond milk. Isn't afternoon tea all about the experience? I'd like to have everything on the table to sort of look at and soak in while I enjoy my tea. They wouldn't bring us our teapots until they were done steeping, so we were forced to wait with our tier until we got them. Other tea places I've gone to have implanted little hourglasses that they leave on your table so you know when your tea is done. It seemed like they were determined to leave as little on our table or something.   Other issues: -they charged us $9 for a refill on our tea. $9. They also didn't tell us it wasn't unlimited. You charge me $9 for a refill, you better be telling us beforehand.  - we were expecting a discount at least, since everything seemed to be going wrong, we kept having to ask for things they forgot and were obviously disappointed. Instead they charged us $9 for a refill and full price on everything else. -manager was walking around asking if everybody was happy. This was only when we were able to voice all our concerns at once and get the meal comped. -Desserts seemed cheap and not thought out. One nice one on a display spoon and a Madeline cookie. Considering the other items you get, (crumpet, scone) why would I want more bready items. Give me a chocolate mousse, a petit four, tiramisu! Not a Madeline cookie.  -one tiny sandwich cube per person. (They forgot the cucumber ones, so at first we only got the Brie and marmalade) I'm talking like a tiny square piece. See photo. Very underwhelming and kind of felt skimped -nothing actually wow'd me, the cucumber sandwiches were gross because the bread they used was thick af and the cucumber slices were like they were trying to cut down on expensive cucumber (sarcasm here) -one tea menu on table but two regular menus for 2 people -VERY LOUD  The good: -they've got hats you can wear to look the part in this afternoon tea experience -one server was good, one was gone 3/4 of the time -very hipster. Servers wear suspenders and plaid shirts.  -nice choice of teas. Tea was good. Seemed knowledgeable about the tea -Loved decor, especially on the restaurant side. That part was packed.   Manager gave us something to take back so he would personally make our experience better next time.  Update since manager responded: I just want to make everyone aware that I've never been charged $60 a person for tea anywhere in Vegas. There's a place in China town that charges around the same as this one.  Also, we ordered what was called the \"formal tea\"  Twisted tea on their menu is when you can get alcohol instead of tea. So that's kind of confusing",

The menu is unique to say the least and very fresh. They even grow there own herbs, right next to the kitchen.  I have always wanted to try chilaqulies and they have that with there shredded pork and your choice of red or green sauce, i picked green. Kind-a disappointed, came out quite dry and hard to find the sauce, the pics i have seen have the sauce all over it, the pork was great, but the whole thing was very dry.  I do recommend The Stove and if your looking for a \"different\" style breakfast you won't be disappointed.   If you order what i had, ask for extra sauce.",

I read told that even though I had been on the wait list for an hour that it would still be another 40 min to an hour. SERIOUSLY???? 2 hour wait for food? I guarantee the people standing waiting were not waiting for that long. When I questioned the hostess I was told \"the wait is always that long. It doesn't matter if you put your name on the list\".

As for my *Chiliquilies good portion however, the chips were not just mushy but they were stale. I get it the Mole would make it wet but the parts that were dry was stale. The pork was dry and didn't have much flavor and there were loads of salt too salty for me and I enjoy my fair share of salt.  To make things worse it was luke warm more towards cold. I was sad. I love eating and I love putting amazing flavors into my mouth.  It wasn't worth the calories. I sooo wanted this place to be my new brunch spot.

However, I've always overlooked that because the decor and food was always great.   Today was a totally different experience. First I didn't go online and put my name on the wait list. Huge mistake! As a walk in we were put on the end of the list, were told it would be a 30 min wait. No biggie right?!? However, it took over an hour to get a table while all that time saw group after group walk right in and immediately sat down. I'm all for online check in, but when you have a paying customer live in your establishment you would think they would do something to honor your wait time.   Once we were seated my family ordered our meals right away (you know, since we had over an hour to look at the menu). My usual favorite \"Avocado Toast\" came out and was 1/2 the size it normally was, 2 out of the 3 pieces of toast were hard as a rock while the other was soft and barely toasted. My husband did not get the bacon that came with his meal, and when it finally arrived at the table was completely raw. My sons sausage was burnt to a crisp and barely edible.   We were sure to order one of their cinnamon rolls for a dessert and promptly asked for it to come out after our meals. I guess that was too much to ask since it never showed up.   I'm not sure if the place has just gone down hill since it opened, but I'm not sure I will be back. Which is very disappointing!",

My boyfriend and I almost walked out when our server, Rachel, threw my silverware onto the table in front of me. And the food? Zero flavor. Anyone who praises the food here must have grown up on fast food. What a waste of space this restaurant is.",

Came in on a Tuesday and got immediately seated. Service was slowwww. Took 10 minutes to be greeted and another 5 minutes for water to be poured. The server had disappeared for a bit and when we had asked about some questions about menu items, she wasn't very knowledgeable   Eventually we had ordered the Salmon Benny, Street Taco Benny and a cinnamon roll along with the focus juice and lavender iced coffee. Everything took an insane amount of time to come out and everything came out separately. Drinks were nothing special. Food was flavorful and tasty however they were both lukewarm when we had received it. Looking back at the line there were 3-4 expos/runners just chatting while the food got cold.   Working in a restaurant and seeing how this place ran service wise was infuriating. Not worth the price  to receive cold food and slow service.",

The bananas foster was flambeed table side! It was a great birthday show! Then we had the trio of bacon and sausages.   The presentation was sophisticated and you can see the strip (it's small) from the window views! Wanted to order everything! Made me think of Los Angeles or Palm Springs restaurants or Strip places.

Mexican egg - the egg was good, the potatoes underneath where the egg sat was blah. 3. Crabby Patty Benedict - first bite was good, the rest was uneventful. 4. Carbonara - salty.

    "text": "Very cute and quaint brunch spot. My friend and I came across an article discussing this fairly new restaurant in the valley. We saw they had bottomless mimosas and mimosa bongs and we were sold. The wait for two was 25-30 minutes. We had to of showed up right after the rush. There were only 2 parties ahead of us and they sat within a few minutes of our arrival.  The hostess wasn't very personable/talkative. We asked a few questions and got a pretty short and bland response for each. It wasn't very busy in the moment, we were the only ones waiting. Other than that, she got us seated within the quoted time and helped the server by starting our drink order.  Rachel was the sweetest. They were out of a few drinks and she was very apologetic when three of my friends choices were shot down. When faced with the hardest decision, what to eat, she was able to help us out with time to spare.  We decided on the bottomless mimosas, hibiscus and mango -- definitely the best appetizer on the menu -- and the BGR burger, add egg, side jalapeno bacon. If I could choose one thing in the world to eat every day of my life, it would be this burger. They offer their own hot sauce, add it to the ketchup, voila; you're welcome! I couldn't help but tell everyone about that burger and hot sauce for the following few hours; now I can't stop daydreaming about it. We will certainly be back soon!",

    "text": "Definitely a cute breakfast/brunch spot ---- Be aware that yes, it does get busy and expect to wait a bit to be seated. I do recommend putting your name on the list online while driving over (to save some wait time). Downfall is there's not much room to wait around either. Yes, it also gets loud but it's more so because there's a lot of workers and customers inside so what can a person expect?   Me and my friends went to the bar though to start bottomless mimosas so as long as there's an open bar and you're with good company, time passes quick. Our bartender served us 2 whole champagne bottles immediately and by the end of our 2 hours, we had tried all the mix ins/juices and there's none that I didn't like. Hibiscus and peach were the favorites though!  My friends and I ordered family style and shared a bunch of dishes: Mixed devil eggs, short rib empanadas, birthday pancakes, duck hash, suckling pig Benedict and poutine waffle. No complaints and happy with everything we ordered. The truffle deviled egg was split between 3 people and I wish I had one to my self ---- so rich and definitely memorable! Everything else was tasty and they weren't stingy with their meat dishes unlike other breakfast spots.  If the bottomless mimosas or yummy food doesn't attract you then maybe the friendly, prompt staff will. Unlike other restaurants where only one server is designated to certain tables, all Stove workers were sure to tend to our needs. Our waters were constantly filled and we were always asked if we needed anything. There was a small accident that happened during our visit (one that I will not say but nothing horrible -- it actually made everyone crack up, haha) but the staff went above and beyond to make it up to us when my friends and I laughed about it all and didn't mind. Head chef and owner brought us complimentary champagne flutes to end our meal and let's just say my friends and I all left happy, drunk and bloated from stuffing our mouths.   10/10 would recommend and will definitely come again when I'm back visiting Vegas!",

    "text": "For me, the service you receive is just as important as the food you eat. Our experience did not start off well. I added myself to the waitlist online before leaving the house. It only shows you the first 7 people so I called to see how long it would be and was told about 30 mins.   When we arrived at the Stove the hostess was looking down writing something for several minutes while we were standing there being ignored. A quick acknowledgement and hello would have been nice. I did really like the decor and atmosphere inside. Its really \"homey\" and warm feeling. Unfortunately I had lots of time to look at it as we sat there for quite a while waiting to be seated even with multiple open tables. This leads me to believe they were short servers or kitchen staff. Several tables remained open the entire time we were there even when the wait time was over an hour. The phone kept ringing and I think the hostess was just overwhelmed and needed some help up front.   Once seated our server Marco was over within a few minutes. He was friendly and welcomed us to the restaurant and went over the menu which has lots of interesting breakfast options. I ordered the matcha tea which I was told they ran out of two days before. We went with the croque madame and the flap jacks. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The croque madame was served with a side salad. Why? Who wants a salad for breakfast? Some sort of potatoes would have been a perfect accompaniment. The sandwich itself was good. The flavors were excellent but the cheese was not melted at all.   The flap jacks were three large pancakes served with whipped cream and berries. They were too dark and burnt tasting so we told Marco who had them remade. When they came out again it was the same thing so we didn't eat them.   Between the front of house issues and the food, this was definitely a two star experience \"Meh Ive experienced better\". I am giving them 3 stars however because they took the pancakes off the bill which I greatly appreciate. As a new business I am definitely going to come back and give them another chance so I can try out some more dishes from the menu and hopefully the service will be improved.",

I drank it in like 3 sips Lol  We started w the Shortrib Empanadas and they were awaesome! With such great menu options I was torn on what to order for food, I went with the frittata, which was good but I had high hopes and was let down by my choice. I really should've gotten the savory french toast as it was more unique and that was what I was looking for. It was the roasted vegetables that sold me on the frittata, but were also the biggest let down as there were not as much veggies as I had expected by the description.  My mate got the Suckling Pig which was super delicious! We were also given a glass of Hibiscus Iced Tea to try and that was really good too (but nothing held a candle to my latte and we both got one for the road).   We were in the area the next weekend and were upset that we wouldn't be able to get there before closing as we were psyched to try more of their awesome offerings - definitely keeping this place bookmarked for future trips to Hendertucky!",

    "text": "NEW FAVORITE BRUNCH SPOT From the incredible staff to the gorgeous presentation of their phenomenal food. If you plan on eating here I first would recommended making a reservation because this place is always packed and parking can be a pain in the butt. First off this place took me by complete surprise! Yelp recommendation(always coming in clutch) and one for the books! First off I would like to say thank you to the Chef. Who came and dropped off our food as well as answered all of our questions, which I had plenty of! Personally we started off with the Avocado toast which was absolutely perfect. The bread was toasted perfectly. The balance of spices and herbs was incredible , best avocado toast I've ever had (so good I forgot to take a picture) I ended up with the chilaquiles which were nothing short of spectacular. Every ingredient was able to be appreciated without being over powering. And the side of salsa was to die for! Perfect amount of kick and flavor! My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and I must say I probably finished 40% of her dish. You can always taste the quality of the batter when added something else to the bite(10/10). The chicken was cooked to perfection with the breading being on point leading to every single bite being extraordinary. From the outstanding presentation of the food to the amazing taste To the best lighting I've ever seen in a brunch spot  To the taste of the food being so incredible it's hard to walk out from being so full To the chef who takes pride in his work. Truly amazed! Thank you yelp for the recommendation and thank you Chef for your time   The Playlist here by the way",

    "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed this fairly new breakfast/brunch spot high up in the Henderson/ Anthem area.  The second story location is bright and airy; the decor chic yet classic, and wait staff is definitely a little hipster.  I loved the live herb wall near the kitchen that actually gets used.  I also loved that the prep/expatiator station looked like someone's home, complete with bookshelves above the pass-through window.     They definitely put a lot of thought into the menu.  A little something for everyone- from traditional to vegan- with their creative dishes.  They also have a tea lounge and a large selection of decadent pastries if you are so inclined.  Short Rib Empanada ($8) braised short rib, cheese, chilies, cream, and salsa w/ black beans.  Perfection!  The shell had a perfect crunch while the filling was soft and very flavorful  Cinnamon Roll ($4) Simply amazing.  They bring out the cinnamon roll, and then pour the delectable icing over it table side.     Dirty BLT ($11) Jalapeno Bacon, tomato jam, avocado, fried egg.  OMG, that jalapeno bacon was awesome.  I could eat that every day!  Street Taco Benny ($14) Carnitas, black beans, pickled onions, and salsa on 3 small tortillas with 2 eggs and hollandaise sauce on top.  I ordered mine sans hollandaise.  Delicious.  The pickled onion really added something and the carnitas were so tender and tasty.   Regular Iced Tea & Coke ($4 ea) - This price is a little excessive especially considering they were stingy on refilling the small glasses.  I had to ask for refills after they sat empty through most of our meal.  This was consistent with our somewhat slow and inattentive service, but we were having a nice time and didn't mind too much.  Another reason I removed a star is that I ordered the Cereal Milk Yogurt ($5) as a starter, but it never arrived (even after our entrees) and I had to ask for it to be removed from the bill.  All in all, I would definitely still return.  There are a bunch of items on the menu I need to try!",

Had the Squished Egg sandwich, cake batter scones, vegan chocolate chip cookie (truly better than the OG), lemon raspberry muffin (please for your sanity get it), poutine waffle, Country benny, and Dem Fancy Egg (comes in a smoker!!!!! Like what what). Along with lattes and bottomless mimosas. Everyone absolutely loved their food and I would love to come back and try more of their splendid lil brunch menu (jk, it's not so little. Prepare yourself to make some serious crisis decisions when deciding between 8 things you want) or to try their beer menu.   Their home potatoes are rad too. And they have a vegan menu.   Make a reso!!!   PS. Mike (our server) was the bomb. You da best.",

    "text": "Ok so read my review to understand my score.   Part 1. this is factoring in 2 different experiences with in the last month with the exact same or worse timing. IT IS THE SLOWEST ticket turn times in the world... be prepared to order your food and sit for an hour with out food. Today we ordered our 1.4 year olds food first and even that (one egg, fruit, and bacon) took over 40 minutes to come out in fact we had to beg for it. The waiting is terrible. The service from our waitress today was pretty good she did catch a mistake and send it back to cooks before we saw it which was nice but if she was a little more attentive we would have ordered more drinks....   Part 2. The Food  It was delicious!! I had the chicken sandwich which was filled with amazing flavor and spice and I loved the egg on top. My wife had a pecan pancake (which was luke warm or cool  at best but tasted great!) and Eggs Benedict which where fantastic.   So the foods great, the wait time is atrocious and the service is average... if your taking kids good luck! If you have all day to wait around this will at least be a great meal.... would I go back... eh idk maybe maybe not... would I recommend it...probably not! Chances of frustration are high...",

    "text": "Came here for brunch and immediately I was impressed with the ambience of the Second Story restaurant on the edge of anthem.  After getting seated I was very impressed with the menu and drink selections and was puzzled on which ones to give a try.  Finally went with the cappuccino to drink which was by far the best thing I had in the restaurant. Delicious l!  To eat I ordered the sausage and pancake on a stick and the empanadas. The sausage pancake batter and sausage was decent. The mustard and syrup dipping sauce was very odd though. I think they should just have both in seperate cups rather than mix them. The empanadas were nice and crispy but pretty ordinary in flavor and also quite small. So if you have many people at your table order at least three of these appetizers.  After that I ordered the suckling pig Benedict which looked amazing when it was plated  up in front of me. The flavor however for this Benedict was average and void of any substantial flavor. The poached eggs came out almost well done like a boiled egg. So tell them how you want your yolks when ordering.  The service here was pretty slow and it seemed as if these waiters were overwhelmed and still getting broken in to this restaurant.  The manager here did comp our meal since they messed up our order but I probably will give this place one more try in the future to give some of their pastries and definitely the pecan pie pancake a try.",

Stove Service:  Our server was on it as she took care of the orders for 4 kids and 11 adults like a pro.  3 of us went for the bottomless mimosas and after seeing we were pros, she smartly left 2 bottles and a carafe of juices at the table. Well done.  Stove cuisine: We sampled the corn dogs for appetizers and they were flavorful.  The blueberry scones and the assorted pastries selected by the chef were delicious and fresh.  I had the monte cristo and it was delicious.  The bread was battered perfectly, tasty and not too sweet.  I wish there was just a little bit more ham, but overall it was excellent.  Also, the salad that came with it was extremely fresh and complimented the sandwich well. The kids meals came served in lunch boxes which was a nice touch, packaging is everything.  The portions are on the generous end but not everbearing.  Stove ambiance:  Pastel colors utilized throughout the walls and the chandeliers felt warm and inviting.  The flowers and foliage kept the dining area fresh as well.  The total ambiance makes for a very nice dining experience.  This is the 3rd restaurant I've seen in this location and I think the Stove is going to be just fine.  Overall this is definitely a brunch place I'd visit again especially with the bottomless mimosas at $18 and the tasty food.  See you there, enjoy! =)",

The spacious dining and open kitchen area has plenty for your eyes to take in.  The inviting area makes it quite comfortable. Fully equipped with their own selfie staged area, pop in for some quick pics! I would probably recommend doing this before the food comes out so we don't have food in our teeth.  On to the food~ Their version of the Scottish egg truly showed their fusion style with the egg wrapped in chorizo on a bed of potatoes. It is lightly drizzled with crema for a delightful flavor all around.  Definitely a great start to the meal.  The Muffuletta sandwich is an Italian sandwich filled with a spicy jardiniere.  It's delicious but fair warning... very very spicy.  The Maharaja sandwich is a fried chicken sandwich with an Indian flair of spice.  Every bite was scrumptious.  Both sandwiches are worth ordering again.  My hope is The Stove sticks around for a while.  I'm anxious to work my way through the exciting menu.",

Met a friend for brunch about a week ago to check this place out.  I like the vibe, very hip and trendy. We got there around 12:30 on a Thursday and were seated right away. Had a server come over right away and get us some drinks. Since I was headed to work, and my friend on lunch break, we ordered quickly. She got the pancakes and I got the avocado toast. We decided we would each share.  The food took a long time to come out. And that is the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. The server did check on us frequently while waiting which was nice.  The food itself is presented well and you could tell the ingredients were super fresh. The pancakes were topped with fresh blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. The pancakes themselves were large, fluffy and delicious. The avocado toast was so good! I love  a good poached egg and it was a nice touch to the dish.  I'd definitely eat here again.",

    "text": "My friend and I came here for brunch last weekend after one of my coworkers had recommended this place to me. The Stove replaced Standard and Pour, which sat on the 2nd floor of the building. We had arrived around noon and the place was packed. After we walked up the stairs, the hostess asked if we had been on the online wait list. APPARENTLY THEY HAVE AN ONLINE WAITLIST... BUT ITS NOT ON YELP ! Go to their web site and you'll see a link to the waitlist ! Being labor day weekend, we were told the wait was 60 - 90 minutes, BUT if there were seats at the bar, we are free to sit there instead. With no particular preference on seating, we went to the bar and lucky us, seats had just opened so we had sat down on the far left seats.   We were greeted by the bartender. My co-worker had recommended the \"French Press Coffee\" as well as the \"Suckling Pig Benedict\", so those were the things i got. My friend had gotten the \"Egg Tacos\" with an \"orange juice\". Being a holiday weekend, the restaurant was super busy. The bartender was making drinks for the entire restaurant while serving us and making sure we were ok. If anything, it was entertaining for us to watch everything happening around us. The entire meal took about 2 hours but at least it was entertaining. Accidental spills to seeing how many people it takes to open a champagne bottle, it was not a boring 2 hours, to say the least. Our food took about 45 minutes or so to arrive, right when my friend had mentioned she was starting to feel really hungry. HA perfect timing  \"French Press Coffee\" - I did not expect to get the entire \"pitcher\", container.. whatever you call the french press contraption. You can get at least 5 cups of coffee out of this thing. Oh man ! Thats too much coffee for 1 person HAHA ! Typically i drink my coffee with some half & half/creamer but i decided to try it before i asked for some. I've never had french press coffee either so it was a new experience. Surprisingly, even without anything, it wasn't acidic and was pretty smooth. Don't know if its because the type of coffee they used or because it was brewed with a french coffee press... who knows ??   \"Suckling Pig Benedict\" - smoked pig, biscuits, poached eggs, brown butter hollandaise, house bbq, and jalapeno chips  Besides the mildly overdone poached eggs where i didn't get my ooey gooey flowing all over the place yolk... everything else tasted really good. The side salad with some dried orange colored something (i couldnt tell what it was) and some super soft flavored diced potatoes were both good as well... When i think suckling pig, i think of the baby suckling pig made chinese style, butterflied open w/ thin crispy skin... MMM LOL ANYWAY ! so this \"smoked pig\" has more of \"stringy\" aspect to it like a braised meat but was flavorful and tender. Biscuits was fresh and hot. Good amount of food.   \"Egg Tacos\" - chorizo and egg, potatoes, salsa arbol, crema, oaxaca cheese  3 small tacos on corn tortillas with a egg and chorizo scramble w/ potatoes topped with sour cream and cheese... Whats not mentioned is the pickled white and purple onions. My friend didn't like the pickled onions but i think it helps to cut through the \"heaviness\" of the egg and chorizo as well as the creaminess of the sour cream and cheese. Quite \"tiny\" in terms of amount in comparison to the benedict for the same price.   Overall, atmosphere was lively and fun to watch. The bartender, (Abby? Annie? Ally?) was super nice. She was SOOOO busy but she still tried to make attempts to chat with us and check up on us. She opened at least 10-20 bottles of champagne during our brunch.   I'd recommend this place for people to try. Nice, chill atmosphere. Not sure if its a regular thing or just during brunch. A guy was playing guitar and singing live in the middle of the restaurant as well. Occassionally, a waiter will roll out a cart for tableside banana foster pancakes.",

    "text": "First let me start off-be prepared to wait...a long time. We waited over an hour for a table of 4 for brunch on a Saturday. We enjoyed some cocktails while we waited, but they don't really have room for people to wait.   Secondly, while we were waiting, along with everyone else who was waiting, I noticed that the whole other half of their restaurant was empty! Saved for people who want to have tea. Now this makes no sense with how many people were waiting and the amount of time that people were waiting for them to have half of their restaurant unavailable!   Food: everything we had was delicious. We ordered a bunch of different items and shared everything. We started with the empanadas, Mexican ice cream, and sausage corn dogs. All three were very delicious. The empanadas have a great spice. My favorite of the three. Next we ordered the churro waffles, suckling pig Benedict, and the street tacos Benedict. The churro waffle was very similar to the Mexican ice cream dish. The two Benedict's were so delicious.   I will definitely be back to try more of their food, because everything was delicious. But I do hope they work out the wait times and open the other area of their restaurant during busy brunch weekends because otherwise it's a zoo in there.",

That's pretty much the only positive about the experience. Our server had a bad attitude Service was suuuuuuuper slow. No sense of urgency at all.  The food was just ok. Nothing to write home about. The menu looks awesome tho.. maybe an off day? I dunno. Kind of reminds me of kitchen table on Horizon Ridge but not as good.  There are better places to brunch in town. It's too bad, but I won't be back.",

Though the bar is limited, they have some refreshing cocktails.  As for food, there is something for everyone. My husband likes the Mexican eggs with chorizo, and the kids like the birthday pancakes, doused with rainbow sprinkles.  My personal favorite is the roasted tomato soup with grilled cheese with seared mushrooms. Service can be slow so I don't go if I'm in a time crunch.  My major complaint is the lack of consistency of flavor and preparation. Each time it's a different, sometimes better sometimes...not.",

The first time I had corned beef hash and the beef was extremely salty it was almost inedible, the second time I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was a weird dark meat cut so I couldn't eat half of it and the Mac and cheese waffle was bland -  both of those needed to be seasoned. I did share the pecan pie waffles and those were delicious and they have some fun homemade flavor syrups. The tables are really small and packed in tightly, the service is slow even for a quiet weekday afternoon and everything is a little wore out for it being a newish restaurant. Over all it's good in theory, cute atmosphere, but nothing I'd go back for.",

Aside from the foie gras French toast which was good, the service was on and off (service through brunch was all right - our server was very funny, but noone even offered me water while I waited for the rest of my party at the table) and the main dish, the Suckling Pig, was mediocre - the pork was cooked well but the barbecue sauce especially was absolutely lacking in creativity, it was just plainsweet without any spice or citrus tang to cut through the sugar. Since everything was at least \"okay\" and the pricing is reasonable, even though I find it absolutely not worth the trek to the edge of Anthem, I think four stars makes sense. I'm hoping ownership takes a look at this and revamps the menu a bit - I see there's passion put into this but the execution is just off.",

I ordered the Benedict Arnold and I wasn't impressed. It was basically a beyond meat patty cut in half, put on a toasted bun thing, with tofu scramble on top. It just seemed like a stretch and badly put together. Nothing tasted terrible...it just wasn't as good of quality as I'd expect at a restaurant.   My friend had the vegan tacos and seemed to enjoy them. We also both had the vegan cookie. It was yummy.    I ordered a side of pickles and wasn't impressed. It was a bunch of quick pickled red pepper pieces, some red onion, some cauliflower, and some cucumbers. They all had the same flavor and it was just underwhelming.   They have a big selection of bottomless mimosas so thats fun and reason enough to come back.   My friend says the vegan skillet is good and there's a vegan burrito to try. I'll prob come back one of these days...maybe try something different on the menu. Def order more mimosas",

    "text": "I have been here a few times already with my fiance the staff always remembers us and is so nice. The food is always great my fave is the churro waffle tho today's pork empanadas were a game changer.  Today I went in with plans for 3 of my girlfriends to meet me for lunch. I sat at a table in the tea room the restaurant was packed. Last minute all 3 girls canceled on me and I didn't want to take up a whole table. So I moved to the coffee bar and ordered breakfast by myself. I was so annoyed with my friends but I decided to stick around and get food and a mimosa to try to fix my mood. Abbey behind the bar was funny and chatted it up with an older couple next to me.   The food was perfect and I'm a new fan of hibiscus mimosa. Landon a server that recognized me surprised me and bought my lunch as a thank u for being a regular. That turned my day around I literally had to hug him and tell him thank you.   Chef Antonio is awesome he was at the bar chatting with me and the older couple next to me about how they make everything from scratch even their bitters for cocktails which I can appreciate as a bartender myself. He always comes by ghetables to check on people and ask how the food is. I over heard him saying they don't advertise they like people to hear about the restaurant by word of mouth. So this is me spreading the word that not only is the food amazing here but so if the staff  thank you guys for fixing what was a horrible lunch date into a perfect Sunday afternoon.",

This is why I love asking servers for personal recommendations. I don't know what I was expecting for breakfast, but it wasn't this. Totally blew my mind. A taste explosion with an amazing texture. With tortilla chips, oaxacan red sauce, oaxacan cheese, scrambled eggs, beans, creama and an egg on top. I will definitely be back here for more early outings",

    "text": "Decided to come check this place out on a Sunday for brunch. I had called ahead to see i can do a wait list of some sort and there was, the wait at the time was 75 minutes! But the hostess did mention is usually about half the wait time that is indicated on the site. Arrived there when I was number 14 on the list and waited for another 30-40 mins or so. There were empty tables available but they were not seating, could be due to short on staff.  Finally after a long wait, we we seated outside, at first it was fine but as you sat longer it was getting really warm, and there are no fans or air of any sort! ( so would not recommend on sitting outside till it gets into the 70's).   It took about another 20 mins or so, before someone came and poured water and took out drink order. Then finally the waitress came and took out food order. Food took some time as it was really busy that day with a baby shower going on as well. But I wish it would have been quicker.   Food was not bad, but the waiting really got us frustrated! Would I come back and give them another chance? Maybe? But I only the service would be better. I don't expect to be a fast food place, but please acknowledge that we are there and come check on us often and food wait isn't so long.",

    "text": "Our favorite breakfast spot! We've only gone about 4 times so far but each time the service and food has been spot on. The atmosphere is lovely and there are a few tables with views. The menu is compact and definitely for \"foodies\", with interesting combinations and lots of opportunity to try new twists on favorites. If you're looking for something a little different, this is a great spot. The presentation leans on the hipster side, with portions being smaller than those chain diners so you leave feeling full and satisfied but not stuffed. I can highly recommend all the Benedicts (cooked perfectly every time), the Croque Madame, and the pancakes. The pancake syrup is amazing! Two different options (vanilla and bourbon). But just a heads up, my picky 7 year old doesn't like it. And try the morning happy hour! It's a good deal!",

    "text": "I would rate this 3.5 to 4 stars. Located on the second floor of the building. It's a fun atmosphere, very casual so expect it to be kind of loud. They offer patio seating and the inside gets a lot of natural light. I ordered the empanadas and caviar duo. Both were okay, nothing outstanding. My partner ordered the classic benedict and she loved it (it tasted better than mine). We also ordered the bottomless mimosas, which is always fun and got to try all flavors (offered daily at $18). Our server was cool, the place seemed a bit short staffed but it was a Wednesday, probably the reason why patio was closed. I did notice they were pretty flexible in orders and pay attention to detail which is a great quality.  For example, as much as I appreciate creativity for the caviar duo, the plate originally is made with a sunny side up egg. I was looking more for a plate of caviar with the hard boiled egg yolk and egg white. I ordered it hard boiled expecting to cut up and separate the white from the yolk myself but when they brought me the plate is was beautifully done for me.  I love High Tea Service so I'd come back to check that out (only $25).",

Right away I checked out the kids menu and ordered her a PB&J and myself a latte.   The PB&J came in a lunchbox, a pink one. A tin lunch box! The PB&J was CRUSTLESS (insert super dramatic crying emoji here) was perfectly jammed and perfectly peanut buttered, 1/2 a cookie, a good size fruit cup with exotic fruit. And a little dinosaur! She LOVED the fruit most of all. This was Olivia tested and approved! My latte was perfect in temperature. The espresso not too bitter..the foam was delightful. I love a classic latte..especially for the first visit. I wanted to try everything off the menu. The selections and flavors seem endless...and the menu is seasonal..changing flavors yum! I ordered the Sausage Corn Dog (3)sausages dipped and fried in pancake batter with a whole grain mustard maple sauce (syrup lol) they were great! Not greasy..a soft pancake with a light sausage snap. Oh SNAP!  I also ordered (oh gosh I don't remember the exact name) creme brulee? oatmeal. This is almost dessert.. AMAZING!   To top off the great food.. The server-Alec, was fantastic. He acknowledged my daughter which is greatly appriciated in a server (or human being for that matter) she's a guest too!  The concept is great..I hope the Stove sticks around for a long time!  I can't wait to come back! Thank you!",

I would definitely get it again. I'm a Benedict kind of girl, but when I saw that they do Bananas Foster Pancakes table-side, I had to go for it. SooooooooGooooooood    I could literally stay here all day, drinking coffee, eating their yummy pastries (they have a special donut daily) & peering out their large front window. WHILE they have live music  the guy w/ his guitar has a GREAT set list Just a guy, his guitar & a microphone   They even do PROPER TEA/FORMAL TEA TIME (Reservation for \"tea time\" required) I'm definitely going to do this!! Every once in awhile you just need a reason to be fancy  My sister has to eat gluten-free, so I'm stoked to see they have tons of those options available.(NOT gluten-free pancakes though)  I actually thought about keeping this place secret(to NOT ruin such a cool place) BUT it's going to be a favorite of mine, I can tell.  SO, to keep it open, I definitely recommend coming & experiencing this little spot for yoursel",

    "text": "So, I never typically do this, but I'm writing down this experience as I go because I know I will have a lot to say about this establishment.   First impression: oh my gosh how cool is this place! Super trendy, bright, inviting and the decor is giving me all the heart eye emojis! I love that the elevator opens right into the restaurant and the feel of this place. The ceiling tile with the contrasting black wood look wall, the funky decor, and the bar setup. The tables look chic and modern. Overall 10 stars on this!   We were given a 30-45 minute wait time and I don't believe we even waited that long. We were given the option to visit the bar area for pastries and drinks so we went over and took an open seat. We ordered a funfetti scone and had the sugar cookie and took advantage of starting off with the unlimited mimosas. The pastries are AMAZING! The funfetti scone was really good but that sugar cookie stole the show for me. Our bartender, Victoria was very sweet, welcoming and made us feel at home. Compliments to her for giving us the impression that we looked for when deciding to visit The stove.   Our table was finally ready although we waited about another 15 minutes to get seated which was a little odd but I figured we had time to wait anyways, might as well enjoy our mimosas although we would have liked to refill. This is where things went a little off, but I'm not knocking off stars simply because the first impression and the food were both absolutely amazing. We finally were sat and waited an additional 10 minutes to be greeted by the server who unfortunately so, wasn't very enthusiastic. She's pleasant, maybe just an off day? I won't discredit that. She's got a good sense of humor regardless. We're peppy, excited and had a few questions but the wait time has kind of downed our vibe a bit. We ordered our second round of mimosas and it probably took another 10 minutes before it came out. Essentially, at the end of the day, I'm not going to discredit service because it is a little lengthy, just make sure you have time to fully enjoy your experience.   Food: Excuse my language, holy hell. We started with the empanadas and being Hispanics from Miami who just moved, we love our empanadas. These by far exceeded our expectations. The black bean puree and the pickled peppers/jalapeno, were such a nice touch. I'll come back just for this.  My boyfriend ordered the country fried steak and it was great! Has a nice kick, and the steak is thick but still crunchy, honestly not a single complaint.  Now, here's the main part of this review, The. Suckling. Pig. Oh my. I have no words. Do not even question the menu. This is the best part. I can't even describe it! The biscuits were crunchy, the bbq sauce is such a great compliment, the mini salad freshens up the savory goodness, the pickled jalapenos give a nice vinegar and spice component. One tiny minor detail (which works in my favor because I don't prefer runny eggs) the eggs were a tad over done. The potatoes at the bottom became my vice. So good!   Being foodies, we have a lot to say about food but everything here was absolutely perfect. If you want to excite your palate, try new twists on flavors and fill yourself up on quality ingredients, visit and order. No brunch compares. And that's coming from a Miami couple where brunch is a a known Sunday \"holiday\" every weekend. Compliments to all!   Also, Alec, who we had the pleasure of meeting when he brought our food out, was great. You can see his passion and drive when he talks about the food, the menu and the business. Thank you Alec for welcoming us and giving us recommendations for our next visit!   We will definitely be back and bringing all of our visitors to try brunch here.",

    "text": "This place is cute and has all the things every girl wants to throw up on her instagram: cute backgrounds, cute food and drinks like unicorn hot chocolate, mimosas, cute signs and decor.   But the first thing you have to deal with: the hostesses. And from my experience on a Sunday afternoon, I was annoyed. The hostesses are rude to be honest. Blame it on their age, but I don't care for the repetitive attitude when I haven't really bothered them, wasn't standing in their way and simply replying to THEIR questions. This definitely turned me off to this place because I'm not sure why they're snobby.   I will say the male servers were really nice and friendly and the ladies at the bar who made our drinks while we waited were also super sweet. So there's some balance to their staff.   Wait is average for a brunch place but once you've been seated, waiting for the food was also long. I think we arrived around 12, got seated around 1250, got our food around 1:35.   The taste of the food is good. And the amount is also good. Pretty standard prices for brunch, as well.   I may consider going back based on the food but I'm having a hard time convincing myself that dealing with snobby hostesses is worth it if it'll be busy.",

    "text": "I came here for my birthday for brunch. There has been lots of hype on IG about this place, so I was excited to try. The space is small but cutely decorated in like a west elm style. First off, it took about 6 phone calls and an IG message to get a reservation for twisted tea. The twisted tea could use more variety of tea cocktails and should include the unique cocktails on the regular menu which it didnt.  The cups and teapot and serving tray were cute though. We had an amazing waitress, very funny and friendly.  The pastries and tea were just Ok. They didnt taste fresh and lacked luster. My fiance had eggs & bacon. The eggs were decent but served on lettuce, hot eggy lettuce kinda odd. Bacon was really good. Matza ball soup was poured out of thermos tableside, but lacked flavor. Broth was bland. I ordered the empanadas that were really tasty, but came out lukewarm. Cereal Milk Yogurt came out without any cereal or cereal flavor. It was just plain yogurt and fruit. The waitress said it used to come with a delicious yogurt steeped in fruit loop cereal, but not anymore. She later brought a side of fruity pebbles cereal, which still didnt help the bland dish. My experience was just Ok. The ambiance was nice but food was definitely lacking. The photobooth was a nice touch. Im not sure if I would go back.",

Lots of trendy kids here with money to spend on the decor of the place. You are just paying for the decoration of the restaurant honestly not food quality. Water had so much particles in it but drank it anyways since water refills were scarce here. Better off going to craftkitchen or kitchen table tbh.",

    "text": "I'm through the roof on this great new eatery here in Henderson. This is the third restaurant to occupy this beautiful location since we've been in town and I truly hope the word gets out on the fantastic food and service presented at The Stove.   It is one of the most customer focused breakfast/lunch restaurants I've been to in a while, which included a thorough understanding of the menu by our waiter along with him bringing our daughter stickers and a little toy to play with. During the course of our meal four different employees asked how we were and if there was anything we needed. That level of customer engagement is welcomed and is a stand out trait above any similar spots here in the valley.   The menu is expansive and it was hard to choose as my eyes were hungry looking at all the different twists on my breakfast favorites, however I settled in on a Country Fried Steak Benedict and a cotton candy French press coffee. The cotton candy fresh press was awesome visually as the pour melted it down into a sweet coffee treat. The melt in your mouth country fried steak was perfectly cooked and accompanied by a tangy spicy gravy. My wife had the suckling pig Benedict which featured some of the best smoked ham I've had in town. Our daughter loved the waffles with vanilla butter, sliced strawberries and fresh maple syrup.   The drink menu is lush and has a little something for everyone. I had the creamsicle mimosa and my wife had the blackberry mimosa. Both fresh and bubbly with good champagne. There is also a Vegan menu that offers a ton of awesome selections beyond the typical one or two options at other brunch locations. We didn't get a chance to check out all the details on the Twisted Tea Room, but it seems to be a rocking high tea with options for food accompaniment, in a reimagined English fashion.   Overall, this is probably... ok IS... some of the best breakfast food in town, with big servings at reasonable prices. We really look forward to bringing friends and family back soon and wish them all the most success. Share the word and eat up!",

    "text": "Don't waste your time. My mother had been dying to try this place so I took her for her 70th birthday brunch. From the moment we walked in the door we were not impressed. The girl at the hostess stand greeted me and when I told her how many were in our party, she responded with \"Oh, tell her...\" and gestures to another young lady walking our way. (Um, ok.) So I approach the other girl and give her our info. We were quoted a 45 minute wait which was no problem for us because of all the amazing reviews we had read. We found a nice spot on their patio to sit and wait for the text that I was told I would get when the table was ready. After a short while we noticed people that had come in after us were getting sat. We went in and when we sat down on the waiting bench inside the hostess approached us and asked for our information again. When we reminded her it was just the 2 of us, she sat us right away at a table that had been vacant since we walked in the first time over 20 minutes prior. Once we were sat our server came right to us. He was warm and welcoming. We order the deviled eggs to share, a crabby patty Benedict, and a croque madam. The eggs came out in a timely manner and were delicious! But while we were sitting there the table next to us had a problem with their food taking a really long time and then being cold when once they finally got it. Of course this made us nervous but we figured once one table has a challenge they would step up their game.....nope. Our main dishes took entirely too long, to the point even our server was wondering where it was. When we finally got our order my mother's food wasn't hot and we only had 10 minutes to eat and run to get to an appointment. We asked for the check right away to avoid another long wait and when it came, we were charged for everything. Our server did verbally apologize but no management presence came to speak to us, no discount offered, nothing. AFTER I had signed the check we were offered a latte.........no thanks. It probably would have taken an hour to get and been cold. It's too bad this whole experience went down this way because the flavor of the food was very good but unfortunately our celebratory brunch had been ruined by the overall experience. We definitely won't be back.",

We left and will not be back. This location has had several restaurants that all closed after a short while, I expect this one will not last long either. We walked next door to Kneaders, a bakery that serves sandwiches and salads, and found other people there who also got tired of waiting at The Stove.",

We also ordered the short rib empanada. It was okay, it was missing something like pickled onions or a truffle honey creme fraiche. Needed some pop, it was really boring.",

We ordered and after about 20 mins our waiter informed us there was \"a large party of 7 was in front of us\" which is why it would be taking longer.  I appreciated the heads up, I guess I didn't know 7 was considered big.  Our party of 3 ordered two Caesar salads and chilaquiles.  After 30+ mins the dishes arrived and the chilaquiles has to be sent back, tortillas were soggy and dish was cold.  Caesar was ok although the dressing was so light it was essentially the same as have no dressing at all.   My guest with the chilaquiles said it was pretty bad and seemed premade and heated.  Won't be back to this hipster joint.",

I tried to have a friend's baby shower in the tea room, but it would have been more expensive than what Mandarin Oriental (slash Waldorf Astoria) quoted me and the Stove was not at all willing to work with me on the price. Then, I tried to take that same friend to the Stove for our last girl's lunch before her baby was born, and it was a total ordeal. I had to call about 6 times until I finally got someone on the phone to make a reservation. Then I read some of the rude responses of this business to customers on Yelp. I also saw the sad, half empty plates that are served with the afternoon tea that I was going to take my friend to. (Note to this business, you should probably check out the afternoon tea experience at your competitor, Waldorf Astoria. Whether you are serving \"twisted tea\" or not, you still need to fill up your plates.) I decided that with everything that had happened so far along with the experience of other customers who have been to the Stove, I'd rather take my business elsewhere. So then I did a couple of rounds of attempting to contact the restaurant to cancel my reservation and finally got through. Then, a day before my cancelled reservation would have happened I got a text message confirming my reservation. So I cancelled it again....",

We started with the Mexican Egg - an appetizer we will likely get every time. It's an egg wrapped in chorizo and fried...absolutely heavenly. For entrees we chose the Croque Madame and the Suckling Pig Benedict. Both looked and tasted delicious. The restaurant was fairly busy when we were there (Sunday at 10am), but the service was still excellent. Finishing our dining experience off with a trip into the selfie photo booth was the best - We are already counting the days until our return for brunch. Oh - and the view from the restaurant is fantastic....one of the best! I give this place an A+.",

    "text": "I am very hesitant to write this review. After seeing all the amazing reviews for this place I had high expectations. The first thing I will say is the fact you can put your name on the wait list before you even get there is awesome! Even doing so, we waited for a table for about an hour, which is understandable since it was a Sunday afternoon and there was 7 of us. But no big deal, we sat at the bar downstairs while we waited. When we got seated the server came over right away and gave us menus and took our drink order. I was kind of annoyed because she made me feel stupid when I asked her a simple question. I was just a bit confused on if you could get flavors for both the iced coffee and iced lattes because the menu only had them listed under regular coffee, and she told me an iced coffee is an iced coffee and an iced late is an iced late. Ok, my question may have been a little ridiculous to some but she didn't have to answer me the way she did. Anyways, it took a while for her to come back to get our food order and when she did we asked if it was possible to do split checks. I am in the service industry and I get how annoying split checks are but if someone tells you in the begging of the meal, its really not that bad. She answered with maybe, its hard to do on a Sunday. I've used every POS system in restaurants and there is no maybe! You either can or you cant and I know some places are strict but no where did it say they had a policy against it, and if the answer was no, it would have been totally fine. I ordered the short rib empanada to start with and the Crabby Patty Benedict for my meal. The empanada was just ok, not as great as all the hype but still tasty. I liked the fact you could see the kitchen, but that also meant we could see our food just sitting there for a while waiting to be ran to the table. The cinnamon roll our friend ordered was amazing though, so creamy and delicious. My Crab Benedict, which was not cheap by the way, had what seemed like a healthy serving of King Crab which turned out to be 3 small bites worth. My boyfriend said his Country Fried Steak and Eggs were a bit rubbery and he has definitely had better. Other dishes on the table were the Croque Madam (just average) and some Chiliquiles (not worth a second look). It was enjoyable for the company but I probably wouldn't come back for brunch. Maybe just some tea and pastries. The one fun part as well was the selfie booth! That was a fun ending to a mediocre meal.",

I started with one of their house-made biscuits and berry jam, easily the best biscuit I have had in my life over 60 years! I followed it with the Crabbie Pattie Eggs Benedict and savored every bite. My wife had the Farmhouse Breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and house potatoes. Our meals were garnished with fresh herbs growing in small pots on a wall. The owners came over and chatted with us, and our server Rebecca was incredibly nice and caring. I only wish I could give The Stove 10 stars.  Finally, a reasonably priced gourmet restaurant in Henderson.",

    "text": "Okay... This place has such great reviews that I am surprised our experience was so bad.  The food was awful. Unique, which is cool, I got the Brie pancakes and my friend got the churro waffles, but just not good. Three dry pancakes with savory cheese on them? I figured it would be sweet brie cheese. When I read the menu again, they arrived as described, so that's on me, of course, I just did not like them at all.  We got drinks, too. My friend got the chocolate monkey. The server described it as a very choclatey drink with espresso. It was a tea latte, not espresso and it didn't taste like chocolate. The server told my friend that she just needs to let it steep longer to make it more taste more like chocolate... it didn't work. They did however bring her a completely new drink for free.  I got the cotton candy French press. Decent but I'd recommend having the cotton candy in a separate container because using the whole piece for one cup was a bit too sweet, just my preference, obviously! Finally, the service... really it just seemed like the server was new. She didn't describe my friends drink correctly at all. We asked if they had breakfast potatoes. She looked at us like we were crazy. She said no. But I noticed that the eggs Benedict came with potatoes so I asked about those. She said they were just chopped potatoes....? We were confused. She was hard to flag down for refills and condiments. But at the end of the meal (that we barely ate) she was SO talkative and present. Telling us all about how busy they are on weekends and how you can get on the waitlist online, that there is live music... we were standing up at our table trying leave and she kept talking. She even asked if we would come back. It was a bit awkward.  Unfortunately, we just didn't enjoy ourselves. We won't be back.",

Meanwhile my server was not on the ball like when you order breakfast please put out a salt and pepper shaker on the table, he also brought food out at intervals so we all didn't eat at the same time.  We had to repeatedly ask for things that he forgot. He seemed as though he was not in the mood to be at work, but come on you just got there.  When we were leaving the hostess yelled out something like \"I hope you have a nice day!\" sarcastically.  I remember going to the owners first restaurant called Kitchen Table and he said something stupid to me like \"Why did you come here you could have went down the street?\"  Pretty nice for a first week of opening.   From now on I won't patronize any of your restaurants!  My money works just as well down the street at Kraft Kitchen!!",

The staff was very nice and very accommodating. A person in our group had back surgery and was using a walker and they sat us in an area where we would be comfortable and out of the way. The restaurant is fairly small but it was clean and nice.   Now for the food and drinks. The coffee is great. If you like strong coffee you will like it too. I had the chicken and waffles. I have to tell you, I'm not a fan of chicken and waffles but this chicken is AWESOME!!! Just about the best chicken I've ever had in my life. It was so good I wanted to call my mom and tell her about this chicken. The waffle that came with it was good. It also came with a spicy syrup that I didn't care for. Lucky there was regular syrup on the table that I used instead. We also ordered the flap jacks. It was a nice big stack that I split with my son. We both enjoyed it. Got a side of bacon that was cooked perfectly. My daughter got the kids meal hamburger and she really enjoyed it and the fries that came along with her order. It was cute the way it came is an old style lunch box.   There wasn't a single thing that our group ordered that we didn't like. If I had to say one negative thing about the place it would be that the music was a little loud. Maybe I was sitting near the speaker. I didenjoy the music though.   1/29/19 As much as I love this place I must warn you about the biscuit and gravy. It's not what you think it is. The biscuit part ( which didn't taste like a biscuit) is cut in half and then either fried or toasted. A good third of each half was like eating a crouton. The gravy was spicy which I don't mind but the biscuit just totally ruined this side dish. I will be back to try the other delicious looking things.",

My girlfriend had the Chilequiles (which was out of this world) and I had the chicken and waffle. Chicken and waffle is okay but you shouldn't expect it to taste like a classic southern chicken and waffle. They definitely take out a lot of typical southern flavoring that goes into fried chicken batter and the waffles just had so many damn onions on it. I didn't really get the onion thing at all.   Our server was good. Had no problem with that either.   The reason for the 2-stars came down to environment. The vibe was very dive bar meets brunch setting. There was an older couple in there that was just doing all kinds of weird things. The older guy took his shoes off and put his feet up on another chair. The woman walked over to a completely different table to pick up the silverware and use the napkin and PUT IT BACK. There was either the owner or manager that was slamming champongs and chugging giant flamingo beer things. He was yanking a waitresses hair. He was squirting cleaner from across the main room which was getting on other table's plates and silverware. Almost the entire staff were whipping each other with wash rags. The staff got into a huge whipped cream spraying war. We saw a customer drop a cup on the floor and watched a server watch them just put it back on another table. All happening in the main room.   Definitely do not recommend if you're going for a chill breakfast. Maybe I completely missed that memo. IDK. Still doesn't excuse the other things.",

    "text": "I love that very important meal between breakfast and lunch! Brunch is my favorite and The Stove is such a cute place for brunch! For the location it's at, you definitely pay a pretty penny for some of their food. The view is a beautiful addition to a delicious meal. Make sure you go early for a little to no wait and be seated quickly! Also, just so you're aware: this place is located on the second floor! I had trouble finding it, lol.  We ordered the deviled eggs and I don't think I'll order it again. I thought the yolk was supposed to get taken out, mixed with all sorts of flavors then put back in the egg...give or take a couple more steps. But the egg was just sliced (yolk still intact) with some sort of mayo on top, crunchy onions, and jalapenos. I wasn't the biggest fan.   We also got the cinnamon toast... which I could probably make myself. Nothing too fancy, really. But it was still good. I wouldn't pay that much for it, though.   My friend got the salmon Benedict with smoked salmon and that was pretty yummy! I'd probably order that next time! But I got the country friend steak. Sadly, I've had better. So maybe I'll try something different next time. So long story short, maybe try this place to try it. But it wouldn't be a place I'll keep coming back to.",

    "text": "Best brunch spot is right!  Words to describe this place based on the decor, the vibe, the layout:  unique, homey, classy, elegant, green, interesting layout, vintage  Let me start with the party next to me that was celebrating a birthday.  Their server brought out a plate with what looked like cookies/pastries with cotton candy.  Suspended over the dessert, the server sprinkled sprinkles on top.  Literally, raining sprinkles.  I should have recorded that for them.  Great view if you're seated near the windows.  Service, fantastic.  Food, awesome.  We started with the Short Ribs Empanadas and that was great.  I ordered the Suckling Pig Benny and my brother ordered the Crabby Patty Benny.  First bite of the Suckling Pig and I was like, this is good.  Midway thru, I had to tap out because it started getting salty.  I did take a bite of the Crabby Patty and I was like WOW, this is sooo good.  I think the homemade artichoke spread was what made that dish.  It was so good.  My brothers only complaint was that he wished they used more crab meat.  Today, I find out that my brother took my sister in law for brunch and they ordered the Country Fried Steak & Bangers and Eggs.  My brother said the Country Fried Steak was good and the only complaint there was was that the Bangers and Eggs, the eggs were salty and so was the salad that they got.  So it seems like some of their food is being over salted.  But other than that, so far this place has my vote!  Happy Eatings until next time!!",

    "text": "I asked my friend if she wants to have breakfast with me and we can meet at The Stove and she said yes. She told me that there's usually a wait so I checked out their site and they have an option to sign in to be on their waitlist---I thought it was a great idea considering it's a busy place.   I live on the west side of town and it took me 25mins on a Sunday morning to arrived at my destination. I checked out their Yelp reviews and their menu ahead of time so I can pre plan what I'll order. I know for sure that it will take me another month or so to visit so I really wanted to try some of their best seller.  When they told me that they run out of their empanada at 8:30 in the morning I felt a poke in my heart because I seriously love empanadas and I was a little disappointed.  So I let it go and ordered their lavender latte and their French press. I love coffee and I really enjoy the part that I'll press my own coffee---they brought my french press already pressed which is totally fine, but I like my coffee darker and stronger. I wish they'll let the guest press their own coffee.  My friend and I shared their Suckling Pig Benedict and their Savory French Toast and my oh my, they're really delicious--- although I wished I added some maple syrup to their Savory French Toast. Oh well, there's always a next time...  As we our finishing up, we both decided to try their Cinnamon roll with pecan syrup just because... At first, our server told us that they don't have one available and it will take them 45 mins. Again, there's another poke in my heart. The server even asked us if we want to try some of their pastries instead but my taste buds is craving for their cinnamon roll.   What really impressed me and the reason I'm giving them 5stars it's because of the thought that the server came back and told me that the chef is going to make me one of their cinnamon roll and I dont need to wait 45 mins for it. I seriously want to do a happy dance as soon as the sever told me. It made my day and I was truly grateful for their effort and their service.   I eat out most of the time and worked in a food industry and customer service for 10 years now, so I know how it feels when we go above and beyond to make our guest happy.   I left the place with a happy heart and happy tummy.",

    "text": "The hubby and I planned to try Kitchen Table, but because there was a long wait for a table for two- we got into our cars and made the short trek over to our original first choice - The Stove! Because we haven't tried this place yet, I was super stoked - plus it was collecting dust in my bookmark list, lol.   The wait was, zero minutes; seated right away! Score! Walking in, my first impression was welcoming, cozy, bright and fresh. I love how the kitchen is visible from all the tables because watching the food come out the kitchen is entertainment within itself. The staff is very engaging and really make you feel welcome! My overall breakfast experience was amazing. We received exceptional customer service from our server Mike- and meeting the GM, Landon and head chef, Antonio...man these dudes are super personable.   Let's talk food. So the menu is slightly all over the place, but in a good way *wink. You get the normal suspects, dishes with eggs/bacon/etc. - but it's the basic dishes with a twist is what this place is known for.   My hubby ordered the savory French toast?...let that sink in right quick. So essentially picture a normal French toast dish but think opposite. On top of his pieces of bread laid melted cheese, bacon and fried eggs with sprinkles of fresh Parmesan cheese. The most memorable thing about this dish is the white sauce the French toast is drenched in! I'm still trying to guess what it's made out of, but whatever it is, it's f/ckn delicious!   I opted to try the Chicken and Mac n' Cheese Waffles. Yup, you read that right! The boneless-fried Chicken is AMAZING. The breaded outside and juice inside?! Very flavorful! The waffles too, were very different and tasty to dip into their house made syrup! Seriously theeeee best chicken and waffles I've ever had- possibly the best in Henderson! Wootwoot!   I usually like to try a place once, and then continue on to other business so that I can try a new place every time- but The Stove is a place I don't mind returning to visit. This place is the real deal y'all! Come on in!",

We were the only people waiting to be seated - there were maybe 5 other parties already settled into their seats and many open tables. We waited 10+ minutes before we were seated.   Water glasses had particles floating in them. The waiter was annoyed that I asked for a clean glass of water. He dumped out my glass and refilled it - dude, I don't want the same glass dirty water was in. As he poured new water I looked in the pitcher and saw the white stuff floating inside the water I pointed it out (politely) and he rolled his eyes.   After all of that. I thanked him for taking care of it and we ordered drinks. Then he came around for our orders and we asked for recommendations. My friend said she was really excited to try a specific dish and he told her to order something else because it was really not good and he didn't know why it was 'soo popular, ew'. She ordered it anyway and enjoyed it. I ordered a couple things for us to try but wasn't impressed. The rude service and dirty water really tarnished this place for me.",

    "text": "The Stove is insta-worthy cute, the menu items sounded fun, but the execution kinda fell flat. Here's the lowdown ~  Definitely make a reservation. This place is packed, and it was super easy to call a couple days before to skip the wait 25 min wait for Sunday brunch.   I love spicy and sweet drinks, but the Holla-Berry cocktail didn't quite hit the spot. It was more like a weak punch with jalapeno juice, definitely all sweet and no spice. I'm not trying to get fucked up for Sunday brunch, but I wanna feel a liiil' buzz at $12 a drink, 'nam sayin? On the other end of the scale, the Mimosa Float looked like 95% champagne and 5% orange juice. Tread carefully.  Salmon Benedict was not something I'd opt for again. The salmon was fishy, the English muffin was too big, and the hollandaise didn't stand out. But those potatoes were seasoned beautifully. If they were crispy, they'd be perfection. Also the poached eggs were over easy, I ain't mad but I know that's not everyone's thing.  To finish up, we had the birthday pancakes to share. The toppings and sprinkles definitely make this pancake, because they were definitely too dry. But seeing as it's mostly a vehicle for the berries, the small mountain of house-made whipped cream, and whole lotta sprinkles, it was still delicious. With syrup and butter, you probably wouldn't notice, but it's definitely an area they could improve upon.  Overall, The Stove has some details to iron out, but it was an okay experience and I'm sure once they find their footing they could be a great brunch spot.",

Another new menu item: champagne bongs for that special day out with your brunch crew! They also have a fun photo booth set up to top your visit off.

    "text": "4 1/2 star review. But ultimately, the food earned themselves that extra half star.  This whole online reservation wait-list option was glitchy. Since I'm old school and have trust issues with technology, I decide to call directly. Hostess said she will put me on the waiting list (this was on a Saturday for 11:30am).  Arrived on time and my bf and I had to wait about 10-15 minutes. Waiting area is small and cramped. If you have a party of 4 or more, please don't all congregate in this area; there will be no room.  Service was average. Had to repeat our requests a few times. This restaurant isn't that new anymore, they should have gotten their customer service down by now. But...my bf said they're just overwhelmed with the amount of tables and how busy they are.   We ordered the following items: *Sausage Corndog. Comes with three per order. I would've gotten two orders of this as my entree. YUM!!!!! *Bacon Pancakes. Bf order this....he said it's good but be prepared to be in a food coma because you're eating carbs on carbs on carbs. *I ordered the Chorizo Frittata and OMGGGGG......my ideal breakfast/brunch item! There's chorizo, manchego, roasted tomatoes, greens on top. This was big enough for two more leftover servings the next few days!  Also ordered an iced lavender coffee with creamer. Perfect pep and flavoring!   Not sure why all of a sudden everyone is all about \"brunching.\" Maybe it's those basic IG peeps but whatever it is, this is a solid brunch restaurant. I wouldn't go out of my way JUST to come here as there are PLENTYYYYYY of other really solid brunch restaurants around the city. But I still enjoyed it very much. Just wish they work out the whole reservation situation.",

They don't take reservations unless it's a party of 8 or more, and the high tea section is only available by reservation as well. The restaurant is not that big so the waitlist can be long. I would say it was worth the 40 min wait for brunch specially for the experience. I ordered the chilaquiles which were good but I thoroughly enjoyed their cinnamon roll, that is one to try!!! They offer bottomless mimosas for $18, the peace mimosa was great! I'll definitely be back and would love to try the high tea!",

The second time we were told 10 min wait and waited closer to 45 min, when we were finally seated the hosts were unorganized and after being seated it was obvious by the way we were treated that it was going to be a very long wait for service, having ask the table next to us how long they had waited just for their drinks which was not completed. If you are not a 20 something with a lot of time to kill or obvious friends with the staff don't bother trying to eat here",

We did wait a bit longer than I expected for the food to come out, but the staff was very good about refilling water and bringing us extras when we asked  Wait time - very long. They can't help that they're busy though. Join the wait list on their website before you leave home if there is 10+ people on the list. Also we noticed that there were several tables left empty for 30+ minutes even though there were 20 parties on the list.  Atmosphere - it's cute and looks like something you'd see someone hashtag on Instagram. We loved the cookie jars. It was extremely loud in there. My mom was 3 feet away and I could barely hear her. It's not their fault, just we aware. They do have a little booth with hats and props that will send you a 3 photo Gif for free. Helps pass the time.   Location - it's upstairs but they do offer an elevator. Parking is really tight, but Kneaders is closed on Sunday so you can park there and walk a little. There is very little room to wait. They offer a few sofas to sit on while you wait.   I'd come again, but on a less busy day.",

Took my order and everything and fine. But when i got my food, for some reason i had to wait for my change. Gave her the money BEFORE getting my food and waited around 10-15. That was okay, pretty quick in my opinion. But in the entire time i waited she stood in front of me with the cash tray right next to her. But proceeded to go do other task.  When i waited about 5 minutes AFTER getting my food, i asked for my change, which i got a smart reply of. \"Yeah I'll get it soon, its only a few dollars.\"  I still want my money so i can leave. Its still my money after all. No matter how little.  Then the waitress proceeds to continue to do other tasks until the moment she gave me my change. In which she just tossed a random amount of change on to the counter in front of me, with the right dollar amounts. Proceeded to say nothing even when i said thank you.   All in all. Waitress sucks, but the food is good. I recommend getting takeout besides dealing with the annoyed waitress. Didnt know getting change became such a task that you gotta make me wait and give me attitude when i just wanna leave after getting my food.",

    "text": "What happened to this place?! When we put ourselves on the waitlist online, we got no text confirmation, when we called in they told us you have to check in person? So why have an online waitlist to begin with? We got there and the hostess told us it would be another 20 min waiting (keep in mind at this point already an hour of waiting since online check in). She told me she would text me, we left and came back with no text reply. They almost seated the table we'd been waiting for an hour and a half at that point. The service from the servers and hostesses were god awful, lots of nasty looks and just all around unkind demeanors, my girlfriend and I felt uncomfortable with the service from the beginning. Our starter arrived incredibly late, it was the new food item Empanada, we had to return it. It honestly without exaggeration tasted like 7/11 taquitos. At that point the main dishes weren't arriving and it was taking so long we decided to leave. I used to really enjoy coming here, I used to love both the food and service when they opened, they are near my home and were my go to brunch place. I will never go back after this experience and I say that with confidence",

Lovely views over the city as its upstairs. Our server, Collin, was fantastic, checked in often, and made great recommendations.  I got a lavender iced latte with almond milk and it has the perfect amount of lavender in it without tasting like I had eaten a sprig of it. I got the bacon pancakes with a side of house potatoes and used the vanilla chamomile syrup and it was all delicious. My girlfriend got the french toast which is flavored with orange zest and a side of bacon, both of which were also great. Totally wanna go back and try those brie pancakes!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, we just moved here and both my husband and I are breakfast junkies. First let me say, this isn't the environment for children. Came here with our 8 month old although they didn't say anything, they didn't interact with the child and the hostess asked if we wanted a kids menu. He literally looks like an infant - that should've been a clue - that and the fact that it took her 5 mins just to get a high chair that seemed to be all the way in the back of the kitchen/restaurant. I'm guessing not a lot of kids go there.  To the FOOD;  The Pecan Maple Cinnamon Roll is delicious and not overly sweet at all. They pour the warm pecan icing right in front - still steamy. Yum!  The Crabby Patty Eggs Benny- ok I may be over critical cause I'm from Alaska and we do seafood best up there but this \"King Crab\" was the saltiest crab I have ever - in my life, tasted. And I've had a galore of crab dishes. The waiter, bless his heart tried to tell me that King Crab tends to be salty - this I know honey but the salt content of the crab was like sticking your whole face - with your mouth open in the ocean right at the beach. AND there were crab shells in it. Come on! Salmon Benny - same deal, the salmon was salty. We get its smoked salmon - trust us Alaskans we know. But it does not need to be this salty.  We're both breakfast cooks. That's how we met. Every chef/cook should know - if your meat is salty DON'T OVER SALT THE DISH. Sadly ate the dish around the crab (which is what makes the dish so expensive right). Well - waiter didn't offer a solution nor did he seem to care. 3 stars for the bomb cinnamon roll. Oh well, on to the next breakfast spot.",

When you're at The Stove, you're at home.  Relax, take your time, there's no rush here.  And you'll need time to enjoy all the fantastic choices on the menu!  Our visit was time for a large family visit, so we picked some appetizers to get started while looking over the meal choices.  Grilled peaches, short rib empanada, a pastry basket (already cut for sharing).  Of course, we indulged with bottomless mimosas.  And forget about simple orange juice, you want bottomless for the sake of trying the multitude of flavor choices - all made from fresh fruit.  My wife and I loved the hibiscus and watermelon best, but it was not easy to choose, it took lots of sips to decide.  Likewise, we had fun sharing each other's main dishes, but we have to go back another time to hit the parts of the menu we didn't cover.   We highly recommend saving room for dessert.  We indulged with the tableside bananas foster, nothing short of amazing!  And best served with 8-10 spoons to share.  The best part of visiting The Stove is the food, it's why we come - to eat.  But it becomes an experience, thanks to the staff and management, and the fun, relaxed, family vibe that exists here.  Thank you to Antonio and the entire crew for a wonderful visit, we look forward to sharing brunch with you again!",

The yogurt is fluffy and just sweet enough. The strawberry compote they use in it was delicious, made in the restaurant, but just a little too sweet so next time order half as much. Berries fresh and sweet, granola very tasty.  The ham was smoky, moist and tender. Delicious! Someone at the table next to us got chicken fried steak, which I was very jealous of! It looked amazing. I asked her and she said it was the best she's had, so can't wait to go back and try it for myself.  They were completely out of ice tea, but that's OK. The environment was adorable, service was great and food was fresh and so delicious so they still get a 5-star!  They have a really cute photo booth, but they were adding some finishing touches to it so we couldn't use it. Looking forward to going back and using it to take some fun selfies.",

    "text": "Worst Tea Experience Ever! We all had the worst tea experience ever! Our waitress was horrible she didn't  explain the tea at all my niece asked if she could just get a croissant and a tea and the waitress said she would have to charge us $9.00 for a whole pot of tea instead of just a cup. Four of us got the tea but the waitress said we were only allowed 2 pots of tea on the table. No Devon-shire or Clotted  cream I've never been to a tea without Devon shire cream ever. The waitress had a terrible attitude and clearly didn't want to be there and she was awful at explaining the teas. The four of us who did order tea got our food later than the other two people who were smart enough not to order the tea. Other tables had their food way before us. I thought there would be an assortment of sandwiches but we just had cucumber and the scones and cake were very dry. My daughter ordered the tea with the charcuterie board and because she is a vegetarian she brought the meat and cheese in two separate bowls. The whole tea experience was the worst I've ever had and two of the people who were there had never been to a tea and because I was hosting I felt horrible by this. This was supposed to be a college graduation get together with my daughters cousins, we drove 45 minutes from Summerlin. Drive was not worth it! I emailed the restaurant hoping they would get back to me before I posted this review clearly they could care less.",

    "text": "This restaurant has decent food, although very inconsistent. The service is unacceptable. The wait times are hours often times with empty tables around waiting to be bussed. The servers seem not to care and come around infrequently acting like they are doing you a favor and it's a hardship to come over to take your order. It's upsetting to order a pastry basket and have them give you halves of everything. Like who is eating the other half and why can't I have it if I ordered it? I've never seen any restaurant do that. Like did the server take a bite out of everything ? It's not like the pastries are that large or anything. That really bothered me. It takes a very long time for the food to arrive. My daughter had a hot chocolate with whipped cream and cotton candy. After the pastries and with our utensils covered in sticky chocolate, our server told me to gather all these dirty utensils so we would have them for our main course. It was a sticky mess. I had to ask for a clean utensil and they rolled their eyes and appeared annoyed. My waffles finally came cold and soggy drenched in too much sugar. The server said she would microwave them. They were inedible. Meanwhile there were empty tables all around me filled with dirty dishes for most of the 2 hours I was there. Yet up front there continued to be line and a 1 hour wait. I have given this restaurant 3 tries and each time I leave very upset and vow never to go back. I just don't understand the lack of proper management and it's been open long enough they should be able to figure out a way to normalize wait times and efficiency because it otherwise would have potential. The food is also very inconsistent. We have had the chilaquiles ( which are good) and each time they are different. Same with the pancakes which were great the first time with whipped cream and fresh fruit and not good the last time with a dry and different consistency and they simply forgot the whipped cream fresh fruit garnish. It gets incredibly frustrating to wait so long and have food arrive that needs to be sent back. It's very disappointing because I thought initially the restaurant had a lot of potential and we need neighborhood restaurants like this.",

    "text": "I've eaten here twice. The first time was on a Sunday and it was very crowded, which tells me it's a very popular place. We waited for a while to finally be seated, which was understandable. The wait allowed us to focus on the decor and layout of the restaurant, which we agreed was very well done. Once seated our waiter was excellent. We were very impressed with the vertical herb garden and the way the herbs are used not only for cooking, but for plating the food. Very nice. My second visit was mid-week and we arrived early (11:30) for lunch hoping to avoid a long wait for a table. We were seated within 5 minutes and the place was already packed. I ordered a hamburger and my friend ordered a veggie burger. My hamburger was flavorful but the fries were limp and soggy. My expectations were that for $16, a hamburger and fries should be excellent. Here are my reasons for a 3 star rating. The service was very slow both in waiting for our food after we ordered, and in waiting for someone to clear the plates after we were finished eating. The restaurant was also very noisy which made it difficult to have a conversation. Despite this criticism my hopes are that things will improve with time and this restaurant will be very successful.",

    "text": "I would like to start off by saying the food  is delicious here. Doug was our server he was good informed us on how the food is cooked at a slower pace, so the wait did not bother us. Okay now for the reason of the 4 stars, the check in was quite annoying, they have all these people waiting to be seated in a very small area. There were plenty of clean tables, but kept us and about 10 other people crammed in by the entrance for at least 20 minutes. It was very hot in there they had a oscillating fan pointing at our table which was dirty you could actually see the dust hanging off of it. I ordered coffee which the first cup was great very hot the next cup was actually cold. I realize this is a new place that would be the reason for the running around, but not getting much done. I will give this place another try due to the fact that the food is really good and the decor is very cute.",

    "text": "So the restaurant overall is very cute the way it is decorated. The food was ok, wasn't horrible, tasted fine. Our server was very nice. The reason I'm giving it a 1 star is due to the hostess today. When we walked in 1 hostess stood there on her phone, never looked up or said hello. We were told a 15 min wait even though there were 3 open tables. Once we got seated, my mom and I were seated right next to the the hostess stand so we heard everything. Two girls came in and were told a 45 min wait and so they asked for a recommendation of places near by they could eat. The hostess told them there was a hooters down the road, even though there are other breakfast options available. Didn't offer them to have a coffee or drink to stay and wait. The two girls started walking out and a server had to go get them and  told them they could be seated right away. The hostess is the first interaction a customer receives when coming in and they were not friendly or welcoming.",

    "text": "I would give this zero stars if I could. My husband and I went there today at approximately 1:20pm. It's a Saturday so we expected a wait even though it was after 1:00pm. Happily we were seated within 15 minutes of our arrival. That was the only good thing that occurred on this visit. We were seated for 7 minutes before we were even acknowledged. Finally our server came over to us. My husband ordered water and I ordered ice tea. Seven minutes later he came back with water but no ice tea. I cancelled the ice tea and took water. We ordered Pecan Pie Pancakes and a Berry Special waffle. Thirty-two minutes later someone brings over food to our table. States Churro pancakes, no we had Pecan Pie pancakes. Oh, it's the table right next to us (they arrived at least 20 minutes after us). The server stopped at their table. No, it's not theirs either. Refilled their waters ( but not our empty glasses) and left without one word to us. By now we were there 46 minutes with the server barely acknowledging us. We got up and left (told the hostess as we didn't see the server). This is a new restaurant but there is no excuse for our poor service. We watched the restaurant and others were served faster. It's also very loud and noisy with no children there. Very disappointed for what was suppose to be a higher end brunch restaurant. Will not go back and do not recommend it.",

    "text": "I really hate giving this review because I love the food and don't want them to leave, HOWEVER...  Last weekend we went to the stove and chose not to wait the estimated 45 minutes to 1 hour since the person at the desk was very non-committal on how long it would actually be.  There were not a lot of people waiting and she told us it was because they have an online waitlist and people from the waitlist have priority over walk-ins.  She suggested that in the future, we go on-line and add our name to their waitlist.  Then we would be notified when we should come in for little or no wait.  \"GREAT\", we thought.  We'll do that next time.  So today, I added my name to their waitlist at 11AM.  I was the 23rd name on the list and the 4th party of 2.  I checked the list every 15 or 20 minutes and at one point I had moved up to 13th in line but then later found I had fallen back to 15th.  I have no idea how this happens, but it did twice.  After I moved up to 10th, I dropped back to 13th.  I was consistently behind 3 other parties of 2.  After 2 1/5 hours, none of the parties of 2 had been removed from the list.  At the 3 hour point, I was at the top of the list, probably because the people ahead of me gave up,  but I was NEVER notified that a table was ready.  After 3 1/2 hours, I was still at the top of the list.   I'd really like to hear from the restaurant about how this happens.  Obviously, the wait list is a joke.  Can't they at least let you know that they have no intention of seating you?  It shows a complete lack of respect for customers.  Not everyone can wait the amount of time it takes to get seated.  At some point, people may be tired of waiting and move on toe the next \"hot\" restaurant.  You may come to regret treating customers like you don't need them.  That's how I feel now.  Because of the good food, I have told a lot of people to visit The Stove and I have brought friends there.  Obviously, it's easier to get in during the week.  I understand you can be too busy to accommodate every one.  Just be honest and don't let people hanging on a waitlist and then never even contact them.  There should also be a way to take yourself off the waitlist.  There is not.",

When they arrived they were not even luke warm. We battled over sending them back, and ended up asking for new ones. The new lattes were still not warm.   We then waited for 45 minutes for our food to come out, and at this point the morning rush was over the restaurant had begun to empty out so there was no reason for the wait.. we finally got our entrees. They were completely cold. My croque madame came with soggy bread, so I believe our food was just sitting. We didn't say anything as we just wanted to eat. The food did taste good. We then received our appetizer we ordered after our meals.. slightly annoying.  It's just hard to give positive reviews on a restaurant with the food and beverages in the state we received them. Definitely willing to adjust my review and give a second chance, just maybe won't sit on the patio so we aren't forgotten.",

She came out and said \"The bathrooms are dirty. They didn't clean up from the night before. The trash was overflowing from the bin. The TP roll was empty but a roll was sitting on the tank.\" I looked around our table and saw the floor had built up grime under the neighboring table. The table was also missing its laminate edging in several places. The wall had screws where pictures once hung. There's that creepy feeling; \"How dirty is the kitchen?\" \"Should I stay or should I go now\"! The food arrived. The plates were cool/funky and CLEAN? Maybe, maybe not.

    "text": "Came to this new chef driven restaurant off Eastern in Henderson that used to be our local location for the infamous Firefly Spanish Tapas restaurant.  If you like Kitchen Table (one of the owner/chefs is from there) then you're going to love this spot.  Met up with a few friends and we all chose different menu items.  Two of my friends decided to get afternoon tea service while me and another friend ordered regular menu items.  I ordered \"Dem fancy eggs\" and it came out with a wonderful smokey presentation.  Once they lift the lid off, you can smell and see the smokey flavor wafting up in the air.  My friends said the tea service was good, as well as the story behind all the cups and plates used.  Basically, they were all bought out from a collector of antique tea ware so don't be off put if your plateware doesn't match up, as it is done on purpose.  Ask your server, if you're getting tea service, of the story and you will appreciate more the cups and plates being used.  My other friend said that his muffalatta sandwich was good as well as their sausage corn dogs.  The only thing I will say to the management of this establishment is that they really should offer reservations for brunch/breakfast because it is insanely busy and waiting 1.5 hours for a table is not fun.  They do offer reservations for the tea service side where you can also order the full menu however someone must get the tea service in your party in order to sit on that side of the restaurant.  This is what we did in order to circumvent the long wait.  Oh, please get new tables on the tea service side as the old re-used \"bottle service\" type of tables do not go well with your food driven concept.",

We arrived at 11:15am and there was only one person in front of us in line and were told the the wait would be 20-25mins. Even though we saw 3 empty tables that could have fit us. We waited patiently. 10 mins later. We saw a guest leave one table but nobody came to clean it for 20 mins. Then the host told us she was going to sit us there, she just needed to clean it first. Not joking she sat us at a table that was empty for 30mins. We sat down at 12pm. We waited 45 mins for a table that was empty for 30 mins. When we sat we waited another 5 mins to order. And we tried to order our food immediately but was told that the food would still take 30-35 mins to come out because they make there food \"fresh\". Because we had an appointment at 1 we decided it wasn't worth waiting longer for and left. When we told them we were leaving and why, they didn't care and just said ok. Like it didn't matter. They really didn't care about our time or the fact that we were with a baby. It would have been nice to try the food since we drove 30 mins from mountains edge to try it but after waiting so long it didn't seem worth it.",

She tried to take his plate back and he told her no. He will eat it anyway. She then tried grabbing the plate and he said no, He never sends food back because people will spit in your food. She then stormed off and said she was so offended, lol. The manager then came over and paid for our whole meal. That was awesome. Gotta love this place. Thank you for the breakfast.

However, then we had to wait another 20 minutes for water our  waitress took our drink order and we didn't see drinks for another 25 minutes. Owner of the restaurant explained there's only 1 bartender on even though this restaurant was packed with people. Watched many people walk out. We stuck with it, very pretty room, pretty food, but couldn't eat the avocado on the avocado sandwich because it was hard as a rock. Rest of the food was mediocre at best.  This restaurant really has to work out its kinks. The kitchen and the bar are killing the servers here. We did have our meal comped. But what a complete waste of time.

    "text": "We tried the place yesterday.   I was excited to try this much hyped brunch place in Henderson.  They have a online list you need to get yourself on if you want to eat there and get seated in under an hour.  Even then it took 2.5 hours on the list to be seated which waiting at home wasn't the worst thing because it's so trendy right now.  But the food and drinks were very slow in coming.  We had appetizers, champagne cocktails and and entree and it was a 2 hour meal which was just too long.  Additionally it was very loud and worse it was too warm in the restaurant.  The AC can't keep up with the hot vegas summers...   I brought the kids because of the unicorn hot chocolate and that was very good and the kids enjoyed that.  The food is plated very elegantly and they get 5 stars for plating.  Unfortunately to food taste was not up to par. My father in law and I both had the crabby patty Benedict and we both felt it was below average.  The Benedict sauce was tasteless and the crab portion of it was tiny and overly salty.  My wife had the suckling pick Benedict and again the sauce was bland.  The suckling pig was on the dry side as well.  The appetizers were only ok... As for the cocktails, I was very disappointed in the creamsicle.   The island Champaign was decent however.   Overall I think the place is just overhyped for very average tasting food at an above average price.",

Went back again today. 1/3 full. Noticed that several of the items disappeared from the menu. Maybe a good thing to solve the kitchen issues?  Don't really know. Do know my wife's favorite is gone. Oh well, it happens. Problem is it hasn't solved either of the problems. Took forever to get eggs and ham. Overheard the tables next to us complaining they were there 25 minutes before us and still had no food.   Can't say I've had a bad meal from a food perspective...just disorganized kitchen and waitstaff. Expected more!  Also removed salt and pepper from the tables. Don't ask for any...the waitstaff will just take your order back to the kitchen?  The prices aren't Denny's. They need to provide a better experience.

    "text": "This is my second time here. So this is reviewing both visits.  the first experience: was HORRIBLE! The food was extremely salty that I couldn't even eat my meal. I ordered the Chilaquiles and my husband ordered the Country Fried Steak, and both had so much salt that they were NOT even edible. I asked my husband to taste mine, then I tasted his; we both agreed the food overall was horridly salty; could not even taste any of the flavors of our food because our tongues were numb from the extreme saltiness!  we decided to give it another chance thinking maybe we caught the restaurant on a bad day, which by the way should never happen! You want to serve customers with the best quality food... but that was not the case with our 1st and 2nd experience.  Second time: I ordered the Crabby Patty Benedict because it had good reviews on yelp, BUT it was more like a cream cheese Benedict with a smidge of crab. It was served with ONLY ONE piece of crab that was 1 inch (long) x .5 inch in thickness. I thought that there would be more crab underneath the egg, but it was all just cream cheese and sauce! And the sauce was still extremely salty! So disappointed!!  I only gave 1 star for the decor, but the food deserves ZERO stars!",

If you like pork carnitas / the meat is totally on par with the best taco you have ever had with this meat. Service was great. Cinnamon rolls - when you have a server that pours the hot white glaze over the roll - pretty awesome stuff.  Afternoon tea room area is awesome. Warning - be aware that items that are highly recommended on yelp are not always on the menu. The Mexican ice cream -  not available. That aspect would be my lone complaint. View is great. The place is so much better than kitchen table - blows us away. You actually get service there, are not waiting for crazy lengths of time.  Would totally recommend going to the Stove.",

I absolutely love the short rib empanadas and the birthday cake pancakes. If you go on a Sunday expect to wait at least an hour to be seated. The thing that really makes this my go-to brunch spot is the fact that they offer brunch and bottomless mimosas every day of the week. I don't know of any other places in Vegas that does that. Most places only offer a weekend brunch on Saturday and Sundays. I recommend trying this place out for sure! Just make sure to put your name on the waitlist if you plan on going during the weekend.",

Even asked for syrup but still didn't taste as appetizing. I ordered Mash Potatoes & Gravy on the side which was incredible and made up for the meal. I should have gone with the Banger instead.  Also had a strawberry mimosa which was great. Servers were helpful and friendly however went on a Thursday afternoon and wasn't many people and no wait and still the food took forever to get to us. We were only 2 people. I guess they were behind but it wasn't even full or crowded. It was disappointing watching everyone get their meals before us. The areas for picture taking are cute however not sure i'd come back. Wasn't worth the rave of what i've seen on social media.",

When it ran a little longer to get that table in the back, they didn't rush out those who were eating, they refilled our drinks gratis.   The food is excellent. French toast was on point.

    "text": "THE LOUDEST PLACE I'VE EATEN! I was really hyped to go to this place but the experience as a whole was pretty mediocre. Our server, Dalia, and the arugula salad were the best parts of the experience.  The pastry basket was half very good 1/2 not great. The Madelines, chocolate croissant, and chocolate chip muffin we're all very good. The scone and biscuit were dry and what was called jam was actually a liquid. (See pictures)   This was honestly one of the loudest places I have ever eaten in my entire life and that includes Buffalo Wild Wings. It was so loud that it was uncomfortable. Our waitress did warn us ahead of time that our food would take a considerable length of time to be delivered however we were pleasantly surprised at arrived in only 10 minutes.   The presentation is very impressive and it all looks very upscale and fresh. However because my plate was so artistic the shape of it was not good for eating off of and I had to chase my sauce the entire time because it tried to run off of the lowered parts of my glass plate. (See pictures)   I was not at all impressed with my meal. I ordered the suckling pig eggs Benedict. I have to admit this was something out of my comfort zone so that definitely may be part of my lack of appreciation. (My husband said the hollandaise on mine was delicious) However I would never eat it again. My husband ordered the croque madame.  It was covered in something we could not identify and it was only in after the meal that we were finally able to get an answer that it was a carmelized butter onion cream. He said it was good but again nothing impressive enough to make him return.   The unicorn hot chocolate was very pretty and fun with its mound of glitter sprinkled cotton candy on top. The hot chocolate itself was just average hot chocolate however it was topped with full size marshmallows which was pretty cool. Unfortunately paper straws do get soggy pretty quickly especially in a hot liquid and trying to drink from the cup while surrounded with all of that decorative chocolate and sprinkles is a little difficult.  The place was pretty clean and the decor is very cute. I would definitely give it an a for decor and presentation. Our server, Dalia, was also very friendly and accommodating.",

    "text": "Stove is the new go to breakfast spot in Henderson for me. I haven't seen this much business in here since the days of Firefly. I fully expect them to open up for dinner once they've established their core customers.   I'll admit, they messed up my order, but the quality of food, customer service, decor, and the fact that the owner is busting his ass on the floor with his staff makes this place worth 5 stars.   I ordered the traditional farmhouse breakfast, sunny side up eggs, jalapeno bacon, sourdough toast, and of course bottomless mimosas. In my honest opinion I would've liked to have seen the breakfast potato's more well done.   Best feature of Stove is the rotating scent of their bathrooms. You're probably wondering at this point what I mean, huh?  When I used the restroom I smelled bacon. When my friend used the restroom he smelled pancake batter. That's awesome!!!",

    "text": "Our original plan was come here for a girls high tea birthday celebration but called about a week prior to find out they no longer offer high tea due to low demand .  We figured that's ok let's do brunch and wear our little hats anyway!  Our group of 5 came in and was seated in the back room along the window.  This restaurant was hard for me to find as it's located on the 2nd floor but it does have some nice views.  I tried to order a coffee with Baileys but was told they don't serve anything over a certain ABV content.  I decided to go with the suggested blackberry mimosa and for my entree I went for the empanada and matcha French toast.  The blackberry mimosa was crisp and light, but I really wished they had a coffee drink with some \"oomph\" in it (unless I missed this on the menu)  Our table shared the deviled eggs which were really good and I don't usually care for deviled eggs.  The matcha French toast was very light and it too sweet and the empanada was pretty good also, i needed something savory to go with the French toast.    We had a great time, food was good but not being a big breakfast person maybe I'll come back for lunch Instead if I'm in the area.    Don't miss the photo booth room on the way out...soo fun!",

Only complaint was that service was super duper slow. If you want something under 30 minutes, you might not want to come here. We were here close to 1.5 hours.",

Too many things to list that I found extremely frustrating. It just reminds me of a very talented chef starting a restaurant with no clue how to manage staff.   I will say that the food was excellent which is why I gave an extra star. The staff is all friendly and smile but they have no idea how to be professional staff in a restaurant. I blame the front end manager (if there is any). Nobody has been trained. Again amateur hour. If you want to put up with that the food is excellent.",

    "text": "So I have been hearing some good things about this place! We decided to try it out on a Monday thinking it would not be too busy. Well, we were wrong! We ended up having to wait about 30 minutes for a table at lunch but it was worth it. I was unaware that you could call in to be placed on the waitlist ahead of time but now I know for the future.  This is not a large place but more intimate and cozy. From some angles, the restaurant offers a great view of the valley and mountains. In addition they feature a High Tea as well which I need to check out!  We were seated at the next available table and then our server came over and introduced herself. She also let us know that she was in training. You sure could not tell as she was fantastic and stayed on top of our service the whole time. Sorry i cannot remember her name!   I had been craving a grilled cheese and tomato soup lunch for weeks. I was so happy to see this was a listed entree. Two of us enjoyed the Roasted Tomato soup and Grilled Cheese sandwich while my other friend opted for the Avocado Toast. For starters, we loved the Short Rib Empanada which was recommended by our server as a hit! It was definitely melt in your mouth goodness and the poblano chilies provided just the right amount of heat. Then our entrees arrived. This grilled cheese was no ordinary grilled cheese. The added shimji and trumpet mushrooms took this sandwich to the next level in terms of taste. On top of the sandwich was a little arugula with a little vinaigrette which just made this meal a five star experience for me.   After lunch, we just had to have some fun in the photo booth too!  All of us were extremely pleased with our meals and the service. In addition, we enjoyed some fabulous live music from Mike on guitar. I asked him how we got so lucky to hear him. He explained that Mondays are called Industry Mondays for those that work in hospitality. Just another star for this place in my book as I am always a fan of live music on any day at any hour.  Although this establishment is no where near where I live, I will still make the drive again to enjoy more their yummy dishes!",

Great fruit puree to add to your champagne. I had the mango, my other friends had the raspberry and peach.. All good! I ordered the eggs benedict, probably the best looking EB I've ever had, and the taste, matched the presentation. Fluffy poached eggs on top of shaved ham and a thick English muffin topped with real hollandaise sauce. Definitely homemade sauce, not from a starter or a can.  Next time someone suggests breakfast, I'm suggesting The Stove. Looking forward to coming back real soon!",

    "text": "I came all the way from Centennial to brunch here because my friends absolutely raved about it. We agreed to meet at 11 am so I put our names in online at 10:30. Upon arriving at 11 I was told there would be at least another 30 minute wait. We decided to sit for awhile and when we saw a few spots open up at the bar and we proceeded to go ahead and sit there and order our unlimited mimosas prior to getting our seats. There were 4 of us and I paid for all 4 which came to just under $100.00 after tip. As we started talking, a young bartender with red hair and a man bun told us that the bar seating was for patrons who were dining only. There were no signs and the hostesses suggested twice that we could go to the bar. I asked the bartender that even though I just dropped $100 that I was being asked to vacate my seat. He quite obnoxiously said yes. Had he been slightly more apologetic, it would have been easier to take but he was extremely rude. We ended up wandering around with our glasses as well as the glasses that contained the puree for the mimosas AS well as a large container that held more champagne.  Are you kidding me?? We finally got a seat approximately an hour after arriving. The food was exquisite.  I ordered the Banger and it was absolutely tasty and amazing. Truly the best I've had. My order actually came out much later than my friend's orders and they took it off the bill without asking. So a small cuddos to them for that. My friends ordered the short rib omelet,  the egg white frittata and crab omelet. Everyone was greatly satisfied with their order. Oh wait, the one item that my cousin ordered was deviled eggs as an appetizer. This particular dish came with four egg halves with different toppings. One was traditional and I ate that. It was way over salted. One came with caviar on top, which I am attributing to the $15 price tag. My cousin kept gagging after he put it in his mouth. Would definitely not recommend that particular appetizer. The mimosas were excellent with various flavors. Our waiter did his best but was definitely burdened with a ton of tables. Overall the experience was pleasant because of the company and excellent food, however the obnoxious bartender really made the start incredibly awkward and frustrating. I'm not quite sure I'd make the trip again with so many other brunch options in Vegas with better tempered staff.",

I had the savory French toast which was delicious! My Mom's chorizo frittata was really good & not at all oily like some chorizo things often are - it was perfect & flavorful but not spicy. My dad had pancakes which were also really good with a hint of some other flavor I couldn't quite identify but liked very much as well as the texture. Yum! It's a beautiful restaurant with great decor and a stunning view. It's really too bad they are only open for breakfast and lunch, because I imagine the view at night must be incredible! They do a \"proper tea\" here too, and my mom & I are looking forward to coming back to try that soon. The only drawback here is that it is VERY noisy inside.",

He took our drink orders which came out 30 mins later, which seemed to be a little long for bottomless mimosas which are served in a large craft with sides of juice. Then food slowly trickled out.... with missing parts. 3 BLTS were ordered with 2/3 missing the tomato of the BLT and A poached egg on an eggs Benedict cooked like a hard boiled egg and a corn beef that was drier than beef jerky (weird when they said they don't send food out \"perfect\") But my chiliquilies was good! lol basically go super early and have plentyyyyy of time to spare for the incredibly slow service!",

We had the deviled eggs and empanadas to start. We also had the duck monte Cristo which was the best, the chilaquiles, crab Benedict, and country Benedict. The service was terrible and that is why I'm giving it a 4 star. Marco was not personable and seemed impatient. But , it was a very fun atmosphere.",

Nothing was held back to make this place look fantastic and so inviting. The decor and modern design is pleasing to the eye while the food is pleasing to my belly! They have a cute little photo booth which is absolutely brilliant for social media and free advertising! The baked goods are incredible and I'm a pure carbaholic so i was in heaven! To make everything even more wonderful is their vegan menu! Being able to get vegan eggs and cheese is a complete score! Scott and Antonio have gone all out to have a beautiful and tasty restaurant. Very well done gentleman! We will definitely be frequent guests! A social eatery at its finest!",

A second story breakfast spot in a busy, tiny, strangely laid out shopping center had put me off from coming here for awhile, but after a few persistent suggestions from friends, I knew it was a must try. My only hope that it would live up to the hype and be worth the nightmare parking.  I certainly believe it did. While the restaurant looks small from the outside, the inside is well lit and set up in a way that makes it easy to move around. The decor is super cute, and they've even got their own miniature wall garden set up in the corner.  The menu is pretty short compared to most breakfast spots, but are very unique. They offer dishes that are uncommon here in the US, but popular in other countries. while they have your typical flapjacks and bacon, they also offer chiquilies, shashuka, \"bangers\" and eggs, etc.  I ordered the the Monte Cristo sandwich to try something new, it was pretty much a ham and swiss sandwich deep-fried in pancake batter. Weird combo. Totally kickass.   So whether you just want a simple breakfast spot or want to be adventurous and try some new food, definitely a great breakfast spot.",

I stick to a gluten-free lifestyle, and The Stove's menu made is pretty easy to stick to.   Downs: From the time we sat down to the time we actually got our breakfast was about 45 minutes to an hour. So many tables were empty, so I'm not sure why the wait time was so extreme. My Crabby Patty Benedict was cold and the hollandaise sauce was piled on top even though I asked for it to be on the side.  There was a weird smell every time a server opened the kitchen door to go to the back. Due to the slow service, our server comped my friend's mimosa but didn't offer to comp anything for me. Not cool.   All in all, this place is cute if you want a leisurely brunch with friends. IMO it's a bit hyped up, so I'm not sure when I'll be back.",

From the ambiance being welcoming, to the warm welcome from the staff, to the open concept kitchen, the overall feel is laid back and homey.   I started with the Lavender iced coffee, a bit strong on the floral notes, but otherwise quite good. My boyfriend and I shared the pastry plate, and for the price it was fantastic. My boyfriend got the waffle poutine and he said it was like he had in Canada, eh. I had the Chilaquiles, robust flavors that all just melted in your mouth. The portions were not dainty either, kudos to the chefs for not succumbing to the \"tiny portion\" brunch mentality. We will definitely be back to try more of their awesome looking menu.",

The problem I had was our poor waiter had a table top of ten and then our table of six. The table of ten had been there a while but their party trickled in until they were all there. Unfortunately, this meant they were ready to order right as we were seated. It took about 15 minutes to get a regular cup of coffee which I never got a refill on. As far as the decor, I love it. Great view also! I really liked how the food prep would perfect every plate up front on a gorgeous table. The menu was crazy cool. This is why I follow them in Instagram. So many cool flavor combinations. I love the concept of the hangover corn dog but it wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping. The mini salad on the plate was amazing though! The chicken and waffles plate was good. I really enjoyed the presentation and the spicy maple syrup. The waffles left me a bit disappointed. I was really expecting mac-&-cheesy waffles. I saw a noodle in a few parts but it really had no cheese flavor at all. I really love the menu option to get 1 specialty pancake for $5. I got the pecan pie pancake. I was happy it wasn't overly sweet. I would say the crabby patty was probably the most impressive item ordered. The poached egg was cooked to perfection. The crab was fresh and delicious. It was a very rich breakfast meal but wonderfully paired with all of its flavors. All in all I do hope to go back and try the avocado toast, one of the many tea lattes, the bananas foster tableside pancakes, and the monte cristo.",

    "text": "What can I say?  We've found our new go-to brunch spot!  Our server, Marco, was polite, knowledgeable and quick.  The hostess, chef, and who I assumed was either the manager or owner came by our table and asked how everything was and even spent a little time getting to know us, welcomed us to the neighborhood and explained how some of the dishes were prepared.  The food was spectacular.  Excellent blend of sweet and savory, perfect portions and very tasty.  Excellent presentation as well.  The atmosphere is great, clean and open.  The menu is on the slightly upscale, or adult side, but there are kid friendly options as well.  In every aspect, a terrific experience!",

    "text": "Ate their yesterday for brunch and \"bottomless\" mimosas (2-hour limit, which might sound strict but honestly, you totally get your money's worth for $19). I ordered the chicken and waffles with spicy maple syrup, and it was probably the best I've ever had. The spice level on the syrup was just perfect for me, and I'm a bit of a wimp. The service was fantastic! Our server had a warm but unintrusive personality and she was spot on with her menu recommendations-- the empanadas made this anti-black-bean eater a convert.   My one tiny suggestion is that the table needed placemats, because the plates tended to slip when I was cutting my food and I very nearly spilled a drink because of it. Once I put a napkin under the plate it was great.   Can't wait for the mimosa garden to open.",

    "text": "The Stove is such a great brunch spot in Henderson with a clear view of the Las Vegas strip. The restaurant is all upstairs and they do have an elevator as well. With a massive menu, you won't see the typical diner options such as bacon & eggs or an omelette. What you will find are creatively crafted dishes tailored for breakfast or lunch meals. They also offer alcohol for a boozy brunch and their coffee mugs are huge. Free refills for drip coffee. What I was most interested in was their vegan menu, although small compared to the rest of the menu, it has great offerings. My favorite was the vegan benedict. Complete with a tofu scramble and dripping with vegan butter, it was a delicious high fat meal. Many of their items come with \"greens\" which is a small salad. The waiter listed some ingredients in it since we loved it so much and he did name honey. If you avoid honey I would ask for clarification on the salad that comes with the vegan dishes. Other items that are delicious are the vegan skillet and the vegan chicken burrito. The chicken was so realistic that I asked what brand they use. Beyond meat comes through with the delicious chicken for this meal. The manager said they will be making their own vegan meats in the future, which is awesome.",

    "text": "I would give less of a review if i could. We put in a reservation for 5 ppl at 9am. Waitlist said 1hr 15m. We arrived, waited for another 15 min, which is fine. Hostess came to collect us for our table, the 5 of us, and walked us to a 4 top table. We expressed we were 5 ppl, she replied \"you arrived With 4 and a child so we adjusted your reso to 4, it's going to be more of a wait for 5\". I expressed we made a reso for 5, we didn't adjust it to 4. She walked away leaving us at the table set for 4. We expressed we can just pull up a chair. She said we can't but we can pull up a high chair for the child. Confused, we waited at the table. She proceeded to get another group of 3 and seat them at the table we were standing.   We stood in the middle of the Resturant for another 15 min or so with zero communication as to what our seating arrangement would be. We are now 1.5hrs in on the waitlist and 30 min waiting in room. We finally flagged down the same hostess and she again expressed since we changed our reso from 5 to 4 and back to 5 they moved us back down the list and it would be a wait.  We expressed WE did NOT adjust our party size they did. At this point we decided to leave. On the way out the other hostess expressed that \"we are busy, sorry for the wait\".   Side notes    -there were 4 tables open in the main dining room and an entire room open with 7+ tables open on the other side of the Photobooth.  -we were a party that included a 2yr old as well as a 8mo pregnant woman.   They let us conjugate in the middle of their Resturant for 30 min as they sat ppl around us due to them changing our reso.   Will never be back. Place is fake busy. They create the wait to create s buzz.    Fail.",

The food menu was the perfect size and I ended up choosing the burger. It tasted absolutely delicious!   We did have a little mishap during our breakfast, but our server, the manager, and the owner all came out to make sure everything was okay AND to make up for everything, they took care of our meal and offered us to come back and dine for free. They really went above and beyond to correct the issue and I couldn't have been more pleased with how all of the employees + management handled it all. I will be back a ton in the future, I'm sure, and I'll be sure to recommend The Stove as one of my new favorite breakfast places!",

We starting digging into the food as soon as it arrived- I didn't even get any pics! I had the BLT which was an odd choice for me but I devoured it immediately- it was soo good!! My husband had the BGR which he said was the best burger he ever had. My gf had the crab Benedict \"Crabby Patty\" and the English muffin was so delicious. We also had the short rib empanadas as an app, and a couple others at our table had huevos rancheros. We shared a bananas foster for dessert which is made tableside!  There is an adorable patio with a great view and some fun games. They grow their own micro greens inside under LED lights. They have a cute little photo booth and just so many little nooks and  crannies with gorgeous flowers, or art or what looks like flea mart finds.   Only bummer is we were given a high chair but our table was Super high so no way my daughter could have sat in it because the tabletop was about 18inches higher than the chair so she sat on our laps (no biggie). Also were never given a kids menu and I see now that the kids meals are served in cute little old school lunch boxes - which I would have wanted to see!   Overall beyond amazing and so happy when we find pretty new places with amazing food. Such a gem!",

    "text": "I am not going to give this place a poor review based on fact this is not my type of environment.  The food is really not my style and the atmosphere was not my typical crowd.  However......  We did have a reservation that was made approximately a week in advance.  I arrived first with my kids and wife.  The waiting area is very small and my family takes up almost the entire waiting area.  As some people came and went we had to shuffle around for them to get out of the door.  My mother and sister arrived next and this added to the congestion near the door area.  My two aunts arrived and then my brother and sisters-in-law, approximately 20 minutes past our reservation time.  After waiting another 15 minutes we were finally seated.  After being seated our drink orders were taken, again not my type of place I'm not a mimosa or champagne drinker or really any breakfast alcoholic beverage drinker.  Anyways waters came out for us, with the few in my groups other drinks.  The cups for water are smaller in size, and almost ever drink I took I finished my cup.    I ordered the Huevos Rancheros.  My wife got the Farmhouse, and my kids split a Birthday Pancake order.    Mine was served on little corn tortillas, the food was pretty good only thing I did not care for was the caramelized red onions.    My wife's Farmhouse, looked smaller than I thought it was going to be. She didn't like the biscuit that came with it, and the only jam was strawberry.    My kids had the best experience they thought the sprinkles and colors in the pancakes was awesome!  I will say this place is kid friendly and it's so loud in there my kids noise is drowned out and not a disturbance.  My kids were also able to get plastic cups to avoid breaking the glass ones everyone else got.  Funny thing is I think their cups were bigger than ours.    Waiter we had was professional and courteous.  He busted his butt and did a great job keeping water coming into my tiny cup!  My main downside was that from the time we ordered until the time everyone had their food was 1 hour and 10 minutes.  I understand we not the only people in the restaurant and we are a larger group, but an hour and 10 min, that's a long time to wait for food when you sat in the waiting room for an extended time too.  Now another thing I thought was a cool touch and brings the rating up in my book is bringing out a little dish with a few muffins and cookies on it.  There was a blueberry muffin, chocolate chip muffin, and a chocolate chip cookie.  All three were cut in half and placed in middle of the tables.    I honestly probably will not return just due to the fact that it's not really my style of place, not that I hated it, but that I'm just not into that environment.  Over food was good, service was good, waiting always sucks but it was overall positive experience chilling with my out of state family.",

    "text": "Big thanks to The Stove for letting me and some of my girls gather here for brunch as we sipped on our (endless) mimosas and yummy food! Walking into this place for a first time almost makes you forget you're in Vegas. It's really a hidden gem off the strip  and not over crowded by all the tourists coming in and out of town. We got seated right away, with a table that had a beautiful view of the strip. This place is located on the second floor of the building... the view is totally worth it.   What brought us in was the endless mimosas...on a Friday. Yep you heard it! Not many brunch places offer endless mimosas during the week so we were super excited to eat here on our day off. Their juices for the mimosas were mango, peach, strawberry, hibiscus and blackberry. Mango & peach were my favorite, along with the hibiscus.  I've always been a sucker for breakfast food, no matter what time of the day it is. Their menu is very modern & hipster, the usual breakfast fix-ins with a twist. I ordered the king crab Benedict... drool. They were not shy with the king crab!! The crab was buttery and served on top an English muffin and potatoes. And of course topped with homemade hollandaise sauce :)   Our server was very attentive and was always refilling our waters and pitcher of champagne! Definitely will be back to try something different on the menu.",

The menu looked amazing , so many  choices and variety of combinations ,I could not decide. I tried the avocado toast and my friend ordered the foigre  waffle. It took about 35 min to get out food but it was very tasty and I really enjoyed all the flavors of the avocado toast . The place is a hip breakfast spot like you would see at the strip , unique menus . I'll definitely be back to try other stuff on the menu because it all looked so good .    Cons : the shopping center it's in does not have enough parking to support the customers.  You will wait a while on a Sunday to get your food .",

As you walk in you see a cute porch where you can request to eat with guests, kind of like a private section. And then inside everything is just so eye catching. They have a fun photo booth, with cute tea party hats. And a bar with an open pastry area.  The server was really nice, I could tell she was busy since she was the only server on the floor. But she did a good job giving all her tables the attention they needed.  She notified us that appetizers and pastries will come out quickly but entrees will take about 20 minutes since everything is made to order.  For the appetizer we ordered deviled eggs and empanadas. Sorry don't know the names but the empanadas were delicious!! Such a unique taste within their recipes.   For my entree I ordered the chicken and waffles and my boyfriend ordered the duck macaroni and another duck dish with an over easy egg(duck Benedict?)  My daughter got a side pancake and sausages.  My chicken and waffles was delicious as well! The waffle had some kind of cheese in the inside that didn't take away from the sweetness that it should have. And the chicken was cooked perfectly to pair along with my waffles. The taste again was so unique. Not like any regular chicken and waffles.  I got to taste a bite of the duck macaroni and that was so delicious as well. My daughters side pancake was huge.. I wasn't expecting that.  And as I looked around, if she were to order a kids meal it would've been served in a cute tin lunch box.  Overall a great experience for lunch. Very unique. I definitely recommend and I would come back.",

Well appointed and still full of whimsy, though gimmicks such as a selfie-booth and \"Twisted\" Tea Room were smartly abandoned in favor of a focus on seasonality and customer service, guests will find comfort regardless of which room they are seated, while a recently updated menu features several new dishes alongside best-sellers ranging from simple Bacon and Eggs to Foie Gras atop Waffles.  Opting for a booth on the left-side looking in, at most times quieter than the primary dining room and even more so at 1:15pm, it was as a party of four that Breakfast began with Coffee, Cocktails and Pastries, the latter offered on a three-tier tower and highlighted by soft-centered Chocolate Chip Cookies plus fluffy Muffins given a touch of color amidst plenty of Blueberries and Butter.  Visiting the Restaurant for the first time with neither Scott nor Antonio present, a honey-soaked Salad of Peaches enjoyable despite sorely lacking for Nuts or Cheese compared to what @thestovelv shared on Social Media, it was on request that Empanadas were delivered in follow-up, the Short Rib expectedly tender and standing up nicely to two types of Chiles inside golden Pastry.  Henceforth focused on new items, though passing on Pecan Pie Pancakes is admittedly ill-advised, it was with serviceware re-set that grilled Bread Pudding arrived quickly, its intense sweetness likely to be polarizing amidst complex textures while an all new Sandwich from the \"Lunch\" section tantalizes taste buds thanks to Confit Duck Meat paired with Gruyere, Onions and housemade Orange Marmalade.  Globally influenced from Croque Madame to Vegan Tacos, a roadtrip south yielding Fried Green Tomatoes made into a Benedict with Eggs and Avocado, it is tapping Americanized Chinese that a King Crab Omelet reminisces of Crab Rangoon thanks to herbaceous Cream Cheese while included house Potatoes set a high standard by seemingly being fried, smashed, seasoned and fried again.  Finishing up savory, a plate of Huevos Rancheros from the acting Chef de Cuisine impressing with its slow-burn and cream-less Avocado \"Crema,\" fans of Steak & Eggs should not pass on The Stove's cooked-to-order version brightened by house Chimichurri and usually served with Tortillas that were apparently forgotten on this particular afternoon.  FOUR AND A HALF STARS:  Recently celebrating one year since opening, the new menu from Chefs Commings and Nunez continues to push the envelope in terms of creativity thanks to some innovative dishes while still executing basics like Breakfast Potatoes and poached Eggs with finesse.  Not a flawless visit, though flavors and Ingredients are still exemplary, owners need to be sure both food and service remain up to standard when key personnel enjoy a deserved day off.",

    "text": "We decided to try somewhere new for breakfast and where better to go than Eastern. At first glance, The Stove is slightly hidden by a much larger sign of the business located downstairs in the same building, which made us have to make a couple passes to make sure we were in the right area.  When we got inside, we were told there is about a 30 minute wait, which is completely fine. In my experience, a wait time usually means the food is worth it. The waiting area is a little awkward as you see sandwiches in between the dining area and bar, but the wait went by quick.  Once we were seated, we were given a menu for drinks/food. I started with my standard coffee. The waitress informed us everything is made to order so there is about a 30 minute turnaround, which made us start our order with the assorted pastries. After about 20 minutes, we realized that our pastry order was forgotten about, so we gently reminded them about it and they brought it right out. The blueberry Funfetti muffin was probably the best item we ate. After eating here he pastries, we waited for our food and wait is what we did. About one hour passed since our order when our food finally arrived. I ordered the chicken and waffle, which was supposed to be a Mac n cheese waffle. Not only did I not find Mac n cheese, I found a ton of onions, which I loathe entirely. That wasn't mentioned in the description. I did enjoy the chicken and the spicy syrup at least.  In addition, the restaurant is very loud. I felt like I was in a sorority with all of the screaming going. I literally couldn't hear my wife who was sitting across from the table from me. The restaurant is also a little cramped which puts your neighbors right on top of you. We had coffee spillers to our left and bottomless mimosas to our right. Not ideal.   I would give them 3 stars for the food, as it was pretty good, although pricey. They get 1 Star for the atmosphere though. The decor was neat and refreshing, but I felt like I was at a Delta Zeta party. And I don't appreciate being forgotten about. There's too many options for dining on Eastern to settle.",

Most places when you get all you can drink mimosas you can almost count on your waiter being very slow to get you refills and your juices taste like sunny delight. That is not the case for this place! The variety of juices is fantastic and they are all fresh squeezed and taste like magic in your mouth when combined with the champagne.  Now to get to the food: Delicious, flavorful, authentic, and presented beautifully. Absolutely loved every bite and also, what you see pictures is $4.5 on happy hour. It's a steal! Might just be the best brunch deal in town. Will be back here very soon and multiple times!",

    "text": "The Stove is truly a hidden gem here in the Anthem Henderson area.   I've had them bookmarked since they opened and I'm happy we finally made it out here. It was definitely worth the trip across town.  We arrived around 10am on a Saturday morning and were seated right away. The restaurant itself was cozy and the decor was pretty and relaxing.  We sat right next to the table where they set up all the dishes.   We had fun watching them put all the final touches on the plates before sending them out. It really made the experience more enjoyable.   For the food...everything that we ordered was delicious. Our buddy started off with the short rib empanada and all he kept doing was moaning and saying how the meat was so tender and how delicious it was. He was definitely happy with his meal.  The husband decided to go with the corned beef and eggs. Now they don't use that can corned beef stuff but corned beef brisket! The husband was amazed when he saw it on his plate.  The corned beef was not too salty but seasoned perfectly.  I went with the crabby patty and I love how they use real crab. It put the dish on a whole different level. I liked how they didn't just blob on the hollandaise sauce too. There was just enough and it didn't over power the whole dish. We all had no complaints about the dishes we selected.  Now I cant forget the yummy Instagram worthy drinks that we got. I'll be honest, after seeing the unicorn hot chocolate on Instagram and Yelp, I had to come and try it. The hot chocolate had huge marshmallows inside, topped with cotton candy.  Now if that wasn't enough, they also rimmed the mug with chocolate and sprinkles which added even more sweetness. Can you say diabetes in a cup?!? But it was oh so good! If you have a major sweet tooth like me, go get yourself a cup, you wont regret it.  The customer service we received was top notch! The gentleman that was helping us was so helpful and answered all our questions.  He even told us about the photo booth that we can use at our convenience.  This is definitely one spot you need to try",

Another twenty minutes passed before a waitress noticed us. We ordered coffee from her, and after another twenty minutes, the coffee finally arrived. We watched as plates of food piled-up outside the kitchen, becoming worried that it might be our order growing cold. Alas it was someone else's order. We left by the time we drained our cups. After an hour and twenty minutes, we walked away hungry. Less than twenty minutes away, we found a similar menu in a professionally run dinning room at the Kitchen. Table. We recommend dining there instead.",

Everyone at our table was using a menu to fan ourselves. I will also add that the restaurant was out of a couple of ingredients for some of the cocktails that a few of my friends ordered. Felt bad for them being told \"we're out\" on a few different items. Other than that food was very good and the staff was nice. I went for brunch, ordered the flapjacks and biscuits and jam, with a side of bacon. All yummy, took some to go. Also ordered bottomless mimosas, the best flavor in my opinion was the Mango. Very well mixed. You could taste the Mango as well as the champagne. Will be back in the fall/winter for some of those flavored Latte's and Hot chocolates.",

So I wanted to try the cinnamon roll with pecan sauce but they no longer serve it. So I tried the regular cinnamon roll. It was dry and had a very little sauce on it. But thankfully I ordered that in the beginning along with my main meal because it took an hour for my food to come. No exaggeration. 60 minutes to receive my main course. There was a couple who was sat before us and they received their food 10 minutes AFTER us. I'm not sure why it took so long but an explanation would've made the wait tolerable. By the time my food came, I was full from drinking coffee and water. So I didn't finish my crabby patty. The decor and outdoor area are nice but because of the wait, I had to give The Stove 2 stars.",

Since it was stacked on mac n cheese waffles,  there was no crisp to it. The chicken was seasoned, but I could have used some more spice.

    "text": "This was a disappointment. We made the drive down to The Stove. I had heard good things and wanted to check it out. The first thing we noticed coming through the door was the insanely loud music. Don't plan on a casual conversation, you have to yell to the people at your table to hear them. Not at all ideal for a relaxing breakfast. Our bow tie clad waiter came over and asked if we had been to The Stove before. We said we hadn't. The waiter said \"Ok\" and walked away. We would have loved to have ordered some coffee, but he didn't give us the chance. We had to flag him down to get him back just to get coffee. This is a breakfast joint, it should not be this tough. We had to flag him down again to order food.  The meals look fantastic, the presentation is outstanding. I had the farmhouse. It was surprisingly good (it's 2 eggs, the house potatoes, and your choice of meat- I had bacon). The house potatoes are a nice spin on the traditional hash brown. The Chiliquiles was another story. Cold and slimy with a strong funk overtone. Three bites in and my friend could not stomach another bite. I tried a small taste and couldn't bear a second. This plate tried hard, but accomplished nothing. The country fried steak was better. The chipotle gravy was a refreshing take on an old classic. The server neglected our table, one pass he filled 1 of the 3 coffee cups on the table. I thought he might come back with another pot but he never did. We finally had to flag him over to get our bill. It took over an hour for a meal that wasn't that impressive. By then all of our ears were ringing from the overpowering music.  We tried it, we were disappointed, and we won't be back. The poor service really pushed this one over the edge.",

However, even with the incredible food, I doubt we will be back because the service was absolutely terrible. We went here for brunch's few days ago and it took us over 45 minutes to receive our drinks from the bar (they came out with our food), and even after receiving part of our drinks it took another 15-20 minutes to receive the rest. The reason we were given for this was because they had only 1 bartender and he hadn't bartended before. Along with that, I had to chase down our food because it was being delivered to the wrong table, because of the wrong table number on the ticket. Very lack luster overall service by our server who seemed much more interested in talking to his friends who sat at another table to get things right, and when he did check on us, he also had to explain how it was a \"f***ing s***ty day\". As someone who has been in the restaurant industry for over 10 years, what we experienced was absolutely inexcusable. Thanks for the food, maybe one day we'll give it another chance, but can't be certain.",

Our food was very good, although it did take about 40 min from order to table.. The pecan pancakes were good but dry. We were never offered syrup??  So eating them with out any was odd.. The poutine waffle egg dish was very good.. We also tried the PB&J biscuits.  which was a biscuit with Peanut butter mousse, jam bacon and Jalapeno..Over all we had a nice breakfast. I just wish the waiter had been a bit more attentive. We asked for water, he brought water for 2 glasses, ran out of water in pitcher, never came back to fill up my glass.. Then when we asked him, he said he would be right back, then forgot a second time..  Little things make a big difference.. It is pricey.. we spent over 70 on breakfast for 3 people..It does get busy too.  It is a nice spot for breakfast.. but the food takes a while to come out and the coffee took 25 min.. otherwise it would have been 5 stars..",

    "text": "I was really excited to try this spot, all the food looked really amazing. Our server was very friendly, I was a little disappointed with how long it took to come greet us. I got the Suckling Pig and my husband ordered The Full Monty, but he got chicken and waffles instead . He said what he got wasn't bad. He also ordered the Country Fried Bacon and that was good. I didn't care for the Suckling Pig, I felt the hollandaise sauce and bbq sauce didn't go well together and the biscuit is too clunky. Also, it's served with some spring mix salad, not breakfast for me . We both got the caramel latte and that was yummy! The restaurant itself has no \"bufffers\" for noise, like drapes or anything that absorbs sound and a few times during our time there my anxiety was up as people were basically yelling at each other over each other (if you know what I mean).  I would like to try it again tho, there looked like there was a lot of yummy dishes and even the best of the best have off days.",

I really suggest the country chicken benny or the crab benny. It was absolutely fantastic, and I am 100% coming back. The customer service is a bit off but it was because we were in a new area of the restaurant. I loved this place, I suggest you should go here for a family reunion or just for a joyful and delightful time.",

It's on the second floor with poor signage so also adds to the confusion in locating. We had reservations and still waited 25+ minutes while I counted 9 tables open. We were walked to a table and then told to wait.  While waiting another group was sat by the same hostess. We stood there for another 5 minutes without any communication and were told we would have to continue to wait.  Also keep in mind we had a pregnant woman with us.  We asked if we should be sitting or standing in another location, since we were left in the middle of the room, or perhaps at one of the 9 open tables but were told by the hostess they would have to prepare another table and we would have to wait. Do not come here. Do not waste your time. There are 100+ breakfast places in this city to chose from.",

When we got there, just before 9:00am, no-one was up front. After waiting around 5 minutes the hostess came up and explained it would be a few minutes before we could be seated, as the kitchen was slammed. We waited nearly 20 minutes. While we waited, it seemed there was only one server (on Sunday morning?!?). The table of 4 men right by us had not been visited once l, by any employee, and had no food yet. Two other couples left without receiving service. I would guess that they had people call out sick, because there is no excuse for not having proper staff on a busy weekend morning. We also ended up leaving without being seated, or even receiving an update. It would have been nice if the hostess had explained the situation so we wouldn't have wasted 20 minutes.",

Usually only open for breakfast and lunch or for special hosted parties,  they opened for a great evening of unlimited food and drink. Prime rib, salmon, pastas, vegetables, wonderful stuffed olives, peppers and mushrooms, and plenty of appetizer plates, Scott Commings and Antonio Nunez prepared the amazing spread  and co-owner Steve Grodkiewicz was there to host us. We started with champagne and moved on to a great whiskey.  The view over the Las Vegas Valley is unlimited.  The deck of this second- floor establishment is great for a drink and a place to relax.  The Stove's Twisted Tea Room comes with a multitude of teas to pick from and every cup and saucer is purposely mis-matched.  With the most fabulous blueberry muffins, fresh baguettes, and an amazing menu, this was my 6th time there.  Their pecan pancakes are expertly made; they have a twist on the Eggs Benedict with chicken fried steak on their waffles, and an extraordinary table-side bananas foster.  Lunch is the best with a host of fresh salads like watermelon and sandwiches to pick from.  Try the duck macaroni or short rid empanadas, and maybe opt for the bottomless mimosas.  The private dining room can hold 45 guests, with a total capacity of 75.  Located at 11261 S. Eastern Ave. #200. Call 702-625-5216. Monday thru Friday 9-3, Sat and Sun 9-4.  They are making an announcement soon, can't wait to hear it.",

The reviews looked good and I must say, overall it didn't disappoint.   We were a party of three. I'm glad we arrived when we did (about 9AM), because they were packed with people waiting when we left. There was a section that wasn't open, but it appeared they weren't staffed for it.   They have a great menu with choices for everyone. My party had a variety of breakfast and lunch items and everything tasted great.   The kitchen was a bit slow, but its a minor thing.   The restaurant was LOUD when it got busy. I could barely hear the others in my party speaking. I think that's just the acoustics of the building, nothing this establishment could fix.   Great job!",

They talked to him and asked him questions and seemed to take a genuine interest in making sure we had a great experience there while having a small child with us. The food was great too! We'll definitely be back.",

Although we had checked in online we were waiting 45 minutes to be seated and our first waiter didn't acknowledge us for about 20 minutes. Then he left. Another 10 minutes went by without us having a menu or water. We are actually pretty patient people so we waited for another 5 minutes. Finally another waiter saw me and came over. I told him we hadn't ordered anything and it was our first time here. The second waiter was friendly however our food didn't come out until 45 minutes later. I give kuddos to the second waiter as he acknowledged that they were taking longer and he gave us a free appetizer to make it up. After a long 3 hour brunch we finished and had to wait to pay and give the first waiter my credit card. Service seemed very disorganized overall. Although I was disappointed by the service  I loved the ambiance, the food and the views the restaurant has. I would have to recommend their specialty banana pancakes because the chef comes out and prepares them infront if you while telling you a background story of where they originated from. Chef seemed humble and approachable and that was appreciated!",

Coffee was just,\" ok \",At this time our order was taken Marilynn ordered them fancy eggs and I, the country fried steak. The wait for the food was little long, but again atmosphere was amazing still awake was acceptable. Our food arrived and we started breakfast. The presentation was unbelievable I seen on photos. We started to eat food was amazing. My wife expressed that our food was unbelievably good, I would say the same thing but unfortunately I found the mishap on my plate wax paper that was embedded into the country steak batter. I have to say after calling server over everything was handled so professionally. Chef came over and apologized Major D came over and apologized and so did the server our meal was comped without asking. Still have to say that the food and environment was really good even after small mishap. I would truly come again and give the place a full benefit of the doubt. I'm giving this place 4 stars because in my heart I truly believe they deserve it",

The entire staff is so pleasant and customer service oriented, which my group and I love! The decor is so Instagram-able, they're growing their own herbs which is incredible!

    "text": "This was the most bizarre experience I've ever had at a restaurant. First of all, the menu on yelp does not match the physical menu we received there. There were tons of vegan options on the yelp menu, but when we went in, it was a tiny section with only 5 items. We got on their online wait list, but when we arrived, the waiter, Landon, told us the dining room was closed so we would have to sit in the tea room.. except the tea room wasn't set up yet and he was having his lunch in there. We explained it was our first time there and didn't have a preference where we sat, but he still seemed hesitant to have us sit in the tea room. Why would you accept an online reservation if you didn't have places for guests to sit?? It gets much weirder. Once we sat down, he asked us if we had ever heard of Kitchen Table, and then was awestruck and (in his words) \"insulted\" that we had never heard of it. He proceeded to ask us how long we've been living in Vegas that we had never heard of this amazing place. My fiance has been living and working in the Vegas hospitality industry for 13 years and never heard of Kitchen Table. The waiter couldn't believe it. Anyway, the whole deal with Kitchen Table was that The Stove had been opened by the same owners. He must have been the owner's son to have been so insulted, because no one would ever speak to a guest like that. Then he asked if we wanted to start with regular water or BLK water. When I asked what BLK water was, he hit me with the \"what?!?! You've never heard of BLK water?!\"  I felt like I was in high school being served by the popular girl and I was in chess club. It was so ridiculously unprofessional that when he walked away, I told my fiance I wanted to leave. I couldn't stand another minute of this man's insufferable arrogance and lack of interpersonal skills. So we left, went and had lunch at Vegenation where we always get exceptional service, and the food never disappoints.",

The service was extremely slow. \"Tea\" in the tea room is why we went - we LOVE tea! This was NOT tea. The tea drink selection was fine, but why do they serve cream in a square cup that cannot pour? The meal was NOTHING! Tiny portions of BAD food. They served 1 raspberry Cut In Half! For 2 people! Tiny \"scones\" and homemade jam tasted like it had gone bad! The meat was incredibly spicy and it was the size you would serve in a doll house. The view is nice but why would they have a deer head in a tea room? Creepy! We left to go find some real food!",

Because all the tables around having meals, was more like a diner (as in Dennys) than tea service. Service rushed and infrequent...plus missing key components of tea: Had to physically get up and ask for sugar and cream (for tea!) and then again for a spoon ( to stir sugar and cream in my tea!) Our server nowhere to be found, so another assisted when we approached tea brewing area. Also, please put the cream and sugar in a creamer pitcher and sugar bowl. Paper packets and the hipster square creamer box are weird when you are drinking from dainty china.  The decor is cute, the regular menu food looked awesome, maybe that is what we will try next,and hopefully 5 stars. Overall still enjoyed the tea, treats, and got to linger with good friends and a lovely view.",

At this point I figured Paula Abdul and Chris Potter was going to walk out of the back because we finally got our table, which I might add was really just two small tables butted up together... aka no elbow room!  So we finally got a server to take our order, we asked for a rush order because of how long we had to wait at this point, about 20 minutes later our appetizers came out but still no refills on water I started to wonder if they charged for water by the glass because we didn't get any refills until we asked for some.   Around 30 minutes after the apps came out we were told that our food was the next ticket. We finally got our food but the youngest at the table (5yo) had to wait an additional 15 minutes and he didn't get his food until all of us we almost done eating. If there is one thing this place is quick on is to change you for eating there... we literally got asked if we were ready for our bill... we never got asked how the food was, if we needed condiments, if we needed anything else besides water, or even water refills.   This place really surprises me, if you come alone or with one other person you'll probably love it, but this was a complete surprise almost no customer service and a rush to get you to leave... very surprised...",

When we were seated there were only cups for the 4 adults but not for the 4 children. The adults received water in a timely manner but the children didn't get any water. The server took our drink orders about 15 minutes after sitting  down. We also requested waters for the children at that time. 3 of the adult drinks came out in a timely matter but the iced tea didn't show up till about 20 minutes later after asking for water for the children again.   Our food took 50 minutes from time of order until it was delivered to our table. The kids meals came in lunch boxes which would have been a cute idea had the lunch boxes not been rusty. I get the idea of being kitchsy but this is still food and being placed so close to rust isn't appealing.   The food was only ok for the prices and the wait was totally unacceptable. The view of the valley was great tho. I hope that this was just a one off experience but even so it's not good business practice for a restaurant.  This space has been several different restaurants over the years. If our visit to the Stove is how they usually do business I won't be surprised when it turns up as another restaurant.",

From what it seems, they have a seasonal menu, so don't be surprised if you come 6 months later and the menu is different. Currently they have man duck confit dishes. The duck confit mac & cheese was my abosulte favorite. There was mushroom, duck, and some spinach mixed in. I got the crabby patty and was a bit disappointed. For $20.00, I thought I would have my mind blown, but alas it was not the case. I loved the vegetables it came with, but I lost to the overpowered fishy/ocean smell. My sister ordered a burger, not realizing it was a burger. I forgot what the dish was called, but I think there was a \"MAJA\". It was in the lunch section. It had some indian spices and came with french fries. We ordered a side of a pancake to share as a dessert, and it was very tasty. Their vanilla bean syrup is delicious as well! Expect to spend quite a bit on your dishes, but at least your dishes will be unique! The service was good, and I loved the decor. They also have a photobooth randomly in the center of the restuarant. Check it out! The Stove is on the 2nd floor of the building so look up for the sign! (bottomless mimosas are $19.00 if you would like to get turnt)",

The cappuccinos are EXCELLENT  (I had 2!) served in generous white cups creamy & smooth just ideal way to start my morning       The Stove menu is eclectic with a lot of twists on traditional Brekkie options~ including smoothies. Offering home baked pastries which are on display at the coffee /cocktail bar. We started with a blueberry muffin, tasty treat to begin with. We ordered the Avo Toast ( my FAV, I order this everywhere from Henderson NV to Charleston SC to Australia soooo I am kind of an expert...at least in my mind ) ABSOLUTELY stunning to look at and tasty too! A lot going on here next time I order this I will ask for the greens decoratively presented on top ~  to be along side and a little less dressed & for the dense crusty toast to be grilled on both sides, just MY preference ~      My hubs had the \"Suckling Pig\" pretty much a riff of Eggs Benedict with a twist replacing english muffins with Buttermilk biscuits adding smoked Pork & brown butter hollandaise~ ohhh and some jalapenos.... a SPECTACULAR presentation for sure and it was all consumed if you know what I mean. My hubs is a foodie for sure and commented \"it WAS good, also commented there was a lot going on tho ~       The Stove is very welcoming as the staff & chef want you to be happy and FULL, as you won't leave hungry . Just  the Jacques Pepin quote on the wall, the bookcase above the kitchen window with antique lunch boxes, cook books and assorted \"brick a brac\" PLUS I liked watching the chef putting the finishing touches on each plate as it came out of the kitchen ~ NICE TOUCH    Overall a VERY pleasant way to start the day, OR KICK START your afternoon with a \"Twisted\" tea~",

They have a bar with delicious pastry's, a team party room, the area you have delicious food and even a back room for events! The food is so amazing, with each dish have a fun creative flare to it!   Our server was awesome, I'm not lying, the best service I've had in a while! I couldn't decide between two dishes and asked him to surprise me! So It was between the avocado toast or the Savory French toast. This man brought me the Savory French toast, but added a huge side of guacamole! It may not seem like much, but that showed he really cared and he gave me the best of both worlds! In my opinion he killed it! Love this spot and i will be back!",

They're sweet without being overwhelming and a portion that is LARGE. My wife is a New Mexican and got the chiliquilies. She remarked that they weren't traditional, but were delicious.   I had the maharaja. This is my favorite chicken sandwich is Vegas. Tandoori chicken with spices that will blow your mind. Definite suggestion is to come in with friends and share food.   Wait staff is friendly and helpful. I'm a customer for life.",

    "text": "The past 6 years after moving to this area I have seen food establishments come and go; from Firefly to Standard and Pour, and I am hoping that \"The Stove\" is third time's a charm and will stay! The esthetic decor of the restaurant reminds me of something I could see in SF/LA. The placement of the furniture and decorations/plants definitely made this spot bigger than it seems.   From beginning to end it was a great experience! The hostess greeted us and we were seated fairly quick. Alec, our server, was fantastic! He answered questions we had about some items on the menu and recommended some of his favorites and what he honestly thought about the food, which was nothing but positive feedback. I liked how they had a vegan menu that caters to all types of customers. All items are cooked fresh to order besides pastries, which are baked every morning.   Ordered:  -Short rib empanada= ingredients compliment each other and just the right amount of crunchiness.  -Croque Madame- Alec's recommendation & worth it. Reminds me of a monte cristo. Great combo of ingredients and breaking the egg yolk was definitely food porn worthy.  -Chicken n waffles- overall meal felt light, which I was surprised because the waffles had Mac n' cheese. Was not oily, salty, or too bready.  -Mexican hot chocolate=tasted like Christmas! Toasted marshmallows, hints of cinnamon, didn't seem like powder was used, real chocolatey taste.  -Vanilla iced coffee- was a little sweet but tolerable, wished they had milk substitutes but maybe over time they'll add that on.  The staff was friendly and I believe we had one of the owners come up to us to ensure everything was going well, he even recommended to check out the photo booth afterwards.   I would definitely come back and try more of their food options and to hopefully check out their tea room option they offer.",

The most amazing thing is I ordered the Brussels sprout hash and it came out with out any brussel sprouts at all! The staff said the owner was gone so things were in chaos, I guess call ahead and see if he's there before you go!

The blueberry scone itself (flaky, buttery, loads of blueberry with just right amount of sweetness) is worth all the burpees I'm going to have to do tomorrow. The cinnamon bun comes running on a close second, but I'm also a sucker for scones.   The \"eggs and guanciale\" was well balanced dish, clean in its flavors and fun if you want a lighter fare. The \"country Benedict\" is rich so definitely eat the greens on your plate to balance the sweet batter of the waffles. The \"hang over corn dog\" is to die for and, well.... lives up to its name. While we loved the \"chorizo fritatta\", we all agreed it could have used a little more chorizo (we like out meats!). Don't forget to wash your meal down with a smooth and warm cup of \"lavender latte\", though I wish they served almond milk .   With its refined and homey menu, the bright and welcoming ambience, and a super friendly staff, \"The Stove\" is nothing short of perfection. It's so nice to have a menu of foie without being pretentious.",

My date got the country benny & I got the crabby patty (along with bottomless mimosas of course). The food itself was delicious but the mimosas were made with warm champagne. The service was the absolute worst. Basically we never saw our server again after we gave our drink order & my date had questions about the menu. Many servers walked by us & couldn't even glance in our direction or let us know they'd find our server or anything. Luckily I was able to flag someone down who identified himself as the owners son & he answered our questions & even took our breakfast order. After awhile someone came over (assuming he's the owner) & said the kitchen lost our ticket & he would personally make our food & comp the check. At this point we're both irritated but we're happy that they're rectifying the situation. Miraculously our food is out 5 minutes later.   I may or may not be back. The food was great but it seems like servers need to be retrained.",

Our table had the corned beef and eggs, Traditional Eggs Benedict, pancakes (both plain and birthday cake), scrambled eggs, Creme Brulee oatmeal and the duck hash. With all of this you would think there was more than 1 person at the table excited and happy about what they were eating. Not even the coffee was worth it. The only person that enjoyed their meal was the one with the creme brulee oatmeal and the 1 year old with a bowl of fruit. The flavors on the Benedict all blended together, no salt or anything. The only flavor that could be picked out was the egg yolk. Not even a hint of the hollandaise sauce or the smoked ham. Nothing. A little pinch of salt goes a long way. I had to steal some of the corned beef just to get some sort of flavor. The corned beef and eggs had no seasoning. It was more of a brisket. The oiled potatoes were mushy. It was just bland. Not even the mustard had a flavor. Too sweet. The pancake tasted like flour. The syrup would have been good, but the bottles were so crusted over from the sugar (obviously not cleaned in a while) that we couldn't get any out. Tried a few bottles. Same for the birthday cake pancakes. Just floury. Duck hash had no flavor and nothing to it. The bathrooms were dirty and sticky. No toilet paper. Trash cans over filling. The whole place just had a very in kept feel. The waitress was a little pushy but good. She was on top of it. The side of scrambled eggs had no flavor and were spongy. Looked over cooked. There's a line cook that decorates the food in front of everyone to watch. They are more concerned about their show than the quality of their food. After we left, we went to another place to get a snack just to have something edible and get coffee that was drinkable. Do not understand the hype for this place. The wait time for this place would make you think it's amazing. Not so much.",

Instead we noticed plenty of tables open that just needed to be cleaned Other guests and I sat waiting. When we finally sat down the server told us it would be another 30 minutes for food because they made everything \"fresh\" being in the restaurant business myself it is unacceptable to even tell the guest that. Eggs should never take more than 30 minutes to cook. I wish I had time to taste their food but because of such a long wait my family and I left hungry. The owner should take note that there were 3-4 other guest that walked out during the time were there. That's profit walking out the door, because the tables weren't flipped in a timely matter. Hopefully the service improves because this place has alot of promise.",

Then I find my dishes had elements that came from a can or prepackaged crap really says something. Jalapenos were like if canned quality and their fried onion garnish was stale, semi-wet out of a bag? I ordered the tomato soup, grilled cheese and deviled eggs... I got a bowl of fire roasted salsa much like from El Pollo Loco's salsa bar and the world's saddest halved slice of sourdough and with A Single slice of cheese and 2 mushroom slivers? And the deviled egg tasted like week old, over cooked hard boiled eggs with canned toppings... oh this was before taking 35min to order, then an extra 15min for a hot tea and then another 40min after that for my \"food\". In the end I ate most of the egg whites from the eggs and my sad sandwich... had two bites of the \"soup\". My potion was about $30...  The worst part was we were here for my boss's bday lunch and EVERYBODY hated it. Worst 2.5 hr lunch in history thus far.  I can see what this place is aspiring to be. It's wanting to be like a trendy restaurant plucked out of the Mission District in SF but it fails on pretty much every level. But it's priced similarly... I really do think their high yelp rating has got to be paid for.",

The cup size is about twice the size of coffee at a normal breakfast place. You get half and half or milk and a couple different options for sugar. They don't have flavored creamers.  Second visit I had the Farmhouse included 2 eggs (I had them poached), ham, house potatoes, and sourdough toast (came buttered). I had a choice between orange, strawberry, and blueberry jams. I chose strawberry, it was served in a small cup, and was a great choice. The ham was very good.   Both times I spent an avg of $12-16 per dish and $4 for coffee (with refills and to go cup of you request).",

Once we were seated it took o e hour for before our orders were taken. Then almost another hour before meals started being served. My friend and I both ordered traditional Eggs  Benedict. It was barely warm and the English muffins were so hard you couldn't even cut them with a knife. It was one of the worst meals I have ever had. Meals started slowly being served. 4 of the 16 women were never served and everyone else was done eating before one of the 4 ladies that were not served got up and complained to the owner. He came into the room with all kinds of excuses like \"we should have had a fixed menu\" and \"they weren't prepared for such a large group\". They knew two weeks in advance when reservations were made the amount of people coming. I will never go back and most of the women in the group said the same thing. Service was terrible and so was the meal.  .",

    "text": "There are a lot of places to eat breakfast/ lunch in South Las Vegas, but not many restaurants have me thinking about the next time I visit.  The style of the restaurant has  a country cottage feel to it.   The staff is very helpful in showcasing the menu and topping off my coffee.  Sundays and for a limited time they have live acoustic music on Mondays.     The menu: Everything sounded good so I decided to look at pictures from previous yelpers.  Big mistake!  That just made it harder to make a decision.   Marcos our server made some suggestions and I ultimately decided on some banana fosters pancakes, short rib empanadas, and my wife got the crab cake Benedict.        The taste: Wife and I both really like the short rib empanadas with black beans, sour cream and green sauce to start.  I really could have ordered another one and could have left the restaurant happy, but no I decided to attack my sweet tooth and have the banana fosters!  To my surprise the Chef who made my Banana fosters is Hells Kitchen winner Scott Commings!  Oh, and yes it was delicious(good for 2 people).  I was able to steal a few bites of my wife's crab cake Benedict and I can say that the crab still had some of that ocean sweetness to it!  Came together well with the artichoke and hollandaise sause.      Final thought: I really like the design of the place. Very nice, comfortable main area with the live music did it for me. They have a nice party area that can be closed off from the rest of the world.  Very diverse menu, so you could say they definitely have something here for someone who's picky or just too open minded like myself.  The service provided by Marcos was great very personable.  In short \"The Stove\" has already got me thinking of my next visit!",

We noticed most dishes sat for quite a while with severs/staff walking past.  Other than that the staff was very attentive and amazing EXCEPT one guy. He had a kind of mohawk hair cut and he was the only one who wasn't moving. Everyone else walked with intent;  they had something to do and somewhere to go, trying to get people served and customers taken care of. Not this guy. He walked around the restaurant as if you had nothing to do and when he WAS working it was the slowest I'd ever seen someone move. At one point he had a small piece of paper or straw wrapper or something and playfully threw it at another server.  Rather than picking it up when it fell on the ground he kicked it under a table.. it was just all together strange.  I got a Benedict it was super good.  My friend on the other hand got the pecan pancakes and there were literally two pieces of pecan on them.  The flavor was great but it definitely wasn't what was explained on the menu. The flavor was great but seeing some pics posted here and reading the description on the menu, it wasn't what we expected. We mentioned it to the server and she called the manager over who agreed there should have been way more on her dish and \"they probably got busy and didn't realize many pecan came out.\"",

If you really like spicy, egg,potato and chorizo this will be your new favorite dish. The egg tacos are bomb! And the savory French toast is sublime. And the owner is just the sweetest. You won't be disappointed.",

We did have to wait about 20 minutes for a table but it's to be expected for a Sunday Brunch. The menu is broad and creative with a number of really appealing items; I had the chix & waffles which was good but I quickly developed plate envy when seeing my friend's Croque Madame and another's Country Fried Steak. The service was absolutely fantastic. Overall a great brunch spot.",

They have a coffee bar, pastries to go,  dining room, tea room (awesome) and a private room that is perfect for hanging out with friends. Get the short rib empanadas, the salmon benny, the dirty BLT or the BRG. So, so good. Well done Antonio and Scott!",

It was clean and service was kind and patient. We tried the dirty BLT, it had jalapeno bacon, avocado, and a sunny side up egg, the short rib empanadas, and the Mexican egg. It was all so fresh and full of flavor. But what ended up catching my attention was that on Sunday they have a brunch with live music and \"tea time\". I have a friend I just had to take for tea time brunch so we went back about a week later with a small group and tried a ton more food and had tea! I would recommend trying the pancake/sausage corn dogs. They were delicious!!! Really I don't think anything on the menu could be bad. The food was SO good. The only downside is I live kind of far away. Hopefully they'll open a closer location someday! :)",

    "text": "My partner and I are always trying to find new brunch spots around town as it's my favorite meal of the day, so I was eager to try this place out. We were immediately greeted with an estimated 1.5 hour wait time; granted, it *is* New Year's Day, so a busy restaurant was to be expected. But in reality, there were lots of empty tables and our wait wasn't longer than 20 minutes (we suspect their list had not been updated when we checked in). For a place called The Stove, the indoor temperature was closer to The Refrigerator. I opted to keep my jacket on. It took a bit for the server to get to us, so we sat for a minute with just ice water. That was the only time during the entire meal our glasses were that full. While we waited, we had time to visually dissect the restaurant: we noticed that the floors were pretty filthy and dirty dishes were left out--few only inches behind my shoulder on a counter. Overall, the aesthetic of the restaurant is very hipster, cool, and casual. I especially liked the suspenders each of the servers were sporting. Our server Krystal was upbeat and pleasant, and if it weren't for her, I would've given this place one less star. We ordered coffee and a cinnamon roll as an appetizer. It's comical because the header for appetizers on the menu reads \"1st Things 1st,\" and yet the cinnamon roll got to our table last--well after we had been served our entrees which I will get to in a minute. The coffee came first, but I was met with an awkward situation when I had nothing to stir it with, and so I used my fork as did the table next to us. We could tell they were even more frustrated with the slow service than we were. The wait was a little on the long side for our food, but when it came, it looked Instagram worthy. Small note: we asked for his eggs to be over-easy, and mine over-medium, but we found there was little difference between them. Not a huge complaint. My boyfriend had the corn beef which was \"alright,\" and I went with the country fried which I felt was over-seasoned. Still, I cleaned my plate. The food wasn't terrible, but for the price, I'd say it isn't worth it. We ended up having our appetizer as dessert; the cinnamon roll was good, but you could have switched it out with a store bought one and I probably wouldn't have noticed. Since it was quite a drive getting here anyway, I think it's safe to say I won't ever be coming back.   tl;dr: This place was alright. The food is pretty (and pricey), but nothing worth salivating over. The service was kind of slow and felt incomplete at times. And the restaurant could be a little cleaner too.",

I've been twice this far and each time, we have had to stand uncomfortably at the front door or wait outside on their sunny patio for a table. It's always very busy and very loud.   Service is adequate, nothing great. But the food? The menu looks great but in talking to people at the tables next to me or my friends who go with me, the food is just...very average?? The last time I was there, I had to send my iced tea back because it tasted old and rank. Eggs have not been cooked the way I've requested. Muffins are not toasted, they're just glopped with sauce.  Between the noise and the wait and the average service and the average food, I am hard-pressed to say I want to try a third time?",

Sure, it's not that super luxurious feel you get from restaurants on the strip, but let's be honest, the best places are not on the strip. The place satisfies even the best of local choices. The menu was well thought out and the decor was very refreshing, especially with the wide open windows which offer a great view of the area. Yes this area gets busy around those hungry times, but it is well worth it. Try everything. You will not be dissapointed.",

The reason why I didn't give this place 4 stars is because of the service. I can't even recall what my servers name was and i'm not sure if he was just in the weeds or maybe a little new at being a server, but he just seemed all over the place. We only got checked on once after receiving our food and it took a long while before getting our check after asking for it a few times. Right after picking up our payments, he ran by our table and asked us if we wanted free birthday cake pancakes because it was a made by mistake. Given that it was my birthday my friends said yes right away. A part of me was thinking, he should've offered to put it in a togo box since he knew we were literally cashing out, ready to go. Since they were free, I was just like oh well i'll just try some and then ask for a box. I'm usually not a fan of birthday cake flavored anything, but I tried it anyways. I would probably not order it... didn't see anything that special about it. I will probably be back and hope that my experience next time will be different. I ordered the poutine waffle fries and it was delicious!! I've never tried gravy on waffles, but I found it oddly satisfying. Definitely something I would come back for.",

As others noted it was a little chilly inside, but I credited that to being 40' outside and we were seated at the big windows.  When the door opened a cold breeze would whip in but I felt more sorry for the hostess than us!  The service was very good, drinks were quick and refills were offered frequently.  We met some friends there so if there was a wait for the food, as others suggest, we were not troubled at all as we had much to talk about and welcomed the time to visit.  And...  good things take time!  I had the banger and eggs poached with house potatoes instead of the potato mash and my SO had the traditional eggs benedict.  Both were delicious, I want to try the country benedict next time, but he will stick with the traditional.  When he finds great eggs benny he does not waver, and he said they were very very good, as did our friend who ordered them as well.  We will definitely be back, early again for sure to avoid the crowds.",

I would not typically try an unknown place, which would have been my loss in this case.  Our wonderful server Crystal was a pleasure and made sure we were happy every time she came by.

After 45 mins pass by we were about to leave due to nobody in the staff notifying us do note it is just the two of us and we saw multiple groups walk out and still nothing. I decided to go up to the host and she stated they texted us but we never received anything. So then they sat us down immediately and apologized. So keep in mind if you are waiting and it seems like it's taking to long make sure to ask them for a update because they just might forget about you like they did about us. After sitting down we were greeted by a server named Alec he was by far the reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars. His customer service was perfect and literally saved this place from a really bad review. Anyways we went ahead and ordered the bottomless mimosas at $19 per person. We tried the different flavors they had mango, strawberry and hibiscus all were very tasty. For an appetizer we got the empanadas which were perfect. We then ordered our main dish I got the suckling pig Benedict and my wife the crappy patty. Both dishes were great. After 2 and a half bottles of champagne later our server Alec gave us a complimentary cookie for dessert which was a great gesture. Total was $89 pretty pricey but worth it. So if you decide to try this place out make sure you're prepared to wait awhile for a table and if it seems like too long ask the host for an update.",

None of the kitchen staff were wearing aprons, hair nets or hats.  Even worse you could see dirty grease on the back wall around the broiler.

I've NEVER had subpar service, in fact, the owner comes out and tries his very best to greet every table. He even gets his \"hands dirty\" so to speak. Brought me glasses of champagne to the table and drank with me for my bday (which is pretty normal because I've seen him do it with others) but he doesn't get plastered. Just a dope ass environment that is very \"family\" like. You just feel at home with EVERYONE here.   PS: don't miss the photo booth!!!",

Our bartender suggested the Butternut Squash Hash and it was just as amazing as she has described. However, our BLT was disappointing. In my opinion, it's hard to fuck that sandwich up. But The chef at The Stove did just that. First, what kind of BLT only comes with two slices of bacon?! They also forgot the sundried tomatoes. Simple mistake. But waiting 15 minutes for them to bring it to us, is not! The service was good but VERY slow. There seems to be more hype than deserved here.",

Everything was done perfectly! Serving sizes were perfect as well. Service was exceptional. Staff gave us awesome recommendations. They really new the menu. If I could rate them higher I would! Get here early. We arrived at 8:00. By the time we finished our meal there was standing room only. You will not be disappointed.",

I called Sunday morning and asked if I could make a reservation for two in the tea room for same day at 2:30.  The receptionist was friendly and efficient even though I could hear how busy the restaurant was.  She got me booked which we were thankful for.  We arrived 15 min early and the hostess walked us right in.  There was only three other tea tables booked along with ours.    Our server was a lady named BROOKE.  Welcomed us and told us if we had any questions about the tea or the menu to go ahead and ask as she dropped off a couple glasses of water.  She was very friendly and gave us a few minutes to look over the menu.  We decided on ordering the FORMAL TEA, UNICORN hot chocolate, pastry basket, sausage corn dogs and my daughter wanted some cheese curds that wasn't really on the menu but they rang it up as a side for us.   The presentation of all the foods was absolutely wonderful!  Thank you to the chefs and workers that prepare the plates. Well done!  The only thing that I didn't particularly like but my daughter loved was the unicorn hot chocolate, tasted more like cinnamon to me than hot chocolate.    Prices were spot on.  The bill wasn't too expensive considering everything we ordered and how yummy everything was.   The only real negative for me was that it was very loud in the main dining area and a little loud for my liking in the tea room but hey... it's a hot, trendy, NEW spot that people are going to want to come to so I guess that's to be expected.   Thank you to The Stove and Staff!  We will definitely recommend.",

I am in love with the ambiance of this place. It is sectioned into 3 areas. The first is the main dining hall, the second a tea lounge, and the third a coffee room wherw you can chill and use the wifi. It's very instagramable. The muffin was very tasty and the tea perfectly refreshing. Its located on the second floor so the natural lighting and the views were amazing. I will be back like tomorrow.   UPDATE:  I loooooove it. Every person in this restaurant was nice from the hostess, to our waiter, to the tea expert, and the awesome chefs who come over to talk and make sure you are enjoying your experience. I ate the chiliquilies this time and it was big enough to split with my friend. The flavors were satisfying and delicious. I was also happy with the prices.",

Also, they were out of black tea (huh?) and I had to go with Earl Gray Creme which was really gross and I didn't drink it.   Pecan pancakes - I did not care for these. 3 large, very dense pancakes. Some bites were extremely salty, like they didn't fully mix the dry ingredients. I didn't even eat half.   Pulled pork eggs Benedict- my husband ordered this and it was more like a lunch plate with the BBQ sauce. He said he didn't care for the biscuit and preferred the more traditional English muffin.   Ambiance: small, cute space with a great view of the snow on the mountains.   Service: attentive, but not observant.  I'm not one to complain but you could see I hardly ate or drank my food.   Location: we had trouble finding this place because all we could see was The 052 bar, but my husband looked up and noticed the round logo on the 2nd floor above the bar.   We will try this place again since it's a cute brunch place and a convenient location, but next time on a Sunday and I'd order something else.",

To start off, the guy's review below that stated that this place Is called The Stove but that it should've been called The Refrigerator, spot on. It was freezing cold! Even with our jackets on, it did not suffice. When we had walked-in there apparently was an employee next to us the whole time but we were never greeted. We had to wait for another gentlemen finish seating his guests to then be recognized. We had made a reservation prior, but apparently that didn't matter. There were many tables open & we weren't seated until we had asked another server what was going on.   We had ordered 3 different lattes off the menu: the apple pie latte, lavender latte & the tres leches latte. All 3 were pretty bland & did not taste like the names of the lattes. I would say the apple pie was the worst--it was more like water with some coffee & the aroma of apples. At first they messed up the order & gave us two lavender lattes & a tres leches, so I had to wait for the other latte. This was the first of many times we had to wait throughout our dining experience!  We had to wait almost an hour for our food to arrive. The food was just okay, nothing amazing. But then one of our orders were incorrect. They quickly changed out the dish for the correct one but then this one was cold in the middle.   I mean the server was cool. He let us know that they'd give us a small discount for the food taking forever but what about the incorrect orders, cold food & horrible lattes? We wanted to come back to try the tea but probably won't return ever again. Wasn't worth it.",

I should also note: when I mentioned to the staff during my visit about the chix/waffles - the guy was a total ass.",

The $19 bottomless mimosas are awesome because they serve the champagne separately so you can add as much to your juice as you'd like. Hostess and wait staff are always friendly and helpful. The only con is the acoustics in the building are weird so it gets loud when crowded.",

    "text": "Third time back here in a matter of weeks and frankly all I can say is third verse same as the first!  Rachael waited on us and she was amazing everyone who works here is so nice and they are so helpful! Seems like they all enjoy their jobs!  But wanted to highlight our food from this visit so hubby did the traditional Benedict and wow. Delicious ! My friend did the pig version and again amazing and I did the shumai maybe (can't remember what it was) but basically stewed tomatoes in a skillet with an egg and a little arugula and feta. It was an Israelite dish and loved the smaller portion but still could not finish it. What a pack of flavors!! Next time I am trying the unicorn hot chocolate for sure! And the other thing I LOVED as I don't have kids and can't tolerate a screaming child that the parents ignore is they serve the kids meals in plastic and in a lunch box!!! Soooo thoughtfulness everything they do is so full of LOVE!!   Funky location so keep your eyes open. They are in a little strip center right off Eastern but upstairs! So the views really are beautiful and especially if you have a larger party and sit in the \"front room\". But anywho. Michael was our server and he was delightful!  He had an awesome personality and was super friendly! We asked about a couple of items as to what to order and made some choices. And here is what we ended up with (btw all the pics are accurate on yelp for their food! It all looks and tastes THAT GOOD!  This was our first time and will NOT be our last! We had an order or the French toast (you get three huge slices and topped with beautiful fresh berries), the avocado toast with poached eggs that were perfectly cooked on top and an order of the crab Benedict. I have to say I tasted all three dishes and every one of them (each a distinctly different flavor) were amazing!  Also the bananas foster done table side looked incredible also!  The crab Benedict had a lovely hint of Tabasco in the sauce and the potatoes they sat on were delicious. Loved the toast on the avocado toast as it was delicate and not too crispy to cut the inside of your mouth but light enough that it was not dense. Really amazing food and as I said Michael, our server, made us feel right at home and was super funny!  Oh but go hungry the portions are stout but I Gaurantee you will eat it!",

The menu is very interesting and eclectic. Scones biscuits, avocado toast, short rib tacos, corn dogs, soup, salad and vegan options. Very hipster, in a good way.  Service was good staff was friendly  Food was really good! I had the  tacos and the meat was so tender and flavorful.   My friend had the PB and j biscuit and I had total food envy when it came out. It looked so delicious and she said it was killer!   The best thing about this place is the price. You get quality food for a steal. Highly recommend!",

The kitchen is open and the staff are friendly.  Now the food is fantastic as well. I'm vegan so I had the vegan Benedict.-delightful! I had a non-vegan friend with me and she loved her food as well. The only real critique is that is is a bit pricey, but hey when you have that kind of quality you can charge for it!",

I asked the bartender what I should get since it would be my last chance in that restaurant and he told me to order the pork eggs benedict. The poached eggs were yummy but the biscuits were so dry underneath it probably could've cracked a tooth honestly. I couldn't tell what the yellow sauce was on it but tasted like a nacho cheese sauce that gave me the worst heartburn of life. Deadass had to stop by a CVS and pick up an anti-acid. Also why are the Bloody Mary's mixed with Sake instead of vodka. LMK",

You can't beat the variety of their menu - they have something for everyone, including vegan options. The herb wall they have by the expo line is my favorite. The fresh pressed juice they make in-house is amazing with so many flavor choices. And you just can't beat the atmosphere - you can look around the room and just tell that everyone is really enjoying themselves. Top notch surface from the servers to the bussers to the cooks in the kitchen, everyone there is working hard to make it an enjoyable time for their guests. No doubt we will continue to make this our regular spot and encourage everyone to try them out!",

The only complaint I could possibly have is the long wait, which is a tell tale sign of how great this place is. Usually a 3 hour wait. So go very early or very late to avoid the long waiting list. I would also complain that this place should be open for dinner because I could only imagine what an amazing dinner menu it would be!  You can't go wrong with the table side banana fosters pancakes! The shortrib omlet was incredible! Really everything I have had here has been very good.",

I got the egg white frittata and my hubby got the eggs Benedict (we're told they are very accommodating and will cook up anything you want, doesn't even have to be a menu item!)  My favorite part of the frittata was the cauliflower puree, to die for! Tastes very earthy and I'm impressed they could extract that much flavor from the humble vegetable. My husband's eggs Benedict had a creamy hollandaise sauce and the ham had the perfect amount of salt for the dish. Their bread is also toasted well - weird thing to notice but it's crunchy and buttery, not just an afterthought like most places.  Can't wait to come back next time we visit!",

Ten more minutes passed and still no one. Twenty minutes people! Twenty minutes passed and we didn't even get water. The annoying thing is that a couple that came in the restaurant after us got their order taken already. I can't even tell you about the food because after 25 minutes of waiting, we just stood up and left. My wife talked to the hostess on the way out about their terrible customer service and someone (I'm guessing the manager) chased us down to apologize. Also, he must have known we were ignored all this time because he knew exactly what to apologize for when he saw us leaving...  We eventually decided to go to Mr Mamas Breakfast and Lunch. Right off the bat, we were greeted with smiles and hospitalities. I joked with my wife, asking her \"how long do you think we'll get water?\"  Less than 3 minutes, our waitress already filled our glasses and offered us coffee. And Mamas  is packed. It's not as empty as The Stove. The Stove had 5 tables including ours so I didn't understand what took them so long to acknowledge us. They only noticed when we got up to leave.   I never got the chance to eat at the stove, and I don't think I'll ever want to after this morning's experience.",

Food is consistently delicious although my friend's Monte Cristo was very doughy but had Short Rib Tacos, yum!  Avocado toast and also the salads are delish. Definitely glad to have this 'gem' in the neighborhood!",

The food is ok but it is not worth waiting for it.   You can get food as good or better in other places like Kitchen Table.    The pastries tasted store bought and not fresh.

Whether for a family breakfast or a birthday celebration, I would recommend coming here!

I personally would not come back  again on my own however I would def take my kids or friends for them to check out this place if they decided to come with us to town.  It is well put together but I feel the food isn't for us and hubby agree. We ordered pastries, empanadas short ribs, Mexican eggs as our appetizer. Hubby and friends got corned beef , eggs tacos & I got monte cristo. Love the homemade jam but I feel my meal was a little greasy and of course after sharing the appetizers I was too full to finish my meal so I took it home and the more it sit, the more greasy it got . Place is always busy and there is no reservation except they will hold your table for 10 min and will text you to let you know your table is ready. We were #6 on the list and still #6 while waiting at home for approx 30 min so we drove there, make our presence known and within 15 min we were seated.  My friend cell showed at that time we were #5 on the list",

Issues- You are only allowed one tea to choose from.  The waiter kept telling us they were out of\"tea biscuits\" then they were out of variety of \"petite fours\" so we only had one. They put us in a two top so the waiter said he couldn't give us each a tower as they normally do.  Why did we make reservations if they couldn't be ready for a tea party?   Positive- an eclectic restaurant with a variety of foods on the regular menu.  I will try this restaurant one more time, only I will be ordering from the regular menu, because the regular food looks amazing.",

The menu is meant to please a wide spectrum of food lovers, from the foodie foodie (ie pork belly, micro greens, etc.) to the vegan (what vegan has had a vegan Benedict?) and everyone in between.   The pork belly Benedict was well worth it.  The plate was full and  thoughtfully put together.  The sandwiches are sizable and filling.   Can't wait to try more entrees, but even more so just hang around with a cup of coffee or tea on the weekend.   PS- just moved here, so it will be nice to make this spot a regular hangout.",

The portions where a little small but, they served it on an massive flat glass plate which different. Everything was perfectly seasoned and, the waiter was probably the best I have ever had.

    "text": "Had the pleasure of trying The Stove today for lunch and everything we ordered was delicious! Outstanding personal and friendly service. Love the decor, the atmosphere, and the overall feel. We ordered the short rib empanadas to start followed by the avocado toast with poached eggs, the corned beef with poached eggs, and the Full Monty.  All items were cooked to perfection and the flavors were spot on.  And for cocktails they use Sake since they don't have a liquor license, just beer and wine, but wow, you wouldn't miss it. The cucumber saketini was refreshing and the creamsicle drink was so yummy, also.  Highly recommend you try The Stove!",

The Stove is your ultimate brunch spot for food, girls time, hopefully you see your grandma take a champbong like a G (like I did), and eclectic service from Mike and Summer! Poutine waffle fries what?!?! I was charmed on my first visit and I'm hooked (or obsessed) now on my second. Well done ladies and gentlemen!",

    "text": "Saw the many positive reviews and we decided to try it. Location is a bit challenging first time since their logo on the building is so small compared to the other establishment sharing the building. It's on the 2nd floor.   Menu is varied and fresh, decor is charming, open and reflects a upscale country kitchen. Two main dining rooms and one room for larger parties.   Service was excellent. Friendly and upbeat. Owner, Antonio, came over to check on us and very engaging and server Rebecca was attentive and a joy to engage with. View to the valley and Strip in the distance with mountains is a True bonus. Worth a visit.",

Food is all right not bad but but not sure it's worth the wait knowing that there are other great food places with less wait. Place is nice and the waitress was very nice. It just feels very unorganized as far as the timings from wait to food prep. Waiter said it's because everything is made from scratch which I'm sure is True before the restaurant opens but you don't make a sauce or bread or meat from scratch when you order, only the eggs",
