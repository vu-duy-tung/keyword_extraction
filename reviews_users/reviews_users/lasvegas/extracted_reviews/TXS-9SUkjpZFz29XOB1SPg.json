    "text": "Located on Las Vegas Boulevard, just south of Sahara, this is the second location for M&M in Vegas. If you have a hard time finding it, look for the Holiday House Motel on the East side of the road. They are in the same parking lot, which features excellent views of the Aztec Inn (which I hear has a great buffet by the way) & an Ihop...ok, kidding about the views. But this new location is definitely much larger then the first, with quite a bit more seating and a lot more of an open feeling. Everything else remains just about the same, including the styling, menu, etc.  While this was my first visit to this new location, I've been to the original a couple times. I've tried quite a few different things at the other that I wasn't happy with, but I'll save that for another review of it. At this location I ordered something I've never gotten before, Smothered Pork Chops. For $14.99 you get two pork chops and 3 sides. The pork chops themselves were on the smaller side, pretty tough and also dry. Since they were smothered, it wasn't too bad eating them, but the texture of the gravy was a bit weird and it was way too salty. Besides helping the meat be more edible, it didn't really do anything for the plate. For my 3 sides, I chose greens, cornbread dressing and fried okra. It could just be new opening issues, but besides the greens, all the sides were lacking. The dressing was extremely grainy and also covered in the overly salted gravy. Okra was basically flavorless and seemed barely fried making them too greasy. Overall, the sides just weren't what I'm used to getting from the other location.  Unfortunately, the same could be said for the service. Our waitress was friendly for the most part, but I felt a bit rushed and they were having strange issues with getting drinks. When we first sat down, they completely skipped me when taking drink orders and then brought out the wrong drink to a couple people in our party. When it came time for refills, they had almost no clue what anyone was drinking and had to come back more then once to ask. They were also bringing out warm tea without refilling ice, or even just bringing out extra glasses of ice. Some of this could have partially been the fault of the busser, who looked like he was on his first day, but with only 1 other table sat during most of our meal, it was pretty frustrating. We got checked on a couple times, but again, the service just wasn't like what we get at the original location.  There were a few things however that matched what we're used too. Maybe most importantly, but it was the cornbread pancakes and fried chicken. Those little fluffy cakes brought out before your meal are absolutely delicious and if I could, I'd probably order like a half stack of those things by themselves. They also seem to be executing the fried chicken well. I only had a small bite, but I had no complaints. It had nice crispy, salty skin and was cooked just right. Very juicy and not a hint of dryness. There's definitely a reason they're known for that chicken.  Now, when the employees at the Charleston location told us about this new one opening a couple months ago, they told us it was going to be open 24 hours. It looks like those plans changed, and they're only going to be open 24 hours during some portions of the summer. I guess at this time, they are thinking only weekends in the summer time. All other times they'll be open from 7am - 9pm. Breakfast is served up until either 10am or 11am, depending on the day of the week.  Really, I'm still torn on M&M. With as many things as I've had at the other location that I didn't like, I can't say for certain that I'd give that one any more than 3 stars either. But with this one having both service and food that just doesn't compare to the original, I'd say it's a solid 2.5 that I'm rounding up to a 3 since they're new. We may be back if we were in the area, but I'd much rather visit the original location for the time being.",

We asked the waiters and waitresses what was going on after about an hour and they would say they're checking on the food but none of them came back to tell us anything, they kept avoiding us. It's not cool to waste people's time this way, at least tell us what's going on, we really tried to show support but...come on. People were walking out back to back. We only stayed bc we were from out of town and didn't want to waste anymore time riding around trying to find somewhere else to go. Besides that, we figured as long as we waited the food just had to taste amazing...WRONG! 2 people ordered the chicken...it was COLD. One person ordered ox tails, another ordered short ribs ( he got 2 small ribs and they wanted him to pay $30), I ordered fried snapper and it was over cooked. All the sides were cold. How in the world is the food cold?? I asked the waiter for the manager, she came over looked at all the food we had just gotten served. We informed her why we weren't eating it, she says let me take care of this. Next thing we know, the COOK comes out and says \"what's cold!! \" (I really have to laugh bc this seems so unreal.) No customer service whatsoever, no hi how are you guys or anything, just \"what's cold.\" First off, what manager takes the COOK out of the kitchen with a full restaurant and people complaining...trust me we were not the only ones upset. Anyways he said he would \"hook us up\" with more food...really! I asked for the manager again but she was literally HIDING in the back...she sent the waiter out with our ticket that she had taken 25% off of. I was not going to pay for this but she would not come from the back to speak to me. 25% off a ticket and the food wasn't even eaten. If we thought we weren't gonna go to jail for not paying, we sure wouldn't have!",

    "text": "I really wish no stars were an option here. As a local I was excited about the second location due to the Charleston one being so small and this one having a later closing time. Um, scrach that nonsense! It was shady enough in the daytime on a Sunday after church I don't even wanna know what Saturday night is like. First things you relise is parking sucks. Maybe 4 spots 1 of which is handicapped but you could park at the pay by the hour hotel right nextdoor. My party of 5 was shuffled to the far back past several empty tables after waiting 20 minutes already to a dirty table that can seat 8. I place my expense camera on far end of the table away from my party. We order, fried chicken both white and dark meat were order, paid extra, spliting sides of different things at the table, all 5 ordered waters. 15 minutes later our water shows up, dropping off on the side of the table that has my camera, purses and so on you know, not the people. But no straws but she'll be back. 10 minutes later dry mac n cheese, still no straws and a leg. I had the kids split it. They are hit and hungry. 3 larger groups have now come on and have been seated with their order taken.  Oh look, our straw showed up, just 1, 4 more to go. We ask another waiter he said he'll be right back, he was swallowed by the black hole too. A thigh, and the saddest strip of chicken came out. We pointed and said whats that, is that supposed to be a breast the waitress said \" I don't know I don't eat meat\". Those 3 large groups  are finishing up their meals now, Im still a piece of dried out over cooked piece of chicken! I cant hardly wait to leave. No complimentary cornbread cakes like normal, no knowledge of your food, overcooked, under served, I question going back to the original on Charleston after this experience. Hated the environment, the food, the staff. The magic and warm feeling of home you used to have is gone with this place.",

For one our silverware was dirty, when we got our food it was horrified it was cold the smother chicken and gravy is like they fried the meat and dumped hella gravy over it, to cover the look the plates were dripping with gravy, and also it was cold. So disappointed I cook soul food and that place is definitely not it. The server was trying to be nice about it, but come on the food was just not up to par. The greens were out of a can, I was more embarrassed than anything taking my friends there I would of been better cooking myself. I can't believe this place has even been open this long, I felt I wasted my money was pissed and still hungry. If Chef Ramsey would of went in there he would of closed them down.

If it's dusty and dirty I will politely exit and do my Yelp review  we were immediately greeted by almost all of the staff which was nice. Our waitress was so nice and welcoming, she never left us unattended. The wait for the food was a little long however the drinks are free refills and so is the cornbread a plus. I will definitely be back when I visit Vegas again. The owner actually came in and came around to all the tables and engaged in conversation which was really welcoming.",

We weren't even asked if it was for here or to go so we sat down and waited ... come to find out 30 minutes later if you want to order to go you have to sit at the bar . It took 40 minutes for someone to take our order and we got rushed during that and it took 1 hour for our food ! Customer service Horrible horrible horrible and the staff has no care in the world !",

    "text": "Everything from the time we walked in until we left was not a good experience. First we were waiting a long time to be seated. Its soul food on a Sunday so I sort of expected that. Once we were seated the waitress gave us our menus and when I flipped it over to the breakfast side she said that they weren't serving breakfast anymore because it was after 12. It was actually not even 11:10. So we ordered our food around 11:15 and we did not get our food until 12. They brought out 2 sides of what they said were scrambled eggs with cheese. First they were overcooked and not scrambled. But where was the rest of the food and why did the eggs come out first on their own plates? The next thing to come out was some \"hot wings\". First the chicken was on a plate with the hot sauce in the middle. When we asked why it was served this way the waitress asked if we wanted it tossed. Typically hot wings are served tossed unless you specifically request that they not be tossed. They next dish to come out was the chicken and waffle. Waffle was not cooked completely and there wasn't any butter on the waffle.Next to come out was a side of pancakes and they didn't have any butter either. Next was the chicken wing breakfast. The potatoes were cold. The next meal to come out was the sausage breakfast. Now the sausage was over cooked, the grits were not cooked correctly with cheese. The cheese was sprinkled in top and not mixed in. This plate actually had \"scrambled\" eggs with cheese. Yes all the food came out separately. We had to ask for refills of the drinks 4 times before we actually got it. Our server barely paid us any attention and then when one of the other servers that we had stopped repeatedly she simply said \"I'll have the boss lady come talk to them\". Well the boss lady never came and although the pancakes were taken off the bill no other discount nor apology was given for the poor service and horrible food. If you want soul food don't go here if you expect to actually eat. This was absolutely the worst food experience I have ever had.",

    "text": "First of all, the restaurant closes at 8 PM, not 9 as listed everywhere on the internet.  So, if you do not want to feel rushed while eating or told that \"it takes 25 minutes to fry chicken, so don't ask\" do not walk in at 7:30 as we did without knowing the True closing time.  We were looking for an authentic soul food restaurant and an off the strip experience but this was not it.  After being told what not to order, I opted for the baked chicken and two sides.  I've never gone to a restaurant where the meat comes out first, at least 10 minutes before the accompanying sides - oops, only one side was brought out, the other was being cooked.  At that point I told the waitress to keep the second side, by the time it would have arrived, the other food would have been finished.  The baked chicken was just OK - gravy was too peppery but then again to each his own.  Overall, the chicken was just ok nothing to run home and tell anyone about.  The one side I did get - greens were good.  My husband had pork chops and three sides - greens, cabbage & rice/gravy.  He stated the pork chops and rice gravy were salty the veggies were good.  Maybe this was not their best night but first impressions are lasting impressions.  The restaurant came highly recommended by locals who've never eaten in similar restaurants around the country.  I had so much hope but have no plans to return.",

(( this is a soul food restaurant!!!)) 4.The waitress did not give table service and we were only offered a refill when the bill was out on the table   As someone who grew up in Los Angeles I have ALWAYS been a supporter of M&Ms and frequently visited when I went home and have never been disappointed.

We were served grits from yesterday, as you can see they are not creamy and have many chunks. I really want to support black owned businesses, but ppl please we gotta do better. Food wait was super long, but glad we got our food first, even though we arrived at opening (10 am) we received our food around 11 -Mind you, we ordered as soon as we arrived.

Finally got seated after 10 mins of standing by the door. Gets seated and immediately I hear the other tables complaining about there food not being served and others that came in later than them being served before them. Ordered my food and so did the person I was with to only find out they were out of things on the menu. Get my food and boy was I disappointed the full size order of fish came with 2 slices of fish and 3 sides the fish was pretty good but the sides were terrible the red beans and rice looked old, the macaroni and cheese was terrible, and the greens taste like they had sugar in them. Then the table next to mine the woman had hair in her food. The cook comes out with dreads that weren't even in a net. I was disgusted I didn't finish my meal and the food was garbage.   Ps. The corn bread came in the shape of a pancake.",

    "text": "This is absolutely the worst customer service experience I have ever witnessed in my life. A group of six of my friends and I went to this restaurant after hearing great reviews. We were told there would be a 20-minute wait. No problem. After about 50 minutes to an hour we were finally seated. We sat at the table for over 20 minutes and witnessed The Waitresses seating several other tables and taking their orders but still had yet to come to our table. We politely asked why I order had not been taken yet because we had already been there over an hour. The waitress had no explanation so after sitting 10 more minutes we decided to get up and leave. A different waitress came outside and caught up with us and asked us to come back and apologized for the wait so we came back and sat down again. We waited another 10 minutes and finally our orders were taken. There were seven of us so of course it was a big order. 20 minutes later the same waitress comes back to our table and slams the receipt on the table and says the cook is refusing to make your order then she walks away!!!!!! Mind you at this point it had been well over an hour and a half we were never rude the entire time except to Simply ask why are order had not been taken it. There were plenty of reasons to act ignorant and make a scene but of course we never did. For absolutely no reason they refused our service because we we asked a time in being served. This was absolutely horrible customer service I don't care how good your food is you don't treat customers that way. They need to be shut down or get new owners or take classes on customer service because there's is SHIT!!! This is supposed to be a black owned restaurant too. I'm ashamed of them.",

Began to chat with two other customers who were already waiting and stated that they had been there for 15 mins, unspoken to but I still did not give up hope. Not long after a guy throws two menus on the table and says nothing ... the girl who was there already asked an employee if anyone was taking orders at the take out table and she then signaled to another employee who already looked busy out her mind. She proceeded to alert the female worker who has Made eyes contact since I walked in the door who came over to ask if we wanted drinks. The girl next to me replied that she just wanted to order and the worker told her that it's like \"10 tickets up there\" whatever that means. They left immediately and then I after another 2 minutes ... I'll enjoy these pancakes now that I could get anywhere ! And this is my first time in Vegas ever.. wow.",

You really can't go wrong with the kool-aid. Our waitress, Toni was really good and made our experience even better. I'd recommend it if you want good soul food.,",

The killer part was some man called ahead to confirm our order and they still screwed it up! $108 for burnt fried chicken, cheeseless macaroni and cheese, tough ribs, and disguisting oxtails. We were charged for things we didn't receive and food arrived cold. Will never order from here again. I can make better at home, so I definitely feel a way paying $100 for this crap :/",

The sausage links were greasy and I couldn't finish them. Hey, probably my fault. I can't eat that stuff like I used too. The eggs were fine but either had too much butter or some cream or something in them. The biscuits were \"flat as a fritter\" and over cooked. It looked like they hadn't been proofed at all.   The grits were flavorless and obviously had been sitting in a warm pan for a while.   Staff was nice enough, but the place was dead on a Monday morning at 8:30 so they were just hanging out and BLASTING music. They did turn it down when asked.   I've said this on other reviews, maybe I'm just being too hard on the Southern fare places. I'm a native Georgian and perhaps my hopes are too high. I WOULD give them another chance for lunch though, probably.",

They used to be seasoned better. They decided to cut corners and it's not working. The ox tails taste differently depending on when you go. The hot water cornbread used to be hot and fresh served with butter. Now they bring you pre buttered cold bread. They don't seem to care as much. I'm sad because we used to come to this place every time we visited Vegas. It was a favorite. Now I feel like they can't out cook a good home cook",

She started the experience with a very passive attitude and when my friend found a hair on her plate, Ashley proceeded to pick out the hair in front of us and asked my friend \"are you sure this isn't yours?\". That was very rude of her to do that right in front of customers and not just simply take the plate back without any objections. The next time I come to this location I will request to be helped by Tashara, she always never disappoints when I visit this location. Also when a customer asks for tartar sauce with fried catfish, please never bring out the entire craft bottle and plop it on the table, that's pretty unprofessional. Next time put the tartar sauce in a small dish or bowl.",

An hour and a half after placing our order, still nothing. At this point we had finished our drinks and hadn't been asked if we need a refill. Server was no where to be found but the other servers were too busy joking around with each other. At this point, we were fed up. We went up to the counter and said we were not going to wait any longer. We had been there for almost two hours! They said our order was being plated and we were going to be getting it in less than a minute. Fast forward an additional 5 minutes, we FINALLY got our food! It was cold. We had a couple bites and then noticed a roach scaling the wall in the restaurant. It wasn't a very clean place. At that point, we were done. We went up to the counter to pay our tab and leave. First girl said she would be right back with our tab. 12 minutes later, another girl asked us if we had been helped. We asked for our check again. 5 minutes later, she said she couldn't find our bill. We told her what we had. We paid our bill and left. I would honestly go somewhere else! It's food poisoning waiting to happen. Good luck!",

They said the manager ran to the store to buy new ones. It was around 1:30 PM which is weird to be out of a very popular item in the middle of the day. So I finally got my chicken and waffles after 40 minutes and my waffle was horrible it was shaped like a pancake not a waffle it was doughy and Did not look like the others, as we all pretty much ordered chicken and waffles. I wanted to send it back but I knew it would take too long. I have also ordered a side of mac & cheese greens and yams to go for later. I truly wanted to cancel this order but it was already ready when it was time to go. While we were sitting down there were two fights that happen both with a customer and a server. The server was full-blown yelling back at the customer it was madness. One couple went to pay they stood there for 30 minutes and no one took their money so they walked out. So it was time for us to pay we didn't want any more water we just want to leave and another argument broke out. People were sending food back left and right they were completely unsatisfied. So I took my food we left. I ate my sides maybe a few hours later. A few hours after that I threw all of it up. How horrible is that. I then text my friend this morning to tell him that I threw up only for him to tell me he threw up his sides too. So I will never be eating at M&M's again. And I would advise anybody against it as well.",

    "text": "As a Southern born/bred woman one thing I know is soul food. I was excited to visit this place and I had seen/heard so much about it. It's right across from the Stratosphere so it was just down the strip from the Bellagio where we stayed. Upon walking in it's pretty low key and clean. Tons of employees working in the back and there was an older gentleman who greeted us right away. We ordered at the counter where we found out there would be a wait so we left our number and walked to the casino across the street. The wait was 30-40 minutes for fried chicken, snapper, greens, black eyed peas and Mac n cheese.  We got our food to go so we were famished by the time we were able to eat. TBH none of the food is seasoned well and I could've kept my $38+. Only hot sauce saved the wings, the breasts were a little GMOish IMO and all of the sides remained mostly uneaten. I also got a slice of red velvet cake and while it wasn't bad it didn't taste familiar at all. Because of the flavor and the cost of ubering to the spot I would not return. I could've had a burger and fries and been more satisfied with my meal for a fraction of what I paid here. Pros: The employees seemed really nice and attentive and the place is clean and well maintained just look out for the dispensary people next door asking for mula.",

It is just a mass of confusion from the moment you walk in until you are seated........They have really improved lately on the ordering process, it used to take forever to order and get your food, but lately they are much more improved on the timing, so hopefully they will get the seating issue under control next....... The food though....solid four stars, all the time..... The Fried Chicken is my husbands favorite, and he likes the collard greens, mac & cheese for the sides.  I like the red beans and rice appetizer. It comes with a full hot link plus, hot link cut up in the beans. This appetizer is really a full meal.  The corn bread is amazing!!!!!!",

I waited for about 30 minutes and couldn't wait any longer for a table so I proceeded to the bar. I get there and saw crumbs and trash all over the counter. The waitress finally told me after waiting another 10 mins that the bar was closed. She did me a favor because I walked out to find some more decent food in a much cleaner and welcoming establishment. I wish I had taken pics because you can't even begin to imagine just how filthy this place was.",

    "text": "It's sad that the first review I write on this site is a bad one. If you are going to put your restaurant on the Las Vegas strip your establishment should be up to par. Unfortunately this place doesn't hold up. When my friend and I arrived on a Saturday evening it was slow and we we seated quickly. Our server took a little too long to arrive to take drink orders. It was understandable as she was training someone. They were both very nice though.      Things went downhill from there unfortunately. service from the kitchen was super slow. The hot water cornbread they brought it as we waited was terrible and over cooked. I ordered the half order pork chop dinner with cornbread dressing and greens. The pork chop was pretty good but on the small side. I've had better ant many other soul food restaurants and my mom's house. The sides however, were awful. The cornbread dressing was super wet and almost soupy. The greens had an extreme amount of black pepper. My friend ordered the full catfish meal with Mac and cheese, yams and string beans. It was a complete disaster. The fish was fried too hard, the Mac and cheese was dry and the string beans and yams were cold. I forced my meal down but my friend couldn't even finish her meal. It was taken off the bill, but when she asked to lodge a complaint to the manager, they refused to come out and talk to us. Very unprofessional.       I want to support black businesses, but when you treat your own people like this and serve less than mediocre food, it a shame that I have to write a review like this in order for you to do better. And get someone's granny to go in the kitchen and whip them into shape.",

Tonisha my server, greeted me and sat us.   Then after I asked Tonisha if breakfast was still being served. She proceeded to tell me breakfast was over at 10:45am when I know that breakfast should be over at 11:00am. After recanting her statement about breakfast being over she left my table to take someone else's order that arrived after my family. That rude gesture was only second to her purposely waiting until after 11:00am so much so that I had to get up and locate her manager to take our order and inform us that breakfast was over yet again.   Needless to say I voiced my disgust with the matter and promptly took my family and left. Never to return to this location again.   It is a sad shame that when we as a people try to support black business and give back to the community and we are treated with such contempt and disregarded with complete disrespect.",

    "text": "Came here on a random Thursday night with a friend.  This restaurant is in one of the sketchier parts of town located near the Stratosphere, but my friend and I continued on in the name of food.  The restaurant itself is quite large and plainly decorated, it looked like this place could use a good sweeping too with straw wrappers/crumbs littering the floor.  We were greeted and seated right away.  Our server was friendly but not the most attentive (ex. forgot to bring out coffee requested).   However, what saved our opinion of this restaurant was the food!  We ordered: -Chicken Waffles ($10.99) - People you need to get this!  I about died from joy when I put the crispy on the outside, yet juicy on the inside fried chicken (3 pieces) in my mouth.  The waffles were so fluffy and delicious, I was so sad that it only came with 2 waffles.  This was definitely the stand out dish out of everything we ordered.  Get this and enjoy the savory sweetness of this dish.  -Baked Chicken ($9.99 for Half Portion Size) - My friend ordered this and I had some of hers.  The baked chicken was smothered in a tasty BBQ sauce and the chicken was so tender that it literally fell off the bone.  The mac and cheese side was decent but the red beans and rice side dish was a little on the bland side.  -Cornbread (free!) - Came out warm and delicious, no complaints here especially since it was free. -Kool-Aid ($2.75) - Really good, but this was literally diabetes in a cup...just keep in mind they put a lot of sugar in it.   I'm torn between giving this place a 3 star rating and a 4 star rating, if I could I would give it 3.5 stars.  Yeah this place was a little dingy and dirty and our server forgot a couple of things, but the food knocked it out of the park for me.",

This review is based on service alone because we never even got seated before we decided to leave. It was like a bad movie scene walking in,  there were 4 cooks sitting around at a table still in aprons, 1 server yelling in the window for her food before she finally asked who the f**k is cooking her food & all the cooks just shrugged & 1 walked back in the kitchen. We were told it'd be a 45 minute wait on a Tuesday afternoon at 3pm with only 3 tables in the restaurant. We waited for about 30 before we just left and said never again. We live in Houston & appreciate good home style food but I don't care how good your food is if your service is this awful.",

Was ignored for about 15 mins finally ordered a half order which contains one short rib and two sides after waiting an hour for the food the waitress was rude and nasty. The food was disgusting Mac and cheese horrible the greens were hard like they weren't boiled. Horrible customer service on top of bad food. My stomach was hurting the rest of the night. Dnt go to the one on the strip the one on Charleston is way better better service better food. They need to fire everyone on Las Vegas cooks included. The light skin pretty girl i guess owners wife is horrible her attitude stinks and to think she call herself helping she might as well count the books if she doesn't like working with ppl pretty girl shitty attitude.

    "text": "Not much to really say about this place. You wait all day recieve medicore service. All of the servers here need to be fired. I understand a wait to be seated that comes with any restaurant however once im seated i expect to be acknowledged by someone. It took 20 to 30 minutes for someone to take a drink order. And the girl asked us how long have we been sitting here. After another 30 mintues our drinks came. Got the chicken and waffles.  Another 30 minutes goes by and we get the waffle and there seems to be hair in the waffle. We bring to our waiters attention and she says its from the paintbrush they use to grease the wafflemaker. So you know there is a problem however you refuse to address and correct the problem. You instead want to continue to have your patrons continue to eat bristles. And to top it off you want people to vote for your  Business as the best of la but you havent put in the work to be the best. I felt like i should have been serving my own table and getting my own drink. Im only giving two stars cuz the koolaid was on point.",

    "text": "Really dig this place. I may go back there for breakfast on my last morning in town! Looking through reviews, it's a really mixed bag. Seems folks have issues with a person, a wait, go on a bad day and so they give it one star. I call B.S. This place is a solid 4 as far as I\"m concerned.  Left the hotel in search of breakfast my first morning. Walked by this place but kept on walking because I had a destination mind (thanks Yelp!). Somehow I couldnt locate it. I managed to find the hotel it sits in but still once inside got turned around. Was in a mood so just huffed off. I probably walked 40 minutes, passing nothing of consequence but managed to leave the largest souvenier shop in the WORLD spending only a few $.  By the time I headed back around towards my hotel, I was famished and even more annoyed. Cut to the moment I once again saw this beacon across the street. All of a sudden everything fell into place. Breakfast was over but I'm not the biggest chicken and waffle fan anyway. But I AM the biggest fried chicken and sides fan in the world!  I was one of a few white folks in there. Any jew who eats chinese food (which btw is EVERY jew) knows that's how you know whether or not you should eat there. And I bet the white people were all southern. I hope I don't get in trouble for this one, as my loud mouth often gets me.  I really enjoyed my chicken. Crispy, moist (that word!) and deliscious. Cooked perfect. I've never had corn cakes before and I am in LOVE! Please give me these every day and I will never eat a pancake again. Mashed potatoes was great. The green beans were canned which wasn't awesome for me, so I asked instead for collard greens. I will admit I did not love them, but the caveat is that I'm still new to collard greens and sometimes I like them, sometimes not. Still trying to figure out why and since I don't cook them it's harder.  The decor is kinda cafeteria and bare bones with some cool stuff on the walls. The place on Friday around 11 was fairly busy but many seats were still open in the front area as it's a big space! All this for just $10 for the two pieces and sides. No way! YES! Love M & M cafe!",

    "text": "It's my 1st time eating at M&M Soul Food and service as we can see is horrible. We were seated immediately however no one approached our table to see if we wanted anything to drink. We sat there for about 10 maybe 15 mins before a waitress walked over. Prior to that a waiter by the name of Brett was at the service window and looked out at the tables. He looked right at us and totally ignored us. A waitress by the name of Relly walked over asked if we've been helped..we told her no and she apologized for it. She took our order and left. A couple gets seated to my left and they get immediate service by Brett. Maybe they're regulars here but...service shouldn't be that way. Our order was placed a while before they sat down and they received their order before ours even came out. I ordered the chicken and waffle and my hubby ordered shrimp and grits. Even though service was bad...we had hoped for our meals would make up for it. When our food finally arrived...it looked like they just threw it on a plate and called it food. 6 pieces of small shrimp in a big bowl of grits surrounded by oil ($13.99) and 3 pieces of chicken wings and a soggy waffle ($13.99) 2 jars of rootbeer ($2/jar) wasnt even refilled once. $34 meal with crappy service and food not worth the $$$ was not what I had expected. I would have preferred to go to McDonalds and spend $34 there. At least I know I'd get better service. All in all....customer service was an all time low and food was not to our expectations. We will never be back again.",

Some came as small as the bottom of a drinking glass and some came the size of a small pancake. Also, I was quite disappointed with this location. The lobby chairs need to be replaced. I had a back injury and couldn't sit down because the cheap plastic chairs are worn out. Instead of being upright, they are now slanted towards the ground. So, I had to go outside and sit on a cement ledge on what I think was the patio. I went to the bathroom which smelled horrible and when I touched the top of the stall, it was extremely dusty as if it had not been cleaned in months. It took 5 times before the toilet would flush the tissue paper. The food is good but, atmosphere is everything. Take it to go.",

The dressing tasted like jiffy mix crumbles and lacked flavor. The liver was no longer breaded. They ran out of food.  The staff was kind however I noticed that they began turning ppl away at 810p when the restaurant closes at nine. I do appreciate the freshness of the food however something has changed drastically.",

We waited to be seated about 25 minutes! We knew from then on it was gonna be a disaster.  Finally, a young lady seats us and the table is not cleaned, so we had to wait for her to wipe it down. That's the second red flag. She then takes our drink orders and didn't return with them until 17 minutes later! No lie cause i kept track of the time. Yup! Petty i know, but i wanted to be accurate with my review. Third red flag, after bringing the drinks 17 minutes later she walked away and didn't come back for another 21 minutes. In the meantime we've reached out to the other waiters walking around gossiping, but they stated they can't take orders for other people tables! Wtf?   I know, we should've left 60 minutes ago but we didn't. So, the waiter FINALLY came back to take our order. The food took 56 minutes to come out to us and do you know the food wasn't even HOT?! Do you know we all ordered greens and they brought us our plates with cabbage and green beans because they ran out of greens!! Who does that? The pork chops was over cooked and under seasoned, my fried said her fish was okay, my other friend said her rice and gravy was cold as well.  First of all, why would you bring me something i didn't even order ? And why wouldn't you tell us 56 minutes ago y'all didnt have no greens?! We were all disgusted and disappointed in the service and the food. We didn't get out of this dump until almost closing. I WILL NEVER PATRONIZE HERE AGAIN! And the bill was well over a 100 bucks too.",

The service was ok but the food I could have made at home. My toast came with no butter on it. The grits, kool-aid and the homemade biscuits were the only things that where good here. My plate looked like a bird picked at it and served it to me. I don't see what the hype is about of this place. How does the waitress have band aide on her forehead? You get into a fight boo boo? Why does the manager have a gun on his hip tho?  The picture below are real SALMON CROQUETTES! Get cha weight up!! This places get a negative -5 Stars  Will never come here again!!!!!

Not busy, though I did notice most of the empty tables were still dirty and hadn't been wiped down, including the first two they tried to sit us at. This is not the location I normally go to, but the one on Charleston is being renovated. It's been two years since I've visited this restaurant, and its just not the same anymore. The portions seem smaller, prices have increased but this may be because of where it's located(it's on LV Blvd)  but even the taste of the food is different. The catfish and snapper is breaded in a batter much blander than before, that amazing lemonade I was looking forward to was waaaaay too sweet, I think someone may have overdone it on the sugar with that batch. The green beens and potato salad are still great, corn cakes have gotten significantly tiny and not the same sweet crunchy recipe they had before. Really loved this place before, I used to take my fam here all the time but all the things I liked about it have changed so this visit was kinda disappointing. The staff were still friendly and attentive, chatted with us, So that is still awesome  I gave dessert a try, Peach Cobbler here is served cold and soggy, just not quite what you'd expect, where is the love?",

    "text": "This is by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had to date. I'm talking ABSOLUTE WORST! I would definitely give this place 0 stars if I could. Mind you I'm from Los Angeles and I grew up on M&Ms soul food, so I felt like I already knew what to expect. I walked in and placed a TO-GO order (fried chicken, Mac n cheese, greens, rice and gravy) nothing major. Asked the waitress how long the wait would be and she said \"about 15 minutes\". So I decided to step outside because they DJ was too loud for my liking and I was honestly bothered by the mounds of dirty dishes that were stacked on countless tables throughout the restaurant (red flag #1) . About 20 minutes later I come back in and my food still isn't ready. At this point I take a seat because I'm assuming my food should be ready shortly. Another 15 minutes passes, then another 20 and my food STILL wasn't done nor anyone else's to-go orders. By this time people were asking for their money back and LAWD I wish I would have done the same but I was hungry and my hotels was literally across the street. Finally, a WHOLE HOUR LATER, my food was ready. I should have checked my order before I left, but I was so eager to leave their establishment that I darted out of the door pissed off. My order was incomplete. I was missing a chicken wing, the mac n cheese was definitely boxed brand and generic. They looked NOTHING like the photos of the Mac n cheese from other peoples reviews. If y'all ran out, just say that!  I literally received two small spoon fulls of rice and gravy and greens. The food left much to be desired. It was very under seasoned and bland. I was beyond disappointed. I do not recommend eating here at all. Oh, the dishes were still sitting on the table before I left too so I'm guessing there isn't a busboy/girl on staff. My people have got to do better!",

So we go in and wait...still waiting ** no one acknowledging us** meanwhile we are still waiting. . Finally a man (who I believe to be the owner) tells us to sit down in the WAITING area in no particular order.. finally we leave... unfortunately I can't say how the food is, cause I never got to eat",

Service was kinda good but kinda slow Some of the food was cold Greens were really bad. Beans n rice - ok.  Cabbage- ok.",

After I was seated, I waited 15 minutes before my drink order was taken. It took another 15-20min to get my food order. After waiting 40+ min for my food I finally had enough and offered to pay for my drinks. They kindly (sarcasm) gave them to me on the house. I should also say, I am a lighter skinned Mexican and felt I was not treated the same as the other customers. There was a family next to me who got in after and were treated like a customer. I definitely do NOT recommend this place. If you want a place that treats you like a customer and human being try the Gritz Cafe, they're service is superb and food is even better. They do get wait times but that is food worth waiting for.",

Well, I regret to admit that the food here is overlooked by rude service. Some of the girls that work here need a reality check. It's customer service not just serving food. My server happened to be very good. It was the other one who really got under my skin. And, this is the second time I've dined here and witnessed the same service. You have to do better .",

No one greeted us until after we waited anout 10 minutes when a guy appeared and asked did you sign yourself in. The servers were moving with urgency but just not tbe level of service I expect.   I had smothered pork chop, greens, yams and fried okra. It was decent but lukewarm. The okra and corn cakes were the best. My son had fried chicken, mac n cheese, yams & greens. Chicken, greens and yams were tasty however they ran out of  mac n cheese so no comment other than better food prep for orders.   The service and quality of food was not worth the cost!

The furniture looks like something from a yard sale for the owner to say the place is \"new\". The waiting area was literally two rows of fold out lawn chairs . Now on the the food. The food is definitely no worth the money and they over cooked the fish. The fish was fried to the point where it's was just batter . I understand trying to \"save money\" but when you have a business, under cutting your customers is not the way to go . My friends snapper looked like 1 filet cut in half again!  My fish was one small little filet .I was so disappointed with my plate I instantly returned it . The owner came out to speak with us and offered to compensate our horrible experience with a discount . The discount was a gracious 3% off !! That's not even tax! This place is ridiculous and a disgrace to the name and brand \"M&M soul food\" I'm so pissed & disappointed !!!",

We peeped in the window and said let's give it a try.   The decor is simple nothing to brag about. The staff are slightly disorderly but I think it was due to the rush. With the rush going we were just pointed to our seats versus being walked over. The server Jaayvon was nice and courteous and everything was bought out hot and fresh.   So let's talk food. Well breakfast ends at 12:00 but they actually have a cut off around 11:40 which was slightly disappointing but chicken and waffles are served all day. I was in the mood for French toast however but it's okay. The chicken and waffles were very good. Chicken was cooked well and the waffles are wheat but delicious.  I do think they still have some work to do with the customer service aspect so overall I give it 3 stars and would come again to see if they have progressed with the level of service.",

We arrive around 1220p (2/19/18) greeted and seated immediately. Received our drinks then orered our food. 20 mins pass still no silverware, and noticed this older couple mentioned to waiters it's been 40mins and still no food. RED FLAG WE IGNORED. Here we are at 1:11p STILL NO FOOD almost an hr. 10mins after that food arrives cold. Hubby had salmon croquets made with very little salmon and too much egg. He asked for \"over easy/med.\" Eggs which is not RUNNNYYY. I had another pork chops breakfast.   This wait was crazy... to find out the ORIGINAL COOL DIDN'T COME TO WORK, AND THEY HAD THE DISHWASHER GUY COOKING.... so I was told by waitress..  Saying sorry for the wait after we were ready to pay! Should be been mentioned before seating us.",

Arrive there and it took the cook man to get us a table because the the waitress (5 of them where too busy in their gossip and not interested in providing customer service.  So thanks to the cook my other half and I got a table and he was very polite and and show a smile as he was leading us to our table. 10 minutes go by and not one came by to take out order so I look around and there were only 3 table  1 already had their order and where almost done, 2nd Family of 2 it their meals and now we where next and one more family was just walking in and Still no one came over to our table to take or order, not even a glass of water...!  Maybe is time to retrain waitress on providing customer service and promote the cook to be the next manager in charge of running this location...! He try not ones but 3 times telling the waitresses to take care of us and they just gave us a look and and one of the girls response was \" is ok I'll get to you when I'm ready\" they they continue with their personal conversation of what went on the night before.  So e walk out from this restaurant with no plans to return to this location.",

Luckily our server was really good when we got seated. Chicken was excellent and so was the dressing. The mac and cheese wasn't good at all. Very dry. Loved the kool-aid and sweet potatoes! I actually visited twice in one trip to las vegas. My second visit I tried the \"cat fish filets\" this is where they lost me at. It DEFINITELY is not catfish they are selling swai and calling it catfish. Very deceiving. The swai fish taste nothing like catfish its not even similar in texture to me. Maybe if I didn't know any better I wouldn't be able to tell, but I can so that was super gross and cheap on they part.",

I was here from California looking for good soul food and found this place on Yelp. They have a big space filled with lots of empty seats and we still had to sit over 10mins w/o being acknowledged. Not until a cook way behind the counter told us to have a seat. For this place to be so close to the stripe it definitely doesn't offer an environment that attracts the many different tourist here in Vegas. Good luck staying in business FYI the menu prices on yelp are completely different snd higher from the menu prices in the store",

Reading the reviews wasn't great but my boyfriend insisted we try it out anyway. Once we got there, the line was OUT the door on a Saturday afternoon. It was so worth the wait. We got seated n served. It was very busy. I had the fried chicken and he had the snapper. Both amazing. Drinks were koolaid, lemonade or sweet tea. All homemade. Music playing was old school jams. It was like being back at grandmas house eating Sunday dinner. So glad we decided to go n I will def be back. !!",

I never heard of it but Hubby said he did and it was great! So detour from the Monorail into this sweet place. Looked in and saw lots of beautiful brown faces which confirmed this place might have some Soul for real! Well, it was good every thing is made to order. I thought my mac n cheese was on the bland side. I had great side of okra and the BBQ chicken which was juicy, hot and fresh. The hudband devoured his mash potatoes with gravy, corn and smothered chicken. The sweet tea had an off set taste, but i think it was because they use A LOT of cane sugar, so got Kool-aid (yes its on the menu) it was sweet too but the sweet we love!",

The fried chicken was pretty decently seasoned, the macaroni was basically boxed (I mean seriously a soul food place without baked macaroni deserves multiple stars off for that alone lol.) I ended up going here twice during the stay, the service was pretty slow after our initial order the we put out the search party for our waitress and it wasn't that busy. The worst thing about this place is the location, it's pretty much zombie central, run-down hotels around, from drunks to ppl on drugs everywhere, maybe a prostitute or two passing by and the pool next door that I starred at during my meal was just beautiful with its dark greenish/brown water, filled with baby pampers to beer bottles, not really their fault but hey it's there right?",

If you like Oxtails or have had oxtail soup, I'm certain that these will be the best that you have had so tender and meaty they come right off the bone.  The pork chitterlings are also very very good for those who eat them. If you don't eat them but wanted to try them, this would be the place to do it.   The gravy they make is also top notch.  I sampled the collard greens, okra, red beans and rice and yams, all were very good.  A little corn bread pancake comes out with every meal.  The portions come in full and half sizes, the full sizes can probably be shared so you leave room for dessert.    The only negative part of the experience would be the climate in the restaurant during the summer months can be a little warm for some but that doesn't take away from a great soul food restaurant that is on the strip.",

Check the utensils we had to ask for plastic dishes were dirty ughhh..

I along with my 6 dining companions were seated finally. But the table we were seated at was still being cleaned. The person who was doing the cleaning didn't even bother to excuse himself while reaching over myself and my dining companions. Any how our drink orders were taken, and brought to us. Not too long after that, pancakes, oops I mean hot water cornbread was served. I've never seen cornbread look like a pancake, and I never want to again. Give me a nice thick piece of cornbread, not a flat pancake to eat my greens with. I liked my food, but I didn't love it. The service wasn't bad either. They could use some more customer service training tho. The smothered chicken I had was good, the gravy too. The greens were on point, but the mashed potatoes tasted more like chunky potatoes, with gravy.",

We never once felt rushed. And the food was great. I grew up eating food like they serve so I'm not easily impressed but it was much like to remembered! Nothing was sitting under a light.

The parking is almost nonexistent... A few spots on the side of the restaurant. But it's a much larger dining room and the restroom was very clean.  We got there on a Sunday around 10:30am and decided to have breakfast.... We later decided that maybe we should have chosen the iHop across the street.  After placing our order, we realized that there was a group of about 12 people seated behind us. Each one of them got their food.... One plate at a time.... Our waitress came by after about 45 minutes to tell us that our food was \"next\"....   After about 10 more minutes, the people at the next table joked with us that \"they must have had to kill a hog to get your breakfast\"..... they had been served and were finished eating before we got any food  I ordered the omelet and pancakes.... Omelet came with a biscuit sliced in half. Half order of pancakes was two.... They were large with warm syrup. The pancakes were whole wheat, with a touch of cinnamon... If this had been described on the menu, I wouldn't have ordered them.... But they were nice and tasty, as was the omelet.  My husband ordered the Denver omelet with hash browns. Again, the omelet came with one sliced biscuit, so I gave him mine. The potatoes, priced at $2.50, came out on a saucer and looked to be about 2 ounces!   One other thing.... Proofread your menu! There is no such thing as a \"salmon crochet\"! LOL try \"croquette\"....  We think the problem is that there needs to be more help in the kitchen.... Maybe they had only one cook who was cooking one order at a time.... We'll probably give this one more try but will probably drive out to the Charleston location if we see no improvement.",

The menu isn't large but I order the classic chicken and waffles. The BEST chicken and waffles I've ever had. Food came exceptionally fast, was fresh and steaming hot!! I'd have taking a picture but it was so delicious that I devoured it within minutes. I also had their koolaid! Delicious and free refills:) Truely enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and exceptional service!!",

We also loved that they gave us a free starter of cornbread pancakes... Absolutely yummy! I could eat those pancakes everyday! It's also rather reasonably priced as compared to all the restaurants in casinos. The service was great as well - our waitress was very friendly and attentive and our food was served within 10 minutes, but that could be because we had an early dinner at 5pm. It's quite conveniently located opposite the IHOP near the Stratosphere, so you could easily get there by taking the northbound monorail along the Strip! However, 2 of my friends had that and were rather disappointed by the small size of the fish, so I would definitely go for the chicken instead!",

I got the half order so maybe whole order had less batter and more fish. I thought about ordering the chitterlings but saw a Hispanic couple send theirs back so I passed. Ordered wings to go and they were great. Chicken on other tables looked good too. Plenty of ho cakes to help fill you up..",

Everyone working was really polite its black and white with a big chicken in the front and tons of gram worthy photo ops. the food! I think they have changed ownership/management my corn cakes were dry and that's normally the first thing everyone talks about, my chicken and fried fish was delicious, however green beans looked & tasted  like it came from a can and my yams weren't roscoe status or anything special, mac & cheese dry but I did appreciate it didn't break my pocket, service was great and environment diverse.

This place had terrible customers service my girlfriend, her friend, and I were seated at the bar for at least 20 minutes no one gave us menus, acknowledged us, offered us water or anything. Then we were rudely asked to move to a table because apparently the bar area was for takeout mainly. Mind you to the right of me there was a guy vigorously enjoying his meal lol.   The beauty of soul food is its filling, delicious, and won't hurt your pockets too much. This place does not fit that criteria the prices are way too damn high!

There's no pop or boom in decor and things only seem to have been dropped and placed randomly . The huge chicken statue in the lobby doesn't make sense. Some tender love and care, wouldn't hurt. The men's bathroom was dirty as well. I ordered Chitlins, macaroni and cheese, yams, cornbread and black eyed peas. The sides were delicious! My server Brett was a complete sweetheart! The Chitlins' were disgusting. They smelled horrible and weren't as cleaned as they should have been. Whatever seasoning they use does nothing for the horrible smell. I'm aware that Chitlins have a strong stench, but that's why you cook them with chopped onions, and a whole potato in the pot. Thus the 4 star review. I'll be back, but not for the Chitlins, or a clean bathroom.",

    "text": "A friend from Seattle recommended this place. We attempted to dine here twice. The first attempt was on a Friday afternoon, the parking lot on the Las Vegas Blvd. location is tiny and there's a motel next door that's under construction so I'm not sure if after/before the construction there were more stalls. We attempted the second location on West Charleston, which was closed. We didn't stick around to check if they were going to open at a later time so we left and got some ramen somewhere promising ourselves that we had to try M&M. The successful attempt was the very next day around 1pm which was a Saturday. When we arrived there was one parking stall left so we knew it was meant to be! The food Gods have spoken. Checked in with the host and was told it would be a 30 minute wait to be seated, fine.  We waited less than 30 for our table, while we waited a member of their staff took our drink order and was happy to bring it to our table as we got seated while he prepared it. Cool.  We knew what we wanted so ordering wasn't a big deal, kids split the chicken & waffles and a side of Mac & cheese, I had a half order of fried catfish, collard greens and fried okra, and the mister had the full order of fried pork chops, beans & rice, collard greens and mash. The food took a while, but we knew this fact before we attempted to try this place. It was about an hour. Between ordering and getting our entrees, we were offered two plates of hot cornbread & butter, as well as refills on our Kool aides and sweet teas.  All staff members were very courteous and friendly, they apologized for the wait and thanked us for our patience. Our food arrived shortly after they served us the second plate of corn bread. Collard greens were sweet, fried okra was crispy and hot, my catfish was moist and crunchy! The fried pork chop was soooo good, we wished we ordered a third piece or side order of them. Waffles were cinnamon-ie and less dessertish than I'm used to which was cool with my little one. The chicken, omg the chicken! It was crispy without too much batter and moist, not dry at all!  During this trip, I visited the restroom once and it was alright. Not as clean as I'd like but I've also seen worse. The dining room was spacious and bright, with a couple smaller TVs mounted on the wall. They had smooth R&B music playing in the background. Oh and there's a very large chicken at the entrance. It's definitely one of those hole-in-the-wall type places that gets lots of business. The customer traffic hadn't even died down by the time we were done with our lunch which was around 3pm. People were still waiting for tables and the parking was full when we left.  The husby and I both agreed that we'd be back and that it was worth the wait. Oh and in case you're wanting to do a take out order, they have signs stating that the seating wait and take out wait are pretty much the same. Probably because they are very fair in that they serve you as you come in and in order. No cut-sies people! Lol!  I gave them 5 stars because we already knew what we were in for regarding the wait. The food was fresh, and the customer service was awesome!",

The waiters never greeted the table. We sat for 30min before we got water. Total wait time for awful food 1 hour 30 min. Why didn't we leave you asked???

Sides included red beans & rice , Mac & cheese , gravy & rice , corn , yams , potato salad .  We didn't find out until a hour later that they were out of collard greens which many of us ordered and they were out of shrimp & grits.   FYI you ordered the a half order of catfish/snapper you get a very small piece. I suggest ordering the full order.   THE GOOD: The food was absolutely amazing none of our party had any complaints about the food and the Kool-Aide was like your grandma use to make when you were a child .   If you can deal with the long wait and subpar service then definitely go. If not try another Soul Food spot.   The Good: The food was",

Our server was really nice and accommodated all of our needs. The food took a little while. The food came nice and fresh. I ordered a thigh with the waffle and a side of corn bread. The food was pretty good. The waffle was soft. The chicken was crunchy on the outside & juicy inside.  The place wasn't big but not small either. It was a little dark inside too. The bathrooms need to be kept clean.   Overall, I would come back again if I'm ever close by and craving some delicious breakfast.",

Small white building said M&M Soul Food Cafe. Leosha was our server. Friendly and busy. She was waiting on several tables and still gave quality service.  John and I shared Crispy Fried Chicken; Sinfully Delicious Candid Yams, Collard Greens, Black Eyed Peas & Cabbage. Man do I miss My Mother's Cooking.  Great Soulful Music Playing in The Background.

Make your way to the ole downtown Vegas area near the SLS Casino and the Stratosphere Casino and you will come across a little shopping district and a slew of wedding chapels. Right before all the soon-to-be-divorced-shops, you'll find M&M Soul Food Cafe across from an iHop. Offering an interesting choice of breakfast items that you find find from your standard restaurant, M&M blends cultural favorites to bring you unique and mouthwatering menu items you don't often come across at a great low price.   Definitely a great place to stop in for early for breakfast, brunch, or lunch and keeps you on a budget that can easily feed two people for under $20. Opted for a cheese omelette with a few strips of bacon and a fresh and buttery biscuit washed down with fresh orange juice poured into a mason jar glass. Cheese was dripping off the top of them omelette and oozing out the middle, just the way I like it and the bacon found it's way onto those buttery biscuit with precision accuracy into my pie hole. Highly recommended for those seeking a cheaper breakfast from all the casino and resort options with a quiet atmosphere and friendly staff.",

For sides, I got the cabbage, greens, and macaroni and cheese.  I can be picky about my macaroni and cheese, but this was absolutely the worst mac I've ever had.  It was basically like someone took Kraft mac and cheese, didn't cook the macaroni all the way, and used only a quarter of a packet of that fake cheese powder.  The cabbage smelled really old (I get it, I know what cabbage is SUPPOSED to smell like and i know it smells, but trust me on this one, guys).  I was scared to try the greens so..I didn't.  They could be good, but I honestly didn't get that far.  My boyfriend got the catfish and said it tastes like something out of the frozen section of the grocery store.  The potato salad side that he got was similar; no flavor and tasted like something from the grocery store deli.  He is a pescatarian and asked the waitress if the collard greens were cooked with any meat bc he can't have anything besides fish.  She said, \"No, no meat.  We cook it with turkey.\"  My definition of meat could be off but...isn't turkey meat? No?  The servers were nice and very helpful and aside from the food, they made the experience positive.  The place looks like a real hole in the wall on the inside and outside, but I don't hold that against them because hole in the wall soul food places usually have the best food!  It wasn't the case this time, aside from those pork chops.",

I said are you serious she says yep we are out of everything green. This was a problem because one person in our party could only eat the vegetables and meat no carbs. Since we didnt expect them to be out of lots of things we didnt have an alternate plan so we stayed. We waited and finally recieved the cornbread, I asked for butter and you guessed it they were out.. What the????  We finally got our food at 8:58.. worst experience ever. So sad cause we were so excited to eat here...",

    "text": "The food was great but, the service was terrible. They seemed like they were in a hurry to close although we arrived at least an hour before closing. We were initially seated on one side of the restaurant but, was moved to the other side because they were trying to close down that side. That wasn't the problem. After we were moved to the other side of the restaurant, our drink order was taken but, we didn't receive the drinks. Cornbread arrived and still no drinks and No waitress to take our order. We ask for some water at that point since they did bring us something to snack on. The water never arrived. Finally, our waitress arrives and takes our drink orders again (still no drinks at this point) and our food order. Our food finally arrives but, we still do not have our drinks. Oh, I forgot to mention, the waitress smells of weed when she's taking our orders. So, we finally get our drinks and most of our food has arrived. My son has no food. My daughter ordered the last of the ribs so, he now has to order something else on the fly. We still didn't get any water but the waitress brings us our bill and asks if we would like to take some drinks to go. When she comes back with our to go drinks, she now informs is that we cannot use our cards to pay the bill because the machine was down. Now, that would've been useful information when we first arrived, as we had already used most of our cash earlier in the day. After reading a few other reviews, the poor service seems a little common over the last few weeks but, the food is still great. Improve the service and 5 stars would not be a problem. Bad service makes people not want to come back. #mylittletwocents",

    "text": "Our first attempt to patronize this establishment was on Sunday evening. We were greeted outside by other patrons who told us that the wait was around two hours long. They also said the food was not worth the wait. They said their mother cooked better food. We went inside and saw how many people were sitting around like they were waiting to be seated and decided to go elsewhere. Monday afternoon we tried again. This time we walked in but wasn't sure where to go because no one greeted us at the door. We saw people sitting in chairs that looked like they were waiting to be seated so we asked them what we were supposed to be doing. They were actually there for job interviews so they didn't know. One man behind the bar did tell me that he would be with me after he waited a table. But he never came back. Someone who was dressed up and look like they may be a manager or owner asked me if I had been helped yet. I told her no and she quickly got someone. She thought I was there for a job interview at first. We were given menus and told we could sit anywhere we wanted. We ordered Chicken and Waffles and had muddy water drinks. I'll have to rate the chicken and waffles at three stars. The chicken was fried well but not seasoned any particular way. Didn't have any type of flavor that would make you remember it. The waffle sort of tasted like gingerbread. Not sure but it wasn't awesome. It was just okay. The waitress was nice. The establishment itself was a little grungy and could use a facelift. There was a friendly gentleman who seemed to be an owner or manager that kept going around to different tables speaking with people to see how they were doing or if they liked the food. Overall I'd say this place isn't really worth the time it takes to get your food. It offers average food and a medicore dining experience.",

The flavors are subpar. Yams, macaroni and cheese, and cabbage had no flavor or spices at all. Yams tasted like they were straight from nature with no sugar. The cornbread pancakes or whatever were dry and tasteless. The $1.50 up charge for white meat chicken is ridiculous! Especially when the white meat is 2 chicken wings and a thigh! I cannot believe this crap. I feel like I was robbed. I used to frequent other locations in California, but this location has turned me off.",

We are very observant and noticed folks seated next to us after we were seated for 15 minutes.  They received their orders before us whole we waited another 20 min. After receiving our food, she abruptly placed toast (wrong type of bread) on the table and said \"oh sorry\".  The food looked like slop from a prison cell! The bacon was uncooked, potatoes looked like it was tossed in dirt and the eggs were tasteless slime. We received the cornbread cakes as an opener but it wasn't placed on our table until 20 minutes later after we arrived! My husband's dish was dried ass Mac and cheese and hairy ass fried chicken wings as if chickens mated with spiders to create their menu item (wtf)!We asked the broad for ketchup and she handed us a drop from what was left in the last ketchup bottle that was probably there when the restaurant opened and had to nerve to act as if we were inconveniencingher! That was the straw that broke the camels back. We were out of there. Foot left untouched and all! It is provably to your bests interest that you hire young ladies named Brittany or Mary not Kyesha or Respucha. So please don't go to the dark skinned sista with battle marks on her face that was created by a knife or machete. Peace!",

First we walk in and have to sign a book and write are own name and how many in our party then we waited about 10 min which was the only good thing, we got seated and we waited 35 min before anyone came to take a drink order...there was no silerware on the table...the hotsauce container was dirty, finally someone came to our table and ask us for our food order before asking us what we wanted to drink then she was called away and she left us once came back started to take our order then she was called again and left us again then she came back and continued the order she was called a thrid time and left us again by then i got up and ask for a manager i was told the only manager was the kitchen manager. Then we were told we only can take cash because the cc machine was down. So i cancelled my order because i had no cash so the kitchen manager came out i told him my complaint he said he would take care of my food that was nice however when the rest of the food came it was terrible and the waitress got our order wrong so when my free meal came out it was horrible the chicken was not cooked right the mac and cheese was cold and the yams were way to sweet so i didnt enjoy my free meal at all also the people i was with from out of town food was terrible. There was a waitress who saw we were upset and offered us free dessert that looked terrible..then on top of that the kitchen manager came out and cussed a customer out in front of everyone. It was a very terrible experience and the owner Tim should pay better attention to his new restaurant and train his cooks and waitress how to really run a restaurant. I went on Facebook and on google to tell people that my experience at mm on the strip was terrible and i wont go there again.",

I was told it was busy but the restaurant was no where near capacity. The server put in my order and told it would be long. 40 minutes later my food still hadn't arrived. I don't really write these but this place is ridiculous. Customer service is horrible here. Looks as if they don't even have a manager on the floor or even in the restaurant period. Being an African-American as well as Chef I was sorely disappointed in this place. I like to support black owned businesses but all to often I find that they lack what it takes to be in the service industry. If you want to make it in this business you need to invest in quality workers front and back of the house. This place lacks both and therefore I want be going back to this restaurant. You only get to strikes and this place has used three. I truly hope whoever owns this place fixes these issues and takes this post seriously.",

Waitress took our drink orders and brought us some flimsy corn cakes, before our meal. Confused as to why these aren't served with meal? Ordered smothered fried chicken, greens, mac n cheese and yams. Took about 30 mins for meal which was pipping hot. Mac n cheese was so so, yams and greens out of a can, how do they offer homestyle cooking? But use canned food?. Chicken was ok, big pieces a little on the salty side. Sorry to say that I wont return, and still left with a craving for some good ole \"home cookin\"",

    "text": "\"Needs A Little More Soul\"  ATMOSPHERE:  M&M's newest location on Las Vegas Blvd. is a bit more open and spacious than their Charleston location, Memorabilia of celebrities and sports legends decorate the walls, and if you wish, there is counter dining as well. Service for the most part was okay, but at times, spotty. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and call it working out the service kinks.  BITES/BEVERAGES:  Fried Chicken is my entree of choice.. This time, I went with a half order($9.99) being that they are new, and we also had plans to go check out a new ice cream spot for dessert that opened earlier that day. My Half order came with a couple of Corn Cakes two pieces of dark meat (I'm a leg and thigh man when it comes to fried chicken) and two sides. I got the Cornbread Dressing and Collard Greens and some Muddy Water to enjoy with my meal. Although on the smallish side, my chicken was pretty good, as was my sides, but again, not as good as the Charleston location.  CLOSING STATEMENTS:  I really do hope the kitchen and service staff can fine tune things because not only are they in a good strip location, they also have potential to serve up some tasty soul food like the flagship location does.  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  3  Chances of returning?  Nah, I'll stick to the other location...",

I walk in and am yelled to from across a counter, and seated at the counter, which was fine, except there was stuff in the way of where l was seated. I did not choose the seat. I ordered pork chop with mac and cheese and stuffing. Waitress never asked how l was, never check in on me while l ate. This was not the service l was seeing others receiving. I heard a lot of friendly banter, lots of \"whats your name\" \"how is your day\" Yes maam\" and \"yes sir\", even from my server. The only thing different with me was that l was the only white person there. I hope that is not why my service was horrible, but there is speculation. Pork chop was ok, not world famous good, so it makes me wonder why this place is world famous, maybe mediocrity at best and high price? Mac and cheese was bland and a bit chewy. The stuffing was better but nothing to remember. Could not even get the check in time, finally dropped some cash on the counter and left, l calculated that it was enough to barely cover the bill.",

Then the real wait began.  After a minute, I figured out what I wanted, I put the menu to the side and waited.  After a minute or two I picked up my phone and started surfing social media.  13 minutes later I got up and left...no glass of water, no place setting, napkin, what would you like to eat...nada even though I'm sitting at the counter.

The mashed potatoes were good, but the greens could've used a bit more salt. They served little corn cakes on the side which were outstanding.

My son ordered chicken and waffle and a side of macaroni and cheese. The order came out like a hr later. Waitress kept walking by apologizing saying it'll be out soon.  When she finally brought it out, she brings my plate, two bbq wings, yam and macaroni and cheese. Then she tells me there's no more white breast chicken so they went ahead and substituted the white chicken for two bbq chicken wings............without even asking me.  Sorry, but that's not okay. I didn't care for the bbq chicken wings because for one, that's not what I ordered. And two, it just looked unappetizing. I told the waitress I didn't want it. She rudely turns around and says, \"what don't you want?\" I didn't want any of it except the yam.   I came here because one of my sons football teammates parents recommended this place. Wish we would've just had dinner at the hotel instead.  Worse place I've dined at here in Vegas.   I do not recommend this place nor will I be returning.",

The wait although not extremely long is terrible because its so hot.  We went on a Thursday evening waited about 45 min and after being seated waiting at least 10 min for drinks and our order to be taken. We tried to not order fried food as there is a 25 min cooking wait time however they didn't have meatloaf so we ordered and waited Np..... Porkchop had pink in it and all our  sides were cold. We asked fof the sides to be heated up and the waitress said DAMN i dont have a microwave Ok well we cant have cold food she was pleasent said no problem and said ill see what i can do. She took the plates came back 10 min later with cold sides again we declinded and left. She did apologize .   We decided to give a second chance and came on Saturday afternoon . Quickly seated but not acknowledged for at least 15 min for drink order. Which we had to flag them down for. Chicken came put but was not cooked all the way Dressing is not cornbread dressing but its suffing like stove stop potato salad is dry and store bought is better . on the good note chittling good yams good and corn bread good.",

I didn't get the one thing I was excited for.. the Mac and cheese.. my boyfriend didn't get any of his sides. A member of our group didn't receive anything.. at all..  Another member of our party received the wrong order.   I had the chicken and waffles, when my food came I was excited because we had waited so long. I hate to say this, but it was not worth it..  the chicken could have used the slightest bit of salt...   I would not come back here. Too long of a wait and the food was subpar they are inconsistent in service and another table recieving all their food before us is definitely a no no",

The inside of the business was sketchy , I'm not sure if it's new or what but there was nothing inviting about semi-white walls and random tables.  Let's get to this food.  PROS:You Guys serve Johnny cakes with the meals that's awesome!! It was different but I could get with it and Im a traditional sweet cornbread type of gal. CONS: Sweet Potatoes ( missing vanilla flavor and nutmeg). They were sweet but missing the Spice. Greens-They were lacking in the flavor department  Red beans and Rice- why don't you guys try cooking the beans until they cream a little bit. You will still need some seasoning as they cook along with a good Andouille sausage. Speaking of Sausage: Nasty, please use something else. Covering it in barbecue-sauce isn't going to hide it.  If you go to this restaurant go with an open mind do not expect southern soul food that's not what's being served here sorry!! ((Insert shoulder shrug emoji))",

    "text": "Worst Customer service ever! When we walked in we were told to sit wherever. Which would have been fine except the only empty tables were dirty. So we waited about 5 minutes for them to clean a table off. We got sat directly in the sun so we asked to move tables. Which took another 25 minutes. During that time no one took our drink orders. We finally got seated and was told that our waitress would be right over. 5 minutes later she never came so the only helpful waitress working came back and took our drink and food order. We waited and waited still no drinks. We've been waiting for 50 minutes with no drinks at this point, not even water! At this point we asked for a manager. The manager was nice and worked on getting us our food and drinks. When we were explaining the situation to the manager one of the other waitresses who had an attitude problem chimed in and said well yea they didn't get served because they kept moving around. Her attitude and comments were completely unnecessary. After the manager stepped in we finally got drinks and our food came about 15 minutes after that. The table had no silverware so we asked one of the men there for a few forks and he said wow they really didn't do anything. The food was good, but not on the same level as their other location, the black eyed peas and red beans and rice were both bland. I will say the catfish was delicious. In the end they did try to make it better by comping our drinks and giving a percentage off of the meal. The manager and the girl who ended up serving us did apologize several times for the issues we had. Unfortunately until they can get their staffing issues in order I'll stick to the Charleston location.",

No one wants to patronize a business with nice-nasty people (people that pretend to be nice but comes off as nasty and really don't want to wait on you.).  They really need to train their staff better and have some respect and customer appreciation, if expecting to stay in business because the food is not all that.  At least at the Charleston location the staff is friendlier and the food is better.  I will give this location a second chance in a few months just to see if this is a serious business.

We are at the 40 minutes mark. I asked if we can at least have the pancake order brought out since it was for a child - and she says it's not ready. Really? How long does it take to make pancakes? There aren't free refills on orange juice so the waitress brings my son Kool-Aid. Kool-Aid and pancakes. Yup. Breakfast (soon to be lunch) of champions. This is way crazy to not be busy. The other tables that were in here with us have already been served. Luckily we aren't locals so we don't have to worry about returning here. Can't comment on how the food tastes- still haven't gotten it. Looks good though.  Update: We wound up leaving 10 mins later. The waitress came over and said she's not sure why it's taking so long. We said cancel the order and we'll pay for the orange juice. The waitress said don't worry about it and comped it. Cool. Whatever. Won't be back.",

    "text": "Admittedly I LOVE SOUL FOOD and my hips do too. So I was in Vegas last week and we decided to try this place on Thursday. Actually I think that it may have been Friday ( all my days run together in Vegas!) So our uber drops us off right out front around 2 pm. There is a line coming OUT of the door and the waiting area inside to the right was at capacity. As soon as we make it inside, the manager (older black man with glasses) starts hollering for us to 'CLEAR THE WALKWAY' as it is a fire hazard. Insert deep sigh. So we CLEARRRRRRRRRR the walkway and get our name on the list. Some gentlemen get up so that my friendgirl and I can sit down.   An energetic young waiter acknowledged that it was hotter than the hinges of hell and asked if any of us that were waiting wanted water and he brought us all water. I thought that was really nice. Meanwhile, people are still falling up in here (it was Hoodie award weekend and Omega Psi Phi conclave so I expected it to be really busy) I noticed several empty tables that were empty, however it took a long time for people to be seated at those tables, not sure if that was an oversight by whomever was in charge of the floor or what was going on with that.   As our wait nears 30 minutes, two men (I won't even refer to them as gentlemen) walk in and the manager puts their name on the list. About 3 minutes later, the manager calls a name on the list with no response. He walks away and says something to the energetic waiter that brought us the water. Then, the waiter walks over to the waiting area and says 'JONES?' Do you know that the two men that JUST PUT THEIR NAME ON THE LIST HOP UP AND GET SEATED ALL WHILE THE MANAGER JUST WATCHES FROM THE BAR AREA?!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF?!!!!!!!! Like you KNOW they just came in. I decided NOT to say anything because I know that there are some men who don't give a fcuk about disrespecting women and I didn't want to put myself in that position. SHAME ON THE MANAGEMENT FOR ALLOWING THAT TO HAPPEN.   About 10 minutes later we were seated. By the kitchen. I was trying my BEST NOT to look in the kitchen, because if I did, I'm sure I would have lost my appetite. Waiters and waitresses blatantly ignored us for about 15 minutes. I didn't feel special though, because they were ignoring other customers that were seated by us also. Finally the waiter who brought the water earlier took our order. I got the smothered chicken, cabbage and mac and cheese and friendgirl got the smothered pork chop, mashed potatoes and collards. Food was pretty decent. Nothing to write home about though. When I go back to Vegas in a couple months I won't return simply because I don't agree with the way they run their business. Doesn't matter to me if your food is amazing, if your service is poor, it's a NO for me.",

    "text": "This establishment has the worse customer service imaginable. When I came in, I told the hostess that I wanted to order to-go. I asked her how long would I have to wait. She said it depended on what I ordered, so I told her I only wanted shrimp & grits and a couple of side orders. She informed me that it wouldn't take long at all. After ordering, surprise surprise it took a whole hour before I got my food. When I received my food, I noticed they didn't give me any plastic spoons and forks. It took me forever to catch someone's attention. When I finally did, the waitress told me there was no more plastic cutlery. How the hell am I supposed to eat my food?? So I told her I needed at least a fork. She said she'd find me one. 20 minutes go by and I've tried getting multiple waitresses attention, but I was ignored by them all. Now I'm pissed, I came here early enough to grab some food before work and still be able to relax at home, but because it took so long I needed to rush straight to work. I start yelling because it's completely ridiculous for an establishment to treat any customer like they don't exist. All I needed was some cutlery. It was like magic, they all of a sudden found a box of plastic cutlery. So basically y'all were too lazy to go grab a box from the back. Never coming back  If all of this wasn't already bad, the food was TRASH!! I ordered shrimp & grits with a side order of Mac & cheese and Cornbread dressing. The shrink & grits needed salt, the Mac n cheese was alright, but the cornbread dressing was freaking SOUR! That means they gave me expired food, I'm done.",

This restaurant is off of the strip and seems subtle and quiet, but the taste are powerful!  The biscuits seemed to melt in your mouth. I had bacon, eggs and home fries for breakfast along with succulent biscuits. The bacon was crisp, the eggs were perfectly cooked and the home fries were flavorful. My companion had chicken and waffles. I must admit, I don't normally like the combination of chicken and waffles, but the chicken and waffles came with chicken wings and buttery waffles. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and very crisp. The combination  of sweet and salty were divine. This is definitely a place that I will return to when I return to Vegas. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, except for when it comes to great food !",

You hAve to sign your name on the notebook when you arrive. Overall, though the food seasoning and taste make up for it. The prices are reasonable. Good portion sizes. Small parking lot. I recommend taking uber to get here. Once you order the food came out quickly. And this was legit country soul food. There is full size and half size food orders. The full size comes with two pieces of meat and three sides. The half size comes with one piece of meat and two sides. Great portion for price paid. Overall i got three meals and spent $70. Including 2 fruit punches. I highly recommend the fried catfish. Mac cheese and collard greens with fruit punch.",

We got the wrong food which the owner corrected but after we left we noticed we were overcharged by $50. We got three dinners so didn't fret it until we looked at food that we never got. We called the restaurant and the owner said he would look into the receipt number never called back. After 2 weeks I went back to Vegas to talk to him about and of course he wasn't there. I was given a customer complaint number and was told it would go straight to his phone and he would reply. Never happened. I go back at night and of course he wasn't there but his wife had come and gone. This is a crooked businessman. His establishment is unsanitary too which is why his other location closed. He walks around with a pistol on his hip talking about he's from LA. Trying to overcompensate for something clearly but he's too chicken to even face a customer with a gripe. This guy is why Black businesses fail and don't get support from their own people. Whites at least get the concept to not piss off the customer. Not to bite the hands that feed them. I couldn't care less if I saw him or his ghetto ass employees ever again. I'm so pissed because I gave him the benefit of doubt and reaches out to his store 3-4 times and hit him up on Facebook messenger. If it weren't for prayer this guy would've had a problem on his hands. Las Vegas police don't deal with civil suits at all. He was relying on that. Don't forget criminals are smart. Owners name is Tim Gee",

First we get sat at a  corner table which was lop sided like some one had been leaning on it for the past 10 years . We get our sweet tea which was warm and almost no ice . We happened to get the one black lady server whose section only had one row of tables , us being her only customers only saw her twice the whole time lol. There was another white lady server who was busting her ass and giving out great service I wish I had her as my server as I would have gladly gave her a 50% tip. We ordered our food I got the car fish with Mac and cheese plus mash . I expected some wonderful flavors but was left with a bland taste and very dissatisfied. All the while the busser was loading up dishes in the main dining area with a cart and dropping ceramic plates loudly into the box. The waiter never checked on us as we were pretty much done. We got up waited at the front counter for good couple minutes and realized we can just walk out as our server was literally just chit chatting with another black girl this whole time . Of course I would never walk out paid my bill and left 0 tip . Screw this place",

With only 2 people working the front we were still taken care of, treated to fresh hot corn cakes and jokes were still made. They kept their tempo up even when a crowd poured in.  The food was in generous portions. Because of its reasonable pricing I thought the portions would be small.  I over ordered. The amount of food brought to me was daunting. Once I started I couldn't stop though. The sides alone were worth the visit and price. My main entree being especially good. (Snapper) Very filling, to both the stomach and the soul.

But when I have to wait over an hour to receive my food, something just doesn't make sense.   When the food did arrive I couldn't believe how bland and mostly tasteless it was. I've been here several times before and the food was always prepared like it was cooked by someone's big armed granny from down south. Today it tasted like it was bright out of a can and salt was added.   I was thinking it might have been just me but everyone at my table agreed that we should have just went somewhere else, especially after having to wait over a hour for something I can get from the local Golden Corral.",

We got our drinks right away and NO ONE CAME TO TAKE OUR FOOD ORDER.  The place wasn't crowded. Got there around 12:30 pm and while sitting and sitting and waiting and waiting.  Seen several waitresses walk by and not one of them even bothered to look at us to take our food order. The gentleman who got us our drinks walked by and said to us \"No one came yet?\"  And we told him \"No\".  Shortly a waitress did come by and said, \" I'll be right back to get your order.\"  Well she never came back and we got up and left.   Extremely POOR SERVICE!!!!!!! I hope the restaurant owner reads this review....",

They had so many good choices on the menu then it for down to the hard part, my order ! I wanted to order the meatloaf and they were out so that was sad after sitting there trying to decide from 2other choices on the menu lol I just hope I'm not disappointed with my decision. I can say the restaurant is clean and that M & M stands for Mississippi Mary Soul Food....so that southern style cooking is warm to the soul....finger licking good! Can't wait to dive in!.......UPDATE: OAN let me add how wen I got my food in under 10mins how was that literally possible. Also my macaroni was cold and the server which was just pretty much her...needed assistance on the floor with serving. This place wasn't what I expected it to be and I won't be eating here again when I visit back to Vegas!",

The fried chicken was DRY as hell... I thought I was eating a Brillo pad.  The Mac and cheese was without the CHEESE ...they should change the name to Macaroni and butter.  And the \"Dressing\" was simply bread crumbs and sage.  Absolutely horrible..... WHAT HAPPENED?????   Get it together M&M....",

Maybe we were the fools for still waiting.  It took an additional 30+ mins to get our food and once it arrived it was cold.    After speaking to the assistant manager who seems to know how to run the business.  She seemed to have just started the same day, fresh off the interview!  Speaking to her expecting for the service to get better was a waste of time.  Watching the manager duck in and out of the kitchen trying not to be seen by upset customers.  This restaurant will soon be closed just like the others pretty soon.     It's sad to say because I love to support black businesses.  I also wonder if they sold recently because they seem to all be new.   If you go here....   I hate to say it but I told you so!!!   Good luck!!",

I am always trying to support local places. So I tried this place a while ago - before I was active on Yelp. The service was horrendous. The food? Even worse. I spent about $50 on about 10 morsels of food between two people. My friend ordered fried chicken which was dry as sawdust. I ordered the short ribs which had about 5 bites to it. My stomach was still growling and the rest was globs of fat. Food was disappointing, cold, and some of it not even fresh. The beans, for example, were straight out of a can, water and all. Now I see this place has made its 4th appearance on Dirty Dining, and I just want to share my experience as fair warning to you all. Please don't even take my word for it - check Dirty Dining and the health report for yourself!",

I'd been there a number of times and have enjoyed their smothered chicken, pork chops and several other of their specialties but never the liver. They did not fail to please. The food was on point. Liver, yams, rice and gravy and greens. Although the gravy on the rice and liver was pretty minuscule to my liking.   But, you wonder why the average score? A few things. It's been a while but they used to offer cornbread with every meal; that's gone. Their location on Las Vegas blvd has heavy construction so parking is at a premium ( I went to this location after finding the Charleston location closed; no signs just closed). The service was extremely slow even for them AND the restaurant was not crowded; just wait staff choosing not to move very fast-maybe it was the heat.   Las Vegas prides itself on great customer service but don't expect it here-it's average at best. But if you can get past that, the food is well worth the trip. I wish I could give a more glowing review but that's the best I can do.",

We started off terrible because I have twin 2 year olds and they only had one high chair in the whole place.  I was meeting a group of ladies and told them just bring the one while I waited at the door.  After 5 minutes I asked again and another staff member informed me they just had one and I told them that was fine and that I was sitting with the group right by the door.  After another five minutes I decided to go to the bar and asked for someone to bring out the high chair which they again informed me of the one and they finally did.  After all that, the one chair was broken and so I had them take it back.  Then since I was joining the ladies already in progress I waited for a waitress.  After never getting one I went to the bar and ordered the food with the first person I could get, then when they brought it I had to go back to the bar and ask for a drink and silverware. After finishing I went back to the bar and asked for the bill.  We paid and left.  The one good thing is we were right at the door and right by the bar so getting someone was always easy and they always had a smile and responded.  The bad thing is I always had to initiate everything.  Unfortunately I'll never go back to this location but I have been to the other location with three babies and got excellent service with high chairs in excellent condition.",

Advise that in the beginning   to give people   an option  if they even   want  to   stay. I will   NEVER   come to this establishment  again.

I ordered the fried chicken, collard green and yams...everything was hot and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the smothered chicken, collard greens, yams and macaroni & cheese. His food was also hot and delicious, except for the macaroni & cheese...the waitress informed us after serving my food that the \"noodle truck\" was just arriving and that the mac & cheese would have to be swapped for another side item. My boyfriend chose the rice and beans instead, which was luke warm and bland. The table next to us was offered free drinks since they also had to swap out their side items...we were not offered the same deal. Overall the food was good and the service was good but hopefully in the future they will schedule their \"noodle truck\" to arrive before they begin serving lunch.",

    "text": "Some serious bullshit going on here!  The waitress didn't approach our table for 15 minutes after we were seated.  It was a lightskinned lady that was the rudest bitch Ive ever met.  We sent in our order for 3 kool aids... It never made it.  when she finally came back without our kool aid to take our order we had to remind her about it.  She didnt apologize.  She acted irritated that we asked again for our kool aid.  Bitch,  I cant even ASK for my kool aid?  Then she stomped off all mad to get it and came back then to take our order.  She wasnt even paying attention.  She took the order while looking around. Of course she got it wrong.  We all go the same thing apparently.  We ordered the little cornbread pancakes.  They are one of the main reasons for going, and we never got them.  We just kept asking for them everytime she walked by.  This bitch spilled gravy right onto my friends lap and didnt say sorry, didnt try to help with a wet rag, the bitch just put the plate down and took off.  We complained about every one getting mac and cheese when no ordered mac and cheese.  Then we asked again about the cornbread, she got an attitude and said there wasnt anymore.  When it came time to pay she had the nerve to say \"do you need change\".  I said yes i do.  Then when she put the money in my hand she hovered over the table waiting for that tip.  NO CLASS OR SERVICE.  THIS WAS BY FAR, IN MY 40 YEARS OF GOING TO RESTAURANTS THEEEE ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE IVE EVER EXPERIENCED.  THE SHITTIEST WAITRESS IVE EVER ENCOUNTERED.  SHE NEEDS TO GO INTO ESCORTING AND TREAT THEM TRICKS LIKE THAT.  SOME MEN ENJOY THAT.  WAITRESSING WAS NOT HER THING.  IT SUCKS BECAUSE SOME GOOD FOOD... BUT ITS NOT WORTH GETTING TREATED LIKE THAT.",

The staff was very friendly and they welcomed us very warmly just like souther hospitality is known for. We came during breakfast hours and I got the chicken fried steak that came with two biscuits and potatoes, ordered the grits on the side. It was AMAZING. The batter was crisp, meat was very juicy and tender. Potatoes were on point and seasoning was great! The biscuits were so fluffy and soft and oh so buttery. Even the grits were hot and very fresh. Best chicken fried steak I've ever had. He got the chicken and waffles and he got three good size wings very crispy and seasoned. Waffles were Long shaped and very good looking. It was little crisp on the outside and fluffy in the inside and it was perfect. Overall, the food was amazing, fresh, home made and authentic to their southern roots. The drinks came in cute mason jars. The presentation here is excellent. Also it is a huge restaurant. Service was over the top. She was fast, filled up our drinks often and she was so cute and nice! Will go back every time in we are back in Vegas!",

I must say that the young lady that served me was nice. Other than tha and the yams that was it. I was told that there is another cafe which is the original one and they are 5 times better.",

    "text": "There are two locations. The one on Charleston has better reviews. Maybe we will try that one the next time. Well let me start by saying .... The service from Llyana is why the food was given 3 stars. Llyana was a great server! She was attentive and polite! I think we tipped her ten dollars for a 30.00 meal. It's Mississippi home cooking. I guess because I'm from Texas it wasn't good to me. I don't know. Well the corn pancake patties they give you while you wait are actually good. And the kook aid was tasty. I ordered smothered chicken, greens,mac n cheese and rice and gravy. I hated the gravy. The Mac n cheese was dry. The greens were ok. My friend ordered a half order of pork chops, cabbage, red beans and rice and yams. Her pork chop was tiny. The red beans were dry. She didn't comment on the yams. But the cabbage was decent and sweet. I'd suggest trying it for the experience but I wasn't really pleased. My brother wanted me to bring him some chitterlings. They allowed me to sample them first. But I've had better. So I told him not to waste his 20.00.",

I placed a call in order for a half portion of Short Ribs with Mac n cheese and collard greens for sides. Let's start with the actual call which I had to place 5x's before I got an answer. Not the most professional people answering the phone. I get there and a young lady named Tonisha help me. She was very pleasant, however the rest of the staff were quite loud and ghetto. It seems that they were having their own little party, which is probably why I had to call so many times before getting an answer. After all they didn't look that busy when I walked in. Now let's get to the food. It looked like something you would get I a school cafeteria. It was 1 rib, the sides were skimpy and not good at all. I was actually upset that I live so far away and I had to eat it. I would've been more upset if I had waisted $16.73!! Would I eat here again? Probably not!",

However, after waiting for our food for 45 minutes (posted estimated wait time is 20 minutes) and after the TABLE NEXT TO US (who ordered AFTER is) receiving their food, we gave up and left. And, the place was not even half full. Despite waiting for the food (kitchen's fault), the servers were rude and horrible as well.

We patiently sat and waiting on our food, which by the way took an hour! If I was the owner I would hire someone to manage this establishment and at least help comfort the customers as they are waiting! Perhaps bring out waters and drinks with cornbread cakes or something to help the time go by! There was so much chaos in the kitchen and it is my opinion that the energy of the kitchen shifted to the waitress who were clearly frustrated and over worked! There needs to be a better process of serving the customers! They are not prepared to handle large groups! They should take care of there smaller parties first!! Hells Kitchen needs to come film here and help this establishment!! Good food! Really good food but the wait time is too long! You're food will be fresh unlike buffets, so I give credit in that department! The owner should sit and watch how his business is being run!!! He would learn a lot! If your wait is long, get water and you have to try the lemonade and ice tea mixed!!! I sat and wrote this review and watched a show! Great concept! Well decorated and centrally located! They have take out! The kitchen needs to get their act together and fast! The reviews will match up once the kitchen moves faster and the waitresses help make the customers feel better!! Confusion!! Confusion!! Great food though!!",

It's a place I would recommend for anyone looking for some Soul Food west of the Mississippi.   The cornbread pancakes are outstanding and come with every meal order.

    "text": "We were very excited to see a reasonably priced soul food restaurant within walking distance of our hotel and on the strip! Couldn't wait to get in and have some amazing food.  We waited for over 20 mins for a table. Sad part, there were empty tables that could of been used, but weren't. We were given menus to look at and told that by the time we get our table our food would be ready. Nope. Can't order unless you are at a table or doing take out.  Once seated, we still had to wait almost another 20 mins for food. The menu doesn't accurately describe half size. Menu says that half size mean 2 side orders instead of 3. We ordered a half plate of catfish. We got 1 piece of fish. The two sides... one that we chose was out, but we weren't told until they brought our food out. Disappointing considering how long we waited to eat and that was one of the main things we wanted.  The food is alright. Mac and cheese is VERY GOOD. The catfish was on point. Their cornbread looks like small pancakes, but is pretty good too. The seasoning was hit or miss. Some things were great and some, not so much. The kool-aid, yes they have kool-aid on their menu, was soooooooo good!  Our waitress was pretty cool. She worked her tail off. I think her name was Skylar. From the moment we walked in, until we left, she was on the go and always very friendly. I loved her energy.  If it weren't for the long wait for a table, with multiple tables open I would of given 4 stars. The food isn't 5 star, but close. If you choose to come here, don't be HUNGRY as you have no idea how long you will have to wait for a table. The taste is close to southern cooking, if they tweak the seasoning a little on a few items it will be out of this world amazing! I may come back in the future...",

Not only that but she had a cell phone to her ear from the time we were seated to the time we left, over an hour. Service was practically non existent.   Several times I had to get up and go to the counter for incidentals.  Getting a refill on coffee was like pulling teeth, we never did get a water refill.  I ate there twice while in Vegas.  The meatloaf dry with the consistency of a can of dog food.  For my Monday breakfast I ordered sausage and eggs, all bland.  To be fair, my friend really enjoyed his gumbo but completely turned off with the service.",

Finally we got our meals and I must admit the meal was good BUT the service needs improvement and the morning waitresses need to work on their getto acting attitudes because it's offensive to customers like me. Despite the lousy waitress with the snotty attitude I still tipped her because she smiled after I express my unhappiness.",

The waitresses were loud,unprofessionsl very rude,talk with atitude and not very attentive. My son asked for a refill of coke and she brought back an ice tea. The waitress slammed our checked on the table. If i could i wouldn't give it a 1 star. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

Wait time was about fourty minutes, had to keep reminding the Waitress about our position in line. Their was no placing of names on list so it was like waiting in a Barber shop. At least three in our party of nine wanted Ox tail, Only to be told ten minutes after ordering that M&M had run out. Asked for Short Ribs, Sorry not available. Sitting on the right side of restaurant resulted in our party being blasted by the SUN setting in the West. There was no shade except for the occasional high profile vehicle that passed by on West Charleston blocking the SUN. The place is NOISEY, do not expect a nice quiet place or folk speaking to each other in normal volume. Imagine being in a Prison chow hall if you will. The food was \"okay I suppose\". My Meatloaf was cold in fact the string beans were hotter. We received our food before we got utensils to eat with. Orders were mixed up and at the very end when the Bill was presented, lo and behold the Ox tail was on the Bill. I believe if I live to be 100, I would not want to eat at M&M ever again. Ghastly!",

The Mac and cheese is not worth ordering since there is little cheese in it. There greens and yams are great.

Please stop cooking can foods ( yams/greens) the soul food culture can definitely tell canned from frozen. I would have given a 5 star review but having no welcoming individual at the door, serving canned foods, and the restaurant attire needs a better look.

I knew I wasn't eating there at that point. We told the lady about our problem her response was \"ok what you want I got yal\" and that point I was done. I'm still waiting for the manager to call me back after my fiscal Friday night at the W. Charleston location. I'm done. You try to support black establishments but they just don't wanna do right.",

I immediately called the restaurant and told them I got the wrong food and the lady  told me to come back and she will rectify my situation. I came back and my food was hot and ready for me with a smile and a sincere apology. Also the manager immediately greeted me with an apology and a smile when he saw me come in. In my opinion that was the best customer service I have gotten in a long time and I really appreciate the prompt service that I received without any attitude. Way to go. Good job guys",

We sat at the counter Taschala asked if we were ordering to go, we said yes, she said ok, but NEVER came back. Mind tou we were sitting at the counter so she saw us but she never took our order. After sitting at the counter for 30 minutes another waitress came and took our order. As we looked around the patrons that were ahead if us were sitting and eating and we still were waiting on our to go order. We waited for a whole hour and 15minutes,  that included ordering our food and receiving it. This makes no sense. I have never been to am establishment that took this long to feed anyone, we thought bc we ordered to go the service would be faster, but nope fooled us.",

We were kind of in a rush so we decided to order take out instead of sitting down and eating.   The service- the customer service here Sucks big time. We walked in, there is no sign that says \"to go\" or \"take out\". Nobody working in the front to direct you where to go to order. And to top of off, we flagged down one of the servers (who just so happened to be a manager) and asked her if she could take our order for our take out. Her words to us were \"you have to wait until we take care of all of our tables and maybe someone can help you\". Keep in mind we had already been waiting patiently for 15 min. We were finally able to get one young lady to assist us with our order. We ordered the friend chicken meals, with sides of candied yams, and mac n cheese. We were then told that it takes an additional 20 minutes on all fried orders. About 35 minutes later the food finally arrived. If we would've known it would've been that slow we would've sat down and eaten.   We did notice that the kitchen employees were working very hard and get the food out quick. However the servers were not coming to get the food from the line in a timely manner. Therefor the chef had to yell a number do times for them to come get the customers food.   The food- Great. No complaints at all.   Overall, a really nice restaurant food wise, but the customer service is deplorable.",

I highly recommend this place if you like southern/soul cooking. Fried chicken is perfection. Greens were fantastic and hot sauce on the table. My kinda place.",

As we got there the wait time was long,(30 minutes) but we could not understand why, because there was so many open tables, we noticed three waitress working but no organization. We where finally got  seated waited another 15 minutes, had 2 keep asking is someone going 2 take our order? The we noticed another group that came in after we did was seated, & there order was being taken first. Buy the time the waitress that took the other guests order first came over to use, we was asking her questions about it. She instinctively got an attitude, we got up and left. Never ordered, I do not need 2 spend my money in an place that does not no how handle a guess.  If this business wants 2 stay in business, they need some serious help in management & staffing, Good luck if you still want 2 try this place",

This didn't happen to us, but there was clearly a party of similar size who have been waiting longer than us to get a table.  I mean, it sucks for them that they got seated after us, and I'm not complaining, but that's not cool.  It's also a complete waste of space.  At least, like 5-10-15 feet between tables.  There's no list by which you sign up and wait for a table.  It's just a woman who walks around like every 5-10 minutes and asks how long people have been waiting, totally inefficient.  Got seated, and waiting to order?  Like 10-15 minutes.  Waitress apologized, but she probably didn't care.  It sounded like she was used to apologizing and was just doing it out of habit.  Got water and drinks? About 5 minutes after we ordered...  Let's see when the food--  ya'know what? I'm as fired of writing as I'm tired of waiting.  I'm not gonna review the food.  It's probably whatever.  I'm done.  **I know there are typos in here.  Not worth fixing.  If they go out of business, fine.  Whatever.",

We walked in the door and there was no one there to greet us or take our name. A few people left so we sat down in the waiting area and some waitress walked over and asked how many in our party. She then sat us ahead of a few other parties. We then sat and waited...........   I had to find my own menus and the waitress looked at me crazy when I reached for one. Like excuse me this is a restaurant, I need a menu to know what you offer. Then we waited some more................   15 min later someone walked by and handed us silver wear   10 min after that the waitress came and said she would be right back........ Another 10 min and someone else said they would be right with us. Another 5 and we got cornbread pancakes with no butter (still no drinks). Another 10 min and we placed our drink order. Almost an hour goes by and we still haven't ordered our food.   There is a disclaimer on the menu that it's another 20 min wait for fried food (most of the food on the menu is fried)   10 min later we finally ordered food after I mentioned I was going to leave and go to IHOP (waitress overheard me)   It has now been over an hour and just ordered our food. The waitress felt bad so she brought us another cornbread pancake but at this point I just want my food. But since we ordered fried food it will probably be another 20-30 min for that.   Sigh I just wanted some soul food before we head home from an epic weekend and all we are getting so far is an epic fail of service.   Can't review the food since I haven't eaten yet.....",

Word of mouth hyped it up so guessed it was worth a shot, besides I'm always up for soul food.  Pros: The Fried Chicken was very well seasoned as well as the catfish. The mac & cheese was good. The service was friendly & very efficient with refills. Order the homemade lemonade! So good. The peach cobbler was AMAZING! (Wish they had served it warm) For the ice cream they topped it with a quality brand of vanilla bean.  Cons: The cabbage lacked seasoning of any kind, I did find a minced piece of some unknown meat it was too small to determine. The greens were bland, the red beans and rice, as well as the rice & gravy was mediocre but wish that the serving size had been larger to accommodate 3 large oxtails. Now the oxtails were very VERY good! From the meat perspective but the ratio of fat to meat was a losing battle, they were so fatty! (Picture to follow).  Overall Id return, But try out the other location (better reviews) and go about my order differently.",

The food here is good from the oxtails to the fried Okra, but I don't recommend coming here in the evening as service can be much slower than during breakfast or in the afternoon.  My family and I waited in the seating area for 15 minutes, and I didn't understand why such a long wait because there was empty seating in parts of the restaurant. After we were finally seated and placed our orders, we were given hot cakes, which were good and soft. A great combination! Our waiter was very friendly and welcoming, though she made a mistake on our orders, she was quick to rectify them and offered us complimentary sides with dessert. Sometimes things happen that are beyond our control and we can only move forward and control our own actions, and our waiter handled hers very well.   I would highly recommend this place. Just be sure to come earlier in the day for a more speedy service.",

Food finally arrives and smothered chops just okay,rice with gravy(about a teaspoon ) worth. Meatloaf extremely salty and not done. Mac and cheese out of the box. Best thing about the meal was red kook-aid and sweet tea. Credit is due to waitress with red hair,she was very nice, she apologized for the shortcomings but not enough for return visit.

The service was quick, friendly, & all wore cute appropriate uniforms.   My grandpa ordered the half fried catfish (9.99) w/ yams and collards.  He is 80 and doesn't eat much, but cleaned his plate today.  I got the half fried chicken (9.99) w/ fried okra and macaroni and cheese.  The fried chicken was some of the best that I have ever eaten - I grew up working in a fried chicken restaurant in south Georgia.  I will definitely eat here again.",

Now, I can get this southern style comfort food quite often if I choose to. I don't know how healthy it will be for me, but I will enjoy it!  I am a big fan of the catfish, and the fried chicken. The meatloaf didn't impress me, but the gravy on top was great.  The greens, the mac & cheese, and the rice and gravy are personal favorite sides. And if you like mustard, try the potato salad as it has a mustard-y flavor that is undeniable.   This location is pretty big. You could pull off a birthday dinner or special event easy. The service is great, very friendly and hospitable. They make me feel welcome every time.   Don't let the surrounding area throw you off. It is not the best neighborhood, but there are way worse areas in Vegas.  I am glad to see a local mom & pop shop expand. Especially to Las Vegas Blvd where they will hopefully get that tourist traffic. Thanks M&M, next stop, Henderson!",

I also had the rice and gravy which didnt have any taste but Hey it's rice. The cabbage was bland and soft.  My wifey had the fried pork chops which was actually pretty good but basic. The greens were extremely bitter to the taste.  Our service was mediocre. We advised her that we needed a refill on water before the Mason jar was empty. As I watched her gossip with another server for 5-10 mind I kindly gave my girl the rest of my water as I was already annoyed with my food.  She later came over dropped off water and check. Had this place been busy she might have gotten a tip but considering we was her only table...  That service wasnt acceptable. I wouldn't recommend this to my neighbors dog.",

I had smothered chicken, Mac and cheese, house dressing, and green beans. Needless to say, I didn't have to cook dinner thanks to the huge portions. Our server,Jay, was great, fast, and supplied extra napkins!!!! As we know many establishments are tight on the napkins! We went around 11:30 ish, lunchtime so we had about a 10 minute wait, not bad at all! I enjoy and support M&Ms and highly recommend!",

We shared an serving of fried okra.   Let me start by saying that was some of the best fried okra I have ever had. It was extremely tasty, and me and my mom made short work of it.  My mother enjoyed everything she ordered only stating that the sides of red beans and rice and the greens could have been hotter.  They were like lukewarm. Which brings me to my food. The chitterlings were delicious. I normally don't eat them, but I wanted something different. Nothing else caught my eye. The yams were very delicious as well, they seemed to be fresh to me and not canned. The cabbage on the other hand was warm, and bland. They didn't really have any flavor to me. I was extremely disappointed in that fact because I've been waiting some cabbage.    Anyways, I enjoyed my meal and I like the set up of the restaurant. Also, we had a great waitress who's name slips my mind. Great service.  I just wish the side dishes were a little hotter.",

The peach gobbler, canned peaches (which is not bad BUT it didn't have flavor e.i nutmeg, cinnamon, etc... and the crust was brunt!!   The waffle was good!!! But it is s long waffle not a Belgian style waffle. The sides rice and beans and cabbage were decent.   Price is reasonable and staff was friendly... though they forgot to put our waffle in the bag!

I specifically went up there myself and ask for a manager and looked at the manager in her face when I asked to speak to her  and she still never came over.

I'd like to start by saying that I'd heard so many wonderful reviews on M & M Soul Food Cafe and my expectations were quite high. I got to the restaurant with my family, 5 other individuals, at 3:30 PM and stood waiting to be greeting by a host. After several minutes of waiting, the host, who also happens to be the manager, came to greet us. She informed us that there was a wait of 25 minutes. After waiting for about 45 minutes, we approached the manager and asked for an update on the table. She informed us that we could not be seated because there was a shortage of fried chicken and there was another table who had not been served their food yet. Fast forward 1 hour. We are irritated that we still don't have food. The manager came over and started to have a friendly conversation in which we informed her that serval parties have left because of the long wait and bad service. Verbatim, she replied \"we don't care! Our food is good and we only want to serve customers who understand that it's going be a long wait\"   Fast forward another 25 mins.. still no food! The server came over and told us our food was \"up next\". My cousin asked what \"up next\" meant and then all hell broke loose. The server replied that she didn't know what it meant but that she saw our ticket up next at the counter. My cousin asked if the server could go and ask the manager how long \"up next\" was. The server replied \"no I already asked my manager 3 times and she just told me to get the hell out of her face\" Wow. My cousin said, you do realize we have been waiting for 2 hours and the server replied \"what do you want me to do about it\"   Fast forward 10 minutes, our food finally came! BUT our orders were wrong, the food was cold, and the vibe and experience was ruined.",

My husband ordered pancakes he sent the first set back because they were over cooked and hard on the bottom like they tried to hide it. I wouldn't order pancakes here ever. He said his shrimp and grits were ok nothing special. Over all it was really disappointing. Our waitress was the best thing they had going for this place she was charming happy and attentive.

    "text": "Wish I could give zero stars. Don't waste your time. Honestly some of the most disgusting food I have ever had, much less paid for. If you are in Vegas for a limited amount of time, you want to have great meals and not waste money and TIME on disgusting overpriced food.  Decor: hole in wall with tables. But I am here to eat, so I can overlook that Service: pathetically slow. Took 1 hr to get our food.  FOOD: We ordered chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, wings, mac n chz and a side of corn cakes. Trying to understand how it took 1hr to come out,  at 11am, when the restaurant was half full? The wings were so dry and over cooked. Had no flavor. No lawrys, no black pepper, no garlic, nothing, just dry. How do u mess up wings that bad, that they can't even be eaten? My hubby will eat almost any wing. The waffle had no flavor. But what was the worst about the waffle was that they served it with Country Crock vegetable spread! (Those lil packets)Not butter! GTFOH. Then the syrup was room temp, not warmed, and it came from a big plastic container. The mac and chz, was not hot and had zero taste.  I think Kraft macaroni would have been better. Yuck. Shrimp n grits were ok.  Corn cakes were good, too bad I didn't have real butter for them! For this luxury it cost me $48. I should have just went to one of the other proven soul food spots on the strip. I would have spent the same money, but would have had better food.",

Mac and cheese: Subpar..cold and not seasoned Greens: Nothing Special about them and also cold Corn bread dressing: Decent but needed more gravy and also cold  Catfish: The only reason for the star. It was the only good thing on the plate.  Portions are small, food is waaayyyy over priced for the small portions they give, definitely won't be going back and it's sad because I want to support black businesses as much as I can.

Second a manager should know how to do everything in their restaurant that the employees are responsible for. We were served after other customers that were seated after us, only to wait for our food for over 35 minutes after other guests in our party were served. The food quality was sub par. Most of our food was served 15 min apart from each other. When we brought our concerns to the manager he was not concerned about customer satisfaction but more with trying to convince the customer that you will not be accommodated for the inconvenience. This was one of the most inconvenient, unprofessional experiences I have endured in a long time. I will not be returning.",

I than took a menu of the host stand and sat at the bar. I reviewed the menu and sat there for another 15 minutes before I was able to wave a waitress down. I ordered the fry chicken and ask for a side of mash potatoes but they were all sold out of it and the collard greens so I picked random side dishes. I also ordered a koolaid with my food. She than tells me to sit at a table because the bar is only for togo orders. I than sat at a table and waited another 15 min and still didn't get my drink. I was so pissed I got up and walked out. The food looks and smells amazing but the staff dont care about the guests. If you have alot of time on your hand lsd than give it a shot but I sure wont be coming back here.",

Seemed like only a couple of waitress on duty, I think our waitress was Atifa, sorry if I got you're name wrong if not correct. She was great, she had to take care of most of the tables, cash out the customers and make sure everyone's order was correct and see if they needed anything else.  I had fried chicken and rice and gravy and rice and gravy. My wife had fried catfish rice and gravy and red beans and rice. The food took awhile but understand that the fried chicken takes awhile to cook. Both orders came out at the same time and we're nice and hot and oh, so good. Chicken was nice and crispy and moist and piping hot. My wife loved her catfish, this is the first time here at this location, we used to go to the location on W. Charleston when we lived in Las Vegas. Different location same great food and service. Keep up the great work here.",

Once we were seated i noticed the waitresses were running all over the restaurant with  no clear direction of what was happening.   I ordered the muddy water and the full order fried chicken (3pc of 2 legs on thigh) with Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy  with collard greens. My boyfriend got the half ribs with Mac and cheese with mashed potatoes and gravy.   The chicken was fried good but lacked flavor along with the mashed potatoes that tasted like they didn't season it at all, the Mac was pretty dry, the greens were ok and ribs were half fat half meat.   Our waitress was a mess. Kept asking what we ordered, forgot my boyfriend's water and took forever with my card... boyfriend went to the bathroom and some before I got my card back.  I would not recommend or return here.",

Then we moved to AZ.  When I found out that there was an M&M's in Las Vegas, there was no way I was going to pass it up and boy I am so glad I didn't.  The wait was about 20 to 30 minutes, it was definitely worth it.  I ordered the fried chicken, greens, dressing, and candied yams.  The chicken was fried perfectly and seasoned.  The greens were on point.  The dressing!  OMG, tastes exactly how I remembered it. And the yams!  Another side that hasn't changed a bit.  So tender and sweet and cooked to perfection.  My hubby wanted the oxtails, but they were out so he ended up ordering the fried chicken, yams, mac and cheese, and greens.  The only thing he didn't like was the mac.  It wasn't a good batch.  Our server was amazing and the food on point!  Definitely going there every time we go to Vegas.",

    "text": "Well.. if you have watched the latest episodes of Sweetie Pie, and wondered what could have gone more wrong for Tim and Co. at his Houston venture, look no further, cause M&M is it.   All you need is light and camera, and Gordon Ramsay himself, and this one can easily go down in one of the \"Kitchen Nightmare\" episode.  Or give Robert Irvine a call, and this will do quite well for \"Restaurant Impossible\".   Sarcasm aside, let me get in the experience my wife and myself just endured today.    After waking up early in Vegas (around 1230), my wife decided to check out M&M Soul Food Cafe since her friends from Seattle (Red Flag #1) told her this was a great joint for soul food.  We caught a Uber and arrived in the not so crowded restaurant, about 7 waiting (including us) and a dozen or so dining in.  So I thought to myself we shouldn't wait anytime with our dining experience.   A sign near the host stand caught my eyes while we were waiting, indicating all fried food will take 25~40 min (Red Flag #2).  I have been in the industry for 20+ years, managing restaurant big and small, never have I seen a sign like this before. But when in Rome...  Ambiance (2 out of 5)  Typical diner set up.  This one doesn't bother me as much since most soul food place is defined by their food rather attractions.   Speed of Service (1 out of 5)  I have to separate quality and speed here because the staff were actually friendly (forgetful, but friendly).  But the speed..  After the waitress, singular as we didn't see another one for another 1 and 1/2 hr later, took our drink and food order, it took another 30 minutes for the \"cornbread\" to arrive.  We then waited nearly 45 min, and watched 2 tables worth of customer (who sat after us) leaving, we got our food.  Despite telling the waitress to have my fried food for take out, so my wife and I can enjoy the non-fried food first, everything came at once.    Quality of Food (1 to 2 out of 5)  I ordered a good sampling of the food, because I wanted to be fair to my judgment.   Cornbread - I know these are actually mini pancake with corn bread mix, but they tasted delicious especially when you top them with some tabasco.  4/5.  Collard Green - I hate stems in my greens.  Stems checked.  I hate watery greens because they lessen the flavor.  Watery green checked. 1/5  Corns - This must be either canned or frozen, with little process.  I would've settled if they just simmer some frozen corn in butter.  But corn kernels simmered in hot water? No thanks. 1/5  Beef Short Rib - I had to settle for this since the waitress told me their Ox tail would take 1 hr to make (Red Flat #3).  The flavor would have been great if they didn't doused with BBQ sauce.  I think the rib was slow cooked with the greens.  Not a bad idea.  3/5   Chitlins - This dish was actually pretty good.  I know some of your food critiques would complain about the smell and question whether they were treated properly.  But I grew up in a farm in China, so I am okay if my plate of chitlins smell a bit on the raw side.  It's tender and completely broken down, a bit more spice would be nice, but this is nice. 4/5  Fried Fish - 4 oz of cat fish fillets don't take 1 hr to make.  It doesn't matter if this is Chinese math or Deep south math.  There is nothing write home about these.. no bones? 2/5  Fried Chicken - Though I disagreed with my wife that her chicken was better than the restaurant we went to yesterday, I assured her that hers were better today.  But I was so hangry, I finished mine anyway.  Kind of wished I saved the $$$ for some KFC or Popeye when I get home. 1/5  Seafood Gumbo - Gumbo should not be snoddy (Red Flag #4).  Put some acid (tomato will do), and it will break down the chemical chains which make snoddy gumbo.  My wife had a horrible experience with it and I couldn't say much about it either.  Just because you have all the ingredients of a gumbo in a dish, does not make it a seafood gumbo 1/5.   Price (1/5)  Just because you are near the strip, does not mean you can charge it.  Especially with the slow service, unattentative table touches, and sub par food.  The menu price does not justify the food, in a bad way.   Overall (1/5)  I heard there is another M&M on Charleston Blvd, and the food there is better.  But I only had the experience at the one north of the strip.  I must regrettably say my experience was not a fond one.  If the ownership or manager thought I was overtly harsh or critical, I am more than willing to offer more insightful suggestions regarding operation or improvement.   Bests,",

    "text": "Food is horrible.  This review is from my visit October 28, 2018. Friend from town wanted soul food, we went to M&M's on Charelston, they were closed for remodeling (although I don't think they will open again), I did not want to go to the downtown location as I have heard bad things about this location. But I said lets give it a try. First off its in the same parking lot as a wedding chapel, along with an old Motel that is fenced off for remodeling. So there are very few parking spaces. When we went in we were 3rd in line and the 2 waitresses seemed to be rushing around leaving the line unattended with no acknowledgement that we were there. After standing there about 10 minutes we were seated. I noticed right away the prices were higher than the other location, but okay it's the strip and my friend wanted to go.  I ordered fried chicken, macaroni & cheese, and collard greens.  I knew something was wrong when the food came out in 5 minutes, I was prepared to wait for fresh fried chicken...its soul food remember. They brought some yams to us that we did not order, the waitress said take them anyway so we did. The chicken was cold, the macaroni & cheese was cold and sour tasting, the greens were also cold and had a stale or not fresh taste to them, the yams she mistakenly brought looked like baby food and were way to sweet. We told our server were not paying for this food and she simply said ok. She didn't ask what was wrong, no manager came out, there was no negotiating. We simply got up and walked out.  This told me they are used to this and they know this food is garbage.  I will never, ever go there again and I would not recommend anyone go there. You would do better going to Popeyes.   M & M's originated from LA (southern CA), there is also a location in Pasadena which is good to, I used to frequent both;  so when I moved to Vegas I was excited to know there was one here.  The one on Charelston is not like LA, but it's good enough but the Las Vegas Blvd needs to be shut down.  They have certainly tarnished the brand.",

I most likely will NOT be coming back to this location in Vegas for soul food.",

Everyone who was waiting for a table were seated before we even got a order. I paid $20 for a fish plate and only for two pieces of fish... never again! Overpriced and bad service. Fish was over cooked and not hot. Only thing good was the cornbread and okra.",

    "text": "As a native of Louisiana who has also lived in Mississippi, I love me some good soul food.   After several trips, I can safely say that M&M's food is legit and authentic; but I have reserved judgment in giving a rating in hopes that they could improve their service quality. Unfortunately, after last night's experience, I was convinced that it is not going to get any better any time soon.   I arrived about 7 pm and the restaurant was not very busy with approximately 10 customers. I sat at the bar prepared to place a take-out order and **20** minutes later, the waitress finally took my order (fried pork chops, collard greens, mac & cheese, black-eyed peas). During that time, she asked the women sitting **next** to me three times what their order was (they were being very indecisive).   **45** minutes after that, I finally received my order. In the meantime, I experienced the following:  -2 take out orders fulfilled.  -The women next to me being hit on by the cook. And the cook giving them a free side order to try to win their favor. -The waitress helping the women next to me as they didn't like their food and getting them replacements. -The waitress asking me two additional times what my side items were -The waitress not acknowledging me in any other way (e.g., I'm sorry about the wait, would you like some water, etc.) during that time. -Did not receive the complimentary cornbread appetizer that is custom and other tables received. -The kitchen running out of the side items I ordered. -Lukewarm food when it finally arrived. -No \"thank you\" or \"sorry\" when the bill came.   I sat there patiently for this entire time. Maybe I should have spoken up but I didn't want to be disrespectful so perhaps that's on me.  And since I'm from the south, I get that we have a different pace of life there but service here has consistently been mediocre to poor with poor being more prevalent as of recent as I experienced last night.   I just can't ever see myself going to the restaurant again for the forseeable future.",

I would highly recommended. Didn't think to take a picture until after my food was all gone. Only minor complaint was if you order fried food, it takes about 25 mins to receive your food.

I grew up eating real southern soul food in Florida.  THIS is not real soul food.  It's over-priced wanna-be without any flavor.  There were LOTS of stems in the collard greens.  The \"meatloaf\" was nothing more than a salsbury steak, and a very small portion at that.  Also, the meat was raw in the center.  Undercooked ground beef is a recipe for food poisoning!  The fried pork chop was thin, mostly bone and fat, and flavorless.  The black-eyed peas were so over cooked they were mush and had a burnt taste to them.  Their \"world famous\" corn cakes were rubbery and flavorless.  They only good thing really were the mashed potatoes that had decent flavor and lumps (yes I love lumps in my mashed potatoes).    The music was so loud it was impossible to carry on a conversation without yelling.  We went for dinner, so the sun was starting to set and was blazing down onto the tables making it hot and stuffy inside.  The staff never offered to change the blinds to block the sun even with us squinting and fanning ourselves while trying to block the sun with our hands.  Between the heat, the sun, and the sheer volume of noise from the music, I left with a pounding headache.    The floors in the dining room were dirty.  The ladies room was FILTHY!  The trash cans were overflowing onto the floor.  While we may try the location on Charleston, we will not ever return to the location on Las Vegas Blvd.  Way over priced for the quality and quantity they serve.",

    "text": "To jump straight to the point, it's okay. Three people were in my oarty and we ordered the full order of fried chicken, full order of catfish and half order of bbq chicken.   I can (and will) only speak for the taste of the fried chicken. The fried chicken was well seasoned...but the meat itself seemed kind of dry. I had also ordered greens, mac & cheese & mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were alright, nothing extraordinary. Mac & cheese wasn't as cheesy as I prefer, but again..alright. The greens... I can cook greens so I'm pretty particular. I prefer mine spicy, these greens were not. They were quite smokey tasting. Some people prefer that.   The pros about this joint is that there is a lot of space, the mason jar kool aid (drinks in general) are a nice touch and the hot water cornbread served with the meals was great!   There is room for improvement in the service. The person acting as hostess that day (she was also serving, wish we had gotten sat in her section) was sweet and attentive. Our server stopped by to take our order and drop off our food and check. Our server never checked on us or our drinks... how our food tasted. I was thinking that maybe she was having a bad day, but I've served... leave your home problems at home.  There is also room for improvement on the flavor and quality of some of the food... but that may vary by person. Those who did not grow up eating and/or cooking soul food may not know, ha, but it can be executed much better.   Speaking about everything outside of the hostess... it just seemed like everyone didn't really care today. Perhaps just one of those days? I'm antsy to try the other location... I'm used to seeing a soul food joint on every other corner. I don't always feel like cooking, ha!  Don't come to Vegas for soul food... if you are really craving it, try this location if you want to - but don't expect anything to blow your mind.",

Service: Very friendly.  The people were great and welcoming. Decor: Kind of like a very big diner.  I sat at the bar and saw all the magic happen. Food: I don't have deep south food often (as it isn't the healthiest), but they had some great selections such as oxtail, chicken, chiclets, etc and serve it in 1/2 sized entrees (2 sides) or full size (3 sides).  I got the 1/2 oxtail and it was delicious.  I have to admit there was quite a bit of fat on it, but it also had quite a bit of meat on it. In addition, they give you free cornbread which is great to dip in any of the gravy.  Overall, try this place out for some deep south cooking if you are in Vegas.",

    "text": "Came here about 2 PM EST coming off my flight to Vegas before my hotel check-in. Was hungry and figured I get something to eat since I just arrived in town. Came in and sat at the counters area you see as you enter. The place had enough customers to be busy and by the way, everyone was moving around you'd think it was much busier. Was disappointed by the wait. Yep, they were busy, but it took longer than need be for someone to ask what I wanted and take my order. Thankfully ANGIE was great! Despite having her hands full, she took the time to check on me, take my order and give me some cornbread to start. I watched as all the servers hustled, the chef's coordinated things with them and one dude who acted like a manager but looked like he was a customer walked the kitchen area. About that: Bad Idea to have a wide open kitchen/serving area. Despite having a low wall to block the direct view of the kitchen, I could still see how everything operated in the kitchen. Back Of House....Keep that view away from the customers. It was no doubt part of the reason why a guy who came in ten minutes after I did leave when no one waited on him.  With all that, my food finally came and you know what? It was delicious! The battery on my phone drained otherwise I'd have taken a picture of my order of short ribs, red beans and rice, greens and fried okra. The beef was tender and leaving me wanting more. The greens? Well, I can eat just about any greens, but these were a bit dry but still great. The Red Beans and Rice were not New Orleans but still good and the fried okra wasn't how I usually have them, but that may change because I liked how they were done. I left full and happy except for that wait time and the architectural blunder of seeing the behind the scenes activity of the staff. The manager-looking guy should also consider dressing as professionally as his servers and chefs. But Angie was fantastic and the food was great. It's A-OK with me but I'd reconsider when I'd come in. I also chatted up a cutie customer who was coming for take out who told me of another location. I'd be curious to see how they operate. But, want a soul food fix in Vegas and willing to deal with these drawbacks? Then, by all means, check this place out!",

She had to bring me more.  ;-)  12:19 lunch served.    Sides great.  Chicken flavor is great. First piece of chicken is slightly overcooked but I pull most of the skin off anyway. Second piece is on target.  Could be the way they like to eat/prepare it.  Waitress forgot my Dr. Pepper but I didn't bring it up.  Two more tables had come in and I really didn't need it.  I'd come back.  May try other location to compare.  My soda is on the bill.  Evidently the bill wasn't checked.  Happily changed the bill.",

But sometimes the service is so bad that it makes me consider never going again and it's a 5 min walk from my condo.   My favorite menu item is the pork chops. They're ALWAYS good.  The fried chicken is great too.   My least favorite menu item is the shrimp and grits which tastes good but has terrible presentation. It just looks like soup on top of grits. In fairness to the restaurant I had it when they first added it to the menu but I haven't had it since because it just looked so gross.   The other thing that I don't like is the noise level. The building has awful acoustics so no matter what's going on it sounds super loud. Even when there's no music.   Overall I still rate it as a 4 because the food is almost always good and no matter how badly some of the servers treat me I just can't seem to quit them!",

From a business point of view its a shame the owner or manager does not take notice of the reviews regarding the service and get organized...whatever $$ they are makin could easily be double or triple of what they are currently bring in. We came in and put our name down on the waiting list and waited while the waitress would ask who was nxt instead of going from the list of names...from there once we were seated we now waited over an hour for our food....in tht time we saw the waitress hosting and seating customers....busing tables and serving food....it was total chaos...once our food came it was medium warm but pretty good.... coming from Los Angeles where the food scene if jumping this type of service wld not survive with all the competition.....tht being sd as a business owner help your community...hire some locals to bus and host and let ur servers do what they need to do to tend to your customers...get it together and i'm sure you will reap the benefits",

Our table of 4 got our food in increments...not all at once. My meal was brought out with vegetables first and the pork chops 5 minutes later. For better service they need to learn how to coordinate the meals so that everyone in our 4 person group gets their food at the same time...not 10 minutes apart.",
