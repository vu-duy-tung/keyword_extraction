We had our 2-year-old with us, and we shared with her (and \"bought her\" the Tom - Nutella, Banana, and whipped cream to share).  Great atmosphere, lovely owner, and worth repeating.

    "text": "I studied and lived in France for a short while, and like another Yelper said \"Anyone who is French, or has been to France has a place in their heart for crepes\". This couldn't be a Truer statement. So many times, I've given American \"creperies\" a chance to fill the void, and each time I've been sadly disappointed. All the whipped cream piled high makes no difference, to me. When I read the description of La Maison de Maggie on Yelp and saw that Maggie imports her flour from France to make her delicious crepes, I immediately knew that I had to try this place, because anyone that's ever tasted a French crepe knows that the difference is in the flour, NOT the toppings (as many crepe restaurants here in Vegas seem to think).   La Maison de Maggie is the real deal. I walked in on a, thankfully, very quiet afternoon. I didn't feel like dealing with a crowd, but I was desperate for a delicious crepe. Maggie was behind the counter making a crepe for a woman on the other side of the bar. I walked in quietly and gazed at the menu board, although I'd already planned out in advance (through Yelp photos and French experience) what I was going to order.  Maggie greeted me with a smile. She looked very welcoming and kind, with hard work in her face. When she was done making the woman her crepe, she came over to ask me what I would like. I asked for the Alex, for nostalgia's sake, and sat down at the bar and told her I would be enjoying it there in the restaurant. I noticed earlier that Maggie was speaking to the other woman, who had already left by then, in French. I decided to whip out some of my French and we had a great conversation about her time here in Vegas and the hardships of opening her own business here in Las Vegas. She is a hard-working woman who makes the most delectable TRUE FRENCH CREPE I've ever had away from the Homeland. She works by herself during the week and has a little help during the weekends. This business is ALL her.  The Alex has pears, caramel, cinnamon and powdered sugar. It was the perfect amount of sweet that I was craving. The crepe was thin (exactly the way it should be) and had the lightly spongey texture that I've missed so much in the 3 years since I was last in France. The pears weren't soggy inside the warm crepe; you could still feel a tiny crunch in the middle of the slices. The Alex reminded me of a crepe I had when I was young and in love in Paris. What a time in my life!   I'm telling you, the difference is in the flour. If you have any semblance of an idea of what a crepe tastes like, but have never been to France. Scratch it. You know nothing. I mean that in the most \"you have got to try this place\" way. Trust me. Maggie named all of the menu items after her friends and family in France. Everything feels that it was created with love and affection. She tries to steer clear of Yelp, because she is wary of negative comments. She simply enjoys what she does and wants to happily serve the delicious crepes that she creates. I encourage everyone to give it a try. The next time I go, I'll take photos and order a thing or two. My first priority, this time, was to get a foot in the door and try it out. I know I'll love everything on the menu, so now I have a ton of excuses to go back!",

I know they were probably annoyed but the lady was nice enough and told us it was okay if we dined in and enjoyed our crepes.  I ordered the FLYER crepe And I added spinach and an egg to it. It was loaded and filling! The crepe batter itself was very plain and thin. It was just okay. I think I enjoyed the side salad (w/ their HM honey mustard dressing) that came along with it better than the actual crepe.  My boyfriend ordered the Ham, egg and cheese crepe. The crepe was over cooked and the crepe batter was cracking. Not the typical French crepe I was expecting.  I also ordered a hazelnut latte to go along with my meal, and also.... Nothing special. It wasn't sweetened and I had to add my own sugar. :/ I was quite disappointed.... Since this is suppose to be an authentic French creperie. But I will give it another try! Maybe next time I will try their sweet crepes instead! :)))",

My girlfriend had a smoothie (Micka) and salad as well and they were also very delicious. She said she would've paid for a bowl of the mushrooms in her salad alone. Eat here as soon as you can if you haven't tried it yet.",

(maybe it is different in france but.. i always knew the crepe suzette to be lemon and powered sugar?) we couldn't even eat it. the other dish was the savory crepe with egg white, turkey, and spinach. the concept was there (sounds delicious right?) but execution was far below par. it was basically a millimeter layer of turkey, egg, and spinach with no sauce wrapped in a burnt buckwheat crepe. we ate it nonetheless because we were starved and just paid 30 dollars for a meal we anticipated to be JUST SO GOOD...",

This is a place you go to because you're looking for it, not because you passed a sign that says \"French Crepes\".  And you should go looking for it.  Their crepes are great, and very authentic, not only because they use different flour for the galettes (savory crepes) and dessert crepes, but because it's organic, and actually imported from France.  The crepes (the pancake part) have a delicate flavor, with a nice bit of sponginess.  The fillings are fresh and flavorful.  There is also a nice selection of fresh-made fruit and vegetable juices.  Their coffee drinks are also great.  The accent is on fresh fare that leaves you satisfied, but not overstuffed. Decorations are pleasant, without being overwhelming, and Maggie is warm and friendly.  The fact that French natives love to eat here tells you a lot about the quality and authenticity of the offerings at La Maison de Maggie.",

Offering up crepes and galettes, I've visited twice in an attempt to widen my French food horizons.  Upon entering the cafe on my most recent visit, the sweet smell of strawberry basil jam being cooked on the stove greeted my gal pal and I.  Chef Maggie was making a new batch to sell and I'm sure it went quickly.  I had my first galette, the July special, with mozzarella, tomato, goat cheese, and honey.  You can sit at the counter and watch your food being made in front of you.  Using authentic buckwheat and wheat flour imported from France for her crepes and galettes, Chef whipped up our orders in no time.   My galette was delicious, especially with the pairing of the cheese with the honey.  Chef Maggie also let us sample the freshly made strawberry basil jam: ooh la la!  This is food made with love from a real French chef.  Stop by to try something new for your palate:  bon appetit!",

Definitely thinner, healthier and prettier than those Americanized creamy fat crepes that many other restaurants serve. The owner takes care of this place really well.  We chatted with her a bit when she came to check on us, and she told us her that friends always said to her how come she kept cleaning and wiping the place all the time.  Tables, the way they put all the chairs, and of course both bathrooms, everything was kept organized and clean.  Although this place isn't that big, their layout is spacious for all customers and the high ceiling is adding extra to the comfortable feeling. We are certainly coming back during our stay in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Who doesn't so crazy for crepes? This is the perfect crepe brunch spot and you are going to be instantly charmed by the cute little details of the place, including the decorative naming of the crepes and the specialities written out on the chalkboard. The various compositions of different crepes on the menu all sound pretty great that I had trouble choosing what I wanted first, but eventually I opted for the Marion crepe (tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and pesto) and one sweet crepe, the Domi. They were both delicious, sweet, satisfying! The crepes can take just a little while to make, but they are well worth it. Ingredients are simple and fresh. Usually, there are no more than three or four ingredients per crepe. Everything was seasoned lightly and allowed for the natural flavors of the ingredients to come out.  I would have liked perhaps a more traditional French dressing on my salad otherwise everything was very good. The smoothies are to die for and I would highly recommend the Domi crepe, which had the perfect amount of salted caramel (not too sweet) and chopped nuts with vanilla ice-cream.  As the Editor-in-chief of French Quarter Magazine, I looked for a good French cafe in Las Vegas where I could take my guests and Maggie, the owner, welcomed us as we entered her restaurant. She shows her love for her heritage by the South of France inspired decoration, to her quotes written in French on the walls, the clocks on the wall showing the time difference between the U.S. and France, and of course crepes! When you get here, you get exactly what you look for: minimalistic design, simple ingredients, and great service. For a moment, I almost felt like I was back in France with the talk radio playing in the background.   I was really tempted to get a third crepe, but I'll have to wait another day. Viva les crepes!",

The owner and her employee were nice and tried their best to accommodate the large crowd, but service suffered. We were there forever. Not sure why only 2 people were working on Mother's Day.  Main cons: The coffee was really poor and the girl looked confused when we asked for sweetener. I basically spent 4 bucks on a latte I didn't drink. Also she said she had almond milk but told me when she brought my drink that they didn't have any left. She made it instead with coconut milk without asking me. Whatever.  Next, to be blunt..... The food just wasn't good. I was surprised since the owner is French and seemed to have some other decent reviews. I had the Sophie, my husband had the crepe of the month and my son ordered a sweet crepe with Nutella.  My crepe was a buckwheat batter and dry. I knew it was going to be buckwheat but expected a soft fluffy texture with cheesy oozing toppings. The cheese was not melted and the veggies lacked flavor.  My husbands pears were not mascerated in anything and they had no flavor so the Gorgonzola was very unbalanced. All salt no sweet.  My son had a sweet crepe -hard to go wrong with Nutella, but it wasn't as good as expected either.  Aside from the food, the sweet young girl employee was wearing thongs,as in flip Flops. Just not appropriate in a kitchen/cafe. Cheapens the place.  Sooo, not sure what to think. Hard when people have a nice concept, but no knowledge of the restaurant or hospitality industry to run a business.  Would've been less stars if they weren't friendly. Sorry ladies, we tried.",

We had the France and Sophie galettes and they were fabulous- the staff were very sweet and helpful and let us try some of their homemade jams (the peach mint and the persimmon were amazing).

The buckwheat gallettes are very tasty- we've had some of the specials and the regular ones. Ingredients are fresh and the combinations are interesting and creative. Each gallette comes with a green salad with mustard vinaigrette and is a nice foil. The sweet dessert crepes are yummy as well. Our son had a smoothie and it was a good. I love the authentic latte (or cafe creme) so it's what I always get. Maggie is a sweetheart which is a bonus. A++ will go back often.",

Everywhere I go people make them either too thick, too thin, too crisp or too soft. Here, she makes perfect crepes. The texture is perfect, the size is just right, and the ingredients are scrumptious and mouth watering. Whether you choose a sweet or savory crepe, you will not be disappointed. I had a breakfast crepe which kept my taste buds happy for the rest of the day. It was awesome! I will be coming back again and again as this is now my new favorite crepe place.",

La Maison de Maggie serves up quick and delicious, savory galettes (made with buckwheat flour) and sweet wheat crepes.

They also offer smoothies but i opted to save that for another time. The decor is reminiscent of a scene from a movie; a tasteful French touch with soft hues and romantic lighting.   I tried the France galette; a classic ham, mozzarella and egg combination, and for dessert, I had the Loulou; a wonderfully sweet vanilla chestnut jam, topped with fresh homemade vanilla whip cream. Seriously, one of the best I've had yet.",

I wanted to be healthy so I went with the Nancy, which came with egg whites, turkey, and spinach. I've never had a galette before so I didn't really know what to expect. I also ordered a latte.  I sat at the bar since all the tables were huge & preferably for bigger parties. The owner didn't think I was 21 so she asked me if I was since they can't have anybody underage at the bar (even though they didn't have any alcohol out). The latte came out first & it was good! It didn't have any sweetener added to it, which is how I like my coffee. The galette came soon after and I enjoyed it very much. I probably should have added a little bit of cheese or something.   The owner came and talked to me while I was eating. She asked how I found out about the place & also shared her thoughts about Yelp. Shes a very sweet and honest business owner. I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu, especially the crepes!",

    "text": "Now this is the sort of Parisian experience I'm excited to repeat. I'm very fond of galettes from my experience with a French bistro in Denver and Maggie's have to be the best in Las Vegas. Her galette batter is made with buckwheat flour from France, which is naturally gluten free. She also imports French wheat flour for her crepe batter- glutenous and delicious. Galettes make a perfect savory meal and crepes are great for a sweet snack. Most local places use crepe batter for both sweet and savory applications and that doesn't taste right. In my opinion, caramel is for crepes and pesto is for galettes.  I read over the menu behind the counter and decided to try the Flying Baby galette because it includes blue cheese. Asking Maggie why it is called Flying Baby, she explained that she named her menu items after family members and related a story of her godson in France bouncing around the house with so much energy, earning the nickname Flying Baby.  I took a seat at the bar and watched as Maggie prepared my galette. A few minutes later, my order was ready and she presented my plate. The galette was filled with a lot of melted cheese (mozzarella and Gorgonzola) and warm tomato slices. I love to combine bites of galette with the side of crisp lettuce topped with a perfect French whole grain mustard dressing. It was almost too much food, but I finished my plate and left full.  I'll be back with my daughter to try the crepes and smoothies. I just hope she is not able to reach the shelf of Kinder Surprise eggs, because she is addicted to opening those things. She will come in with a basket and hunt until she finds all the eggs. We'll call her Flying Baby II.",

    "text": "\"I will not let anyone walk through my mind with their dirty feet.\" - Gandhi  Crispy savory crepes for the win!   My love and I recently came to La Maison de Maggie with one of our favorite yoga/Yelp friends and I completely enjoyed the experience. I don't mind sharing a sweet crepe, but it's not something I'd normally order on my own. Savory crepes on the other hand is a different story... Enter La Maison de Maggie with as many savory crepe selections as the sweet variety...allowing us the opportunity to order away. I was able to try the France, Sophie, and Matt. These were all savory crepes and, as such, made with buckwheat flour (the sweet counterparts are made with whole-wheat floor). I liked the crispy, almost overcooked, execution of these savory delights. I wasn't overly impressed with the chicken or ham in these options, but at the inexpensive price I wasn't really expecting to be either.  Maggie was a one-person-show the day we came in, taking orders, making the crepes, and serving them as well. She was efficient, though it wasn't terribly busy at the time...A couple large groups came in when we were finishing up and I wondered how she would do then. The setting is nice-adorned with pleasing lighting and otherwise simply decorated with a few large pictures. There is also a long counter with seating. The space is finished with a few other items for sale, such as jams made in-house.  I'd come back, as well as recommend it to anyone looking for a sweet or savory crepe experience.",

I've been going to Rosallie pretty regularly but they don't do too many heated dishes, so Maggie's is here to fill the gap: menu includes both sweet and savory crepes made to order, and some coffee and smoothie beverages for a bit of something extra.   SOPHIE: Mozzarella, red pepper, and mushroom. Simple but so good! BF inhaled his portion while I savored mine. It was hard to decide what to order because all of the options sound good, definitely coming back to try more! LOULOU: Vanilla custard jam and whipped cream? Yes please! I'm not a huge crepe fan, or much of a dessert person, but I really enjoyed this option, which is one of the simpler offerings.  ICED COFFEE: Great brew, served in a double-wall tumbler for dining in, refills were offered. This was just strong enough, and made me interested in trying other caffeinated drinks on my next visit!   Location isn't noticeable from the street, tucked into a small plaza with a few vacant spots. Service was super-sweet and interior is cute and rustic. I can see myself coming back frequently to experience the great food and service.  TIP: Check in when you walk in, there's a Yelp offer for 10% off. You can get one savory option, one sweet option, and a drink for under $20. Not bad at all!",

    "text": "Not just done right, done perfect!   For what La Maison de Maggie lacks in style this place makes up for in flavor. I sat at the bar and ordered two crepes; a savory and sweet. The Nancy (savory) is filled with fluffy egg whites, turkey, and fresh spinach. I'm trying to watch the heavy food intake these days so this was the perfect light lunch meal. All the fixings inside were amazingly fresh, the spinach still had that crunch, the eggs were like soft protein filled pillows, and the turkey wasn't that pressed deli stuff, but sliced fresh gobble, gobble goodness.   The Alli (sweet) was on point, the menu states that this comes with either sugar or cinnamon, but I requested both, sugar on the inside and cinnamon on the outside. This was the perfect cap during my lunch and I highly suggest anyone who comes here to get both a sweet and savory crepe, they have about ten options of each.   I do have to mention, the crepes here taste nothing like any crepe I've had anywhere in Vegas, or beyond for that matter. They're light, soft, and have a delightful sublet flavor. I would even use the word, \"elegant\" to describe these. After I was done I was told that a large portion of the menu ingredients and cooking techniques are directly from Paris and the surrounding areas. I should have known, because the entire staff here has the thickest of French accents.   Seriously, are you a crepe lover? Then get here now!   C'est manifique!",

I had the France with egg ham and cheese and the egg was perfectly cooked sunny side up. My wife had the Marion with chicken and loved it. The good thing about those galettes is that they are made with buckwheat flour (imported from France such as the chestnut jam) so they are gluten free.   The second time my wife had a salad and  it was very fresh and the homemade dressing was out of this world.   Try their coffees and hot chocolate they are just very tasty. Add some homemade (no sugar) vanilla whipped-cream on the hot chocolate, it's the best !  The owner and the staff are French. Maggie is a sweetheart and the dishwasher is so funny. He has a cute  French accent and love to talk with everybody.   Just found out that La Maison de Maggie is now listed on the YelpTop 100 for 2017 as #44, well deserved !!! Go and try it now !",

By that evening I had realized I had forgotten my cup, and it was something given to me and has of great sentimental value. I waited until the next day to come back (Tuesday) and the place was closed. So I waited until Wednesday and I had called first thing in the morning. Needless to say, she (the owner) said she THREW IT OUT already IMMEDIATELY after I had left on Monday.   Like really... WTF!?!?!  Yes, I realize it was my mistake and my fault for forgetting, but more importantly, this shows of how this PERSON thinks, treats and have disregard for ANYTHING left behind    YOUR KINDNESS ENDS WHERE THE BUCK ENDS...  So much for that \"French Experience\" mentality.... YOU do not SHOW the TRUE EUROPEAN or FRENCH HOSPITALITY, nor way of RESPECT as a RESTAURANT/BUSINESS OWNER if someone leaves something behind, whether it was value to you or not personally.   You food was fantastic, but YOU will NEVER get my business again... and I will share this with others.",

There is no need to fear getting a poorly made coffee here like other places. Maggie has standards and most importantly CONSISTENCY! Great service too which is obviously key to a great experience.  Also, the mimosas we ordered were delicious because of the fact that Maggie uses REAL champagne in them and not sparkling wine. Also, the coffee is Lavazza brand! Honestly, you have to try La Maison to Maggie if you're in the mood for a great quality meal. As a French man, I know French quality food, and this is truly French quality food!",

    "text": "La Maison de Maggie (House of Maggie) Owned by Maggie Reb is a wonderful little cozy place for Crepes. In fact I adore the little hideaway spot, you might actually miss if you don't spot the sign. The people who work here are very nice. And very respectful. And French! Or Jewish French. As Reb is a Jewish name in Origin. What a bonus! Anyway, my order was a Nutella filled Crepe. I usually go to this Asian lady on South Fort Apache by Kentucky Fried Chicken for the best Crepes, but I wanted to try this out. Something New. Something different. As authentic maybe? Not quite! Honestly, it was very short of what you would expect in France at all. I've been there many times too! Very plain, and mundane Crepe's. It was like toasted pancake with a slab of Nutella, a couple of banana slices and slightly old fruits. The fruits were actually old and mushy. I will admit. The Crepe Wrap is homemade and tasty, though mine was slightly under cooked. This is the main thing that makes these taste so good. Just the Wrap. Throw the rest away. The price was a little above average. The main thing, is my Crepe was small for the amount of money. Maybe I got use to the Football sized ones from the Asian Lady. But at least the Asian Lady uses the freshest Organic Fruits, and Cremes, and stuffs it like crazy, as if bulging out the sides. And it weighs a couple pounds too!. This place makes them weak and small. 1 Crepe and a Cappuccino, was almost 18 Bucks. And didn't fill a bag much for take out. This place can improve alot. And if it doesn't, no matter what the hype, it will vanish in the Desert Wind like many others here do. I will back to update this, when I sneak in again!",

These were not among the best. Nice little place, Super clean. Very reasonable prices.",

    "text": "A little gem for delicious healthy eating! Occasionally Yelp leads you to a place you would have never found on your own.  Thank you Yelp for leading me to La Masion de Maggie! Maggie is a \"celebrity chef\" from the south of France who imported a little bit of France to Las Vegas.  French Maggie. French staff. French menu. But most important to me- French ingredients (ok, the coffee is from Italy!) For the healthier inclined- the galettes (buckwheat crepes) are made to be meals.  Delicious, filling, nonGMO gluten free meals. Like most Americans, I used to think of buckwheat from buckwheat pancakes- but more recent digging on my part has discovered what a \"superfood\" buckwheat is (see link below).   For the less healthy inclined- the imported French wheat crepes are a bit sweeter and have dessert toppings. French wheat is naturally low gluten and most 'gluten sensitive\" Americans have discovered they can eat French wheat with no problems.  At last you can eat delicious, organic, GMO free meals with no worries. Every mother in SW Las Vegas should be dragging her kids here every day! The ambiance is great. Maggie is a kick and the other staff I have seen here are either from France (or Quebec perhaps which works for me too).  Stop in and see Maggie (et ses amis) when you want a delicious inexpensive bite (or Italian cup of coffee) with no worries attached.

It was perfect in every way, diced roast chicken, creamy, melts cheese and sauteed mushrooms, perfectly salted and savory.  France - ham, cheese and a soft egg in the center.  My hubby inhaled it.

Creperies in France are usually very small places with a Britanny farm decor but this restaurant have been design with simple and good taste.The menu on a chalk board  look attractive with wide variety of crepes Salty an Sugary. I was happy to see the place offering some fresh smoothies. I let the owner know I was on a plant base diet and let her decide what I should eat. My lunch was made \"a la minute\" and all ingredients were fresh. The positive attitude, great service, excellent fresh food and constant smile from Maggie made a huge difference on my entire experience. Today I changed my vision of \"Creperies\" and I will definitely go back. Thank you Maggie !",

I had the Alex dessert with pears and caramel. It melted in my mouth. I was visiting from out of state but my next visit to Vegas I know exactly where I am heading for breakfast or lunch.",

If you're looking for the crepe experience just like in France, this is the place! (I'm French). If you're looking for an Americanized version, you may be disappointed. For example, you won't find any ketchup at La Maison de Maggie, but you will find French mustard. The flour is imported from France, and you'll even find gluten free options. The smoothies are so fresh - made with fruits/veggies picked up at a local farm.  The restaurant closes too early to my taste (6pm), but Maggie is alone and does everything herself. Given the quality of the food, it's ridiculously cheap (a savory crepe = a full meal = less than 10 bucks). I hope Maggie raises her prices because I want her to stay in business!  I wish the place was a little more decorated, but Maggie is so friendly she warms up the atmosphere :)",

So to find a cafe that serves both sweet and savory crepes, plus traditional Butter Sugar Crepes and everything in between owned by someone who is French, makes my heart sing.  I have been here three times and had both savory and sweet crepes. I have always found that what goes into a crepe and the portions can make or break a crepe. They can be as simple as a Butter Sugar Crepe or the delicious Polo Galette- filled with Blue Cheese, Ham and Spinach. The savory crepes are served with a salad as well, so you get your greens. All are made with the French attitude of the love for food, Tres Bon!  The patrons and the owner, Maggie, are very French. So don't be surprised to hear the language spoken around you or the lovely French accent of Maggie. If you do have the chance to meet Maggie, while eating a Crepe and listening to the patrons around you it definitely creates a traditional French vibe . This is a fabulous place- I love it.  Merci, Maggie!",

The only thing that stood out was the Dunkin Donuts and Arby's in this small shopping plaza that is across the street from Desert Breeze Park. However, once you enter this small yet inviting restaurant, you're warmly greeted by the friendly staff. The cool thing about this cafe is the open bar where you're able to watch your crepe being made. It reminded me of the many crepe places in France.   I ended up getting the Nancy Galette (savory crepe) which contains Egg Whites, Turkey, and Fresh Spinach. It was simply delicious and consistent throughout. The buckwheat was not dried out and was soft in texture. I didn't get a chance to try their Sweet Crepes, since I was planning to try another cafe in the area.  As for the Galettes, I would definitely recommend this place. I was able to try the Matt Galette which contains Chicken, Mushrooms, and Cheese. Overall, a great French spot in Vegas!  2017 Yelp Review #5",

It was located in a nondescript, relatively new plaza with plenty of parking.  Unit itself is calm, slightly dim, and away from the hustle and bustle.    We had a galette (savoury buckwheat crepe) each and they came with a side salad.  I believe it was the owner, Maggie who greeted us, made the crepes, and did the serving.  Crepes were delicious, light, but satisfying for breakfast.  The only reason why my review fell short of 5*s is because the coffee wasn't great.  Having said that, I never really had a good coffee during my stay in Vegas.  I'd definitely come back when I'm in town next!",

Needless to say, I am a huge fan of La Mansion de Maggie.  When you walk in the restaurant you will see two big boards one with \"Buckwheat Flour Crepes,\" which contains their savory selections and another with \"Whole Wheat Flour Crepes \" which contains their sweet selections.  I ordered a cappuccino, and \"French\" which is Egg, Ham, and Cheese. I also added Spinach for $1 extra. There is a water station right by the door that is self serve...my love brought our table some water while we waited for our crepes and my drink. My Cappuccino came in a double insulated cup that kept my coffee hot throughout my dining. Mademoiselle Maggie has three Crepe cookers on and was manning the kitchen herself, as well as taking and serving all the orders.  All three of us in our party ordered savory crepes, which all came with small salads with a perfectly balanced mustard dressing.  The Crepes were a perfect shape and void of burnt edges. The egg on my crepe came sunny side up egg and sat right in the middle of it.  I love how simple and delicate the crepe was...no fuss...just an envelope of good ingredients in a perfectly cooked Buckwheat flour crepe.   I will definitely come back here.",

No cozy date booth, but it's fun to enjoy the company of other people enjoying the same thing as you.  It's a small place so sometimes there's a wait for seating.   There are two options for crepes,  1 savory menu and the other sweet.   The savory is naturally gluten free.  The sweet you must request the gluten free batter and let them know if you've a severe reaction and they can heat up the spare grill for you.   Savory crepes come with a small salad tossed with their homemade dressing.  I wish they would sell it,  it's so very good and simple.   These are authentic crepes done in  the French style.  They're rather large.  Two of us usually order 1 of each savory and sweet then share them.  They serve some alcoholic drinks,  have coffee served in french fashion.  No sweet starbucks concoctions here.  Just good ,strong correct coffee.   The owner is super friendly and nice to chat with if the place is slow when you go in.  It's definitely a hidden gem.",

I sat at the counter after reading the galettes and crepes descriptions on the large menu boards.  I ordered the galette of the month and a black coffee.  The coffee was brought quickly in a glass that kept the coffee very hot for a long time.  I watched as the young woman made some crepes that were being taken out and two galettes for other customers eating in house.  And, I had the fun of watching her make my galette.  The galette, made with buckwheat batter, was quite good.  The cheese and tomatoes had a lot of flavor but the honey was very light in adding anything to the dish.  While waiting, I chatted with Madame Maggie and I looked at her homemade jams for sale on the counter.  I need to go back and try a sweet crepe.  The Nutella seems to be calling me.  It's good to have a creperie like this not too far from home.",

You need this place in your life!  Long version:  Cleanliness 5/5 & Decor 5/5 This place is huge!  Everything has been spotless. It feels like you are visiting someone's very tidy home.  Service 5/5 Maggie make this place even better that it already is.  She's very helpful and patient.  Even when you are just sitting there, she will continue to check in every so often to make sure that you have everything that you need.  You can tell that she has a strong eye for detail with everything in her shop.  It really doesn't get better.  Food 5/5 I ended up here because of the gluten free menu. As a result, I've only had the savory side of the menu.  It's all fantastic.  The tomatoes are fresh.  The crepes are spot on!  She did not skimp on the quality of the cheeses. The side salad is very basic, but I'm okay with that.  My fiance has had the sweeter crepes.  He looked so happy eating it that he got teased a bit.  To me the latte was by far one of the best I've had out here in Vegas.  I bought a can of the loose leaf tea to go because I enjoyed it that much.  This place will probably become a weekly visit for me.  Thanks, Maggie!",

I had a great espresso and they even treated us to a free Alex (pear, caramel, cinnamon). All absolutely delicious!  Had interesting conversation about France... and they use imported French flour (less processed, no bleaching). The kids absolutely loved the French imported Kinder chocolate eggs with toys in them.

Maggie, whose maison this is, is a French chef right out of your foodiest fantasy. Lately, she's been a one-woman dynamo, churning out crepes and croque madames and fresh smoothies and dozens of other dishes cooked with organic ingredients by her gifted hands. We've tried a number of dishes and drinks and are looking forward to coming back for more. The crepes are creamy and light, her salads are so good you'll want thirds, and her coffee is as delicious as we've  had in France. As for the atmosphere, all the customers were friendly and relaxed on a recent weekend morning, and so was Maggie--despite cooking and mixing and whisking at one helluva pace.  The decor is nothing too fancy, but it's authentic (with a few Americanized pieces to Francais it up) and open and 100 percent Maggie. This is how many French eat, or very close to it. We've eaten alongside them across France. \"The food is the thing,\" one elderly French woman once told me. \"It's why we French will drive two hundred kilometers for a great meal.\"  I don't know long that is, but it sounds very far. Still, after eating Maggie's food, I'd drive across this whole desert to get it.",

    "text": "I finally tried what some publications and people have called the best crepes in Las Vegas. I can't quite concur with that high praise though.  La Maison de Maggie is a little shop not far from Desert Breeze Park that offers crepes, galettes (savory buckwheat crepes), smoothies, and drinks both non-alcoholic and otherwise. They're in the back of a plaza containing an Arby's and are sandwiched between some driving school and the ironically liquor license-less breakfast/lunch spot Mimosas.  We were greeted promptly upon entry and nudged to order at the register before sitting, which is pretty much standard at these places. Glad I was able to save on the bill because the offerings here are pricey. Nevertheless, we ordered, found a table, then received our order relatively quickly. It was after when any typical weekday lunch rush would happen, so hopefully this wasn't a bad sign for them.  France ($11): galette with egg (chose sunny side up rather than scrambled), ham, and cheese. I enjoyed the galette itself, the runny yolk, and the ham and cheese. It felt like I got a little more cheese in a thicker form in this galette than at my favorite galette, but I didn't quite enjoy the flavors of the ham and cheese as much here. Plus, this galette is significantly more expensive.  Tom ($8): crepe with Nutella, banana, whipped cream. Loved the chewiness of the crepe and the Nutella, and banana had the right ripeness/sweetness. The whipped cream was good, but it wasn't magical as I've had at some places. The price is the same as my local favorite crepe, but the flavors were merely delicious and not heavenly.  Iced coffee ($2.50): strong coffee flavor, not too bitter, doesn't have that \"grassy\" tone that I've experienced and disliked from Stumptown and other roasters. It's the one area that's superior to the offerings at my favorite crepe spot.  I would love to give 4.5 stars to La Maison de Maggie, but considering the limitations of Yelp's rating system and my unwillingness to place this on the same level as my favorite crepe place (let's just say they're named for the Brittany region of France), I'll have to round down to 4. The crepe and galette menu does have more variety here, so hopefully I can try some of the less familiar offerings if and when I get a little bored of the other creperie. However, both are pretty far from my Henderson home, so I don't foresee that happening very often.",

I'm pretty simple when it comes to my crepe tastes...a classic butter and sugar for me please.

They serve smoothies, crepes galette, and coffee. The patrons will bring the food to you. We sat at the bar and watched our crepes being made by Maggie.  We both had galette (savoury buckwheat crepe) each and they came with a side salad. Crepes we ordered were Polo - ham, blue cheese, fresh spinach and Flying Baby- tomato, mozzarella and blue cheese. You can add any ingredient for $1.  The Crepes were thin and light and flavourful. I didn't get a chance to try their Sweet Crepes. The owner, Maggie introduced her homemade jams and she mentioned her produce were locally grown at Gilcrease Orchard.",

    "text": "La Maison de Maggie is an authentic French crepe shop located just west of the Soccer Complex, next to Mimosa Gourmet. Prior to finding out about these two places, I thought this complex was essentially dead. A lot of previous shops closed in this strip mall. The only original one left is Arby's. Even Carl's Jr is gone and changed to a Dunkin Donuts. LOL   We had unexpectedly came here after finding out about a 35-45 minute wait next door at Mimosa Gourmet, on a Sunday. We had saw that La Maison de Maggie had a 5 star rating with over 300 reviews. Somethings gotta be good for it to be this highly rated ! So nextdoor we went.   Outside of the shop has a chalk board with specials listed. On 05/20/18, they had 4 specials.   \"Crepe Suzette\"  \"Galette of the Month\" w/ Goat Cheese, Cranberries, Onions, and Walnuts  \"Crepe Nutella\"  \"Croque-Monsieur\"   They regularly have 7 different crepes and 7 galettes [buckwheat and flour made crepes - gluten free] on the menu inside the restaurant. I guess crepes are the sweet type, and galettes are the savory type? I totally skipped out on looking at galettes when I was there cuz I saw it was gluten free XD oops. Little did I know, that was what my friend had highly recommended in his review....  This place is the 'you place your order at the cashier and take your seat' kind of a cafe style. It was fairly quiet on Sunday early afternoon but soon after, it became busier. Lol   The restaurant is quite cute. I'm not sure how to describe it. Mildly rustic. French styled? They had a side facing clock like what you'd see at a train station too ! Dimly lit.   I had ordered the 'Crepe Suzette' whereas my friend had ordered the 'Lauren'. She had ordered a normal iced tea whereas I had ordered a 'Micka' smoothie  'Lauren' is a wheat flour crepe w/ nutella, strawberry, and whipped cream  Of the two crepes we had, this was really delicious. Crepe was fairly thick and folded. Thin layer of nutella and slices of strawberry inside the crepe. Light whipped cream piped outside on the plate. Simple but delicious.   'Micka' is a smoothie w/ spinach, kale, pineapple, grapes, flax seeds, and agave  Simple smoothie with the above listed ingredients. They didn't blend it enough so it was still kinda chunky and hard to drink with straw.   \"Crepe Suzette\" w/ zesty homemade orange jam and Grand Marnier liquor  I was warned there was liquor in this when I ordered it which I was fine with. I had expected as much with it listing Grand Marnier which is an orange liquor. I know I've heard of 'crepe suzette' before and I think its a fairly known \"crepe\" in France. So that's what I got.   Little did I know they were gonna bring out the crepe with the zesty homemade orange jam inside on a plate... then the Grand Marnier lit in a pot, pouring it on top of the crepe at tableside. I didn't expect how much liquor they'd use... They drenched the crepe ! it was swimming in liquor ! I know some people wouldn't complain about that... but ugh all I tasted was liquor. I don't know if the crepe soaked up and I ingested it most of it in the beginning, or I got used to it, the crepe tasted better later on. I noticed the homemade jam was really tasty but wished they were a little lighter handed on the amount of liquor. I cut a small piece for my friend to try and she had instant regret. INSTANT. LOL her face scrunched up so fast. XD it was borderline bitter with the amount of alcohol. I didn't know Grand Marnier was flammable. I feel like they mixed it with something to light it. I can't dock rating for something I was warned about. The orange jam they used is really delicious with seemingly candied orange peel in it too. I believe all their jams are homemade so I cant wait to try other ones they have !   The owner, Maggie, was super nice. She was the one who took order order, did my crepe suzette, and ran out thanking us for the $2 bill tip we left on the table. What a funny person ! Would love to come back and try the galettes and other crepes ! too bad they close by the like 3-4pm so it definitely not during a weekday/workday.",

I would say that they should offer non sugar for the coffee such as splenda/ Truvia etc. since they only offered raw sugar. I brought a friend for her first visit and the environment was too quiet for us to have our coffee buzzed chit chat. I mean the nice french music that was playing was so low in the background that it felt like people could hear your conversations, so just a recommendation to maybe add to the ambiance and have music on a little louder. Love to come here and highly recommend.",

We were able to get our food quickly and leave and the aesthetics were very pleasing, but it just wasn't what I was hoping for. Very disappointed. :(",

Learned while I was there that all the flower is imported from France (where the chef is actually from) and is gluten free.  Truly incredible!  Fluffy and light (two adjectives that shouldn't go together but when they do...magic).  Highly recommend this place.  My only complaint is that it isn't closer to me :)",

Additionally, you cannot beat their price of $12 for bottomless mimosas with True French champagne.  Her recommendation for a Sweet Crepe is the \"Alli\" filled with only sugar. Although unassuming it is a True game changer, absolutely delectable. The sugar provides the right amount of sweetness and is the perfect final touch to any meal had here.  Ambiance is nice and very welcoming. Soft French music fills the space, creating a True authentic experience.   Will definitely be back!",

Fun fact each menu item is named after family members of the owners that are still in France.   I've had many crepes before however this is the first time I got a galette which is made of buckwheat and has a light flavor to it. The Maison has mozzarella Cheese pesto and tomatoes. There's was also a side salad with a mustard type dressing. The pesto in the Maison is very yums. I especially like the slight crunch and crispness of the galette. Nice light texture.   The Nancy galette was also very good. It consisted of turkey and spinach. We added cheese. My boyfriend doesn't eat spinach and I was expecting him to peel off the spinach but he didn't. That can show you just how yums the galette was.   The sweet crepes we gotwere the Lauren and the Tom. These crepes have a wheat base. They were both very good. The Nancy has Nutella whip cream and strawberry. The Tom the same except with bananas. The Suzette has an apricot jam with lavender with puree over butter and a sweet alcohol that they light on fire. This was a delight and added entertained the kids a bit.   We also got lattes which were large in size and hot. Taste was good also. They have flavors you can add to the lattes like vanilla, caramel, and hazelnut.   Overall, authentic French crepe place. Try this place :)",

Fresh off the stove (or whatever you cook crepes on), the crepes always come warm and delicious. I would definitely recommend the sweet crepes over the savory, but both are very good.

I tried the galette of the month: mozzerella, goat cheese, bacon crumbles, and onions. Then my lovely pal tried his namesake, the Matt galette, featuring chicken and mushrooms. Then for dessert, the Crepe Suzette: zesty orange jam (which Maggie makes herself!) + flaming Grand Marnier. She poured it in front of us, and the heady aromas and flavors, as the flames curled about the crepe, were enough for me to exclaim, \"well, it's 5 o'clock somewhere!\" as I took my first bite.",

Order the french classic crepes (ham, cheese and sunny side up egg and a sugar and butter crepe) The place is LOVELY and clean! The galette was very good and hit the spot! I think next time I will ask Maggie the owner to add more cheese to my galette. The butter and sugar crepe was delicious! I don't like much sweet so that crepe is just perfect.   I Love that she sells some french product like the Grenadine or the Menthe Teisseire syrups! When I was a kid my mom would mix it with some water! Yup back in the days, in France we did not much drink sodas but we had Teisseire syrups!!  I will gladly come back! Didn't even know we had a great crepes place in town till I found La Maison de Maggie!",

That idea sprung into my head as I had my first tomato, mozzarella and pesto galette.   La Maison de Maggie is a charming crepe restaurant on Durango and DI. The menu is broken down into the savory (breton) galettes and the sweeter crepes. My memory is garbage and though I've been back three or four times and am resolved to try everything on the menu, I end up mistakenly ordering that same tomato, mozzarella and pesto galette. That said, I've since dragged back family and friends and they can vouch for the rest of the menu.  I've seen the same one woman cooking/running the entire restaurant and she's always been incredibly hospitable. The space is smallish so it might fill up during peak breakfast/lunch hours but as I've always been there at off hours, I've just been able to enjoy a quiet gallete with friends and family.  I can't say enough good things about this place (nor can everyone else on yelp it seems). Still, if you haven't been - give it a shot. If you have been, go back - you've been gone for too long.",

If you need more, you can still go for a croque monsieur, toasted sandwiches filled with Swiss cheese and ham and covered with butter and Swiss cheese! You prefer veggies food? Go for the smoothies.

I am a crepe fanatic and also very picky about how they taste, however this was very good. They have 22 different types . I had the Tom, which consist of Nutella, Banana, and whip cream. I also had ice cream which was absolutely tasty .",

Everything about this restaurant from it's fresh, clean, deliciously prepared food, to its owner and chef is truly remarkable! There is nothing like it for breakfast anywhere, and is certainly some of the best French food we have ever enjoyed! When we visited the owner had only had the restaurant open 18 months but she is truly doing an outstanding job and I hope people will support her and keep her in business and make her successful. If I lived in town I would probably have breakfast here at least once a week, and would really look forward to trying some of her lunches and dinners at another time. This is truly an authentic European French cafe and everything about it was exquisite and so different from anything typical American, it was very refreshing.",

I ordered The Nancy. It had turkey and spinach, not strong or light flavor but just right.  Whoever go in there next, do not forget to sign their guest book at the counter.  If you've never eaten a French crepe, this is the place to go.  10 year old: The Flying Baby has mozzarella, Bleu cheese and tomato. It was too strong of bleu cheese taste so I switched (took the crepe from) with my dad.  He ordered a vegetarian crepe with a girl's name that had red peppers, cheese and mushroom. I liked it thisssssssssss much (with outstretched arms side to side).  If you're in the mood for something delicious, go there.",

The decor is simple and elegant and manages to convey a lived-in and homey feeling. The service is excellent and the food and coffee are amazing. We ordered the France galette, the Tom crepe with extra strawberries and ice cream, iced coffee, and regular coffee. They were out of bananas for the Tom crepe and actually went out to get more bananas just for our order.   I will definitely come back to try more items off the menu in the future!",

I ordered a sweet and salty crepe. My favorite were the sweet options. I tried the Nutella and bananas as well as the pear and cinnamon. They were both great. Their sweet fruit glazed was very tasty. For my savory option I had the chicken with mushroom and mozzarella cheese. I liked the texture of the crepe and the flavor of the mushroom. However, I wish the crepe would have include some type of sauce on top as it lacked a bit of flavor. Overall, a nice little cafe if you are craving some authentic French crepes!",

I came here during the start of the Christmas season, the ambiance here is so beautiful with Christmas decorations, listening to Jingle Bells in French definitely raised festive levels.    The Galette (savory crepes) & regular sweet Crepes involve authentic French buckwheat and wheat flour which are imported from France. Crepe tends to feel light on the stomach and unlocks the natural flavor from the fresh ingredients to come alive. They don't add lots of ingredients to the crepes, quite frankly it doesn't need more stuff, sometimes keeping it simple is the best. I actually had room enough to eat two crepes, in France that's very common.    Maggie (owner) is very kind, friendly person and she's passionate about the products she makes. She loves her culture and wants to deliver on that taste of France experience all the time.   These are my favorites so far, I have to go back try some more. The Marion - mozzarella cheese, tomato, pesto.  The Alli - Cinnamon and powdered sugar.",

Savory Crepes - not greasy breakfast Dessert crepes - light sweet and delicious.  Not overly sweet like candy Beverages - coffee, latte, and hot chocolate were on par Service - Maggie was delightful and friendly.  She had family visiting out of town who donned Santa hats and aprons to help serve us.  Such nice people! Decor - we sent the kids around the room to learn the French writing around via translation apps.  Great mini game to keep them occupied and learn something profound  We wish you success Maggie.

We were probably the only non-French speakers in the restaurant at the time, which added to the cafe's charm. Although I was too full to order a dessert crepe, my husband and I each got a galette. They were both filling and tasty, but my unrefined American palette would prefer more sauce (or ketchup lol) so it doesn't taste too dry. I would highly recommend getting a smoothie with your order; the smoothie we ordered was so refreshing and had a nice balance of greens and sweetness from the fruit. The owner was very accommodating and checked on us and other tables often. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you get.",

Both times I had the LouLou (LuLu??) with the chestnut jam.  It is so good. I wanted to try the pear, caramel and cinnamon crepe, The Alex, but I didn't know how messy that would be since I was on my way to work and am famous for spilling things on my shirt I decided to play it safe.  Guess I will just have to go back again when I have an extra shirt...oh, shucks! It's very reasonably priced but it's tucked into a plaza behind Arby's and Dunkin' so it is literally a hidden gem worth the search, believe me! Maggie imports the chestnut jam from France and has jars for sale. I bought one of you want to come over for breakfast...The inside is very comfortable. Nice large tables and just cute and inviting all the way around.  Usually you pay first.  It wasn't that busy and Maggie seemed to be working on another order so she just asked me what I wanted and told me to sit down and relax and I could pay after, she pointed out the water and came over to make sure I was happy.",

I had the Marion galette ($9) with mozzarella, tomato, and pesto and it was delicious and made with high quality ingredients. The best thing for me is that their galettes are made with buckwheat flour which is gluten free. I was recently diagnosed with a pretty bad gluten intolerance so this makes me so happy. My friend had the Tom crepe ($8) and she said it was also delicious. All sweet crepes are not gluten free and made with wheat flour and I definitely wish I could have tried one! I believed we were being served by the owner judging by the crepe-inspired license plate on the car parked directly in front of the restaurant :) She was very friendly and sweet.  We really enjoyed our quick bite here. Unfortunately it's in a strip mall notorious for shops going out of business so I hope they can maintain a steady customer base. I will definitely come back.",

Chef Maggie imports all of her flour from France and personally shops for fresh ingredients several times per week. A hand-made meal made in front of me more than exceeded my hopes and filled me up.  And to top it off, she took time from her busy day to share her story. Such a personable and kind person who works hard to make great food. You can hear her passion for what she does.  Take the time to find Chef Maggie and you will walk away full and glad you did!",

    "text": "Anyone who is French, or has been to France has a place in their heart for crepes and now we have a True creperie here in Vegas. Once you walk through the door you are taken to another place far from home. We are over run by chain restaurants and it is a pleasant change to have a restaurant with its own unique vibe and to hear french spoken again is a plus! In fact come here if you want to put your french to the test!  What I LOVED.... I am gluten free, and I have not seen gluten free crepes except in Montreal, so I crossed my fingers. Gluten-free often mean tasteless or bad texture, well in this case, I was pleasantly surprised because the buckwheat crepe was fabulous. In fact, my friend could not leave without having a dessert crepe and graciously offered to share a gluten free one, and she was impressed as well. Tell your gluten free friends to come here! This is gluten free dream come True!  I had the Sophie crepe with cheese, red pepper and mushrooms and it was wonderful. The savory ones are served with a small side salad, and there is an option to order a larger salad and you can choose five items.  I have to say, between my meal and the split dessert I was full in a nice way. I try to avoid gut bombs, and I also don't like to walk away hungry. We split the chestnut vanilla jam filled crepe and it was to die for! I heard about the jam from a woman who ate there and buys it from the owner. I also had a latte and almond milk is an option. This is a small place and it is fantastic that they accommodate dietary restrictions.   The owner is from France and imports most of the ingredients, yes it may seem pricy to some, but it makes up for itself in flavor and ambiance.  I love the retail items she had and I kicked myself for not grabbing a jar of the chestnut vanilla jam. That is ok because I plan on returning with my Mom this week because there is a psychic who does readings and they have a special combo with a 15 minute reading!  Say Bonjour to Maggie when you go to eat!   Bon Appetite in my best Julia Child voice!",

The inside is a little light on the ingredients, but you come to a creperie like this for the French cooking not the ingredients.  The coffee was solid as well.    The menu consists of a sweet and a regular menu.  Each meal is about $10 and ingredients can be added at $1 a pop.  I thought the meal was very good and authentic, but unless you have a craving for a True crepe and a non-filing meal, I believe there are better options out there.",

    "text": "Now let me start off by saying we did not order what they are known for, that is buckwheat crepes. We instead went off Tue special board band ordered croque monsieur. We have ordered that at other French cafe so we thought it would be a good comparison. What came to us was plain white bread toasted with 2 slices of cheese and a slice of ham. The crusts were cut off. A side salad of greens and mustrrad dressing. Needless to say it was a great disappointment. No coffee refills also. I was so,looking forward to another great French cafe but I doubt I will ever go back. If I do it will be for a crepe. By the way Sharrie was going to have a crepe but she hates a runny yolk and when asked if they would cool it hard the answer was scrambled or runny. Not the right answer!",

My wife and I had a wonderful experience and will be coming back for as long as she decides to stay in Las Vegas before leaving for Paris.  Her menu has something for everyone, no matter what you are in the mood for. If you want something hardy and savory, she has you covered...If you are in the mood for something sweet, just take your pick. While we were eating, Maggie stopped by our table to check on us. She explained to us how she imports her flour directly from Paris...and you can really taste the quality, effort, and love she puts into every crepe.",

I chose the Polo which had gorgonzola cheese, spinach and ham. it's pretty dang stinky but yummy. Thats the only way I know how to explain it lol. Mom had the Matt which consisted of cheese, mushroom and chicken. I tasted hers too and it was very good. Try this place out if you want lunch or have a sweet tooth.",
