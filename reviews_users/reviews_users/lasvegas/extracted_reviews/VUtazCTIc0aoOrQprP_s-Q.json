I ordered a vodka cranberry instead, which was extremely bitter. One was enough for me.  The band that was playing was FANTASTIC. Seriously, theyw ere amazing. They play not only country, but a lot of rock, and even surprised us with their rendition of \"ice ice baby\"!  I would go back for the band. And possibly the drinks, if I'm not paying for them myself again.",

    "text": "Terrible experience. Went to this bar/restaurant while visiting Vegas to watch the steelers/chiefs playoff game. Food and drinks were overpriced and nothing to write home about. Service was terrible. They advertise themselves as a sports bar, but to our surprise the waitress (under the direction of her manager) tried to kick us out after being there for an hour and a half. We were still purchasing drinks (or attempting to, but the waitress stopped coming to our table) and still eating our food, as we ordered appetizers first and then our entrees. I could understand the restaurant trying to get rid of our table if we were simply sitting there for hours sipping on water and not spending more money, but it was quite the opposite. The manager (Haley) came to our table when asked and was very rude and had no explanation as to why this was happening. Do not go here for a sporting event if you plan to watch the whole game.  This is not advertised anywhere on their website.",

The buffalo sauce and the bbq were both fantastic. My cousin got the Rueben that left my mouth watering and I had the pulled pork. I added extra BBQ and it worked. The coleslaw and potato salad were just ok; the kind you'd get locally at the deli.   The waitresses either wore tight cutoffs or chaps with no pants. They had one underwear/bathing suit material on the bottoms, and obvious people tend to like that. Overall not a bad place but sort of loud as they played Keith's music the entire time.   Lots of TVs at the bar if you want to drink and catch a game though.",

There was a live band and they also played Top 40 hits in between sets. Our bartender, James, was freakin fabulous. He made us \"sweet but strong\" shots all night long. The only downside was the 24 hour recovery period, but that was likely my fault :) Can't speak to their food, but their bartenders, music and patrons made for a great night.",

    "text": "Ok, so I'm NOT into Country... Sure, I like a little Shania, a little Taylor Swift, and I know the words to \"Friends in Low Places\" but that's about as far as I go. But when you go to Vegas for someone's birthday, you do what the birthday girl wants. Only fair :)  So like almost every other black person who gets talked into going to a Country bar, I was a little worried about being sidelined by the unfamiliar line dancing and stared down for having a lot of pigment.LOL! But lo and behold, the only line dance for the night was the electric slide! Got that! And there was a United Nations-ish range of diversity throughout the bar. Well, alrighty then! The drinks were ok, and the bar had a lot of seats.... no cover charge or waiting in line either. It's more casual attire than dressy.  Bartenders put on a good show - bottle flipping, stacked shots, free shots, and some kind of simulated fellatio act with a loud alarm for the bachelorette parties.   Although I had fun with my friends, I was a little disappointed by the overall experience. Call me crazy, but it didn't seem \"country enough.\" I mean, I wasn't expecting hay and cowboys, but the cover band was kid of a let down. They played some country hits, and some rock hits (Come on Eileen, Take on Me, etc) but they weren't that great and then they just started playing a couple hip hop songs to keep people dancing...but, hello, you can't really dance to a cover version of \"California Love\"....um no.  My vote.... look for a legit C&W bar somewhere off the strip - not this commercialized space - or just go back to another swanky Vegas club...",

My only complaint is that they weren't very busy when we arrived, and yet we stood there like we were invisible watching 3 employees chatting away behind the host station right in front of us.  We finally asked if any of them were allowed to seat people.  They jumped to it and we were led to a table by a young girl in a sexy outfit.  Most of the girls wore them....all of the servers, anyway.  Their butt cheeks were on display underneath chaps.  That would be OK with me, if the good looking young guys who work there had to wear the same type garb.  If just the women wear these outfits, I feel it's exploiting them.  On the flip side, we ladies would like a little eye candy to.  My suggestion....everyone has butt cheeks on display, or no one has butt cheeks on display",

    "text": "I waited longer for a table than I would have expected given that the place wasn't quite full. The food was very slow to arrive, as well.   The Cajun Shrimp appetizer was decent -- a large portion, served hot, with a tasty dipping sauce. I believe the menu description is inaccurate in that the shrimp itself is not spiced at all. Not to say it's bad, just not what I was expecting.  The veggie wrap -- admittedly, not what most patrons are going to order in the land of excess that is Las Vegas -- was awful. The filling was about 95% shredded lettuce, with a few other bits of stuff thrown in for color, and a dressing that was not so much bland as just yucky. I considered sending it back, but it was nearly the only thing on the menu that didn't used to have hooves. By which I mean, I didn't have a lot of vegetarian-ish choices.  The service was slow throughout the meal, and the waitress had a habit of timing her drive-bys when I had a mouthful of food and couldn't say anything. As fast as she was moving, you'd think she'd make it back around more frequently, but no. Don't let your drink glasses get empty, as you'll be sitting there thirsty for a while.  All that said, the setting is lively, especially later at night when there's a band on stage. I'm not a fan of country or western, but I'd watch just about any good band live.   If you're just going for a quick meal, you're better off elsewhere (e.g. next door at Imperial Palace there's a decent homestyle mexican place).",

We were seated before another couple yet, somehow their food arrived before us and they had steak and we didn't. The food was decent, not bad, definitely not worth waiting for and nothing to rave about. Not worth the price of the food or the wait. There are so many other options in vegas to choose from.

Some of the negative reviews are definitely misleading. It's more of a sport bar during the day, so NO; they are not always going to be playing music. The food is good but nothing special either; but no one should go to sports bars or dance clubs for their food only, so why should TKB be rated just based on their food experience. Overall it's a very cool kickback place, in particular at the night time when the live music is going. We never have experienced any kind of drama and always end up meeting some very cool people there. I minus a star for their pricy food and the fact that not all bands are always that good. Maybe good as musicians, but some are not 100% country bands. Obviously you expect a kick ass COUNTRY band every time you hit the TKB, but sometimes you'll get that Rock/Pop/Country band that not everyone likes.",

We sat at the bar and I kept myself occupied with the video poker games at each seat. A very hungry Mike ordered a pulled pork sandwich and we got some Jack cocktails to tide us over. My drink was pretty strong, which certainly alleviated my losing streak at video poker. The food took at least 20-30 minutes to come out even though the bar was pretty much empty. I liked how they put your food on a cutting board if you're sitting at the bar. The portions weren't as big as I thought they would be given the prices they charged. Our server/bartender pretty much ignored us after Mike got his food so we hightailed it to Harrah's sports bar to watch the game.",

We always meet the greatest people here & look forward to going there every year! Im pretty sure we go to Vegas just because of this bar, would reccomend it to everyone, cant say enough good things about this establishment & its bartenders. (and security staff)",

Ive been here two times and both times the live bands have been wonderful playing country as well as classic rock. very fun the dance on the dance floor. The bartenders are really into it and make drinking even more fun. I have never had the food here but id expect nothing too exciting just bar food. but if youre looking for a fun place to dance, not have to dress up too much and have a good time with fun people i would try this place!",

    "text": "I only gave this place 3 stars because they have live country music bands perform there each night (bands that were chosen directly by Toby Keith himself supposedly).  The band was great the night I was there and the bar is nice and large, almost the size of a dance hall.  It's located on the 2nd floor of Harrahs, which is something most people need to know when trying to find this place.  Otherwise, I was not a big fan of this place simply because the domestic beer prices for BOTH bottle and draft were $7 EACH.  I can buy an entire six pack for that price!!  Since it was probably the last time I would ever visit Vegas again in my lifetime, I sucked it up and stayed for a little while.  However, I wouldn't go back.  Since there are very few good choices for country music bars in Vegas, I would recommend this place for those who are desparately looking for a country music bar in Vegas and don't mind paying $7 per beer.  They may have a happy hour with lower prices, but I cannot confirm that.  I know the bands start at 9pm each night and Happy Hour is over by then, if there is one at all.",

It was buy one get one free, so I was locked into this nightmare for about an hour.  Mercifully, since the football game was on, there was no ear-bleed-inducing garbage playing over the sound system, and the bartender was very nice.  These two reasons are the only thing that kept this review in the two star category.  I got a whiskey and coke and the thing was $10.  Ten!  Shit, I mean I know this is Vegas we're talking about, but this is an establishment that serves its beers in mason jars, so what are we talking about, here?  The food looked atrocious and stale, so I went nowhere near it, and I thank God for that decision, because the guy next to me eating nachos looked like he'd just been socked in the gut about five minutes after finishing his plate.  I didn't see the man again.  Needless to say, my visit to this place was short, and if there is any justice in this world, it will not be repeated.",

I love this place for the fact that it is so kicked back.  I can have a great time in my jeans and t-shirt.  Drinks are a serious business here since they are served in mason jars, so it doesn't take too many to get a quick buzz going.  Also, every time a Toby Keith song is played, everyone around the bar will get free shots.  (Yeah I know I am a lush, but hey)  The food is very tasty, with the fried macaroni balls being absolutely delicious and sinful.  If you are wanting to eat dinner here on a weekend though I would plan on arriving early.  I got there at 8pm on a Saturday night and didn't sit down to eat until nearly 9:30.  I don't really understand all the negative reviews, especially those that don't like country music.  I mean, why come here then?  But hey, I guess this is the beauty of Yelp, that everyone can review to their own tastes.  For me, this is one place that I will return to every visit to Vegas.",

Sat at the bar, took 25 minutes before anyone offered us a menu- even though they were all looking at us but kept horsing around & talking with other patrons who were obviously dressed to get a free drink. Once we got a menu (with not being asked what we would like to drink- hello? we are sitting at a BAR..) the bartender came back 15 minutes later to wash a glass and I had to let him know we were ready to order. He asked \"what do you want?\". It then took 20 minutes to get one order of appetizer chicken strips. The man who brought it out to us was very nice and polite and was the one to finally ask if we wanted something to drink. It of course took another 20 minutes after being done eating to get the idiot bartenders attention to ask for our bill. Needless to say- we did not tip. I am a big believer in cutting slack because servers/bartenders etc get busy- but really? 4pm on a Tuesday with 8 people at the bar, 5 of them flirting to get on the bartenders good side? I'll waste my time at Denny's down the road.  Toby- I love you but get some new staff.",

    "text": "Toby Keith's came highly recommended by a friend's wife so when we did a guys trip to Vegas we stopped in for dinner.  We were staying in Treasure Island so it was basically across and up the street for a 10 minute walk to Harrah's (somewhere upstairs).  It was a Tuesday night and we had about a 15-20 minute wait to get seated so we hung out at the bar.  The first thing to catch the eyes were the waitresses (maybe it was the oufit with the cowboy hat, boots and shorts and/or the friendly personalities?).  The service was also pretty good though the dinner entrees took a while to get served.  The appetizers were decent enough - wings, nachos (w/grilled chicken, guacomole, sour cream, tomatoes, etc.) and shrimp hush puppies.  The disappointments were the dinner entrees.  Not one of the five of us were thrilled with the dinner entrees.  The flat iron steak was sort of tough and not very tasty, the rotisserie chicken was dry, the grilled ny steak was sort of bland, the meatloaf was also somewhat cold and bland and the beer battered shrimp was more batter than shrimp.  We were there too early for the band, but there was some kind of free shot thing at the bar that they did at least once while we were there, though one waitress mentioned that the shot of whatever was watered down.  Probably won't go back next time we are in Vegas, but might be worth trying out at least one time.  There's also a poker room in the back that we were told was only open on the weekends.  Oh, and did I mention the waitresses?",

The first time was midday, probably around 3 in the afternoon and the place was dead but I wanted to go in for a drink.  They bartenders were friendly.  They temped me by putting a menu in front of me, where by boyfriend spotted the \"Fried Bologna Sandwich\" that he just HAD to try.  So we ordered it... and now I have a new favorite food.  The sandwich was AMAZING, and I don't even like bologna.  I would recommend it in a heartbeat. I also got some specialty margarita and it was delicious.  We went back the following night, probably around midnight and there was a band and the place was packed.  We had a great time dancing and having some drinks.  The beers in a mason jar are classic.  We bought two from the bar to take home.",

The food and service continues to fall well below what you would expect from this place.   We went over the past few years from big fans to stay away.  This most recent visit, we came in for lunch and got Nachos & the Cowboy Reuben. The nachos were just ok.  The Cowboy Reuben corned beef brisket was dry and the bread just overpowered the sandwich.  Too much bread.    We have tried many things on the menu in the past from burgers, quesadillas, and chicken sandwiches, wings, pulled pork, soups and wraps.  Everything is just blah.  Not worth the money and the service is hard to come by.  We are really disappointed in this place and will go elsewhere in the future.  It is truly a shame that this place just keeps going downhill.  Toby, do something about it!  You lost a big fan.",

Typical bar food, good variety and the kitchen was fairly quick in getting me my order. I've done the cheeseburger, club and wings, all of which were fine. No Food Channel awards, but it was satisfying and the portions were decent.  The Service Table service is a pain point for this place. Every time I've visited, it seems they were shorthand on wait staff. Be prepared to wait if you go there and want table service. I now go to the bar when I visit. The service I've received from the Bartenders is excellent, be it for food or drinks.  The Atmosphere. Good layout, lots of TVs and seating. Audio on sporting events is muted in favor of country music. This was kinda annoying, being it was hockey and basketball playoff season. I then came to grips, realizing this place has Toby's name on the door and country music is king here.  I'll go back if I stay at Harrahs, as its really convenient and you can usually grab a seat at the bar.",

The \"free\" cornbread was stale and dry, worth every cent it cost. The butter was good but limited.  The bartender recommend the fried mac and cheese which I love but these things were near tennis ball size and tasted horrible, not recommended.  I had to ask for another drink twice and it wasn't even busy.  The strange thing is the butter that came with the corn on the cob was hard and tasteless, not sure why they didn't use the same butter they had with the cornbread is beyond me, at least that was good.

The batter on the Chicken was light and yet still crunchy and the fry's were great and plenty of them.   We went back for dinner before heading to the Airport on Sunday evening after a long weekend. Once again the food was fresh and plentiful and the place was packed. I would go to another the next time I see this chain.",

The food was really delicious! My friends and I split the Big Boy sampler platter and the Getcha Some fajitas.   The sampler had a lot of really tasty variety, there were cheesy mozzarella sticks, mac and cheese balls, meatloaf potato skins and saucy chicken wings. So comfy and good! This platter came with a special yummy ranch and gravy, which we were confused about at first, but found that it was to die for with the mac and cheese balls. Perfection!  For a little drinky drink, the Toadsuck Pond is super yummy! Go try it!",

Large and lively, waitresses dressed in chaps, you got a sense of the Southwest feel here.  Huge mason jars of water or soda, I saw a table nearby with nachos. I had asked the waiter if it was a half or full order, and he said half. It was HUGE! And it was only $8! I was set on that, and a friend also ordered their fried mac and cheese balls. Was excited to try it!  The fried mac and cheese ball was dissapointing. Flavorless, even with their spicy ranch sauce.  When our entrees came out, they were HUGE! No one could finish their food! My nachos were really good, was quite surprised, and we could barely put a dent in it. Their french fries, although could be cooked a little longer, were really tasty as well.  All in all, a good cheap meal, and we left just as the live band started rocking out. A p plus is using your Total Rewards card for a discount as well.",

    "text": "I had eaten here once a while back and enjoyed it a lot. Yelpers Bobby K. and Anna from VA came into town and suggested this place for dinner. It's located inside Harrah's and coming in from the parking garage it's going to be hard to miss since it's right there on the left and country music can be heard coming from inside the restaurant. Bobby had seats for us already so there was no wait time. Our server was friendly and took great care of us. They have TVs all over playing music videos and while most of it was obviously country music, they did play some Metallica and Pearl Jam LOL. Our table was lost in awesome conversation until we noticed my wife stuck on one of the TVs. They played 3 Luke Bryan videos back to back so we lost her for a bit. They have a bar you can sit at if you don't want to sit at a table or booth.  I had a Fried Mac and Cheese ball that was average. I was craving a burger so I looked over the menu to see what sounded good. I went with the Hottie Burger. The burger came with a hot link on it as well fried onions, lettuce, tomato and pepper jack cheese. The burger was cooked to my liking and tasted really good. The only complaint is that it was spicy at all. Not even a hint of heat. For a burger with a name \"Hottie\" in it you'd expect it to have a kick. While the burger was very good.... I would suggest they add some fried jalapenos in place of the fried onions. My wife had the Hottie Wrap and felt the same way. She said it tasted great and the amount of guacamole and other stuff inside her wrap was great but the chicken had no heat at all. The Fried Bologna sandwich yelper Anna got was effing interesting. I left stuffed. That's all.",

I came here while the National Finals Rodeo was in town and the clientele here couldn't have been more suited for this type of establishment. There were cowboy hats and Lucchese boots everywhere. For starters, a must try are the fried mac 'n' cheese balls. Macaroni and cheese formed into balls, breaded and fried, served with a side of cheese dipping sauce. It's not something found many places but definitely a must try. Otherwise, they offer a good variety of burgers and sandwiches. The fries were great, as was the service - fast and friendly. The only downside to this place is having to walk through one of the older, smokier casinos on the strip to eat here.  If you're staying anywhere on the strip, you're not too far from a great meal here.  A definite must try.",

Being from Texas, I am of the biggest country fan but I do love to 2 step so I enjoyed myself.   There was a pretty sad crowd in the bar, which was off for midnight on a Saturday... Be sure you are going with a group of your own, or else you may be a bit bored.  The icing on the cake is when I got to dance the Cotton Eyed Joe. For those that don't know this song (not the 90s dance version but the real version) it is played at a southern wedding and brought back great memories.",

Couldn't get a cocktail re-fill, damn near couldn't get a cocktail to begin with. Staff never checked how the food was,, couldn't get their attention. Took a long time to get served after we finally got up and walked around and flagged an employee. Place was empty mind ya,, horrible attitude.  One bartender hacking, wheezing, sniffing, sneezing and blowing his nose with his fingers, then washing the snot off in the glass wash basin,, handling most everyone's else's food and drinks. No employee gave a damn what they were doing. Inhuman.  Filthy bar and dining room. Garbage everywhere. No comp drinks for video poker. Poker machine quit working and when we finally got an employees attention it was \"Ahhhhh I dunno what to do\",, and we got no help at all.  Expensive and tourist shitty.

I wish the casino was like this!  Of course I corrected the mistake.  I didn't order any food because it was 1am or so.  I did see the clientele at this time of night, and I must say it is nothing but older rednecks. I am from Texas...but come on.  Too many old rednecks.  They have their own dancing and mating rituals which I am still not accustomed.    The main problem with the place is the location.  It is upstairs in a cubby hole.  Difficult to find and just strange.  I do not understand who thought the location was a good idea.  I believe the decision to place the bar in this area went like this:  Harrah's Executive #1: \"So...what do we put in this isolated 'dungeon-like' place?\" Harrah's Executive #2: \"How about a redneck bar?\" Harrah's Executive #1: \"What exactly is a redneck bar?\" Harrah's Executive #2: \"A bar that attracts rednecks.\" Harrah's Executive #1: \"So how do we attract rednecks?\" Harrah's Executive #2: \"Get a country singer that likes guns and sings like crap to scribble his name all over it and put some cheesy crap that he touched throughout the place.\" Harrah's Executive #1: \"So....Toby Keith?\" Harrah's Executive #2: \"Bingo!\"",

So we HAD to see her favorite (Toby Keith's) bar at Harrah's. My expectations for Harrah's wasn't high at all, and it met those expectations.  \"I Love This Bar\" was basically the Hard Rock Cafe for Country meets Coyote Ugly. The place was loaded with Toby's records and hats and shirts he wore at certain events. The staff was sexy delicious. The outfits were as follows: cowboy hat, little black shirt that reads \"HOTTIE\", black booty panties, and black assless leather chaps. Possibly the greatest work uniform of all time? I think so.  The food was just ok. I got a western burger and it was gigantic. The fries were \"crusty\" and meh. Toby's \"I Love This Bar\" song and video came on and they announced free shots - so I ran over to the bar where the bartenders dump it straight from bottle inti to your mouth. Not a spritz either, like fill your mouth from throat to lips. Savage style. I kinda like it. Just because Mom had to try it - we got the Deep Fried Twinkie for dessert. When in Rome...  All in all, a cool place to drink and fantasize about your server. Food was pretty decent. I've got a new respect for TK. Definitely a cooler spot than Sammy Hagar's or Vince Neil's. And I'm not even a Country fan.  4.25 stars. But why no mechanical bull? You'd think it's a no brainer.",

It's too small to be a club.....about 1/2 the size of Gilley's.    The food here is OK bar food.  Our friends ordered some Wings and I sampled a few....they weren't bad, just OK.  Same goes for the Fries.  Since I didn't pay, I didn't catch the price.  The waitresses are supposed to be cute/hot....but only 1/2 of them were.  The others looked a little \"sloppy\".  I hate saying that, but if you're going to put your staff in sexy outfits, I'd make sure they are able to meet high standards....especially in Vegas.  Overall, the food/experience was just OK.  The best part is the music.  The joint feels very 'touristy'.  I'd give it another chance under the right circumstances.  Return Factor - 50%",

    "text": "I'm not a country western fan and I don't know who Toby Keith is other than someone my girlfriend was drooling over. But I do know that country-western people know how to eat, so I was all up for visiting this bar/grill while we visited Vegas.   It's inside Harrahs on the strip.  It didn't open until 11 which was a bit annoying, considering how hungry I was at 10 am, but eventually it did. Like many chains, there is a feeling of \"same old same old\" the moment you walk in, just like any Jimmy Buffet Margaritavilles or a Applebees.   There was lot of country music and videos on the TV, mostly Toby Keith, and there are bra's hanging around the bar. A country western bar for sure! There is a stage for live music. The cool thing to do is order your beer in a giant mason jar (just Coors for the mason jar only). I hate Coors but I figured when in Rome....  The next day we popped by once again so she could get some souvenirs from the gift shop and pose with the cut-out photo of Toby. We did order up some chili fries and they were delicious which confirms my theory that the food here must be pretty good, in a chain kind of way. Hot and fresh and plentiful. Overall it lacks an original feeling. But I do plan to hit one up in Phoenix next time, so it did its job, but I'll avoid the Coors. Yuck.",

    "text": "The worst meal I had in Vegas.  That's disappointing because I like Toby Keith. But I can unequivocally say, I hate this bar.  We had been out all day sightseeing and we needed a decent supper before bed. Harrah's has a bar that is themed after a Toby Keith song. I love this bar. So it looked kind of slow but there were folks eating at several tables. We have eaten at several of the restaurants  in the casino and they've been good. We got seated as we walked up and the waiter came and took our order. Hot wings for her and Fish and chips for me. When they brought her wings they left off the ranch. My order was complete but not completely fried. The breading on the cod fish was not crisp. It was soggy and a little runny on the inside. I took a bite and it was super hot temp wise. But the whole thing fell apart like it had been dunked in water. All of the fish were like this. The fries and slaw were good. As far as the wings went. They were still partly frozen. I grabbed the tip of the wing on one and it was literally cold to the touch. After spending the day in death valley, I'm very aware what hot vs. cold is. This was poor execution of what should be a simple fried order.  One more thing. The sweet tea was way too sweet. Don't get me wrong,  I love sweet tea. I'm a southern guy and I've had sweet tea since I was 3 probably. I like it sweet. But not this sweet. Maybe you shouldn't even try to be southern, Vegas.",

    "text": "When reading this review please note the song titles in the brackets.  So if you've followed me here on Yelp, you will have noticed that I have been to Sammy Hagar's Cabo Wabo and Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville. Today, January 20, 2017 I let my wife decide when we went for lunch. It was time our little lunch adventures had [A Woman's Touch].She decided we should go to this one place inside Harrah's casino. Now, we don't exactly live in the [Trailerhood] but we traveled from Northwest Las Vegas, down to the Strip and finally placed a check mark here. When we got to Harrah's it felt like we have to walk [Upstairs Downtown] and all around the casino, but we made it. When we got there, I thought to myself, \"That's  The Next Thing On [My List].  So when we walked in, I didn't see a  [Humingbird] I didn't even hear a staff member say [Who's That Man?] Guess I am not that famous yet. But I did notice the female staff wearing chaps and bikini-like shorts. No, I didn't say [Who's You Daddy?] but I did wonder if this place would be appropriate for children.  We were seated immediately. We looked around talking about the decor and all the television screens, my wife never had a chance to say [I Wanna Talk About Me.] Instead our waitress came by asking us what we would like to drink. My wife is not a [Whisky Girl] instead she ordered an iced tea. I ordered a soda. Our drinks were not served in a [Red Solo Cup] but instead they were served in large mason jars, which I liked.  When reading the menu, it's pretty basic. You won't need a degree from [Honkytonk U] to understand it. It's basically barbecue, hamburgers and that sort of thing.  My wife ordered what was called [American Soldier] Burger 100% all-beef grilled burger topped with your choice of cheddar, swiss, american or pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion. The wife chose American cheese.   I did not order [Beer For My Horses] and I had no need to [Get Drunk And Be Somebody.] What I did order was \"Old West\" Burger 100% all-beef grilled burger topped with cheddar cheese and crisp bacon then smothered in Toby's barbecue sauce topped with beer-battered onion rings.  This is my kind of hamburger, it almost had me [Dream Walkin'] After eating this hamburger I wanted to say [I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying.] But instead I told my wife I liked my hamburger, I asked how she liked her's and she said, [Me Too].  The French fries we were served were my favorite part. When you go here, make sure you [Getcha Some].  Maybe I [Should've Been A Cowboy] but alas I am a father with two daughters, and I think my daughters would like this place for lunch. But, [It's A Little Too Late], due to the outfits worn, and the restaurant not having a kid's menu, that fifth star, well... [He Ain't Worth Missing.]  As I finish this review, the food here is better than the previously mentioned places. The price, is good for tourists. But I must ask one question...  [How Do You Like Me Now?]",

We started with an appetizer, the chicken wings, and tried the barbecue and the Cajun style which is served with french fries. The wings were delicious slightly larger than your average wings and full of flavor. Both sauces, barbecue and Cajun were full of flavor  As the main course we split a full order of St. Louis ribs. I found the ribs to be slightly on the Fatty side and a bit undercooked. They didn't really fall off the bone. And they seemed a little bit too sassy for my taste. I should have probably ordered a burger which I saw in passing and looked pretty delicious.  The service was amazing. The server was very attentive.

Ok.. so took 30 minutes to get my food, so hooray comps. So I snagged desert and left a good tip since I have no cash on me. Also... The hot links tasted like mildly spicy polish sausages. Annnnnd apparently I must be black because of my opinion on the hotlinks, I heard this as being passed on from one of my waitresses coworkers. I brought this concern to the manager a Jerry O'Brien and he offered me his card and that my next meal there is on him. That is, if I ever return.  The one brought spot here was my waitress Dana, she did everything possible to give me a good experience. Every restaurant could use 5 people like Dana at minimum.  Two stars only because of my waitress Dana.",

The ladies wear chaps with bare butts, and my uncle said to our waitress, \"I like your pants.\"  She was super nice about it, and she was a great waitress.   The burgers are pretty pricey - the cheapest was like $16, but the order does come with fries, cole slaw, or potato salad.  We all asked for our burger temperatures to be medium or medium rare, but they all came out well done.  The burgers had good flavors, and we were starving, so we just ate it.    They only play Toby Keith songs, so be prepared if you are not a Toby Keith fan or a country fan in general.    While I was there, they did not play his song, I Love This Bar - that would have made my day.",

    "text": "The food is awesome.  The service is lacking.  Let me explain. When your waitress takes your order, and you order appetizers, there is a good chance your main course will arrive with, or even before, your appetizer.  It's not the fault of the waitress, she always asks if we wanted the appetizer first, then the main course.  The problem is the process in which your food is delivered to your table.  Your waitress doesn't deliver, your food is delivered by other staff.  I'm quite sure the waitress and the cooks are on the same page, but the food delivery people don't seem to be in on the communication chain.   All that said, just order appetizers first, and order your main dish AFTER you receive your appetizer or when you're ready.   Great tip: Wednesday is .25 cent wing night, and Thursday is $6 steak night.  Great value!",

Hot waitresses in crotchless and a$$less chaps (wearing skintight thick panties, not naked of course!), country hit music, great bbq, and American-proud decor as far as the eye can see. What's not to like?   We had the sampler platter and meatloaf. My friend that got the meatloaf didn't like it (said it was dry and cold) but the sampler platters were great. Ribs, pulled pork sliders, wings, and sausage. A meatatarian (patent pending) dream, the American way.   Midway through out meal a band came on stage ND started playing covers of hit country songs. To my surprise they were quite good! They even did a cool blend (I'm a real DJ so I don't call things \"mashups\" like pop society, and am kind of mad at Glee for starting the wrong use of this term) of margaritaville to sweet child of mine back to margaritaville again that actually worked well.   We actually stayed about an hour longer than we planned because the music was good.   The decor is outstanding. The entry doors are garage doors completely with garage door openers. Giant guitars overhead. America everywhere you look. The menu has lots of country references too. For instance the burgers come with a side order and one of the options is \"freedom fries\". Haha. 'Murica!   No matter how cliche it is, I have to say it... I love this bar!",

Great bands at 9pm every night and good bartenders. They do that flair crap but we can wait the extra minute for our drinks. Oh yes, the drinks... They have a good list of specialty drink like \"Whiskey Girl\" and \"Pondskipper\" or whatever that are GREAT and they serve them in Mason Jars. They are a bit pricey at $18 but you will only need one. You can get any drink or beer in the Mason Jars.   They do play nothing but country music. How bad is that really? It's not like it's Hip Hop, still a lot of people won't come here. To them we say; just realize that you aren't as cool as you think you are so just fucking go and have a good time. This is another tourist trap and a hell of a good one too. The people-watching is top notch and people will actually talk your ear off. As you know, we like tourist traps, maybe because we like being a tourist... Fuck we wish we were somewhere being tourists right now. Oh boo hoo, suppose we'll have to be satisfied with places like Toby Keith's.",

If you are looking for cheaper prices and a True Toby feel you should try the locations he does own in Oklahoma.  I was told it would be about a 10 minute wait and they have some tables and chairs to sit and have a drink or just hang out while you wait to be seated.   I ordered the \"Fried Chicken Salad\" and it was fantastic. It is so huge you can eat off it for 5 days! The ranch dressing was thick and delicious.  I loved the country music playing and how other customers all sang along with the music together. When \"Red Solo Cup\" played everybody was singing and having a great time. They have many drink specials and for beer lovers they have special sizes just for you! With a players card I was able to get a discount off of my bill. If you want a good time this place is a must try!",

    "text": "What is there to love about Toby Keith's Bar & Grill? Not a whole lot.  My family and I had dinner at TK's last night as an alternative to Guy Fieri's who 1. Doesn't take reservations and 2. Wanted us to wait 2 hours to eat. Ha ha! No thanks Guy. And BTW - no reservations? Come on.  First TK's has a fun atmosphere, but looks like a normal 'ol bar and grill. The walls are decorated with Toby Keith... things, and all the girls wear panties and chaps. Ass in your face every time your server leaves your table. Speaking of service, it could be improved. After we were seated we waited a good 10 minutes to put our order in, luckily, since we all had sufficient time we all knew what we wanted to eat and drink.  Onward to the food - steak fajitas, which came out sizzling and made me excited. But when were placed in front of me were a let down. The beef was haphazardly cut and chunky, not strips. Plus the meat was not seasoned in anyway and it looked just WRONG to me. Fajitas come with your choice of corn or flour tortillas. I picked corn - half of them were not steamed enough and had hard edges. They brought them out in a tortilla holder with NO LID. What the heck? No wonder it did not steam all the way. Dear manager of TK's: put lids on your tortilla holders and customers will get tortillas that are soft! My fajitas also came with: rice (OK), refried beans (OK), salsa (not spicy at all), guac (OK), and sour scream (OK). Overall what could be a great dish, only mediocre.  Next - \"I Love This Bar\" BBQ Sandwich - my mother requested no sides for her sandwich, but they brought her fries anyway. She said the BBQ sandwhich could use more BBQ sauce.   Chicken Fried Steak - My brother had this and said it was so-so, not a REAL chicken fried steak in my family's opinion because it didn't appear to be pan-fried, which is the honest way to make a chicken fried steak - not deep frying it with a lot of breading. Speaking of breading...  My husband's fish and chips were mostly breading which he peeled off so he could actually eat the fish.  Lastly, the shrimp appetizer which my father ordered for his meal came with a HUGE amount of deep fried little shrimp. There had to have been 20 and it came with a tasty, creamy cajun-flavored dipping sauce. I really liked the shrimp.  Overall - I feel as though there could be a lot of improvement. I like Toby Keith. I like the idea of the restaurant - I really like all the country music they were playing, but the food was a huge downer.",

Everyone was digging out cash or feeling uncomfortable to put it on their card.  They had live music playing which we enjoyed, and even a small dance floor for some to go out to.  Overall it was an inconsistent experience with some high points and low points.",

Only reason I went was because of a colleague wanting to desperately to go to it.   Location: The Bar and Grill is located in the dark depths of Harrahs. For Vegas, this is an indicator for a bottom tier restaurant. The patrons attracted to this locale are often those that are above mid 40s, Harrahs itself is like a retirement community so it comes off as no surprise.   Menu: The food menu consists of anything but save a few healthy options, salads are the only choice. Other than the salads, you can tell in the quality and portions of food why obesity runs rampant in America. The food is everything that can almost be thought of when you think of a southern dive bar.   Beverages: The choices of beverage is limited in beer, but the cocktails make up what is lacking in the frothy pours. Cocktails are a little new concoction and a little twisted oldies. Depending on the bartender, the bar can make drinks to ones specification.",

Sampled their appetizers of quesadillas, chicken strips and whisky girl wings with bread pudding for dessert. A fan of the strips and wings and the bread pudding was tasty but too sweet with the sauce and whipped cream. The wings were huge and had just enough of sauce and heat. The breading on the strips made the dish and the chicken was nice and moist. Will return here for more appies in the future.",

The place is nice and good for couples, families and groups... definitely not for business or romance as the place is noisy in general and every evening you have live country music which is a nice plus (the group was pretty good as well and offered a nice selection of songs). If you like to dance, you can enjoy yourself right under the stage even if you don't have a partner.  Food was good and I definitely enjoyed my ribs, although a little bit too much on the sweet side for my tastes (I prefer them to be heavily smoked). Conisidering the kind of place I'd have liked a wider choice of draft beers.  The place is a little bit pricey for what it offers, but it's Vegas so it's expected.",

    "text": "We came here for dinner twice on our trip since it was right in our hotel.  The first time the food and the service were amazing - if based solely on that experience this would've been a 5 star review - but the second time we came in the service was awful and the food was just as bad - so if based on that this would be a 1 star review!  The first trip - the staff were great and always around.  They were quick and everything came out right.  The fried mac & cheese comes out in an amazing beer batter - these were the best I've ever had.  The bbq burger I had was massive and cooked just right.  They have some of the best french fries.  The guest I was with had the chili burger without the bread - good thing there was no way you could pick that up and eat it!  2 burgers,  2 regular drinks and an app for just over $30 not bad at all!  The second trip - it was later in the night and they weren't crazy busy but we waited over 20 minutes even though there were some open tables.  Then we waited quite some time for our waitress.  We gave our order and waited - the mac & cheese was just as good.  The burgers however were bad... I asked for mine medium well (should have been just past pink) - it was like a hockey puck.  My guest asked for hers medium and got one just past medium well.  We couldn't catch our waitress for over 10 minutes after our meals came out at which point there was no way we were waiting for them recook them.  They did make this right and take one of them off our bill... but at this point the dinner was ruined.  They do take off $1-$2 off each item if you have a total rewards card.  This place is extremely loud at night due to the live music and dancing - it is a bar after all so don't expect less.  I have also been in here on crazy nights when bras are hanging from the bar - so I wouldn't recommend bringing kids in here at night!",

    "text": "We stepped into the Toby Keith Bar this evening at 12:30a, the website did show that it's business hours lasted until 2a; and received by far the WORST customer experience to date.  We purchased cocktails and within 10 minutes they turned off the music and turned the lights on to begin closing.  We asked if they were closing early, explained we thought they were staying open until 2a, and the bartender stated, and I quote \"That's what you get for looking at the website! Ya, we're closing. Business is slow so we're done.\"  All of this was communicated in the most condescending voice/communication that we did not expect from this establishment. We mentioned our frustration with their communication - none of this aggression and condescending tones were necessary.  This was followed up with a bartender/bar back yelling across the bar 'If you have a problem with me, get back here and take it up with me'.  The aggression and complete lack of customer service was over the top and completely unnecessary.  We would have happily come back the next night, this being our first visit, until your staff aggressively taunted our party and rudely pushed all of their customers out of the door.  This experience has left a sour taste in our mouth and a disappointing/disrespectful view of this establishments brand. Very disappointed, and all from the managing staff representing your business. I do hope the Sr Mgt reaches out to rectify this issue. Until then, I highly suggest avoiding this venue unless these actions are what you seek when visiting the Toby Keith Bar and grill.",

We were so happy about getting out of there with our wallets intact that we were giddy to eat here. The bartender said that most of his customers came in straight from the timeshare pitch to get hammered and complain about being suckers.  On the minus side, the food is for suckers. It's overpriced, although a Total Rewards card knocks off a dollar or two, and it's not that good.  On the plus side, the mason-jar sized drink got my wife drunk enough to be very entertaining, but not so drunk that she hit the point of diminishing returns. So the bartender gets props for hitting the sweet spot.",

The servers are nice and friendly and we never have to wait to be seated. I tried the chicken wrap on one of our times there and was disappointed in what they charge to put a processed chicken finger in a wrap. I love their version of the ruben by only complaint is the meat is a little dry. My all time favorite is their fried twinkie, it melts in your mouth!! The fried pickles are also amazing the best way to start your meal. My husband was not crazy about their steak sandwich said it was a little tough, but the time before he had their fried fish and said it was amazing. I guess my review of this place is mixed they have some good menu items, but for the price i would eat elsewhere if i didn't have  a groupon. Service is great and friendly.",

A large screen playing music videos and some smaller ones all around with both tunes and NASCAR, will be the background noise to your dining experieince.  Loves it!  I first saw one of these places while driving through Nashville and have been wanting to eat here ever since!  The girls working are in chaps and the eye candy was excellent! Our server was Rhonda and she did a fantastic job. Totally on top of it and delivered great service through the whole meal. I ordered a house salad ($11.99) and when it arrived I could tell it would feed me another meal or two, so I asked for a to-go container before dressing it. She brought me one (which I filled with salad) and even brought me a lid for the extra dressing. They must get this a lot! The two cups of dressing were huge!  My husband had some sort of big club sandwich that he enjoyed ($15.99). We both had a drink and enjoyed the large mason jars - you don't have to check on a table as often because it takes longer to empty a drink (not sure why some places use such small glasses). With our check, Rhonda brought to-go cups as well and made sure our glasses were full.  When you're paying $3.50 for each glass this makes you feel a little better about it.  That's expensive beveraging!! Service was superior to most places of similar value. And it wasn't just her, we saw lots of hard-working employees and bussers. Everyone doing their job well and providing a pleasant dining atmosphere.   Sign up for a player's card! Your Total Rewards card from Flamingo works in the Harrah's Hotel where this Grill is. We didn't realize this and so we missed out on a couple of dollars savings from each meal. Bummer! They must be sister hotels - wish I'd known that it worked at more than one! It was too late by the time we figured this out.  ($37.81 for lunch)",

The food was TERRIBLE. My friend got chicken strips that weren't even cookied and I got this buffalo chicken wrap that was not even edible. Which coming from me NEVER happens especially when I am paying $14 for the item but it literally tasted like Vinegar wrapped in a sundried tomato tortilla. The hotsauce and the Guacamole and chicken was just non existent in the flavoring and I literally had to dip the darn thing in Queso just to be able to eat half of it . Which I only did because ...You guessed it.. the thing cost $14. We had initially been downtown and decided to check this place out because they had a veterans day special for a free burger which my boyfriend took advantage of and for being a free burger he was able to eat it but the fact of the matter is. Even Checkers does it better!  I really enjoy Toby Keith's music and I like the atmosphere with the pretty ladies in their backless chaps but we didn't even end up with a hot waitress and the music was so loud that was playing I couldn't even complain to our waitress if I wanted to but I just couldn't even stomach the energy after how bad everything was. I will hopefully be uploading some photos to cement the fact you shouldn't bother with this place but it's me and I am not always that good at attention to detail. This would have to be one of the first places I have not been able to finish my food though. I am the queen of eating pretty much anything but this place failed hardcore. The chips and Queso was definitely from a Can but that at least tasted good just wasn't worth the $... Definitely try somewhere else if you have the chance!",

We wanted dessert but since the food took almost a half hour to come out, we asked the bartender for a Pecan Pie to go while we were eating so that we wouldn't miss the show. We get the bill and the bartender tacked on a \"to go\" charge for the Pecan Pie. Now, don't get me wrong- I'm from NY and used to charges like plate sharing etc where usually the waiter informs us that we should order something small instead of being charged the $5 or $6 sharing fee. But we sat and ate our dinner and now you are charging me a \"to go\" fee that is half the cost of the food item I ordered. Hmm. Just doesn't make sense. If I order the pie and then just asked for a box, it wouldn't have been more...so why not just suggest that? I asked the bartender about the fee and he said he couldn't take it off because we asked for it \"to go\" even though we sat there. It wasn't the fee that bothered me so much, it was the principle. And just like you are there to make money, I'm there to spend money- but not on a restaurant that charges me to put my pie in a box after I ate at their establishment. I'm a former waiter and restaurant manager btw- so things like this tick me off.",

I'd heard about it from friends who loved it and I sure loved it too. The bar is very big with lots of tables and a dancing area to dance to the live band. I didn't get any food since we all just wanted to get drinks. The staff was friendly and served quickly. The music is loud and the drinks are strong! They're a little expensive but I guess it makes sense since they're served in huge mason jars. Seriously they're huge and really heavy and I'm not complaining. I got a long island for $30 in a big mason jar and it's totally worth it.  We stayed for quite a while dancing until a little after the band took a break. This place has a great vibe and an awesome atmosphere. I'll definitely be returning when I come back to visit.",

JJ is a bartender there, she's a doll and very nice. The crowd starts coming in a little later, let's say after 10. I always have a great time when I go. I was just there with my friends in January, 2017. Im definitely coming back.",

Tender, flavorful, and generous portions. The rest of the menu was average bar foods with a county theme. We will be back for these tacos next time we're in Vegas",

The fried pickles were soggy and the burger we ordered medium came out completely red and under cooked.  The only thing we ate that was worth mentioning would be the mac n cheese balls.  Also, all of our adult beverages had a funny taste (like soap) to them.  Overall a very weird and disappointing experience, will not be back.",

Being a group of service members scattered throughout the US and knowing how well they cater to military members, we thought it was going to be an awesome experience. Upon arrival there was barely anyone inside and were told there was no seating left for the day with or without reservations. The lady at the front desk was very rude and we finally just left. Overall ruined the experience and not looking forward to eating there again",

    "text": "My first time ever coming here and it was surprisingly for a memorial. There were 50 of us and understandably trying to get us all together was hard, they set up 2 long tables side by side for us. Our menu was already picked out for us. We received an appetizer plate with chicken wings, onion rings and jalapeno poppers. I only tried the onion rings which were so good I think they might have been beer battered but not 100% sure. I also tried the chicken wings and when they say chicken wings they mean chicken wings, they are not the little wings you would expect when ordering chicken wings they are the real deal and the buffalo sauce was on the side. Everyone loved the jalapeno poppers that's why I didn't get any. Their sweet tea was a little to sweet for me, I had to order a regular. For my main course I had the chicken salad, my plate was huge full of lettuce cucumbers, carrots, celery and maybe 3-4 small chicken strips on top. Don't get me wrong I thought it was good I just wish there was more chicken. My husband had ribs and my daughter had a steak and their portion was no where near mine. The moment I was waiting for the fried Twinkie! I have been wanting to try one of these for a while now, and I thought it was yummy. The service was great, especially for us being such a big party. One of my brothers food didn't come out with the rest of our and the server went back to fix the problem the manager came over and was talking to my brother and comped a free beer for the wait. I definitely want to go back when I can look at the menu and try whatever I want because the sample I had was great. I definitely recommend trying this place.",

And America and the restaurant itself is all about \"red, white and blue\" Maybe the powers that be will read this and this restaurant will take a little better care of our military.

Come here pretty much every time I visit Vegas and stay at Harrah's cause I like the proximity and the atmosphere. Best thing about this bar is the menu: Southern Food.  The menu is varied but I get the same thing almost everytime, a fried bologna sandwich, or as I like to call it: Welfare steak. a big ole slice of bologna with fried onions and cheese on toasted bread. Comes with either fries or tater salad. Where I come from, we put mustard in the tater salad but Tobey don't so I'm not crazy about it. It's ok, just not great.  The wife likes to order side dishes like fried okra, pickles, mac n cheese balls, and meatloaf. This time, along with a couple of sides, she ordered the Chicken n Dumplings soup. First time she ordered this and wasn't crazy about it. She said it didn't have enough dumplings in it.  I have no idea why she ordered this. She makes the best chicken n dumplings I ever tasted which is why I never order any anywhere.  Ok, usual complaint but not really complaining. The price is a little high but remember, this is Vegas 2016. You're not paying $3.99 for prime rib like back in the Rat Pack days. Any other city I would never pay $13 bucks for a bologna sandwich but you're here so don't complain and enjoy.  (Come to think about it, where else you going to get a fried bologna sandwich other than Dollywood?)  Live music and live crowds, free shots at the bar when the bell rings, and lot's of fun.",

The cover band was actually pretty good on a Saturday night, the only negative was once we started enjoying ourselves after dinner listening to the band next to the dance floor we were told we had to give up our table.  By that time the place was standing room only so we didn't bother sticking around.",

But I have never eaten here before this summer. I came in just before lunch on a weekday and it wasn't busy. I grabbed a seat at the bar with intentions of gambling while I ate. I also watched part of a baseball game next to a gent wearing some Giants gear.  I ordered the buffalo wings, extra crispy but they weren't that crispy. The sauce was pretty good though. I did stick with a water as I didn't get back to my room until 4 or so in the morning. And how appropriate that it was served in a Red Solo Cup. (\"Let's have a party!) The bartenders were entertaining and very casual. They also had a huge projector screen in the back and country music playing. Not just by Toby either so that was nice. I love me some country music so I was A-OK with the entertainment. I'd come back.",

We closed this place down and still wanted more, if you are looking for some good country fun in Vegas this is the ONLY stop.",

The ambience was great, and it reminded me of home (I grew up on a ranch in Northern California).  Also they have a giant screen playing country music videos and we were all singing a long when we were here.    Overall, a fun place to catch dinner!",

I actually prefer to come here during the day because most of the bartenders are really personable and you get a really cool show while they throw bottles around and pour 20 shots at a time in a pyramid. They are able to talk with you moer and spend more time showing off their cool tricks than they are at night when it is super busy. AND they still play the Toby Keith song, \"I Love This Bar\" during the day- which means free shots!   I keep coming back to this place despite the fact that I am not that big into country music and I absolutely despise Toby Keith. So, that really says something about how fun this bar is!  Last note, go on your birthday and order the birthday shot. Trust me :)",

    "text": "This place should seriously just be called Toby Keith Bar. We went there tonight with a very large group of people, families, but the kids were aged between 14 and 20. We dropped down a combined $800 to $1000 on food and drinks. The food was just ok, I ordered the pulled pork which tasted ok but was a bit soggy. We were got there at about 9 pm and ate and then were just hanging out listening to the music and dancing. All of a sudden we are informed but a security gard that the dance floor is part of the bar, even though it is in the restaurant, and that our teenage girls had to get off the dance floor. Keep in mind they are all real dancers and not drunks staggering around with a beer in their hand and it is hard for them to hear music and not be compelled to do what they do best.   Anyway in the end after complaining that we did not think a restaurant that allowed families should have this sort of policy banning their customers from dancing, we were basically escorted out of the restaurant by the security as the manager didn't want to deal with our argument. Punch line to this story. Toby Keith's is not a Grill but a Bar with food (bar food) and if you have kids well they will take you hard earned money but they really don't want you there, best to not go!",

So for some reason I have been here a few times, and each time I really thought the food was less than desirable. This time was a little different.   The food is quite pricey for what it is. Yeah, you get a dollar off if you use your Total Rewards card, but really - it's still kind of expensive for just ok food. I got the chicken wrap last time and it was utterly inedible. I definitely won't get that ever again. Lots of wrap, not a lot of chicken.  This time, we ordered the fried macaroni and cheese and the brisket nachos. Let me say, I was pleasantly surprised. The mac and cheese balls were lightly battered and fried just crispy enough. The nachos - were heaping and the brisket was very good. good choices this time.  Next - the beer - so there isn't a great selection of draft beer - but the bonus is how large a draft beer is. I believe they are 22oz for $10. Which isn't bad. And of course you can take it to go in a plastic cup. (But don't try and bring your outside drink into TK's)  If you're with a lot of friends, a beer tower is definitely the way to go...   Minuses - the whole bar area didn't have a server. So all the tables in the bar area hadn't been bussed and it was a total mess. It's not really a problem to order the food through the bar,  but just means getting up and down if you need other things. The bartender was friendly and helpful, but then you wonder what you're tipping for when you are getting up and down... but oh well.",

Our waitress barely checked in on us. The menu has a small variety of options. The quality of food is not worth the price. I ordered a \"she's a hottie\" chicken wrap and it was SO disappointing. It was so bland. It was supposed to have the chicken dipped in hotwing sauce but it tasted so bland. I was upset. The fries have no flavor to them.  The only plus to this place is the live entertainment. That's it. I will not be coming back to this restaurant again.   P.S if you want a side of ranch it's $1.00... Stupid economy.",

I sent back my blue cheese burger and my husband barely ate any of his country fried steak. It was grisley and hard to chew, even the mashed potatoes tasted like they were sitting around all day. The only reason he didn't send his back too is because he worried they would think we were just trying to get out of the bill. I don't know if it's a new chef or new management or new supplier, but if that's the norm they will be shut down soon.",

I'm giving this establishment a 2 for the great music, decor, & the hostess.  3 out of 4 of us enjoyed our food. We had the mac & cheese balls appetizers, they were so bland kraft mac & cheese has more flavor. For dinner, my son ordered the American Soldier, his friend ordered the cat fish, my boyfriend ordered the chicken fried steak, & I ordered the western burger. The burgers looked & smelled great but were so bland & tasteless, not even adding ketchup, salt & pepper could save it or even give it flavor. I think McDonald's is horrible & even then a big Mac has more flavor. The chicken fried steak was also bland & tasteless, where again salt & pepper could not save.",

I loved it so much I dragged all my friends there on this trip to Vegas. This time from the minute we walked in we were very unimpressed. From waiting at the bar for over 10 ten minutes and not being served to being sat by a very unfriendly hostess and waiting another 10 minutes to meet our server.  The food however was great and we loved the size of the drinks (once we finally got them)  I'm not sure if I'd go back again. Maybe it's worth it if you like country music and they have live band but don't go there for the friendly service.",

It took 5 minutes to be acknowledged and seated. And even longer for our waiter to make initial contact with us. I ordered the Cobb salad and was quite surprised when I could barely stab the grilled chicken with my fork. Extremely dry and hard. Not fresh at all. The Mac and cheese was described by the waiter to be \"gourmet\" but it was old and dry. One bite was all it took to not eat the rest. The fried shrimp were very good! The environment was fun with a good live band and a good design energy. The service was overall bad and the food mediocre at best. I wouldn't go back.",

The flavor was great though. My meal came out relatively quick. The steak was okay, the baked potato was okay, but the peel was dry, which might have been caused by the time, it was late. The mac and cheese was not very good. They spent 30 minutes trying to get the charge to go through on my room. I was on hold myself with the hotels front desk. I couldn't leave the restaurant without getting the charge to go through. At first, the band was playing music that was very irritating to me and I was hoping they were finishing soon.  Later on, they started playing some good music and it was actually enjoyable. The overall experience was about a 2 out of 5 stars.",

I had the wings which were soggy and too hard to eat as they were the entire chicken wing (3 sections each).  They were honestly about on par with the frozen wings you get at Sams.  My daughter had the brisket tacos.  She said they were tasteless except for the cilantro on top.  My son had the hamburger with brisket on it and it was pretty tasteless as well. My husband had a hamburger and was not impressed.  Our take was that Toby should stick to singing.  This restaurant is overpriced and the food is below average.  Will not go again.",

Went with a group of 4 and ordered:  App: Full size beef nachos-- This was actually good and we finished it  Entrees: Fried Bologna Sandwich, Ruben Sandwich, and half of a BBQ Chicken.  The Ruben Sandwich had to be sent back right away. It was had more bread than meat. The meat and coleslaw was totally flavorless. The bread was huge Texas Toast that was soaked in butter. This was replaced with a bowl of Tortilla Soup that was edible but still lacking  flavor.  The Fried Bologna Sandwich was pretty much the same as the Ruben. All butter soaked Texas Toast and a slab of fried bologna with no flavor. We did not send this back, but only half was eaten.  Now on tho the BBQ Chicken plate. Can we say RAW chicken? When the BF ripped into this it was dripping blood. There were some small pieces that were cooked but for the most part it was raw and bloody. They tried to say it was because they smoked their chicken. Listen, I know the difference between smoked chicken ( which is pink) and bloody raw chicken. Totally disgusting and not worth going back. The BF was sick all night and serving raw chicken is dangerous!",

We meet our friends at this place and find our friends seated at booth and sit at a table right next to them,  (note there are several empty tables around us) the waitress (Asian female, didn't get her name) completely ignores us and doesn't ask if we'd like to order anything.  When we get tired of being ignored we politely ask if we can \"Order\" a drink and she asks if want water (In a sarcastic tone)!!!  When we say no, we actually want to order a drink that costs MONEY, she asks if the \"maitre D\" sat us there.   I explained the situation above to her and in a snotty way she says she has to go ask the manager if we can be served!! WTF??!!!  So after making us feel like we're F' N beggars in this P.O.S joint, I go up front and ask to speak to the manager, I explain the situation to the sad excuse for a manager and he proceeds to look at me sarcastically and starts to side with this broad!!!  So I explain to him that he is in V-E-G-A-S and that people are coming there to spend their hard earned money and should at least get a little bit of courtesy and respect but he couldn't hear me because obviously the guy doesn't have a clue, as to what customer service is.    Mr. Toby Keith should send this moron SIMS or whatever his name is, to work in the collections department or bathroom because he has NO CLUE as to what SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY OR ANY HOSPITALITY IS!!!!  VEGAS has waaaay to many choices of places to go, I recommend you all go somewhere you'll be treated with RESPECT and are made to feel welcome!!",

The environment was awesome: country music playing with the wild bartenders doing tricks nonstop. Service was good, the waitress was pretty quick and knowledgable with the menu..she made a couple recommendations that turned out to be awesome. The food was top notch!! All 9 of us agreed that the fries were the best we had ever had. I got an old western burger that is up there as one of the top 10 hamburgers I have ever had. Everyone else had great things to say about the food. As for the prices, it's Vegas, of course they are going to be high. This was one of the cheaper dinners we had though, my burger and fries were only $15..I paid 20+ for muuuuch worse throughout the weekend. Looks like it would be a fun place to visit at night with the floor for line dancing and very entertaining bar tenders. I'm sure we will be visiting 'I love this bar' multiple times on our next Vegas trip!!",

Just wasn't anywhere near as good. From our orders we enjoyed the steak and prawns. The ribs that came with the prawns were dry with limited flavor. Of the sides with dinner, the mashed potatoes were good, very good. The rest of the sides which were the macaroni and cheese, coleslaw and potato salad we're just not tasty in anyway, and only a bite or two were taken from each serving. The place was cold and dark (it was tough to read the menu and we had to use the flashlight on our phones to be able to read), service was decent I guess, and our order was screwed up. Just not a good experience and certainly will not be back.",

Unfortunately the ribs were the most expensive and disappointing part of the meal! We shared a huge nacho appetizer and they were good. The server was great.  The second time I was in a group and the food was all average. Nothing stood out and nobody in the group had good things to say when leaving. There was a fair variety of meals ordered from fish and pork to burgers. It was just average chain restaurant food. The server sucked but was wearing assless chaps and underwear. That seems good till she bends over pick up a fork dropped at the table next to you. That is interesting to say the least!   They do have fair priced drinks. They use mason jars for beers and mixed drinks which is pretty cool. My wife once ordered a mason jar mixed drink for around 14 dollars and it was to strong for her. I tried it and it was on the strong side, but I would rather that than the alternative.   All in all, I will not return to this location for dinner, maybe for drinks and appetizers at best...",

Next door to the restaurant is the Toby Keith's gift shop.  It has a great cowboy/country decor, and the staff are all very friendly.  The waitress all wear very skimpy attire.  The menu selection is large, with a good variety of food.  I ordered the Fajitas.  I thought the portion size was small based on the cost.  The chicken did taste very good.  The rice and beans came in a little plastic cup and the portion was extremely small.  The drinks come in mason jars and cost around $20 each (no you don't get to keep the glass).  a little pricey.  It's a loud environment, and gets very loud when the band starts playing.  There is a dance floor and a lot of people were up dancing.  This is a great restaurant to drink and listen to great music, but I think the food takes a back seat to the live entertainment and bar.  Despite that I had a great time, and look forward to returning here again.",

We were told by the hostess ironically named \"Joy\" that we couldn't sit in the booth we had asked very nicely to be sat in after we had already been at the bar for over an hour and spent money on drinks. We were also very rudely told that we could only sit in one section of we had a \"full meal\". We contacted the bar manager \"James\" who was the only nice person here. He told us that \"Joy\" was mistaken and we could sit where we pleased but we just had to go to the bar to order food, which for us was no big deal. We sat down and then noticed we didn't have any silverware. We went to an empty table to retrieve some since no one was going to be \"serving\" us and were promptly told by \"Joy\" that we had to leave the silverware there for people who say where they were supposed to!!!! I've never met a more rude hostess. I hope this is seen and she is trained on how to work in a customer service based atmosphere. We will not be coming back to this TK's and won't recommend it to anyone. Wish I could give it less than one star. :(",

The bartenders, except one I'll mention below, are always the friendliest compared to most places I have been.   Watch out for one bartender in particular.  To give a better image, he looks Asian.  I asked for two mason jars of my favorite - a long beach.  He got caught up talking to others at the bar, which I could care less, except he ended up giving me two cups of the drink.  When I told him again that I wanted mason jars, he rolled his eyes, poured the cups into jars and added a little bit more of whatever they put in, slammed the jars on the counter, and told me \"$50.\"  I'm not the type to throw a fit, so after paying $44 all weekend, I paid the $50 and still tipped him pretty good.  I was disappointed that my drink tasted like pink lemonade more than how they usually make it, but like I said, I was having fun and didn't want to fuss in public.  I figured I'd let the world know his customer service skills instead of him himself.  Either way, I'll go back every time!",

At night it is extremely loud (don't go there to hold a conversation) and it takes forever to put your order in, get a drink, and get your meal. It's not so bad earlier in the day, especially weekdays when it's less crowded. I usually get the steak and it's quality is usually great but not consistent. The burgers are excellent according to my husband.",

Drinks are good size, most served in mason jars. Real down home southern hospitality. When the Tony Marques band is playing, you hit a grand slam! Great food, Fun times!!",

Instead, we got:  -a 45 minute wait for a table -a Mom's Apple Cobbler in a plastic cup because the bartender left ice in the martini glass too long and it cracked. Mom's Apple Cobbler, incidentally, is white, creamy, and looks like a bodily fluid manufactured by the half of the population of which I am not a member. Thus, having it be served in a plastic cup made it look like I'd robbed a bank, and not the kind with money -water in plastic cups, NOT MASON JARS as advertised -a 30+ minute wait for food after ordering -soggy fish and chips with no chips -absent service -a clientele that summed up my impression of Las Vegas vacationers over the 4th of July: fat, white, and lethargic.  I don't love this bar.",

This is exactly what you would expect from a bar created by Toby Keith (except for the racist, right wing beliefs). The male to female ratio was definitely split 50/50 leaving plenty of fish for the single males and females. I think my favorite part about this place are the massive mason jar drinks. You only need two or three to get a solid buzz going on. And let me give you a fair warning for you timid types. If it's someones birthday they will be in for a surprise if they don't know what to expect. First a bar tender will stand up and blow a whistle violently then present a drink with whip cream in the shape of a penis or a vagina for the appropriate sex. They will then hold it down by their groin while you chug the whole thing. I have seen multiple people get scared and embarrassed but hey guess what? it's VEGAS! So chug away! the bartenders are the showman type throwing bottles behind their backs and making a hell of a show out of your order. Last note, whenever the Toby Keith song \"I love this bar\" comes on make sure you are near the bar because they will graciously throw out free shots straight from the bottle.",

    "text": "My friend wanted to find a cowboy.  I was at a point where I'd agree to pretty much anything.  We go to this bar, and it was a bit early (barwise) I guess (10:45?  11?) and it was just crowded enough.  There was some line-dancing, some country songs, some non-country songs, a live cover band which had a BEAUTIFUL lead singer... and then a Toby Keith impersonator and a Willie Nelson impersonator.  Though we may have been unsober enough to be rather certain for some period of time that they were REALLY Toby Keith and Willie Nelson.    So I definitely had a pretty fantastic time.  There were a few moments with sketchy men, which might be one reason I'm not throwing 5 stars out.  They also don't have a bathroom in the restaurant, so you have to go back into Harrah's, and they wouldn't stamp my hand when I left to go (we got there before the hand stamping started) so it was possible if it got crowded I couldn't get back in (luckily I did, but the uncertainty didn't make me happy).  Also, 6 dollars for a Bud Light makes me a sad panda, even though I know it's Vegas.  I don't even know why I ordered a Bud Light- I don't even LIKE Bud Light.    However, the drinks were totally served in mason jars when I was there, and a bartender poured shots down people's throats for free at some point.  That was pretty fun.  The crowd was also REALLY into the music, which added a lot.  However, there could have been more single cowboys (for my friend, of course...).",

I had the pulled pork which is my sandwich of choice that I base places on and the BBQ sauce was amazing - I bought a bottle before we left.  My husband had the chicken fried steak and loved it also.    The second time we went last year, we showed up when they opened at 11am, grabbed a barstool, and left at 5pm.  We had met up with friends of mine from high school that I hadn't seen since high school (16 years!).  The bartenders were awesome for the whole 6 hours, and as much as I loathe domestic brews, the 2 for 1 specials allowed us to have a low tab and be sufficiently drunk.  I love all the free shots when they play the signature song, too!  I still had plenty of Shiner Bocks and a few mixed drinks and a few shots of Jager along with a plate of nachos and we left there with a bill of $45.  I can't wait til the next time we're in Vegas to spend some more time there.  It's very convenient to get to from the monorail, but pretty far back in Harrah's off the strip.  Still worth the effort.",

We tried the Fried Pickles (too much batter, the pickle itself was pretty good though), Biscuits and Gravy with Chicken and the Bronco Burger.  The wife said the biscuits and gravy was pretty good, but the oil that the chicken was fried in made it taste just like the pickles which didn't leave a good after taste.  Bronco burger is like a kitchen sink of burgers. Pulled pork, Bacon, Onion Ring + the normal fixings of a burger. It was good, nothing super special but it was a solid burger. The meat itself was very well done which was a bummer, but I ain't gonna complain about that. I must say that they need to change the oil or something because my fries tasted just like my wifes chicken and the fried pickles.  Overall, I'd probably pass next time. Even though it is located inside one of my favorite hotels to stay at on the strip.",

It was disappointing that while eating lunch, we didn't hear, \"I love this bar\" and sad that they used to give shots when it played and they no longer do that.

Waitress was friendly and prompt. Food was a little slow, but likely that's because it takes time to cook a thick burger from scratch. Overall a pleasant experience, but not much different from a Ruby Tuesday or TGIF (I'd thought it would be different from them somehow).",

With grand kids in tow we were also looking for family and kid friendly.  Our group of five ordered chicken fried steak, ribs, and other beef items.  The food took a long time to arrive, served by a friendly waitress in a leather thong and chaps.  To quote my 17 year old grand son, \"What the hell grandpa.\"  When the food did arrive the rare steaks we ordered were well done, my chicken fried steak was so dried out I couldn't eat it, and the waitress uniforms were definitely not family friendly.  Our tab was right at $200, so I wouldn't call the prices reasonable.  Fortunately we don't travel to Vegas often, but if we do return Toby's place will be off our list for sure.",

    "text": "Honestly, I did not know who Toby Keith until I actually looked him up on the Internet while we were dining.  When we are in Las Vegas, I often pick the place to eat when I am with my family.  However, this time around, since we were Casino hopping via the Monorail; I capitulated to the group's choice.  We normally eat at the other establishments and we don't go to Bar & Grills. But since everyone was famished, and they wanted to eat NOW, they chose the closest restaurant to our stop.  We were greeted by the hostess as we walked through the entrance. She was very pleasant and nice. This seemingly impromptu choice by my family seemed like it would turn out to be a good choice. The place was brightly lit, clean, spacious, and there were not that many patrons so we had plenty of great seats to choose from.  The hostess grabbed the menus, exited from the booth that she was situated in, and led us to our table. Now, the punch line here is that as we followed her; none of us could help but notice the fact that she was wearing chaps and nothing was covering her rear except for very small (and nearly non-existent) panties.  Well, this was a great choice - Family!? I had this perplexed look on my face, as I stared onto my wife's and daughter's grinning faces!  Derriere's aside, and there was plenty of it, the food and the service were actually not bad. Our waitress was very prompt and attentive to our needs.  I had the All American Burger, that this monstrosity of a sandwich could've fed all of us. It seemed as if the quoted weight of this burger was post cooking, because It definitely was too big to hold with one hand - let alone put any part of it in my mouth.  My wife had the Ribeye, and she indicated that it was well seasoned, and properly prepared.  The rest had various sandwiches, BBQ Beans, and Mac & Cheese. Everything tasted good.  This seemingly humorous departure from our normal dining venues proved both fun, relaxing and surprisingly satisfying. And by the time we were ready to leave, the lights were dimmed and the crowds started to roll in. Apparently, after a certain time, there is a band that plays on the stage, and country dancing ensues.  We didn't stick around for that, but we left satisfied!",

A good chicken or BBQ should stand on its own without sauce to hide the quick-fix process.  The green beans were shriveled and the potatoes, while flavorful, we're just scooped from a big mound somewhere.  Could have been better, but could have been worse.  Maybe I'll try a burger next time, but appreciate the restaurant for what it is...a big name joint on the strip in Vegas.",

This was my 1st time and I can not wait to come back and try the steak entree.   I ordered the meatloaf and was more than over joyed with the abundance of flavor and how tender and fresh the entire meal was! It came with your choice of one side, fresh vegies, corn bread, and rolls :)  They offerer a lighter side menu, which includes a turkey burger that looked to die for,  and came with the most amazing french fries!!!   The service was the sad part of this experience, the waiter was neglecting our table to say the least. He had a few larger parties he was dealing with at the same time and focused on them a lot. I will not knock a star down because of this one waiter in there restaurant because the rest of the waiters looked on point and were nothing but friendly.  There is a large bar area, and some room for dancing, large screen tvs for country music videos and plenty of pictures of Toby Keith :) There is also a gift shop located right next door that has a bunch of cleaver take home gifts and reasonable prices.  What are you waiting for all you country fans, and food junkies..go go go!",

Being a non-red meat eater doesn't leave me with many choices on this menu, so I've ordered a quesadilla both times I've been here. I love food with a Mexican flare, but it's just not very memorable here. The service is fine, and they serve beverages in large jars (which is nice), but being located in Vegas does this place a disservice because I just imagine eating elsewhere due to the many options on Vegas.

I ordered the beer battered fish and chips. The fish that was brought to me was presented well, on top of some delicious fries and fried golden brown...however when I bit into my first piece I was pretty confused...  ...what I was tasting was some sort of weird fish flavored paste that stopped me from finishing my meal..DON'T ORDER THE FISH!!!  The atmosphere of this place however was really cool if you're into country and the french fries were great as well as the appetizer of mac and cheese balls!  Our waitress was pretty terrible and paid little to no attention to us..didn't get a refill of water to wash the fish paste out of my mouth.  My girlfriend on the other hand ordered a bleu burger and she said it was really good..so touche Toby Keith's I love This Bar & Grill for delivering me crappy food when you have an arsenal of better options!  I can't stress this enough though..DON'T ORDER THE FISH!!!  Also a bit pricey for a $$ imo. $19 for fish-paste..blehhh",

No server in 1/3 of the restaurant for Sunday night Football??  3 bartenders working and I still stood and waited 12 minutes to order a drink. $10.50 for a house bloody mary?! It was served in a very small plastic cup (not even a red Solo cup!) and the mix came from the gun!  As I waited, I watched the bartenders screw up two orders (gave group A's food to group B and vice versa)... and then proceed to swap everything out after about 2 minutes! Unsanitary! And NO APOLOGY!  The 3 bartenders, all male, had ZERO personalities and attentiveness. One was just a downright asshole...to me, to my friends, to patrons at the bar.  I even left a long note and my phone number on my credit card slip...and no one had the balls to call me to discuss their atrocious service. They must not care.

No, it's not what you think....But there are A LOT of life sized, and larger posters, murals, standing figurines and videos of the country start at this establishment...Many of them featuring his trademark \"Come Hither Cowboy\" look. Other than the creepiness....This  sports bar type place was a welcome surprise. Searching for a non-buffet, non-fast food dining option gets hard sometimes during a busy trade show at the adjoining property and I was happy to stumble upon Toby Keith's I love this Bar and Grill. It DOES get VERY crowded on Thurs-Fri and Sat nights so be warned...But for the most part it is a country themed casual eatery with an upbeat vibe. The service both at the tables and at the bar was good, even when busy. The waiters are pretty good ad describing some of the more \"eclectic\" items on the menu such as the fired bologna sandwich or the fried macaroni balls. The food was, I would say, a slight improvement on a Chili's or TGI Fridays type Americana type offering. Several fried southern surprises, as mentioned above...But I had both some appetizers, a salad and a burger, and all came as I ordered and were tasty and a good value. A great combination. HOWEVER, they do offer the \"100oz Challenge\" which, as I had heard was a giant burger, fried and beer..All totaling a combined 100 ounces. This is one of those John Canyd type challenges where you get a \"hootn and a hollerin\" reception when you ordered it, and a TShirt and Polaroid if you finish it...And a double bypass in a year or two. All in all a great dining, and drinking option tucked away in Harrahs Las Vegas. Keep up the good work...Yall!",

I can understand what an annoyance it can be to have 2 handfuls of troops come in and ask for the free burger && beer deal. Poor thing had to carry out 10 plates && 10 beers knowing that the tab's only going to be $25 at most (for the 2 appetizers). Given the scenario, I honestly didn't expect her to come by and check up on us, but she did. And she was so attentive despite what 20% of $25 is (don't worry, she got waaay more than 20% of the tab).  I'd give this place 5 stars if they didn't charge so much for mediocre food. $14 for an OK tasting burger? Cmon now. I can slap together the same burger @ home for $12.50 cheaper!",

We went there because my husband's best friend had Navy friends in town.  They said they liked the food...didn't see what they had.   Service is okay...They were busy and don't have very many people working at the bar.  You're going to have to wait to get a drink if it's at all busy in there.  Drink prices are pretty typical for a Strip eatery/bar.  My favorite thing about going here is you have choices in a close proximity.  Carnival court, casino gambling, etc. are all pretty close in walking distance.",

    "text": "Three years ago when I started visiting Vegas on vacations I loved going to Toby Keith Bar because it had a great country feeling with a fun staff. The last two times I have come however it has been the complete opposite. The only reason it was so horrible the last two times was because of the bartenders. The first time I went we had a guy bartender who was giving attitude to every guy around us for no reason and only paid attention to hot girls who flirted with him. I would sit there forever waiting for a drink and when he finally got to me he got my order wrong and when I told him he told me I didn't tell him that drink and he made a big seen throwing my drink in the trash and giving me a dirty look. Later on in the night I saw him be rude to many polite customers and even kiss a few female customers which disgusted me since he had a wedding ring on.   We came back the next time we were in Vegas hoping he wouldn't be there which he wasn't, thank God! Yet we ended up with the same problem. The bar was practically empty yet me and my husband waited fifteen minutes for a drink because the bartender was to busy flirting with two girls sitting at the bar. Every time this one girl took a sip of her drink he would pour a little more wine in. Then when he finally got to us all I asked for was a malibu and coke and he somehow screwed it up and I couldn't get his attention again to tell him so I had to go to another section of the bar to tell another bartender.  Sorry I know I am rambling on but I have been to a lot of bars in my life and have never been so angry by the service of a bartender. I use to love this place but I highly doubt I will ever go back because the bartenders care more about getting girls than keeping customers happy.",

We had the nachos, and they were amazing.  I also ordered one of their mixed drinks that came in a HUGE mason jar.  it puts those rinky dink mason jars to shame!!  My friend and I took a few shots before/during the meal, so I thought the food was amazing at the time--that might cloud my review, just FYI.  But the nachos were amazing as was my burger.  And my friends' fries :)  There was a sign outside the door that was a little off-putting, though.  It said there was a 90 minute time limit for diners.  However, we were there for over two hours and our waitress couldn't have cared less!",

We only waited for about 10 minutes for a table during the lunch rush, not bad. The hostess was perky and happy to see us, like we were old friends. She was busing tables as well and kept on going. Love to see a good attitude even when working hard.  Table service was prompt and the waitress polite and full of smiles.   I had NO idea how HUGE the portions were going to be. But having not eaten since before our flight the night before, we were quite hungry.  My mother in law ans I had the pulled pork sandwiches and my husband a burger. Even with how hungry we were, we had a hard time finishing. The pulled pork was tender and juicy, not to sweet with a little kick. Just the way I like it. Potato salad and a pickle spear, topped off with sweet tea. Absolutely NO complaints.  Service and food were great!  Will visit again should I be in Vegas.",

Luckily we did find a seat and after about 15 mins the bartender gave us a menu. The next time we came around was about 45 mins later. Waited another 15 or so to get our beer and awhile for our food. Overall we were there over 2 hours. The food was decent but they need more servers. The hostess didn't seem to like her job and the bartenders are over worked, 2 bartenders for an entire bar and the area around, plus walk ups! They need at least 4 bartenders easy. Overall not impressed and not worth the wait.",

The drinks are served in mason jars, cute. The nachos were pretty good too. A band came on late night. I did not experience the dancers on the bars as some of the other yelpers have.

The staff went out of their way to accommodate our group going so far as to setting up a table for us in an already closed station near the stage and dance floor so our family had a good view of the stage. Service was very good, our waitress was pleasant and attentive as was the rest of the staff. The food has gotten WAY better since I was last here. My niece had the BBQ Pulled Pork, I had a Fried Bologna Sandwich-minus the miracle whip, my daughter had the BBQ beef sandwich and the boys had the Turkey Bacon Club sandwiches. We were all impressed with how delicious our sandwiches were, much better than when we were here last summer. The boys especially enjoyed the new seasoned steak fries. My husband I have been here a number of times over the past few years, but it was first time bringing the kids-and they had a great time. We used to love this bar...but now we REALLY LOVE this BAR!!  Our family has a new favorite dinner spot for regular visits to Sin City!",

    "text": "I always try and keep an open mind when going to dine at a Strip location, I know that the bulk of their business is tourists and that the prices might be a little high because of it but there is no excuse for any restaurant in a major name like Harrah's to not offer any LOCALS ONLY deals or discounts!  On to the positive because I really hate having to write anything negative unless I think it will really help someone else.  The food here has always been good, I've never ordered something and wished I hadn't, but to be fair I seem to wind up ordering the fried bologna sandwich every single time!  I guess it's a guilty pleasure, 15 bucks for a bologna sandwich is kinda steep though don't ya think?  I mean Bologna is the cheapest lunchmeat you can buy at the deli counter isn't it?!?  The beer here is the normal mix of stuff.. I remember really liking getting my mason jar full of Miller Lite in the past... yeah yeah I know what you're thinking... chubby man orders fried bologna but is worried about the calories in his BEER! ... I just like the taste of it dammit, I'm sure as hell not dieting!   But alas I've got another complaint, I ordered a miller lite draft and it says right on the menu $6 and when I ordered the waitress didn't say anything other than bottle or draft... DRAFT of course, I can drink it out of the bottle at home!   SOOOOO anyway out comes a HUGE mason jar filled with hoppy goodness and it was literally a quart!  So the mrs and I have a conversation about what a good deal that is at a strip-staruant!   Well bill time comes and I got charged $9, still not a bad price considering it was really two pints but FALSE ADVERTISING and the waitress should be clear if there is an extra charge.  I still did not get any satisfaction as to why it was $9 and it says $6 domestic on the menu.    All in all, I will definitely be back again it just won't be too soon without better pricing or maybe a locals night/special.   ATTENTION MANAGEMENT!  Do the waitresses really need to be walking around with their tan asses hanging out?  I'd be just as happy if they seated me while wearing a burka!",

It is Vegas so I'll leave the price at that ($63.00 for two burgers & fries, an appetizer of wings, Pepsi's and tip{$10}) and apparently it's slightly cheaper if you're a member of the players clubs. Service was good could have been a bit quicker, but again it was acceptable our waitress (Kelly) took great care of us. Two disclaimers 1) at least during the day it's 90% country music (I'm from Southern Alabama so this didn't bother me) 2) the waitresses wear tank tops, panties (bikini bottoms) and leather riding chaps; as a parent I possibly would abstain from taking my kids there, however the girls are wearing more clothes than Hooter's girls and we go there as a family and if you have your kids in Vegas they are going to see more than this on the Strip (and you know I have a point)",

I'd rather get my beer than watch the bar tenders kill time spinning and throwing liquor bottles, but that's just me.  Stop in for a drink I suppose, if you want to pay that much for drinks ($7 for a miller lite).

    "text": "\"I Love This Bar\". Great song, great place. Now I'm going to rate this place strictly as a bar, not as a grill, as I did not have any of the food. I came here on a Thursday night, and got in at about 10:30. No ID check, No cover charge, just walk on in and head up to the bar. Very cool. There was a live band playing, but they were very, very good. Played mostly country, but threw in some old classics to get people on the dance floor. It's a very modern country type atmosphere, and a LOT of fun. Noticed the bras hanging all around the bar, always kind of funny to notice the different sizes and styles.  All the drinks are served up in mason jars, pretty cool. Lots of beers on tap, although I decided with a Long Island Ice Tea. Very strong, and very good. Since it was my birthday, the bartender hooked me up with a free shot. Not quite sure what it is, but free booze is free booze. After about 30 minutes, the band decided to take a break, and a live DJ started up playing country hits, announcing FREE SHOTS at the bar. And boy, they weren't kidding. EVERYBODY made their way over to the bar, and the bartenders hooked everyone up with a free shot. Of course, the beautiful ladies had it poured into their mouth from the large dispenser, as it should be. The bartenders were very cool, made some very cool drinks, and were very interactive with all the people hanging at the bar. The band was pretty damn good, and had a LOT of people on the dance floor. One young lady, TRASHED beyond belief, had everyone's attention, especially after throwing her panties to the drummer. A lot of folks boot scootin' and doing the electric slide.  Good music, good times, and not a bad price. Definitely recommend this place as a chill alternative to the night clubs that dominate the Vegas scene. Stop in, relax, enjoy some good country, and drink your face off.",

I'm use to paying 3 dollars or so for a domestic beer (Miller Lite) I'd even pay $4. But $6 is ridiculous. Even for the Strip. The mixed drinks are a minimum of $12 and they come in small glasses. My girlfreind wanted a sprite and that cost $3.50 and was in a small glass that you couldn't even put an entire can of sprite into...and it had ice in it! So this place is an obvious rip off. I HATE THIS BAR!",

When she came back we placed our food orders and got an appetizer. That took at least another 15-20 minutes! (all we ordered was chips and salsa w/ queso dip..not much prep required). We finally got our entrees and asked for some ranch, more water, and a soda. Ranch was brought to our table AFTER we had already finished eating and refills were never brought! Not only the service sucked but I was NOT impressed by the food for how pricey everything was! Such a disappointing experience for such a big name. Definitely wont be going back there!!",

They were served with a fluorescent orange cheese like sauce.  They weren't terrible, but they could have been hotter.  The quesadillas were just gross.  The nachos were okay.  The best thing about this place is that they serve Pepsi and it comes in a huge mason jar.  Avoid.",

I sent it back and what I got back wasn't much better.  Looked and tasted like boiled chicken strips.  Ask the others in my party and not one could say their meal was outstanding.  Had a bite of my Mom's chicken-fried steak and I've had better from IHOP which is not saying much at all.  I am disappointed with Harrah's for allowing this type of sub standard food go to people visiting our city.  Step it up if you're going to charge people that amount of money!!  Other than the food the place looked good and loved the shots given out at the bar after the alarm sounded.  New chefs would complete this place!!",

    "text": "Our first night in Vegas we got in late and really had no idea where to eat.  Starving as we walked the strip we found our way into Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill.  The name of this place not withstanding, it didn't seem too bad atmosphere wise.  Our waitress was nice and attentive, and my group of friends all seemed to dig the faux country atmosphere despite being from New Jersey and having no connection to the country at all.     But yeah, the food, what this review is all about.  Suffice to say I was not impressed.  Looking at the menu I had a slight heart attack.  All the options seemed to be highly unhealthy and likely to send you into a food coma after eating them.  Ok, I understand that this isn't Trader Joe's and can deal with that if the food is good.  I decided to pick what I figured to be the healthiest thing on the menu, the Chicken Caesar wrap.  The rest of my group got Fried Bologna sandwiches and one pasta with Alfredo sauce.    My Chicken Caesar wrap for lack of a better word, sucked.  The wrap had very little chicken, and was mostly packed with lettuce (no tomato or onions).  This may have been somewhat tolerable if the chicken and lettuce weren't drenched in a watery slop they call Caesar dressing.  When I eat a wrap, I don't want it to leak.  I was really disappointed and so disgusted by the dressing I barely ate it (and I'm not a remotely picky eater).  Everyone else liked their dishes ok, but nobody polished off their plate or was really impressed.    If you come to this place skip the food- go to Capriotti's earlier in the day and buy a sub to save for dinner.  You'll save time, money, and yourself from a subpar meal.",

They still call french fries \"Freedom Fries\" - which may indicate the last time the menu was updated.    Lots of country music videos running, thankfully not all Mr Keith's.  The hostess was friendly and she really tried, we had a big group and she held it together and the orders came out together.  The women here wear chaps with hot pants which I guess is Vegas \"flair\".  The service was good although they gave me chicken I didn't order on my salad - boiled and refrigerated from yesterday or so - it was getting a little extra flavor.

When we sat down with the menu I noticed that my first option wasn't on there. I asked the waitress where the prime rib is that's on their website and she said 'oh that's an old menu.' So onto my second item which was the BBQ Rotisserie chicken. Yeah they sold out of that earlier today. I can tell at this point this is not going to go well. I ordered the sirloin medium rare and asked the waitress how the green beans were made. She stated they are cooked in butter and garlic - so I was in. When the dinner arrived my steak was cooked as ordered but had no taste to it. I don't think they seasoned it at all. The green beans had no flavor either. The mashed potatoes were good so that's why they get three stars. We were not impressed and won't be back!",

Food is unfortunate as you expect in Las Vegas. Indifferent prep and presentation.  Buying less expensive entree would probably be a better call to reduce the ripped off sensation that really adds to the insult.  Beware of being offered a \"double\" when ordering drinks. Not only is the price double, but they then add another \"double fee\" on top of that. The drink costs more than a rib eye dinner!  Pretty clever.  Good place to go if you like loud, mediocre and don't care what it costs to get it.",

My husband ordered the All American Burger, which came on a big bun, but the meat didn't even touch the edges of the bun, he said it was not very tasty, and it cost $13.99.  Will not be returning here again, too high price for under average food.",

Ok so We were there on a Thursday (1/30/14) for lunch and we were seated right away. After looking over the menu I ordered the grilled chicken wrap and fries and the hubby ordered a club sandwich(sans fries, fries are extra) I was very excited to try my food because it looked good( sigh I should have ordered the burger the safest choice) . My wrap was huge BUT where was the chicken....I searched and searched and only pulled lots of lettuce and corn and then ohhh yes there is my one piece of chicken (huh?) blah not happy. My hubby must have seen the starved look in my eyes so he shared his club sandwich. It was actually good but then again can a person really mess up processed meats on bread?  Well...I don't think id go back it just doesn't seem worth it. Our waitress was a peach but great service for not so good food ( ehh). I think next time I'll stick to American diner at the nyny hotel.",

All the cowboys in town find their way here, but so do the bachelorette parties, woo girls, frat boys, football fans, old couples, etc.   It gets quite packed at peak times. Bar and table service can be exceptionally slow. The food ain't much to write home about. The drinks are overpriced and kinda sucky. But you don't come here for the eating and drinking. You come here to walk around, shake your head, and repeatedly say to yourself \"just who the hell does Toby Keith think he is?!\" - and to just watch all the crazy people having a crazy time.",

Next, the dance floor was busy but not ...hey, I just going to hold off going to the bathroom because if I leave this 1x1 inch square I've carved out for myself, there is no way in hell I'm getting it back, feeling. Finally, the music! If you think it's solely country music, think again. Maybe it was the band this past Saturday (8/29/15) but they played a wonderful mix of contemporary and old school country, classic rock, old school hip hop (gin & juice, anybody?), and a little 90's rock.  I had a heck of a time...in a good way. So much so that I think I sang my little heart out to where the next morning I was sounding like Carol Channing (RIP).",

I got a Georgia Peach and my mom got a Spiked Cheery Vanilla Coke, and they were both delicious. We also ordered fried pickle spears for an appetizer and they were delicious. I order fried picked Spears whenever available and these were some of the best, if not the best, I've ever had. You could tell they were hand breaded.   I got the Texas cheesesteak with fries. The cheesesteak was SO good, the fries were thick cut (thick cut fries aren't my favorite, so don't really have an unbiased opinion of those). My mom ordered the honey salmon and said she thought it was one of the best she's ever had. My dad ordered a steak with beer bartered shrimp and said the steak had really good flavor, and the shrimp was some of the best he's had.   Obviously not the finest dining on the strip, but so good if you're looking for a casual meal.",

There is a Toby Keith shot you can take with Mezcal and a worm in it. We all chocked out to try it but it looks fun!  The drink selection isn't anything you wouldn't expect from a sports bar kind of place.  My family and friends came in for a birthday dinner and they so kindly gave us all (yes, all 10 of us) a shot to take with the guest of honor! There was no loud obnoxious embarrassing singing either!  This bar has a decent sized menu. Lots of options, and surprisingly everything we ordered was delicious. In the photos I posted the Texas cheese steak is just like a Philly but with pulled pork brisket seasoned and delicious! It's so juicy that the bottom bun will be a bit soggy but it's tolerable. The other photo is the black and Bleu burger. They cooked it medium just like i asked beautifully! Don't expect the typical Bleu cheese crumble though. It's a sauce! Very tasty and all the food was seasoned appropriately!   The experience was great, food was great, service was decent and this review gets 4 stars because we lacked a personal experience with the servers. No one went out of their way to speak with us or joke around or wish the birthday man a good one. It was all business. Which is fine, but that's what made this a 4 star review!  We will be back!",

It was her first time in Vegas and we had to (kindly) explain to her that there was going to be many more booty sightings before the trip was over - it is Vegas after all. My only complaint is that the music was way too loud. We really couldn't talk at all without leaning into each other's ears, which was kind of annoying.

We chilled at the bar and were eventually seated in a booth near the back. Our server was nice enough although she seemed to be rushing us through the meal a bit. The food was okay, but nothing to write home about. Then again, the price wasn't as bad as you'd expect on the strip either. About halfway through our meal, a cover band started playing some Toby Keith songs, but we were too far away to see them and the stereo system wasn't very good. Overall, the evening was a bit of a letdown and I don't think we will be back. We have the pictures to prove we went once and that's enough.",

Screaming at the TVs for their teams and being obnoxious.  The bartender upsold me to the biggest size drink and was fancy with this bottle flipping skills.  We were checking out the menu for later, because we were going to a show inside Harrah's later that night, but decided to go elsewhere for our meal, it's basic burgers and bar food, which we can get anywhere.  It was alright.  Depends what you're into.",

Got a house whiskey and club soda, which was like $11.25 (ridiculous) and a Blue Moon for like $8.   Drank my whole beer and found my orange still had the little paper on the outside, which is pretty gross.   Decent live music and crowd but there are plenty of better places in Vegas to spend your time. Super overpriced, even for Vegas.",

That said - my boyfriend and I really enjoyed our dinner here, and I think it was probably the best meal we had on our recent trip to Vegas, which is sort of sad.      We went for the fun atmosphere (there is Toby memorabilia everywhere and they play country music videos non-stop, which are about 2/3rds Toby Keith ones), but we were surprised that we actually really enjoyed the food!  We split the chicken fried steak ($16) and had more than enough for 2.  We were planning to order a dessert as well, but ended up being too full.  The steak itself was very tasty, and was served with gravy and excellent mashed potatoes.  The mac and cheese we chose as our side was more mediocre, but it also came with some cornbread, and some bread with sweet honey butter, which was really delicious.    Service was friendly, if a little confusing (she failed to bring us the cornbread at first, and when we asked for it, she said they didnt have any and that was why it hadn't come out, but then she brought some immediately).    Definitely one of the better options on the strip for moderately priced, tasty food, and I highly recommend, especially if you're a country fan.",

My bro and I finished off burgers with the Fried Twinkie which was actually pretty good. It's not a grease bomb like you'd think.  They have country music videos playing all the time and when Toby Kieth's \"I Love This Bar\" comes on everyone gets free shots poured directly in the mouth from a chick walking on the bar. Bras hanging above the bar keep the place extra classy.  The food's good, but I don't think the burger and fries are worth the $13-14 I paid. That's my only complaint. I do believe I'll return with friends so we can eat, drink and dance. Seemed like there was enough space by the video screen for some country dancin' and west coast swing.",

We got our drinks pretty quick then it took another 15 minutes for our server (Lisa) to take our order.  In all we had two cheese burgers, one chili burger, two waters, one iced tea and a lemon drop martini. The bill came to $60.00. My chili burger had zero flavor.

The wings are whole wings and they give you 8...so for 12 bucks,  receiving 16 True wingettes, there were no complaints here. We got a mixture of plain, buffalo and BBQ and they were good. I think I'd pass on the strips  next time, but the chocolate brownie sundae made up for it.   Overall 3 stars because our server Dara left us just sitting a couple of times while she listened to the band. For 4.00 per fountain drink,  I needed her to be a little more attentive and at least offer a refill, but that didn't happen.  I'd return though.",

Our server was unbelievably friendly, and was patient as we took time to altogether decide what we wanted. Drinks and food came out promptly, and everything just amazed me.  My rib/ wing combo consisted of two flavors of each meat, and both meats were just beautifully tender and flavorful. My mouth is watering as I reminisce. The mashed potato side was also wonderful, and the fries put me over the moon.  Meanwhile, mixed drinks came in 32-oz. mason jars. My Georgia peach one was great--not too sweet, not too strong, a perfect mix that lasted each of us a long while.   I wish there were a better way to convey my adoration for TK's. But in short, it's definitely worth a try: the meat is delicious, the drinks are fantastic, the people are great.",

Seats are widely spaced apart so your not sharing food with your neighbor.    Started with the fried mac and cheese balls.  $10 for 4 balls.  They were lightly beer battered and not too greasy.  Came quickly in about 7 minutes after ordering the app and our dinner. Absolutely delicious.  I almost wanted to cancel the dinner and order some more. Recommended.   Next came dinner.  I got the pulled pork sandwich with fries. Good but not over the top.  I was in the mood for good so it worked for me. The waitress asked me if I was ok with the coleslaw.  I was , but glad she asked.   The coleslaw added a crisp bite to the chunky pork lathered in the slightly tangy sauce.  It was a nice medley to compliment the soft chewy bun.   My girlfriend got the old West cheeseburger and she says 10/10.   The bun was buttery and soft and the party cooked to perfection. (Well done).  Not my choice of doneness but whatever works is what works.   We finished everything so that must mean we liked it.    Overall. 9/10.  Beer was cold.  Food was delicious. And the environment was country.  Just what we like.   Baseball and football games all over the place on about 20 televisions.",

    "text": "A group of friends and I decided to visit Toby Keith's I Love This bar & Grill for dinner.  We got in without reservations with only a minimal wait at 6:00 on a weeknight in July.  It was a little tricky to find as it was upstairs and around a corner inside of a casino (Harrah's Las Vegas), but after wandering around for a while we finally figured it out.    The decor is very cutesy country, fitting since the bar's namesake, Toby Keith, is a famous country singer.  The atmosphere alone is worth part of the cost of the meal.  We pushed together a couple of tables and ordered a few drinks.  Now, I should probably warn you, as I WISH someone had warned me, that their drinks are HUGE and come in large mason jars.  Even the adult beverages come in these same jars, and they don't make them weak an watered down, either.  You'll be feeling your liquor by the end of your first one, and I had more than one.  I was drinking one of their signature cocktails called The Patriot. The Patriot consists of Jim Beam Kentucky Bourbon, Southern Comfort, dry vermouth, and sour mix with just a splash of sierra mist on top.   Let me tell you, they go down smooth.  I had a sip of my friend's Georgia Peach (vodka, peach schnapps, and sierra mist, and it wasn't too shabby either.  When it came time to order the entree I decided to go with the BBQ'D rotisserie chicken as it looked like one of the healthiest items on the menu.  For about $18 I got a half chicken slow cooked on a rotisserie to a tender and moist perfection and brushed with a generous helping of barbecue sauce.  It came with a choice of two sides; I chose mixed vegetables and a baked potato.  I asked them to put just cheese and bacon on the potato and put the butter and sour cream on the side. Everything was tasty and while I felt stuffed by the end of the meal, at least I didn't feel like I'd clogged my arteries with grease.  One of my friends even mentioned how tasty my plate looked.  I'd definitely come back again the next time I'm in Vegas",

    "text": "I was in search of a convenient late late and stumbled upon this country and western music theme restaurant. Let's give it a go!   The menu here is burgers and more burgers and is trying hard to make a  memorable impression: drinks served in novelty red plastic cowboy boots (definitely my kinda place! Joke!) Oddly, the water is served in Mason jars. Since that's retro chic I was surprised, as there's nothing chic about this place. Some burgers come stabbed with a steak knife to hold them together.    Another surprise was the hostess lady - she walks around in cowboy chaps which isn't that big a deal, but she only wore a pair of modest black knickers underneath, like a bikini bottom. You can't help but stare! This was probably the oddest addition to this potentially wholesome restaurant - a cheeky bit of Vegas twist I guess. Another bit of the entertainment is the music videos playing on the screens. All country music and probably lots of Toby Keith stuff.  My turkey burger with advocado was ok. It bet it would've tasted better with the fries. I got the potato salad which did seem homemade and not from a plastic box, but who knows what's real in Vegas! :) My waitress said the burger came with fruit, but I didn't see any in my basket. I paid around $15 for the pleasure of this ok/average burger.",

When we went to pay, we were told our gift cards are not valid in Nevada or Oklahoma (where most of the restaurants are located).   So- we had to come up with  the cash (again- we only went there because we had the card- there were many places closer to where we are staying), and now we're still stuck with a gift card we can't use.  Tried calling the corporate office- number is no longer valid.  Currently waiting for the Las Vegas location to call me back with a good number to call.  Bottom line- DO NOT GO HERE TO USE A GIFT CARD BECAUSE THEY WON'T TAKE IT!!!",

Toby Keith has a great atmosphere and the waitress wear assless chaps. That took me completely by surprise. Our waitress quickly took our order and was prompt on delivery.  She recommended the steaks, chicken fried steak, and the the fajitas.   I ordered the combo fajitas which was $25. Unfortunately the food is extremely lacking. Every meal ordered by our party of 9 was disappointing. My meats were bland and flavor less. One of my groups mentioned that my steaks were beef jerky. The food quality wouldn't have been so bad if the prices weren't so unbelievably high for the food. I wouldn't return to this location. They are opening a newer location on my home town so I'll try that once to see if it's similar.",

    "text": "My wife and I arrived for dinner at 8:15pm on a Friday.  We were in Harras to see a show later in the evening and didn't want to stray too far before the theater just in case we were delayed at dinner.  We had eaten here before years ago and frankly nothing stood out from that first experience so I wasn't expecting much from this visit.  There was a short wait to get a table which we filled at the bar getting a beer.  The bartender noticed my active duty military ID and recommended we tell our server to get a free meal.  A few minutes later we sat down to our table and were greeted by Julie Me, our server.  I had my wallet resting on the table and my military ID was visible.  Julie immediately noticed and informed me my military ID gets me a free 1/4 pound burger, fries, and domestic beer (which included a Lagunitas IPA) which is what I would have ordered anyway so that was perfect!  Julie was super friendly and attentive and made our visit more enjoyable.  Our total bill was less than $20 before tip.  The burger was good as were the fries.  I would have been happy with it even paying full price.  My wife ordered a salad and was also happy with her meal.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was nice and welcoming with interesting props to catch your eye when walking around.  Overall, I'd say this is a four star experience for the price and food quality.  I'm adding a fifth star because of Julie's exceptional service and Toby Keith's respect for military members.  This is the best military discount anywhere in Vegas and deserves some recognition.  We'd definitely return, even without a military ID.",

The drinks were fine (kept it simple with a Jack and Coke) and the music was pretty good....until they took a break like 30 mins later. They couldn't get the sound system back working so for 20 minutes the band and the house sound guys wrestled with how to get the sound back on as the crowd thinned and my wife boredly watched American Ninja Warrior on a distant TV. After a few more minutes of failed electrical work, we hit the old dusty trail and found a watering hole with actual music. Seriously, y'all, this is Vegas. The dive bar down the street doesn't have this much trouble getting the amps set up and ready to go.",

A group of us came here because one of our friend suggested this restaurant as she was staying in Harrah's. I noticed there is a retail shop and I read that there is a stage with live country music but there was no live music when we went there this Easter Sunday around 6pm.  There is a Toby Keith shot that you can take with Mezcal and a worm in it and you can win a T-shirt.  I ordered a cocktail, it was $24 for the drink & $15 re-fills.  All beverages can come served in a 32 oz. Mason Jar. Not a strong drink at all and quite pricey for drinks. I has th Jumbo Beer Battered Shrimp- Flash fried jumbo shrimp, with choice of tartar or cocktail sauce. The breading were thick, the shrimp was ok, nothing special. My bf had their famous Fried Bologna Sandwich which was not great. It tastes like spam. The portions of food were large though.

There was a lot of conversation.  The music playing was just loud enough to know it was there but they did not try to overpower the room.  And, it was not C & W which made me happy!  After being seated, drink orders were taken and the drinks soon arrived.  After looking over the menu, I opted for the jalapeno cheddar burger.  The burger was topped with jalapeno poppers.  It was supposed to be on a jalapeno bun, but I tasted no pepper flavor in the bun.  Perhaps it's stated that way because the burger has a long toothpick through it with some pickle slices and a roasted jalapeno on top.  The burger came with an order of fries.  The burger is one of those large ones--1/2 pound patty--that you have to eat with knife and fork or squish things together to be able to eat it as you would a regular burger.  The fries were OK but I like regular fries rather than these steak fries.  For dessert, two of us ordered the peach melba.  It was good and it was amazing that I didn't finish mine.  I was just too full--something you don't often see me doing.    When I left after our show, the bar area was busy and the C & W music was blaring into the hallway.  I'm so glad I was there early.",

It's all very Southern US (fried cheese macaroni balls are ever so good appetizers). We got the full rack of St. Lois style ribs (yes, falling off the bone it was) which was more than the two of us could finish. Ordering against the stream, I ordered a Negroni. The bartender actually ran downstairs to get the Campari. Can you believe it. That is looking out for your customer.",

Today, with many comp points in hand and too many drinks down my gully, I thought this a quick good 'ole boy place to grab a sober-up meal.  Wrong. Went with the $17 Po' Boy (thank God it was essentially free), and was delivered an 80% mediocre bread ensemble with some KFC-grade fried nickel shrimp plopped in between the gluten. One bite and they all fly out.   Dry sad shrimp, blase bread, and depressingly over-priced, just skip this joint and go straight to the parking garage to drive somewhere, anywhere, else.  Bonus star for service. The people I spoke with were nice.",

I loved the fact that our drinks came in Mason jars which is awesome. I had the sloppy joe, which I haven't had in years. Matter of fact, I'm not sure I have ever seen that on a menu.   After dinner we decided to move over to the bar as the live band started. One of the things to watch here is the bartenders. They are good and a blast to watch make drinks. Oh and strong. I had to tell them to lighten my drinks so I could make it through the night. (lite weight, I know).   The dance floor was a little small and unfortunately they closed at like 12:30 which was a little disappointing. Other than that, a great place to visit.",

Waitress didn't ask us what size drinks we wanted, but rather just assumed them to be large. ($24 for each drink from the bar?). She had no personality whatsoever and was very short with us.  She couldn't remember to bring us our steak sauce and other items, so we had to ask another waitress for them.  She never checked up on us either. Dessert took forever to be brought to us. Thought it would be a fun vibe in a place like this, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Mortuaries are more fun. I'm surprised Toby Keith put his name on a joint like this. What a joke! \"I hate this bar\"!",

We weren't looking to go to a buffet, so we found a list of spots that were serving a special Thanksgiving dinner. This spot was right next door to our hotel and I'm really glad we ended up going here. The deal was $25 for a 3 course meal. It started with a divine butternut squash soup that I could have eaten an entire tub of. As I was licking the plate clean, they brought out the main course, which had a little bit of everything you'd find at the Thanksgiving dinner table. Everything on the plate was incredible. We both liked the stuffing best, but the turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, and sweet potato were all perfect as well. My least favorite thing was the collard greens, but there was so much on the plate, I could hardly finish the stuff I liked. The dessert was pumpkin pie, which honestly tasted like it was a slice of grocery store pumpkin pie, but we were so full and enjoyed the appetizer/entree so much, it didn't matter at that point. We washed all this down with 2 large $13 mason jars of beer. We were still working on them when the bill came and the waitress asked if we wanted to go cups for the rest. Only in Vegas, right? All said and done, we spent about $100 for the dinner. After a long day mostly spent in the car, this holiday dinner is exactly what we wanted and we had a great experience here.",

There are a number of televisions, showing either sports or Toby Keith in concert.  Waitresses are uniformly thin, wear tight leather mini-skirts and short white tops, call everyone \"hon\" and are terminally cheerful.  The food is OK.  The fried bologna sandwich consists of a thick slab of pretty good bologna, lightly fried, with caramelized onions, American cheese, lettuce, and tomato, on Texas garlic bread.  If you like greasy food (like me), it's not bad; if you have a low grease tolerance, stay away!  For dessert, the sweet potato pecan pie with bourbon ice cream was a disappointment.  The combination of the two kinds of pie sounds like a good idea, but neither of the fillings was especially good.  On the other hand, the ice cream was very rich, a big plus.  Cola was served in a large mason jar.  I'm glad I went once, but don't plan to return.",

I like that it's just off the parking garage so we don't have to push and shove our way through a crowded smoky casino to get there.    The first time we went I ordered a steak, but what they don't tell you on the menu is that it comes smothered in mushrooms.  I'm deathly allergic and had to send it back to have it re-done.  It would have been nice to know ahead of time.  However, the waitress let me keep my sides so at least I got to eat some of my meal with my party.    My favorite thing on the menu is the mac and cheese, and my husband has a sweet tooth for the deep fried twinkies.  I've ordered something different every time I've gone and other than the death steak it has all been really good.  When they have been busy, we have even recieved a free appetizer.  I've read some people bitching that they got a plastic cup instead of the advertised mason jar.  Big deal, the place sells the mason jars and they do get busy.  God forbid they sell drinks faster than the dishwasher can do dishes.  Over all this is a fun place to eat that has good food and fair service, but I would not recomend it if you hate country music.",

No one in our 5 person party liked any item- not appetizers, entrees nor desserts! Cold, soggy, bland, dry, and overall unappealing. Visit the gift shop but skip the restaurant.",

It was so soggy I only are the chicken out of it since I was so hungry. Fries were ok but salty. All my friends had sandwiches or wraps and did not like theirs either. Was not worth the money. The music was good if you like country and they do have a dance floor but would not recommend the food.",

I saw a lot of the bartenders and wait staff either sitting talking to one another or talking \"too long\" to just one customer.

So sorry - the bar wasn't even busy - it's not like we were taking up space from customers who were waiting to order a drink.  I've never experienced such a rude bartender in my entire life - I guess I shouldn't expect much from something associated with Toby Keith. yuck.",

    "text": "I am reviewing this place after eating there only one time...but I must say, I am IN LOVE WITH TOBY KEITH'S!  First, the food:  Amazing. That is how I would describe it. I got the Baby Back Ribs and had the biggest grin on my bbq-covered face as I savored each bite. Never have I eaten something more delicious. I understand how there are plenty of other places YOU might have been that contradict that, and I just may eat at crappy restaurants, but I am serious when I say it was the best Ribs I have ever eaten. I sampled some food from everyone in my party, and everything was absolutely incredible.  Next: the drinks:  I'll keep this short because I only had one drink (and some of others), but their drinks tasted really good. I only ordered at the table and not the bar, but what I had was delicious and I approve.  The atmosphere:  From what I saw, there was the eating area, a bar, a dance floor, and a stage with live music. The place was very loud, and country music was blaring, but it was entertaining. I have no interest in country music whatsoever but I still enjoyed the music and had a great time. There were dancers on some of the tables that were absolutely gorgeous. I was temped to just be a creeper at the bar because of how beautiful the girls were, but then again, that would be creepy :P  Finally, the staff:  I had no issues at all with the staff. We had not made a reservation so we had to wait maybe 30 minutes (but again, there were dancers, so I didn't mind standing around). When the time to be seated finally came, we were placed right near the stage. It was loud so we requested a different table. They quickly accommodated us and moved us closer to the entrance. The waitress then came by and took our orders, and was on point to bring our appetizers/drink refills whenever needed. Our food was prepared very quickly and everyone's order was perfect.  Final verdict?  Like I said before, I have only eaten here once. The one time I was there I had an awesome time. I loved the food, the atmosphere, and everything about the place. I told a friend eating with me that I will come back every time I am in vegas, and that I must bring my family there. The food was top notch and the service was great. I highly recommend Toby Keith's and hope you have the same excellent service that I did.",

If you liked southern brewed sweet iced tea, which isn't available in the Northeast where I live, you will enjoy it here. I had the fried catfish, coleslaw and fries. Two decent sized catfish fillets that were hot and tasty as hell! Fries were your average fries. Though, I have had better coleslaw. For dessert, I had the pecan pie which was delish! Stop by the Toby store next door too. Plenty of 2XL shirts here to be had.",

First impression of this place was wow, nice low key, laid back place. The food smelled really good and my stomach was ready ;) We were seated near the bar area and once in a while during dinner you'd hear whistles going off and a showdown going on at the bar...a lively place for sure. Country music filled the place and TV monitors showed the latest music videos on CMT. The second thing i noticed about this place was some of the male waiters were hot. :P A big plus for me.  I started off with a drink, and I was surprised that my drink was going to cost $15!!!!! I understood when i received my Toad sucker Pond in a huge MASON JAR! These people take their booze very seriously...it was great! When my Burger and onion rings came out to the table i was amazed to find the onion rings stacked ON TOP of my burger rather than the traditional on-the side placing. The food was exceptionally good, but the price was a bit high.   Still, I will definitely be coming here again...even if the prices are a bit high!!!",

    "text": "Let me say this first;  the food is ok, typical bar food.  The prices are a little high but it is Vegas you have to expect that.  Now let me say this;  We went there two times during our most recent trip to Vegas, and both times we ran into problems with the staff.  The first trip we were a party of four.  There were several empty tables but we were told it was a 20 minute wait.  I said \"really?  But there are many empty tables\": to which the hostess replied quite nastily: \"that's right\" and then walked away without taking our name for the list.  As we were ready to walk out she came back, took our names and 15 minutes later we were seated.  We waited 10 minutes for a waitress to take our drink order, then another 15 for her to take our dinner order.  The food was ok, not great not bad.  Now, three days later I went down to get a bowl a soup because I was not feeling well.  I was seated right away, but again waited 10 minutes for a waitress; let me say there were only two other people in the restaurant.  The big problem with Mr. Keith's restaurant is he need to hire nicer, more professional, and more efficient staff.  Do try the chicken and dumpling soup though;  it was very Grandma's home made soup.",

My only gripe is that for a country bar, you figure there'd be more beers on draft. Only two; miller lite and coors lite. Bummer!  The nachos weren't bad! I got a semi, but it wasn't a full on rager. Not top quality, but good enough for 3 stars.   For my entree, I got a chicken wrap that sounded great in theory... deep fried buffalo chicken, onion, guacamole, lettuce, tomato. Too much lettuce, not enough chicken, but the flavor combination was there. Next time I go back, I'll ask for extra chicken in there... then it'll be delicious.  Our waitress Michelle was stunning. My family is ridiculous, so we had a discussion on whether or not her tits were real. I watch a ton of porn and my mother has fake boobs... we both voted real. My dad didn't care, he just wanted to stare at them.   Also, the waitresses wear assless chaps. Thumbs up.",

    "text": "If I could rate this place with zero stars I would.    I don't understand why there are so many positive reviews. This place is a dump.    To begin with, I tried to call the restaurant several times during the week after noon and no one answered.  Finally, they answered.  I just wanted to see if there were any happy hour specials. Geez...  I met up with some girls to start up the evening for a bachelorette party on a Saturday evening.  Not everyone showed up at the same time, so the hostess would not seat us until the entire party was there. (We had 10 girls in our party.)  They also have a sign that says that there is a 90 minute maximum at your table.  Oh yea....they don't take reservations either.  Not to mention 2 of the hostesses were rude and I had to pull answers out of them.  Already not having a great experience, because there is NO level of customer service in this place.    The drinks are expensive....$7 for a corona light.  Yes, it's the strip but at Harrah's that seems a bit crazy.  Maybe I should have splurged for the $22 mason jar, but I was the DD and didn't want to get crazy.  Every so often, they blow a whistle or something and someone jumps on the bar to pour some shots into your mouth.    Once we sat down, I asked the server if my sister and I could split our bill out.  She made sure to tell us they only split checks a max of 3 ways.  OK what is with this place...can't I catch a break?!  All in all...she ended up splitting the check 4 ways....funny how that worked out.    The service was OK and the food was not so great.  Typical strip food....over priced and under delivered.  We only had bar type food...nacho plates, club sandwich and I shared an app platter. The best thing was the fried mac n cheese balls. Not super great but good.  Later that evening about 3 hours after I ate....I had food poisening. Yes, like Linda Blaire!  I am sure it was the chicken wings.  I will be contacting Harrah's and the health department.  I didn't drink so it wasn't that.  All in all...not a place I would EVER go back to.",

If you stay in Harrah's, it's very tempting after you've spent all day on your feet. The prices are similar to an Applebee's except for the booze. On busy nights, the bartender will stand on the bar and pour shots into everyone's mouths. I wouldn't do it because a) germs! and b) it was a mysterious orange liquid that probably wasn't gin.  The food was adequate. The fried mac and cheese pleased our group and I liked the fried twinkies. But nothing stood out as something I'd end up craving back home.  They only run the mechanical bull Thursday through Saturday nights, but they made an exception for our group (it helps to be a dozen 21+ girls, I suppose). I was the first to ride it that night, but after watching gross chicks grind against it ('That's not a good way to stay on...' I thought to myself), I think maybe I don't want strange crotch sweat on me? Maybe not. Well, Chippendales crotch sweat is fine, but Toby Keef place crotch sweat, no.",

They come with either ranch or bleu cheese dressing, and they are a great twist to the traditional mozzarella sticks.  The mason jars are on the expensive side, avg. $19, but they are big and last a while. They have good burgers, and yummy crispy steak fries, and almost every meal is a little over-sized.   My biggest gripe is the service, all of the hostess' and waitress' are women, and many of them are snotty. First off, they are walking around with chaps and their asses hanging out, that might be one of the reasons for their uptight attitude, and they can be very rude. The most recent time my husband and I came here with my in-laws, our waitress was horrible. She never cracked a smile, rammed into my purse almost knocking it down (it was hanging on my chair and she didn't apologize or even look back), and she forgot my mother-in-law's drink because, \"oh, uh, someone just handed me back there check and I haven't had a chance to pick up your drink from the bar.\" Have someone else run it for you half wit! She's lucky my father-in-law paid, because I would not have left her sour-puss face 1 red cent. Don't like your job? Your ass is cold? Find another one, don't take it out on the customers tipping you=common sense. If I didn't like those cheese sticks so much, I'd probably never come back. I'll most likely sit at the bar from now on, because the bartender's are usually a little nicer then the last 2 waitress we've had the displeasure of having.",

    "text": "In honor of an upcoming trip to Vegas, I thought I'd review some of my most and least favorite places in the town. This place tops the \"least favorite\" list by a long shot.  Hey, maybe I'm just not the crowd this place is looking for. I thought I would be, because I'm a HUGE country music fan, and even admit to a grudging appreciation of/liking for Toby Keith's music. Which is good, because you can't look around the bar without seeing a zillion pictures of the guy. So if you disagree with his right-wing views and occasionally racist song lyrics, this probably isn't the place for you.  HOWEVER, if you like paying $8 for an aluminum bottle of Bud Light, this is definitely the place for you. I'd question your intelligence, because cheaper (or free) beer is readily available in Las Vegas, but hey. If you like artery-hardening fried food that claims to be \"Southern\" by virtue of its being fried, this is definitely the place for you.** And most importantly, if you like your meal to be interrupted at random intervals by ear-piercing whistles, music volume suddenly cranked to 11, and sadly unattractive (and fully clothed, but maybe that's a relief) male bartenders dancing and cavorting on the bar, well then, this is DEFINITELY the place for you. Have at it.  **Grudgingly, I have to admit that the fried mac and cheese was pretty tasty, if I recall correctly.",

The drink here were very weak and very over priced even for Vegas. The food although it was good it took forever to get to the table and all we ordered was appetizers. The band that was playing was pretty good but when they weren't playing the dj was playing nothing but hip hop and techno which killed the mood. I though the dj would actually play country and a bar owned by a country legend.",

Despite your valiant attempt to get me to buy a jar of booze, I didn't feel like getting wasted when I had to fly 13 hours later).  The floor was sticky almost everywhere near the bar.  And even though it was only 10pm, some drunk moron dropped his drink on the ground and walked away.  No big deal right? Now you'd think a waitress would get a mop and clean it up.

When I asked the waitress what kind of beer they had on tap and she said \"Busch.\"  I stared back at her, waiting, hoping to coax another selection out of her, but she was done with her list.  We were in it for the full experience of drinking out of a mason jar, so we were stuck with Busch.  We looked at menu items such as \"Star Spangled Salad\" and \"Knock Yourself Out\" Nachos before settling on the equally healthy fried Mac and Cheese.  The order arrived with four or five large sized brown balls.  They were a little too hot to pick up, so we cut into them with a fork and knife.  The taste was pretty good, but I recommend you share it with someone unless you hate your heart.  During our visit there was a live country band playing as people danced.  The bartenders were up and about doing all sorts of drink pouring tricks the entire time.  It seemed like a place that could get pretty rowdy, but it was very tame that night.

I had called a week before to make a reservation for 12, because their website said they recommend reservations for 12 or more.  However, I talked to the manager and she said, they wouldn't be taking reservations because that weekend because of March madness and her suggestion was to come an hour early and put my name on a list.  So, I did just that, however, I was told by the hostess that she couldn't hold a table for me or seat me until all of my party is there.  Wish the manager would have told me that when I called.  No communication between management and staff and that's why they get poor ratings.    Basically, if you're going to have a large party in your group, call ahead of time and get details of reservations, seating requirements, etc. before you arrive.    It was a frustrating experience and I won't go there again with a large party.",

Tip them well and they will take good carfe of you (they even charged my phone because the battery was dead) I love this place and wish I was there right now.  All in all...If you like Toby and like to drink from a mason jar, I recommend this place. If you want to have crazy country fun, I recommend this place. If your old or  if your yound young, they dont discriminate, I recommend this place. But, dont come here expecting gourmet foods or any fancy crap because you will be disappointed.",

We waited 15 minutes for a table,10 minutes to order a drink, and another 10 minutes to order our food, and about 30 minutes to get it. We kind of expected some delay due to the fact it was so busy. We ordered the brisket knock yourself out nachos, and fried pickles. Both made to perfection and hot. We had them put all the spicy stuff to the side which they did. Your drinks come in mason jars, and the decor is very fitting for country. Our waitress Michelle was very helpful and got our order perfect. All the staff was friendly and happy. We ended up taking my parents back a few days later. This time it was not busy, but we still had a wait due to them only having 2 servers. Our waitress this time was Rhonda. Very friendly and helpful and again got our order just right. We again had the nachos and pickles, but also ordered the western burger. It was a big burger and made ot perfection. The fries were great and not too salty, and they do not scrimp on the sauces. Other than the wait, we had a great time and would go back again.",

    "text": "Okay first off this review is only for the Superbowl party,  not the normal operations of this bar.  I go to Las Vegas at least twice year, and I go to Toby Keith's every time we are down in Vegas and we never had a bad time there.  Always has good live music playing during the night, even got to see Toby Keith sing one time.  This was the third time we have gone to Toby Keith's for their Superbowl party.  Got in line to get time at around 10am like last year.  Doors opened at noon.  First noticed that they didnt arrange the tables into long rows like they did in the past, but whatever a lot of places leave their restaurant area tables alone during special events.  We took a table in the of the restaurant area because there were five of us in the group.  The screen that we had seemed smaller that what was there last year but that could have been just due to how much further away to it we were.  The buffet was the same as years past, decent nothing to write home about. Now the reason I am writing this review.  The service was ... hmm, I cannot come up with the best word to describe how bad it was.  As part of the package you get 4 bottles of either Coors Light or Miller Light.   I would have drank way more than that in the coarse of the 6 and half hours we were there.   Between the time we sat down to half-time (about 4 hours) I had 4 beers.  I ordered a beer every time our waitress came by.   Yes I am saying in 4 hours we got checked on 4 times.  This whole time I am watching the tables around us get checked on by their waitresses multiple times and even asked a few to help us for absent waitress.    A little way into the third quarter our waitress returns to us to tell us that she needs to close out as its the end of her shift.  Okay fine.  Lets hope the next one will check on us more.... not really sure there was ever was anyone else assigned to our table because it wasn't till the fourth quarter I finally complained to a \"manager\" about the lack of service.  He said he would take care of this.  Sweet, a new waitress showed up took our next round.... And we didnt see her again.  So at this point Toby Keith's will not be seeing us next year as we will be at a different Casino's Superbowl party.",

    "text": "Do not even ask me how we ended up here to finish out the bachelorette party - but we did.   I am *not* a lover of Country music. At all. So this was not exactly my favorite, but the plus side was that there were more than enough empty tables at 1am on a Friday night for our entire group of 15 people to sit down at.   They've got a country band who I assume does mostly Toby Keith covers (like I know anything about it), but the highlight was when the lead singer donned a crazy shaggy wig and they played Neil Diamond's \"Sweet Caroline\" while the audience sang along. That was the best part of being there, in my opinion.   I didn't order a drink here, but it looked like they served everything in HUGE mason jars (how COUNTRY of them) - so I'd say if you love everything country, you'll probably love this bar & grill even if I didn't. ;)",

I am a business executive and I travel to Vegas about 5 times per year over the last 10 years or so.  I stumbled into Toby Keith's about 5 years ago, and I can honestly say it is the one place I look forward to going to every trip.  It doesn't disappoint.  It feels like home even though I'm from the O.C. and I'm not a huge Country fan.  My man Jay Bird has always made the experience fun at the bar.  He's a great guy to have a laugh with.  He makes drinks with this whole flair process with bottles and tumblers and glasses flyin' every which way before it all lands cleanly in your glass.  Very entertaining.  I usually go here in the evening, but this week I decided to have lunch here.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, Mac & Cheese balls, and the tortilla soup.  In the background, I was entertained by Toby Keith's mostly hilarious music videos.  Food came reasonably fast.  The food was really good. Unexpectedly good.  I washed that down with a mason jar of my favorite beverage and I felt like I had great experience for a reasonable value.",

The bartenders looked right at me and were just busy in their own conversations and horsing around.  It took another 40 mins to get another beer. To top everything off, the IDIOT bartender LEO had ear plugs in, and would start just holloring like he was having a stroke or something and then start just banging on the bar with stuff or slamming the door into the wall to make noise.  Dude, if you dont like country music, take your ignorant ass somewhere else and work.  You ruined the experience for everyone at the bar that was there to LISTEN TO COUNTRY MUSIC AT A COUNTRY MUSIC ARTISTS BAR... you're a moron!

The hostess was polite and great but our waitress took our order and never came back. We'd try to wave her down and although she wasn't busy and was cheerfully serving other customers, she made faces the 3 different times we interacted. We asked for drinks, she practically rolled her eyes when we told her we wanted water. She came back to take our order and the bus boys and runners took care of everything else. We waited forever to get our tab and when we asked for it she practically rolled her eyes AGAIN. Did we not fit the profile of people she normally likes to serve? Aside from our horrible waitress, the food was bland and extremely disappointing. The ribs and meatloaf were both so bad we ate less than half and DID NOT take leftovers. Even if we had wanted to, my mother felt shame asking for a to go box to avoid further interactions with the waitress. God bless the bus boy and hostess who redeemed this restaurant even a bit. I expected much better after having stayed 5 nights at Harrah's.",

I went up and talked to a guy, I said I am Paul but a party of 4.  He said \"I was just testing you\", really that tells me you can not take the right number down.  They seated us immediately telling me that they are not managing their tables correctly.  Our waitress was good but had to ask for our player cards back, they should been in the bill folder or given back when associated with the bill.  Future - Maybe if they have a good house band.",

    "text": "Had lunch here the other day and was very disappointed. My mom used credit from Total Rewards to pay for our meal and I believe we got taken.  I got the turkey club and shared with my wife, who got the Cesar salad. My club had dry turkey, barely crisp bacon and tough toast. Not to mention no mustard, mayo or other sauce to lubricate it down. Disappointing.  My wife's salad had the ends of the romaine in the salad. It was dressed well, but lacked any seasoning. Just ok.  My brother in law found a piece of paper towel in his chicken fried steak. Yuck! The topper was that my little girls mac and cheese was grainy and an odd orange. She lives on boxed Mac and cheese but this was just un edible.  Toby, I was embarrassed for you.",

Originally, I wasn't going to stop but I saw the special pricing and decided to stop in. Several hours later, I had a nice buzz and my bank account hadn't taken a massive hit like other Vegas establishments did. I'm not normally a big Blue Moon drinker but $4.50 for 2 mason jar (32oz) drinks was a deal I don't think I could find anywhere else.  I think a lot of others thought the same thing and as a result there was one bartender running around trying to service the whole place. The service took longer than average and I had to ask where my appetizer was since it had taken so long.   Overall, I did enjoy my experience but I think they could benefit by having a bit more coverage in the bar area.",

    "text": "With some great reviews and some \"not to great\" ones, we thought we would give it a try since we were staying at Harrah's anyway.  Since some of our experience was great and some not so much, I have decided on 3-1/2 stars.  The visit didn't start off so well.  We were told that we would have about a 10 minute wait.  No big deal at all, we just went next door to the gift shop. We were literally there for 5-6 minutes and made the 5 second trek back to the restaurant.  The  hostess informed us that she had called our name and had to give our table away and that we would have to go back on the \"list\".  Again, no problem, since it was later in the evening and it didn't seem busy in the slightest.    At this point I would like to insert my opinion on the Hostess.  I truly believe that this person had something against smiling.  You would think that the business owner would want the first person that customers would come in to contact with would be a friendly, helpful person who appears to enjoy what they do.  To represent the brand in a positive way.  I expected a lot better, Toby!    When we were led to our table, it was a little surprising that the place was less than half full.  As I mentioned, it was later in the evening but the Hostess made it seem as though it was packed!  Anyway, the food was a highlight, and since this is a restaurant, I guess that is what was most important!  We had the Brisket Nachos.  They were amazing!  My boys both had Bronco Burgers and they were HUGE!  They both loved them.  I had the Texas Cheesesteak.  It was good but not great in my opinion.  It was pretty soggy, but tasted pretty good.    I would go back, if only for those Nachos!  I am sure that the atmosphere is much better around dinner time.  It was pretty laid back at the time we went.  Hopefully the Hostess was just having a bad day.",

You can order your drink in a mason jar for $19. Seems pricey, but considering most drinks in Vegas are about $12 this is a really good deal.   Every time I go there is a fun band playing, and in between sets the DJ will play a mix of music (not just country.) If you are lucky enough you will be there on a night where locals lead line dancing.   Overall this is a really fun place and my favorite spot in Vegas.",

The waitress was friendly, and recommended a few items from the menu. I ordered her #1 choice of a fried bologna sandwich with french fries. The sandwich was completely saturated in grease. It's a grilled sandwich so I expected it to have some grease, but this was absurd. I ate about three bites. My boyfriend ordered fish and chips and it, too was covered in so much grease it was not edible. Needless to say we paid a hefty price for heartburn and stomach aches for the rest of the day. We will not be returning. If I had to recommend one thing, it would be to save your money and eat at the deli in Harrah's.",

    "text": "I loved this restaurant so much we ate dinner here 2 nights out of the 3 we were in Vegas. We stayed at The Cosmopolitan and we walked late the first night so it wasn't terribly hot all the way to Harrah's stopping to watch the cool sidewalk shows and random attractions of people.Then we walked the second  time in the early evening when it was about 107 out all the way to Harrah's again! Ridiculous walk! But worth it. Plus right outside of Harrah's there is a outside bar/club Carnaval I think it was called and they have a booth that makes enormous drinks for about 40$ and we got one of those to keep us company. ;)  Good food, excellent service, great fun atmosphere. At first I was hesitant to go to a country based bar since that's never really been my cup of tea, but to my surprise, I had a great time! On Saturday night there was a live band singing cover songs, they did an excellent job! The woman could really sing! There were people swing dancing and line dancing all over. It was a good time. Our waitress was the little blonde woman, she had so much energy and was the sweetest cutest waitress ever. She rocked the heck out of her butt-less chap outfit with the rhinestone booty shorts! My husband and I ordered a hamburger and a quesadilla and split the two. Food was good. We also got the mason jar of the Georgia Peach. It was good, but a little bit too sweet for me.   The second night (Sunday night) there was no live band, must be a Saturday only thing. We ordered Toby's Big Daddy Platter. It was delicious. I have never had deep fried macaroni and cheese balls, not sure if I would ever particularly order it but I loved it from there! I got a Ranch House salad (which was huge for the price). Don't remember exactly what my husband ordered but he loved it. We also got the boot souvenir drink cup this time filled with The Patriot I believe. We asked for the least sweet tasting one on the menu and it was delicious. Got to take the boot home back to California.   This is a fun place for all ages! I will definitely come here again when I take another trip to Vegas. I forgot to mention this place is pretty affordable, the drinks were strong and fairly priced and the food was decently priced and you got a lot of it!!",

The waitress had to take a large table order immediately after. She messed up our order so we had to eat in stages. Then the manager came over and didn't want to make it up to us. So we overpaid for two sandwiches, our meal was ruined, and we just had to deal with it?! No we finally got the difficult manager to take care of part of the meal but it shouldn't have been this hard. Start to finish the service was awful. The food wasn't good either.

A friend of mine from NYC (whose father is an executive with Caesars Entertainment, the parent company of Harrah's) decided to use family connections for his birthday dinner...and we all got an invitation that the dinner was to be held at Toby Keith's. Wait, what? I was confused to say the least and had to call other people who I knew were also invited before we figured out what and where Toby Keith's was.  This place reminds of my college days at the University of Arizona in Tucson: cowboy hats, country music and lots of Jack Daniels bottles used as decoration. There was live music and the main singer looked like a skinnier Toby Keith. The restaurant was loud and our waitresses handled our large (and mostly obnoxious, though in good fun) party very well.  As for the food, I ordered the \"hottie wrap\" which is a sun dried tomato tortilla filled with strips of fried chicken (I know, not part of my usual diet but with all the Jack Daniels decorations around I felt fried anything was appropriate somehow) and lots of veggies. My guilty conscience made me ask for fat free ranch instead of bleu cheese. The wrap tasted fresh and everyone enjoyed their food. Orders ranged from burgers, to wings, to mac & cheese.  I'm not going to lie, our party of 20 people had an awesome time. Everything was on the house so needless to say the drinks were flowing. I didn't partake in any of the speciality cocktails because they all come in giant mason jars. I wanted something a little daintier. Oh, and to make things interesting some man (in hindsight I pray it was the bartender) came around with a bottle and gave everyone in our party (guys and girls) shots. The atmosphere was very fun and it was a great birthday dinner setting for a loud group.",

All the flavours meshed together wonderfully...I've never met a reuben with coleslaw instead of sauerkraut that I didn't like!  Bacon added a nice touch and a little extra crispiness.  It almost made me want to ride the mechanical bull out of sheer excitement but that will have to wait for another day.  Service was friendly and (at lunch time) quite fast.   And the waitresses all wear short shorts (sometimes with chaps) if you are into that sorta thing.",

Normally on the strip everything is over priced and afterwards you feel you didn't get your money's worth.   We were sat right away, ordered within couple minutes. The water was tap water and I can honestly say that was the only downer, buy a water filter for the sinks.  Our entrees came out quickly and by Vegas standards were delicious.   I highly recommend doing lunch here",

I am not a light weight by any means when it comes to drinking but after 1 1/2 of those drinks and a bar sweat shot I was done for. Not that I'm complaining one bit because it resulted in a fun evening with the hubby ;) and the bartenders made sure my hubby could get me home which was nice.   I have no comment on the food as we only drank there. The bartenders were fun and charismatic and made killer drinks.   Only downside is the fact that the location is horrible. We almost gave up looking for it because it was so far deep within the hotel. Otherwise if you are looking for a fun, relaxing bar to get your drink on I recommend taking the trek through the hotel to find it.",

    "text": "Came to TK's only because I go to the one in Rancho Cucamonga, Ca and as you can see from that review. I really LOVE that place. However, I was super dissapointed when I came to Vegas 2 weeks ago--7/27/13. I didn't want to make a review without speaking to the manager on duty about the situation (hoping something would be done about it. It wasn't.)  My party of 3 came here on Saturday night around 10 o'clock to eat. We were promptly told our wait was going to be around 10-15 minutes. Around the 20 minutes wait mark we noticed some tables available yet we weren't seated. I went up to the hostess and she said that they were waiting for tables to be bussed and clean. I dont get it. I could see in plain view 2 tables available. an extra 5 minutes passed and we were finally seated. At this point I was just glad to be at a table and I quickly got over the prior hiccup. My cousin and I decided to order our drinks and food as soon as our waitress came by (2 waters and a lemonade. Nothing difficult. Plus 2 bbq salads. No brainer.) My other cousin had run to the bathroom and we told her she could put in the orders in right way. No need to wait.  Kelly, greeted us and took our order. 20 minutes passed and we didn't even get our drinks. This particular night at TK's was steady NOT busy. Not a moment after she took our order my other cousin reappeared and we told him our situation. He was quite surprised that we hadn't received our drinks yet (he works at a resturant and informed us that there shouldn't be any reason why it should take that long. 7 minutes at the very least to get our drinks and a total of 20 minutes to get our meals.) We finally got our order after 15 minutes. So, we waited 35 minutes total for 2 salads. :-/  At this point I was quite upset at the service that was given to us. I managed to track down one of the girls (our waitress was MIA) and asked her to send the manager to our table. The manager emerged from a back room which I could only assume was a banquent/party room. I told him our situation and he seemed to understand me or, so I thought. He told us he was going to get our waitress and NEVER came to our table to check up on us. Wow, the longer we stayed the more I hated being there. We didn't feel like we were taken care of at all.   Kelly managed to shortly appear after we talked to the manager and told us that she had a mix up with a drink order with a larger party. It isn't difficult to take a drink order. You go around the table from person to person. She didn't apologize for the wait. Maybe because she assumed the problem wasn't her fault???!?! Nevertheless, we asked for our check so we wouldn't have to wait for it later. We honestly couldnt wait to get out of there to at which we decided to give our business to Gilley's at Treasure Island.   SIDENOTE: We weren't expecting TK's to comp a meal if the manager and or Kelly took better care of us. We would have been fine paying for what we ordered. However, I won't be dining here next time I'm in town.   -----  I do however give credit where credit is due and we were at TK's the night before this night and we had a good time, AT THE BAR. The boys were great and we got our drinks in a timely manner. It may not have been as steady as Saturday but even with the visits we had here prior I have always had a good time at the BAR. So, do yourselves a favor if you dine here. Sit at the bar and order from the bartenders! They seem like they know what they're doing!",

It's very rare for a place to mess up nachos.  I mean.... how can you mess up nachos? Well they succeeded in this.  Neither of us liked it.  There wasn't a good flavor at all.  You can choose chicken or beef.  We chose beef.  Little did we know it was a shredded beef and not a ground beef.  The beef was dry and cold.  Our friend was highly disappointed in his meal as well.  Again, no flavor in country fried steak.  Bummer.  Please trust me and skip this place.",

There was a larger party seated after us and from that point on, our server seemed to forget any of us even existed (another couple across from us couldn't get his attention either). Ended up having to track down a manager just to get our check and some carryout containers.  In addition to that, it's incredibly dark in there, so much so that even reading the menu was hard to pull off without pressing it to your face.  Also, why are all the female servers seemingly required to wear either backless chaps with their panties completely visible or way too short shorts? Not sure who at corporate made that call, but here's a tip: Let the food be your reason to be there, not some pointless lowbrow nonsense like that.  Honestly, if this was a standalone place outside of a casino, it wouldn't last long with all these issues.",

    "text": "I came here twice while in Vegas for the weekend; mostly because I was staying at Harrah's. The first night we went in around 1-2 am and there was a live band playing. The service at the bar was very good and fast - but a 16oz beer is $13.50 which is pretty expensive even for Vegas. The rest of the night was fun, my girlfriend and I danced to the band and had a good time.   Now the next day was a different experience. We came to get some lunch around 1pm and we were seated quickly and our waitress was friendly and the service was fast. BUT, I ordered the steak sandwich medium-rare and it came out bleeding red. I ate a few bites of the sandwich but that was it - way too bloody to eat any more. The sandwich came with fries but I was so turned off by the sandwich that I barely ate any of those. When the waitress asked how everything was I told her about how the sandwich was way too bloody and she told her manager about it. The manager came over and said \"I heard your steak sandwich was too bloody, is there anything I can do?\" I told her that I hadn't paid my bill yet and so she told me she could discount it. Before she left I asked her if she saw the sandwich and she said no, but \"I talked to the chef and he said that it was way too bloody.\"   So the chef sent out a sandwich that he knew wasn't cooked correctly, and then the manager only took $3 off of the sandwich/fries meal that was almost $20 and I had only eaten a few bites - after she admitted they messed up the order.  You would assume they would take the item off of the bill, but no.   To top it all off, I asked for an extra pickle spear because that was the only thing that I actually ate that came with my meal and got charged for it.   But the beer was cold.",

Four total pickle spears for $8.  Then we moved to dinner, there was four of us eating and we all ordered medium. The burgers were all well done. Didn't expect for a $17.00 burger that it would come out well done when we ordered medium. The only good part was the fries. Oh and if you want to add bacon is a $2.00 charge....   Keep in mind for a bottle beer it's around $8 and for a draft, mason jar beer is $13.   So for two people to eat we spent $80.00 for a not so great meal....... not worth it for the price!!   Definitely wish we had waited in line for a highly rated $30 buffet within the same casino area!",

The entrees were definitely the best part of the meal, I got a chicken quesadilla that had green chile on it and it was actually decent. Others enjoyed their wraps and burgers.

If you have a total rewards card, there are special prices for each menu item and I believe it takes $1 off each item which is great. We just wanted something quick so we ordered the bbq wings and fried pickles. The bbq wings were delicious, they were big wings and smothered in bbq with some extra on the bottom. For $12 though, it was pricey for 8 wings but hey, when in Vegas! The fried pickles were decent but nothing too special. The other items on the menu didn't look too bad but definitely overpriced for most items like ribs and fries even with a discount.   The customer service was good but she was a bit slow. We waited at the table for 5-7 minutes just to be acknowledged by someone and get some water that tasted like tiolet. Then we had to wave her down to get napkins and later on for the check since she never came to our table. It was not very pleasing to the eye when the girls are a little bit bigger and they are wearing booty shorts that show half their butts. Just saying. Besides that, the food was decent. I'm not a country music fan, but I knew and heard of Toby Keith before. It was funny seeing him everywhere with pictures of himself posing on the walls and basically a shrine to myself throughout the place. Theres also a gift shop next door, probably overpriced also but I didn't get a chance to go in.   I would say skip this place unless you're only getting the wings!!!",

Their was barely any visible bacon or cheese and MAYBE a teaspoon of sour cream on the \"loaded\" tater tots. The mac & cheese balls were okay but nothing to write home about. We laughed at how large the mason jars were for our sodas were until we received the bill and they were $5 a piece...I'd have rather had a smaller cup for half the price.

We sat at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and attentive. The menu is interesting. The Cowboy Ruben sandwich I ordered was really good. And there was pretty good live entertainment. We had a good time. Good enough that we went back for lunch (pretty good soups and salads) the next day before heading home.  This is not a 5 star restaurant. It is a bar and grill and if you go in with the right attitude I think you may be pleasantly surprised.  Can't say we loved it but we certainly liked this bar and grill.

Take your money and spend it at Ramsey's pub and grill. Been here for an hour and I had to get the servers attention for my ONE drink, to order, and as I write this I still haven't gotten my bill.. I'm a total Rewards member and I gambled on the video poker machines and still no love. I was ready to spend money and the service was subpar. Barring Toby Keith sitting with me for a beer, I'll probably never come back. Take your money elsewhere folks.",

    "text": "Well, it was Restaurant Week again, and I finally experienced Toby Keith's vaunted World Famous Fried Bologna Sandwich, with a really thick slab of fried bologna joined with American Cheese and Miracle Whip on grilled Texas Toast.  It was so slippery that the slice of bologna inside one sandwich half slid right out when I tried to raise it to my lips, flew in the air, and skidded to a stop on the floor at my feet.  My waitress graciously got the chef to provide a quick replacement half at no additional charge, along with another long pickle spear.  Speaking of pickles, greasy and juicy battered Fried Pickles were a great appetizer dipped in refreshing pink Ranch Dressing.  Red, white and blue tortilla chips with a tasty mild salsa were good but cold.  Regardless of color, the chips tasted the same.  Visible egg and crunchy celery enhanced a side of potato salad which had a pleasurable tang.    A half-pound \"American Soldier\" Burger with Cheddar Cheese with Freedom Fries was made perfectly medium rare as ordered.  And a warm Southern Fried Twinkie, accompanied by whole strawberry pieces and sweet whipped cream, was a toothsome treat--much better than an unfried Twinkie.  Service by our scantily clad cowgirl was excellent, and all beverages were served in unconventional mason jar-like containers.  This time 4-1/2 stars overall!",

I got the sloppy joe, can't mess up on sloppy joe so it was pretty good. A little on the dry side but flavor was there so that made up for it. Received a huge portion of fries which was surprising but made the $14 plate worth it.   Atmosphere was pretty nice, music was great.

The wait staff is also one of the best in the city.  At the end of my experience, I always find myself echoing Toby's words, I love this bar!  As for food, I've had the fried bologna sandwich, and a few other of the sandwiches.  They come hot and delicious out of the kitchen with \"freedom fries.\"  The freedom fries were some of the best I've had.  Also I tend to drink a lot of soda and my glass was never empty thanks to the amazing waitresses!    The entertainment- the dance floor is never empty, even between sets as the house music tends to get at least a few people on the floor.  Then the band comes back and it kicks into high gear.  The bands take requests and even though it is a Country music bar, I've heard them cover Rock and Pop hits as well.    If you're not having a good time by the time you leave, I'm not sure Vegas is for you.  Hopefully you'll try it and find out you too love this bar!",

The band, Tony Marques Band, is great, but their 2nd set was mostly U2, Uptown Funk, Funkytown, etc.  Not what you would expect from a band at a country western club.  That being said, we still love listening to the band.  We sat at the bar and J.J. was our bartender.  She is awesome.  Very personable and outgoing.  Fun to watch.  When my wife and I went out to dance, we returned to the bar and found that she had taken a napkin and wrote, gone dancing' on the napkin and hung it over our beers so that no one would take our spot at the bar.  We can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "If you have a choice DON'T DINE HERE. Toby Keith I HATE YOUR BAR & GRILL.   I would rather stay home and get a third degree burn in my mouth from a Lean Pocket than ever dine at this type of place, but sometimes it's not about what I want.   It was my sister's birthday and her and my mother love country music and Toby Keith in particular. My mom had mentioned she wanted to take my sister here so I took the bull by the horns and made it happen. Big mistake.  We all know there are outstanding restaurants on the strip that are worth every over priced dime that you spend. Not this one. This falls into the other category. The Over Priced Food That Just Sucks Themed Restaurants.  Still, I can get past the price just to make people I love happy, but not this time. In a nutshell.  The food wasn't terrible. My sister ordered meatloaf potato skins with gravy for our appetizer. This was creative, yet under seasoned, but still I was thinking this would be cool to recreate at home for one of my dinner parties. Maybe with sweet potatoes.  Next we each had a sandwich which does not include fries and my sister added fries. My sandwich was a grilled BBQ chicken sandwich which wasn't terrible at all. I could only eat half and brought the rest of the chicken home to my dog. One Coke, two well drinks and $95 LATER!!!!!!! Fuck me.  Like I said, I can get over the price, but the waitress broke my number one rule. IT WAS A BIRTHDAY AND SHE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR MY SISTER. Not that we expected a lap dance or Toby Keith to serenade us in tight jeans, but something! I made it a point to tip the busser and have her tell the waitress about the birthday (let me say those girls are the ones hustling in this joint) . The waitresses merely take your order and then hand you your check at the end. Other than that they do shit. It's all about the bussers. Our busser  was on point and I know she told the waitress. Well Sue or Suzie our blonde waitress brought me the bill and I mentioned it to her and she just looked at my sister and said, \"Happy Birthday\". I wanted to rip her Lee Press-On nails right off. Well, I tipped her accordingly and then tipped the busser again.  If mediocre, overpriced, under seasoned bar food and country music is your thang than you will be in hog heaven with the trailer park beauties servin' it up. If you are looking to spoil someone you love on their birthday with a simple scoop of vanilla ice-cream and a feckin' candle than do not come here.",

Eight of us chose this place over everything else here in Vegas and it was the worst bet we made all weekend!  2 of our 8 couldnt get out of bed for 36 hours because of severe cramps and diahrhea. They each had the club sandwich.  The rest of the meals were just ok, but on a 4 day vacation to lose a full day and night is not acceptable.  This was food poisoning plain and simple.  Clearly no one associated with TK ever does any knd of quality control here. This is a great example of how not to protect your brand. The TK brand will surely be a Walmart staple before long.  The one star is for the Jack and Coke one of us had.",

Sure the walls are lined with images and items from his career, enough that part of our conversation was \"If Toby Keith were to actually come here, would he be super embarrassed by how much this place is a shrine to him or would he own it and purposefully wear an outfit from one of the photos and get the table underneath said photo?\" In all seriousness, the decor was a little overdone. Unlike, say, Margaritaville, which I would say is \"Parrothead- and Jimmy-Buffet's-MUSIC-themed,\" I Love This Bar is simply \"Toby Keith-themed,\" which is a bit off-putting. It's like the cafeteria of the Toby Keith Museum. The food and service were definitely good. My burger was well-cooked and tasty, and the service was fine. It was a little strange that they took and then tried to sell us a souvenir photo of us at our table. As always the food was forced-pun titled. The music was of course a mix of new and old country, which I was fine with. I'll come back to this place, but only if I was with someone else who wanted to go. It wouldn't be my recommendation.",

This was one of the worst dining experiences we ever had.  We were seated right away but waited close to 15 minutes before anyone arrived to take our order. Because of this we put in our drink and food order right away. It took another 25 minutes for our food to come out as others, who were seated after us, were being served.  The grilled chicken wrap had very little chicken but was overflowing with lettuce. There was no avocado as the menu had said and was way too creamy.  The hamburger my girlfriend ordered tasted like a frozen hamburger patty and was unusually sloppy. She also ordered fries with an extra side of coleslaw. She was only served the coleslaw and then the server tried to charge us extra for it.  Overall it was a horrible experience. Its unfortunate as we know other Toby Keith locations to have good food and service. If you're ever in Chicago (specifically Rosemont) check out that location.",

After walking into a few very expensive bars, I suggested Toby Keith's I love this bar and grill not only because I love Toby Keith BUT i also LOVE country music!   Once we walked in, I knew it was going to be great night! They were playing dance music during the intermission of a live country band! Their drinks were in mason jars, and the beer was only $8 served in a HUGE mason jar! I ordered a round of drinks and our bartender was extremely friendly When I ordered my 2nd round of shots, I engaged in a coversation with mr.bartender who asked what we were doing in vegas all the way from HI. I told him about my friends bday and he did this fun red yellow green 7 shot pour and gave it to us for free! Then he asked me if I wanted to try! Of course I shouted HELL YESS! Most fun ever!   Pro:  Great customer service Inexpensive drinks Great music (live and dj) Clean  Con: bathroom is located outside of the bar (right next door)",

Special drinks were good. I had the fish and chips. Nice fresh fish. Done well, not too greasy at all. Wife had the shrimp po' boy. She loved it, with fried green tomatoes. She had the whisky girl and just the perfect amount of sweetness and alcohol. I had The Patriot and loved it. Nice amount of Jim Beam. We had the fried ouch lea for an appetizer. Long spears and fried well. The ranch dip is mild but refreshing. Also, nice to listen to congruent classics in the background. Again, great food in the Harrah's. And a good gift shop attached",

I hate Toby Keith, but it was a friend's bachlorette/bachelor party and they picked the place for dinner  Despite making reservations they weren't ready for us. Our group ended up being split over two large tables of about 12ppl and one small table of 4. Not close enough for conversations between the groups.   The food was fine. Nothing amazing but not inedible. Most people had a burger, I got a chicken fried steak. Why I have no idea. It was good enough I guess.   The drinks were GOOD. Pretty much what got this to 3 stars. Granted it was $20 for one drink, but the one drink was in a 32 oz mason jar and had something like 5 shots in it.  Our waitress was great. She was nice and as quick as could be for a large party.

The manager brought it out so I think it may have been sitting in the kitchen a little long and our food came out before we were done with it.  We had the fried bologna sandwiches for dinner... I felt a little weird ordering that in a restaurant, but really - you can't get that just anywhere.  It was HUGE and filling and the drinks come in a large mason jar so you WILL fill up here though a price comes with it... this place is on the pricey side but due so such slow service, I was able to save some money on the tip so lessened it to the 15% range over 20.",

I was surprised by how much I liked the food. It was really good. I figured they go off the name and skate on the rest. I was wrong about this. The first time I was here I had the fried bologna sandwich  I liked it. I was expecting a bunch of regular thin deli Bologna but it was a thick slice grilled to perfection. I know we ordered an appetizer I think it was the wings or it came with wings the second time. I remember wings for sure. They were good but I'm not a big wing guy so they were passable but didn't wow me. I had a burger and it was good, but I expected it to be after our previous trip. Service is fine nothing to write home about. Sometimes it can be a little slow on the refills. The location in Harrah's is up stairs I the back. Way in the back. It's a bit of a haul if you're on the strip. But not bad. If you're driving to this part of he strip self park at Harrah's and you'll walk right by on you're way in. Overall a good choice when you're in Harrah's.",

This time we were here the service at the bar was really fun and prompt, we had a few mason jars of beer and an appetizer while we waited for our table.  I wish we would have just stayed at the bar!  Once we were seated it took 15 minutes for the waitress to even acknowledge us, then 40 minutes for our food to come out and my husband's pulled pork sandwich and fries were so cold I actually sent back food for the first time in my entire life.  Once it came back out it was good, and my salad with chicken was perfect.  The greens and veggies were very very cold, and the chicken was perfect.  Also, it was so large that I couldn't finish it...when is the last time that a garden salad was so big you couldn't finish it?  I really appreciated having a good size serving of a healthy option in the sea of gluttony that Vegas can be.  Overall, the atmosphere is really fun if you like country music but I would just grab a seat at the bar and eat there while you are entertained by wonderful bartenders!!",
