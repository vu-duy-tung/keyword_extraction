We were joking a lot though and I'm not sure she knew what to make of it lol.... East coast humor...the hostess also was very nice and we even shared a good laugh. The food was average. I got the shrimp and chicken wok stir fry with brown rice and it had a nice kick but overwhelming sauce compared to the balance of veggies and protein. He got the teryiaki chicken and it didn't look like your typical teryiaki chicken and must not have been too bad as he finished it all.  The atmosphere is nice as its dim and the tables aren't on top of each other. The dining area doesn't hear the noise at the bar either which is nice. We didn't do dessert or anything so it was quite simple and the best part of the evening was the company.",

I received my order of orange chicken, but it tuned out to be a beef dish. I had to send it back. After the long wait for the food, it really wasn't a great meal. The rice was warm at best, although the chicken was flavorful. After speaking with the manager and informing him about my un-satisfaction, he comped my meal,this was the saving grace. So this is why they received 3 stars, the manager saved the night and a possible future customer. I am not sure if i will go there again, there are other places that i have really enjoyed.",

As a global/wok kitchen, I already expected it to be less than good. A good restaurant, in my experience generally specializes in a style of cuisine, with the few great exceptions like Momofukos in New York. The elephant bar has a wide, imaginative menu, but the flavors are lacking. The menu sounds tasty, but doesn't live up to its description. I thought, after trying a few different meals, \"I'll try a basic dish... Macaroni and cheese.\"  They blew it. The texture of the cheese resembled that of evaporated milk. There's a better way to mix three cheeses, and its called cream. I won't be going back, unless its to try the bar.",

Better ways to approach that, considering we were a party of four and planning on ordering three rounds at the least. Bartender was at best understaffed, but I could say I'd rather pay her extra to not have to deal with her fake over pitched attempt at being cordial.   Many customers drop down from their green valley condos to stroll in for a \"neighborhood\" drink, so I'd say this bartender's bitchy blue light need to get laid attitude Is costing this restaurant a plenty.  And did I mention, no music?  Plainly put, unless you aspire to spending your evening entranced about how miserable she feels about her job, which, par for the course is mandatory, take your hard earned time and money somewhere else.  And ps; this bartender dipped her finger in my fathers beer to check if it was cold enough.  You're dead to me, skank bitch.",

The menu has a variety of items so people with different tastes should be able to choose what they'd prefer to eat easily. I've enjoyed the iceberg wedge salad, the ultimate bacon cheeseburger, and especially the seared ahi Tuna dish. I've also tried their teriyaki bowls, calamari, ceasar salad, and have had a Mai tai and a couple other cocktails here before. Price-wise it's okay, not stellar. My biggest complaint one day was when I came to watch some Sunday Football in the bar and was told they did not have the Sunday ticket which is a shame. I had to quickly eat my lunch so I could leave and go to Green Valley Ranch to watch the game I wanted to see.",

The Pub Burger at happy hour is one of the best deals anywhere- a big burger with bacon & a giant onion ring plus fries and a (domestic) draft beer for $7.95. Add $1 or $2 for an import or craft beer. Service was good, and the bartender (we ate at the bar) was friendly and even laughed at my jokes!  The happy hour menu doesn't have the rock bottom prices they used to have here. Drinks are discounted and some apps are half price. My old standby drink here, the Elephant Tea (a long island) was missing too which makes me sad. I would come back for the Pub Burger at happy hour for sure.",

    "text": "An unfortunate experience.     I visited this location on a slow Saturday afternoon, and decided to dine at the bar since I was alone.  The attending bartender was alone in the area, and only one other table of two people was in the area; they had arrived before me and had already ordered their food by the time I arrived.  I seated myself at the bar and the busy bartender announced \"I'll be with you\", as she raced about.  A few minutes later she returned with three menus and announced \"here's all the menus.  you want me to get you a drink while you're looking at them?\"   I responded \"I'm here on business.  I cant drink.\"  She disappeared.  A few minutes later, she returned and asked if I'd had any questions about the menu.  I asked a question, she answered, then began walking away.  As she was hurriedly leaving, I stopped her and announced that I was ready to order.  She took my order, printed the bill, and left it in front of me.  Odd.  I can't recall ever getting my restaurant bill BEFORE getting my food.  The hurried and distracted \"service\" continued through the meal.  I would most accurately describe the service as curt--a standard I'm not used to, living in Orlando, FL , a resort city with a rival number of dining experiences as  the greater Las Vegas area.    After my meal, I was asked if I wanted any other food.  I declined, feeling I had been unwelcomed during my stay.  I declined the offer, sharing that she had prematurely printed my invoice and had discouraged me from ordering more by doing so.  She unapologetically responded \"that's standard practice\"  I shared that it discouraged people from ordering more when you did that.  She replied \"I haven't had any problems with it\".   I was definitely taken aback by her unapologetic demeanor.   I pondered this response, as I noticed her provide a check to the table of two when they announced they were ready for the check a few moments earlier.  Overall, while the food lived up to my expectations, the service fell far short of what I've ever had at any restaurant--even other Elephant Bar locations I've visited.   Alone.  At an otherwise empty bar.  On a low traffic day.   My experience was disappointing.",

I also asked them to lower the sound of the tv bc space was limited and it was on top of the table and instead of being cool and accommodating about it, the were kind of ambivalent about it. They turned it down some bit with 9 other TVs playing the same thing and no one watching it. It seemed kinda silly to not leave it at a decent level or turn on caption on a loud crowded bar. The food was kind of bland and cold and they're was no one to complain too. The drinks were good. But no one ever came to check for a refill.",

The food so far has been outstanding. To date we've had the Beer Battered Onion Rings, which were way over salty, but other than that decent. The Tempura Salmon Rolls, which were terrific, and a nice treat to have as an appetizer without just going to a Sushi place. The Garlic Chick Alfredo was a big hit. The Pub Burgers are really great. And my personal favorite, the Caramelized Pear and Blue Cheese Burger, which is fantastic.   And the prices are really good. I'll likely stop by the restaurant sometime myself, as it looks pretty cool in the pictures.",

    "text": "Was sooooo disappointed with my recent visit. Hubby and I went on a Saturday night and ordered the following: Nachos with chicken Happy hour pub burger combo Philly cheesesteak meal Creme brulee (to go)  Never have i ever felt such sub-par service and quality of food from a well established restaurant, but this place seemed to do it so well. The nachos were overwhelmed with beans, hardly any cheese full of a bunch of broken over-oiled chips...the salsa tasted and smelled like it had turned. The bun used for the burger was some sort of wheat grain, i didn't even touch it. The cheesesteak sandwich was sloppy and the mashed potatoes so bland and forgettable. Neither of the meals looked appealing. Our waitress was non-existent and once we felt we were ready to go, we waited for almost 15min before she finally came to check on us. We really came for the creme brulee since this place was one of two places nearby that serves it. Never had it from here before but hubby was craving for it, so we ordered one to go.....and well, you can see for yourself how that unfolded,   the picture pretty much sums up our experience there. Elephant Bar is such an easy pass next time....this place is dead to me.",

    "text": "We were staying at the Green Valley Ranch Resort and we were thrilled to find this Elephant Bar.  Several locations have closed where we live and it is one of our favorite restaurant chains.  We were so pleasantly surprised by how this particular location operated.  The menu has changed, much smaller (it was too big before) but still featuring some real stand-out items.  My wife and my daughter were treated to incredible meals, I had a pistachio crusted fish sandwich that is the best fish sandwich that I have had anywhere, perfectly cooked, fresh ingredients, wonderful.  Our server was warm from the moment that she came to our table, she was attentive, kind, gave us memorable service so much so that I asked to talk to the manager about her.  Sometimes you have to let a manager or supervisor know when someone is going above and beyond and our server did in every way.  There are many restaurants in the area, let alone in Las Vegas, but on our next trip down we will be going back to Elephant Bar on the strength of this service and experience.",

Justin suggested this place because he had never been, I acquiesced, although I tried to persuade Justin not to go, because there was nothing else really open after 10 PM by where we live.   When we walked in, servers were sitting in booths eating. We stood at the hostess station for a bit until one of the servers noticed us and told us the dining room was closed but we could sit at the bar.  Okay, we showed ourselves to a table and went over the happy hour menu. We got sweet potato fries, macaroni and cheese, chicken and Justin got a hamburger for himself. The food was okay but our waitress was all over the place. She had a large table and spent most of the night yaking with the people at the table. That was pretty annoying. Justin had to go over to the bar multiple times to ask for the sauce that was supposed to come with his food, napkins, refills and when the meal was over, the check.   I guess our waitress saw him ask for the check because she came rushing over and said that \"omg, they (her customers) wouldn't shut up. SO annoying.\" That made me just feel uncomfortable because they were in earshot and, well, that's pretty unprofessional when she's leaning on the wall, talking to them, and then turns around to talk smack. Weird.   When we left, Justin said he wasn't too impressed with the food. Looks like I was right again. Save your money and head out a little earlier to some place else.",

The temperature of the food was slightly above lukewarm.  The iceberg wedge for almost $5 came from a very small head of lettuce.  The drinks were good but pricey.

    "text": "Located in The District, the Elephant Bar seems like a good place to stop off for a bite.  We walked in around 7 on a Friday night and was promptly seated.  About 10 minutes later our waitress came over and took our drink orders, I asked for kids menu since there isn't one on the regular menu.  About 10 minutes later she returns with the paper placemat of a kids menu and takes our drink order.  Another 10  minutes she returns with the drinks and asks for our order. She was quite friendly, but throughout the meal the service was SLOW.  3 kids meals and a salad and shared dessert took almost 2 hours!!  Top the molasses slow turnover time was the poor quality of the food. I ordered the Thai Chicken Salad. The chicken cubes were hard, dry and tough. The salad consisted of lettuce, loose, limp, soggy cucumber slices, bits of Chinese won ton strips,  and 3-4 julienned carrots. Two of the three kids I had with me ordered the kids hamburgers which they reported as super salty. The French fries that accompanied the burgers were good. The other child with us ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl with she said was fair, nothing spectacular. Trying to salvage the meal we ordered desserts to be shared. One ice cream (mocha) pie, huge, to be shared by 2-3 people, and very good. The chocolate chip cookie bake with a scoop of ice cream was brought severely over baked and dry. The Wonton  ice cream sundae was considered very tasty.  Total bill minus tip, $63 and change.  Service, very friendly, but very slow.  Atmosphere, clean, nice, good for families or friends.  Due to the poor quality of good I will not be returning.",

The service was very good.  The food was good as well.  The orange chicken is not what I thought it would be.  The flavor leans more towards savory (I think more soy sauce than typical sugar laden orange sauce).  It was still good, but not traditional orange chicken I get at Chinese restaurants.  When I checked in on Yelp there was a \"free dessert with entree\" pop up coupon!  Creme brulee was a traditional recipe and yummy.",

Customer Service: 5/5 Everytime we come here, we get this waiter name Joe. Joe is probably the BEST waiter I have ever seen and with a killer crazy memory too. They say elephants have amazing memories.  Hmmmm, maybe that's why he's working at a place call \"Elephant\" Bar! Wink wink!   Joe remembers my order after the 1st time around. Trust me, I am picky. My order is the Cowboy Steak with steam rice, grilled onions on the side lightly cooked, my meat medium well, no blood, diet coke and siracha, soy sauce and Tobasco sauce on the side.  Yes, he remembered all of this on my 2nd time around, holy cow, I barely can keep up with my own order. Anyway, ask for Joe, 10 Stars all the way.  Atmosphere and Cleanliness: 5/5 My opportunity to utilize the word IMMACULATE again. It is spotless and the music sound is perfect, people are nice and the place is super cozy. I can literally take a nap here.  Quality: 5/5 YUMMY for my TUMMY! Always perfectly cooked.  Everything I order is always OUTSTANDING! BEST beer battered onion rings in Town.  All onion rings should be made this way.  Quantity: 5/5 A LOT!!! It's so much, I can barely finish it no matter how hungry I am.  Price: 5/5 You know my rules, if you get perfect service and food right, nothing is overprice. Needless to say, a big piece of Steak with sides included for under $28. HELLO! No brainer, way cheaper than a lot of those fancy Steakhouse restaurants and nearly as good.  Tips:  Many people don't realize there's actually a lot of Asian dishes here. I personally think it's better than Cheesecake Factory, but with a much better environment.  Bon Appetit!",

    "text": "A nice restaurant to grab Happy Hour in the Green Valley Area.  Environment: Located at the District in Green Valley, the outside ambience is very nice. As for the interior, I have only ever sat in the bar/ lounge area, however the restaurant seems to have a nice, open floorplan with adequate interior decorating. The bar is off to the left upon entering and is designed as a circular space, with the bar in the center which is nice in that the bartenders can easily see everyone, even those sitting at the high-top tables against the walls.  Food: The menu offers a lot of variety, from grilled dishes, seafood, bar-style tapas, and Asian fusion. I have tried the tuna tataki, calamari, lettuce wraps, artichoke dip, salmon tempura roll, and potato skins. Some dishes are better than others but upon repeat visits I have been able to find a couple dishes I love despite the trial and error.   Service: Service is always good as well, even with the shorter staff available late at night for the happy hour, the bartender is always sure to be checking up on everyone and making sure that everyone's waters are refilled and asking if we would like another round of drinks.  Overall this is a great spot to grab some late night happy hour or for a quick bite before some gambling or a movie at the Green Valley Ranch Casino.",

I know a lot of food! But we enjoyed it. The only thing I didn't really like was the manager whom was at the bar with two employees. They must've switched up an order or didn't do something right because she had to \"talk to them\" about it but I was disappointed in her professionalism. There is a time and place to talk to employees about mistakes. At the bar in front of customers embarrassing them is not the place. These were the same two servers whom served us during our entire time and we were pleased with our service from them.",

Happy hour is awesome too - great selection and fair prices (love the lettuce wraps!) I have to admit it's hard for me to choose anything other than their chicken teriyaki bowl with brown fried rice - it's incredible!

    "text": "Me and Ellen F. came with a mutual friend who is a huge fan of this place, he says nothing but good things about it. The name itself jarred my curiosity, the Elephant Bar. We came at 11:30 so the place wasn't crowded at all, the host seated us right away in the back booth. Elephant Bar has an open kitchen in the back so you can see the staff prepare your food, which I don't mind.   The decor IMO was appealing and comfortable. It's a safari type theme yet very modern, old school advertisements for Africa and warm wood colored tones. When we walked in I caught a glimpse of the bar, it was circular surrounded by clear shadeless windows on all sides. The bar definitely looks like a chill drink spot, going to have to check it out sometime.  I ordered the Chicken & Shrimp Jambalaya, for $2 extra I opted for the bourbon rice instead of the white or brown option, I'm a sucker like that. To start me and Ellen F. split the chicken tortilla soup. The waitress was awesome, she actually split it up into two bowels instead of one which is a bitch to share with someone. The soup was luke warm, I like my soup hot. Although the soup was not the temperature I liked it did taste really good. Wasn't to spicy had the right amount of zest to it.  The Jambalaya was just OK, nothing real special. The rice was worth the extra $2 though. The sauce tasted like it came out of a plastic bag along with the chicken. I think it got left under the heat lamp for to long as it had that dry film-like coating starting to form on top. The quantity was definitely enough as I was full when I finished it, the lunch portion definitely would not have done the job, so if your hungry get the dinner size for $15.99.   Overall I expected a lot more as far as quality of food, the prices are up there and the ambience definitely gives it that fine dining vibe. If I come by again it won't be by my choice unless its for the bar area. On a positive note the service was great, my water never got low and she actually brought lemons with the water without me asking, she was super friendly and genuinely made us feel welcomed.",

    "text": "We had an experience similar to \"Rich M\" below, I'm guessing we had the same waitress/bartender. We came in on a Tuesday night, the bar was sort of busy but had no trouble finding an empty table. It took about 5 minutes to get a menu and then another 10 before we placed our drink order. The drinks came handily and we ordered food: an appetizer and a pub burger.  After about 25 minutes waiting, we asked the bartender if she could check on our appetizer, as we had wanted to pick on it with our beer while we waited for our food. She said she would check. When she left the bar, she made a circle around the entire bar, picking up dirty dishes as she went. Another patron asked her for \"another beer\" which she promptly poured and delivered to him... all while we were still waiting for her to \"check\" on our appetizer, which she then did.  When she came back she said that she told them in the kitchen to send out the app first. \"FIRST?\" I asked, having expected them about 10 minutes ago. \"I don't control the food,\" she said, and walked away. Several minutes later she went back to the kitchen and came out with both the app and the main dish. \"They both came out together,\" was her response, and when I expressed my dissatisfaction she said I could speak to her manager, whom she sent over.  I explained what happened, and she offered to comp the app and bring our check right away, as we had a movie to catch. She brought the check, I put the money in it, and it sat on our table for the next 15 minutes, as our \"waitress\" ignored us the rest of the night. I finally asked the hostess to send over the manager so we could pay our bill, and eventually a DIFFERENT MANAGER came out, and he had NO IDEA what had been going on, so I had to explain it all again. When we looked at the check, we realized that the waitress had overcharged us, not giving us the \"happy hour\" prices! At this point the 2nd manager offered to comp our entire meal, and our next appetizer when we come back, which I told him was doubtful, at least for a while, and he promised to \"talk to\" the waitress.  Not once during this entire night did our waitress apologize, act remorseful, or anything other than bothered that we were there in the first place. From the moment we sat down we felt as if we were inconveniencing her and keeping her from the couple next to us, whom she chatted with very friendly, while keeping things with us very cold and nasty. Elephant bar, do yourselves a favor and get rid of this girl - you know who she is. She is costing you patrons.",

Also, the manager Alisha even came out to see if our meals didn't have any food that we were allergic to! Very family-friendly and casual.",

This happened again after they brought our waters.    We ordered the drinks and one of the beers ordered came out wrong (IPA vs Red).  No excuses other than sorry/no credit given.  Appetizers were ok but the entrees weren't really warm (broccoli was way overcooked).  Ordered a 2nd wine and it took until the end of my meal to get there.  Total bill was $180 w/tip.  Have been disappointed here before as well.  Will think again before going next time.",

It's nothing I would crave although the Cajun chicken dish I got this last time was pretty tasty and spicy. Lance was our server on Halloween night and was super accommodating. I hate to be a pain but also don't think it hurts to ask about switching things up. He was able to accommodate all our needs and did it without acting inconvenienced at all which is always nice. Although the food was good, I'd go back just due to how nice the server was...especially on Halloween when it's busy and full of kids people usually seem a little \"short\" and he didn't at the slightest. I also thought it was awesome they handed out free kids meals that night during trick or treating and we were able to use our coupons immediately. Good end to a nice night with the kiddos.",

Esai was so patient and so kind and my son loved him. Even the manager Sean was so friendly and sweet . Moving cross country wasn't easy but it's little things like this that make easier .

    "text": "TL;DR the food is good, but good luck getting it in a reasonable time or right the first time  Met my wife and a friend here for happy hour.  They started out by mixing up my wife's and friends wine.  We asked for water when we ordered drinks. Maybe 5 minutes later we see our server bring water to a table that just sat down.  Then about 5 minutes later when our server walks by our table we ask again for water. She said 'oh yeah I brought the other table your water\".  After some time she comes back with 2 waters. I have to remind her we wanted one for each of us.  They gave me the wrong beer, not a big deal, but had to go to the  bar our server was gone. And even then it took quite awhile and a nearly empty bar to get help.  My food order was wrong the first two times they brought it out. Finally just took it because I didn't think they would be any more likely to get it correct.  They also didn't bring silverware/napkin out so I had to flag them done again and wait awhile.  We had to flag them down later to get the check. The check had an item we hadn't ordered on it.  And when I asked the server about it she said 'I told my manager about that he said he'd fix it'.  They did happily fix it and told me next time the service would be on point.  There are so many great options at the district and green valley ranch than here",

While my salmon was barely seasoned at all, it was hot and cooked perfectly; so I'm very confused on how the cooks got rice wrong, of all things. Same comments go for my friends food.",

Maybe that is the trick to eating low fat, the food is so hard, you cant eat it and you naturally lose weight!

    "text": "Yikes! What happened to Elephant Bar? It used to a be a really good restaurant with a great menu. There's used to be a lot of variety and selection. The menu has now been downsized and there are no more pictures. We came in on a late Saturday afternoon and there were a few people sitting at the bar and only ONE table in the dining room. That didn't seem like a good sign but we ordered anyways. My boyfriend got the Korean Beef tacos and the mango salsa on the plate tasted rancid. I got the chicken marsala and it had a weird taste to it. It definitely didn't taste like a wine sauce. More like a gravy with a weird spice that was overpowering everything. When we left I immediately felt like throwing up and had really bad acid reflux, which NEVER happens to me. Needless to say, we probably won't be returning. Now I see why a lot of them closed down in California. Very disappointing.",

The booths are generally clean and the restaurant isn't too busy. Food comes out quickly and they're quick to accommodate anyone with allergies. It's also in a very convenient location which makes it a go to dinner spot. My only issue was with the server that I had the other night as he did not split the bill with my friend and me and charged me the full amount of the dinner. If my friend didn't have cash, I would have ended up paying for the whole meal. He also left and never returned after he did this so there was no way that I could get him to fix it.",

I thought maybe it's just me but someone else in our party had the same salad which looked completely different and he thought the same thing.  It's in a great location but I anticipate this restaurant closing soon as on a Saturday night it was almost totally empty.  No one in our 11 person group really enjoyed their meal.

The service today w/ Maria, JJ & as we were walking out, Jamie, all smiling faces & very helpful made me raise my three star to a solid five star.  Drastic move in only a few days, but we were impressed.  I am not always sure if people in the restaurants are reading my reviews & I feel they took it to heart w/ a good attitude & that makes the difference.  Making reasonable changes to make customers happy seems easy & successful & I am thankful to walk back in & can't wait until next time.

I don't know how frequently they do that but their regular happy hour goes until 7 which is great if you are trying to make it after work.   The happy hour food was delicious. We tried lettuce wraps, pot stickers, artichoke dip, and calamari. My favorite was the lettuce wrap. The drinks were very good too. All of us ordered a cocktail which is 2 dollars off during happy hour.   We loved their outdoor seating , it's perfect for soaking in the crisp fall weather. My only complaint is their bathrooms are very outdated compared to the rest of the restaurant.",

The \"local yocals\" need to get out more. \"Happy Hour\" has ALWAYS been, at every establishments, at their BAR. There maybe some that serve their entire venue the HH menu, but it is always an inducement to \"buddy up\" at the bar and \"Get Happy\" The \"Happy Hour\" started long ago during Shakespeares time and was defined during the prohibition as Speakeasies that served alcohol at the bar before eating at Restaurants that don't serve alcohol. Happy Hour at the Bar has been an unwritten tradition. If it's not written in a Restraurant advert, obviously the marketing people were sophisticated enough not to give it a second thought that patrons knew it meant at their bar. I traveled in Rock bands in my youth and Musicians flocked to the establishments bars that offered Happy Hour. I've made friends with my alcoholic, and nonalcoholic, peers that have lasted a lifetime at those bars. Next time you see \"Happy Hour\" check out who's at the bar and grab some free appetizers and cheap drinks. Elephant Bar is the BOMB!",

Obviously we were seated as soon as we walked in and almost all the tables were empty. Our server was nice and provided pretty good service with a few exceptions. We started with the calamari and ordered the California cobb salad and the misoyaki salmon. I usually stay away from farm raised fish as there is a big difference in taste but I was assured it was good.   The calamari was brought out and it was terrible. Very greasy and fishy tasting with a thick coat of batter. The Cobb wasn't bad, but just your typical salad. The salmon was presented nicely and I liked the thin vegetables it was served with. The fish itself I didn't like, it just didn't taste fresh like salmon should. The misoyaki sauce was pretty good but didn't help the flavor enough.   For dessert we ordered the butter cake and cheesecake. By now a few more people came in that were seated around us. We saw our desserts sitting on the counter in the kitchen for quite a while. We didn't see our server, or anyone for that matter. It was all I could do to not walk over and just get them myself. Finally the hostess walked over and brought them to us. The first couple bites of butter cake were good, but then it got cold and hard, like they didn't heat it all the way through. The cheesecake was better.   I visit the district often, but don't see myself returning here.",

But tonight, we went for date night.  Great diversity in their menu to appeal to any audience.  Calamari app was delish. Order extra sauce. Or salmon skin roll is another fav.  Then went with teriyaki chicken. I'm a spicy  girl so I added siracha. The plate was larger than expected so I now have lunch for tomorrow my boyfriend had the salmon. He really liked it. Cooked well, seasoned just right!  He almost licked the plate lol  Anyway, great service and food and the atmosphere is awesome in the district. This is a great dinner spot before drinks in the area.",

Our food came and as the server was putting down my boyfriends food I noticed there was blue cheese. I know he would never order blue cheese on a burger, so I ask the waiter and he said it's the PEAR BURGER and he wanted a PUB BURGER. Seeing as the dining room was crazy loud and it just seemed like he didn't hear us correctly, I just laughed and said its totally okay and he corrected the problem, came back, and offered us a free dessert to go for the trouble.

The only reason I am docking a star is because of the bar. Maybe it's just bad luck, but  each time we have gone, the bar is either out of something or has made the drink from a different recipe. The last time they used a Sprite/ 7up instead of a ginger ale...and another drink had a different whiskey than what we asked for..and the mojito, which is usually very good, tasted like it was seltzer water and not sweet at all. The waitress explained that there were substitutions used and let us change our drinks. I hate to mention it, but ordering the mixed drinks seems to be an issue each time we dine here. We will continue to come here for the food, but I wish they could improve their bar. I think it would also improve their happy hour business if they were known for more than just a glass of wine or sangria.",

It lacked flavor and tasted like spinach that was cooked in a creme sauce, not a good consistency. The lettuce wraps come with two sauces that are mouth watering out of this world! One is a peanut sauce, the other a sweet cilantro sauce. My son who is 8 loved the kids chicken tender strips. The breading on them is very crunchy and delicious he said. My husband ordered the tortilla soup, not too spicy for him, and the chicken marinara dish. He said it was O.K. which means it was nothing to rave about.

Walking in, we were led to our table by a stern face hostess who acted as though I was bothering her when I asked what the happy hours were for today. Minus one star.  My sister and I shared a Macau shrimp and noodle soup. In addition, I ordered a red sangria and coconut shrimp skewers while she ordered a Mai Tai and BBQ Ribs.   Do people in Macau eat their soup laden in sugar or what, because this soup was unusually sweet unlike any other Asian soup I've ever tried in my life. Oh, and I'm Asian, by the way, so I've tried bowls of Asian noodle soup amidst many. My friend who is Swiss thoroughly enjoyed this noodle soup, as she excitedly exclaimed to us that this is her favorite soup at this place. Perhaps my sister and I differ in taste in comparison to the general populace when it comes to noodle soup. Regardless, this isn't the typical Asian soup that we expected it to be. Minus another star.  Her BBQ ribs came with a small cup of deliciously warm slices of cooked apple, a pile of coleslaw and regular plus sweet potato fries. This entire entree is very good. My coconut shrimp skewers were also excellent.  The star of the night for me is the red sangria. All of the ingredients in this drink were so perfect in ratio, between the fruit, the ice and the amount of liquor. I'd come back here for happy hours!",

    "text": "Elephant Bar fell off my radar after multiple visits where we received progressively bad service... The last visit being one where we walked out without eating due to total incompetence by the wait staff. So when my husband suggested we have dinner at Elephant Bar after doing some shopping, I was a little hesitant, but since I did enjoy the food on prior visits where we got to eat, I agreed to go.   The host was very friendly, he offered us the option of sitting at a table, booth or in the bar area so that we could watch the game. Our waitress came by shortly afterward to take our drink order.  For our entrees, both my husband and I decided to order off the special menu. I went with the Pacific Cove Tropical Crab and Shrimp Louie ($14.25). I was in the mood for both seafood and a salad, so this was perfect. The grilled pineapple and mango were nice compliments to the sweet clumps of crab and pieces of shrimp. My only disappointment was that dressing was served on the side, and drizzled on the salad, I would have preferred it all on the side.   My husband went with the Mongolian Beef, a dish he enjoys at many places. He was offered a choice of white, brown or fried rice... Always nice when you are given options like this. When his food arrived, I immediately thought \"That's it?\" What a small serving. My husband enjoyed the food but it was not enough to fill him up and at $14.50, it was overpriced for the portion received.   The service we received was better then previous visits, obviously, we stayed this time...  Our waitress was still rather mundane. She always seemed like she was in a hurry despite the restaurant being fairly slow, and I don't think I saw her smile once.   Elephant Bar is back on my radar, but I am not in a big hurry to return.",

I mean I cannot be comparing this restaurant to...let's say...Buchon at the Venetian....cause that's just ridiculous!  Being an American non-fine-dining restaurant, this is a great place to go with friends!    If it wasn't for the gift certificate I got, I may not even have stopped in here to dine at all!  It must have been fate! ;-) They have an awesome happy hour special!  Great food and drinks!  And on top of that our waitress was awesome!  Loved her!  Made some great recommendations and my friends and I all had a great time!    I pretty much tried all of the appetizers on the happy hour menu and I cannot remember any of them being disappointing...in fact I wanted more!  We even ordered the Jambalya, which was decent!  It could have been more spicier to give it that southern kick, but the flavor was there!    If you are in the Green Valley area and is looking for a place to have a good time during happy hour, check this place out!  Good food, good drinks, sounds like HAPPY hour to me! =)",

I can't begin to explain how my first visit to this location changed the way I feel about customer service nowadays. From the moment we were sat, both Tina, our server, and Mike--the BEST manager in the industry--displayed a sincerest genuine interest in taking amazing care of us. He made sure our meals were prepared to our liking, brought me a courtesy cell phone charger, (yes... He's the General Manager), brought us a sample of an appetizer to our table due to the simple fact of asking him what a table across from us had ordered because it looked so delicious (beer battered onion rings btw :-), actually engaged in conversation with not just us but all of the guests; meanwhile Tina's attention to us was also incredibly above-and-beyond as well. Our waters never went less than half-full, and just her overall friendly presence was enough for me to understand what kind of leadership they have here. Mike, thank you, and we DEFINITELY plan on coming back very soon. There happy hour here looks incredibly enticing as well. These people seriously made our day and went above and beyond more than I can explain and about only making this up because I'm so used to terrible customer service at other restaurants and this place blew my mind. The other elephant bar locations in Orlando and Sacramento I have had great experiences but not nearly as great as the specific location I highly recommend it to everybody. Tell Mike and Tina that Mike C. sent you! By the way just ordering the old-style nachos and the midday lunch crusted chicken breast was more than that for me I could hardly finish it. Simply the best service and experience!",

They seem to be serving more Asian food choices than anything.  I guess there are elephants in Asia but the decor suggest a more African vibe.  I wouldn't call it eclectic because it really doesn't have any commonly neutral foods on the menu like sandwiches, pastas or soups.

I ordered the top sirloin and it was smothered in butter and over cooked. I ordered it medium well and it was closer to well then medium. I guess that's what you get for $16. The Veggies looked soggy (didn't even try). The only appealing looking food was the mashed potatoes, until I tried them. You have to try hard to mess up mash potatoes. The only thing I liked out of the meal was the lagunitas ipa, even though I ordered a rebel ipa. You cant fool an Irish when it comes to beer. When I asked the waiter he said \"oh yeah, we're tapped out of rebel\", then walked away. It would have been nice to maybe offer the second beer at a discount because he didn't give me what I ordered, but whatever. Standards must be pretty low if you find this \"Asian restaurant streak house bar\", or whatever it is, appealing. Since we're in Vegas I'll place a wager that this place will be out of business when the BWW opens.",

He seems to really love what he does and interacts wonderfully with guests. He went above and beyond everything we expected. There's no way I'm waiting a couple years to go back again!",

Unfortunately the food I ordered didn't mention it had mushrooms which I'm allergic too, it sucked cause it looked absolutely amazing the teriyaki chicken. I notified my server Lucy and she took care of it right away super apologetic. The manager over heard and immediately jumped in offering suggestions for different meals. They were awesome even though it wasn't there fault but was at the same time they made it right. I ended up getting the cowboy stake and wow it was fantastic just melted in your mouth definitely a must try. Also my gf got the pub burger and that thing was huge she only was able to eat three bites and she was forcing it down cause how great it tasted. Highly recommend visiting great place great people. Great pizookie.",

When I registered on the app, my family was able to order the thai-chili edamame appetizer on the house. The  customer service was on-point, the server was polite and patient. We felt like we could time our time and enjoy the experience without feeling rushed eventhough it was a busy night. My wife and I ordered the same thing thesirloin topped with a flavorful steak butter also served with ratatouille vegetables and brown rice (from the lighter side). The sirloin was cooked perfectly...it is difficult to get a perfect medium-rare steak these days. We will be back to earn more rewards!!",

    "text": "The Elephant Bar is a place that I visit when other people make the choice to eat here.  It's in Henderson and popular with the work friends because we just head over after the work whistle blows.  I came here for dinner recently and as is usual for me, I searched their menu online beforehand to see if there was nutrition info available and there was.  I decided that I would either go with their chicken lettuce wraps or the petite sirloin, based on calories and protein content.  They happen to have a gluten-free menu as well as a \"lighter\" menu, which I appreciate.  Once there, my friends and I had great service from our waiter the whole time.  I went with the petite sirloin, which came with vegetables and a parmesan baked potato for only 450 calories and 36 g of protein--right up my alley.  It was a tasty meal and I was more than impressed with it since I didn't know if it was going to be good or not.  This is only the second time I've been here in maybe a year.  Between them, my friends had the mongolian beef and the shrimp and crab louie salad, with the mongolian beef looking like something I'd try the next time.  The pals also had a coupon for free strawberry shortcake with the purchase of two entrees and I had a sample taste of that:  delicious!  The bill came to $43, without the dessert being charged--not bad at all for three people.  Overall, this place has a lot of options on its menu, enough to satisfy everyone's palates and dietary needs.  I hear the happy hour is great, so I'll have to return and check that out sometime.",

This last time it tasted like the Korean BBQ sauce they put on it had burned. Not on the grill, but in the pan they either keep it warm in or when they hear it up for the food.   We also like the crab Louie side salad, the fries green beans and the coconut shrimp.   The salmon is hit and miss as well. Sometimes you get a nice thick filet, other times you get the thin tail end. BTW, I prefer the filet.   The eCookie is great. Most of all, DON'T BE AFRAID TO SEND IT BACK!",

    "text": "My wife's friend wanted to celebrate her birthday at Elephant Bar Restaurant.  This was our first time here.  Location and atmosphere.. The web page does not mention the Anthem address.  It was difficult to find.  By the way, it is NOT in the Green Valley Casino.  It is actually 2 blocks down in a mall call the DISTRICT.  Next to the District is a cinema.  Parking is about 150 yards or so away.  I wish it was better lit.  The restaurant is pretty nice (a bit noisy).  It has some type of African theme.  I give this a 3.5 stars.  Service -- our waittress was pretty nice and busy.  We had 3-4 people waiting on us (water, food, etc...).  Food -- well, the menu is kinda all over the place... surf and turf and asian fusion.  This kinda sprung a red light.  Sometimes, when a restaurant has too much variety, it can lower the quality of food.  We ordered the Grand Sampler.  It was pretty good.  The coconut shrimp was tasty hot, chicken fingers were okay, and the spinach dip was actually pretty good.  I ordered the Kono combo - ribs, chicken, and skewered shrimp.  The ribs were tender and very good, shrimp was a bit over cooked (being a seafood lover, first time that I could not eat or finish all the shrimp), and the chicken was awful -- it was dried and rubbery.  I bet the chicken was NUKED in the microwave.  I only took two bites too many from the chicken.  My wife had the Ahi Shashimi.  The shashimi was decent; however, the rice layers and veggies was not very good.  She did not touch that.   As for drinks, I had the Jungle Colada.  I think this was the best part of the meal.  Overall, I give the food a very LOW 3 or a high 2.    Overall, for 5 of us, 1 large appetizers, drinks, and 5 entrees, the bill ran to about $165 (excluding tips).  Because of the service and atmosphere, this gets a 3.  It could have been lower.  Note:  if you like this type of food (surf and turf), I think a better alternative would be a Red Lobster.",

I ordered the Pan Braised Rock Sugar Beef With Pappardelle Noodles - the beef was very though and dry, the sauce was just good but nothing exciting.  The manager kindly offered to give me something else, so I ordered the Fire-Grilled Lemon Garlic Chicken Breast but the chicken was chewy and though, the sauce was good, the mashed potatoes were salty, the vegetables were bland.

We were seated next to a large party of high schoolers heading to their homecoming or something. They were loud and boisterous but thank god they left about 10 mins after we were seated.  Our waiter Tom, was very nice and enthusiastic. I was quite surprised after reading on Yelp that this location's service sucked.   I got the jambalaya and it was pretty good. The shrimp was cooked perfectly.. but definitely not spicy enough. The brown rice was kind of on the dry side. The boyfriend got the misoyaki salmon and to be honest.. it looked a hell of a lot better on the menu! The bf's mom got the french onion soup and sweet potato fries. The fries were really good!  I got a drink called Road to Lahaina. It was pretty damn good. It had mango puree and some pineapple juice with captain morgan.

    "text": "Been here multiple times. Mostly lunch hour or afternoon. Tonight decided to make a dinner run at 6:00 pm. The wait for a table was nearly 30 minutes, not bad for Friday dinner hour. When we were finally seated the place was half empty. What the hell??? All these empty tables and a 30 minute wait???Makes no sense to me. Server said it was normal to be this way on Friday. (2) of us. We each ordered a bowl of French Onion Soup. Then we ordered 3 appetisers to split. The soup was not bad. Have had better but it was OK. The appetisers were not good. No Flavors. We split the lettuce wraps. The lettuce used was not right. It was all stuck together and tore up when we tried to seperate it. The sauces were very bland.  Waitress said the peanut sauce was spicey. However we found it had no flavor no heat. The parmesean grean beans were bland. No flavor. Worthless food. The wait staff was horrible. Not responsive. Finally a manager came by and we asked for drink refils and extra sauce. He was more service than our waitress. The only treat we got was when we got the bill. The appetisers were half price so the bill was much less than I had expected. Shape up Elephant Bar. You have a great location and you can ruin it very easy.",

We only came for the reverse happy hour but she told us to order the Adventure Platter to save a few dollars instead of ordering each app separately! We had the Buffalo Dip, Shrimp Skewers, and Lettuce Wraps and all 3 items arrived to the table quick and were so delicious! She even suggested the Mud Pie for dessert (my fav!) Despite taking care of a 6 top table on the patio, she was very attentive and expeditious. Definitely requesting her next time we come in. Thank you Alisha for making our dining experience pleasant & noteworthy!",

Found out there's one local here in Henderson so we decided to give it a second try. Total day and night difference!   The food was delicious. Had a clam chowder the was hearty and fresh full of flavor. Also orders the Mongolian beef! The veggies were cooked perfectly and the meet had just enough spice and sauce mixed with peppers and white rice. My husband ordered the big pub burger with a fried egg onion ring and bacon. I know sounds like a lot and yes it was enormous but he let me have a bite and yup yummy. He finished the whole thing and all the sweet potato fries. He said it's one of his top burger spots in town! We brought our little 10 month baby and we got a her a little side garlic mashed potatoes and she loved it!!!  They just renovated so all there chairs, booths  and table have fresh fabric. Nice carpet and wall covering. When A Company takes care of it appearance they put effort in staffing and quality of food.      The staff was very welcoming and personable. Jaime our server was very sweet and helped point out the best things on the menu. The managers Kirk and JJ were very nice professional communicating to staff and introducing themselves to guests.  There team is like a well oiled machine and they understand restaurant hospitality!",

I ordered the beer cause it was a little bit of a deal for Happy Hour and ended up getting billed separately..    I didn't even really need a beer I am just a sucker for a deal.  6 bucks for one small beer is not a very good happy hour price.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elephantbar.com%2Fstayhappy2%2F&s=a7b7e62bb946427a60fa6eff020d1d45e1485e5f779ed675cce8d4fec10b8131\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">elephantbar.com/stayhapp...</a>",

I usually have better luck parking in the back for easy access to the restaurant.  I've had good visits the majority of the time I have dined here.  They have great happy hour specials in the bar area.  The food has been great and pretty consistent.  The french onion sliders are fabulous.  Simple and Wonderful! The nachos are plentiful and great to share.  The buffalo chicken wontons are just ok to me.  I'd stick to the sliders and nachos for happy hour.  Their market cobb salad entree is delicious.  The chicken has a great seasoning which makes this salad yummy.    The service here for us has been hit and miss.   Sometimes my drink is empty for a while.   I've noticed on a few occasions during happy hour the bartenders are more interested in talking to each other than their customers.  Hmmm.  But mostly they have been good and attentive.  It's a chain restaurant but it's one of those that I enjoy!",

I guess he told everyone what happened because they knew who I was. And I'm ok with that. That's how people learn. We are all human we make mistakes. Saying I'm sorry sometimes is all we need to hear. Thank you   Updating my stars Joe our server was extremely nice had my food I was taking to go ready when I was done eating my food was amazing came by to check on us.

    "text": "So the other night, my family and I went to the Elephant Bar after it had been several years since our last visit.  My grandma was in town for a visit and was dying to go when she found out that we still have a location open here in the Vegas Valley.  All the restaurants in SoCal are no more and so she cannot dine as she used to.  On Tuesday evevning we headed down to the District which seems to be thriving as a whole.  The Elephant Bar seemed to be doing pretty well too.  There was a good crowd for an early week night.  Despite the busy restaurant, we were seated right away and greeted promptly by our server.  He brought up some water while we looked over the menu and decided first on some drinks.  Grandma got a sangria roja.  My dad got a tall Bud Light.  I had a mai tai.  I don't know how much alcohol was in these drinks.  Probably not much but they tasted good regardless.  For the food, I think it took my grandma and me the longest to decide.  My grandma wanted a dish with shrimp only but could only find shrimp and chicken dishes.  The waiter offered double shrimp in place of the chicken and that made up her mind.  She got what seemed to be pasta with marinara and shrimp.  I was the final hold out and ordered the wood-fired tri tip and hoisin BBQ grilled chicken.  It was flavorful but perhaps too saucey for my liking.  But I had no issue in eating it and did not complain about a thing.  The beef was tender and the chicken strongly herbed.  The mashed potatoes were dense but softened well when mixed with the BBQ sauce from the chicken.  The fresh sprig of rosemary in the potatoes was a nice arromatic touch.  Though I liked my meal just fine, I was disappointed in one aspect of the evening.  The fact that the Elephant Bar does not carry the dish I used to get from there any more.  It was a big bowl of noodle soup with their Pan Asian chicken skewers.  That was a favorite of mine from almost any restaurant.  I saw the Pan Asian chicken on the appetizer section of the menu but they were served over vegetables rather than soup.  That just was not going to cut it.  It was the combination that I enjoyed.  Too bad they did away with it.  My dad was much more pleased with his Mongolian beef and would like to start going to Elephant Bar again now that it is fresh in his memory as a place he rather likes.  I guess I know what I am getting him for Christmas.",

    "text": "I am not really sure what to say about Elephant Bar. When I think about it my mind just goes blank. Vanilla, bland, neutral, uneventful... just there.  Given that, it is a decent place to just stop over for a quick bite while shopping or before a movie and I find myself there every so often just because it is convenient and close. They do have pretty good happy hour specials (food and drink), but as is my problem with many places in Vegas their food is the definition of corporate. It could be the exact same recipes from Claim Jumper, Cheesecake Factory, Applebee's or any other 'New American'-style chain. I wont hate them for it, but dont expect any amazing culinary surprises.  As for the drinks, I have to say they are decent. The male bartender who always happens to be there when I go (admission: I always sit in the bar... its closer to the alcohol) is always friendly enough and makes a good drink. The atmosphere is low-key enough that you can sit and have a pretty in-depth conversation without anyone bothering you which rates high in my book. Overall a good place for drinks, decent place for food, but not a destination.",

The Waiters that dealt with me were much more friendly.  What knocked my rating down to 3 stars was the speed of service. I waited about 20 minutes to get my drink and then another hour to get my food. I understand that sometimes a place is rocking and that the cooks make food based on when it was ordered, but the place only had like 10 people in it, and all of them had their food already when I had arrived.   The saving grace of this place was that the food pleased my taste buds nicely. I had some of the Parmesan crusted green beans and wow, were they good.They come with a nice little dipping sauce of some kind that really tops them off nicely.  Next I had the Shrimp and Chicken Jambalaya. The huge thing that got me here was that it was chicken Jambalaya, which I LOVED. I've been searching for a place that doesn't have pork or beef in their Jambalaya and have came up empty on most counts. Definitely something to check out if you don't eat red meat.  Prices were fair, nothing to write home about though.  Food was great, service was mediocre at best, and prices were decent. Maybe a place to check out, but I wouldn't come here often.",

There were three of us and we all enjoyed our meal.  I had the pot roast over mashpotatoes.  Melt in your mouth good. Our dessert of creme brulee was to die for.

Coming back to Vegas to visit, I was really excited to eat here and have that salad again!  Unfortunately, it looks like they changed their entire menu and they no longer make that salad.  :(  This is probably why my rating is not higher than a 3.

The interior is a safari motif with huge palm fans and larger than life animal structures. There is a bar off to the left, always full of business types, and if you can find a table, I suggest grabbing it. Sometimes the wait for the main dining area can be close to an hour on a busy weekend evening. The bartenders are usually pretty attentive as well. The shrimp trio platter is a great appetizer, and I always enjoy the fajitas for my main entre. The mixed drinks are seriously amazing. I have never gone wrong with any of them. Don't order wine or beer here. Order their signature drinks. The cute one with the ring of raspberry around the glass is my fave (sorry, I can't remember the name right now, but they will know what your talking about if you decide to order it.) My only complaint is that sometimes the hostesses are a bit...ahem...snooty. But I guess I would be too if my job was to jam pack a million hungry, thirsty patrons in the restaurant every weekend!",

When we got sat outside we had to go inside to find someone to come out and take care of us after patiently waiting fifteen minutes for someone to approach the table.   Our server was absolutely horrible.   Everything took forever and she told us some horrible story about how much she didn't like working there, and how bad things were going in her life.  When we complained to the manager about the food taking forever, she said she would take care of it, but then nothing happened.  When we finally did get our food, it was borderline gross.  I'm sure it might have tasted a little better if we weren't all completely disgusted with the overall experience to that point.    I tried to find the manager at the end again to give her a summary of how crappy our evening was, but she was no where to be found.  I'm usually able to tell if a place is just having a \"bad night\" but considering that the place was hardly a third full, and nothing went right from start to finish, I have no problem telling everybody and their uncle to stay away.",

On one visit the young waitress took my plate away when there was food still on it....I wanted to take my leftovers home!! I was pissed!! My most recent visit my waitress rushed away after we each ordered an entree. I wanted to order an extra order of chicken fingers for my son as his appetite has grown to adult size. My friend had to call the waitress back (Katrina) where she abruptly asked \"you don't think he'll have enough chicken in his kids meal?\" Umm....No...that's why I'm ordering more!!!

My sweet and sour chicken was dry and had more breading than chicken and was burnt. My husbands Mongolian beef was all salt and fat. The manager didn't even recognize it as he asked how he liked his \"cashew chicken\" to which my husband told him it was Mongolian beef. The manager seemed embarrassed that he didn't know his own food. The rice was crispy and hard. When the manager realized we were not pleased with our meal he offered to buy us dessert which we declined since dinner was so bad, we didn't want to take the chance and just wanted to get out. Our waitress, who we saw once to take our order, another time to bring me the wrong drink and the 3rd time to hand us our check (over $60) gave us coupons for our next visit which will never happen. I've never written a review before, good or bad but this was so disgusting I had to share.",

Then ordered an appetizer after stopping our waitress after 15 minutes of waiting for her. We got the artichoke dip. It was very running. We had our appetizer not even a minute and they were placing our dinner in front of us... We didn't even try our appetizer and when I questioned not even our waitress she was like well do you want me to take it back...  I ordered the teriyaki chicken... It was very salty. My fiancee had the rack of ribs and rice. It also was very salty and didn't really eat any of it also the rice was very dry. More then the food being disappointing the service so bad. Our waitress came over twice during the whole time and both times we stopped her... She never smiled or asked us how everything was. When she brought us our bill she just put it on our table without saying a word. So you would think it's just the waitress but no there was a manager he walked by us 8 times and never said a word to us or looked our way and he would walk up to were the food was out to be really to serve and he would stand there rubbing his beard and then would pick up the plates to take them and serve them. Just very disappointing after all the wonderful things we have heard about this place.",

    "text": "Elephant Bar is one of those restaurants where I would only go to during happy hour. There are a few stipulations, so pay attention. Happy hour deals only apply if you sit at the bar. They have two set times, Monday through Friday from 3pm to 7pm and another one everyday from 9pm to close.   The bartender does not make chit-chat, but she got the job done. With running a bar and the dining area surrounding it, I cannot hold it against her.  The drinks range from two dollars for non-alcoholic cocktails to six dollar specialty drinks. If you like well drinks then they will run you three dollars.   The food runs from three to six dollars. The most expensive appetizers are the coconut shrimp and the seared ahi tuna. Both dishes are worth the price. If they cost more, I might not have thought so. The ahi tuna comes with a refreshing salad consisting of bitter greens, sprouts, cucumbers, carrots, and topped with seaweed salad. It is accompanied by ponzu sauce. Without that, or soy sauce, the dish would be on the dry side. I love raw ahi, so the texture of the seared outside could be the reason for my complaint. We also got an order of the sweet potato fries. They are nothing out of the ordinary. Crisp, not greasy, but lacked a contrast. It needed a light dusting of sea salt and a tangy sauce to give a more bold flavor. Bachi Burger offers the best version of this tuber for that exact reason.",

First of all, I will admit that what initially caught my eye about the place was the name. I love elephants...this is The Elephant Bar...what can be bad??  My husband and I were were meeting a group, and we arrived early so we sat in the bar and ordered drinks while we waited. There were 2 bartenders working and both of them (at different times) greeted us and made menu suggestions. I was impressed because the bar area was pretty full.  When it came time for dinner, Lisa was our server, and she was awesome. Sometimes when you dine in a group the service suffers, but not here, she was even on top of refills. Again, I was impressed.  The restaurant itself was nice enough. Other yelpers have pretty much nailed the decor.  I ordered the Mongolian Beef w/o mushrooms and hot peppers. It was fabulous AND they didn't mess up my special request!! I gave it an A. My husband ordered the Ribeye Sandwich & the Mac N' Cheese. The Mac N' Cheese was visibly dry, but overall he gave it a B+.  Others in our group ordered the pear salad, which looked beautiful, the Orange Chicken which I was told \"was good, but not very orange-y\".  My only regret is that I did not leave room for dessert!! Some of them looked pretty amazing!!  Overall, I was not disappointed with The Elephant Bar. I was most impressed with the great service, but the food was very good too. I am rarely in the Green Valley area, but I would definitely dine here again.",

My dad wanted garlic bread & assumed it came with his dinner but it didn't so our waiter never missing a beat brought him some. They pretty much ran the waiter for the entire meal. It was very busy that night being Valentine's Day and our waiter Jordan did an outstanding job. Unfortunately my dad is very cheap & nitpicky so after dinner was over & we said our goodbyes, I hid around the corner until they were gone & went back into the restaurant to give Jordan a bigger tip.

I had a craving for their Cadillac Margarita, if it's as yummy as The Elephant Bar & Grill in San Diego and yes, same company.  Another favorite is the Quick Seared Ahi Tuna Salad slightly different in a sense that it had seaweed in the salad - heaven to the lips and perfect for satiety.  It's a plus for me when I can maintain eating healthy while dining out... We sat at the surrounding bar area - high table/arm-stool seating. They are located outside theater section outside Green Valley Casino.  Fun staff!  Very attentive and seemed interested in making sure our food was exactly the way we liked it.  I had a little taste of his Spicy Singapore noodles w Shrimp - the noodles were slightly crisp but full of flavor. I'm still not sure if it was my ravishing beauty that got all the attention or maybe he's just a nice guy??? No drama I promise.  Had fun till it was closing time (midnight).  Lots of parking.  There's TV.  Great ambience for hangin' out in the evenings. Full Bar.

    "text": "First off, anyone who knows me would be SHOCKED that I would go to a chain let alone this place but I got a gift card for Christmas so I thought I would go use it up last night. So I go in and it all started off ok. Bartender seemed nice enough. Bourbon selection was what you could expect from a place like this so I got myself a Maker's on the rocks and perused the menu. Since I wasn't paying I figured I'd order a nice big meal and relax for a bit. When the bartender came over I started ordering but I only got out the appetizer (Edamame) and Salad (Pear Gorgonzola) when she started walking off. I had to get her attention and stop her so I could finish ordering. It was rather odd if you ask me but again, you can't get your hopes up too much in a place like this.  A little while later, and I really thought it took a bit longer than it should, someone comes out with the Edamame AND salad at the same time. It took a second for the person to finally get it when I kept telling them that I didn't want them at the same time. She seemed awfully confused by the fact that I would want to sit and enjoy my edamame and THEN eat my salad. I sent the salad back with a bad feeling it would just sit in the window, which is what it did because it took the bartender seconds to go back to get it and bring it out. Quite obvious that they just set it back in the kitchen.  When I finally ate my salad it was nothing special. I don't know why but it was insanely boring even though it sounded like it should be good. I'm not even that picky of an eater, but only finished it so that I wouldn't get my entree spit in and I was hungry so I didn't feel like waiting forever.  I order a Ribeye for dinner as I was starving for protein and iron. I couldn't believe, once again, how flipping boring this steak was. Luckily I still had soy sauce close by so I poured some on to get a little flavor. Even the  mashed potatoes were lack luster. They tried to be \"fancy\" a put a ridiculous rosemary sprig in it, but it just didn't save the bland food.   After only two drinks they RAN OUT of Maker's Mark. I REALLY couldn't believe they had no back up. I just can't imagine the people who hang out at this bar are drinking up Makers so that tells me they don't stock well. I wound up drinking Jack since the only other \"high end\" bourbon they had was Woodford, which I don't really think is a decent whiskey to drink straight.   All in all it was an experience that just backs up my distaste for these chain restaurants. Boring food, mediocre service, and mind numbing atmosphere. I don't get why these places are successful but then again, I don't McDonald's or Taco Bell and they are successful too.   If you are in the District go to Balboa Pizza or King's Fish House. Save your money and your taste buds from this place.",

Our server, Jamie, gave exceptional customer service by introducing us to the deals and specials offered and recommending some of her own favorite dishes because I was so indecisive. We started with the artichoke dip and the coconut shrimp skewers for appetizers. The skewers were paired with an amazing sauce that each of us really enjoyed. I ended up getting the jambalaya which was very flavorful and the garlic bread was so yummy. For dessert, I ordered the cheesecake which was a pretty big slice of decadent goodness! The food did not disappoint but it was Jamie's attentiveness and comaderie that made my mother's birthday dinner a truly special experience. Also the huge elephant wall statue in the wait area is a great photo opportunity I couldn't resist!",

    "text": "So.. my favorite animals are elephants and I heard great things about this place.  When I first walked in the decor was great and I thought it would be quite the spot.    Boy was I wrong.    The tower of dirty drinks on the bar that needed to be placed in the dishwasher followed by the manager, Zoltan, flirting and talking pictures with the girls sitting at the bar while my drink sat empty was quite disappointing.  We did however take advantage of the elephant bar rewards program which got us a free appetizer immediately online when we registered.  We got the edamame, coconut shrimp skewers, and spinach artichoke dip.  It was all decent, at best.  We then had the pleasure of speaking with Zoltan, the manager, who when we asked if he was the manager he said \"No, I just hang out here\".  He was then asked by us why this tower of glasses was sitting next to us and he just made excuses for it.  We asked if he needed to hire a dishwasher to assist with the dishes & he said no and that the bartenders should be doing a better job.  He didn't act like he cared at all.  He was too busy taking selfies with the drunk blonde across the bar.    I then went to the bathroom where the toilet didn't flush & there was just enough toilet paper for me.   Roy the bartender was very attentive however the other bartender was about as bad of a sever as you can get.  I would order through him & then he would just tell Roy what I ordered & Roy would serve me.  After we had commented on the pile up of glasses the bartender made a comment to the one server who was dropping her glasses off and she said \"I don't really give a shit\" and then Quartae the bartender said \"Fuck off\".. in ears reach of myself and the rest of the bar to hear.  It was quite the experience and I don't think ill ever be back!",

We were told all the other tables were reserved no matter how long we waited. Never heard of that but ok. We squished into the table and waited for our waitress. She finally came and took our drink order. After a wait we finally ordered our food. 45 minutes after arriving we still had no food (and they weren't crowded which also didn't make the table debacle any sense). Our food finally came and half of us liked ours the other half not so much. We also had to wait for refills on our drinks. So in the end the service and food were just ok. After the change I doubt we'll be back.",

Happy Hour starts at 3pm, and on Wednesday's they have $5 glasses of wine. It's a great selection of wine and I really enjoy the sangria blanco.  However the food was underwhelming to say the least. As you can see in the photo, we opted for 2 of the $6 shareables.   First, the tempura salmon roll, which came with only four individual pieces of sushi, which had quite a bit of rice and not a lot of anything else. When it was dropped off they forgot the soy sauce, so we had to wait a few minutes til the server came back around.  Our second choice was the chicken lettuce wraps. Something I've ordered a few times from the happy hour menu, but this time we had just 3 pieces of lettuce. Which averages out to $2 per roll, not exactly a happy hour deal.  Our server and bartender, Jose, was very friendly, but clearly had too many customers to handle on his own. So we didn't get a lot of attention.  If you're going to Elephant Bar for Happy Hour stay away from the sad portions on the salmon tempura roll and the lettuce wraps.",

One cannot beat 5 wine, so I decided to try a white wine why it was on the fruity side; was very delicious. They offer great deals on appetizers that usually are $10-12 are only $6. What a deal? I ended up trying the bruschetta and toast which was so good. The way the spinach was prepared was so well done. I tried their potato wedges which are so cheesy that it is running over the potato's with bacon pieces all around.  I ended up taking food to go since the appetizers were so filling . For the main dinner plate I ordered the 10 oz steak which comes with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Had to experience dessert too which I ordered strawberry cheesecake, and it even came with an Oreo crust. It was so rich that I could not even eat all of it in one setting. The steak was cooked to perfection and was so moist and thick. The service kind of lacked while we were eating there and a manager walking by noticed that we were ready to go and checked us out, but our server was the only waitress for the bar and patio area. We did not hold it against her. The Elephant Bar is such a beautiful restaurant with great art all over the place that you can experience and eat well too.",

    "text": "BEWARE THE HAPPY HOUR!  Went here for the \"happy hour\" from 9pm to close. When walking in we waited about 5 minutes before the hostess came to seat us. Once seated the waiter Edgar who was very polite asked for our drink orders. After receiving drinks he asked if we were ready to order which I replied we were and just wanted to stick with appetizers and share. We ordered 5 different appetizers to share since the sign when walking in said shareable apps for $6. Then we ordered off the happy hour menu that was given to us at our table. We ordered a few drinks finished our meal ordered some dessert and then got the bill. We were shocked to see the bill because we were charged full price for everything. Then when we asked the waiter why we were charged full price he said that happy hour is only for the bar and he would check with the manager to see if he can discount the bill. The manger came over and said that this happens all the time and it's both partys fault??? He did discount the bill but we should have received it at the happy hour prices.   Elephant Bar  Management - if you are going to have happy hour only at the bar then place it on the board where you are advertising it in the lobby. Also, why would you give a happy hour menu to the guest sitting in the dining area if it's only for the bar?  We did enjoy the food.   1. Coconut shrimp was a little dry but was tasty. 2. Nachos were typical nacho, nothing to run home about 3. Lettuce wraps were amazing!! Green sauce sweet and delicious. 4. Potato skins were good 5. Buffalo chicken dip was really good",

On this visit I tried the Pineapple chipotle margarita which was amazing, I highly recommend this drink!!  I ordered the Nachos with chicken, as well as the Hawaiian Ahi Tuna, both on the Appetizer menu.  The serving for the Nachos was generous, but my only critique will be how dry the chicken was. The Ahi tuna was amazing just needed extra parmesan chips which we got upon request.  The Happy hour pricing is only available at the Bar area, FYI.  I was very impressed with the attentiveness of our server, I'll definitely be back again.",

As first timers, my boyfriend ask what the restaurant is all about. The waitress brushes the question off by just explaining the menu is two sided and it flips over. Thanks Captain Obvious . The Mai Tais were unbelievably good and half off because it was Mai Tai Mondays. We started with the green beans and the pot stickers. The green beans were pretty good and the pot stickers weren't anything to rave about. I ordered the street tacos and the boyfriend ordered the trout. He had food envy. The tacos were delicioso. The trout was drought! Overall, we left full and overall pretty satisfied.",

I think he was actually a bartender and just had to take a table? Let me just say the food was AMAZING but Jordan's service was HORRIBLE. He took our order with his arms crossed leaning up against the wall, he acted like we were such a inconvience to him. Our food took about 47 minutes to come out and it was messed up. Probably cause he never wrote anything down or even apologized. He never refilled our drinks. A Busser came by and asked if we would like another drink.  He came and dropped the check and never said a word. Didn't ask how our food was or anything. We are both servers on the strip and I WOULD NEVER TREAT A GUEST LIKE AN INCONVENIENCE. I will never go back there again and I'm going to be sure to tell all my friends and coworkers to avoid this place. Really a bummer too.",

I wasn't falling all over myself for it but it was tasty.  The bread tray that they present you with upon ordering isn't your typical rolls and butter. They serve you several different choices of bread and the butter options aren't bad either.

Happy Hour is a plus...  however this was the first time dining here in my home town...A few industry folks met for lunch here and had a nice experience - mainly because of our server...Cynthia (dark hair, kinda short) was wonderful and handled our myriad speical requests with ease...some of us can be quite a pain (dietary stuff, hold this, extra that) and demanding (refills please!)...anyway - she was great, funny, cute and quick to help.  Food was pretty decent (as usual), we ordered a few aps - fried shrimp and all had entrees (I had mahi fish and chips how can you go wrong)...our server was also good at getting us into cocktails -thankfully becuase i really wanted one but was waiting to see if the others dove in - she made it happen!

You have the option to order nearly any type of food you could want, from mexican to chinese and everywhere in between.  The main issue I have with the place is that due to the large menu of options, almost everything is frozen, fried, canned, or stuff with preservatives.  Personally, I prefer fresh, simple food with a few options specifically chosen for that restaurant.  But this can be a decent place to go with family or friends for some drinks and food, and you can be certain it will be served friendly and clean.",

We've eaten here probably 10-15 times. As a good standby item that's inexpensive and fast, the coconut shrimp appetizer is pretty spot on. For something heavier, the lamb shank is also a win.   I gave it only 4 stars because the service always leaves something to be desired. It's not the servers per se, but we have had to wait for a table sometimes when there was no one waiting, and plenty of tables open. Also have seen management staff speaking unprofessionally at times to other staff, within earshot of patrons.",

These are items you'll have to try for yourself coming here. The Thai High chicken salad is BOMB! It has so much flavor in the chicken that it makes the salad more enjoyable. We also ordered a rack of ribs and pizza (for the kids) and my husband ordered the rib eye. The rib eye alone is so tender and delicious, you don't need to add any steak sauce to it. The rack of ribs was so tender it was falling off the bone! Definitely recommend it if you love Ribs! Our waitress tonight was Lucy and she was on top of her game! Very very attentive and sweet. Never forgot any of our orders or requests. Really took care of us tonight. Best customer service I've gotten from this place yet! Thanks Lucy for being so awesome! For sure, my family and I are coming back! Thanks Elephant Bar!",

    "text": "Generally shunning chains in favor of local novelties, Elephant Bar vaguely known as a failed branch once occupied space at a local mall back home, it was on the invitation of Rosie Gillam that three friends sat down to taste the restaurant's newly debuted Brunch menu, conditions that an honest opinion be offered based on the overall experience with a particular focus on the food.  Unabashedly rooted in its theme, a large pachyderm and giraffe statues overlooking the foyer as well as the adjoining bar, Elephant Bar Henderson is located in The District at Green Valley Ranch at the end nearest the Casino and managed by Mr. Mike Tuttle who has overseen operations at several locations over the course of a dozen years, there is little doubt that management long-ago learned to take care of its employees, our waitress a nine year veteran despite her young age while several others have worked nearly a decade at the space.  Genuinely a happy feeling family eatery, the global cuisine admittedly all over the place with obvious \"something for everyone\" intent, a first look at the Elephant Bar menu reads much less elaborately than other chains looking to sell their items with hyperbole, signatures and dietary discretions indicated by icons with additional verbiage limited to method and content.  Bopping IHeartRadio standards, volumeless ESPN on screens in the Bar, it was with warm greetings from a server prone to \"Hun\" and \"My Lady\" that the table was greeted and with suggestions for signatures offered an order was composed to take place in three courses, a total of eleven plates showing far better than many have suggested though a few of the newer selections certainly need to be tweaked or reworked.  Starting out with \"Shareables,\" plenty of coffee, water and iced tea  refilled readily while the table dined and conversed with Mr.Tuttle, first bites of French Onion Ribeye Sliders showed a decent grade of meat topped in Swiss Cheese with caramelized Onions, the 'au jus' a bit oversalted and mostly unnecessary while sauces accompanying the Crispy Green Beans and Coconut Shrimp were equally flavor-marring, the parmesan crust alone making the former irresistibly crave-worthy while the later was already quite sweet without the \"Pan-Pacific\" sauce included for dipping.  Looking at Braised Lamb Shank as a bold move for such a restaurant, their 2014 bankruptcy and subsequent purchase by Chalak Mitra group no doubt contributing several flavors familiar to Southern Asia and India to the spread, it was on the strong words of Mike that the re-launched lunch optioned was ordered and with a falling-from-the bone texture combined to a deep sapor it turns out that the General Manager was spot-on in his recommendation, each bite as rich as expected with necessary levity added by steamed spinach.  Impressed by the Angus burger with Blue Cheese and Pears, the beef soon to be upgraded to Prime per management, items from the Brunch Section were soon delivered in the form of a duo, the Raspberry Passion Pancakes fluffy with buttermilk flavors that help to prevent passion fruit from overwhelming while the Sunrise Breakfast Tostadas are unfortunately *far* to rich to be enjoyable, the tortillas holding up better than the table's tastebuds to the mixture of bacon, peppers, onions, eggs and layer-upon-layer of thick, salty cheese.  Informing the GM and waitstaff of the Tostadas' issues, the comments appearing to be taken seriously and passed on to the Chef, dessert was composed of two Elephant Bar Signatures plus the Brunch-Only French Toast-Butter Cake Sandwich - the Cobbler and Cast-Iron Cookie each hitting all the right notes beneath melting ice cream while thin slices of Cream-Cheese infused cake were mostly lost between bread, the Gooey greatness better appreciated in the classic preparation with toffee sauce and ice cream adding even more richness.  Admitting up front that national chains are not frequently a part of the dining agenda, menu prices alone amusing considering the higher cost generally involved in weekend plans, Elephant Bar suffers many of the flaws frequently associated with such places by attempting to be \"everything to everyone,\" but at the same time manages to execute some pretty complex flavors with a service staff that outperforms many \"celebrity\" spots on the Strip.  Sure the sauces, seasoning and sodium content can tend to be overwhelming, but when taken as a whole there is no doubt that the menu executes better than others in its genre, particularly as relates to plates bearing \"signature\" status.",

I usually get a margarita and the coconut shrimp. Last time I changed it and a sangria mix which was strong. I absolutely had a bit of a buzz after that drink. The bartender seemed very willing to mix other common drinks that weren't on the menu.   This spot is easily a nice choice to hang out and a have a few drinks. Recommend this place for those that want some good drinks and decent appetizers.",

However once I was greeted the service seemed good.  I got a sangria and honestly I would pass on it for the happy hour price next time, maybe their regular drinks are better but for $8-10 for a mediocre drink when there are other bars, and the casino, close by with better pricing they might need to revisit the quality of the drinks prepared.   I ordered the salmon sushi roll from the happy hour and again for the price, quality was a bit lacking. I believe the roll came with 5-6 pieces for $6 ($1 a piece?) and was overly fried so it fell apart and the filling was a little dry but overall I would try it again another night because there was potential. Again, with other restaurants in the area, I think they need to step up their game a little.   I'll have to give this place another try and update my review later because I really wanted to like this place. Maybe I just went on an off night.",

My friends and I were in the area yesterday so we decided to come in here for dinner. Walking in, we were greeted by the friendly hostess who seated us promptly. Our waitress then immediately came by to introduce herself and took our drink orders while we looked over the menu. The menu comprises of a various range of cuisine including Asian, American, Italian, Mexican, etc. Since it was a bit overwhelming to decide on what to get, our waitress was more than happy to give us more time. Once we finally decided on what to eat, we placed our order and the food came out quick and hot. I ordered the shrimp and chicken jambalaya with brown rice and it was delicious and flavorful. My friends enjoyed their food as well. In addition, our waitress was super nice and attentive with checking on us and refilling our drinks.   Elephant Bar is a great spot to sit back and enjoy a meal with great company. Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get a free desert if you purchase an entree. I look forward to coming back again to try their other dishes on the menu. I definitely recommend this place!",

The weather was amazing so we asked to sit on the patio, and was seated right away.  We waited a while before anyone even brought us water.  I kinda felt like they forgot they put us there.  Since I was enjoying the weather and company waiting wasn't so bad.  I ordered a margarita sangria  I haven't stopped thinking about it since lol. It was so mouth watering good.  We had the chicken wrap appetizers. They have 2 sizes, make sure you specify the size you want, if you don't they atomically give you the large. They were yummy, I could eat this as a meal.  Hubby had the prime rib sliders with fries. The meat was very flavorful and tender.  I had a western burger it had bacon, onion rings, and cheese. It was a good size burger, you will be full after eating this.",

We selected the restaurant in Henderson based on several positive reviews and interesting menu items.  We were pleased with the results.  My husband enjoyed his Pub Burger, made with 1/2 lb of beef, bacon, cheddar cheese, and an onion ring.  The fries were well seasoned and tasty.  I ordered the Mandarin Orange Chicken from the \"tastes of the world\" section of the menu.  The spicy orange sauce was delicious and the entree featured a nice variety of stir fried veggies and brown rice.  The waitress was very pleasant and attentive.    The weather was perfect for an outdoor meal on their large and comfortable patio.  Overall, a very enjoyable meal in a lovely setting.  The broad range of menu options was practically inviting us back for another meal.",

It didn't need any of your typical condiments at all!  We also \"checked in\" on Yelp and received a free dessert. We ordered the cheesecake. That cheesecake was one to rival another restaurant that is known for that dessert. It was a New York cheesecake and had definitive hints of lemon. So good!  Through this, Eve's service was exemplary! She was so nice and friendly. She recommended dishes, recommended drinks. She came back and checked how our food was and if we needed anything. Amazing service!  I highly recommend The Elephant Bar, and we look forward to going back again to try more dishes from their menu!",

Also, I hope Elephant Bar's senior leadership reads and takes action on Yelp reviews like my organization does!   We went to eat Sunday and had the absolute best service from Jamie. We were at table 5/1 at 11:56am according to my receipt. Jamie connected immediately with my 3 kids and then promptly pivoted into how to best take care of me!  Her warmth, suggestive sales dialogue (without being a pushy sales person!) and absolute focus on detail is second to none.  She helped optimize our overall order to be the most cost-effective, yet have enough for all of the kids.  She seemed to know exactly what we needed.  The experience she provided combined with the quality food really made the meal special for kids and adult (me) alike!   I'm in the service industry and associates like Jamie are hard to find. She made my day nothing short of perfect and for that, we thank you!",

    "text": "The District has a lot of dining options for everyone depending on what they're in the mood for, ranging from Mediterranean fare and barbecue to burgers, casual dining Chinese and more upscale fare in the nearby Green Vally Ranch. Of these, Elephant Bar bills itself as being a global restaurant serving many dishes and drinks from across the world.  As I write this review I continue to have mixed feelings about this place -- this USED TO BE one of my favorite restaurants in town, until new management came in and made a lot of changes that I didn't appreciate, like the temporary removal of their lamb shanks. I came by with my family for dinner this past Sunday, though, to give them a chance after not going there for so long.  Immediately, I remembered why I stopped coming here -- even though the restaurant wasn't busy, it took far too long for a server to approach us, much less get our food orders. In particular, other parties that came in around the same time we did were getting served faster and got their food sooner than us. Needless to say, we were quite impatient when it came to getting our food -- my order focused on the soy-ginger calamari, their French onion soup, and the ribeye with coconut shrimp.  Another major gaffe occurred when our food came out -- apparently someone on the staff misheard my order, because they brought out ribs instead of the ribeye I ordered! Needless to say, I was angry enough that I seriously considered walking out of the restaurant -- and I would have, had my parents not calmed me down enough that I could explain the error.  To their credit, our server, Patricia, and the manager, Kim, were both very apologetic afterwards, and comped our appetizers along with offering free dessert after our meal, which we accepted. I appreciated the gesture, especially considering that things could have gone very differently had they not attempted to rectify the error. In the end my family and I ended up getting a mud pie dessert to split.  Food-wise, everything was good: the calamari were tender and crisp, and the accompanying salad was light and flavorful. The French onion soup was thick, rich and had plenty of broth and onions. The ribeye was cooked perfectly medium rare and melted in my mouth, and the mud pie was cool and refreshing after how hot it was outside despite it being the evening. My only complaint was with the coconut shrimp; it could have used more coconut, but that's just my preference.  The food was spectacular taste-wise: that I won't dispute. What I do take issue with is the shoddy service -- had Kim and Patricia not rectified the mistake, I would have given this restaurant a one-star review and been done with it. You could serve the best food in the world, and it would mean nothing if your service was non-existent and your staff regularly messed up people's orders. It's little wonder this restaurant is barely busy whenever I look inside -- and that truly is a shame because I enjoyed coming here before. Perhaps if I were feeling up to it, I would return, but after that night's showing I'm not inclined to return anytime soon.",

It wasn't very busy (10pm Thurs) but even so the open kitchen was noisy.  Prompt friendly service.  Veggie burger: mediocre.  Very thin patty.  Provolone cheese option was good. Very hard, dry, thin bun...weird, actually.  Seared tuna with Ponzu sauce appie: Fine. Service on this plate has to be fast because it's on the heat for such a short time & if slow, it arrives cold.  It did.  Mojito Classic (the cheap one): from a mix with token mint leaves added.  Meh.  Cold herb tea ginger drink: good.  It got us in out of the cold, fed us but didn't particularly warm us.

The prices are reasonable and they do offer a free appetizer if you sign up for the loyalty card (took about 3 mins to do) I ordered a mojito to start, it was decent but not made fresh ( I could tell it was a mix) We also had the spinach and artichoke dip as our appetizer along with an order of sweet potato fries the dip was very bland and the fries we fine, the rest of dinner was pretty much the same. It was good but nothing that would bring me back for a second visit. The service was good and the food is okay if that's what your looking for. I personally like my food to have a little more character.     I would come back if invited but probably by choice. I feel this area has so much more to offer as far as food choices are concern. Thanks for an average dinner but I'll take my money else where.",

The food is not anything to write home about, they might as well be a sports bar, because all they did well was the fried stuff. My sister hated her dish, and to top it all off they never recognized my husbands birthday, which was why we went there in the first place.

What I find confusing was that the decor and menu didn't match. The menu had Chinese, Thai, and american food but the decor was an African safari theme. What I enjoyed the most were their ribs. For not being a BBQ place their ribs were very good. It had a good amount of smoke, spice, and sweetness. The rest of the food I had was just OK. The service was kinda slow and my waitress did not know what she had on tap. To me, if you're going to assign a person to a party, you better make sure she know's what types of beers you have unless you're a beer garden then it's ok not to remember everything. Also, I noticed that there were Asian cooks so that's a good sign that the Asian food might be good. Overall, I would come back to hang out at the bar and eat the ribs.",

They split the tables and have each table a different server which is expected and not a problem at all with such a large group. Half of my table ordered food. I was not hungry so I didn't order anything besides a beer. I didn't even take two sips out of my beer and the waiter had already brought the check to me and my friend who ordered beer and an app. By the time the food was there he was he came along with the other checks and after he rushed to collect the tabs he ignored us for the rest of the night. Its okay though he saved me from wasting more money at this place with awful service. Didn't try the food so that's why it's 2 stars.",

Once sat at our table, we were greeted by an extremely energetic waiter that spoke a mile a minute that thought he needed to emphasize that everything was AWESOME. (including my side of avocado that he dropped off later during service) Once we ordered our cocktails I realized it was super cold in the restaurant. So we asked to be re-sat outside. (which 5 min later two other ladies complained and did the same thing). My boyfriend and I started with the \"sashimi\" grade tuna appetizer. The tuna was warm, chewy and grainy. GROSS! So we quickly returned the item in fear for food poisoning. We then replaced it with the spinach and artichoke dip. How could you go wrong with cheese dip?? Blagggh! The cheese was awful and we dug around the dip to find ONE artichoke! So, we wanted to be nice and just pushed it to the side. Shortly after, our salad came out. We were excited to eat the salad because it actually looked appetizing. BUT, we received no silverware. So as we waited for our super speedy awesome waiter to come back to ask for silverware, our burger arrived. Aggggh! So now I have a hot burger that I need to eat and no time at all to eat my salad. As my boyfriend is putting on the jalepeno relish he finds a piece of paper in the relish. Geeezus! So by then we were irritated and asked for a manager. They comp'd our meal but, crappy waiter, REALLY crappy food. Won't ever be back.",

    "text": "I ate at the Elephant Bar last night for the first time in nearly two years.  I have always liked the bar area, and that is where I usually sit.  The beer prices are pretty high ($5.25 for just a pint!), but much of the menu is now reasonably priced.  I noticed the menu is WAY different than it used to be, with a lot of cheaper options.  I got the Garlic Noodles with Sauteed Shrimp, and it wasn't very good.  It was on par with something you'd get at a cheap Chinese restaurant, but more expensive.  My wife enjoyed her salad, and the service was just fine.  It used to be that it was really difficult to find a seat in the bar area on Saturday nights, and you could count on a long wait for a table.  But last night wasn't all that busy, perhaps because the quality of food and service has slipped.  I'm giving it three stars because I used to think that the food here was pretty good, but maybe things have changed.",

Anyway, they love this place and have a few favorite dishes they say are delicious and keep them coming back- along with a 20% discount for seniors they get there.  My first impressions aside from the place being empty at 3pm was the decor was tasteful and inviting. We had a nice half circle booth.  Our waiter showed up immediately and provided very good service throughout the meal.  I ordered the \"Ultimate bacon cheeseburger\" with fries. My parents shared some chicken parmesian medallions with pasta dish which they said was very good. Looked good to me- nice portion size and presentation.  My burger was pretty darn good. Half pound patty done medium well with bacon, cheddar and all the usual trimmings. I think they used a slice of sweet vadalia onion which gave a nice sweet note to every bite. Overall a very good burger that I can easily recommend. A nice size serving of seasoned fries were a nice addition to the meal- very crispy hot and tasty.  Prices here seemed to be very reasonable as well. My burger was only $8.95 and looking at the menu, most sandwiches were in that range with full dinners mostly under $20. Seriously most of their meals were cheaper than you'd find at a Denny's or similar.  I'd definitely give this place another visit. Seems like a good place for a casual date that wouldn't stress your credit card.",

I was impressed how the menu had so many ethnic foods and so many options to choose from. The service was great, our waitress kept checking in on us and made sure everything was perfect. The food was mediocre but i still enjoyed it. I had the misoyaki salmon and my friend had the jambalaya. The salmon was delicious, but then again i love salmon and love it in any way it was prepared. As for the jambalaya it was not too impressive it was just ok. We also had a spinach and artichoke dip for appetizers and that too was just ok. Over all i just give an A-OK, the service was great and the food was just A-OK, The onyl way i would go back is if someone really wanted to eat here. Maybe next time i will try the bar area and try their bar foods..",

My husband ordered street tacos that were so soggy that they looked like they had been served in cheap paper towels, and the medium rare steak my son ordered was cooked to medium well perfection served with instant mashed potatoes & rubbery frozen veggies. This place used to be decent and we were regulars, but it has gone significantly downhill over the last few visits. Tonight was definitely our last visit here.

He seemed to want to be our buddy a little too much. Don't get me wrong, he got our orders right, was prompt, refilled our drinks, even ASKED if he could refill my iced tea, which I appreciated, but somehow seemed a little incongruent to the restaurant.  Hard to explain. He may have been new there as he wasn't expert on the menu. Still...A for effort.  He did a good job trying to encourage us for dessert (which we ultimately declined).  The food was fine. I had the Philly Cheese Steak. Portion size was good, may have been slightly under-seasoned. French fries were quite good.  Good value for money.  I thought it was curious that they served burgers and sandwiches...and asian/wok cuisine.  I was briefly tempted to add a side of fried rice to my Philly but ultimately passed.  There is no breakfast menu.",

    "text": "This was the first time we ate at this location (been to the DC, CA in Serramonte, on several occasions). I'd say 3.5 stars. The nervous server was new at this, and you could tell, because he kept messing up our order. Ok, after he admitted it, we felt bad for him, so we didn't want to give him a hard time.   What I ordered was very good: the smokehouse sandwich, chicken, lettuce, tomato, BBQ sauce, cheese, and onion strings on a bun (similar to Red Robin). It was a little messy, though. I usually hate messy, but it was so good, I dismissed it. My husband ordered the Philly but found the peppers were a little too spicy for him (he asked the server before ordering, if the peppers were mild or hot), so we ended up splitting. I didn't taste it until I ditched some of the bread. My FIL also ordered the Philly without mushrooms and hot peppers, and didn't like the heat, either, but ate it anyway, because he thought he could ignore it, if he ate it fast enough. His wife, had the Pastrami on a roll; it came with coleslaw but it wasn't overleaded with it, and the meat was lean, too. We also ordered the appetizer combo, which came after our entrees: artichoke and spinach dip with chips, chicken tenders (panko), shrimp (also in panko), and bruschetta slices. I didn't like the dip, it was overly thick for me, but my husband and my FIL dug in. The shrimp and chicken was really good, but everything was getting a little too heavy for me. I had to stop eating.   I like the ambiance (fun jungle theme), the food concept (world fusion), and the circular bar in the middle front of the dining area. This place was busy; there was a steady influx of patrons. It's a popular place.    Maybe our experience might have been better if our server wasn't so new; he did apologize, though. My FIL and his wife had eaten here a couple years back, and didn't like it. My husband and I thought the one in Daly City was better.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and i decided to try out this place because he had a good experience at a location out of state. We went in for happy hour and we were excited about it because the happy hour menu had a nice variety of things to try. Lets start with drinks - First round I had the Raspberry Lemon Drop Martini and it was really good. My boyfriend had the Mojito and it was good also. Second round i had the Sangria Blanco and it was AWFUL. It tasted like watered down sprite with a couple of fruits in it.   Food - We had the Tempura Salmon Roll, Calamari, Artichoke Dip. The Salmon Roll was so gross and spongy tasting. I mean, i think i deserve that for ordering something like that outside of a sushi spot. The Calamari was just OK. Definitely nothing special. The Artichoke Dip was really watery, I'm not use to my artichoke dip being like that. We even let it cool, and it still stayed pretty watery. So, you figure we would of just gave up after three strikes, but my boyfriend was still hungry and so he ordered the pretzels. It was a little burnt, but it was okay. Can't go too wrong with a pretzel. It seems like we weren't the only people that didn't care too much for the food because we saw some people in the dining room send back their food.  At the end when we paid, we got our bill back with someone elses credit card. A mistake of course, but we made sure to keep our receipt just in case. I really wanted this to be on my list of great happy hours because the menu for happy hour has so much, which is nice....but it didn't make and has been kicked off my HH list. My boyfriend and i definitely won't be going back.",

I really liked the area- it's right across from Green Valley Ranch in one of those village-looking outdoor shopping centers.  This means the surroundings were pleasant to look at and there wasn't a ton of car traffic.   I can't say I was impressed by what I ate.  I had salmon sushi and it wasn't all that. To be fair, I'm not a fan of warm sushi. Room temperature is good for me, but at least the salmon was freshly cooked, right?  I ordered a wedge salad and was sorely disappointed to the point of not even eating all of it.  Heck, I can hack a head of iceberg lettuce in half and throw some blue cheese next to it for much cheaper.  Not worth the price.  My meal was actually not memorable.    Would I come back? I would definitely give it another try because the service was nice and the surroundings were pleasant. I'd like to try the dining room, as it looked nicely put together.  I hope the food is worth it!",

I wouldn't have gone this time but a group of friends wanted to get together, and they picked Elephant Bar. I almost didn't go, but I was willing to take one for the team in order to see some friends. Drinks are okay but pricey. Staff was really pleasant and handled our large table beautifully. We shared some Seared Ahi Tuna apps, it was a little dry and not quality but it was edible. I ordered the Crispy Orange Shrimp with rice, the flavor was there but the shrimp were not crispy, and the rice was bad...I can tell it's been sitting in a container drying out and clumping. Yuck. My husband got the NY Steak sandwich, (it doesn't come with a top bun) and about 10 fries. He ate it and said it was okay, not the best he had but he would eat it again. Oh well, third time will not be the charm unless they drag me in there kicking and screaming.",

We sat at a booth which is technically still part of the bar, so we were able to sit comfortably and still enjoy Happy Hour prices. Plus 1 star! Our server was friendly and did a fantastic job. Plus another star!  However, what doesn't deserve a lot of stars is the food. The food is average, nothing to rave about. We ordered the following appetizers:  Sweet Potato Fries- Not crispy enough  Quick-Fried Soy-Ginger Calamari- Needed a few more minutes in the deep fryer as the thick calamari pieces were soggy. I love calamari, but Elephant Bar's rendition of my favorite dish wasn't something I loved.   Warm & Spicy Artichoke Dip- Average dip and average chips. I enjoyed the chips more than I enjoyed the dip.   Quick Seared Ahi Tuna- I enjoyed the pieces of peppered tuna over a bed of mixed greens dressed with a soy/sesame oil concoction. One of the better appetizers of the night.    Vietnamese Shrimp Spring Rolls- Not good at all. The rice wrapper was soggy and the filling (especially the shrimp) was boring and sparse. The mango/bell pepper/lettuce salad had an unusual cilantro-y dressing that was way too sweet.   Tempura Salmon Roll- The best appetizer of the night. Teriyaki salmon wrapped up in rice and nori, and then deep fried in a light tempura batter. Crunchy, soft, and delicious.   It's hard to believe that out of all those appetizers, only one left a good impression on me. Elephant Bar isn't my first choice when I'm in the neighborhood hungry.",

The reason behing the 5 stars is that my small non-profit had been looking for a party location (25 people) for a while, and not one restaurant in The District offered us a decent deal (some wanted $1500 to rent the patio for a few hours). However, Kevin at Elephant Bar really hooked up up, met with me and the organization's president, and went out of his way to make our event a great one. No charge to use the patio (just for us) on a Thursday night, we got 2 dedicated servers, and he even extended happy hour for us! He also allowed us to bring in a cake and decorations and even printed a special menu for us with the apps we had chosen. All in all, it was a fantastic experience and my little non-profit is very grateful. We ended up spending roughly $600 and all our out-of-town guests were delighted. They liked the food, the service, the good drink selection and the patio.   Thank you so much for a job well done and for supporting small non-profits.",

I have been here so many times, mostly with my Tuesday dinner posse, but a few times with friends and the bf, and gosh...the service here is sooooooooooo bad!  A few general observations: the restaurant does not like to accommodate parties larger than 4....and when you call ahead even, to put 2 tables together takes so long that you get to wait an hour!!! (on a Tuesday no less!)  Happy hour prices @the bar: starts at 9 PM so you can't even order a happy hour drink until that very minute...at least give waters while people wait!  Then the portions on the half off stuff is definitely smaller - but that was never divulged (ordering an entree salad and getting a few shrimp instead of 6-8 is a no-no!!)  Ohhhh the ironic thing is one night I was not feeling well and craved the only thing I ever order there - the macau shrimp and noodle soup and salmon sushi roll combo....and it was actually bad.  I had to hunt down someone for soy sauce.  My bf laughed at me bc the one night I actually craved elephant bar, it was again terrible and he had wanted to go to Cheesecake Factory.  Last night my bf asked, \"Do you want to go to elephant bar?\" and I told him just thinking about eating there made my skin crawl - he laughed and said he was kidding...so we went to PF Chang's (ahhhh I mentioned 2 other chains in this review).  Long story short - don't eat here.  Food is eh (my mom even tried it when she visited me and the French dip is nasty), service is bad, and the hostess doesn't like you.",

    "text": "Decent for what it is - Solid 3 Stars!  Elephant Bar is a chain restaurant that caters to \"Global Cuisine\".  Atmosphere seems as if you're on a safari, dim lighting and animal-esque motifs surrounding you.   Came here for lunch with my grandma (FYI = if you're a senior, you can sign up for their discount program, allowing you to get 20% off your bill!) because she was craving their \"LETTUCE WRAPS\", which I must say was decent.   For those of you on a diet or just watching what you eat, they offer a \"lighter side\" on their menu options. I don't understand why this section of the menu is placed towards the back where the desserts and beverages are listed. Oh well! I had opted for the Quick Seared Ahi Tuna Salad (in their lighter side menu) which was quite filling for a huge plate of salad! My Ahi Tuna was cooked just right.   Service here was great! I wasn't ignored, yet smothered.   Overall, the food is okay. Nothing \"OMG\" about, but decent for the price you pay.  Nonetheless, only going here if my grandma want's to go. Or if I have friends that feel like going to the bar!",

The food is delicious, has a wonderful presentation,  always served in generous portions, and is reasonably priced.  Their service has always been excellent with a very attentive and friendly staff. We have brought friends and family to this restaurant as well and every time each visit has been a positive dining experience. The atomsphere is pleasant and well maintained.  They also offer an outside seating area if you enjoy that type of experience.  Unfortunately,  some people have given this place some lower review ratings. I find it comical when reading other patrons reviews and hearing what their complaints actually consist of.... Example: \"too many items on the menu to choose from\",   \"I don't like laminated menus\",  \"you get too much food\",   \"I felt overwhelmed with their menu\".  Absolutely hysterical to hear people actually complain about things like that!  That only goes to show you that you can never please everybody!   Perhaps MacDonald's would be a better choice for their taste in general...",

The first time, we ordered the chicken marsala and cream of asparagus soup.  FABULOUS.  Also, Elephant Bar has extraordinary iced tea.  The second time, my fiance duplicated his original order and I got a weeeeeeeeird salad with basil leaves in it.  His order, which was so great the time before, was super bland and the sauce was really lumpy.  My salad was utterly disgusting.  More than half the salad was basil leaves rather than lettuce.  Sure, I expected the basil, but as a complement to the salad itself... not that the basil itself was the salad!  The people who gave us the gift card have some notion that Elephant Bar is our favorite restaurant (not sure why), so I bet we'll be getting another gift card for the next major occasion.  It's a very Seinfeld-ish of situation.  That's the only reason I would likely return.  I really value consistency when I dine out... it's a major bummer when you come back for something (like my fiance's chicken marsala), only to feel like you're eating a completely different dish.",

There have been times that I got the wrong order and it was because the server could not hear me either.  They have always made it right for us.  The Creme Brule' is amazing.  Kids love it because of the animals in the lobby and parents love it because the kids can be loud.  They serve ice cream with the kids meals so they love that and the parents probably have kids bouncing off the walls all night. :)",

    "text": "Summary: Not seated, not waited on, had to take menus off of another table. (And the place was practically empty) After 15-20 minutes finally we just left, hungry, no one even tried to serve us!  My Experience: I walked in alone with my 14 month old daughter at around 9:20pm. Just as we were walking in I saw someone leave the hostess area. In the restaurant area had only 2-3 tables of people... the bar area had about 10 people the place was near deserted. So I waited... had my daughter walk around the reception area... had her look at the elephant... the giraffes.... the plants... a waitress walks by and smiles at her... nobody even talks to us or tries to seat us. At least two of the waitresses saw us. I finally asked the waitress if I can sit in the bar area with a child for happy hour, she happily says \"Yes, and you can sit in the lower tables just outside so she won't fall\". Nobody comes. I grab a happy hour menu from the bar... waitresses see us... try to grab a full menu from the hostess desk and give up because they are under the desk. Wait and have the waitress look right at me but not say anything to me at all. My daughter started to fuss and I just gave up and walked out! 15-20 minutes. I have been to Elephant Bars many times and loved every experience, but this location was absolutely ridiculous.   I am giving them 2 stars for the benefit of a doubt that the hostess was on break and because the waitress spoke nicely to me.",

We decided on The Elephant Bar despite several friends telling us the food was terrible.  I usually don't write reviews unless the business is extraordinarily amazing or awful...this place is definitely classified as awful in my book.  My husband ordered a chicken/tri-tip combo plate, which didn't look anything like the picture.  The chicken was marinated in some sort of sauce that tasted like the smell of dirty feet; the tri-tip was not very good either.  I ordered the Misoyaki Salmon, which was very dry and the sauce was average.  The veggies were soaked in oil and appeared to be the frozen kind you throw in a saucepan.  My husband is not a very picky eater, but even he agreed he would never come back.  We should have trusted our instincts and celebrated at the places we know are good...Lucille's, Cheesecake Factory, GVR Cafe or even Al's Garage (bar food) put this place to shame.  Don't waste your time... And now I know why such a 'high class' place puts out so many coupons.  This place was also totally overpriced for the quality...my meal alone was $17+ and I only ate probably a third of it.",

The food, on the other hand, is just sort of...blah.  No, it wasn't necessarily bad, it was just very bland.  My mom and I split the grilled shrimp salad (don't remember what it was called, but I think it was supposed to be Asian-influenced), and the catfish fillet with mango salsa.  The salad was pretty good, but how can you really go wrong with grilled shrimp and salad?    The fish, however, was completely flavorless.  It was like they didn't bother to season it AT ALL - no salt, no pepper, no nothing.  The only time my taste buds had anything to do at all was when I took a bite of fish with the mango salsa (thank goodness for mango salsa!).  The rice wasn't even good.  It was so dry and flavorless, with each grain scattered across the plate trying to escape from one another.  I like my rice fluffy and soft, with just enough moisture for all the grains to want to stick together.  To be fair, I wasn't really expecting much from the food here, so I can't say I was terribly disappointed.  Since I live in New York, I probably won't ever return to Elephant Bar.  It's almost funny to me how memorably bland the food was.  Then again, I should have known better, because you can't spell \"bland\" without B-A-D.",

The place is perfect for a nice dinner out, we sat for over an hour and it felt like 20 minutes, the feel, lighting and service was above what I expected. Our waitress was great; Lucy acted like we were her only customers even though there were plenty of full tables in her area. I never had to ask for a refill on my drink, as soon as I was close to empty she was bringing another to the table, she suggested her favorite dishes in all categories and was polite and attentive throughout the meal but not overbearing. I will definitely come back to this place again.",

    "text": "I've been to a few different Elephant Bars and one thing seems common between all of them - inconsistency.  Some nights I'll order the teriyaki chicken and it will be GREAT. Other times it is lacking flavor or tastes like it was microwaved quickly. It's a shame, because when it's good - it's GOOD.  I love their salads (tropical citrus adventure) and the coconut fried shrimp skewers are great (the sauce makes them that much more amazing). I've ordered the Tempura Salmon Roll and Pan Asian Soup with Teriyaki Chicken Skewer ($9.95) a number of times and it usually hits the spot, but I've always wished the soup had more flavor and maybe less (or smaller) veggies. Sometimes the Roll is great, other times it makes me wish I'd ordered something else!  The alcohol is measured in every drink here, so I'd recommend ordering a beer that compliments whatever you're eating. You're paying for a watery beverage with close to no alcohol otherwise.  I recommend ordering an appetizer or two as a meal, or going with the Pacific Rim Specialties. These are normally the best.  I was excited to see lobster ravioli on the menu once (it's not a regular menu item) and didn't hesitate to order it. Unfortunately, I found the ravioli to be COLD and the sauce was rather bland. I probably could've gone to Costco and made better lobster ravioli from a bag.  If you're planning on ordering the Jambalaya, go during the lunch special when it's almost $5 cheaper and it's fresh. It's not the best jambalaya (I've had tons of jambalaya in Louisiana) - but it's decent with a good amount of shrimp, usually.  One thing I like about this place is that they give gift cards all of the time. If you go in and buy someone else a $10 gift card - you get at least a $5 gift card. I was with a friend and we wanted to buy our boss a gift card for $20. We each got a $5 gift card. They also give you Elephant Bar cards you can use during lunch for a discount on the total bill.  All in all, if you're near the district and you're hungry - stop in during the lunch special and eat something. Don't order alcohol unless it's beer, and don't eat outside by the gate opening. People walk in and out of that thing and it slams so hard/loud that your experience there will be ruined!",

The staff wears pretty cool safari type shirts with denim bottoms.  We were greeted at the door and promptly seated in the back just off the kitchen.  There were 5 of us and apparently this was the only place for us!?  Whatever our food got to us quicker I suppose.  We were lucky that there was someone in training so we had 2 servers.  We were asked what we wanted to drink and quite quickly we got our beverages.  Placed our order with ease.  The servers did a good job.  I ordered a dinner salad and baked potato as my entree.  The salad was fine, nothing special.  My stuffed baked potato was good but the outside had been burnt with crispy black spots on it.  Such a let down.  We spilt one tortilla soup and I can say it was really quite good.    I'm not overly impressed by this place.  It's pretty ordinary something like an Applebee's type place.  Everything appeared to be pre measured.  Would only come back if I have to because of work or drinks.",

Just recently I have been suggesting Elephant Bar. It hasn't let me down yet. Great mixture of dining and you can mix it up with a burger if you want. Salmon is also on the menu.   If you are with a group and no one can agree upon what they have a taste for, this is the spot. Only here can someone order salmon, burger and fries and Mongolian Beef under the same roof.

Pluses: really cool decorations, it's got the african safari look going on, and it looks beautiful  minues: the food is not that great. we got the korean ribs and chicken breast and chicken thai dinner. both were ok. I mean, they didn't taste bad...but they weren't really good either. I felt like i was eating it because i need a filler for my stomach, but I never craved the next bite...which isn't what you want to be feeling when your out to eat.   Also, our waiter had THE WORST TIMING. And kept doing it. It's like she was trying to rush us out of there even though the restaurant was 70% empty. For example, my husband and I are in the middle of our dinner prayer, and she comes up, asked if were ready to order, and stands there...no excuse me no apology...kind of rude. Then as were eating out dinner, food still out our plates, she asked if were done with our food and if we want a box? Um what?--No i want to eat my food--go away.",

How unfortunate because this is one of my go to places in California (Torrance location ROCKS). It's too bad the service here isn't even close to what I've experienced at other locations.",

The decor and atmosphere is intimate and romantic - dim lighting, cool African-safari-themed art on the walls, etc.  I had the Gardenburger and sweet potato fries for my meal, and it was completely delicious.  I also ordered a mojito - and, as I say, I've never met a mojito I didn't like; this one was particularly delicious!  Although there's a specific recipe on the menu, they'll flavor-infuse your mojito with any number of fruit options; I chose pomegranate, and it was Amazing.  The waitress was very friendly, provided recommendations for us, and was very attentive to us the entire time we were there.  I never got to the bottom of my glass of water (in my mind, a clear sign of great service!).  In addition, the street surrounding this restaurant is beautiful and intimate, especially at night; lights strung from tree to tree, brick street, and classy shopping and eating venues.  (Definitely a fantastic date option!)  Can't wait to come back here again!",

Our appetizer dishes, coconut shrimp and the artichoke dip were very tasty and delicious. Unfortunately all the other dishes were lack luster. From the Ahi Poke, Clam Chowder Soup, Chicken Sandwich, Philly Cheese steak, and Orange Chicken all failed to have enough seasoning or meet our expectations. Our server was also very absent minded and rarely was around. We had to look for her to get random items or refills. All we kept hearing is \"hold on a second\". Unfortunately this restaurant has potential but fails to meet expectations from quality and taste of food. I'm adding an additional star because the manager was willing to hear our feedback and address the issue.",

At first they didn't accepted official foreign ID and asked for my passport (it had been accepted everywhere before). And said that it was not even ID as if I was lying. So my boyfriend went all the way home to get my passport.  While waiting I had to ask the waitress for  water 2!!! times before she brought it. And then when my bf returned we got sushi but there was no soy sauce, so we had to get it ourselves.  When the main dish was served we had to ask 2 times again for utensils.  By that time the food was cold.",

    "text": "Since joining the HR family at my job, they thought it fitting to have a welcome lunch.  We decided on Elephant Bar.    The place is full of dramatic statues of African animals: giraffes and of course, elephants.  It's covered with trees and makes you feel like you're in a small safari.  After a few minutes of waiting, we were sat by the kitchen.  Above our table, the air condition ducts were dripping of condensation.  Too bad it was right above where I was seated, so my entire place on the table was dripping wet.    First thought about their menu: a lot going on, kinda like Cheesecake Factory.  On this day, I got the Santa Barbara burger.  They cooked it medium for me and was seasoned great!  The avocado was what sealed the deal for this burger.  SOOOO good and juicy!  I also loved the zebra print wrapper the burger came in.  With the burger, there was side choices you could choose from.  I chose the caesar salad.  One piece of advice: Don't get crazy with the cheese!  I love cheese, but the parmasean cheese on this salad was just too much!  Out of the 5 years I've been in Vegas, I've only been to Elephant Bar 3 times.  This was my first time dining here.  It was an ok experience, however, I'm curious to try the Macadamia crusted fish and chips, so you best believe I will be back!",

The decor is super cute and right up my alley. I love animal print and safari-style anything, so I was totally in cheetah heaven!   I ordered the Cajun Chicken from their Lighter Side menu. It came with a full cup of rice mixed with spicy sausage. The seasoning on the chicken was perfect-- flavorful but not burn-your-face-off hot. Just how I like it!   Our server Brandon was very friendly and didn't mind that my colleague and I lingered at the table for more than 20 minutes after we finished dining.

You got your choices of salads, grilled foods, chicken, shrimp, and more. They are VERY accommodating to your needs. I had lunch here with a friend who is currently fasting and is on a vegan diet. Our waiter Brandon was very informative on a dish she wanted, but was worried if the dish contained any animal products. He came back and said it did contain some parts, but that the chef could substitute it with something else. How awesome!  Anyways, I had wood fire salmon with cilantro citrus sauce. It was AMAZING! The salmon was perfectly cooked and the vegetables along with sauce just tied everything together making this meal very enjoyable. I even treated myself to a guava cream shake which I see myself ordering again and I don't even like shakes that much.  Bottom line: worth your time.",

It was crowded so it took a little while to get our table and our food, however the decor of the place keeps your mind off of the wait time.    The food is average, I cannot say it was horrible, but it was not memorable enough to say that it was fantastic.  There are many other choices of places to eat, however, if I find myself in an area with an Elephant Bar, I know what to expect going in.  I know the staff vary from place to place, I have been here once before and sat in the bar with a friend and I can say the bartendar, a young girl was not the most pleasant.  She was nice and took care of us, but her sense of humor was not a warm and welcoming persoanlity, it is like she was there because it was a job and nothing more.    If you are hungry this is not a bad place and know you will get ok food here, but do not expect a gourmet meal.  Friendly service is a toss up by place and person you deal with I guess, but like I said I would go here again if needed.",

The entire time we needed more water for my table, our glasses were empty the majority of the time we were there. I said yes we would like dessert and he left and talked to the hostess again and then just brought my bill.  When clearly I said yes we would like dessert.  He waited on another table alongside us more frequently and they came after us and left before us because they got served better. I am a foodie and love to try new places.  I was recommended to come here by my coworker.  And I must say,  I am not impressed by the service. The one star is for the great food.  But I believe any food can taste great with great service. I made reservations and my party felt ignored the entire time.  Also, it doesn't help that today is my BIRTHDAY. What a bummer!  Maybe I'll return.  Not any time soon.  Just for the food.  Not for the service. I have a huge balloon and gifts by me.  Clearly...  It's my birthday.  Just saying.  I have added 2 more stars after posting this one because my friend spoke to the manager while I was at the restroom and they apologized and comped our entire meal.  I may be returning in the future.",

The menu gave a number of options for each selection which is always nice for a happy hour, yet the description of the food wasn't there. They don't give regular size menus during happy hour unless you ask. My friend and I both ordered the sparkling cucumber colada, which I recommend to anyone trying this place and can't decide on a drink. I later ordered their margarita which was good not the best but I've definitely had worse. Going there simply for the drinks alone is worth the trip, the food I'd stay clear. My friend order the Chicken Potstickers which she loved and wouldn't stop talking about them, also the Tempura Salmon Roll which was fired and wasn't a great texture mixture. She ended up taking the salmon rolls home and trashing them. I ordered the Zesty Artichoke Dip which was really good and had great chunks of artichoke, I originally started with the Chicken Lettuce Wrap but my food came cold and I switched to the Chicken Tenders which where by far the blandest thing I've ever taste. It honestly tasted as if they took it out of the bag and just fried it, no flavor what so ever. Our server wasn't at the top of his game either, it took almost 15 minutes to order and when we need something it was a matter of getting it from another table or just hunting him down. I don't think either of us will be going back.",

I had a yummy agave margarita for $9. It was tasty. I much prefer a margarita made without sour mix and with the good stuff.  We had the calamari for an appetizer. It was delightful. It was was cooked perfectly tender and mixed with arugula. It was drizzled with a creamy flavorful sauce. Loved it.  We ordered kids past with meat sauce. It was delicious.  Meaty, flavorful and cooked nicely. Boys ate every bit.  Hubby had the misoyaki salmon with mashed potatoes and veggies and raves about it.  I had the outstanding pistachio crusted cod sandwich with Asian slaw and a cup of clam chowder. The sandwich was flavorful, tender and divine. The clam chowder was up there with the best I've ever had. No skimping on big clams and the perfect amount of acid. Seriously, we were so pleasantly surprised!  We had lovely services. Friendly smiles everywhere.  We will be back and sooner rather than later this time. Great happy hour happening in the bar too.",

They have a wide variety of choies- I've only sampled a couple of them- the misoyaki salmon is rich. And the Yalkisoba noodles are another level. SERIOUSLY. The macau shrimp and noodles, lemon garlic chicken breast are all solid choices too. I will say that my favorite pick is always the Korean street tacos. I just can't get over the delish combinations of the marinade, sour cream, avocado, cabbage, and that outstanding salsa. With brown rice? Yum!   It's pretty obvious that I really enjoy coming here but I don't usually care for the really dark ambience, the outdated upholstery on the booths and chairs, or how there is usually one person for the whole floor of the restaurant. We've been there time and time again and it's always the same test of patience. But when my friends and i go, we'll go with our tummies just about hungry. So it's okay. Happy hour is good, and they're adding more and more lunch specials and brunch specials. I'll be at the elephant bar, just with more initial thirst than hunger.",

Two reasons.   1) Becuase I've never been here before  2) My wife and I were looking for something close to the house and chill.   I usually want a divey spot or \"hip\" bar to have that last drink at, but we wanted something different and without expectations, a chain restaurant bar it is! We sat down and realized we were the youngest people in here by at least 15 years; this is for sure the happy hour spot for life long secretaries, office workers, and retirees. Not to be deterred we ordered a drink and planned the next move in case this place was bunk.   Dani, our bartender, was great! She kept us entertained, our glasses full, and introduced us to some of the regulars. She did what a good bartender does, kept us happy and at the bar. We didn't drink anything fancy, or sample any food, we kept hanging out because of Dani; it's as simple as that. This is an excellent example of what great customer service will do for a business. Side note, the tab wasn't crazy either, we barely broke $40, and we bought a birthday shot for a lady celebrating her 50th birthday? 50 or not, she took it like a boss.   Would I come here again and try the food? Maybe for brunch, I mean... a Philly Cheese-Steak Frittata sounds ridic.   Dani, I see you. Keep it up!",

Chicken was horrible like it was boiled and the cheese was like squeezed out of a can, on top of that the guacamole which was runny n brown, I had to ask what that was. How can a cook or server actually serve this. We had 2 other appetizers can't even remember what it was bc I was totally disgusted. Drinks were meh as well. Totally not worth eating here, even if it's out of convenience.",

Ordered a couple happy hour drinks and snacks.... they were out of potstickers... my favorite.  It took 40 minutes for my apps to get here.... maybe they were all busy in the kitchen making more potsticker... very disappointed...  Update: 3/7/18: came in today looking for my very favorite items: potstickers, Mac and cheese and  their Macau noodle soup. They changed the potstickers to \"homemade\" not a good change... maybe food cost was an issue...? They came out grossly over cooked... I.e. crisp.... never had crisp on potstickers... not good. Well ok, I can look forward to my worlds favorite Mac and cheese... was told that yesterday they changed from Elbow pasta to penne which ruined the dish texture and taste....I always have one to go..  I am canceling the to go one...... and oh by the way... it was cold when it came out. The soup was still good. The place just lost my bookmark and return business..  bummer, bummer.. was literally one of my favorites in Vegas.  One very positive thing, they took off the potstickers and the Mac & Cheese from the bill. One thing i MUST add... the server (bartender) was superb through this... it can usually get pretty sticky through something like this, but she was phenomenal!!",

He did fix it very nicely which was a surprise. Over priced and bad experience, I will not be returning.",

    "text": "Came here for late night happy hour which goes from 9pm to closing.  Environment: I sat at the round circle bar. There were a lot of small groups just socializing and have a good casual time. They also had their main restaurant that wasn't too busy.  Service: they only had one waitress and bartender for the bar area at night. Because there were a number of groups, she seemed to be pretty busy and had a hard time catching up with people's needs. Nonetheless, she never forgot anything we ordered which I was impressed by.  Food: the food here is usually pretty delicious. I only had the artichoke dip with the bruschetta and it was very good. The bread was lightly toasty in butter and it came with a creamy dip and side of pico de gallo. I also got the jack sparrow old fashion which was very good and sweet.   Overall, their happy hour deal is amazing. Everything is pretty cheap and everything taste really good. Just expect to wait a bit to get your drinks and food since they are a bit understaffed at night, but as long as you are with friends and are entertained, this is a pretty fun spot to meet up after work.",

My husband and I went to the Elephant Bar for dinner, but to our surprise, the wait staff thought they worked in a day care instead of a restaurant as they were laughing and joking and horse playing with each other. Apparently having a good time was more important than doing their actual job. We sat at our table for at least 15 minutes with absolutely no acknowledgement. They weren't even that busy, so I hope they enjoyed being even less busy as we left.",

It's actually pretty easy to find in the Village Walk at The District at Green Valley Ranch. Just park near all the real estate offices and start walking towards the Green Valley Ranch Casino and just before you approach the casino it will be on your right.  (+) Decor was very unique and very cool! Lots of little details to the place, which is much bigger inside than it appeared from the outside. (+) Restaurant was very clean and organized. (+) Sangria was very tasty and enjoyable! (+) Chicken Tortilla soup was very tasty, with a little kick to it! Salad was okay and portion size was pleasing.  (-) Service was hit and miss. The young lady who served us was very busy and missed bringing several items to our table, including a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Then it took for-ev-er to get our desert and then our bill later. She was very nice though. Like I said, maybe she felt a bit overwhelmed. (-) teriyaki chicken rice was so-so at best. Tasted way too salty. Makes me wonder if they use MSG.  I do also like the fact that they post the calorie count of all of their menu items. Makes it much easier to track, if you're into that sort of thing.  I don't know. I just wasn't too impressed with this place to justify a return visit. The service was so-so and the food, while not terrible, wasn't good enough to impress me.  2 stars.  Meh. I've experienced better.",

    "text": "A let down of bad food with great menu descriptions. The happy hour here is a great deal and their cocktails, especially Mai Tai, are delicious.   Food, however, is overcooked and badly seasoned. Potato skins are cut into spears and this caused the skins to be crusty and hard to the point of stale-like quality. Only the middles of the spears were edible. The  melted cheese mixture was too mild and lacked flavor. They came with ranch, not sour cream?They were OK for $3 off. The coconut shrimp skewers, unfortunately, were disgusting. Very small, burnt, and no flavor. Not to mention they are one shrimp per skewer and this means 4 small shrimp total. Very upsetting. They are rested atop a pool of sweet-n-sour sauce and wonton strips??The sauce didn't accompany the shrimp at all and with burnt coconut, even less appealing.   The entrees were also disappointing. Misoyaki salmon was not tasty or appealing to the eye. For a full-flavored fish like salmon, this had a VERY pale pink color and tasted more like chicken. The glaze was not reminiscent of miso at all and clearly put on the fish too early in the cooking process such that it developed a burnt taste by the time the fish was finished grilling. Not palatable. The vegetables underneath the fish filet were cut too thin and thus became soggy. Soggy squash is disgusting, especially unseasoned, soggy squash. The mashed potatoes, instead of rice, were supposed to be garlic mashed but the garlic was nonexistent. The potatoes also were not homemade and if they were, water was added to them instead of milk. Had a baby food quality. Again, no salt or pepper.   The stir fry is a poor attempt at one and the Cobb salad came with bacon jam spread on toast instead of croutons?? Take a guess about the bacon jam....inedible.   Dessert to go was the gooey butter cake. This was not a butter cake but rather a yellow cake, possibly boxed, with a teaspoon of toffee sauce drizzled on top and RAW? pear slices. The toffee sauce was a \"bourbon\" toffee sauce. No bourbon detected at all. Shocking.   Needless to say, it's not worth coming here unless it's for happy hour and you want to wash down average appetizers with a strong drink. Probably not a return spot.....",

    "text": "I came here for lunch after strolling and looking in shops while a family member was in town. We both wanted salads and soup and ordered side Cesar salads which were huge and added chicken for another few bucks. I ended up bringing half home and also half of my soup. I ordered the shrimp noodle soup without salmon. If was good but could've used a little bit more of a lime flavor to it in my opinion. Was sweet as some reviewers have stated. I wanted to order dessert to go on the way out and forgot and the bartender (only server working at this point) the restaurant was completely dead this whole time (3-4) she told me she can't help me and walked away very rudely and with an attitude. I didn't get her name but she's older. Short, dark hair with some red in it. Our server Trina was awesome and Lucy is also awesome and hooked us up with dessert so I recommend either of them for good service.",

My boyfriend and I came about 2 months ago and struck up a conversation with Maria while she made our drinks. Not only were the drinks phenomenal but we left feeling like we had just talked to a friend. We same back tonight to celebrate our engagement and she remembered us from the previous encounter and noticed the ring that had not been there last time- something even my coworkers had not noticed. Any bar can make tasty drinks, but it takes somewhere special to make an experience. Thank you Maria and Lisa for making our experience!",

    "text": "Lest some readers of this review think that I've suddenly lost my touch or perspective, I can only say in my defense that I have seen the woefully low overall Yelp rating for this establishment and read many of the low-rated reviews, but must nevertheless ignore them and honestly report on my recent trip to the Elephant Bar.   I don't know whether I had an atypical dining experience, or if Elephant Bar staff took heed to recited complaints and improved their food and service, or if other reviewers just encountered a bad day there, but my overall experience was enjoyable, and all dishes I sampled were tasty.    I began with very good Macau Shrimp Noodle Soup, sporting mushrooms, green onions, white onions, bok choy, and fairly large shrimp in a lightly spicy broth.  It was an unusual and interesting Asian-flavored dish.    For my entree, I selected Chicken Marsala, which included a nicely grilled chicken breast, pappardelle noodles, and a mild traditional Marsala Sauce, accompanied by a good cooked tomato half and sauteed spinach.  It was a filling and satisfying display.  For dessert, what turned out to be a very big order of Strawberry Shortcake tasted good but I could have done without the thin Strawberry Sauce.  I also tried a friend's Creme Brulee, and it was very good.  Service was friendly and on the whole very efficient.  Food and drink orders were correctly fulfilled.  But entrees arrived a little early after appetizers and soup.  And, on the initial bill the server had forgotten to credit Senior Explorer card discounts.  This oversight was quickly corrected.    Judging by this one personal encounter with the Elephant Bar situated in Henderson, and several previous good dining outcomes I have experienced at Elephant Bar restaurants throughout Southern California, I expect to return here fairly soon for other fare, like the tantalizing Chicken Lettuce Wraps with glistening moist bits of chicken, diced water chestnuts, unblemished green shells of lettuce, and peanut sauce that one of my tablemates simply was not willing to share.  Boo!  Hiss!",

    "text": "I've never written a Yelp review before, but after my experience at Elephant Bar today I felt that I had to do so.  My good friend and I, at my recommendation, dined at the restaurant today. There were only a few customers, midday on a Sunday, so we obviously anticipated fast, great service and food. Our waitress was very nice, I think her name is Ginger, so for customer service I give her 5 stars.  However, when it comes to the food, I don't know what happened!  I haven't dined here in almost 3 years, but when I did it use to be the go to spot for me and my former co-workers, which is why I selected it for today's outing, anticipating that the food quality and customer service would be close to if not above and beyond what I had previously experienced.  So whereas the customer service is still excellent, the food quality has suffered.  I had the calamari appetizer and it was pretty good.  However, my friend, a local very successful business owner, ordered the most expensive steak and he absolutely hated it.  He said that it tasted like it had been fried!  I don't know what happened.  Did the cook dip it in the fryer to \"warm it up\" because it was cold due to sitting too long on the line?  As I mentioned earlier the restaurant wasn't busy.  There were less than 30 customers in the restaurant, but it took almost 25 minutes from order to delivery before my guest received his meal.  I don't know what happened, but I was embarrassed to have invited him to Elephant Bar, both as his friend and co-op business owner.   I meet with and entertain clients and business associates often, and whereas I previously thought the Elephant Bar could be, once again, one of my \"go-to\" places in Henderson, today's experience has unfortunately shown me that this is not the case.  So sad... because I truly think the wait and hostess staff are excellent, but I don't know what's happened in the kitchen.  As a former co-restaurant owner/self-proclaimed \"foodie\" and ex-wife of a CIA (Culinary Institute of America) grad, good food I definitely know. Today I didn't experience that from a restaurant that I previously loved to visit.  To the management, consistency, especially in the kitchen, is the key to success or failure of a restaurant.  With the competition in this town, that is more important than ever!  Today your establishment did not live up to your previous food quality standards.  I'm hopeful that this is something that you can correct in the future.",

I sat outside which their seating outside provides a great view, spacious tables, and temperature control. All which make eating outside very pleasurable.   Their menu provides a great selection and pricing is average. I was on an all vegan diet, which was not a big problem for their chef to work with. I ordered soba noodles with vegetable stir fry and tofu. 100% vegan. Most people think of vegan as a flavorless meal, this entree was the complete opposite. It was flavorable enough that for those that are non-vegan, I recommend to try.   Overall if you are strolling around The District I recommend you to stop by. If the weather is nice, try eating outside. Have specific needs? The employees (especially our host Brandon) was understanding and went out of his way to make my experience pleasurable.",

But while asking where we should celebrate our birthdays, she said she'd give it another try. My first impression was that it reminded me of the Rainforest Cafe which held a special place in my heart due to some very fond memories but the menu was far more diverse than anything at that iconic location. I had the Philly Cheese Steak with Caesar salad and it was to die for! The French roll was cooked to perfection and the balance of meat, cheese, and peppers was superb. Trina, our waitress, was amazing. It wouldn't have been quite the same experience without her dazzling personality and impeccable service.

Needs a bit more BBQ sauce. Not finger-licking enough. The meal also came with peach cobbler, fries, and cole slaw.  - There was a mix of potato and sweet potato fries. Not fresh, but not old. Could be better.  - Shrimp and rice was good. Reminded me of Pei Wei. Rice a bit harder than normal. Needs more water or change it to 3 ladies. haha.  - Portion was enough for the dine.

    "text": "Why did The Cheesecake Factory change their name? Because this is just a really poor imitation of it.   It was really busy when I met a friend there one evening for drinks, but managed to snag a couple of seats at the bar. I barely saw the rest of the restaurant and only going to and from the bathroom (where I almost killed myself on their weird flooring leading to it - watch out in heels). It really did just seem like an old take on TCF or some other chain that you really don't want to spend an evening drinking in.  The service is dismal. I know I'm at a bar and that I expect to be served drinks. How dare I! If your thing is being ignored right in front of the bartender's face then you will dig this joint.   We practically begged to get served. It was really not nice. Not only am I in a crowded bar without enough room to move, but I'm also not getting drinks to soothe my frazzled nerves OR getting a menu OR water. I suppose I'm there to serve as a warning to other people who might think this is a good idea.  We ordered food which was so forgettable I've forgotten what it was. Not to beat a dead horse, but think TCF without the taste.   Had I been the one paying I would have expressed my unhappiness in the form of a 10% tip (and that would have been a seriously good tip since, you know, I was trying To Insure Prompt Service and failed), but the guy I was with was nicer than I was. Well, I have an idea, so I don't have to worry about that again I just won't go back.",

Then I had the Pacific Cove salad, which was a little too fishy and I am not sure I liked how each item was segregated on the plate. The crab and shrimp seemed like they were just pulled from the freezer. Everything was just okay. For the money it wasn't worth it.   The atmosphere was nothing special either... just another regular chain-like setting.",

My reason for a lower rating is because I have come here many times and always love it but they have completely changed the menu and every favorite thing I loved is gone. I'm so Disappointed with the new menu. Not sure if I will return.",

    "text": "Wanted to give them 5 stars because I have been a loyal elephant bar customer for over 10 years. I always ate at the location in Burlingame, CA and expected the same customer service and quality in Vegas. Unfortunately, I didn't. I called and made reservations for 10:30pm on a Thursday go celebrate our anniversary, as this restaurant was my favorite place growing up. Sadly we showed up at 10:30 and the whole dining floor was vacant except the bar area and we waited over 5 minutes to be greeted. The host was gone and I believe the bartender had to come up and tell us they were closed. I firmly expressed my disappointment and was upset that I had even made reservations by phone for our anniversary night, and besides the fact that the restaurant closed at 11:00 not 10:30. I told them we had a reso and they seated us. We had such slow service as the lady was taking care of people at the bar and us and we waited over 10 minutes for water. I work in a restaurant too and mentioned that this was unacceptable. We began to receive better service from the manager himself and were constantly then being checked on up which was appreciated. The night started out bad and I had higher expectations, but it ended well and the food was exceptional like always. I just hope next time I visit we will have a better time with the service.",

    "text": "Yelp censored the below review of Elephant bar  \"Really horrible.....  Probably the worst food I have ever eaten.   Really nothing else to say\"  As it violated their content guidelines  So I will add to it.  The food at elephant bar was substandard to the point of being inedible.   I ate 2 bites of my Cajon chicken...and just stopped eating. My kid can make microwave chicken better then that.   The rice with andoulle sausage that was the side dish was actually worse. It had either sat out for days....because the rice was crispy despite not being fried, or was microwaved beyond recognition as rice.  This place should be ashamed of serving food like this",

At first we were weary because of some of the reviews, but everything was perfect from start to finish and our server Joe was running circles around the restaurant. He had our drinks filled constantly and gave great service. I got the sirloin steak (so tender+juicy) and my boyfriend got the ribeye steak. We loved everything, and we're kind of shocked- I can honestly say it's one of the best steaks I've had at a spot like this one. Potato skins were good too!",

It wasn't - immediate seating and we sat there till almost closing with lots of empty tables around us - I get the feeling they aren't doing well.  I ordered 2 drinks and didn't care for either.  The strawberry mule had chunks of fruit in it which I don't like.  Nothing worse than sucking chunks through your straw and gagging at every sip.  The martini was straight booze, and not in a good way.  I added ice and water till the very end and the drink never got better.     My friend liked her tacos and her moscato.  I liked my chicken marsala.  All in all it wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either.  Not a place I would choose to come regularly, just went cause it was convenient.",

Dinner: She had the grilled steak and I had the thai style tilapia.  Talk about flavor with every bite!
