It's busy on the weekend but they run through the list quick, get you seated and take your order than bam! here comes your food!  It's a huge menu so whatever you and your fellow diners are in the mood for you can all get it.  My honey had the WAITRESS SPECIAL and I ordered the MEAT LOVER SKILLET.  The waffles are sweet cream and so is the soft whipped butter - yummay! My skillet came with a side of salsa, which I loved.  There are a few locations in town, but none on the west side :(  It had been probably 20 years since my last visit but I won't be waiting that long next time!",

One got short stack pancakes, one got the Full House Breakfast with blueberry crepes and I got the Wild West Omelette without ham. When they say lots of cheddar cheese, they aren't lying. Only thing is that the potatoes (home style potatoes) weren't quite done enough for my liking, but I like mine more on the softer side. Everyone else thought they were fine. You definitely get a lot for your money and the food is great. Coffee is really good too. Not too strong and not too weak. Cups are very large. We all agreed that we would come back again.",

My favorite is the cinnamon one.   I now have them use the granola pancake and add the cinnamon mixture to it.   Talk about crazy good.  Eggs/Omelets/Egg Sanwiches are very good. Potato pancakes are very good. The porkchops were okay, but not my favorite. Sandwiches are good. Salads are pretty good per my husband.  No one complains when we come here.  Artwork is cute an quirky.  Look for the little hidden funny items on the etched glass.  **Regarding LOGO - Blueberry sauce in the picture should really be blue even if it is not accurate.  Everyone I bring does mention the image and says not good since it looks like something else.",

Had the eggs Benedict with the potato pancakes added to the Benedict in between the muffin and the ham. Side of fruits. Sounds amazing but what I got was not amazing.   The potato pancake was raw and gross, very squishy and white. The ham was really thick, and not what I expected. Some people like tons of ham, I don't ,this was like a hockey puck. Unfortunately I had to send it back. I NEVER send food back. I felt really bad, but I just couldn't eat it. The server was very nice, and didn't mind, because she was so cool thats why I give 3 stars.  Instead I got some poached egg with fruit and an english muffin. Turned out fine, just won't order the potato pancakes again.",

Service was prompt but not overbearing. We had plenty of time to look at the huge menu and the waitress was kind when I asked a few questions about the specials I had sped past on the way to my seat.  Waffles definitely taste like an old school diner. Were all diners issued the same waffle makers way back in the day??Anyways... waffle was huge. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Bacon was cooked perfectly - crispy but not burned. My wifey had the omelet and it was INSANELY huge. I think it was 4 eggs. Whoa. Huge.   I'd dine here again in a heartbeat. Portions were huge and the price was super cheap.",

Ordered a sirloin, medium, specifically asked for mushrooms and bacon. Was offered that the mushrooms be sauteed, chose it. Steak came out undercooked, the mushrooms looked and tasted like they came straight out of the can and maybe only warmed by the steak, and in a clump on the side. No bacon to be seen anywhere, except in it's place, next to the clump of mushrooms, was a clump of onions. A little irked by this, I immediately asked for a side of bacon, stating I'd pay for it, whatever, but stated I never said anything about onions.   Bacon came out, small mostly fatty awful looking garbage. The coffee I ordered also tasted terrible, was luke warm, etc.  I don't blame the servers, they were fine. Cook was pure shit.   Mind you, I grew up in the crappier parts of cities, so I can appreciate a bad diner, but this was like... I don't even know. I wouldn't feed it to dogs, and if I didn't feel bad for the servers, I'd have dine and dashed, leaving only a tip. Used to be good, I dunno what happened, but whoever the cook is should lose his/her job.",

I think this is the first BH with a small bar area.   If you're looking for a real \"old school\" breakfast, this is the place. Best pancakes in town plus a wide variety of bacon, eggs, sausage, hash browns and the well-known blueberry muffins (I usually get a couple to go).  They have plenty of good lunch and dinner items, too. Turkey dinner is a favorite and burgers, too. I'd probably go here more often if they had Salmon, Prime Rib or maybe even a Ribeye steak but that's just me. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of items to choose from.  The desserts, especially the chocolate cake, are delicious. They have several specials every day, too.  Plus they have good parking despite being on one of Las Vegas's busiest streets - Flamingo. I still like the BH on Decatur, too.",

Now I am a creature of habit, so whenever I went I would get the blueberry pancakes with blueberry compote.  But then I discovered crepes... oh... my....gravy... the crepes... they are evil good... they pull you in and they want you to have them daily. They are super thin , and filled with a cream cheese filling ... and have compote on the top... ohhh yeah sign me up...  Then even better than that are the Rum Runner Pancakes .. they are coconut/pineapple captain morgan goodness that should be your go to for a carb overload... and comfort food friend. Delish!

First of all the bus boy brought us water and FRESH hot coffee before we even sat all the way down. We decided to share food because it was a little more pricey than we had planned on spending, so i ordered a small fruit cup on the side also.   There was SO MUCH FOOD!! between the two of us sharing we could not even finish it! and our coffee never got below half a cup. The wait staff was ON IT! our service was great. Food was typical diner food but tasty as well. My husband ordered chicken fried steak and eggs, and I dont eat meat so he had them substitute egg whites for me and I STILL could not finish my portion!   If you are really hungry this is the place for you! We went on a Sunday morning about 730a.m. and it wasnt crowded at all. but they didnt have any specials either. the specials are only during the week. so over all we spent about 20 bucks, but there was a TON of food we left full and happy and the coffee was bomb!",

Fast Forward 15 YEARS...Apparently It Left An Impression....  In Vegas With My Co-Workers For A Paul Mitchell Convention....and I Was In Charge Of The Agenda Which Was To Include Meals...So We Didn't Argue....So Of Course My First Thought Was That We Were Going To Come Here For Breakfast One Day.  I Had Talked It Up To My Team...and Let Me Say, When We First Got There...They Were Like WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU TAKING US??!!  It Is A Little In The Ghetto....And The Restaurant Looks Like It Could Use Some Renovation Love....But They Love and Trust Me...So We Went It....LUCKILY...It Was BUSY...But Not Out The Door Busy (Like It Can Get)....We Sat Down Had The Most AMAZING and SPUNKY Waitress....Browsed The Menu (I Know What I Was Having Biscuits and Gravy).  Everyone Ordered, Still A Little Skeptical, It Is Just Your Standard Breakfast Joint Menu....UNTILL THE FOOD CAME....Then No One Spoke...Just Ate.  Ate Their Food...Ate Off Each Others Plates....Wanted More...But Were Too Full To Think About More Food.  I Had Redeemed Myself In The Eyes Of My Co-Workers With The Best Breakfast In Vegas......We Still Talk About The Pancakes....Biscuit and Gravy and The OMLETTA....  Mind you...we know the meal clogged our arteries just a little....but we made up for it, with some well deserved shopping cardio right afterwards....We can't wait for next years training....!!    Oh and PS:  When We Left....It Was Out The Door Line....and That's Always A Good Sign!!!",

The menu is big so it took me awhile to make a good choice. I went with the potato pancake combo. It was good, solid... nothing exceptional. Came with both sour cream and applesauce, which I liked. Hate having to pick one. Overall a decent, expedient, reasonable meal. Good standby.",

This last time I went it was just Kim and I. I changed my order last minute as the waitress showed up and went for the \"OMLLECAKE\". There is a pic of it that someone posted on here already. I could not finish the beast, but what a delicious challenge. A four egg omlette with whatever trimmings you want wrapped in a giant pancake. MMM good, and I am usually a savory not sweet breakfast person. I may never attempt the Omllecake again, but that is only because they have a huge menu and I am eager to try it all. Also, I can only speak for this location, I have passed by the others, but only eaten at this one.",

I've been to other Blueberry Hills, but this is my first time in this location. It was 5:30 on a Wednesday.   Facility:  Just like the other BHs, it is a typical American diner decor and feel. There are all booths for seating. It was a clean spot with very few patrons. They play 50s kinda music quietly overhead.   Service:  We were told to seat ourselves. The waitress was nice enough, but seemed to be the only one working, so pretty busy.   Food:  I ordered the pork chop dinner with country gravy on the side.  The pork chops 3.5/5 were cooked pretty good. Just a tad on the dry side, but not enough to ruin the food.  Mashed potatoes were homemade, and yummy!!! 5/5 Country gravy was good too. 4/5 Green beans were green beans 3/5, but they did have a little flavor to them to make them more savory.   Overall:  I liked this spot. The food was good. Grandpa was happy, and it was a nice and close to him. We will DEFINITELY be back. :)",

Yes ever. Sweet and super fluffy smother in butter and syrup and you're in pancake heaven. I got the meat sampler on a Saturday morning it was on special for $9.99 and there was plenty of food to take home. It came with two huge pancakes, eggs, hash browns, bacon, ham and sausage. Meat lovers will be In heaven. Or perfect if you're like me and can never decide on something to order. It Comes with everything. The boyfriend got the coconut chicken and waffle. Crispy chicken and waffle. Perfect combo if you love sweet and savory. They also have lunch and dinner and a huge menu so something for everyone.",

I had the meat skillet and it was delicious. The potatoes were seasoned just right and the cheese was perfectly melted and the eggs cooked just how I like them. I tried the waffles...so crisp and fluffy...I tried the blueberry muffin and it was so soft and just melted in my mouth.  On my second visit I tired the omelet with home potatoes and sourdough toast...and I tried my friends pancakes. The bread, the eggs and the pancakes were all so fluffy and wonderful. I just can't say enough about how good this place is.   The service is always excellent too. I will be back during my summer vacation in July. And I'm going to try even more menu items.",

    "text": "I had been here before, about eight years ago.  I went with my sister who couldn't really afford to go anywhere \"fancy.\"  We went and had a nice early dinner, at a reasonable price.  Fast forward eight years.  I'm working, making better money (still cheap, though!) and with my boyfriend, who loves, loves, loves waffles.  He was going to settle for Denny's, when I remembered Blueberry Hill.  We drove up and he was super skeptical about the place.  It isn't the most interesting looking diner around.  But, it is big and clean.  The place was bustling, but I think that it was a bunch of locals having a leisurely Sunday breakfast.    Jeff ordered a waffle combo with 2 poached eggs and 2 pieces of bacon.  Not having had enough fruit and/or fiber, he also ordered a side of fruit.  He devoured the waffle!  The eggs he wanted a little better cooked than they were, but he still ate them and didn't feel the need to send them back.  The bacon he took his time on eating.  The fruit also went slowly.  I had a few pieces of cantaloupe from it and I thought it was sweet, despite not being completely ripened yet.  I got a breakfast burrito. I didn't realize that it was smothered.  Had I known, I might have asked for them not to smother it.  It was a weird sauce, not quite enchilada sauce, not Spanish sauce, not marinara, not salsa, yet it had elements of all of them.  Very strange.  It added nothing to the dish.  The insides were scrambled eggs, peppers and oninons. I love onions, so I wouldn't complain about that, but others might think there were more onions than eggs.  I asked them to leave off the rice. They did and I just had salad, some sour cream and the refried beans with the burrito.  The beans were fine, probably canned, but they were hot and not too salty.  I was just ok with what i got.  I probably should have just gotten an omelet.  The cashier was painfully slow.  There was a line of about 7 people. We could have easily left without paying.  Jeff was honest, however.   They have a few video slots machines right when you walk in, but I never saw anyone play them.  The windows in that entryway also have a southwest theme etched into them, but the logo of the place is a boy pouring out blueberry jam?  It was a non sequitir for me, but since I didn't go there for the ambience, I can't really criticize it.",

After about 10 minutes a nice waitress in a different section comes over to us and asks us if we have been helped. Our waitress comes to the table, I'm unsure of her name and it really doesn't matter. She acts put out as we place our drink order and rudely interjects that they don't have the drinks we originally wanted. We settle on drinks and place our food order. At the end of taking everything down, she asks me if I know they close at 9pm, mind you it is 8:23pm. After all of this I'm pretty hot, the worst part of this is that I would have given this place a million stars years ago when I lived here. The trip back to this specific location was supposed to be nostalgic. This is a great example of how a bad employee can ruin a business. Based on this experience, I cannot in good faith, give this anymore than 1 star. I weigh heavily on customer service, I'm sure the food would have been great, but I didn't get that far.",

They had a crunchy cinnamon crust on top and were soft and tender inside.  Seriously, the most delicious pancakes I have ever had.  I got 4 huge pancakes and could only eat 1 1/2 so had some yummy left overs although the cinnamon crust softened.  My hubby loved them, too.  His potato pancakes were flavorful so overall we were two happy campers.  Always, BBH is a must when in Vegas!",

My favorite omelette is no longer available, that was the Philly Cheese Steak Omelette. Oh and yes the prices on most items have also gone up. Just a plain Waffle is now $8.99!!! Really??

    "text": "There is an ancient Chinese saying that goes \"If eating at a restaurant with Burrito in the name, its not usually a good idea to get a Hamburger.\"  That maxim holds True here at Blueberry Hill.  Basically, if you get anything that contains blueberries I have no doubt you're going to enjoy it.  The Blueberry pancakes are excellent as is the waffle and crepe.  In fact, Im sure if you do any of those with any fruit they're tasty.  Where the situation goes downhill is on the rest of the menu.    The eggs were a pretty sorry mess.  They looked as if they were left over from a buffet hot tray.  The hash browns were an amalgamation of frozen potato strips heated up to \"meh.\"  I recently got the Chili Cheese Omelet which had some fancy name like Texas Omelet and the chili was so plain I was actually scooping around it to get back to the eggs which says a lot (see above).  If I had only listened to those darn Chinese philosophers.  They appear to have a lunch and dinner menu, but to be honest thats like saying JC Penny's sells electronics.  Sure its there, but does anyone really opt for it?  The crazy thing is how crowded this place can get.  I mean, if everyone were there to get Blueberry pancakes, I could understand but I know there not....which means Im either missing something or Vegas has a dearth of solid breakfast options.    So to recap: Go if you need pancakes or waffles, especially with blueberries.  Avoid most everything else.  Three stars because they nail what their name says they should and their staff is quite friendly.    PS- Coffee is just decent.",

    "text": "I would give this place zero stars if I could. To begin with, service sucked. The waitress that took our order looked like she hated working here and was not even wearing a name tag. During our meal, we had to call her over 3 times because she did not bother to offer us any sauces or syrup (since my friend ordered the french toast).  The food was mediocre. I ordered the chicken strips dinner with fries and coleslaw and I have to say, the chicken strips from Dennys are 10x better. The coleslaw tasted old, the chicken strips were dry, and the fries were just okay. Since I did not enjoy my food, I sent it back and the waitress just said \"oh,\" left the check in our table, and left. We were waiting for her to come back for about 10 min to talk about the meal, but she never came back. We had to literally get up and look for her. We asked to talk to the manager because we wanted the meal taken off the check, but we were told that the manager was not there. We told the waitress we were not going to pay for a meal I had not ate and that we wanted it off the check. She hesitated and gave us a dirty look, but ended up taking the meal off the check.  Never coming back to this place again.",

    "text": "3.5 stars  This is where big ass families or hungover twenty-somethings go on Sunday mornings to binge on pancakes and syrup; I was part of the latter. Perhaps the alcohol clouded my judgement but it wasn't too bad. The portions are generous and prices are reasonable. They focus on classic American food with some south of the border influence. Chorizo Omelette and Chilaqueles Verde, anyone? There are no frills, glitter, and gimmicks here. Just straight forward food.  I enjoyed my veggie omelette and pancakes. It tasted fresh and not too greasy. My friend gave her stamp of approval on the Huevos Rancheros. Although, they were late on giving my friend's potatoes. Ambiance recalls old Vegas diner: fading lights, plastic seats, and outdated decor. This places screams nostalgia. The waitress was totally cool and seemed unfazed by the stampede of customers. Overall, Blueberry succeeds on delivering decent breakfast food.",

First of all, the food: Great pot roast. Tender and tasty, the sides were good as well.  Now, the service:  Promptly greeted and seated. Order was taken quickly. And then it deteriorated rapidly. Was brought the salad, the food arrived before I had time to finish it, that's kind of normal. I had ordered coffee for a drink. My waitress never checked on me during the course of the meal. She sat at the counter and ate. I understand that employees need to eat, but in my restaurant experience, you make sure another waitress covers your tables. I had to wave down the other waitress to get more coffee. The special included dessert. My waitress brought my check, I had to make a point of desiring dessert, she made no mention of it. She cleared my table, taking my silverware, then brought the pie I ordered (very good apple pie by the way). She didn't bring a fork with it. So I'm now sitting with apple pie in front of me with no means to eat it. It took a few minutes to locate my waitress and get her to bring me a fork, which she did in what almost seemed a begrudging manner.  I've been here more than a few times to eat, and to be fair have experienced excellent service in the past. This experience was definitely out of the norm for this restaurant.  As I enjoy eating here, I hope it's not a trend.",

Good Comfort food for a Native New Yorker.   Hubby had a Bacon Cheeseburger with hashbrowns .  He loved it and couldn't finish the hash browns, we had a nice to-go box at the end of the meal.   Price wasn't too bad.. noticed the Breakfast items were more money than the dinner items.  I guess because it's known for Brekkie..   I am happy we found Blueberry Hill.. it's clean, and homey.

    "text": "Blueberry Hill is a great local diner. Prices are modest, but portions are huge. The omelettes are made with FOUR eggs! They're huge. Granted, they aren't the prettiest things, but they are packed with filling. Plus, they are open 24 hours.  Even in Vegas, finding a decent, convenient 24 hour place can be somewhat tricky.    The coffee is pretty weak, but what do expect from a diner?  We tried two of the omelettes. The corned beef hash omelette was packed with hash, cheddar cheese, onions, and pepper. The eggs were surprisingly fluffy, though they wouldn't win a beauty contest.  The apple chicken sausage omelette was also good, though I found the sausage was a bit meek in flavor. All omelettes are served with a choice of pancakes (which are huge), french toast, or hash browns and toast.  The place was packed to the rafters, but service was decent. The kitchen was slow, but out waitress was great.  She was one of those older diner waitresses whom you'd expect would put her hand on your shoulder and call you honey as she refilled your coffee. Much to my disappointment, she didn't, but she kept our water glasses and coffee mugs full.  Definitely will be back the next time I am in Vegas. I had to give this place two $$ signs, but it would be on the very low end of that range. I would estimate about $11-14 per person, including your meal and a soft drink or cup o' joe.",

I might have liked the meal better if I had gotten the chicken and waffles. This was just too much like Sysco food.

    "text": "Another Dice adventure from about 2 weeks ago.    Been busy and havent updated on time.     The Pros:   Clean.  Comfortable Fast service Huge menu with a lot of choices Cheap  The cons:  The worst chili I have ever eaten, I think chili is one thing everyone should order and to me that tells you right there if the restaurant is good or not, haha, I have had some bad chili but this was by far the worst.  My friend said his burger was OK but dry...My friend had biscuits and Gravy and she said it was different.     All in all, I wouldnt choose it again, well I didnt, our friend did but she wouldnt choose it again either  ;)  Maybe for breakfast?  Different cook may make that experience totally different and maybe a different Blueberry Hill.",

The server was nice but mostly invisible and,when I found a hair in my food, I could not find anyone to help me. Once,I showed the short black hair, (mine is long and brown and was pulled back with a hat), the management could have cared less.    In addition, there were dirty flies landing on us and the table but still no reaction, so I will never return.    I paid $12.60 for dried out crusted chicken and alfredo pasta with absolutely no flavor, it was like chewing my tongue. Casinos in Vegas have 2 for 1 sometimes as low as $9.99, so this place is out of line with their attitude and food.  This restaurant is two blocks from the Las Vegas strip and my entertainment was watching all shapes, sizes and colors of homeless people mill around this restaurant...a very sad show outside your windows.",

We were a party of 5 and the waitress was very attentive and kept our coffee cups full. Good prices and big portions too!   My friend ordered the fruit filled crepe which had some special 4 cheese mix stuffed in it and she loved it. She even ordered some to go. You get 3 crepes for around $12.   I ordered the fruit and cheese French toast but wasn't blown away by it. They had a sugar glaze on top which was too sweet so I ended up scraping it off. They did give a good amount of cheese filling and berries but I still felt the dish was on the sweeter side, even after scraping off the glazed top.   Another friend ordered an omelette which came with 3 big pancakes... She did not finish everything. If you're craving pancakes and want some protein, you should order their omelette combo. It's enough to share, and the second person can order something else like crepes. A lot of the pancakes sounded delicious, and my gf told me that they make their own batter. I wasn't able to try it but i will next time!",

There are 7 Blueberry Hills listed on Yelp. This one is about 3 blocks from my sister's house, which is why I always end up there for at least one meal. Preferably breakfast. They do a killer blueberry pancake (as you might guess), and have a variety of gut busting specialties. (Their omelletes made with four eggs.) I was disappointed in the Monte Cristo sandwich, which is a test for me. Clean, friendly service, inexpensive -- everything you expect from a pancake house. They have a bin by the front door to collect food and clothing for the homeless, which is a nice touch. Also a couple of video poker machines, which is standard for Vegas.",

    "text": "What a shame. This place was supposed to be my substitute for the Anchor Grill in Covington, KY. I have been having some serious good ol' fashioned greasy spoon withdrawl since I moved to Vegas, over two years ago. So, Blueberry Hill it is, but only when I absolutely HAVE to.  The seating's not comfortable, but that's to be expected of a diner. The service is less than desireable, but that's expected as well. The food ... eh. I ordered a plate of ham 'n eggs, home fries, and wheat toast. I received a plate of, certainly, ham 'n eggs, but of the variety with the grill still stuck to them. The potatoes were dark and dry, and the toast resembled a kitchen sponge left to dry on the counter for a couple weeks. Had this been served to me after a long night at Zodie's, then I probably wouldn't have known the difference. Or cared. I would have dove in, face first, heartily and happily. But no one likes to start the day with a bad taste in their mouth and indigestion. It certainly wasn't worth nearly six of MY dollars. Next time, I'll stick to their pancakes. Or a waffle. How hard is it to ruin one of those?  There is something silly and wacky about Blueberry Hill that should be mentioned. They have a bell that sounds every so often, and when it does, the entire staff stops what their doing to wash their hands.  I forgot to mention the gamblin' machines in the front lobby. Ah, Vegas -- omlettes, hashbrowns, and video poker, oh my!",

Corned Beef Hash: I'm always surprised at how different each diner will prepare the corned beef hash. This version offered tender diced onions along with crispy and salty corned beef. It was really good. Some places make their hash really mushy, but Blueberry Hill cooks it to the right consistency in my book. Crispy, but still moist.  Eggs: Surprisingly better than most places. The eggs had a silky smooth texture to it. I'm guessing they used a dash of cream in it.  Hash Browns: Best hash browns i've had at a diner. It was your typical shredded potatoes, however the hash browns were cooked to crisp perfection.",

I'm not even a pancake fan, but after watching plate after plate go by during each visit, I finally ordered some blueberry ones.  Light, fluffy, the tiniest bit of crisp griddle edge.  Buttery.  Delicious!    Their blueberry muffins are very good, also made from scratch.  Our server recommended we order it split and grilled, where they cut it in half, butter the sides, and grill it until warm.  Much better than microwaved and calorie free!

    "text": "I had the BEST breakfast at this place. The portions are huge so you might want to share with someone.  Hubby got their famous blueberry pancakes while I got a corn beef hash omelet. My omelet was good but the blueberry pancakes are FREAKIN DELICIOUS!! Typically I don't like sweet stuff for breakfast but man those pancakes were good. I kept asking for more! The pancakes are thick and fluffy with blueberries baked right into them. Topped them off with whipped cream-man, it was heaven.  I got sour dough bread as the bread-of-choice with my omelet. My pet peeve is that the sour dough breads are never sour enough. Theirs was good; just sour enough.  This is going to be my go-to breakfast place whenever I go to Vegas from now on.",

You can trust that mostly everything on the breakfast menu is made from scratch and will taste delicious.  The service can be slow because there is typically only one server on staff when I go late at night.  I've had both breakfast and dinner here: dinner is good but breakfast is great.  Blueberry Hill satisfies whether you need a late night post Las Vegas BLVD meal or a good breakfast in the morning to help with that hangover.",

Honestly, they don't taste any different than a Denny's or IHOP; good, just not different. They staff was nice. But the restaurant had uncomfortably small booths, the table was still sticky, though they wiped it again after we sat down. Not a terrible place but not great, I don't think we'll try it again.",

I usually order the Waitress Special; their waffles are phenomenal, YES even better than IHOP, I'm sorry to say to all IHOP fans.  Their waffles are crisp on the outside and so fluffy on the inside as it should be with waffles, it's almost like you're eating a lightly fried cloud smothered in sweet and delicious syrup.  And with a little help from Nestle Creamers, their coffee is Yum Yum, you can't have just one cup of coffee here; you say you're only going to have just one cup, but it's just so good, you have to have refill and why not???  Love this place. The servers are very friendly and talks to you like they've known you for years.  You go in hungry and take off feeling full and part of the family. :)",

I've had some mediocre food, and some fantastic food - so we keep going back.  It's also a great place in my neighborhood for breakfast if you don't want to go the casino route.    My new favorite is the Irish Benedict.  Corned beef hash instead of Canadian bacon - aside from that, standard Bene.  Super-tasty.  I like to get that and my husband gets an omlette with pancakes... we then trade 1/2 of my hashbrowns for one of his pancakes.  Perfect meal - although it's really too much food.  That doesn't stop me from eating it.  The cinnamon pancakes and apple pancakes are also very good.  I've tried the omlettes, the waffles, the french toast - all good stuff.  I think I've had dinner/lunch there once or twice.  I don't remember what I had, so clearly not memorable.  But, we keep going back.  It's never been bad food.  Prices are good for the amount that you get.",

I guess when you're used to going to norms everywhere else seems expensive. $30 for two people. A little on the high side but great food.

Not busy at all so we were greeted and seated immediately.  We had good service.  She was very attentive with our needs.  My coffee never went dry and we were checked on frequently.    Our breakfasts weren't as good as the service.  I ordered the Potato Pancake Eggs Benedict.  I was really underwhelmed with it.  While the eggs were done perfectly, as a whole it was just bland.  The potato pancake resting beneath the egg was very plain.  I wish the potatoes had more of a seasoning cooked in.  The hollandaise was also a disappointment.  It could really use some sprucing in the flavor department.    My husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak.  The look on his face told the story.  The steak was way overdone and dry.  The majority of his hash browns were really underdone.  I had to try them just to make sure he wasn't being picky.  But I believe he was right this time.    They really have an extensive menu so maybe I'll have to try one of their waffle or pancake creations. I'll just steer clear of the Benedict.",

I was at BH last nite at or around 1030 at nite. My fiancee ordered chicken n waffles and I had chili and a grill cheese. The grill cheese was perfect the chili was disgusting. There was no meat in it and it tasted like someone ran out of real chili and tried to fake it with refried beans and pintos they had left over and melted cheese on top. Either serve good chili or run out. The chicken was bland and greasy and was sent back. Now understand I'm not trying to do a hatchet job. I love BH and will continue to go here. The server was nice about the chicken took it back and replaced it with something else to our liking. I'm a chef and have been cooking professionally for over 17 years. IMO the night line crew dropped the ball.",

It's always been a bit of a dive kind of place - but this is the first time that I remember it actually being gross. Tables were sticky. Glasses had lipstick marks.   I don't know what was going on, but the staff was having some kind of angry discussion about work and tips - quite loudly. A manager seemed to be in on it too - complaining in front of customers about the lack of cleanliness behind the counter. If this was supposed to make us feel better, it didn't.  I ordered the most basic breakfast - 2 eggs, bacon, toast, coffee - and a side of a single potato pancake. The total was almost $16. The coffee alone was close to $3 - and was pretty dismal.  When I asked the server about the price, she said that I had ordered a breakfast combo called \"the Bonanza\" minus hashbrowns and pancakes. Plus an added single potato pancake. I told her that I had never ordered that combo - never even heard of it - and reiterated both what I had ordered and what I had received. She said that she didn't know how to ring that up, so had just put in an order for the Bonanza - minus about half of the meal - but still charged me the full price.   This feels like some sort of weird combination of incompetence and robbery. In the long run, it's probably only the difference of a couple of bucks - but it feels skeevy.   Seriously not impressed with the facilities, the servers, or the food.",

I was disappointed to find out their corned beef hash is not homemade, even though the front of the menu \"brags\" they make most everything in house.   It's almost a throwback to a 50's style diner, with the music and slight soda shop feel, but not quite hitting the mark as it also looks a little neglected and a lack of pride. The menus on the table had ketchup or other condiments on them.",

    "text": "Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant - East Flamingo Road  It's been years since I've stepped foot inside this Blueberry Hill.  But in the last week, I have been here twice. I was with a co-worker both times and we wanted something simple that fit both of our dietary needs.  One thing that's consistent with Blueberry Hill is their huge portions, great prices, and a menu with a decent selection of breakfast food.  On both visits, I got their Wild West Omelette for $11.89.  This omelet is made with 4 large eggs, slices of bacon, diced ham, and a ton of cheese. The description on their menu even states \"a lot of cheese\" is in their Wild West Omelette.  This omelet fit my diet perfect since it's high in protein and super high in fat.  This is one greasy omelet and I loved it.  The entire dish is hooked up with either a choice of pancakes or toast with hash browns.  The hash brown are okay and the pancakes are worth coming back for.  As for the service, we had a great experience on visit #2 and so-so service on visit #1.  I guess you can't win them all.  Overall, I will probably be back because I know what to expect and that's your typical breakfast dishes, great portions, and affordable prices.",

We almost turned around once we got to the parking lot, run down, sketchy, ect. But figured we'd try it anyways. Once inside I wasn't expecting a lot. And overall the food was OK. It wasn't anything special at all but it didn't taste bad.   The service though was awful. Very rarely do I care too much about how personable my server is or isn't, as long as they do their job, whatever. But she was rude and didn't do her job. She needs to find a new career choice. The manager that cashed us out was equally as rude. It was really mind boggling these people are working in customer service.   Also. How a grilled cheese, hamburger and two .99 kid meals equal up to $37 makes no sense to me. We pay that much for the 4 of us at a much better tasting restaurant with a nicer staff",

They just sat us, took about 5 minutes to bring over some menus, another 5 minutes to bring our drinks, then another 10 minutes to come take our orders. Mind you that there were only 4 other tables with customers because it was a midweek morning. If it were a weekend, the service would be totally understandable, but it was just annoying to watch the waitresses keep passing by us without taking our orders or refilling our cups.   Aside from the lazy service, the food was good (as usual). I had a Benedict, my mom had a spinach and cheese omelet, and my sister had huevos rancheros. All were very appetizing and huge in portion. The sauce they put on top of my Benedict was so flavorful and not too thick or watery. It was probably my favorite part of the dish.   I only wish the service matched the quality of the food. Even with us saying goodbye and thank you to the employees on our way out, we didn't get a single response. Unfortunately, I have to give this place 2 stars instead of 4 because I've experienced way better service at other locations.",

My sandwich was pretty dry..my bad for not requesting the bread to be toasted.  The GF had to surgically slice off bits of cold chicken fat from the chicken breast.  It was painful to watch.  I kept asking her if she was alright to which she affirmed while continued to excise the meat.  The staff was friendly and she did not raise a ruckus.  By the end our table was quite messy with chicken breast parts and dry toast when we finished.

    "text": "I really liked this place.  So much so that on a recent weeklong visit to Las Vegas, I ate here three times.  It's a chill spot serving up basic diner fare but keeping it a notch above the IHOPs and Denny's of the world.  Remember the end of Pulp Fiction (or middle) where Vincent and Jules are having breakfast at that diner that gets robbed.  Well, this is sorta that place minus the robbery.  Also, lots of big windows make the place much brighter than Tarantino's joint.  The first morning I had blueberry pancakes.  They're served three to an order and topped with blueberries, blueberry syrup and a dollop of whipped cream.  I asked the waitress if they came in a short stack because I didn't think I would finish them all.  She said no one does (finish them).  The verdict: excellent.    What really contributed to my liking of this place is the fact that it's a 'family restaurant'.  I was watching my three kids during the day while their mom attended conferences and it was no problem getting two of the rugrats into a booth while the other one was next to me in a car seat (she's only two months old).    Nobody was pissed that I had kids there.  A majority of the people were older, 50s or 60s.  It was a pleasant vibe for my family to enjoy breakfast.    It says it's open 24 hrs but I never got in beyond noon.  Buy my son was able to order spaghetti from the kids meal at 9am which was hella cool because he's not really into breakfast.    Everything was good which can be expected.  It wasn't tremendous or knock your socks off or high-end.  It was good which is what you expect when you go out for breakfast.",

My pancakes were great however ruining pancakes is a feat in itself. I wouldn't eat here again since I ended up paying $32.71 for three small plates and water.  For the money egg works or sunrise cafe are twice as good. Hope this was useful.  Also a small side not, there was a dog loose in their parking lot and I asked for a piece of bread or something to try and coax it to me and they were going to charge me for a side of sausages, I wasn't going to eat it! They lacked compassion and if you can't treat an animal right how can you treat a person right. No wonder the service was terrible.",

    "text": "Find your thrill at Blueberry Hill  I love this place.  Part of it is because it's a great diner / pancake house that puts IHOP to shame.  The other reason is because it primarily caters to locals.  Look around, lots of blackjack dealers and cage cashiers grab a bite here after their shifts at the casino.  Blueberry Hill's menu is extensive and includes pages of breakfast, lunch, dinner, specials, and desserts.  It's overwhelming, you have to focus.  The only meal I've had here has been breakfast.  My favorite is the \"Little Boy Blue.\"  It's two blueberry pancakes with whipped cream, two eggs, and two slices of bacon or sausage  The pancakes are made-from-scratch, old-fashioned buttermilk pancakes.  The waitresses are friendly, atmosphere informal, and the prices are a bargain.   Even if you don't win in the casino, you'll certainly be a winner at this place.",

Very fresh and tasty...home style cooking.   5 stars for Mexican style Chilaquiles with a home-made spicy red sauce     10 stars for the incredibly friendly and helpful waitress who made a great impression on our whole extended family. (-:  Thank you!!! Everyone was delighted.  5 stars for outstanding value. Lots of great meals at Blueberry Hill for under $10. This was fun and a great place for all of us to stretch our vacation budgets!  Our waitress had worked at Blueberry Hill for a while, and our great experience is probably influenced by the fact that she made sure each and every one of us ordered something we would love! Her advice was right on, and she was patient.     It's an easy 5- minute drive off the strip so tourists staying on the strip need a car.   If I lived in Vegas I would eat breakfast here frequently. (-: This is a diner...it ain't fancy, but it's extremely tasty, friendly, and a great value. (Save your pennies for the slot machines! (-: )  We all voted to eat here twice because we were tired of paying a bundle to eat on the strip and then being disappointed with the food on the strip. We found Blueberry Hill on yelp. There is more than one location.  We selected this location. THANKS yelpers!  Unlike a previous reviewer, I chose not to deduct any stars for decor. This is a diner...it looks like a diner. But it tastes like the BEST diner!  (-:  The menu is huge, so if you happen to get a new waitress, it's possible she may not be able to direct you towards the very best dishes. We were lucky as our waitress knew what to recommend when we asked questions.",

We get there, seat ourselves (per usual) this guy comes to our table, can't speak a word of English and is trying to take our drink order. He repeats it wrong like twice and we just looked at each other. He says to \"hold on\" then a girl comes, she can speak English but not very well. She was really nice and tried her best. I got water and my friend got an iced coffee. She brings the drinks and my friends coffee has a giant spoon in it. It's coffee, not a milk shake. I order my food. I get the French toast special and order my eggs \"basted\". She comes out with my food and my eggs are so runny and undercooked it was disgusting. I showed the server and she says \"okay let me have them make you new ones\" she comes out later, puts the new plate of eggs on the table and I kid you not, the eggs were so over cooked it looked like a hard boiled egg. Like was that supposed to be a \"screw you\" from the chef?! I was so tired of complaining I just didn't even say anything and took them like that. I won't go back anytime soon.",

My boyfriend ordered some sort of steak that has bacon and cheese on top of it. It also came with hasbrowns, eggs, and toast. It was also really good. We never saw a steak with bacon and melted cheese on top! It's so bad yet so good. Haha! The server accidentally brought the wrong toast, so we ended up getting that extra toast for free. I can't complain aboout free food! The portions are huge, so it's worth the prices. Also, the server was very friendly and funny, so she made my experience even better.

    "text": "No, just no! So mad! We've been going here for years. I think some of the menu items are absolutely delicious, some could be better. But nonetheless, this experience was a no.   Breakfast for my family, two adults-two kids, was $38. I was thinking, how is this possibly so high when I ordered one breakfast for me and shared it with my four year old, and all my six year old son had was a side of curly fries. Well I found it, $12 for kids drinks!! Twelve. Dollars. My husband and I had water, and we ordered two kids milks. When they were gone, I asked if there were refills on the milks. I know most restaurants don't refill on that product, but some do. So when the server said there are no free refills of milk, that was fine. Then I asked if we could  get something cheaper than milk, like iced tea, and she replied it was fine.   When I got the bill, the teas were charged. I took the bill to the register and told her we shouldn't have to pay for tea after paying $6 for two 12 ounce milks. I told her the server did not inform us there was an additional charge. She called our server over and the server said \"I told them there were no refills on milk.\" I said, well I took that as there's no refills of milk, and I asked if something cheaper could be the refill, and you said it was okay. I told them you should have said, I can get tea but it will be an additional charge, and I would have said never mind.  Either way, they we're rude about it, and dishonest. Because I pointed out that we were charged almost $3 PER cup. That is the adult price on a drink. She said it's the same size. I informed her I've worked in a restaurant. Those are 12 ounce cups and if that's what you charge for a 12 ounce drink that is a huge rip off. Tea is water and leaves, it shouldn't be that much for an adult or kid. A kids milk shouldn't even be $3. Rip. Off. It takes a lot to make me upset at a business or someone doing their job, but I don't appreciate the attitudes or a $38 bill for two breakfasts and a side of curly fries.",

    "text": "Came here for a business meeting earlier this week. I have a client that works just up the street on Flamingo and Pecos. We came here on a Tuesday afternoon. The place had a few people in it. We were greeted by a sweet lady who took us to our table.   When it comes to holding meetings at a restaurant, you don't want to go somewhere that's too loud or busy. You also want to make sure the server is mindful so they don't interrupt you too much while you're in the meeting! Blueberry Hill is always my joint. They're subtle, the food is great and it's affordable.   Just like the other Blueberry Hills, it is a typical American diner decor and feel. There are booth seating and tables as well. It was clean the day we came wit fun, 50's music playing softly in the background. I love it all! There's also so much hustle and bustle happening in the kitchen as the cooks work hard to make the orders.   My client ordered the club sandwich and I ordered the biscuits and gravy with sausage and bacon. We split a cinnamon roll pancake. SO GOOD! I'd come back again for the pancakes and the gravy. The portions were suitable for the price paid, especially the pancakes.   Overall, we enjoyed our meal and the service.The food was good. My client was happy, and it was nice and close to him. We will be back again soon!   - JT",

    "text": "After a short hike at the Clark County Wetlands Park, my friend and I had planned to go to Blueberry Hill for breakfast.  Thinking the closest one was near UNLV, I put this address on my GPS and it turned out top be much closer to where we were than going to near Maryland and Flamingo which was more convenient for both of us.  We were brought coffee quickly as we studied the menu.  My order was for a Texas chili omelette with hash browns and rye toast.  My friend ordered the chicken apple compote waffle.  We had some time to chat but it wasn't long before our breakfasts were brought.  My omelette was served open-faced with the egg on the cooked egg on the bottom and topped with chili, onions, and cheese.  There is a choice of sides and I got hash browns and rye toast.  My friend's waffle was in quarters--each topped with a small breaded, fried piece of chicken breast, and topped with apple compote.  I left much of the potatoes, a slice of toast, but my friend finished his waffle.  Portion sizes have always been large at Blueberry Hill.  We enjoyed a good breakfast.  Blueberry Hill is good diner food.  It's the first time I've been to one in about 5 years, and I'm glad this was the place chosen by my friend for our after hike breakfast get together.",

I am a sucker for potatoes, so I ordered the potato pancakes with bacon, eggs, and a side of hash browns - cause potatoes. The pancakes were very flavorful, but not too heavy. Came with sour cream and apple sauce, both of which were good and gave the pancakes a different flavor. The bacon was perfectly crispy and very flavorful. Hash browns weren't undercooked, which I feel is often the case at diners. Would definitely recommend.  My fiance had the meat lovers skillet and we both were drooling. It wasn't too salty which can often happen when there is cheese. The perfect amount of ingredients as well...there was never too much green pepper or not enough ham. Thick slice of sourdough toast as well.   Portions were very generous. We both have at least one more meal in leftovers. This is very much an old school diner vibe and our waitress was wonderful, attentive, offered recommendations, and we never had empty drinks. Would be a great place to cure a hangover    We're visiting from out of town but I suspect we might come back again before we leave, and we'll definitely be back the next time we're in town.",

Even though it was super busy we were sat very fast so I was happy about that.  I had the boy blue or something it was a blueberry pancake combo with 2 eggs and choice of protein. Everyone on yelp raved about the blueberry pancakes so I had to try and I loved them. The compote was not too sweet. I usually hate too much stuff on pancakes but I'd go back for it again for sure.",

I would order turkey dinner from time to time. their homemade/restaurant chicken noodle soup is a must have! breakfast here are also good--blueberry waffles or pancakes are hot and tasty.  Iris egg Benedict is a must! corn beef instead of ham for the Benedict. yummy! haven't try anything new yet cause I have a habit of re ordering what I like and stick with it. maybe much later but for now, it'll be meatloaf, & turkey dinner plates plus chicken noodle soup if I'm super hungry. blueberry pancakes/waffles for desserts or brunch.   it's a cozy place to eat at.",

I've never tried an item on their menu that I didn't like. The staff is friendly and the food gets to your table quick, even on busier days. I rarely need to doctor it up by adding extra seasoning. Not to mention the fact that that you can show up in your PJs and no one bats an eye. If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor and go get some.",

When management heard that we had Food Poisoning at another Blue Berries Restaurant in Las Vegas & were violently ill, they offered to pay for our breakfast as compensation.  The Blue Berry Hill Sandhill/E Flamingo restaurant has been our family restaurant for many years.  The food is consistently good, & the restaurant is always clean, & well managed.  We have never been sick!  Today's breakfast was outstanding.  They have a friendly & caring staff who always demonstrate outstanding customer service.  Thank you Blue Berries - Sandhill for taking such good care of us.  Hopefully, the other Vegas Blue Berries will use you as a role model.",

We stopped by about 10:30am after being told their was an hour wait to be seated at Mr Momma's. We were immediately seated. The restaurant was clean and well decorated. The staff was fast, friendly, helpful. And above all the breakfast was amazing!  I had the classic eggs Benedict, while my husband had the meat lovers scramble. Their was an abundance of food! The ham was thick cut, unlike any Benedict I have had before. As did my husbands meat lovers scramble, large cubes of ham. Would have prefered it a little thinner but wasn't a deal breaker by far :)",

When I go I always order \"The Little Boy Blue\" which comes with blueberry pancakes, two pieces of bacon or sausage, and your choice of eggs. I also order a side of their hash browns that are made fresh. You can definitely taste the difference between Denny's and Blueberry Hill.  The blueberry pancakes I order are so delicious! There's no need for syrup on these pancakes because they top it with blueberries, and blueberry jam. What's the point of going to a placed named \"Blueberry Hill\" without trying any of their blueberry concoctions?  Whatever you decide on ordering in the end will not disappoint. My word of advice however, be ready to want to come back for more!",

    "text": "This Blueberry Hill location has been a  regular favorite of ours for some time now, however for our most recent visit everything was just.. meh, and perhaps even not-so-good. Perhaps they were having an off day. We've eaten here many, many times and this time we just didn't feel that the level of food quality, and service was at it's best.  We were there for breakfast as usual. The hash browns were over cooked on both our plates, and overall the food just didn't seem to be cooked to (or served with) the typical care that we have been accustomed to here. We had a new server, and she did a good enough job for being new, however the server who was training her made a slight off-color comment about her at one point, which concerned us a bit. We thought it was inappropriate and unnecessary. In the end as we paid for our meal, the cashier asked us \"how was everything\" and we said, \"well... honestly it wasn't as good as usual\". She looked at us, then looked back down but didn't reply to our comment. She simply took our payment saying something robotic like \"thank you,\".  We'll probably be back again someday, but this restaurant is no longer at the top of our \"go-to\" list for breakfast on this side of town. I hope that when we return, they have brought their service, food quality and care back up to where their prior standards have been. I'd love to put them back up to the top of our go-to for local breakfast list - I'm rooting for them!",

We got seated right away on a Sunday morning around 10am. The place has a diner-ish vibe with booths, tables, and the breakfast bar lined with cake stands filled with colossal cakes of different flavors and colors.  The menu is overwhelming, there's just so much to pick from including a tex-mex array. From sweet French toasts and pancakes to savory skillet style omelets, there's something for every breakfast lover. There is a kids menu for your little ones, portion sizes are awesome too since my kids are 7 & 4 and have growing appetites! Although my kids Apple juice drinks were not refillable. Just in case you got thirsty kids like mine. Husband got the meatloaf, and I got the fried steak. I love hash browns and theirs were on point this morning. Coffee was refilled on a regular, the wait staff was super attentive and boss! I don't think they share tables since we had the same person throughout our breakfast.  I'll definitely be back to try more stuff on their menu. Prices were great for portion size. Restroom was surprisingly clean for how busy it was that morning, and given the assumption of how old the facility is.",

    "text": "I've been to all the Blueberry Hill restaurants in town even the long time gone great one in Henderson. This one is the best, you can expect great service and great diner food.  The atmosphere is classic diner with the requisite oldies playing in the background. I've had a variety of their omelettes (always plump, fluffy, and never over cooked), chicken fried steak and eggs, Tennessee fried steak, chorizo and eggs and their amazing fluffy pancakes. Today I had a craving for their Tito Bandito Plate, steak and eggs smothered in cheese onions and salsa. It comes with beans, rice, thick homemade chips, tortillas, pico, sour cream and shredded lettuce to make tacos. The steak is tasty, hearty, but a little chewy unless you cut it across the grain. The beans are refried but fresh not heavy or pasty, an excellent combination plate. It doesn't normally come with pancakes but I ordered them anyway because they are the best in town. Fluffy mounds of weight gain.   The service is super attentive, they are constantly checking on you regardless of the crowd demands, and they are personable and friendly at all times.",

If your a big group they do not have much seating for big parties. They have the big round booth but for boys who don't want to even touch each other not a good idea. We had told the waitress we were in a little bit of a hurry but understand food takes time but if there would be a long wait. she assured us there wouldn't be a problem. We waited almost an hour to get our food. It was breakfast. The only thing that should have taken longer was my skillet. Everyone else had basic scrambled eggs, bacon, toast. I then realized how high the prices are for just that order. $12.99 for that times 5 people plus $12.99 for the skillet (which is ok). Then you add the drinks..our bill was over $100 for breakfast. I could have went to Ikea and paid $2.99 for that and more and fed the entire team for under $100. The menu is more of an upscale breakfast in a low scale atmosphere. Unfortunately we wont be back.",

My wife ordered crispy bacon, which I dislike, but somehow got on my order too. I like my bacon flexible not  crispy. I don't like to send food back that should be hot and prepared to my liking in the first place. I just show my discontent in the tip I leave.

So fluffy and warm and the strawberries are a perfect compliment as they are real strawberries. The French toast is also great!! Nice amount of sweetness to it.

I don't mean meh kinda warm, it was cold. After sending eggs benedict and bisquits n gravy back to be \"nuked\" the waitress disappeared. By the time she did return I was to livid to say or do anything but pay n leave. I ordered my eggs poached or fried hard. My eggs were so runny .....even after it was reheated in microwave. As we were leaving to pay, waitress was nowhere to be seen. Then we notice heat lamp in food window not on n food just sitting. Now I know why my food was so cold. Sat in the window far to long! Be awhile before I return.",

Ordered drinks and she left before taking everyone's drink order. After she returned she brought the rest of the drink and she took our meal order. The first 2 plates arrived 30 minutes later, the next 2 ten minutes later. The last 3 meals arrived 15 minutes later, and they were not correctly made. A milk shake that was ordered upon arrival was never brought. We asked for a manager numerous times and one never appeared. At one point they sent out a dishwasher that just nodded at us. The table  next to us arrived 10 minutes after we did, and they received their food about 20 minutes before us. Their food all arrived at the same time, and keep in mind they were a bigger party. Maybe the server taught they were better tippers. After we finished the bland meal, we received two separate checks. As we went to pay we noticed that they automatically add a 15 percent gratuity to the check. That was the last straw, we informed the hostess that we would pay the bill but no the gratuity. One of the servers told her to do so, the manager never came out. DO NOT EAT THERE, waste of time for bad food.",

Really, split it among two people.  I did not need to touch the syrup with the abundance of fruit on top.  Coffee was typical breakfast joint coffee.  The service was good, staff very friendly.  There are $4.99 weekday specials.  This would have been an even better deal if it was split because of the amount of food on the plate.  I ate 2.5 of the four and I am no small guy.

As it turns out, there are a few places that I've been missing out on all this time.   Blueberry Hill is one of them. Thankfully it's open 24 hours, otherwise we'd be going to some shady or overpriced place to get some grub at 1 in the morning after flying into Sin City at a late flight.   We were immediately sat, which was a relief and something of a surprise; there seems to be fewer 24/7 spots the farther you get from The Strip, but the place had people, but wasn't packed. Inside basically looks like what an old IHOP would look like, except their mascot, which is a boy in overalls having more than a good time pouring a bucket of blueberries all over himself adorns the interior.   The menu has a great selection of stuff on both sides of one menu panel. Breakfast is served all day, and their non-breakfast items are pretty well varied as well. Prices and portions are adequate, but definitely not the best deal. But the food is good! I had the biscuits and gravy, which was the second best I've had in a while, and they have very, very delicious fries. Food comes out fairly quickly, even though the actual service isn't the quickest.   Though we're apart...I'll still return to Blueberry Hill next time I'm back in town for sure.",

All of it was great, the pancakes were amazing (probably best I've had), corn beef hash great and omeletcake huge but amazingly good that my brother had to eat the entire thing (which is pretty hard to do since it's at least a pound of food).

She's no urban adventurer either, so I was surprised to see that she left the Strip to find a new breakfast spot. One of the things I love and hate about Vegas are the plethora of eateries in your hotel, forcing you to stay in. But a favorite pastime of mine now is to venture from the Strip to find the local favorites.    I think I struck gold with Blueberry Hill. Everything, and I mean everything I've ever had here has been mouthwatering, hangover-curing, delicious.  Whether it's savory or sweet - it's ALL good here. I usually go for the Dealer's Special with a hamsteak and hash browns, but another good option is any number of the Mexican breakfasts with chorizo.  Even the breakfast burrito was impressive. Their signature blueberry pancakes do not disappoint either.  It's unassuming with its dumpy naughahyde booth diner look.  But that's why it's even more of a surprise find.  You can easily eat here for under $10.    Btw, there's a location just east of Maryland Parkway that's closer to the Strip.",

By the way, there are 4 or 5 other locations and all are equally good (but as some other yelpers have noticed, lunch and dinner are not their strong points--stick to breakfast and you won't be disappointed).",

    "text": "We've eaten at this location more than a few times for breakfast and dinner, but tonight will be the last time. They consistently get orders incorrect and we've overlooked it on past occasions, but tonight was the worst experience ever. The cups of chili were cold to lukewarm, we had dirty silverware on our table, and the waitress was totally disinterested, never re-filled our sodas and refused to make even minor adjustments to our sandwiches like changing out sauteed onions for raw onions on a patty melt. It was almost laughable that she had to refer to the menu to see which burger we were referring to when my husband ordered a simple double cheeseburger.  She was poorly trained and argumentative. I had to send a patty melt back for being undercooked and topped with the wrong type of cheese. I got it back with a few flakes of unmelted shredded cheddar. The flakes of cheese on the burger were not melted and those stuck to the bread were burnt black. The fries were cold. The plate of food looked messy and unappetizing. I requested a manager and was told none were on duty. Now I understand why this chain is closing store by store. They have definitely lost interest in quality of food and customer service.",

Had breakfast with my sister's family here before leaving town. I ordered the special with pancakes instead of toast. SO GOOD! I did make the mistake of taking a bite of my sister's french toast. By mistake I mean I almost pinched her under the table like when we were kids so that I could take an exta bite!  They do have awesome mac and cheese here, which is weird that I know that, but the neices were fighting over the last few bites. I took a stray roni - and mmmm cheesy goodness! I also asked for a little more iced tea when the check arrived. She brought it to me in a gigantic to-go cup so that i could have it on the drive back :) how nice is that?! and when I tripped on the curb(dork alert) clenched my cup too hard and poke a hole in the styrofoam from my GI Joe kung fu grip, she brought me another one.  to sum it up - yummy made from scratch goodness, superb service, and good prices!",

I got on Yelp from my cell phone and found a Blueberry Hill restaurant nearby.  This place did not disappoint. They have a ton of options and everything was good. The blueberry pancakes were good, the biscuits and gravy were good and we had an enormous meal for three for about $30 including drinks. This place is a great deal and it's close to the strip. Skip the casinos when you're hungry for breakfast and head here instead.",

If we lived in the area, this would be the place we'd go when everyone is too drunk to make any other decision...greasy, doughy food that serves the sole purpose of soaking up excess alcohol.   Here we had a sullen waitress, approximately 15 out of 20 tables with dirty dishes stashed on them, old fogies having coffee after gambling away their money on the slot machines at the entrance, and a parking lot best suited for a carjacking.",

Decently priced and with helpful service the only downside are some of the regulars who tend to be retirees who take forever to make their decisions which ocassionally means you have to wait for service to make their way to you.",

She apologizes and brings me another plate just to now find a SECOND hair on the ham again before I even touched the food . Of course I let her know I told her I didn't want anything anymore and the manager come to our table to tell me she has taken the meal off the ticket like DUH !!!! I was not about to pay for that nasty food ! We then get our check to find they had charged us for the xtras we had ordered for that same meal which at this point I was just so furious I kept quiet because any other place  would've gave u a discount or at least not charge for the xtra salsa or jalapenos that were ordered. Needless to say we're not going back to this place for the way the manager Linda handled the situation!",

The one thing that maybe I complained about is my toast was cold and that has probably happened less than twice and it was never a big deal. The best Blueberry Hill is on Flamingo and Rochelle or maybe it's Flamingo and Tamaras. That's the best one the second to best one is on Flamingo and Decatur it's a newer building and then there's another one over there off of Decatur and Charleston. The one on Decatur and Charleston is a little bit not up to par with the customer service but it's still great food. My husband usually gets the Chile cheeseburger I usually get the pork chops and eggs and my daughter usually get pancakes eggs and bacon and everybody's always very happy",

The pancakes and French toast are really tasty.  For me, what put them over the top was the hot blueberry syrup I poured over the top with big blueberries in it!  That was super!  The service was pretty good.  I've had very few places in Vegas offer poor service though.  If you've traveled other places you probably know what I mean - we tend to, overall, have really good service here in the Vegas area.

The service is good, the food is good (great French toast) they have a ton of options to choose from. It is not just your every day breakfast stop. I was excited to see chicken and waffles on the menu, but decided against it as the chicken was filleted and not fried with bone. I ended up getting the Waitress Special which had eggs, choice of sausage, bacon or ham, a waffle and toast. I would say it was decent. This place is not for the faint of heart. I'm a picky egg and chicken eater, if your not and you like salt, this place will be great! my husband had the ham and cheese omelette that came out about twice this size you would anticipate, it could easily be shared and he said he liked it. They really push the iced coffee which comes in an old blue plastic cup and leaves a a lot to be desired. I would much rather have paid $5 at Starbucks then the $2.69 for that, I ended up not drinking most of it.   We love going to local restaurants, we will most likely be back again:)",

My wife got it and I almost ate two breakfasts it was so good. On the second day, I got Eggs Benedict on potato pancakes. Absolutely delicious. The potato pancakes are made from hash browns, unlike the mashed potato version I'm used to. They're perfectly seasoned and a good size. Eggs Benedict had Canadian bacon that was easily a half inch thick. Oh, and the rye toast is some real deli type rye! Not the skinny piece of flavorless rye you get at a lot of breakfast spots.

Everything was delicious.   I had the full house. The crepes were perfect. My friend had the waitress special with eggs over medium. The eggs were cooked to perfection and tasted very fresh.  The waffle had great flavor.   Great experience on a busy Saturday morning.  ,,",

Besides today I've actually come to this location many times over the years because their breakfast is always great.  There always seems to be people in here eating all the time when  I come here.  It has a relaxed atmosphere and they play old school sock hop  music.  Has that diner feel to it as well.    Server was on top of things for the most part and she was nice and friendly.  Besides the music the background noise is kinda loud with the dishes clanking and silverware crashing together.  All the way around its a nice budget breakfast!  Check it out",

The hostess was an older lady and did not say anything except how many. I said 1. She said you can sit at the counter. I told her I don't like sitting at counters.  She then said that then I would have to wait for a while. I asked how long and she said as long as it takes. Since I have to be back in Mesa by 5, I sat at the counter, as I watched her sit IMMEDIATELY two separate couples after me. I confronted her and she said, I told u I didn't know how long. I got up and left. I don't need to spend my money in an establishment that is unfriendly and has no morals. A lie came out of her mouth as easy as it is to walk",

Apparently we usually visit the location just west on Flamingo. How could this be a big deal though? It's a local chain diner.   I don't know where this location went wrong, but everything was a considerable step below the BHFR I expected. The coffee, just warm. The service, noticeably slow (at every step). The food, not quite to snuff (very little butter on our pancakes, eggs were cooler than the rest of our dish, and some very fatty bacon).   Of course I'd try again on the name alone -- but it won't be at this location.",

She got the attitude with me and said that she brought it out already. I said that the bacon was touching the sausage and she can't eat it. She made a weird noise and walked away. I went and spoke with the manager and she took care us and discounted the check. When people have food allergies you should fix the plates right. Plus the food wasn't the best.

Came in for lunch and was immediately seated, it was not very packed, I assume it's because of the weather. I usually drive by and the parking lot is full.  The only thing that disappointed me are the specials. They have different ones for different days of the week and they only serve them on the days assigned. I will definitely be coming back on a Tuesday for their pot roast special.   I decided to go with the popeye chicken. It was really yummy. It came with green beans, mashed potatoes with gravy and a side of chicken noodle soup. The chicken itself in the entree was really juicy, smothered in cheese and spinach.  The chicken noodle soup was very hearty. I was very satisfied with my meal.  To finish the meal off, I ordered a stack of the Oreo pancakes. All I can say is WOW. I had never seen such big, beautiful, fluffy pancakes. I took a bite and my taste buds exploded. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and our food came out pretty quick. The restaurant itself has a nice, old school vibe. I need to come here often and try everything!",

The prices are great and they give you loads of food.  The service was great...our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Coffee cups were refilled continuously and to me that's always a good thing :)  Oh and the Blueberry pancakes are so yummy. They are large so you might want to share. It was too early for me to order dinner but it all looked so good. Next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely consider this place for a nice home-style cooked meal.",

Contrary to the sample, there were absolutely no vegetables (replaced with corn). But the worse was the taste and looks of everything. Most of the ingredients looked extremely cheap, artificial and had no taste whatsoever. All of us barely ate 1/4 of the dish and had to stop, despite being very hungry. Hoped for the pies, just to find out they were not any better and ultra sweet. A True shame.",

The menu has so many choices that it is laminated and spiral bound.  There's a whole page just for Mexican breakfasts.    The color pictures make it hard to decide which meal to order; that's my second complaint.  My breakfast was delayed because it took me a while to tell the waitress which dish I wanted.  Butter cream waffles or french toast stuffed with cream cheese and topped with pineapple-coconut-rum?  Apple chicken sausage omelette or potato pancakes with sour cream?    And then there's the fine print; watch out for hidden extras!  I ordered a corned beef hash skillet and it came topped with potatoes and eggs over easy accompanied by a toast & jelly.  My husband's blueberry pancakes were huge and thick, with blueberries in & out, and topped with whipped cream and even he couldn't finish them.  Everything was delish.  Good variety of lunch & dinner items too, but you're out of luck if you're a vegetarian; even the salads all have meat or fish in them.  This place is extremely clean & bright, even the bathroom smelled good.  The waitress was extremely personable and attentive.  I'd eat here every day if I could.",

All items on the menu are great portions and qulaity food, they advertise on their site that they use fresh OJ, bacon and ham from Oscar mayer, etc. You can actually tatse the difference compatred to a Denny's or IHOP.   4 stars because they are little pricier than other diners but still cheap overall,so more like 4.5 stars.",

The valet guy at The Flamingo recommended us to his local breakfast diner, saying that it was really good! Just a few short miles from the hotel, we ran across a huge blue sign for the restaurant. Indeed, the restaurant was filled with locals. The prices were much more reasonable than those at restaurants on The Strip, and yes, the food was quite good! I ordered the Mexican Chilaquiles, and the flavors were fantastic! A heap of eggs sat atop cheese and homemade chips, with a side of Mexican rice, beans, lettuce, and sour cream. The dish was accompanied by a spicy sauce as well, which definitely heated up the dish! Great food, overall.",

Recently, they've changed their menu up a bit and have a few new selections that look really good that I haven't had the chance to try.  This last time I visited I had a pork fritter dinner.  Okay, so even the server couldn't tell me what was in the pork fritter exactly, but it was pretty darn tasty.  I know, it's a breakfast place...I should probably have ordered breakfast.  The service at this particular location is a little hit and miss.  You can tell who the regulars are as they occupy the majority of the server's time.  Once you get your order in, the wait for your food to come is average but getting your beverage refilled may be a little difficult if you're the shy type.  Overall, not a bad place to go and definitely worth the drive from the strip to save a little extra for that slot machine that keeps winking at you on your way to your room.",

Unfortunately the coffee here was watery.   -pigs in a blanket: frou-frou sausages designed by some SF chef wrapped in pancakes, sprinkled liberally with powdered sugar and served with maple syrup. Pretty good. I could swear that the pancakes had some cornmeal in them? They had this odd combination of tasting pleasantly of corn, but also being very, very fluffy.  -omelet. denver, i think. My husband said it was just ok. It looked really, really greasy. It came with pancakes.   -chocolate layer cake: dry. Not very tasty.  The bathrooms were very clean.",

    "text": "We were visiting Las Vegas and my husband recommended this place he had eaten at before, off the strip.  We are pretty healthy eaters and stay away from buffets due to the enormous selection and hefty price tags associated with buffets.  My husband and I opted for the egg-white omelet and my son ordered a half order of the oreo pancakes.  Shame on me for not asking about portion size, but when the plates arrived, it was enough to feed 6 people, not 3.  I even told the waitress, I wish you would have informed us about the portion size because I will not be able to eat 1/2 of my plate.  She delightfully said we could take it home in a to go box, which I'm sure most of their patrons are from out of town, so I wouldn't be surprised if they don't tell people hoping to increase their check total. I was stuffed at 1/2 the plate and was forcing myself to eat a little more because I hated that it would go to waste. The omelets were fine, nothing special, the hashbrown side was not very tasty, and those were left untouched on the plate.  My son enjoyed his oreo pancakes, and even with a 1/2 order of 2 pancakes, there was still 1 and 1/4 pancakes on his plate.  Ii have to add the highlight of the meal was the sourdough toast!  Absolutely, phenomenal!  There were 4 pieces between the 3 of us, and we all wanted more.  So, the bill comes and it is a whopping $38 for 2 adults and a child.  We would have been better off eating at a buffet!  The food was decent, but if I were to go back, I'm splitting an order with someone!",

    "text": "Hubby and I spent the weekend in Vegas. Tried this place one morning, and The Egg and I the next. Blueberry Hill wins, no contest. Moist, flavorful veggie omelet and the shoestring potatoes were by far the best I've ever had. Freshly made, not frozen, browned crispy. My blue berry muffin was outstanding, not overly sweet.  Hubby had a Scramble but I can't remember which one. He loved it, and he's hard to please. Service was good, even tho the waitress seemed to be having a tiff with a customer. Prices were beyond reasonable. We'd go back for all our breakfasts in Vegas.",

So good. The waffle was thick and sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon. The fried chicken had a thin breading and very flavorful. Together they were the perfect cure for my new year's hangover. It's a nice place for some good quality food and appropriately priced.",

    "text": "blueberry hill is one of those classic late night or morning after huts to frequent when you need something quick, reliable, and tasty. I have personally grown up on the alaskan waffle topped with ice cream and strawberries. I've also experienced blueberry hill for morning after bloody mary's and night coconut cream pie. Regardless of your late night foodie needs, blueberry hill is a great place to stuff your face and shoot the shit for as many hours as you please with a smiling face and full mug of coffee ready to go.",
