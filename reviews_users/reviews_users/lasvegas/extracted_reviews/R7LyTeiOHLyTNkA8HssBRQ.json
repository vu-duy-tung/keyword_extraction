    "text": "'Rito only review!!  Tough one to call here. Needed a quick bit and out of nowhere come Los Tacos. Checked out the menu and the $3 tacos really sent me for a loop, so I went for a burrito (I don't know why I even tried NOT to eat one). 5$ and change nets you a 'rito, but it's only meat and beans. Guac, sour cream and cheese will run you an extra $1.50. If you can turn down that magical combo of toppings, you're a better man than I. End total was $7 and change. The 'rito result was mixed. It had just below average girth and solid length, which I think would make most people happy (although the rumor is women enjoy....). Anyway, it was solid. The al pastor wasn't the greatest, but honestly if you peep my pic, you can see that even below average meat was masked by the toppings. It was a good 'rito. Not great. Not 5-star.  3.5 star with a bump bc it had a drive thru. I'll go taco diving next time and report back... Wait....",

When we got there we went through the drive thru cause it was empty and there was a couple people inside and decide it would be faster going drive thru. Anyway they took my order fast and we ordered 5 tacos. Got to the window and she charged us quickly and repeated the order of 5 tacos to us. Then the waiting game began. They did this last time to but I assumed they were busy. This time they weren't. It took 20 minutes for us to get out incorrect order of 4 tacos.   Called Tony the manager and never once did he apologize. He said you have a receipt number. I said no and I wasn't going back either I just wanted to let you know what should be corrected for next time. And TONY never apologized or anything. So there won't be a next time.    So yes tacos are good, but expect to wait very long for your small order and know that the service sucks and these people work with no sense of urgency. One girl was moving fast, but everyone else was moving very slow and holding conversations. Good managing TONY. Your amazing. Being very sarcastic.   LONG WAITS. HORRIBLE service.",

We were greeted by a very  friendly, very muscled up guy who took our order. After ordering he told us we ordered too much food. Remember, we've never been here. He made his recommendation and we filled his advice! He was right!  We ordered the lengua, cabeza, and the al pastor along with some chips and salsa. The salsa was so fresh and delicious and the chips were crispy and warm. The tacos....holy guacamole they were amazing!! I've become quite the taco connisour and these are top of the top!  The guy who took our order not only checked to make sure our food was good, he knew we were first timers,  he came back to the table to talk to us and treat us like family!  I highly recommend this place! We will definitely be back and look forward to trying everything on the menu!",

They don't typically take phone orders especially for 10 people but they did for us which I thought was nice of them.   I have tried the asada, chicken & pastor. I have to say the asada is my favorite. They're full of flavor and they are huge with great portions! I add guacamole, cheese & sour cream (extra $$)   I would stick to their tacos (considering they're known for that) my coworkers have tried their sea food and they're not as in love with this place as I am.

The price is a little higher than some might expect, but my experience with this location has been consistent for years.

I went in not having much else to go off of but a recommendation from a friend.   Their menu is rather simple, but it's got all the bases covered. Standard tacos, burritos, and quite a bit more with an impressive selection of aguas frescas. I ordered the carne asada tacos, and got to try a bit of my friend's shrimp cocktail. Oh my god, yes.   The ingredients were fresh and colorful, the carne asada was probably some of the  best I've had in a good while, and the presentation was just right. The burritos also looked amazing, but I didn't get to try that. The portions are also pretty great!  The aguas frescas they had were pretty fantastic, too. I got the strawberry first, and then another watermelon one for the road. Considering it's barely spring as I'm writing this, they tasted very nice! I would have expected they wouldn't taste very good because of the lack of availability of fresh fruit, but I was wrong again!  Overall, completely worth it. The price is a little higher than most places, but there's some real quality work put into this place. Hopefully to become my go-to mexican place ^_^",

    "text": "***Update***  I decided to give this place a second try since a friend kept raving about their food. The menu prices on the website are incorrect. The menu prices at the restaurant are higher. The tacos come here with beans. One taco is double the size of your typical taco. The cashier asked me what toppings I wanted. I asked for onions and cilantro. She said there's onions and cilantro in the pico. Um, OK. I've never heard of that before in a simple carne asada taco. Also, I asked for no beans. There's a $1 charge to remove the beans. WTF? It's not even mixed in together.   They nickel and dime you for every topping. My two carne asada tacos and shrimp tostada came out to a whopping $16.22! If I ordered a drink, it would have been close to $20. I can understand if I was at a fancy Mexican restaurant but these prices are excessive for a casual Mexican place. The food wasn't good enough to justify the price. There was barely any seasoning with my meat and without my cilantro and onions, it wasn't the same. Also, I wasn't pleased with the paper thin slices of avocado. I can find better tasting tacos in L.A. for a lot less.   So again, the cashier wasn't very friendly. The menus are not clear nor descriptive. Where are these toppings on the menu? Outrageous prices for mediocre tacos. No thanks. This place made me miss L.A. a lot.",

For $18, I got two carne asada tacos and a shrimp tostada, with avocados and sour cream. Again, they were good. Just not OMG-this-is-phenomenal-over-the-top good (like say a Taco Mesa or Caliente in Costa Mesa, or Pinches Tacos in L.A.).  I feel like the yelpers here have overrated this place. I would have been ok if the tab came out to around $12; $18 is a little over the top for what it was. I think I could cook up something comparable in my own kitchen.",

    "text": "Those of you from Southern California know what I mean when we start talking about amazing Mexican food. You can't really get that here especially from the SW Vegas. Now I have heard that north Vegas has some good Mexican food but who really wants to travel that far? Los Tacos is my to go place when I get tacos al pastor. For all al pastor fans must understand this isn't the traditional al pastor on the stick slowly roasting with the flavorings slowly dripping down. It's just the stove top grilling with small pieces of pineapples.  Service is good. Now do expect a bit of a wait at the drive thru. This is not Taco Bell or Del Taco. The wait just means that my food is just that much fresher. Don't even think about going to Robert's or some other place. Just head to Los Tacos if you're in the SW.",

    "text": "Don't just drive past this place! Yes, it looks like your average fast-food-joint-converted-into-Mexican-taco-stand. From the outside.  Go in and you are first greeted by the staff who smile and say hi as they bustle through their food prep (they're also filling drive-thru orders). And you look around--the place has charm. They've put in their own furniture--kind of modified benches/tables that feel like a comfier upgraded fast food set-up. There's some decor, the place has a feel, maybe even some plants. Your senses tell you this is NOT just a taco joint or fast food.  And take a look into the kitchen, which is all open for you to check out. It's shiny, clean and fresh-looking. You're excited about what will come out of there.  I had told my friends that, according to Yelp, the tacos were huge. The guy behind the counter was fixing one up. He saw us staring and held it up for us. He saw the awe in our faces. He smiled and said, 'Half pound of meat.\"   We got a variety of tacos in our party  (each of us only needed one). It comes half wrapped in paper like an In&Out burger, and it's good that it does. It's thick and full of juicy stuff piling out the back. I chose the carne asada--pretty awesome. My friends liked the agua frescas, too.  I wish I had a taco joint like this near where I live. I'd make it my regular go-to. The food is lightning fast, but I'd even be tempted to hang out a little.",

    "text": "Came here after a good game of golf (actually it wasn't so good for me, but that's another story):  Pros:   * Really clean interior / dining area   * Incredibly tasty Shrimp Tostadas   * they have Agua de Frescas!   * clean restrooms (one person at a time)  Cons:   * The Agua de Fresca wasn't too refreshing.   * Salsa was mediocre    Tips:   * If you are looking for silverware (or in this case it would be plasticware), it's to the back of the restaurant (assuming you are at the cashier's and facing the cashier register)   *  The bathroom has a padlock, but they always leave it unlocked  I'm big on tacos and I must say, I'm a fan of Los Tacos.  They have some really good Tostadas and they have a pretty good selection of meet, including some of my favs:  Lengua (Tongue) and Cabeza ( Beef's Head). Aside from Tostadas and the typical burritos/tacos, they also have Tortas.  The portions are pretty good and the price isn't the greatest, but it is far from being an expensive eat.  The tacos are overstuffed and looked amazing (my cousin ordered one).  The burritos were long and thinner than say a burrito at Roberto's, but the taste packed a punch for sure!  They have green salsa at every table (except the one I sat at.. ha, I had to snatch one off of a vacant table by mine), but it's far from being spicy.  Thank god my burrito came with a few chiles.  For a typical taco joint, I must say they take more time to assure they have a nice little presentation.  Sure the burrito was wrapped in foil, but next to it in the plastic basket lined with white paper was a small edible garnishment constructed of a few crunchy tortilla chips and a house salsa concoction.  The salsa itself had a weird taste, but nonetheless, I thought it was nice to see Los Tacos takes time to up the ante when it comes to presentation.  The Agua de Fresca here was not up to par in my opinion.  I'm a big fan of Melon (cantelope), which they had; but it was way too think.  I'll stick to Cardena's for my Melon fix.  Overall, they place was pretty good and I could definitely see myself coming again.  I came hungry and left full and satisfied.  Misison accomplished!",

Since I'm still fairly new to this city I like trying different places, finding suitable replacements for my old stomping grounds in LA.  Anyhow this place looked like it was fairly new the bunch of men behind the counter looked like they were still working on fine tuning the registers. The cashier seemed nervous and distracted.  Needless to say she got my order wrong, when confronted didn't apologize or offer to correct it. The gentle man behind the counter stepped in and quickly apologized and offered to let me have the incorrect item as a comp. Okay problem fixed no worries right? Wrong...  the cook threw it away but no worries I didn't care the gesture was all that matters. And that wasn't the only problem upon a close look at the receipt we discovered we were charged for every additional topping so our three dollar taco was more like five dollars and our five dollar burrito was closer to eight dollars and there was the wait.... over 20 minutes with only one person ahead of us. But I do have to say the food was good so flavorful and authentic .The food deserves five stars but unfortunately service matters to me when I rate a restaurant. I will be back for the food but I really hope they work on thier customer service, clear up the pricing and ticket times...this is a FAST food restaurant after all.",

I'm not a big meat eater but their carne asada is delicious and moist. They offer plenty of agua fresca flavors  which pairs well with their food. Service is always friendly and efficient. As expected, it can get crowded during lunch hours but I think it's worth it. Unfortunately, all their locations are in the north end of the valley. The complete opposite of where I live. Ugh.

We have had all sorts of tacos in many different places (cities, states, etc.) and my bf and I STILL cannot find a place that beats Los Tacos. It's literally mind-boggling how good they are. Their service is another aspect of this place that we love. It's always so genuine and I swear, there has been a handful of times where we have gotten something for free. Be it free chips and salsa, free \"extra quesadilla they accidentally made\" or free taco that they feel like they need to give us because they made us wait a whole four minutes for our order in the drive through. All of the out of town folk that we have taken to this place are all literally floored and they come from places that are heavily populated with awesome Mexican-fare, so you know this place is DELICIOUS!",

How hard is it to assemble carne asada, avocado, light pico and cheese together without the tortilla in one of those little paper bowls they serve pico in? Too bad as their food is good.

Los Tacos has been an institution in my family for as long as I can remember. Carne asada tacos for everyone!! Not that I'm hating on the chicken, carnitas or lengua... but the carne asada is just so DARN GOOD.   Truth be told, you're cheating yourself if you haven't experienced Los Tacos. Stop reading this review and just go! Go to Taco Heaven and experience the euphoria. Then come back & thank me.   P.S. The green hot sauce on the table has super powers and you'll end up wanting to steal the whole bottle... brace yourself.",

Opperating costs are huge.  The extra few bucks, in Los Tacos case, for me, is justified by knowing that I am going to leave happy everytime. Having  go-to spot feels good.",

The food wasn't amazing, but I'd eat here in a pinch, without a complaint. Maybe a whine, pretentious and mewling, but not a full on complaint.   Yelp in LV isn't like in the bay area or the northwest. Peops are so happy to not be lambasted and bombarded by the commercialization around the strip, that anything prepared by actual people instead of employees filling a role seems amazing. My first inclination was that this was a great find - a cheap 4 star joint. Upon returning home though, I realized that this place wouldn't really work if there was anything better around.   Las Vegas has cool people living there - so friendly! So earnest! -  they deserve cool spots that are local, delicious, and inspired.",

Right now, I am so fucking full, that I have no choice but to write this review with a full stomach, and a happy heart.  My coworker suggested this place for our Work Family Dinner, and we all obliged.  From the outside, it looks like your typical hole in the wall Mexican/Taco joint, but when you walk in, you are surrounded by a clean habitat for the most bomb-ass Mexican food ever.  I ordered one taco (cabeza...brain for you weaklings), and one quesadilla (chicken). Both were perfect.  The taco, perfectly cooked on fresh tortillas, surrounded by onions, and guac. The quesadilla was PERFECT!! Chicken that melted off the fork, and so much flavor, it was as if the chicken was born in the sauce and spices it was cooked in.  Will I come back? Hell yes. Will I feel bad about it later? Probably, but who cares. YOLO. hahaha   Hint...be adventurous, and not a food wuss. Don't ask for things \"healthy\" or say eww just because the menu items have cabeza, buche or lengua. Man up, and be the adventurous person you claim you are. Otherwise....you are a poser.

The seafood \"Coctel\" was awesome - I wish I would have ordered a double! My 2 year old ate a whole plate of rice and beans.  Their beans are simple and delicious. My wife had us go back the next day for their Strawberry Horchata! Price is definitely fair - the tacos are BIG.  We went their for the first time on Monday and have been back 2x's since.

I consider places like Mickey D's and B-king to be fast food and the main reason is because most of their \"food\" is mechanically processed and frozen... and that's the definition of fast [unhealthy] food.  LT on the other hand does have a drive-thur but they are not fast and their food in my experience has always been very fresh. I usually get 2 chicken tacos that come in a corn tortilla which includes beans and I add avocado and skip the cheese. This little meal is about $7 and you can't go wrong with that.  I ordered this yesterday and I still had a 10 minute drive home and was wowed at the fact that when I got home my meal was still hot enough that I didn't need to reheat... Yay!  In a nutshell I like this LT location because they are faster than the one on Charleston near bruce and they've never miss up on my order. Hooray for Los Tacos all the way around!",

She had the large Cocktail and Aqua Sandia. She said it was the BEST she has ever had. I must say both tacos were great but I did like the pastor the most. The cashier was correct in saying that 2 tacos are huge. We had chips and salsa, just have to order it, $2.00. They also have salsa, pico and fab guac!

The thing is absolutely massive.  We also ordered a side of rice and beans (and an al pastor taco for my fiance).  We had MORE THAN ENOUGH, and every bit of it was delicious.

    "text": "I stopped in for lunch and the place was filled with white, car-salesman-looking guys. That should tell you something right there. The food itself isn't that bad (at least some of it), but it's pricey. $3.00 for a taco. If you want sour cream or guacamole that's going to cost you extra.   I ordered one carne asada taco, one al pastor taco, a cheese quesadilla, and a pineapple fruit drink. I tend to like my food on the mild side, so when I think something is bland, that means it's totally devoid of flavor. That was the case with their carne asada. It was hardly seasoned, if at all. The al pastor was much better. Tender pieces of pork with a little bit of a kick to them. Both tacos were large and overflowing w/ meat, onions and cilantro. Definitely enough to fill an average person up.  For the quesadilla you have the option of either a corn tortilla or flour tortilla. I went with the flour and the outside of it was perfectly crispy and flaky.  The pineapple drink was delicious as well.  It was $11.46 for the lunch, which seems incredibly expensive considering I could eat across the street at Los Parados for cheaper and get better food.   On the bright side, Los Tacos is very clean and has a drive thru.",

Orange grease running everywhere, and while it was cut in half, the second half was, like, too much of the same thing. Probably better to share - was just too much grease. Had a hard time getting a spot of their red hot sauce (there is no salsa bar). Girl behind the counter kept pointing to the bottle of Tapatio. I said, \"No, don't you have some homemade red sauce?\" She said, \"Red Sauce?\" and pointed again at Tapatio. Sheesh. Finally after five times, she got it. Ohhh, red sauce. Oy, it wasn't worth the fight. Roberto's is so much better.    The most annoying part was there were so many flies in the joint - was fighting them off the entire meal. Then some crazy yelling-screaming-rap tune came on, of course, insanely loud, and I was just like, ok, this is totally sucking right now. I guess other people complained 'bout the music because after a few minutes, the manager killed it.  Los Tacos, done. Can cross it off the list now, doubt I'll be back. Flies...grease... ick.",

Anyway, Daniel (manager/owner) provided amazing service once again by being very friendly, providing meat samples, giving advice, and giving us a free small cup of shrimp cocktail! I found out on this visit that this is a family business and the Daniel's dad started the business in SF. The location in SF is called La Taqueria. SF is 8 hours away though, Vegas is 4 hours so this is still my closest location. But I still want to plan an SF trip since I haven't been there, now I have more reasons to go. Fingers still crossed a location in LA will happen one day! Anxious to go to here again and it's only been three days since my last visit....",

All of the food we bought were really good.

This location is a great size especially since it's always busy but they make your food really fast so that's a plus! The only reason I didn't make this 5 stars was because they don't tell you it's extra to add \"everything\" or \"con todo.\" It would be nice if they let you know that each taco \"with everything\" is going to cost you almost an extra $2 per taco. I didn't see it advertised anywhere. Our order of 5 tacos went up almost $10 because we got it \"with everything.\" Also the times we have gone to get food the staff isn't very friendly and I never get a smile from them.

You don't realize it until you go to pay. I asked for salsa and at the drive through they didn't get that. Was that extra ? I drove off after dealing with them on the loudspeaker outdoor menu. It's a game and I won't eat here because of that. Every time I have to go and pay its 40-50 dls because they nailed me for so the extras. Don't care for it. There are other options.",

No fat, cartilage, nothing chewy - just good, easy to eat, on point carne.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The rest of the taco was fine and I especially liked the big glob of mashed avocado tucked into the tortilla.  The quesadilla was cheesy, a bit crispy, all together very yum.  The green sauce mentioned in other reviews was a bit hot for me so I used it sparingly.  My co-worker, by comparison, took a bath in it.  I'd definitely go back to Los Tacos.",

    "text": "My coworker and I were returning from the east side of town at lunch time and we're trying to decide where to eat. When we saw the Los Tacos sign, I remember when this place was a Weinerschnitzel. Since I hadn't been there, it would give me something to yelp about.  I had a carne asada burrito. Most of the places have packages of chopped beef they throw on the griddle to cook it, this meat had charring on it and tasted like charbroiled steak, this burrito was delicious, very good.   There were a few beans in the burrito, but not many, they certainly weren't using beans as filler, like so many places have decided to do. Some places put so much rice and beans in the burritos, the meat gets lost. I prefer a meat burrito, just meat with cheese, guacamole or salsa, with rice and beans on the side.  The size was medium, not too big, not too small. Some places make things larger, because some people equate quantity to value. A lot of mediocre, is still mediocre. I suppose it depends on why you're eating. If you're taking a break, to relax and enjoy the food, quality means more. If you don't know when you'll have your next meal, your primary goal is to store calories, then quantity would mean more.  If you like the carne asada burritos at Roberto's (which I do), you'll love the carne asada burritos at Los Tacos.   I will definitely go there again and recommend it to anyone.",

Having established my credentials as such, I have to say I was highly disappointed by Los Tacos.    The visit started so well.  The staff was friendly and I love being able to see them make the food right in front of you.  From there it started to slide. I saw on the board they had tacos, burritos etc...standard taco shop fare.  Then next to it they have their different type of meats.  I saw tacos were $3.00 so I assumed that covered any type of meat so I ordered two with a soda.  The gal asked if I wanted everything on them and I said sure and then she said that'll be $11.64.  I did a double take on a scale that hasnt been seen since Cousin Larry on the 1980's show \"Perfect Strangers.\"  I asked how it could be that much if tacos were $3.00 and she replied if you get them with everything it becomes close to $5.00.  I downgraded my order to one thinking this must be a pretty big taco for $5.00.    Well the taco came and needless to say I haven't been this disappointed in size since Pam Anderson had her latest surgery.  I couldnt believe the size to cost, and the additional surcharge for the privilege of guacamole, sour cream and cheese.  The overall taco (I got the al pastor marinated pork) tasted just ok, but certainly it was nothing to write home about.    There is so much taco greatness in the world, it'll be hard to get me to come back here.  I mean I will eventually because I always feel a place is worth a second shot and it wasnt terrible, just disappointing (isn't that what my dad said to me when he was made at me as a kid?).  Back onto my business class seat on the taco train....",

I am starting to realize that many restaurants out here in Las Vegas -do not. That being said- the carne asada burrito I put down yesterday was pretty close to perfect. The steak itself was cooked perfectly and was so freakin' flavorful. I was pleasantly surprised to see whole pinto beans inside of my burrito instead of standard re fried beans. The green salsa was OK- not great. In my opinion, spending $9.24 on a burrito and a drink was a few dollars too much. I like the fact that this place offers a drive thru, and will come back to try some other menu items. Bottom line, this place is a solid choice for fast authentic Mexican food despite being a little pricey.",

Their homemade hot sauce is killer and perhaps the best in town.  You must ask for it at the counter.  It's not too spicy, but wonderfully flavorful.  Honestly, we've eaten here about 25 times and have not strayed from our favorite, carne asada tacos.  One taco is pretty large with double corn tortilla.  Two tacos will leave you feeling full and needing a nap!  The side order of rice and beans is good as well.  You can not go wrong with this place.  A must eat for any taco lover.",

    "text": "Why haven't I tried this place sooner! One day I had a craving for elote (Mexican style corn) and I thought this place would have it.  My BF and I went thru the drive thru and they unfortunately didn't have it but, the owner of the place asked if I had eaten there before. I responded that I hadn't and he gave me this delicious mango drink and told me if I came back he would treat us to lunch. I mean, who does that? He is the reason I returned just to see what the place was about.   We returned and ordered Carne asada nachos, a buche taco, lengua tacos, a pastor taco, watermelon juice, and mango juice.  I don't recall seeing the Carne asada nachos on the menu but when we asked, the same gentleman told us he could make it. Everything was fricken delicious!   We eat lengua tacos a lot and this has to be the best hands down. The reason is because they cook two batches a day to keep it fresh. At other taco places the meat sits there all day and night (eh hem Tacos Mexico), and soaks up the oil and just gets old. At Los Tacos, It just tastes so much cleaner without all that old grease and doesn't even need sauce.   The Carne asada nachos had guacamole and salsa piled high and we finished every bite.  It was so good, the owner noticed I was dancing in my seat while eating (I didn't realize I was doing that)   Love this place! And it's so close to home... The people that work here are amazing which makes it even better than 5 stars.",

Then you're like... okay it's Vegas, of course it'll cost a little more, whatever. 5 minutes later, you get your food and it tastes like nothing. Nothing.  I'm from LA so I have decent expectations for Mexican food and this was almost disrespectful. No flavor and the meat was cold. The watermelon drink was good.  Bottom line: this place is one very small step above Taco Bell. If you're from LA or SD, any taco truck you might go to is better than this.",

The lines were super long which was a good sign (Except that we had to wait a minute). But it was fine because the steak aroma that filled this dining establishment was enticing. I ordered a carne asada taco combo that came with two tacos and rice and beans.  I also added on some chips and salsa. The tacos were filled to the brim with delectable carne asada, guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, and cheese. My friend had a shrimp tostada that surpassed her anticipations. While it was super busy, the employees did an excellent job preparing food. They also have a drive thru for future convenience.

    "text": "First, if you still eat at Taco Bell, I strongly encourage you to please stop.  Go here instead!  Really!  Your couple bucks are better spent on a taco at Los Tacos.  Their food is real stuff!  Thanks to bff Elaine, this was her addiction on the way to her old work.  I know I've been her friend since forever.  I would never discourage her away from this addiction.  I can see why she can't stay away.  What's super neat and handy is how they wrap their tacos like a handle to allow for easy consumption.  Also, how much love is in one taco.  They're not flat tacos okay.  Mmmm with added avocado and Pico de Gallo - a must!  Burritos too are no joke.  What in the world was I thinking trying to have a burrito and taco?!  That's called force feeding thy self cuz of the overactive hunger hormone ghrelin.  If we could only lock ghrelin in a box...  So between horchata and jamaica, which would you pick?  Their jamaica was actually good and not too sour.  I think I should suggest they serve tequila shots in them though; optional of course!",

We got 3 burritos asada and 1 lengua or tongue. And some fresh aguas de horchata. We got a cantaloupe one but we took it back way to sweet. The avocados are cut while you wait it doesn't get fresher then this. Prices are a lil above average tacos BUT it's worth it. Tacos are loaded! Definitely a must! This place definitely will have a faithful customer!",

Those people paid 2 bucks more for the add on bringing a taco to 5 bucks. Yes five bucks is not that much for food but I'm use to delicious dollar tacos!!  Granted these were slightly bigger than normal street tacos, they still aren't worth it to me. And this place puts beans on their street tacos. Maybe it's to make the taco look even bigger. And if you ask can I have the beans on the side cause I don't know if I will like it or not... They said they will charge you for a side of beans.....   This place has NO salsa bar, no condiment bar, not even a lime!  I tried the carne asada, which is not great, the al pastor, better with more flavor and my friend's lengua. The lengua was nice and tender but my favorite is still the al pastor.  They also only have flour tortillas.   Will not be coming to this place ever again.",

When they say carne asada it acutally is asada, grilled over a real fire and not a flat top.   Order their tacos with the works, yes its a little pricey at $3.50 per taco but this is the way to go.  Its two full size tortillas with cheese in the middle that they warm up on the flat grill until the cheese melts and they then fill it with whole beans your choice of meat topped with real guacamole and sour cream  1-2 tacos are normally enough and I usually enjoy their asada or lengua or both :).   Also enjoy their agua frescas made with real ingredients and in the summer their incredibly good seafood cocktails!",

Right... so I get my food, I double check it and they still forgot half the order but didn't charge me for it! I had to pay even more than what I thought I was already having to pay which was already a stupid price. I finally get home after being hangry eat the now soggy food because I had to wait for the part of it. I look at the receipt and realize they charged me for the burritos not the tacos. My order should have cost me $22 and some change. The charged me $38 in total. So not only is my food soggy and cold, not only did they get my order wrong, they over charged me!! I am not happy about the customer service or the food. Not to mention the girl at the window was holding my bag and couldn't figure out what to do next...you open the window and you hand it to me.

It doesn't really specify what comes with burritos, tacos, etc.  I added guacamole, sour cream, and cheese to my Al Pastor burrito.  Absolute heaven!  Even better with the sauce on the tables.  Chips and salsa were about average.  Nothing special there, but that's not the focus in this place.   I'm going back for Tacos later this week!    Thanks for the great meal Los Tacos!",

The very unfriendly worker asked me if I wanted it with everything and I of course said yes not knowing that it was three dollars more for sour cream and cheese on my tacos. The staff is very rude there and horrible to deal with.  The pastor is very good and does not need to be drenched in sour cream so I would  like to try it again on its own, but the carne A is horrible, just flap meat grilled and chopped with no seasoning, not even salt. Not good, not good!",

I've only had the tacos and I've had beef and chicken. I'll probably get the pork next to try it. I get it with everything, sour cream, salsa, and cheese, for and extra $1.50. Making it almost a $5.00 taco! But it's worth it and way better then any $10.00 fast food meal! The only other food I've tried are the chips and salsa and they are pretty average. The BF gets a carne asada burrito with everything and it's amazing as well.   I get the Strawberry Drink, it's awesome! Nice and refreshing!   Try this place you won't be disappointed! Be ready to order they move fast and you can feel pressured to order before you you really decided what you wanted!",

Who eats tacos, with beans in their tacos?! Eww!! Don't waste your time, we wasted 30 minutes of our precious time, just to get a refund. Plus the tacos are small and they add the beans to make them look decent for 3.50! Not even King tacos are that expensive! Eww!!!",

    "text": "Now, this was a pleasant surprise!  I've driven by this taco place a thousand times and never once did I think I would try them.  \"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One of them places\", I told myself when I saw it the first time.    Rewind few months back:  A friend mentioned about going on a social lunch at Los Tacos on Charleston but it never materialized.  There was never a follow up so it died a natural death.  Forward to July 11, 2014:  I forgot my lunch at home so I had to eat out.  I didn't have breakfast so I was beyond starvation and  I decided to hit  the very first restaurant or fastfood I would see on my way out, good or bad, costly or cheap.  As I was heading towards Sahara from CSN on Las Verdes, the blue Los Tacos sign was so bright and vibrant in the Las Vegas sun and was the first food place I saw.   I walked in to a packed and somewhat loud restaurant with the aroma of the grilled meat welcoming me in.  There was a long line of people waiting to order, and waiting for their orders.  As I stood in line, I was trying to figure out how to order and what to order.  The people ahead of me looked like they're all returning customers because the line moved so fast and the people knew what to get while I was still looking around, like a  True green neophyte, and checking out what the people who were already seated were eating.  Before I knew it, I was in front of the cashier who greeted me with a friendly smile.  He handed me small servings of lengua and red sauce for me to try and me liked it.  I ordered a lengua taco and carne asada taco sin frijoles.  I don't know if it was the missed breakfast and starvation, but boy, they were good.  So, I went back in line and ordered Al Pastor Burrito and salsa/chips.  Suffice to say, they satisfied me to a T, and I was a happy camper.    The lengua was seasoned and cooked just right and didn't have that weird \"it's not really meat\" aftertaste.  It was proportionately topped with chopped cebollas and cilantro.  And with their homemade salsa verde, it sure was a winner!    Granted the price here is a bit higher than most, if not all, taco places BUT darn, its all worth it.  I've tried Tacos El Gordo when it was still on the strip.  They're cheaper (but not by much) and very good too but their servings would make you cry and scream at the men behind their counter for more.  I could easily chow down 6 El Gordo tacos even if i wasn't hungry, and still looked famish.  So, if you do the \"serving portion to cost\" ratio, it will end up pretty much the same, except Los Tacos will fill (and satisfy) you.  'nuff said.    Disclaimer:  My review was not, in any way, shape or form, influenced by the free shirt given to me by the cashier.  I swear!",

    "text": "I could have sworn I had already written a review for this place.  Maybe I was too busy eating and it slipped my mind.  I absolutely love the carne asada tortas here!  So savory and delicious.  I keep it neatly wrapped up so it doesn't fall apart; don't want to lose any of the goodness.  I always go in so I can sit and eat; no patience to take it to go.  I haven't had anything else from here because when I do visit, I always get the same delicious carne asada torta.  The place is a renovated building (I think it used to be a Weinershnitzel).  The place is hopping during lunch time, so if you can either get there before or after the rush the wait shouldn't be too long.  Service has been consistently friendly and efficient.  You place your order at the counter, get your beverage and receipt, then go sit and listen for when your number is called.  It looks and feels like a fast food restaurant because of them taking over and renovating a building designed for that, but the food tastes authentic and healthy if compared to traditional fast food fare.",

The workers look like they know what there doing, and the food was given to us fairly quick, even though when they call out the food it's kinda hard to understand them. But there food is good we just got rice and beans, chips and salsa, carne asada torta, al pastor torta and a carne asada quesadilla. We did ask for our tortas to be extra toasted because if not they will get soggy and they sorted toasted them but not much so my last couple bites of the torta were falling apart. Over all I like this place and do recommend it to anyone!",

They were a little busier than they were last time, for some reason the same thing I ordered last time I went, 2 weekends ago was $2 higher today than it was 2 Saturdays ago....Mabye prices Vary....a AND they forgot to make my food! They made my husband and 2 kids food... and forgot to make mine! When my husband went to ask the girl who took our order about my nachos, she quickly got at offended/or copped an attitude and said \"they making it\" so...10 mins went by, the restaurant has cleared out and I still had no food! So I go up there and say\" clearly ya'll forgot to make my food, how much longer us it going to be?\" They tell me....\" no forget!! We make-it right now\" they throw some nachos on a plate and had them to me. They get get real salty when I tell them that it was to-go. So then the girl who took the order comes over and say \"Oh it's to go now?\" I said it's been to go! You thought I was gone make my husband and kids wait to eat because they forgot to make my food? Just because you saw us...well them sitting down to eat don't mean our orders were to dine-in so, the made the order to do, and I went to the table and finally 20 mins later... I was about to eat... or so I thought!!! I was so disappointed and pissed off when I saw the hand full of dried up meat that was on those nachos...not only did they forget to make my food....I had to wait 20 mins for them to make it... after asking about it they got the nerve to get an attitude, knowing dam well they forgot...and on top of all that paying the \"Sunday price\" they gave me that crap....smh NEVER AGAIN!",

They're not like your usual tacos that you need like 8 of them to get filled up, here you're good with just one or two.   Their quesadillas are amazing though. There's a semi-thin layer of cheese and it's cooked on a flat top so it is extra crispy. And every table has a bottle of green salsa, which is not too spicy, but if you do want spicy you can just ask for it at the counter.  Other items on the menu include burritos, tortas, sopes, and much more. And of course can't forget your jamaica, horchata, and tamarindo",

    "text": "My co-workers and I did a less formal version of a \"battle of the tacos\" between Los Tacos and Tacos el Gordo.  Here's the basic run down:  The tacos are bigger here and they cost more that Tacos el Gordo too. At $3.00 a taco WITHOUT the works on it. To have all the extra add ons it would be an additional $2 each. Here, I only had to purchase 2 tacos versus 4 at Tacos el Gordo (which ultimately comes out the same anyway). I don't know what kind of tortilla TeG uses, but I was disappointed to see that LT doesn't make their tacos. It was definitely store bought.  The taco breakdown:  LENGUA: I do like the lengua here. A lot \"saltier\" and \"full of flavor\" than TeG. You also get a bigger portion too. I personally like the lengua here more.  AL PASTOR: Also very good (i guess comparable to the ADOBADO i tried in TeG, but only because their both marinated pork). Super good, tender pork, and bold with a slightly sweet taste to it.   Definitely a good off the strip location to go to if Tacos el Gordo is too overwhelming for you since it is on he strip and they have lines on top of lines.  My co-worker got a TORTA, and if you're wondering what that is, it's basically a sandwich version of everything else in a toasted fresh-like roll. It looks pretty good! If you are looking for something less messy and complicated other than a burrito...I'd say go for it. I've never tried this version before, and I'd like to come back to experience it.",

Being the yellow that I am I yelped, then called to make sure that Los tacos was opened. I then drove here and pulled up in their drive thru. Daniel the owner asked me to pull up so he could help me since it was my 1st time here. I pulled up and asked for tacos. Not only did he give 4 different meat samples to me and my boyfriend, he gave us like 6 agua frescas samples. My heart was set on the Mango pineapple... We were provided the best customer service ever, and he even have me the address to his dad restaurant in San FranciscoI can't wait to try it when I vacation out there in a couple of months... This place is the best.. I'll be back everytime I'm in Vegas... Thanks Daniel",

I also ordered the mango agua fresca and I though it was pretty good considering that It was only 2 bucks for real fruit! The only bad thing is that they were pretty busy at lunch time so we had to wait a while, on top of that they forgot to make my bfs order so we had to wait even longer .. Overall a good Mexican food in a clean and pleasant restaurant!",

We got our usual go-to's: two bean and cheese burritos and a large horchata to share. Everything was what we expected and really hit the spot.

The tacos are about $3.50 each. And it turns out to add the toppings it's an additional $1.85 per taco. You're looking at a $6 taco here.  Got the usual carne, my comparison standard, along with the chorizo taco. I wasn't a fan of their chorizo at all. The carne Assad's was okay, with some pieces being charred and juicy, while the remainder was dry.   The tacos are huge. Corn tortilla is bomb. But I'm not a fan of paying $6 for a drive-through taco. The shrimp cocktails are most popular, but wow, it's nearly $15 or more. That's a dine-in price point.   I've had better for $2.50 a taco at the trucks that come with juicy, flavorful meats.",

Their verde sauce added a bit more flavor into an already flavorful bite. Everything about the food was just oh so delicious. Also ordered their pina, which was super sweet. Not sure if I liked it or not, cause I couldn't tell if it was from the actual pineapples or if they added a ton of sugar.

Upon arrival, one of my friends was drooling over her chunky, well-seasoned shrimp cocktail, and others in our group slowly demolished their stuffed burritos. Meanwhile, I had finished my two corn quesadillas (see photo - that is TWO quesadilla orders) within five minutes. For $2 each, they weren't awful, but they definitely weren't the best (or biggest) I've ever had. Perhaps I'll return with my lunch crew someday and give Los Tacos a chance to redeem themselves to me - but I certainly won't be making a repeat order.",

The space is comfortable, air-conditioned with benches and a pretty outdoor patio with \"bar chairs\".  There are 2 TVs showing Mexican channels.  Their tacos are about 1-2 dollars more than Tacos El Gordo (depending if you want the works) but man... are they worth it!!!    Hubby had the carne asada plate which comes with beans, rice, tortillas, and vegetables.  He was happy with this, it was a substantial piece of meat, but I do wish it had more oil.  The salsa was good, as well as their nacho chips., then I had their shrimp tostada with avocado ($4.00) but man oh man it was soooo good!  And very filling.  I also tried their Al Pastor and Lengua tacos.  The Al Pastor meat is not as heavily seasoned as I'm accustomed too in other taco shops, and they serve their version with beans.  This was ok.  But the lengua taco.. that was mind blowing!!!  It had HUGE chunks of extremely tender and savory lengua (beef tongue) that is prepared and cooked well because it does not have a very strong gamey taste/smell like in other taco joints.   If you have not tried beef tongue, this is the perfect introduction for you.  The owner said they make the lengua batch fresh every day and never serve leftovers.  I'm remembering that lengua and forgetting my husband again.  Hehe.  Can't wait to go back!!!",

Though I've had larger and meatier burritos this one hit the spot and came out in less than a minute to boot.  Meat was lean and the extras were very fresh.  Next time I go back I'll maybe try the shrimp.  Pros:  amiable staff (and cute cook) and fresh well made food. Cons:  none really, except the burrito size.  Oh, and $2 for chips.",

After reading about this place recently from other Yelpers and its not too far away I decided to try it out. Inside a remodeled Wienerschnitzel it has cleaned up nicely and my order didn't take too long. I ordered a carne asada and a carnitas taco and apparently ordered it with all the toppings that includes pinto beans,guacamole, sour cream, cheese and pico.  Which was a shame cause the guacamole and sour cream covered up all the taste and the beans were the runny kind but were seasoned well. So each one cost about $5 bucks apiece in which i think is too much but it is a large taco, but I would rather have the smaller \"Street\" style tacos. Keep it simple and flavorful, next time no extras for me.",

The Carne Asada Taco has an incredible flavor...one that I have never tasted before and the shrimp cocktail in a beer mug was sweet, spicy and flavorful.  Their fruit waters (strawberry, cantaloupe, mango and pineapple), are also the perfect touch to this menu (although I could have enjoyed a good sangrais or mojito!).

Initially, I wasn't sure about beans on my taco, but I thought I would try it the way they make it and then decide. Suprisingly, I like the beans.  And the Carne Asada? Most delicious I've ever had. Ever. I found myself tempted to drive back for dinner later that day, if it wasn't so far I may have actually done it.  I've been back two or three times since, each time just as good. On my second trip, I tried the Quesadilla Harina con Carne Asada, which was also very good. Reminds me a lot of these Quesa Tacos I had from a street stand in Mexico.",

I'm a fan.\"  My boyfriend's co worker was the one that recommended this place so on a late, lazy afternoon we decide to go and try it out.  The cashier was friendly and her customer service was amazing. We were pretty picky on what we want/didn't want on our tacos and she accomadated our order without acting like we were a bother to her. Menu was small and simple which was not a problem at all. You got your tacos, burritos, quesadillas, spanish rice, chips and salsa, nachos, and seafood plates.  My boyfriend and I got 3 carne asada  tacos, a side of chips and salsa and two drinks. Our total came out to be about $17. Kinda pricey for just tacos, small basket of chips and drinks.  Although the tacos were DELISH!!!! It looked like a gourmet taco with all the fixins'. You can choose to have beans, sour cream, avocados or cheese. The carne asada meat....let me tell you: the way its marinated and cooked, it reminded me of my Cali summertime BBQs at a mexican family get-together. (i know im not mexican but i've been invited to my mexican friends family get-togethers wayyy back in the days okay!?) The meat tasted fresh, there weren't any fat and it wasn't dried either. I didn't even need to put any lemon or salsa because it was packed with yummy goodness like my favorite: gucamole.  We will definitely be coming back to this place.",

Tacos are massive and include meat, but any additional toppings are extra. The tacos are $3.50 base price, so if you add any toppings you're looking at $5 for a taco! Burritos are $6 and include meat, rice and beans, but additional toppings are also extra. I spent $23 on nachos, a carne asada burrito, a quesadilla and a medium drink.  We ordered al pastor nachos- which aren't on the menu. Now that I am looking at the menu again, I realize nachos are not on there at all, so ask for them. They were pretty damn good. The tortilla chips were a touch too salty, but not a deal breaker. They were fried fresh so they were still hot. The nachos had a generous amount of meat, cheese, guacamole and grilled onions, as well as sour cream and pico on the side per our request. It was only $10 and was enough for 3 of us to share. The burrito was good, but nothing to write home about. I added some salsa that was on the table and it kicked it up a notch. My friend got a cheese quesadilla for $2 and it looked pretty good, but he was still hungry afterwards. I would come back for the nachos, but I think I will stick to other less expensive places for my taco fix.  Note- They are open 10-10 7 days a week. A bit surprising they aren't open until later, especially on weekends.",

Ordered through the drive thru, got my food, glanced in the bag and saw a spoon I was good to go.   Pulled out and on my way when I realized I didn't ask for Tapatio! DOH! *palm to face* When I got to my destination, I saw a nicely wrapped half lime, bag with chips (did NOT skimp on the chips!) and crackers, plenty of napkins, spoon..... AND a container FULL of Tapatio!!! OMG I was so happy I had to write a review. Lady at the drive thru was very nice as well and my coctel was heavenly!",

    "text": "Maybe the trick here is not to use the drive-thru. I thought it would be wildly convenient, but it took 15 minutes to get my simple order, without apology or explanation. Menu is straight forward: tacos and burritos with all of the expected meats, small seafood selection and some quesadillas, and that's about it.   Staff may or may not speak English so bust out your best high school Spanish. While you wait in the drive-thru, enjoy watching the staff make their own meals or snacks and eat them, then return to work without using gloves or washing their hands. As you wait for your own order, forgotten by the cashier.  Lengua junior burrito is well-sized but literally consists of just lengua and cheese. Probably a better option than ordering several separate tacos, if you're going to get them with all the same meat. The lengua itself was soft and flavorful and delicious, but the taste got boring after half of the burrito. Alas, I had not been given any salsas, dios mio!  Ceviche tostadas is two crispy shells and a small-looking portion of fish in a Styrofoam cup with avocado slices. Fish was fresh and had good flavor- simply seasoned with sal, pepino, y limon, but it really worked, especially with the creaminess of the avocado.",

First instance was a week ago when I ordered a fish burrito and a shrimp taco like I've always done. As they gave me the food I asked for a plastic bag and when she went to give me bag my fish burrito fell onto the floor in the drive thru. So they said oh we'll replace that no problem. She comes back and tells me that they don't have any more fish for the night and that they can instead make me something else I told her I am a Pescatarian and I don't eat meat, seafood only. So she says how about a shrimp burrito and I said that's too much shrimp more then I would want in one meal and she says hold on. They give the food and tell me here you go don't worry about it. I didn't that much shrimp but she didn't get the hint that I wanted a refund for the burrito. So I go home and did not enjoy that much shrimp in one meal. Strike one. The second time something happened was today when I ordered the same thing again. I usually like this place so I had high hopes that a communication error was a one time thing. So I ordered the usual \"fish burrito, shrimp taco\" at this point the lady at the window tells me \"beef taco?\" I said no it's camarron. And she says oh ok camarron. Then I tell her FISH burrito. She says \"steak burrito?\" I replied, \"NO, FISH burrito FISH!\" She then says ok. I pay for the food, drive all the way home and what do I get a nice fat bite into a beef burrito. I spit my food out and called right away. The lady remembers me and tells me to come back in tonmorow because they're closed. I don't even have an appetite anymore and I'm honestly pissed Im dealing with this. I did not get full off of one shrimp taco and I threw the rest of the  beef burrito in the fridge so I can waste my gas to come back and show them I didn't eat it so they will give me a refund. I like the food here usually but atleast hire people who can understand orders so your brand image won't get tarnished. I love the food it's delicious but for something to keep happening twice in a row is ridiculous. Please get it together los tacos, one more strike and I won't eat here ever again. First and last time Im ever giving a place to eat this many chances..   Ever since yesterday someone sent a message to me that works there saying I shouldn't complain and I should eat somewhere else. This is Yelp you should be ashamed of yourselves to let your brand slip to have complaints. Not my fault I had a bad experience.",

No thanks I'll gladly pay with cash but not with time. My beautiful curvy gf suggested we go next door. I'm learning to not second guess her and do what her beautiful mouth says. I had 4 tacos. 2 buche and 2 carnitas she had 2 carnitas and 2 asada. She couldn't finish the asada tacos. But because she was full. The tacos were amazing. Juicy and full of flavor. Awesome horchata and Jamaica. I would have given 5 stars but the workers kept staring at my lovely gf's yummy triple d's and the layout is awkward. U pay right next to where u wait for ur food so u crowd one area fast. Also it's pretty pricy for street tacos. 8 tacos and 2 regular drinks over $45",

I always have higher standards for taqueria joints because of my fiance.(Mexican family = FANTASTIC Mexican food)  Although I am partial to the tacos that his abuela and mama makes, I do have to admit that these were some pretty good darn tacos.  I could taste the guacamole and the crema.  Mmmm mmm mmm!  The carne asada had a very good grill/char flavor and the Al Pastor?  Oh man!  Delish!  Did I mention that although the tacos start off at $3.00 (not including guac, crema or cheese)- the tacos are HUGE.  A bottle of their green sauce (verde) is at every table.  Napkin holders at every table as well.  Why?  Because these tacos are so huge, you'll have to just grab a hold of them and dive right in.  Wipe your fingers and lips later!  Grab a fork to get the remnants that drop to the bottom of your little tray.  Everyone I went with had the chicken tacos.  I'll have to try that next time and bring the fiance down.",

I was shocked at the prices for being a fast food place with a drive-thru. The tacos are $3 each and that is before toppings. If you want cheese, avocado and sour cream it will cost you $5 per taco. The tacos tasted somewhat OK but some of my asada meat was cooked crispy and it seemed the tacos were filled with more salsa and junk then meat. It was a hot damn mess to eat. I just don't like getting ripped off when the taco doesn't even taste authentic and the tacos are overpriced. If you see the picture of my 2 tacos you will think it looks good but are you willing to pay $10 plus tax for them? After buying a drink my total was almost $14. Like I said it didn't taste bad but it wasn't anything close to Tacos El Gordo which is in the same parking lot and right next door! Just go to El Gordo trust me!",

My husband and son had the Jr. burritos with carne asada and my daughter a delicious generous size quesadilla. We we're all impressed. The side of rice and beans was 2.00 and so good. Reasonable price for families. Don't miss this place if your in Vegas! For Real!!!",

I ordered the carne asada taco (no guac or sour cream for me), cheese quesadilla and chips & salsa. The quesadilla was so cheesy and gooey... Omg it was so simple but so incredible. The carne asada tacos were perfect. The seasoning of the meat was spot on, the cheese was melty on the inside, the beans were soft not overly wet... It was an incredible taco. Even the chips and salsa were amazing! The salsa was their pico de gallo and it tasted so fresh and sweet, not damp and sour like so many places tends to. I really do not like pico de gallo under most circumstances, but I was all but licking my plate to get every bite. The only down side of the experience was the price - at over $15 for my few items, I was just pleased that the food lived up to the hype. If you haven't eaten here, do it. Do it now!!!",
