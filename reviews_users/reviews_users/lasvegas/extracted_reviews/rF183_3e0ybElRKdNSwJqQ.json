I wasn't sure if it would be the same here in Nevada and I am pleasantly surprised. Not only is the service impeccable...the Twin Peaks girls at this Henderson location are super fantastic. If you ever go, just ask to be sat with Cindy L. She's not only super beautiful and will make you want to ask for her hand in marriage within minutes of meeting her...but she's also an awesome server. very attentive and my meal was served perfectly! Head to the Peaks for the next game...you'll have a great time!",

They have an extensive bar for sitting and mixing, but their beer menu was highly lacking, mostly consisting off the macro Budweisers and the such.  They also did not show prices of mixed drinks on their menu, which is always a huge pet peeve for me.  If you're looking to watch a game, you can find worse than Twin Peaks.",

Like most 46year old guys the combination of cold beer and Twenty somethings dressed up like a party favor is a nice thing to go see. For many months I came at least twice a week. We are down to once every two weeks and I noticed that over the last weeks the place is loosing its luster. The inconsistent food and lack of change on the menu  are just making the experience stale....don't get me wrong \"Moms pot roast\" on a good day is still the bomb diggidy...but more and more the good days are in the minority and the roast is just blah..... Whoever is is charge of the corporate music channel these days could not make a living DJing down at the retirement home and is just bringing the vibe down to below 0. I wish they would fight harder to keep the energy up.....this is Vegas a bunch of pretty girls and cold beer go only so far :(",

The management sucks they have no clue on how to operate a sports bar specially when there's big events, the front desk/hoestess broads are ignorant, they we're Obviously hired on looks not for knowledge, they have their cellphones taking selfies and a whole photo-shoot, applying makeup, socializing instead of taking care of guest. The manager that was on duty had zero clue on how to operate the bar when is full capacity. Also the bar is pretty big U shaped but all the bartenders are hovering in one spot so is difficult to get a drink. I probably won't go here again, it is Vegas and is full of BARS!",

As we got up to leave the manager came over and told us our food was up and that it was going to be on the house, did we want it to go or did we want to stay and eat it there. We sat back down and again it never showed up, we walked out. If you want to give it a try remember to eat a snack and be ready to wait 45-60 minutes for your food.",

Twin Peaks is a chain sports bar made up to look like a hunting lodge and has stuffed animal heads, pelts and antlers everywhere. The girls that work there are all very good looking and nice, so that makes the visit worth while right there. The menu is very limited. It has the customary hamburgers, chicken tenders, fried pickles, some salads and soups. Doesn't really have many entrees, I had the backed trout which was very good while my wife had the venison burger that was also good.  Nothing to do cartwheels over but definitely a fun place to hang out, have a snack and drink while watching a sporting event. They have TVs all over the place, including an outdoor patio and TV monitors at all the booths.",

Cindy hands down is the best followed closely by Amanda and Kat. They run a tight ship and get you the drinks prompt and with a good attitude. Ps play Amanda in connect 4 for an easy win... It will make you feel great!   Food is above alright... I've tired it all. Chicken tacos and the steak are the best way to go. Chili is above average too. Great place to watch the nfl! Or any game!",

Thank God my Husband seen it before putting it in her mouth.The waitress apologized and gave us a new order of mozzarella bites the manager also came over and apologized and took the cost of our drinks and appetizers off of our bill. We are very grateful for that and enjoyed  the rest of our night, however I returned today two days later And ordered the bits again.  All of us at the table we're halfway through with our mozzarella bites when I felt something funny in my mouth and pulled it out and it was a piece of plastic. I decided not to say anything This time due to the fact that I was just here and had an issue so I decided to write a review instead and never return.",

Considering the food, I find myself hoping that I'm not that hungry because maybe I can get some tacos from Taco Y Taco or Vietnamese sandwich from Lee's or Pizza from Grimaldi's. It would be great to know that when you come in to watch your favorite game and talk to a few of the girls, you can look forward to your favorite wings, nachos, or burger here but just not the case.

The waitress very nicely asked her if she wanted a new burger or a new bun it was up to her it was no problem at all. My daughter is very shy so for her patience was nice. The food is just ok to me i had the philly and it was really greasy so i only ate half, my husband and daughters boyfriend got the chicken tenders and shrimp baskets, their food was fine. The food is not bad but nothing sticks out that i would recommend to someone to go undless they want a place to watch a game or see almost naked women.",

    "text": "Oh Twin Peaks... These girls were not hired for skill. It's almost like they were too air headed for Hooters so try were hired here. Ok I get the theme. And I must say that's pretty cute, great concept. But this is a local spot meaning the slutty outfits arent gong to excuse your lack of skill and knowledge for long . Here are two conversations that actually happened last night...  First Bartender- hi! Welcome to ..... Twin Peaks .she obviously forgot what the place was called.   Me- hello I'll take a scotch and soda with a twist Bartender- I don't know if we have that She stands and stares at me Me- ok could you possibly check? She leaves and comes back 5 minutes later Bartender- what kind of soda do you want Me- just soda water Bartender- oh like sparkling water? Me- that would be great She leaves comes back after talking to every bartender there Bartender- I'm sorry we don't have lemon twists Me- do you have a lemon wedge? Bartender umm let me check ...is this real life... She comes back with a lime wedge and a bourbon and water. I figured that was close enough so I head over to the table to join my group. (i was the late arrival since I was coming from work and I figured going to the bar to get a drink would have been faster since my bf informed me of their slow service at the table)  My second conversation was with our waitress.  Waitress- can I get you any drinks? Me- do you by chance have Pinot Noir here? I knew it was a long shot but I figured there had to be at least one red wine here Waitress- ummm  Me- pinot noir is a red wine Waitress- ohh! No, all we have is canyon red.  Me- that's a red wine? Waitress- yea that's what the bottle says Me- ok I'll take a glass please. We waited about 10 minutes and the waitress came back to tell me a manager had to \"get the bottle open\" so it would be right out. Don't order wine here btw, words can't describe how disgusting it is.  Bartenders that don't know what scotch or a lemon twist is. A waitress that didn't know there are more then one type of red wine and a whole restaurant that doesn't know how to open a bottle of wine. Good luck Twin Peaks... Good luck.   Btw what's up with the random girls walking around to give out \"free hugs\" I wonder what they'll put on their resume for future jobs.  Skills: friendly, outgoing, great hugger   Smh Smh Smh Smh Smh ok now I'm dizzy.",

However it is not too overly done so women are quite comfortable as well. There isn't a huge food selection but what they do offer and present are far beyond the cost. I ordered the Fish Tacos while my fellow foodies has chicken & shrimp and a chicken dish. Everything was prepared and presented well. O was pleasantly surprised with the quality as the prices were very affordable. All in all... We will be visiting again. Especially for happy hour!",

One of the girls finally got to me (I think she was one of the bar girls who noticed me standing there a while) and seated at a booth.  It took a very long time for my waitress to finally show up.  Service got better as time went on, those two initial waits really put a damper on my visit.  Food was above average for a bar/tavern/breastaraunt and the scenery is still better than Hooters (whose food sucks BTW).",

I normally get the Shrimp and Chicken combo, doesn't matter if you get it grilled or blackened, it's delicious. The wings are also delicious. Service has always been great and TV's galore! Plenty of TV's to watch and there's a TV in every booth as well for you to control. So the only reason why I'm not giving this place 4 or 5 stars is because at our most recently experience, we were sat in a booth on the North side near the restrooms and a bug bit my wife right before we payed. Everything was going well until we were given the check then all of a sudden my wife felt something crawling on her left arm and felt a bug bite her. Of course, naturally she jumped and hit the bug away. She was so gross out she just wanted to leave. I didn't want to give them two stars cause we've always had good experience except that one time.",

The management has the same respect for their patrons as they do the constant flow of employees that come and go. Which is absolutely none. It saddens me to have to write this review, but there is literally nothing to be respected about this place. The food is average and the service is probably the worst in Vegas. If you're looking to be verbally abused and taken advantage of, I would highly recommend Twin Peaks. What a joke. These people aren't service-based. Simply out to empty your pockets.

They are apparently ordering new menus.   Food was alright.... But there were some random stranger hard chunks in my chicken sandwich. Sauteed green beans is really about 50% green beans, 50% corn, onion, and bacon not what I expected.

    "text": "I came here for the first time on a Tuesday night. We had a fairly big party (roughly about 8 of us) and the service was good. Our server, Michelle, was super sweet and friendly.   We ordered a lot of different appetizers such as the pulled pork sliders, the sampler plate, chicken nachos and wings. All of which were decent, but nothing special or mind blowing. Out of all of them, I'd say the pulled pork sliders win.   The atmosphere is pretty cool. It's obviously nice for men who want to see women who in shorts and some cleavage. I loved that there were so many TVs on with different sports games on so I wasn't missing out on anything.  Overall, I'd only rate the place a 3 because the food is just mediocre, doesn't have much selection but the service we received that day made up for it.",

As I walked into the restaurant, I could see that people were engrossed in conversations, laughter, and accompanied by good food.   The waitresses are really good with their service. The friends that I arrived with have a particular \"set of demands\" and every request that we threw at our waitress (Genies), she did her very best to accommodate us. Also, I need to mention, I drink a ton of water, so I really appreciated that our server never let my drink cup reach below the halfway mark before bringing me another refill. This was very attentive on her part. As an appetizer, my friends and I shared the Fried Pickles and I ordered the Sourdough BLT with a side of fire fries (don't worry they are not spicy- the name comes from their seasoning). I can only speak for myself, but I found the food to be rather enjoyable and, judging from the expressions of my friend's, I am sure they did too.    You can expect to see a large ratio of men at the restaurant. But what do you expect when you have young beautiful women roaming around and serving you food!? They have television sets that surround the entire restaurant streaming a variety of sporting events. The place was nicely decorated and has a cabin-like feel with taxidermy work surrounding the perimeter of the main room.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience and would definitely come here again. Next time, I'll be sure to try more of what's on their menu :-P",

Let's be honest, if you're heading over to Twin Peaks you're not going for gourmet dining. You're probably going with a few buds, grabbing some beers, maybe a few apps, watching a game, and enjoying your surroundings. This place is perfect for just that.  Honestly, I had no idea what Twin Peaks was beforehand (no, seriously, I had no clue) which is why I laughed really hard inside when I walked in with my wife and was greeted by some peaks. I like this place a lot more than Hooters, which I'm sure it's commonly compared to. The atmosphere is better, TV's great, service was pretty solid also. We had burgers for dinner, nothing flashy, and they were alright. Nothing to rave about. I'd definitely come back under the circumstances I opened with, but probably wouldn't run back to dine with my significant other, lol. I do appreciate the super-duper ice cold beer that they have. It's exactly how every beer should be served everywhere.   A night out with the boys, a few beers after work, catching a football or basketball game, something along those lines would bring me back to Twin Peaks.",

We were going to go to B.J.'s but he'd been there before so we thought we'd try TP.  My hubby & I had been there for drinks but not for food.  Hind sight is 20/20: should have gone to B.J.'s--been there many times and it is ALWAYS good.   Have done TP and won't do it again.  The service was less than average.  We had to wait a good half hour for our food.  The excuse:  there was a large party.  The \"large party\" that we saw was a group of about 10; the rest of the restaurant was not even  1/2 full and servers galore.  What was the problem here folks?  Plus when we ordered, hubby and I ordered a burger which came with fries.  When asked if we could substitute, the server showed us the list.  One of the selections was grilled asparagus; we specifically asked \"is that a True substitute\"; she said yes.  Yet when I was settling our tab, we were charged $1 each for the two selections.  THAT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE!  It wasn't the $2 extra charge; it's the principal.  The food was ho hum.  The asparagus was actually the best part of our meal!  How ironic.  The beers were pricey especially in comparison to the beers/prices next door!  Anyway, I would NOT recommend this place to anyone.  Go to B.J.'s next door for truly awesome service, terrific beers, and great food!",

We've learned to order when half done because servers usually take a bit longer than other places. Food is pretty good, best fried pickles!! But the last time we went I was appalled by the service we received. We all were. Our server was a newer girl, it took 30 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered them!! That could even be forgiven.... When it was time to order food, she set dirty plates from another table on ours to take our order!! She did this on two separate occasions!!! Several items came out wrong and had to go back, our daughter couldn't get a spoon for her ice cream and then the check was wrong we were over charged. All the times the food went back and she rerang the order they tagged it on our bill and she presented it to us. We spoke to management at the end and she said she would reach out to us and never did, this was two weeks ago. I was hoping for some sort of correspondence to show we are valued customers. No such luck. Fair warning, if you go and Hanah is your server ask for a different section!! This girl was sweet but does not understand health codes or have any sense of urgency!!!!",

It's one thing to mess up on orders one or two times, but to NEVER get your order right every time the server came back was awful. I didn't order beer and asked for water, she came back 4 times and forgot my water but remembered my friends beer orders, somewhat. She brought a different beer for my boyfriend but he drank it anyways knowing she wasn't coming back for a while. Our food was okay besides for the chicken nachos, which our server forgot to put in an order for and came out at the very end. I don't know how you mess up nachos but the chicken tasted terrible and covered in gross fake cheese. She forgot our plates well after our appetizers came out so we just started eating off the appetizer plate. OH AND FOR DESSERT I was craving the HOT brownie Sunday that they advertise as a HOT brownie with ice cream on top. Simple, right? The server came out with it and said she made sure it was extra good, meaning she probably made it worse or probably even spit it in. The Sunday was served on a skillet meaning that it should be hot and not to touch, but the brownie was colder than the ice cream on top. I was furious after this first time here. NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN. And will tell all my friends my experience. I've never had such a terrible experience going out for drinks and a few bites to eat.",

Anyways, up the beer selections on tap and it would get a 5star BUT i didnt try the food except some fried cheese balls so really dont have a say on the food. So all in all it's a nice place to kick it with the guys and watch a game. Will go again for sure",

    "text": "We went for the UFC on November 12th. The reserved table we paid for was not ready and the asst. manager had to remove people from our table and they were not happy. Then the table was dirty and we had to ask the server to clean off the table and wipe it. Then she was only over to our table about every 25 minutes. The food was fine. They sell so many standing room only tickets for the UFC that people stand directly in front of you with their backs touching our backs and pushing on our chairs. A group of people start to argue and get ready to fight, the bartenders, waitresses and managers do nothing to stop it, and MANY staff seen what was happening. The people involved in the fights were over-served by the bartenders and were drunk. When a brawl starts with punches flying and a table top being broken off the pedestal, security takes way too long to get to the fight, in fact they were so slow that customers took the guys down and held them on the floor. Then security gets to the fight and they let the guys argue and continue to fight with each other instead of removing them from the situation. After they finally take out the guy that starts the fight, 10 minutes later he is back into the restaurant again. The sound on the system was too low and you weren't able to hear the UFC. When i called the general manger the next morning to tell them how pissed i was that we paid $40 for four of us to watch the UFC and had a terrible time she said (and i quote) i can talk to you if you make it quick because I'm trying to get the TV's turned on. I said I'm pissed about last night. She then said \"about what\". I said don't you know you had a brawl in your restaurant. She said ya i know there was a brawl, and then she said (and i quote) what's your problem? I said they were over capacity and handled the brawl terribly. She said (and i quote) we weren't over capacity and i don't have time to get into it right now because I'm trying to get the restaurant ready. I told her don't worry about it, i will call corporate and tell them about it. They WERE very over capacity, very unprofessional, and obviously don't know how to run a restaurant or handle customer complaints. I am a former general manager of restaurants myself as were two others at our table and we are very disappointed at the Twin Peaks manager and some of the staff. I guess that is why when you go to Twin Peaks Henderson on any day that there is not a UFC or football game going on the place is not busy at all. I will not be back as they DO NOT care about their customers.",

I normally go to higher end restaurants so am used to good service.  The only thing that unnerved me was that both of our plates sat in front of us for 15 mins after we were done.  I even pushed our plates in towards the bartenders to show we were done.  The bartenders walked by our dirty plates at least 12 times and no one even thought to pre-bus.  What kind of bartender doesn't pre-bus after they have been done for over 10 mins.  I will not go back because of that.",

    "text": "Attn: NFL fans; Twin peaks mgmt is Terrible, terrible, terrible. Absolutely the worst customer service in Las Vegas. They don't want to change channels, turn up sound, or cater to the NFL fans spending money. I had written a bad review previously and was assured by the GM that was during preseason, \"preseason doesn't matter\". Well once again today, Week 11 when I decided to return they are back at it. The manager Jimmy wants to spend his time flirting with his staff by setting up a table for himself with all the female servers gathered around him. When I asked for the TV to be changed to the game I requested I was referred to \"the map\" which tells me where to sit so I can watch that game.  Really? Nobody in the place for a 10am game but this guy acts like they're packed. This might fly in a town without the powerhouse of sports bars Las Vegas has but it won't here. I didn't hold my tongue after quite a few expletives and closing my tab I left. Enjoy your 5 years Twin Peaks Henderson,  that's the most you have left. If you didn't have the girls you would already have the \"For Lease\" sign up.",

She lifted the bun with her hand touched the patty and said it was between the cheese and the patty. I still couldn't find it. She took it back and brought the same one back. And said that's the way they make it. The manager brought a dinky little bowl of chili but no spoon.  Service was not good. Too bad",

This place clearly has none. It is with the hopes of dressing their servers in merely \"hooker attire\"  to lure old men to be the basis of their repeat clientele. Good luck with that.  Upon arricing 40 min early for the Thursday first NFL game, the girlie greeting us with considerable empty tables scattered throufhout the restaurant, told us they were all reserved. Really?? They dont even reserve tables. The next thing I asked was if I could put my name on the \"list\" to be seated on next available. The girlie told me that she wouldn't know when if ever I could be seated before the game was over....REALLY?? If you don't want my money that badly...trust me, you will NEVER GET ONE PENNY! Hope the old men keep you sustained...I predict a fall in months to come.",

Between the three of them and my husband; my Mom and I were talked into lunch at Twin Peaks, because we love those four guys. I agree, Brianda is your girl. She is on it, and I would recommend her as your server, if you can get into her section. Because we were driving and had stuff to do, we didn't try the beer. But, we were impressed with their cooler with the temp gauge on top. They clearly take that pretty seriously. The decor is cute for the theme. If I was meeting a few friends for a beer after work, this could be a good place, depending on who was joining me. My sons and husband appreciated the waitress uniforms and subsequent scenic views, too. The food, we all agreed, was 'meh'. It's bar food, and it's ok-ish. If I was drinking some beers, it would have been exactly the kind of thing I wanted. Since this is really a bar with food, I would recommend it for that purpose. Beers and bar food with the gang--it's a good choice for that. Also, had lots of plasmas and various sporting channels going in the bar, so if you wanted to see a particular game or something, this would be a good spot for that, I think. I do like good beers, and will go back to try their two house brews with friends, for sure.",

If your he/she is used to seeing a few C's, B's, and mostly A's then Twin peaks is for your family.   In all seriousness, I was thoroughly unimpressed with this Rugged Cabin-turned-Sports bar restaurant. Yes, the servers are cute and friendly but when the food is lacking then it's just another Hooter's off brand.   The location has a huge bar smack dab in the middle of the restaurant and has at least 12 large flat screen tv's. In addition to that, every booth on the wall has a smaller tv you can control. All of the larger Tv's had a sports game playing and some had the same channel on side by side. Why would I want to watch a Teeny tv when i could turn my head and watch it playing over the bar? The answers is overkill. Too many tv's playing the same 4 channels.   We went during dinner time but the portions screamed lunch. We got a side of queso and chips plus boneless wings (I should say nuggets because these things were tiny. Like 2 bites tiny ) The queso was described on the menu as chipotle so I was expecting a kick but instead it was just very very watery cheese. Sorry- but queso is supposed to be thick and creamy! I don't think I ordered soup...  On the plus side, the philli cheese steak had good flavor and the bell peppers weren't too Wiltly. My blackened shrimp and chicken was okay but I would prefer my food not to be so salty. I'm sorry but i can't justify spending the money we did and not feeling fully satisfied.   Again, the service and view was not terrible however our appetizer \"wings\" did come out of the kitchen after our food. They were hot and fresh so I just assumed the kitchen was backed up.   At the request of my husband we will try this place again, maybe during lunch when the prices will hopefully mirror the portions. If it were up to me I would not be back.",

The ladies on the bar were horrible. 15 minutes before I was ever acknowledged, when she brought my beer I asked if the game could be put on the TV in front of me.....she said \"yea sure\". TV was never changed. And hour later after no one came to ask if I wanted anything to eat I placed my credit card on the bar. 20 min later one of the bartenders grab it, ran it and set it down with a quick and unfriendly \"thanks\". Like I said I've been coming here for years spent a lot of money, tip on average 30 percent. And for the first time in my 50 years I left a 0 tip. So disappointed in TP. You all ate really letting your service slip. I definitely wont be back on a Wednesday night.....",

They have a good selection of wing types and wing sauces that taste great, but they taste like any other wings from other bars. The pulled pork nachos are the real winner. The pulled pork was tender and they used real cheese and not that fake, nacho cheese stuff. The only critic I would have is that there should be more cheese on it, as it didn't taste \"cheesy\" enough. If you're going to order this, I'd recommend asking for extra cheese!",

The sound for the game was on through the speakers and everyone was watching as well then suddenly they changed it to basketball !... with all the respect for all the basketball fans. I'm a basketball fan myself but it doesn't make sense to change the sound of the game to the basketball game when everyone is enjoying the hockey game.  I asked the manger what happened and he said it's a Corporate thing!! And it must be on basketball..! Then why did you have it on the Golden Knights hockey game to begin with if it's a Corporate Thing.!! I guess it was more like a random answer just to carry on! Like people don't know any better or they're Stupid.  One thing that the Cooperate must know is that the Golden Knights are a LasVegas Born team and when the game is on Locals love to support there team and watch the game! Don't forget that we Locals support the Business and the word of mouth to mouth is much stronger then Advertisement! For this place! Unfortunately the Corporate world even takes the enjoyment away from people on every level and we all know that! Also to add that the Fried pickles were really bad not like they used to be. Just good for garbage! I don't recommend this place at all and if you're looking to watch any sports or game that's on and have a good time with friends and family try other places.",

The friendly guy next to me said the Bud Light on tap was as cold as Ice as the temperature gauge in the front read 27 degrees so when he got his beer it literally had ice in it!    My parents would really love to come here!  He also recommended the New Fowl Play, which is a Turkey Burger.  Looks so great that I can't wait to go back & order it!  I had just eaten, but he got it & I could not tell it was a Turkey Burger cause it looked juicy & amazing like a regular beef burger.  I will be back very soon to try this & the Hunters Meat & Cheese Board!  The New items look fantastic & if you don't have a place to watch the Mayweather fight... here it's $30!",

Other than that, the food was nothing to die for. The sliders buns were pretty hard and we didn't even eat them. The one decent thing was the buffalo wings. From what I recall they don't call it buffalo, but it was pretty much buffalo sauce. The girl was nice but wait times were heavy. It's nice inside but just another normal place. Not too crazy about it, probably wouldn't go unless it was somewhere someone really wanted to go.  These girls gotta learn how to smile and look friendly, not snotty and stuck up. Just sayin!",

I have not tried any other food here, so I can't comment on the rest of their menu items. But they do serve a large variety of beer in big frosted mugs (the frosted mug is a nice touch, as it really makes a difference in taste and keeps that beer cold the entire time your drinking it). The atmosphere is what you would expect....pretty female waitresses/bartenders and lots of tv's tuned into the day's sports....overall, a very good bar.",

There was a couple of snobby waitresses, you know the kind that only smile when there in the presents of someone that's going to give them $$.  But no concern of mine.  So we ordered a beer, I forgot which one.  But I like the fact they have cold glasses, and the beer has ice particals on the top of it.   So we ordered, Nachos!  I love nachos.  So when the nachos came they were huge! There is now way I could eat this buy myself.  3 people can eat off of this plate, and we will all be full!  These nachos were great!   The salsa I was really shocked at how good that was.  I can't remember the guy that was talking to us.  He might have been a Manager, he was also very nice. Brought us more salsa, held a nice conversation.   For the most part I really like the vibe in this place.     I look forward to going back and trying other things on the menu.",

They put the game on a couple of the many TVs but never put on the audio despite my waitresses reassurance that they would.

Appetizer platter, green chile meatloaf, hangover burger, smokehouse, and pot roast are my favorites.  Food is always good.  I sometimes wonder if I like the food or girls better.    They show all major sporting events as well as the UFC.  There is a nominal cover charge of $10 for the UFC.    Huge HDTVs all around the bar and throughout the restaurant.  Makes you feel like you're always in the action.  The bar is gigantic and can seat an army.    The entire staff is very friendly.  As soon as you step foot inside the girl up front greet you with a smile and a hello.  The decor has sort of a lodge feel, but its not dark and drab.  Lots of eye candy.  Definitely a good place to grab some food, drinks, or both.",

The beer is 27* (which has ruined draft beer at other places for me) the customer service shown by Modesto and Alyssa is amazing Tory has also been fantastic! Watching her multitask is like art! Great team behind the bar led by phenomenal manager Anjel.  My friend and I have frequented here while opening a restaurant down the street. It was nice always being greeted by warm smiles and people that knew us by name and knew our order. Again can not say enough how fantastic the service is here and the cold beer is amazing!!!",

Bartenders didn't realize i had sat down the bar for 3 minutes, although i had been seated by the host. Understandable, they were in conversation. Get delivered my beer, then ignored for 10 minutes while they continue their conversation. Receiving my food was the last interaction i had with both of them, aside from needing to flag them down so i could pay my bill. Conversation from when i walked in continued the entirety of my meal  Food: Lazy. Ordered a med rare burger, received a well done burger that had sat on the edge of the grill for (roughly) 15 minutes (side note: i was a cook for 8 uears, and ran a burger grill for about a year. I know how they operate, which is why i asked for med rare, so it would be freshly cooked)   i realize that it sucks working service industry, especially when its a holiday and you're stuck at work, but that's no excuse for bad service",

Ok so we're really here for food and drinks but the ladies are an excellent complement to it all.   I'm fan of their chicken wings, they're plump and juicy.  Actually they're a lot better than those on the Strip when it came to plumpiness and juiciness. When I order them I usually get the green chile parmesan. GET THEM!! Tasty, they're my favorite I don't even know why I ordered the tried the other flavors. But if you must know they have them BBQ flavored which I didn't like, some ghost pepper flavored which was alright a little sweet than hot, and a red hot flavored which was alright. It's a shame they can't make the chicken tenders in green chile parmesan.   They have the Hangover burger which is your usually cheese burger with bacon, red onion, mayo, lettuce, tomato but with a fried egg. Fried egg on anything makes it instantly good especially a burger. It should be a crime to have a burger without a fried egg.  They have a venison chili burger which I had to try just because it was venison and I don't usually see that. It was ok. The meat tasted the same as if I was eating a beef burger.  I've heard about the meatloaf. Still haven't tried it but maybe I will next time. And their nachos look huge.   I'm a fan of the woodsy cabin/ sportsbar environment with all of the stuffed animals and TV all over the place. When it's nice outside they open up their outside patio area which I'm sure everyone wants.  The staff are always friendly and handles whatever the size of our party is, large or small. Very accommodating. Most of the customers I've seen here are guys but I've occasionally seen guys bring their family (wife and kids) here I'm sure they didn't mind it and sometimes other ladies there. It is a place to eat and drink after all.   They restrooms signs crack me up. Family P, Stand 2-P, and Sit 2-P. What if a dude wanted to sit or if a female wanted to stand!? I'm pretty sure it would be awkward haha. Nice restrooms too though TV inside.  Don't be shy take a pic with the ladies.",

We have come here over a dozen times trying to give it a chance because of the food, our friends and its hot spot reputation but have been dissapointed every time.

I've dined at twin peaks multiple times before for lunch or drinks and dinner and I've always felt the food was little too americana with tacos made with hamburger veggie toppings or very non inventive dishes where all steak or fish is served with a starch and a veggie. However NOW I will say they've added new items to their menu and I'm thrilled! I'll definitely be coming back! They've just now added a vegetarian option (outside of ordering a salad) being the Beyond Burger and it is amazing! I had it substituted into one of their traditional burger selections (BBQ Honey Cheddar burger). It was great paired with a Dirty Blonde house beer in the overly frosted mug. Can't wait to go back for the Beyond Burger again.",

Well today was the day I did a Audit at twin peaks(of course they didn't know, which is why we do them). Unbeknownst to the staff, there are people who simply pay attention to the customer service in an establishment. Well today the \"Manager\" Chris(baldhead) was very rude during the quickest interaction we had. I approached him to buy a table for the fight tonight due to it being fight night and crowded. So I let him know I wanted to buy a table and he informed me all he had was the back patio so how many do I have. I let him know I had 4, and I asked if that's for tonight or for the current moment \"5:15pm\" . He looked at me and said \"right now or later that's the same thing\". I looked at him and realized he didn't care about being nice to anyone despite the hectic ness of the establishment at the moment. It's a very bad way to make someone feel, especially walking into your establishment for the first time ever. Unacceptable and this is why their are company's such as mines that find the ones that need to be picked out. Thank you Chris , for a wonderful article to not only write on here but also our company .   Mia",

Fine that you put it on a baking tin because \"no one could carry it\" on the platter, as your waitress told us. Changing the chips to cheaper greasy ones wasn't a brilliant idea either. Why take away the chipotle sour cream and have just plain?? Now the only thing that differentiates it from any other nacho plate is just the barbecue sauce, and you'll probably change that too. You had an awesome brag worthy dish, now it's just greasy nachos with BBQ sauce......extremely disappointing",

Why reserve tables when you have people willing to spend money on multiple drinks & food vs wasting money on someone that will come in, order one drink watch the fights and leave???? Makes no sense.   We called ahead to see about showing the fight and they replied with yes. Later the general Mgr announces no fight and we could get our \"money\" back and they ended up paying us with coupons wth??",

We both got our extra ranch/tartar sauce, and never ran out of drinks. Nice, big TVs everywhere. There's a lot on the beer menu, including some of their own brews. We'll be back again.",

Not only did it take 15 minutes she didn't pour my beer while waiting for my other half to decide on continuing with a beer he asked to sample.

The first time, after being seated, we waited for 15 minutes, and even asked another waitress if she was our or if she could get someone for us. Nobody came so we left, unnoticed.  Second visit, because friends like watching football there, I regretably went, again. And of course, not only does the food come out cold, they run out of Bud Light, at 1pm on a Sunday afternoon. Really?  The third and LAST time, again with friends to watch football because it is in the neighborhood. This time the food wasnt cold, it just never came out, AND they run out of Bud Light AGAIN!   Needless to say, this place is A Joke! There is no excuse that can be made for repetitive cold or no-show food and inventory mismanagement. This is a 'Top-Down' issue. Some people will put up with this, but I will not and I will let as many people as possible know.",

The Servers are especially friendly too which makes the experience all the more enjoyable.  I have to give a special shout out to Kat... she's a great server and fun to chat with.  Somehow she made a double overtime playoff loss to the Sharks enjoyable anyway.  I plan to return so she can serve me again...",

We were seated and 5 min later the waitress came and have us a 4 min speal about the restaurant. She took our drink orders a beer and a water. It was over 20min until we had our drinks. The waitress then tried to leave without taking our food order. In total we saw our waitress 4 times in 1.5 hrs after our food came I asked the other waitress if the manger was working and if he could bring our check to us. I told him that we were pretty sure his waitress was high or something and the quality of the service received. He thanked us for letting us know and stated that she did seem off tonight. The manger then proceeded to confront the waitress while we were still there and on the floor with customers and other staff around VERRY CLASSY! The waitress apologized  and said that she thought she let us know what was going on.  Overall the food and beer was very good however the service and management is that of the worst restaurants I have been to.",

I like the ghost pepper wings and the billionaire bacon burger.  Too many tattoos in there though...unless you're into that of course.  Great place to watch sports as well.",

Went last night to see the ufc fight,  have some drinks and food.     3 seats down from where me and my husband were,  your lousy rent a cops came over due to a fight. Instead of throwing the trouble makers out, your pathetic security were fist bumping them and saying to calm down.  Guess what....they didn't calm down.  FULL BLOWN BRAWL WITH POLICE, PATRONS RUNNING AND CHAOS .  We paid all nights for drinks, food and cover to not see the main ufc event that but worse havr our lives put in jeopardy.  lousy security and end of experience but I will say your food has always been great. Fried pickers, blackened ck quesadillas,  and  burgers are the best I've had on this side of town.  Service  you the girls is always great. it's sad your hired security don't do their jobs on these big. event nights and it reflects totally on YOU.",

She always remembers us and stops by to say hello. The food here is great. The service is great most of the time. Only had one visit during football when the service was so-so. And another waitress came by and grabbed us drinks to make up for the slow service. They always have on lots of sports or they are willing to change one of the TV'S to put Chicago sports on for us. Really fun and always a good time.",

We ordered drinks and some food with our waitress who seemed distracted.  It took about 30 min for the food to arrive as drinks got here just before that.   I got the wrong salad and no sauce came with the chicken wings.   We ordered more drinks and they took an additional 25 min and and then my salad finally came.   Still no sauce.  So we asked for a Mgr and his excuse on the drinks was \"we ran out of shot glasses\".  How does a bar run out of shot glasses?   When he was also told about the sauce and he said oh well I can get the sauce.   By now the wings are cold and we told him that.   He said ok I'll get too another order of wings.   He left and no one came to clear our table so we ended up clearing it ourselves to give us table room.   Needless to say it has now been 20 more min and they just arrived.  They might be having a rough night and I get it but that was too many things happening for one night",

    "text": "Came here for Happy Hour for the first time. Not impressed at all from the moment we walked in the door till we left. The place itself is big, great set up to hang out watch the game and what not but horrible service and for the food not much to say.   So my girlfriend and I came in stood at the front for about 5 minutes until someone finally took the time to approach us they didn't say anything just stared at us up and down and we responded \"Do we seat ourselves?\" The host said no and continues to stare us down as she grabs menus. We ask to be seated outside it was a bit crowded inside  so we felt like outside seating would be our best option.   The server who helped us was friendly at first gives us their crappy \"Happy Hour\" run down. Super limited BTW its not worth it. We order, she cards us and then leaves. Our food arrived quick. At this point we had our third guest join us. He places his order and from there it went downhill. Took 15 minutes to get water and when my water arrives there's some black dirt floating on top of my water. I let my server know she laughs and takes my water back. We asked for napkins she pulls out this wrinkled napkin from the bottom of her apron and says \" Aww I have this one or do you want me to get more?\" What do you think the answer to that would be? NO I don't want that nasty napkin that came from the bottom of your apron.   By the time we tried to pay it took an unrealistic amount of time. Our server was missing for who knows how long. Finally when we get our bill we inform her to deduct the cash from the total, split the bill in half with both cards and add a burger to go on this card. SIMPLE MATH!!! She took over 20 minutes to return with our payment brings it back completely wrong I have no idea where she pulled the numbers she gave us I had to physically correct her by pulling out a calculator and did the math for her. I then had to write the steps down on the receipt so she could comprehend the math.   It literally took us 1 hour for the payment process. I believe our server wasn't sober. This place is a great spot to hang out and has a lot of potential but I'm guessing they market towards men who want to stare at their practically nude bodies and hustle them. By all means LOOK good and show it off but a girl with LOOKs and NO brains are only good for one thing.... From the 5 girls we came across that night they where only good for 1 thing. So by all means if your the type that likes to look come here and get hustled.",

Also, we were surprised to see customers bringing their children to a restaurant where the hostesses and food servers wear skimpy bikinis.

Some servers are super friendly, some are snobbish and stand-offish. I have found its better to come during the week. We could come more often if the service was more consistent. A few times the server has forgotten about us  (hence why we only sit at the bar now). It's gotten to a point where we will peak in to see who is working to see if he stay or not. Wish they put more emphasis on friendly staff verses looks.",

I'm getting pissed! Then that tables two drinks gets to their table. My friend has to go in there to explain what happened, not that our waitress checks on us. It finally comes at 1:04 pm, 55 minutes to get a beer, not bad. I could've gone to bj's ordered a beer drank it and come back to my seat! Why bother? Instead of comping it, which is what I would've done, oh I'm sorry, but you're still paying the $6.50 for it. That is the last $6.50 twin peaks will ever get from me! Word of mouth guys!

    "text": "One of my fav places to grab a bite and watch the game with family.  Happy hour is a great deal but honestly the prices are bad at anytime.  The big plus for me is the super cold beer.  I also love the philly cheesesteak done southwest style.  I like mine in a tortilla instead of on a hoagie.  My daughters love the burgers and you can't go wrong with one of the fried baskets.  I'm a fried pickle fan and this is one of the few places that has really good fried pickle chips in town and they aren't overly salty.  Of course it's not a trip to twin peaks if you don't have an order of billionaire bacon.    My only complaint is some of the wait staff are overly friendly to the point you can't eat your dinner.  I don't need to know your whole life story.....just saying!",

When we went (Thursday evening), there were a good amount of customers, but, because of the size, the place feels empty.  Service was prompt, if not overly-friendly.   Beer selection is decent and they're very cold (as advertised).  I had the steak salad, which was actually quite good, although I might ask for light dressing next time. My husband had the chicken fried steak and it was ENORMOUS. Seriously, like 4 chicken fried steaks all put together. It lays on top of the potatoes and veggies and totally covers them and the whole plate. And hangs off the sides of the plate. Whoa. I had a bite and the meat was good, just a little bland on the gravy side.  Overall, there's nothing to complain about, I just don't think it's special enough to earn one of our few nights out.",

We ended up paying $60 for the table so that we didn't have to share the booth or move to another section. Our server August (or something close to that) was awesome. Polite, attentive and never to overbearing (we were there for over five hrs). She also made a couple beer selections that were good. My favorite was the knotty brunette draft. Yummier than new castle! I liked this place more than Hooters cause the food is actually tasty and doesn't upset my stomach like Hooters does. The bacon appetizer and fish tacos and red hot wings were all yummy. The only thing I find weird is kids in there. Not a atmosphere for kids in my opinion. We will be back!",

If you're looking for a really loud, obnoxious sports bar with waitresses acting way over enthusiastically about everything to upsell you on drinks...well, this is about as good as it's going to get.  I'll also have to give them big credit for actually having really good food...was not expecting that after I walked in and checked the environment.  A note regarding the sexy girl staff....A+ on the week night I was there :-)  But since I attended with my girlfriend...well, you know...had to practice a bit of \"eye control\".  Even considering the intended environment, I'd say the music is too loud.  You're going to have to speak very loudly to even have a conversation at your own table.  It's a symptom of poor acoustical design...for probably several thousand dollars in consulting and several thousand more in equipment/materials this could, and should, be fixed.",

    "text": "I have visited this restaurant twice in the last month. Both times the service has been good to excellent...today with Kiki, it was excellent.   No need to say anything about the beer that hasn't been said....frickin' ICE COLD!!!  1st visit I had the philly steak, which I thought was above average, also ordered an app. which I had to send back...more on this later.  Today I tried a burger, food is subjective IMHO, so to me it was a good burger but nothing spectacular.   I ordered the same appetizer as last time and had to send it back again!!!  So here's where the 4 stars comes in instead of five...the billionaire bacon is AMAZING....when it's warm to hot.  Both visits the bacon was served at or below room temperature only to be sent back to be heated up.   Today, Kiki tells me the kitchen informs her the bacon is SUPPOSED to be served cold.  WTF??? is it just me; or does anyone else think it's bizarre to serve bacon cold?? If this is indeed their way of serving it, maybe mention it on the menu???  Anyway, will be back for the cold beer, good service and HOT bacon....as long as I order it that way before hand...lol!!!  I also look forward to trying a different main course.  Just an FYI, both times I was with my wife, so I'm not some perv. just there for the view.",

Do not settle your bill with the waitress leaving because she will take your money and run; you will be forgotten. This is the third time in a row we have sat with dirty dishes and empty glasses on our table for over half an hour after either a shift change or our waitress being cut. There were five of us, the waitress walked away after taking only four food orders, and one of those was wrong. She was sent home shortly after and that was the last interaction we had with any staff. We tried to flag down a waitress who said she would be right there and then she never came back. I said it in my last review, just go to The Bar on LV Blvd & Wigwam. Always great service and the best bar menu in LV.",

I called CORPORATE to complain and am still waiting for a DISTRICT MANAGER TO CALL ME BACK.   Apparently Twin Peaks Corporate doesn't care either.  Twin Peaks doesn't try to resolve any problems and most importantly their corporation doesn't care because they don't return your call and find out what they can do to keep their customers.

    "text": "I am actually a fan of Twin Peaks. Frequent them any chance I can get. This actual rating is based on what happened after my original server was sent home for the night. She was actually great, and the food I had was good. Tried the spicy thai ribs and had a wedge salad. The ribs had a lot of meat and were cooked perfectly. During my meal my server was being sent home because of how slow it was. This was the evening of July 4th by the way. She did ask if I wanted to cash out with her or just transfer the check over to a new server. I just cashed out so I could give her the tip. Well it appears that doing that could have been a mistake. She printed my receipt at 7:33pm, and lets just round it up to 7:40 pm when she said good-bye. Well I still was eating my meal. Usually, from my experience, a new server will come by to introduce herself, or the previous server will bring one by to say \"This is Jane Doe and she will be taking care of you for the rest of your stay\". Well I finished my meal and still no one had come over to ask how I was. This was maybe a little before 8pm. There were 3 tables right next to me that were getting tons of attention from their server. You would think this server might glance over or maybe inquire to see if i needed anything. So of course I was going to let this play out. I sat there, and sat there, and sat there some more. Empty plates and drinks in front of me. Soon it was 8:10pm, 8:20pm, 8:30pm, 8:40pm. And I finally had one of the bussers bring over a manager at 8:50pm. I kindly informed him that I had sat there for an hour and 10 minutes and not one person came over to see if i needed anything. He did apologize. And to be honest I wasnt expecting anything from him, since I already paid my meal. I kind of found it comical in the sense that how can someone drop the ball like this and not see someone sitting there all that time. I dont think I was invisible. Was it not communicated to anyone that my original server was going home? How could an hour and 10 minutes go by and not one person, especially the one server who was working right next to my table, ask if i needed anything. Hopefully someone will figure something out so this doesnt  happened again. Maybe the other servers knew I had cashed out and that I wasnt going to tip them, so they werent going to take care of my table. Who knows. We'll see what happens on my next visit.",

It's a really big portion, and the accompanying green beans are covered in bacon. Awesome! The roast was very good, yet I did kinda miss carrots, and the gravy could've been more flavorful. Nothing wrong with the potatoes either.  My beverage of choice for this chilly day was coffee. This was the surprise of the meal, as it was really great coffee! And at $2.59, that's crazy! Considering many places charge $4 for bottom of the pot crap.   I sat at the bar, and it's a typical sporty atmosphere. The bar chairs are not stools, they are comfortable chairs with padded seats! Luxury. I noticed the temp sign showing the beer temp was around 29 degrees.  Sounds great for a few months away! I would return here for some of that chilly beer if they had gaming. This shopping area is usually on my no fly list because it's a cluster you know what. The coldest beer in town gets my attention tho!",

She was friendly, beautiful and most importantly patient with all of our nonsense. Service was fast and the food wasn't bad. I had the fried chicken sandwich with fries.

There are TVs all around the main bar and even mini TVs installed at individual booths.   Twin Peaks attracts a male crowd but my girlfriends and I don't mind going. The servers are all super friendly and the service isn't bad!   Food and drinks come out in a timely manner. I've had their appetizer platter, wings, and nachos. They have typical bar food... Good but nothing special.   I love the Bloody Marys here because it comes with a piece of peppered bacon. I could sit and order Bloody Marys all day for the bacon garnish! Their beer is a different story. I've gotten their Blonde ale but their beer is so cold that it has frozen chunks in it. Some people love it but I don't prefer beer ice cubes in my beer.   I've done the shot-ski here before twice with shots of fireball. Once the manager offered us a complimentary one and the other time we thought for some reason that it was an excellent idea. Quite entertaining!   I'll probably be back and will get the Bloody Mary. If you like bloodies (and bacon) I definitely recommend!",

    "text": "I was undecided on how to write this review for one big reason: I have been there maybe 9 or 10 times now and gotten beyond exceptional service half the time and pretty low-end service the other half.  That being said...  The Pros: The hosts, managers, and girls at the bar have always been very friendly.  They take a minute to find out your name, ask how you are doing, and make some recommendations if you need it.  The happy hour specials are superb and our various groups have enjoyed the steak salads and pot roast.  The TVs are everywhere, in good condition, and have a good mix of games on.  Friendly bartenders, large beers, good happy hour.  Check, check, check.  The Cons: So after two amazing experiences in groups of 2 and 3 we went on a Sunday afternoon for the patio and recommended the joint to some friends.  I felt bad recommending the place with the service we got.  Our waitress was at the host stand with her head down and apparently spacing out.  Between our first drink order and ordering food/shots, it took something like 19 minutes in a pretty empty restaurant.  Total time between finishing our first round and actually getting our second round/drinks/shots came out to something like 35 or 40 minutes.  We kindly just paid our bill, tipped, left, and got some drinks down the street.   So since then...it goes back and forth between amazing service and mediocre/bad service.  About half the girls are amazing and the other half seem like the would rather be putting bamboo shafts into their nails than working.  It mostly seems like the bar is where we consistently get good service.  Myself and my fiance will be back when we want a quick drink and salad during happy hour, but I probably couldn't justify coming here for full-priced drinks or suggesting the place to friends/coworkers with such hit-or-miss service.",

    "text": "Yesterday July, 30, 2016 at 6pm. My wife and I took two friends from California to this Sports bar for dinner and drinks. When we entered the Hostess asked if we were there for the UFC fight and we said no were there for dinner and drinks. We were told that in order to be set at the higher tables we would have to pay the $10.00 apiece as they were reserved for fight customers only. We were given at small 4 person table. After approximately 1.5  hour while we were still enjoying our dinner our waitress came to the table and told us that we would have to leave as the main event would be coming on and that they were told by management we would have to leave as we had not paid the fee.  We asked why a paying customer would have to leave even though we had stated we were not there to watch the fight and had no desire to add $40 for our table to the bill. We were told that it was the management's policy during the pay for view  fight . We have had this happen twice before at this same restaurant/bar. As we were leaving my wife spoke with one  shift manager and then spoke with the  general manager. That person apologized and told us that it was not the policy and offered to reseat us and to buy us a beer. By this time our friends from California who were very upset had left the restaurant and did not wish to return.   The food and service are good here but this was the third time this had happened to us at the  place on a fight night. While we were there, there were plenty of vacant tables. You would think that cooperate would want them filled with paying customers.",

Every girl we talked to, and there were a few between the hostess (who later became our waitress) our first waitress, another girl who brought drinks and another one who just walked by, were really really nice! I was actually blown away by that because I have had a run of crappy servers lately, and all these girls were just great at chatting you up and being super friendly. I get that it is obviously the thing they have to do given that I am sure they are aiming for the biggest tips possible considering they are practically naked, but I really appreciated the very nice, but not in a fake way, service.   We were there for the late night happy hour (M-F starts at 9pm) and the prices were great! Shots (good ones!) were $3 and appetizers were half off. We ate and drank (a lot!) and the bill was under $50. I was also impressed with how many TV's they had, even a small personal one in each booth. I can imagine this will be a fun place to watch games.   The only reason I felt like I could only, give 3 stars is the food selection was pretty minimal and of the three appetizers we got (pretzels, queso and chips, and pulled pork nachos) the pulled pork nachos weren't that great. I think if they had maybe some regular or irish nachos, regular sliders (they just had pulled pork) and maybe quesadillas, it would be perfect, but that might just be my preference.   Even with the minimal menu, we will definitely be back. The girls and prices were great!!",

Me and a friend get there, and we tell them two of our friends will be there in a few minutes, and they will pay their $10 cover.  The hostess warns me they could sell off my seats if they need to.  Understandable, but considering there was a bunch of empty seats, we tried our luck.  Five minutes later they sell off one of our seats.  My fault, they did warn me, but for some reason I figured they would have some customer service and at least warn me, to give me a chance to buy the other two seats.  That wasn't really the problem, it was really my fault.  What's pretty annoying, is my friends do end up coming...and half the damn restaurant was empty the WHOLE night!  So you sat a stranger with us, when there was four empty tables next to us!  It seems like they were purposefully trying to give us a hard time for not paying the whole cover up front.  They're just pretty rude when it comes to these kind of events, and I'm definitely not going back to this location for a fight night.",

So can they at least fake the experience? It drives me nuts as someone who works in a tip based business to watch a server focus her attention on one party while ignoring everyone else.   Because I went alone, does my business count less? How does she know I won't tip better than a party of 3 combined?  Can't see myself ever going back, which is too bad because I had looked forward to trying this place out.",

We have had Kaitlin several times as our server and has always been on top of things.  The food has been pretty good too! This last time we ordered and shared a house salad, the blackened chicken quesadilla and the venison chili burger. The favorites for me were the fresh & crisp house salad and the quesadilla. The venison burger was good but I wasn't a fan of the chili on top of it.  In the past we've had the meaty wings, the Philly cheesesteak, Poblano Chicken as entrees. We've also had a large group here where we passed appetizers. The fried pickles, pork sliders & mozzarella sticks were all a big hit.   One of these times I'm going to get Mom's Pot Roast. The smell alone makes your mouth water.  As far as beverages, you can go wrong with a frozen mug of beer. My personal favorite is the Knotty Brunette. A great amber beer which you can get lady or man size.  Being this location has had the hardest time keeping occupants I'm glad to see something here that will stay for quite some time.",

    "text": "First of I'm kind of a needy guest. Having to wait for a napkin, silverware, or a drink refill is a pet-peave of mine. However, the waitress here are not sitting around at tables, they are running about for their customers. I don't drink much alcohol because most of the time I drink like a fish, so ice tea is my beverage of choice. It was full the entire time of my visit (thanks to my waitress). Be sure and ask for Kaitlynn. She kept her eye on all of her guests and is the perfect example of a great waitress. She has that instinct that only a few waitresses have for getting her customers what they want and in a quick way.    Now when it comes to the food, it is so tasty. Sports bar/restaurants are typically lacking when it comes to high quality meals. However, that's not the case at this Twin Peaks. I try something different almost every time I go there. The BBQ pulled pork nachos are to die for. The \"Mom's Pot Roast\" and the \"Chicken Fried Chicken\" is as closed to home cooking as it gets. One of those cooks must've spent a lot of time with his Mother growing up (kind of Mama's boy maybe, LOL, but, I'm glad), because his food kicks ass! But, back to the service, having Kaitlyn waiting on me is like the cherry on top of my favorite desert.   All in all, this place offers great food, fast service, kind waitress (who are absolutely 100% gorgeous,  wall to wall  sports on big screens and personal flat screens at the booths. This place is unlike any other place Hoo you may know. . The waitresses remind me of \"Heidi of the Swiss Alps\", and not raunchy. Honestly, I hate some of those other places Hoo have the wan-a-be waitresses come and put there chest in your face to take your order (and screw it up more often than not). Even your wife or girlfriend will like this restaurant. But, beware, it's the cooks in the back room she may not like, because the menus these cooks prepare are phenomenal, and nobody's going to want to eat at home any more.   Chow!",

She had characteristics of a drug addict and at one point didn't check on us for 45 minutes to an hour. Luckily we were chatting with friends.. it took us about 3 hours total to be served and complete the check.",

Kept our beer ice cold and checked on us at the best times! Good hire! Thanks Twin peaks! Btw the billionaires burgers with double party was the best choice ever & the twin peaks dirty blonde & twin peaks knotty brunette beer mixed was so fucking good blended!

That would be one of the house brews on tap served at below freezing temperatures.  There is a temp gauge at the entry that fluctuates around 27 to 29 degrees.  This indicates the temperature of the beer on tap. Yes, there are ice crystals in your beer that also arrives in a frosty stein. The staff is always flurtatious and helpful, which adds to the experience. The small menu offers some slightly different tasty treats. Hamburgers referred to as \"man burgers\" are tasty and fulfilling.  They also offer the biggest slab of chicken fried steak I've ever seen.  I have only enjoyed watching people try to eat this bohemith of a plate and haven't yet tried it. They offer the token bar food with some slight twists.  I haven't had a bad meal yet. The interior is adorned with huge racks.  I'm referring to the mounted antlers which are quite the display. There are many tvs to watch any sport that's playing at the time.  It's a cool place that will remain a mainstay in my places to hang out.",

Imagine giving them your Drivers license that has your name, address and date of birth.. And then later provide them with your credit card?? That's a recipe for fraud right there. So not safe.

She made sure to check in with us to be sure we had everything we needed.  Service was quick and the food choices were outstanding.  A nice variety.  We also were impressed that a manager, Drew, took the time to stop by our table to be sure that all was well. This is something that I haven't experienced at a lot of other restaurants.  I've worked in the retail/service industry for years, and I really appreciate it when I receive excellent service! I noticed that Drew also made it a point to talk customers at other tables.  This definitely was a nice touch to our lunch time, and I'll be back again!",

Ordered the Bacon burger, it was ok I guess not a whole lot of flavor, and not cooked to order which is a big turnoff.  Service was pretty slow for a place not too busy.  Not that I am a cheap ass but I asked for a side of bbq sauce for my fries and they charged 50 cents....and as Big Perm in the movie Friday said \"Its principalities Smokey!\".  but a big turn off from a chain eatery making money hand over fist.

Surprisingly I did not feel uncomfortable being one of the few female patrons there. Expect to see a lot of guys when you go there. I would not like to work there.   Okay let the review begin, my friend ordered the pulled pork sliders which I tried, pulled pork is supposed to be tender and juicy but the pork in the sliders tasted rubbery. My other friend ordered a quesadilla but there is no way you can mess up a quesadilla. Fries were decent and the draught beer list was alright as well.   This place is good to watch sports as they have big screen television surrounding the entire bar. The dining room was designed to give a cabin-like feel.",

We eat at this location often and occasionally when we are there after 10:00 pm on weekends we have the Indi card that gives us a 50% discount. We showed it to our waitress and she showed it to the manager. When our bill came they gave us 20% off. I said it was supposed to be 50% and she said that 20% was what the manager gave us. So she sent him over. He said they hadn't offered that deal in a long time, I informed him we used it just last week. He told us they shouldn't have and was very rude about it. His name is Scott and how ever got to be a GM is beyond me. The Indi card is a card available to those that work in the service industry. I've been involved in restaurants for over thirty years and this is the first time I've taken the time to leave a bad review about a person. Maybe he was having a bad day or maybe he's just miserable. Either way his customers service is possibly the worst I've ever seen.",

My wife's steak was cooked a little too much and could have used some more seasoning, but my salmon was delicious, and so were the side vegetables and appetizers (chips with quesadere and buffalo wings).  Our pino noir wine was a nice accompaniment with our dinner.  We were too full to try their deserts, but we left very satisfied.",

    "text": "You can find almost anything on Eastern Avenue including a couple of breastaraunts. Twin Peaks is one that is doing pretty well in a building that historically has not done well. The outstanding views, cold beers, and crystal clear televisions keep me coming back. Make sure you have full motion in your neck when you come in, because most likely your head will be on a swivel. It's starts when you come through the doors and you're greeted by what seems like an army of hostesses and continues throughout your meal as the servers stroll on by.  I mostly come for lunch and occasionally on Monday nights. The log cabin themed restaurant is huge with plenty of seating. Don't expect to be blown away by the food, it's standard bar fare. I've actually had almost all of the menu. I think the post roast is good and the soft pretzel is good to snack on and there's enough to share. This last visit, I had the BELT which I enjoyed because of the fried egg and the toasted sourdough bread. Props to our server Amanda, who saw that my sandwich was ready way before my buddies chicken tacos and burger were ready, so she had the kitchen remake my sandwich so that it would be ready at the same time as everyone else's food.  The servers have always been friendly to us and we've never had problems getting in and out during our lunch hour. The beer selection is average but the beers are cold and always served in frozen mugs. If you're drinking slow, you're sure to drench your table top as the ice on the mugs melts. If your eyes make it up to the television screens, you'll see many large, clear HD screens set to your favorite sporting event.  Twin Peaks is a nice change of pace in our rotation of bars. Certain dishes on the menu are better than others. But I'll keep coming back for the cold beers and the views.",

Items ordered were a gigantic soft pretzel with a yummy beer-cheese dipping sauce and mustard, buffalo wings, grilled chicken sandwich with grilled poblano, side salad. Everything was very good. Our multiple waitresses, each scantily clad with either a lumberjack or rockabilly short shorts and push-up bra, we're all very friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere is noisy, to be expected of a sports bar. Would I return? Possibly, I love a good soft pretzel.",

I dont understand why I just walk into establishments not looking it up first lol  My server was..D... something. D.... damnit.. I'm so bad with names but she has a tribal tat on her arm lol. I'm calling her DD. Anyway.. DD was great and got me my drinks, took my order and all my food came out relatively fast. D squared, you're awesome. Service on point.  The food was great, DD recommended the bacon burger for people who loves them some MeaT. Flavorful, messy, aggressive.. just how it's supposed to be. Smashed that burger in less than 5 mins.. because I'm a man.  The side order of mozzarella cheese sticks were also good but they both came out at once and I just couldn't finish all of it.  Overall there was nothing to complain about. Servers are great, food is good and the price really wasnt that bad at all.. I'll come back if I ever come back to Vegas.",

My friend and I sat down and we were immediately ask for a drink orders. It was happy hour and not too busy. Surprising, because it's the day before 4th of July. My friend and I couldn't decide between a burger or the turkey avocado sandwich. When we asked for both , they offered to split both meals between the two of us. They literally made the two meals, cut them in half, put them on separate plates and gave them to us like that so we could share! I've never had a restaurant offer to do that before.     I do like to come here for the beer, because it is extremely cold. It's like Hooters, but with better beer and better food. There's a TV on every wall each with a different channel so you will be sure to not miss any sports game going on.  This place has definitely earned one of my top 5 places in Vegas.",

    "text": "Out of all the breastaurant options out there, Twin Peaks is my champ as they are the most consistent in what they do well..  Twin Peaks Service:  Consistently good throughout my visits, the servers have always been friendly and great with checking back at the table.  I've never had to worry about getting another drink filled and everyone is upbeat which brings a good vibe. The kitchen gets the food out pretty quickly as well.  A couple of years, we did our fantasy football draft in the booths and they were all good about it.  They had outlets to plug our laptops in and we parked, drafted and drank for hours. Excellent  Twin Peaks Cuisine:  This is definitely bar food land, so stick to what they do best: burgers, chicken Wings, nachos, etc..  Salads and soups have been hit or miss with me.  The Hangover burger is my #1 burger here and fish and chips also work.  Be realistic of what you're ordering in your environment and all will be well.  The beers always get served Ice Cold.  I always order beer here (vs cocktails) on this alone.  Twin Peaks Ambiance:  The decor, server uniforms shoots for this mountain log cabin vibe and it works.  There's an awesome overkill of monitors and big screens to watch sporting events.  The rectangular main bar is huge and is stocked with everything you need to get your booze on.  If you have an issue with the servers being all female, wearing very short khaki shorts and tie up flannel shirts that expose the bare midriff, Twin Peaks is probably not for you.  Twin Peaks provides good: service, drinks, and basic bar foods to snack on.   The monitors makes it a great place for sporting events.  To expect anything else is unrealistic.  See you at the bar, cheers! =)",

There is no way it takes almost 45 minutes to prepare a meal when the place was basically empty besides the people drinking at the bar! The lady FINALLY brings my food out and sits it in front of me and walks off. No thank you, no offer to wait for me to check my order and no invitation to see if I needed anything else. The attitude of the chick at the bar was just as funky as the skanky outfits they wear! The chicken fried chicken was pretty good, but the fries were old and stale. I wouldn't go back here if they have me free food for a year. The service is poor, perhaps that's why it was so empty in there on a Saturday evening!",

Very beautiful! Anyways, I ordered a beer and salmon. A few minutes later, Jennifer came over and dropped over a folded napkin and apologize. She let me know that they ran out of coasters and napkins. How is that possible?!?! In a restaurant??? Anyways, I'm writing this review because of this. A very small gesture but it was very sweet of her to do so. If you don't know, Twin peaks is known for having the coldest beer. So when the mug start to defrost, where's the excess water going to go??? On the table. For Jennifer to think outside the box and think that far ahead and improvise when supplies were out.... that's excellent customer service and going above and beyond ! Amazing server, will be back and request her again.",

    "text": "It seems that come fight night this is the place to be BUT the service fails miserably. My friends and I came in for the McGregor fight this past weekend. TP usually charges $10, but on this night it was $20. A standing room only event. TP should come w/ a disclaimer on fight nights, especially on the bigger cards, 'your order will more than likely come out wrong, at least twice'.  Our server was nice enough to tell us that the kitchen and bar were backed up at least 10 minutes. That allowed us to order differently than we would normally order so we didn't have to wait as long to get things. On this night though just about everything we ordered came out wrong or didn't come out at all.   The food runner was bringing the wrong food to the wrong table at various times throughout the night. The drinker runner didn't know what she had in her hand. That's either because she was told incorrectly by the bartender or because she forgot from that long walk of 20 feet from the bar to our table.   I ordered a whiskey neat (just alcohol in a glass) at one point and the server brought it to me a glass w/ a large ball of ice in it. I let her know this is not neat. She came back and it was now in a rock glass, but not a double as originally ordered. It was as if they strained it into the glass and said 'here ya go'. Then other times the drink runner was saying the drink was something else than what we ordered so it was sent back. Then it would be brought back because our server intercepted her. This would happen at least 4 more times in the night. At one point the girl shrugged because she honestly didn't know what the drinks were so she had to go back to the bar to find out what the bartender just told her what they were.   We ordered soup later in the night and it came out cold. The wings that were ordered, one set was the wrong flavor. Another item ordered never even came out.   Just crazy how many mistakes occurred in one night. Not a huge fan of this place when it comes to service and getting things right regardless of how busy an establishment is. It was as if it was everyone's first night on the job.",

    "text": "Went to this place for the first time with a friend this week. I was curious to see what it was all about after seeing it on Undercover Boss. The owner is a former CEO (or some kind of top office guy) of Hooters, so that explains the theme a lot.   When we went, a reality show was being recorded. That made things interesting. The waitresses here are super hot, so that helps with the ambiance. :)  Our server, and sorry I didn't catch her name, was super cool and attentive. She really knows how to make you feel welcome with being super nice and professionally flirty. You can tell it was part of her job, and I am in no position to complain. She knows why guys come here and does her job well in order to make a good tip. She had the perfect balance of the attention she gave. Nothing too extreme and nothing too light.  The food was ok. The garlic parmesan chicken wings were the best. The chicken tenders were bland, and that's coming from a guy who just recently returned to eating meat after being vegetarian for ten years. But like Hooters, you aren't really coming here for the food, now are you? ;)  At the end of the day, the atmosphere, huge TVs everywhere and one at your table, and the hot ladies make it an ideal destination for the bros to come and hang out, participate in a little friendly flirtation, enjoy decent food and catch a sports game. I will be a repeat offender, but just know that these ladies are here to do a specific job. Get you to spend money and tip big, in which I did. Don't get chocolate wasted and think you have a shot with any of them. Treat them like the professionals they are. Enjoy the time and what this place has to offer. I can only imagine what this place is like during big sporting events. Probably packed! Keep doing what you're doing, Twin Peaks. I'm not mad. lol! :)",

    "text": "I have been in search of 3 things in this town.   1. Good Service  2. Better tasting food then my friends or I can cook at home.  3. And a final bill that is in line with the entire experience.  Well after my visit to Twin Peaks on Eastern I can easily say I'm still searching! Let me first say that this review is a little late because I just haven't found the time to sit down and really let this place have a full JT review. I would say we visited this,\" Health Department Disaster Waiting to Happen\" place in early March 2014. If I remember right it was a Sunday.   We arrived at what looked like a packed parking lot but for whatever reason none of the cars belonged to the people in Twin Peaks itself. In fact the place was kind of empty, save for the 6 or 7 tables filled with Sun Cities finest.   At the door we were greeted by a great looking girl who had a nice smile. She quickly asked us where we would prefer to sit and guided us to the outdoor area. Being that it was March we were taking a gamble that the weather would be acceptable to sit in. But after seeing a few other groups outside we figured we would be OK.   The Service After sitting down we began to take the place in as it was our first time at the nationwide chain. The bar was centrally located and looked like it was getting ready for the lunch rush. The girls were making their rounds to the folks at the tables in teams. And in general the place looked clean and nice. We sat around for a good 7 to 8 minutes before one of the teams of girls asked if we had been helped. We said no and she asked if she could get our drink order. I ordered a Miler Lite in the \"Man size\". Another 8 to 9 minutes later we watched as multiple girls walked by my beer on the end of the bar without grabbing it and bringing it over. A full 20 minutes later our waitress Candice made her way to us. She was visibly out of sorts over something and told us it was \"kitchen drama\" . I asked if she could find out where my beer was and then we would order. She made a face like the beer order was news to her and she quickly went looking for it. Once she came back we ordered. I ordered the chicken fingers and my girlfriend ordered the chicken sandwich.  Now that our order was in we returned to looking at the chaos that was happening in the restaurant. We observed the girls talking in groups for minutes while customers raised their hands to get their attention. It was comical to observe how the girls would walk by a table and completely ignore the people who were trying to get their attention. We noticed that the table next to us finally receiving their food only to have just about half the order taken back. We later learned that all the food was either cooked wrong or completely not what they ordered. We laughed together as we made fun of this awful place. I could have sworn that we were on a hidden camera show where the experiment was to see how we would react to super slow / terrible service. The manager, if you could call him that, was completely glamored by the cute girls. He was walking around in a daze. It was clear the girls run this place from start to finish. However, it was all fun and games until our food arrived and things got real.  The Food A good hour into our experience the food arrived. I looked over to the table that was still waiting for its order and said, \"I hope this was worth the wait\" they laughed and we started eating.  My chicken fingers looked horrible. They were white and looked to be uncooked. I dipped the first one in the sauce and took a bite. Just then my girlfriend asked me,\"What's this?\" as she pointed to the thumb of a rubber glove! I spit out what food was in my month and said, \"Don't eat that!\" At this time our neighbors, at the table where the food was all wrong, started to flag over the incompetent manager. We motioned over to them that after they were done we wanted to talk with him. They decided that our problem was more important so they let us have him first. He and our out of touch waitress came over to our table. Both of them just looked in disbelief that such a thing could happen. I quickly figured out that these 2 low intelligent people would never be able to correct what had just happened and that it would be a complete waste of my time to complain to someone who was obviously powerless. Therefore, I looked the dimwit in the face and said we were done, and that we were leaving and never coming back. He just stood there and drooled on himself. Candice had a similar look on her face and confessed that she couldn't work there anymore as she gave my girlfriend an awkward hug.   The Bill Well needless the say... this one was on the house!  After sharing our experience with just about everyone with ears we knew, it became clear that this chain was known for bad food, and bad service. Our friends in Phoenix and Orlando said this place was awful!!  I can only hope this review stops enough people from going here and they are forced to close.!!",

By the time we were seated, it became immediately clear that the title had nothing to do with actual mountains or the great outdoors. The service was friendly and pleasant, though the server did ask me \"What does hoppy mean?\" when I asked her what the hoppiest beer on tap was. The food isn't great, and the beer taps are average. The BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos were something fiercely awful - Guy Fieri is probably kicking himself that he doesn't have it featured in his restaurants. To their credit, there are tons of televisions around to watch whatever sports are on (yippee).  Ultimately, the selling points for this place are the massive amounts of televisions and the scenery that only a heterosexual male with no greater sense of appetite can enjoy. The service seemed friendly enough, but the food was bleh.",

I pointed out to our bar server that we weren't there for the Bikinis, but for the Hockey....still had to pay the money!!!  We paid, as we wanted to carry on watching the game.   For nearly 80 minutes the Bikini contest went on, the mic feeding back so badly it started to hurt my ears.  An attraction like that should be kept to 60 minutes. Drunk people attention span isn't that long !!!   I work in sound and I offered a solution to both the bartender (not interested!!) and I even grabbed the manager. He told me that he had already mentioned it to the DJ. It would have been a simple solution of reducing the mic level, or the treble. Nothing was done and it carried on squealing back continuously.   Seriously, If your DJ can't deal with simple mic issues like that, he should give up and find another career.   Between the 2 of us we spent over 100$, we would have been happy to go back for the remainder of the playoffs, but will now go to Buffalo Wild Wings instead.   Food was Ok, drinks kept flowing. The place was busy, but if they want to keep it that way, sort out tech issues.   I'm writing this 2 hours after leaving and my ears are still hurting!!!",

Burgers and sandwiches...and not even a lot of choices for burgers and sandwiches.  I had a bbq burger which was okay.  Overcooked a little bit.  The fries it came with were nice thick steak fries though.  I love steak fries.  The thing is....you can get a similar burger and fries down the road at red robin for cheaper and with better service.  Sure, Red Robin has screaming kids and less pretty waitresses, but it's still a better experience I think.",

I was honestly impressed that they were as attentive as they were. The manager came out and waited on us which was super nice of her to do. Overall aside from all the cigs that were out front I must say that I really enjoyed my experience there and look forward to coming again. It was our first time. The girls were really hot too so that was a plus. But the food was good and we were both stuffed beyond stuffed. Keep up the good work ladies looking forward to seeing you again soon I hope.",

There were about 10 other people there. It took a solid 5 minutes to be greeted. Once we ordered our food, she read back the wrong order. We corrected her, and the food still came out wrong.   The second time we went with another couple. Again, our server was super sweet, but knew nothing about beer (asked us what a wheat beer is). And, once again, our food came out incorrectly.   It's a great atmosphere. Nice, open space. TVs everywhere (and I mean everywhere). Not too loud. But the service has GOT to get better. I have a feeling they hired a lot of girls with zero service experience, which is fine. But you've got to train them not only on beer basics, but how to take an order correctly.",

Well, they have a lot of work to do if they want my business back. So disappointing.  Decided to plan a going away function from my job the week they opened. A friend and coworker (yes we are in the industry) called in advance and spoke to the manager who told her that there was nothing we could do, it was first come first serve. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if a large party of industry professionals want to go there, spend a lot of money, and have a good time, you should probably make an accommodation.   When we arrived they ended us giving us the whole patio area which was a nice gesture. It was a chilly evening but there is a fireplace so we took that so we could all be together. We had a great night up until the end when we were settling the bills. Obviously this was a complicated process because there were so many of us, but in the beginning of the night, they assured us that everything was fine and we would just take care of it at the end. There was about $60 that was not accounted for. My boyfriend (a restaurant manager) spoke to their manager who basically said: \"somebody's gotta pay for it!\". Not the correct solution sir. Especially because I'm almost positive that the check in question was paid for at the bar. Apologize, take your $60 loss and make us happy so you don't receive reviews like this.   My boyfriend emailed their customer service department the next day and has still not received a response. Not good for building a loyal customer base. Good luck!",

Alienating 50 percent of the population with SIT2P bathrooms and terrible service to females as evidenced by many Yelp reviews in other cities -- not smart!   Ok I got accused of being jealous by a fellow Yelper.  Not True- there are lots of places with sexy gals that I love (PT's Gold, Treasures ;) but you also need to be a good bartender!  If you don't know where Firestone beer is from or where you get the venison in the chili from you are just eye candy.  There is nothing wrong with being sexy but if this is a dining spot and not a strip club then act like it!!  Food and service was worse than Hooters - I didn't know that was possible.  You don't really come to a place like this for anything but the girls. Unimpressed.  Grapes on a celery.  No curves :(  Arkansas Times agrees with me.  Epic bad.  They called it, \"The worst most apathetic swill I've ever eaten.\"  Ha ha ha yep!",

We walk in and were sat quickly, but once we sat down we were completely IGNORED, NOT helped once, and not even acknowledged. Multiple waitresses walked past us, seeing our menus sitting out, no drinks, no hello. After waiting from 5:30 to 5:45, we decided it was time to call it quits and walk out. Upon approaching the hostess stand, the hostess and another waitresses were standing there talking. Clearly mistakes were made in the seating, but no one made any effort to rectify the situation. Mind you, the place was not busy whatsoever either. Very annoyed. Very frustrated.",

    "text": "I literally just received garbage for service. My boyfriend and I went in after a golden knights game to get a bite. We sit down on the end, wait 5 mins and a girl comes over and immediately she says \"do you guys know what you want\" mind you we don't even have a menu in front of us. No hi, no how are you, no welcome in, nothing. So we get the menu, order drinks and were not even given the option of size of beers. The bartender Ravin brings over our check, with no drinks and proceeds to ask if we want appetizers. We ordered fried pickles. A few mins later our drinks arrive from another girl. Before our pickles come out we order other food and she asked 2 times the modification i wanted on my burger because she didn't write it down. The pickles came out and were a dinner size portion with half a ramekin of ranch. We found pieces of fried chicken in the mix of our pickles, I'm vegetarian so that was a nice surprise. We still have no utensils. Our food comes out, it looks to be what we ordered. Ravin walks over and gives us utensils, and my boyfriend said \"Thank you\" and she gives us a thumbs up. We were never asked how to food was, and if we needed anything else. We put down a credit card while still eating because we knew it might take 30 mins before she actually got to swiping the card. We are both bartenders in this town. This service was actually crap and we always tip way above average. First time in my life I wanted to tip absolutely nothing but still gave her 15%. I will never come back again and will never suggest this place to anyone. I would give 0 stars if I could but maybe the 1 star accounts for the food being some what edible.",

    "text": "We just left this sorry excuse for a restaurant. We entered and ask for a table on the patio , the host checks it comes back and tells us she has to clean it off , ok no problem. But first she has to go in the back get a rag clean it , then put the rag away and then come sit us, all this while there is another girl at the host stand that never looks up at us let alone say hello and she is wiping down menus.this should of been our first sign. We get seated, waitress doesn't come over for at least 5 minutes. She was very pleasant , takes our drink orders and that's when it started to go down hill. We order a beer and a wine , some wings and some steaks nachos. It was the beginning of the 5th inning when we ordered, we didn't get our drinks until the bottoms of the 6 th , she comes finally and apologized for the wait. Now for the food , it finally comes, the nachos were literally cold , the steak included. The pile of guacamole on the plate was brown on the outside like it was sittting on the line all that time. Waitress is nowhere in sight so we stop another employee, she apologized and says so many people called out and there was only two people in the kitchen. Ok I get it but why can't I find my waitress either. During this whole time now our drinks are empty and have been for awhile. We decide we are just going to get the check and go. Our waitress finally shows up , asks if we are ok.  I tell her no and we need the check. She brings the wrong check first time around then finally comes back with the right check and says \"sorry but you came on a busy night \". What ??? , maybe I should get there schedule and find out what nights they are slow so we can go then. I don't think so , actually I will never be back to this place and would never recommend    11/30/18-  so I posted this first review at least a little over a month ago. Shortly after it posted to yelp the Mgr from twin peaks asked me to email her so we could talk about my experience. I did email her immediately and to this day I have not heard a thing from them. This just confirms my decision to never patronize this establishment or to ever recommend it to friends , Family, or even enemies",

We are somewhere between Colorado and a strip club.   9 months pregnant and feeling like a blown up cow probably wasn't the best idea to come walking into here. Of course the ladies were nice and kept saying I looked tiny. Bonus points for that.   Walking in the hostess and waitresses, eh I mean snow bunnies (as it said on the sign) were wearing bikinis and very friendly. Def the place to come if your a guy with your guys friends. Don't come here if your the super jealous time. I am quite content with my relationship and had no problem with the half naked snow bunnies. They actually were cute. I mean, if you got it flaunt it. What I didn't like was that I felt we got less attention and service than the table next to us. The table was five guys drooling over the woman serving them. She would deliver their food or beers and then spend five to ten minutes talking to them. I get it to a degree but I don't like that we asked for a refill on our beers and waited 15 minutes. We had to ask a second time and then get her attention for our bill.   The decor was very cool. I'm way into deer antlers and the rustic look. We even have a deer wall in our living room. The food was good. Reasonable prices and specials. I had the breakfast sandwich. I downed it and asked for grilled onions on it.   This place was mediocre due to the inattentive snow bunnies.",

    "text": "Jeesh, I'm so late in trying out Twin Peaks, but better late than never! Of the two comparable restaurants (Hooters and Tilted Kilt), Twin Peaks definitely comes out as the winner!   Of course, the restaurant is themed, so it's all deer antlers and rustic wood, with the cute eye candy waitresses wearing khaki short shorts and low cut plaid shirts. Lots of tvs around and a personal tv at the booths, so definitely a good spot to watch sports.  The menu is small, just expect the standard bar food and you'll be ok. They also have a pretty big selection of beers on tap. I'm not really a beer drinker, but I was talked into getting a man sized blonde something or another, and I actually finished it! Yay me!   The food was surprisingly good, though! We had the fried pickles for an app, and the batter was perfect- not too much, right amount of seasoning, nicely fried, served hot. Really probably the best fried pickles I've had. I had a sampler of the fried chicken sliders served on a biscuit (1 slider = $2). I didn't even know that was an option, but our cute waitress told us. It was pretty good, the biscuit was a tad dry and crumbly, but I liked the cream gravy on it.  My Hangover burger was great! They don't ask how you'd like it cooked, I believe they are prepared medium well done. It was juicy, meaty, tasty- the bacon was amazing, and the egg really added to it. I enjoyed the fries as well, just a little crunch on the outside, nice and soft in the middle, and served hot.   Twin Peaks, i may climb a mountain (or at least a small hill) to reach you! Worth the trek to Henderson for sure!",

Just about every other 1-2 seats at the bar was occupied. The atmosphere is pretty cool and my husband liked most of the beers they had to choose from. The service however was pretty terrible. Two female bartenders were serving and each time we asked for a drink it took about 20-30 minutes to get a drink or just their attention. At one point we simply asked for chips and salsa. After waiting for about 40 minutes for the chips and salsa, we asked again for the order. The bartender stated the order was never put in, offered a half apology and finally put the order in. I'm not sure if we were given poor service because I was a female there with my husband, and they just prefer to spend all of their time and attention to male customers only, but we won't be back. My husband usually likes going here and even he was really disapponted with the service. I would have liked to come back for dinner one day, but maybe not after this experience.",

The manager cam over and told up he didn't appreciate our attitude. I told him they weren't very busy and should had been able to handle our order. Bad went to horrible, the manager wouldn't let up and said we hurt the servers feelings because we cursed. By this time, we'd been there over an hour and just wanted to leave.

I was more interested in the food but it was a great sports bar overall. TV's everywhere, nice casual environment, and we had an awesome server who was very attentive. So the main reason I would recommend to visit is because they have the perfect burger located here. Tried their avocado smash burger with bacon (smash I did when it arrived) I almost shed a tear on how perfect it was all around. Besides the fact that I got it medium rare, it had the right amount of ingredients to bring out the best flavor and looked like the artist/chef really was trying to create a masterpiece. Hell even chef Ramsay would say, \"that's one bloody good burger now teach me how to make it so I can put it in my f$&@ing restuarant.\" Not only did I tip the server well but the chef as well. Definitely impressed. Will be back when I visit Las Vegas again.",

Prices are moderately fair for the portion sizes. The restaurant itself is nice and sporty. If you request a booth you get a little personal T.V. The atmosphere is definitely directed more to men. You'll find out why when you get there, lol.",

The beer is served in really cold mugs; they have to be at a certain temperature so they come out nice and icy. That first sip tastes refreshing as fuhhh.  My friend says the food here is really good too but I haven't tried it yet. This place is basically like a Hooters-cabin-restaurant-sports bar. Plenty of men seem to come here for obvious reasons. Not a bad spot to chill though. Gotta love the ice cold beer though!",

The entire management team should change careers. Your staff is horrid. They have zero customer service skills, and are massively unfriendly. We attended a large gathering for a birthday celebration, and the whole group was disappointed. Several people in our group are servers and bartenders, so we know how to be good patrons. I tipped $10 on a $70 bill. I NEVER EVER tip that little, and it should have been zero. Aren't you guys embarrassed?? No pride whatsoever!",

    "text": "First visit definitely surprised tonight; surprise in a good way! Thank you Tyres for your awesome, personable, honest customer service! I will be sure to request your section next time I come in!   So hubby and I walked in towards the last half of the Seahawks/Vikings game. We knew we wanted to go out to watch the Warriors Game, and they sat us in a nice corner table right in front of the many huge televisions throughout the establishment. Loved that!   Our server, Tyres came by to greet us at and take our drink/appetizer order. She's super sweet- again if you come in request her section; she'll take care of ya!   For foods tonight we tried the following:  1) 6 piece baked wings with spicy garlic sauce on the side. 4 stars, the wings are tiny, yet flavorful. The spicy garlic sauce is on point, so good I glazed my ribeye with the extra sauce. 6/$8.69   2) salmon $14.99/ this was really good! Cuts like butter and full of flavor paired with sweet potatoes and a corn hash. Yummy!   3) 13 oz. Ribeye $24.99. I think this is over priced, but at least the steak was cooked right; nice pink juicy center at medium rare. The steak sat atop a bed of steamed asparagus and you can taste the parsley/garlic butter throughout the dish.   For dessert we tried the bread pudding that came with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream. I don't know how we managed to eat a couple scoops of this because I was so super full. But I'm so glad I was able to fit it in because this bread pudding is divine.   Overall great 1st experience. Although this place was super sausage fest when we walked in, the workers are friendly. Don't let there uniform scare or intimidate you. *wink.",

No one left while we stood at the front so they were open all along.

The food was OK for the price, nothing which makes me want to run back, but wasn't a complete rip-off like I feel Hooters is.  Service was friendly and our waitress refilled my drink several times without me having to ask.  They have a \"first come, first serve\" event line-up for fights with reasonable cover, however the hostess said it gets really crowded and you aren't guaranteed a seat.  I can't imagine- the bathroom was pretty small, it must get pretty gross when it's busy.",

We ordered the fried pickle appetizer which was perfect and one if not the best we had ever eaten. Kat returned with our drinks, took our meal order and we requested that the blaring music be turned down. Amazingly, they did and we were able to converse without shouting. Our food as ordered arrived in less than 15 minutes. The chicken fried steak, though thin was cooked perfectly. The shrimp and chicken,  prepared in a light batter, was great. Our only complaint, which management addressed, was the unnecessarily loud music.",

When I got up to look for a manager all there waitress where taking pictures in the middle of busy hrs. The waitress only helped the people that where hugging them or had there hand on there asses. I have come to this place many times and never been treated like this, yes maybe my order was a little wrong in the pasted, but 5 different waitress walked by and never even said a word to us. I went down the Street to PT's and got way better service and food. I don't recommend this place feel like they are running a prostitution ring then a restaurant.",

I had to deal with a server that cared more about giving me a fake smile and trying to be flirty to myself and my two buddies that were with me instead of knowing the menu or what beers they have. I ask for a Guinness so the server ask if I want it big boy size. I didn't know what that was but a lot of beer sounded good me so I said yes. She comes back to tell me they only have it in the bottle. So I say that's fine. And what do I get, a can of Guinness. At this point I'm already disappointed. Then we ordered our food. I got the chicken tenders. Which I recommend by the way. But I asked for ranch and never got it. And I never was able to ask for some because the servers seem to only stay at tables that seem to flirt back in hope of getting a good tip. So I never got my ranch but was charged for it. The only thing that made my experience good at twin peaks was my buddies and beer that made me forget about the place.",

The place is pretty noisy and hard to have a conversation even in a booth with the person across the table.  The server Kat came to our table very quickly and took our drink order.    I ordered a Cazadores Margarita on the rock with salt rim...which came extremely shaken to the point that it was foamy.  Kinda odd.  We ordered the Pork sliders with side of tomato soup, the Smokehouse Burger and Fries.  The place wasn't very busy but the food took at least 20-30 minutes.  When the order finally came to the table...the pork in the sliders looked like they scraped the last of the pulled pork that was overdone from cooking all day.  The fries were old and cold.  As the server asked us if there was anything else we needed...we told her about the fries which she took away promptly.  Half way through the burger the manager came to our table and asked how everything was.  We told him about the fries and how long it has been and he quickly went to the kitchen and came back immediately with fresh fries.   I didn't finish my 3rd of 3 sliders, tomato soup was very mediocre, and my wife didn't eat the other half of the burger because it was so greesy and the bun was now wet.    Other than the nice and very beautiful servers...this place is horrible.  Bad Food and Poor Drinks.  Why spend $$ on a bad experience.  We will not return.",

I could only finish about 1/4 of it and took the rest home.  I would prefer smaller portions and better quality. The potatoes were buried under the steak and were on the dry side but with decent flavor.  The beer, served girly size or man size, was just ok.  I do like the TV's at the booths and for a place that is designed to attract customers for the waitresses rather than the food, my expectations were low to begin with.

They have to tell you verbally WTF! Be warned...  Girls are pretty but NOT helpful.  Like the place better before the menu change!",

Waked in and was face to face with two girls at the Hostess stand having a personal conversation that was clearly more important than two hungry customers with cash to spend on food and lots of beer.  Finally got sat...one, two, three times the waitress passed by without so much as an acknowledgement.  So we pulled aside one of the many girls not doing anything and asked if she could help.  She couldn't.  But, she got us a different girl who also said she couldn't help, but, would \"find our waitress.\"  17 minutes passed without even a drink order taken.  We even stared right at the manager with desperate, hungry, thirsty faces to no avail.  18 minutes in we left and went to Pin Kow where we are always welcome!  I wonder if our waitress even ever came?  LOL.",

    "text": "Alright. My first time here and it was different. I anticipated the menu to consist of  variety of wings, I was wrong. I guest I stereotyped it with hooters lol.  What we ordered: Chicken wings as appetizer Smokehouse Burger Chicken and Shrimp baskets A dirty blonde (essentially a blue moon)  The food was impressively delicious. Wings had good sauce, baskets with the chicken were really really good and the fries were addicting with whatever seasoning was on them. My cousin who I usually has a problem finishing his food, just killed his burger. It looked tasty.  Update: Got a better server and had a good time with great food.   The service just kills my rating. This waitress, very sweet but had to be her first day. Took a while to get the drinks.Ok, not biggie but it wasn't too packed. We ordered the food and we received just chicken tenders and no shrimp. She returned the baskets to the back which she ended up returning them to us and saying these are on the house and we will make you a new basket with the correct food. Okay thats nice, also the manager came and apologized and told us to about the mishap. Fine, however after this our waitress just about disappeared on us and the table behind us. Had to flag her down for napkins multiple times and to get out check. It was too much of a hassle.  Food was great, nice people I just wished this waitress was trained a bit better. I will be back as the food was great, in hopes of a better trained waitress and posting a new review.",

The service is really friendly and welcoming, i went with my husband and a friend and we all agree you pay for the view ( that is their concept), The food is just bar food a little too expensive. We did loved the beer, it is cold and they have good selection. If you just want to go to get a really cold beer and have a good time with friends you will be fine, just don't expect the best food for the prices in their menu. Last thing, this place will be awesome for football season! their screens are awesome!! So saying that i will give 4 stars because of the screens, beers and friendly staff, but only 2 stars for the food!! so yay i am a fan when i go to get some beers and football!",

I think...was fantastic, as were all the beautiful young ladies that helped us & posed w/our guys! My moscow mule was refreshing, but since I was driving I drank more water than mule. We ordered the cheese bites, chips & queso, burgers, phillies, salad, and a turkey smash. We had a *small issue* w/1 of our apps, tho. Seemed a plastic cap to something fell in the deep fryer w/1 off our cheese bites? My vegetarian friend chewed it for a bit before she realized it wasnt cheese! I've personally worked in food / bev & know stuff happens. The gf it happened to is a mom & nurse, so she wasn't thrilled...but hey, it was a small blip on an otherwise GREAT experience. Our server informed the manager. Who came to apologize & let us know they'd remove that particular item from our bill. Which was very nice. Thanks Twin Peaks for a great time! Our guys loved \"the view\"!",

There is no server in sight.  Then a table of 2 gentlemen get seated right next to us... Well... The server magically appears.

You'll never wait for a drink refill, and just about everyone who walks by checks on you.   If you're looking to catch a game, they have a ton of TVs. There are even booths with personal TVs.

Food is fine for a sports bar.    I haven't been to the other locations, but would be interested in seeing the indoor rock wall.    No major complaints... food is a little generic but service was great!",

    "text": "This place is great!  At first I was pretty surprised at the overall rating, but after reading the reviews, I understand. I think most of the negative reviews are from people who say \"I get the concept but...\" and actually DON'T get the concept. I've been here twice. Both times with a buddy to watch sports and have drinks while snacking on bar food. Mission accomplished. We weren't there to judge a beauty pageant or compare it to Hooters (although every girl is a 10!). We weren't expecting a 5 star Michelin meal. We weren't there to get their mixologist's latest handcrafted cocktail. I do think the beer selection and prices could be improved. I also don't like how cold the beer is served. Then again, to each their own. I work at a brewery, so I'm not looking for an ice cold Bud Light.  The bartender was happy to pour their Ballast Point IPA in a non-chilled glass for me though.   Management was more than appeasing. During my visit on Opening Day for baseball, my buddy and I wanted the TVs changed more often than I'm sure they liked, but they did that for us. Randy also charged my phone for me!    The service was great. I've been to plenty of bars and never have I gone expecting white tablecloth service or for my server/bartender to know how many years distilled their vodka is or from which farm their chicken was raised. What I didn't expect was for my server from my first visit to recognize me when she saw me the next time I came in. Kudos!  I do hope they add some more craft beers and get away from serving the beer so cold. Adding a happy hour would definitely bring me back (as well as other people in the industry) more often. I'd like to see them get the sports packages as well. Vegas is very diverse, so there are sports fans from all over who want to watch their hometown team.   I hope this place stays and does well!",

I give 2 less points because of the horribly loud music. I couldn't even hold a conversation in this place. It's a whole lot of screaming and only hearing half of what the person is saying.  The girls are almost too cheerful, but are very sweet. Their tops are too revealing, but clearly it's what the \"boys\" that come here want to see. It's sad.... There are also too many tv's. It's just about all a person can do in this place is watch it, because you won't hear anyone speaking at your table.  I would come back here. The other food looks like it has potential. I wish I could give 3.5 stars :)",

    "text": "Cold beer on a on a hot day?  I can dig it.    Located on Eastern right next to BJ's (thank goodness this spot has finally found an establishment that'll probably stick around; so many restaurants have come and gone through this place!), Twin Peaks is everything you can expect from a bar (hence why I'm giving it 5 stars, I don't expect too much from places like these lol)--boobies, beer, bar food, and TVs.  What more can you ask for?  I've only tried their appetizers, which are half off during happy hour, and they're actually pretty tasty.  The quesadilla and hot wings are great!  Other than that, there's really nothing spectacular about the food.  My favorite thing about this place has got to be all about the beer--it's worthy of 5 stars in my opinion--especially when you've been walking around outside in triple digit weather.  The beer is served so cold, that snow flurries ice over at the top of the mug.   Service is cool.  The place hasn't been open too long so service is kinda so-so.  The chick that served us one day thought it was happy hour, so we ordered a bunch of appetizers, thinking it was half-off, but at the end of the meal, she comes back, apologizes, and said she forgot that it wasn't actually happy hour, and we were forced to pay full price. Boo. Whatever.  They're all chicks (which may be a good or bad thing lol), dressed in super short shorts and tiny tops that expose a whole lotta skin and cleavage (think Hooters or the Tilted Kilt).  The ambiance is set to look like a log cabin, with deer and bear heads on the walls.  My only qualm about the place is that the beer selection is not as big as I would have liked it to be, but hey, I'll take a \"Man size\" of their \"Naughty Brunette\" any day.",

When we arrived at the restaurant the building looked big, and had a very  cool look to it.   When we went inside we were greeted by a gal, and that's when I remembered what they told me regarding the uniforms. Yup the uniforms were all matching! Lol, and ok they were half naked but I mean you see worse at Wal-Mart right? ...no? Ok, in all seriousness I wouldn't take my little kids to eat there as this for sure is an older crowd kind of place.  Ok, now the good part....the food! It was Good!   I was really surprised, I mean it was really good! I had the wings in mild sauce and I have to say that they were some of the best wings I've had in Vegas. Perfectly cooked, and great taste.   I would definitely recommend this place if you want to have good food, and some drinks as there bar is fully stocked. The service was good, and the waiting time was reasonable.

Our voluptuous waitress, Milana, made it clear to us what the restaurant name means, (hint: it had NOTHING to do with the scoops of vanilla ice cream on the sundae!)  In any case, she was as good as she was gorgeous, and turned us onto a couple of REDONKULOUS IPA's; one was the \"Dirty Blonde,\" which was more reminiscent of an orangier Blue Moon, while the \"Big Blue Van\" had a nice blueberry finish that I really liked...and you probably know by now that I am NOT a huge beer fan.   We used them to wash down Buttermilk Chicken and Bacon Jam Sliders, which were both awesome,  along with Garlic Parmesan Butter and Spicy Cajun dry rub boneless wings.   The big finale was the Brownie Sundae, natch. Not the usual twelve pounds of food we have,  but what can you do once you've filled up on great beer?  Besides,  we'll be back.

Also, they have cool stuffed animal decorations and have a cabin lodge feel.  Service: attractive girls wearing little clothes serving you food and drinks, anyone can enjoy that. Most of them are actually super friendly. They made sure to show my group of friends a good time, gave us our food quickly, and kept our beer belly replenished.  Food and drinks: The food is bar food... it is delicious but mostly fried. Lots of beer options and they have plenty of deals for cheap shots and mixed drinks.  Overall, always a good time here. The food and drinks are good, but the mood really gets people fun, relaxed and pumped for some sports action.",

    "text": "\"She's got legs and she knows how to use them.\"  The girls at Twin Peaks have legs for days and they show them off with their short shorts. Add to that the plaid shirts, sports on the big TVs, cold beer and the look of a mountain lodge and you have a little slice of masculine heaven. Aside from the pleasent scenery you have some good food too. I came this past Tuesday for my first visit. I had an email coupon for a $5 Philly Cheese Steak with the purchase of a drink. How can I say no to that?  For my drink I ordered a Twin Peaks special known as Knotty Brunette. It came out tall and icey. They serve their beer at 29 degrees. Crazy cold. Perfect for a hot Vegas afternoon. This brown ale has a rich flavor with a nice balance of hops and malt. It all pairs well with the strong beef flavor of the cheese steak sandwich.  The sandwich was a good size. There was a fair amount of beef, grilled onions and bell peppers amd MUSHROOMS. It is so hard to find mushrooms on a Philly. I was very happy to see those little fungi on there. Oh yeah, and a lot cheese too. The meat was a little bit charred which provided a nice textural element and that beautiful char flavor that I love so very much. The sandwich was a little dry but overall satisfying. The fries on the side weren't half bad either. I don't really care for shoestring fries but they were well cooked and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Where I got frustrated on this night was waiting for my check. My server, Nia, came by to clear my table and asked how I was doing. She asked this a couple of times as I sat there with nothing left on the table but some water. I finally told her I was ready to settle my bill. I suppose she was waiting for me to order another beer. No go. I was too full at that point.",

As far as food my review is a bit lacking due to the fact I don't really eat anything on the menu. I'm not a meat or dairy eater. Lucky for me they have a burger called the Imposter. It's a plant based burger made by Beyond Beef. As far as plant based burgers go it is delicious. It Is served with fries and your standard lettuce,tomato etc. toppings. I'm pleased to see that they include this option on the menu. If not for the Imposter burger I would still go for the beer and dog friendly patio.   The atmosphere is like your of grid in a log cabin in the woods or something. Tons of tvs and always playing all the big games and fights. The servers all wear short shorts and pretty tight revealing tops. So it's kind of more of a guys spot although not exclusively their has always been several women customers when I've been there.",

    "text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Most of the girls are not all that pretty ... and the food is overpriced (of course) and it is not that much better than the food at Hooters.   Ok, management, wake up and smell the coffee.   In the food&beverage industry, restaurants such as this are called \"breast-aurants.\" That's because the customers are NOT there for the overpriced, bland & mediocre food. They are there to look at, and chat up, attractive & personable waitresses in revealing attire. Management, that is the business you are in. Based on my observations, management has entirely forgotten that most central concept ... within this restaurant concept.  And management shouldn't revel over that large wolf-pack of men who come in just to suck down a couple of brewskis while consuming all the large screen TVs and bar stools during a major sporting event; they won't be around any other time, leaving the space vacant during most business hours and so they aren't going to make your monthly target numbers. To hit the numbers, you will require wait staff that will draw-in repeats & regulars who will log significant F&B spend on a routine, if not daily, basis in order to socialize with them. Again management, that IS the business you you have chosen to be in.   My two visits ended my season here, 0-2. My visits were on weekdays about 5pm. And yes this huge space was mostly vacant at that time. A time when regulars, if this place had any of any merit, would stop by after work to socialize with their favorite waitress. The food was of a somewhat higher quality than a typical Hooters - but that sure ain't sayin' much. My tab+tip each time was around $20, salad+burger+drink. F&B-wise, for a twenty, anyone could get much better food at a ton of other venues.   So we are back to the wait staff, required to take up the slack. A few of the waitresses were attractive, most were not. Worse, almost all of them had caught a serious case of \"diva flu,\" bothered by the mere thought of chatting up customers. Instead much more focused on strolling around as if on a pageant runway - and picking up tips off tables that were actually mostly attended by the food runners.  The capacity of this venue is gigantic and if management wants to fill it anywhere near the level required to pay the rent and keep the lights turned on, it is going to have to get serious about recruiting - and retaining - much more attractive and personable wait staff. And holding high expectations of them in terms of \"guest entertainment.\" Said another way, they will have to have some degree of personality beyond that of 'prima donna,' constantly mentally reveling in the notion they are so d@mn gorgeous that they are entitled to work here ... and entitled to easy money for no effort.  I suspect management here is on cruise-control, thinking they've purchased some-kinda turnkey operation/concept, doing little more than hiring the best of whomever happens to wander in to fill out an application and waiting for the venue to run itself based on its menu. That just won't cut it. Based on my knowledge from successful managers in this line of work (Hooters, Tilted Kilt), management should be ACTIVELY recruiting applicants to staff these positions. One manager I knew, whenever & where ever he encountered a personable, attractive young women at any kind of more tedious or lower paid work, he immediately shifted right into his \"recruiting-mode.\"  Again, this space is huge, and so it's a huge challenge for management to make sure it stays full. And the way to meet that challenge is for management to step up to the plate, do its job ... and get busy finding the type of waitress upon which this particular restaurant concept is so crucially reliant.",

Buffalo tenders , fried pickles and fried Mozzarella nuggets which were the star !! Crispy on outside and firm with just the right amount of gooey!! ( the whole plate could be a meal ) next came the hangover burger , a little on the small side for a \"mans restaurant \" but tasty  and cooked med well ( no temp was offered) the fries were covered in some kinda of salt but were cold ( no biggie cuz the appetizer had enough fried food to last me awhile ) my friend had the meatloaf which he said was very bland and he didn't finish ( which is an odd thing, lol) no dessert cuz I was full but all in all , if beautiful girls and average food is your thing , this might just be the place for you !!

(It also burned all the way through my digestive tract well into the next day - my colon felt lightly braised afterward).

Beer really is served at 29 degrees (they have a monitor over the bar dedicated to telling you the exact temperature of the kegs at any given moment.)

I forgot our waitress name but she was Asian, petite, super sweet and we had our kids were with us so we were quite demanding of her.  She was definitely on top of things and we left her. 22% tip becuz of that.  We loved all the TVs everywhere and will come back but will try a different food item.  The app platter was yummy but our burgers were so so.",

It was a bit loud as I could not hear what our hostess said but I just nodded, smiled and said thanks. Our server was nice but again I could hardly hear her so I just nodded, smiled, ordered a beer and my wife got a cocktail. My beer was ice cold and the cocktail was perfect. Lots of tvs and sports on made it feel like something was going on even though it's was still 100 degrees outside at 8pm. The food was good even though there was some really hot sauce that came on our pork nachos. Next time no hot sauce for sure. It's definitely way better than the last hooters I visited and the views are indeed very scenic!",

    "text": "Someone described TP to me as being like Hooters but better. I'm convinced he was not referencing the food. Because it is just awful.  I wouldn't be surprised if this place showed up on Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.   I never believed there was such a thing as a bad B.L.T. until now.  There is something not right about the sourdough bread this is served on. And the bacon isn't the best quality either. So order at your own risk. BTW...it is supposed to come with 5 strips of bacon. Mine came with 3.  The tomato soup however, is pretty good. But I wouldn't go out of my way for it.    My girlfriend had the smokehouse burger. She may as well have just ordered a bottle of cooking oil bc this thing was sloppy greasy and not very appealing. It is a rather large burger & it was crammed into a basket. Watching her try to manipulate it out was difficult & painful.   Atmosphere is \"ok.\"  We were seated at a high-top for 2 pushed up against a table for 6.  It was uncomfortable; felt like we were intruding on the group we were seated with.   There are tons of tv's around the bar & I noticed tv's at each booth. I actually think this is pretty cool...you can watch your game of choice without craning your neck to see what's on at the bar.   I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a sports bar or not. On the one hand, there are tv's a plenty tuned to various sport networks.  On the other, it is decorated as a log cabin with game heads galore, and moose printed fabrics on the chairs.  It's a large place but the way tables are arranged is odd: wide open like a warehouse on one side, cramped on another.   Everything on the menu is fried & there really isn't a theme. Bar food mixed with pot roast & meatloaf. I'm somewhat confused.   If you are wondering about bathrooms, you have 3 options: family, \"sit 2 p,\" and \"stand 2 p.\"    Overall, if you're looking for a spot to watch a game & grab a bevie this might be a great spot. If you're looking to actually grab a good meal...go elsewhere.   I am not sure what to say about the servers' \"costumes.\" Elly May Clampett meets Hooters is the best I can do.  3/8 update: Double check your receipt against your statement. What I signed for & what was charged are different amounts & not in my favor. DEFINITELY hate this place.",

Definitely unique to this location IME to have some beers priced out of happy hour but maybe it's a Vegas thing.   Substituted asparagus for fries cuz I'm trying to be healthy, while enjoying the bacon burger without the bun, of course.   Brandon made sure that everything was good and thanked me for checking out this location which i thought was very courteous of him.   Fair number of people enjoying their evening but plenty of space to be had around 1030 on a Monday night.   I like the mix of food I can eat while maintaining Keto, affordable beer, sports & highlights, and world class scenery.",

    "text": "I go to Twin Peaks in Henderson every Friday around 415 to meet friends which we have been going there for the past three years. It's the same problem this week as last week and the week before.Service and quality of food were always excellent and that's why we visited this place every week. After sitting down at a table, a waitress took our order. She said the shift was about to change at 4:30 but she would get our drink orders anyway. We never got our drink orders. At 4:30, a new waitress came up and asked if we had ordered and we said yes. Then our old waitress came up to the new waitress and said she never put our order in. ??? I guess she would not be around to collect the tip since she was leaving. The new waitress took our order again. We now waited another 22 minutes and still no beer. Our waitress apologized 3 times and then asked if she could bring us water since it is taking so long. We said yes. She charged us for the waters that we thought were complimentary because of the long wait . When the food came out, one of the orders was wrong . We were there for almost 2 hours and never saw a manager on the floor ??? . I am not writing this to get a free meal because I managed restaurants most my life. I'm writing this to bring it to attention so you can correct the problem. Again for 2 1/2 years,the food was always excellent and the service was always excellent and the female manager would come and ask us how our food and service were every time. I don't know what happened to her. Football is just starting up and you know how important service is for a high volume . You will be losing a lot of sales,I'm sure you know, with slow service. Good luck",

I'm sure she was just excited to finally have another woman to talk to. The majority of their clientele is obviously of the male variety. While we were there we were probably the only women eating there.  The food was decent.  It's kind of funny because a lot of their food reminded me of food from other restaurants.  Their fried pickles were good and reminded me of Hooters.  Their fries were good and reminded me exactly of Red Robin.  Everything else was pretty non memorable. I had a grilled chicken sandwich and the bun was mushy and soggy.  I'm going to stick with Hooters.  Nothing personal.",

She then went directly to the computer to put in the order and instantly had to ask me again what my roommate ordered. When our food did come out they initially gave it to the wrong people at the bar. The couple said it wasn't their food and then the bartender didn't know where the food was supposed to go. I saw her looking confused holding our food so I told her it was ours.   This location just opened not long ago so I know they are still working out all the kinks so I'm not to hold it against them. I really hope that's the case and they didn't just hire airheads. Haha. I would come back to eat there or have a drink again.

    "text": "Inspired no doubt by Hooters this place could use a little more attention to the food.  The beer is cold and the place is clean and full of TV's but seriously lacks in the smaller details.  The chair that I was in had crumbs on it, like the server or busser wiped the table on the chairs.  The food however was a little disappointing. On the pork sliders the slaw was limp and flavorless while the bun was almost inedibley hard. Was going to get the Shot Ski but was told we couldn't get one of each kind, we had to pick one.  So because we wanted to try 4 or the 5 varieties we would have to pay full price so we just passed on the ski.  Last, but seems to be a problem at a lot of Valley eateries, LEARN TO COOK A BURGER, ordered medium and it came out rare, then it came back medium well close to well and very dry, like they pushed all the juice out of it.  The place is nice and big and the prices aren't to bad.",

I have never been to a sports bar that had wall-to-wall giant screen televisions for viewing. You could literally watch any sport or game with how many they have! And I liked the fact that they weren't on full blast for volume so we could still enjoy our conversation.  Our food was extremely tasty and the portions were large. I had the Sampler with Fried Chicken, Jumbo Shrimp, and Fried Fish with a nicely salted bed of fries. So good! My wife had the Bacon Jam Sliders which needs to be on every menu in town. Those were very filling for just being sliders! Our good friend had the Chicken Fried Chicken which is a humongous chicken breast made like your regular chicken fried steak. Breading was nicely crispy and it was smothered in this Jalapeno gravy that I should've ordered a side of so I could dip my fries into it. I better stop because I'm getting hungry again!",

I just would have been more comfortable if it was not but like I said, we didnt know what we were getting into till we got there.      The waitresses all wore very skimpy outfits.   Underwear and a bikini top basically.   I suppose for men who are there to watch sports, drink beer and stare at pretty girls its a great place.     Was a tad bit uncomfortable but that says nothing about the restaurant.   The food and servce was excellent!  Sienna was our server and she was very friendly and I asked her for a bloody mary without vodka as I cannot drink and she was like-sure, no problem.   I ordered fish and chips which were perfect and my ex got the grilled turkey sandwich which he really liked.  The Die made him try chicken fingers which were great and I had to try The Blonde Bean and Bacon soup which was very good!  The tv at the tables is an extra bonus again for those that like sports  :)      Not sure we would return though as comfort has to be a high priority and neither of us felt that comfortable there.     :/",

This leaves my family with a limited amount of places where we can go to enjoy a few beers and watch a few games.    For Happy Hour this place is awesome!  Cheap MAN SIZE (22 oz) beers for $3-5, I can't find many places cheaper than that.  Plus many appetizers for half off, what a bonus!  Their atmosphere is great.  It is like being at a lodge in the mountains.  In addition, the animals gives my son something to look at.  Also, just walking into the place and seeing 10 big TVs before you even get into the building is awesome!  My wife also loves this place.  One great thing about it is that it's family friendly.  They even have a family restroom that I can use to change my son's diaper in peace.   So many other restaurants don't even have changing stations in the guys restrooms.  The service has always been great.  The waitresses are always extremely friendly and helpful. No complaints there.  The only thing I can think of that would improve the place would be the food.  I would like to see a few more options on the menu.  That's just me though, as I get bored and like to try many different things.  Almost forgot,  the fries are damn good!!  Make sure to try them.  The fried pickles are awesome as well.  I've already converted a few people to the place that previously favored Buffalo Wild Wings.",

This location does not have that unfortunately). This restaurant is located in a developed shopping plaza that's always pretty busy. The plaza is populated with a DIVERSE array of restaurants and other services which is generally great for everyone. This restaurant is a stand alone building and one of the biggest independent buildings in the plaza (right off Eastern Ave., you can't miss it driving on the street). With that said, the restaurant is pretty big inside with a ton of tables and an outdoor patio with additional seating. My favorite part of this restaurant is the big bar located in the middle of the restaurant. It's very inviting and great for watching sports on one of their many high-definition TVs above the bar. It's one of the larger bars (seating wise) that I've sat at in the city. The staff is also great at serving drinks and conversing over the bar. Beer is really the drink of choice at Twin Peaks (I love their in-house Dirty Blonde). I love that they're served in tall ICEY COLD mugs. The beer on tap is also super frothy and icy which makes it all perfect for hot summer nights in Vegas! They also have a fully stocked back bar and food menu (which is pretty standard).",

Good bear and drink options. Classic rock tunes playing overhead. The food is typical fare:  lots of wings choices, a number of decent sandwiches, a few soups, and a couple of salad choices. There were five of us, and nobody was overly impressed by their food. Worse of all, the service was very slow, and not all of us were served at the same time (awkward).  The place was 1/2 full, and their were an adequate  number of bouncing titties, so service could/should have been better. Prices were fair, and the calories of most items were listed. In all, only a fair restaurant choice.",

However after the server found out that I was a new customer and lived in Las Vegas for 16 yrs.  It took her 30 mins to come check on me, now i understand catering on your regulars. But the idea is to create new regulars and make them feel welcome.  Well that didn't happen I felt like I was a borther sitting by my self. I did not feel like i was well at all.  I eat out on an average 4 to 5 nights a week bill ranging from $30 to $150, plus I normally tip 50% to 70% of the bill.  Unfortunately I will not be returning its a shame the food is very good.",

I came to this location and we waited 15 mins before our waitress even came to ask what drinks we wanted.  I was disappointed already. After we ordered our food, we waited 45 mins before the food even came. I won't lie though.... the Parmesan Wings were off the hook! I got some Ghost Pepper Wings as well and man.... it was TOO hot for me! I had 1 bite and I couldn't take it. If you love spicy food, you'll love this one, I'm weak lol  It still doesn't make up for the bad service. I see the good reviews on here so maybe tonight was an off night for my visit. I'll probably come back cuz I like their wings. Hopefully the service will be better. Giving 2 stars for the Wings!",

I guess they think Colorado (where it's brewed) is a foreign country.   DARK beers are served ice cold and Blue Moon are is considered and import?  It's really apparent that the executives of the company have no clue about beer.    If you're a True beer officanado, this really isn't the place for you!",

I had to call my bank to dispute the transactions.

    "text": "I DONT EVEN WANT TO GIVE THEM 1 star   So now I have went back to this establishment last night (only because I love the food) and I experienced a waiter named Chelsea . Now everything was going good with my food and my order up until the last minute when it was time to pay. I attended this establishment having a business meeting with two other guests , and when it came for the bill( which she nicely split) two of us paid cash, and one paid card . Chelsea took our bills and NEVER brought back our change, asked if we wanted our change, brought a copy of our receipt .. nothing ... I sat and waited an extra 10 min and watched her take other people's bills just to see if I was wrong and she was coming back .. well she never came back.. instead she sat at the table next to us and conversed with however rather then service us right. So I decided to get up and leave in which I stated to Chelsea (while she was sitting st the table next to us with people) that she never brought me back our change and her response was \"ohhh do you want your 40 cents\"... now .. I wouldn't have cared but it's the principle of customer service and being a waiter . You just keep people's change without asking if they want it back? That's technically stealing . I guess this is the world we live in  , where waitresses assume you're going to tip them. I honestly have had it with this establishment and the rudeness of their people. Don't work in customer service or the service industry. I aren't going to treat people like they stepped into your home .  Update : I called scot THE DISTRICT MANAGER &' NO CALL WAS RETURNED IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM.  This establishment is PATHETIC ON CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION TO ANYBODY EVER. GO TO THE ONE ON THE STRIP ... this one will continuously disappoint you",

Well, I witnessed one of these stars in Person at Twin Peaks, and it gave a whole new meaning to the term.   Stephanie is the epitome of what a venue like this offers. She is stunning, that is for sure, but its so much more than that. Her service is exemplary. She has amazing product knowledge, and is a True professional at her craft. She actually takes the time to remember some guests names, and their preferences. Who does that in a high volume place like this? Stephanie does. I am in the industry and I truly appreciate fantastic service, and that is exactly what Stephanie offers. It was Maya Angelou that said.... \"At the end of the day people won't remember what you said or did, they will remember how you made them feel.\". Well, Stephanie makes her guests feel welcome and special.   I would also like to mention that the food here is actually good. Its actually amazing how much Twin Peaks \"Out-Hooters\" Hooters. Its like they took Hooters business model and multiplied it by 10.  Well, with superstars like Stephanie, its easy to understand their success. Ask for her by name. Thank me later. (Ok, I stole that last line from Drake)",

Our server Jacqueline apologized profusely for the delay in service due to being shortstaffed. The prices were very reasonable. You can get a burger and fries for under ten bucks! The bud light came in a tall frosty mug and was awesome! The quesadilla was surprisingly tasty. Kinda disappointing that the grilled chicken and shrimp only included 5 shrimp. My wife loved her buffalo tacos. Our total bill including tip came up to  $76, which isn't bad for Vegas. Would definitely try again!",

    "text": "Was here Saturday for the UFC fights, it was packed and the service was amazing.  Madison was our server and she was awesome...our drinks were never empty and she was by several times to check on us.  Tonight, Wednesday it was not crowded, we had Jackie as our server and I believe she did a good job but the kitchen and the manager dropped the ball.  We ordered food, I ordered something off the happy hour and then a burger.  My two friends ordered food as well.  Everything came out except my burger.  I asked her about the burger twice and was told it would be right out.  20 minutes passed and I finally told her to cancel my burger and take it off the bill.  She said she would and then she showed up at the table with the burger asking if I still wanted it saying the manager told her to ask.  I said no please take it off the bill.  Then the manager came out apologized and asked if I wanted something else on the house.  Being that we were done I said no thank you.  Then the bill came and guess what, the burger was still on the bill.  I told Jackie and she took the bill, then came back and asked if we wanted separate bills or just one.  We said one was fine.  10 minutes to get the bill and it still was wrong, that is just unacceptable.  At this point I don't know if it's Jackie or the management but they just don't have it together tonight.  Even my friend who comes her 3 or 4 times a week said it was the worst service he has ever seen here.  If I could give a zero I would.",

    "text": "I would say more like 3.5 stars, so I'll be nice and round up.  I was excited to see that Twin Peaks opened in the area and was disappointed to hear about and see a lot of bad reviews.  I needed a quick bite to eat before my bowling league on Sunday and would normally go to BJ's next door.  I decided to try something different and stopped in Twin Peaks.  Upon entering, I was immediately hit with the smell of fresh wood.  The entire place looks like a lodge in the mountains somewhere.  There were at least 7 hostesses/servers gathered at the host stand, chatting.  They immediately greeted me and offered a seat.  I just decided to sit at the bar, as I usually do when I am by myself.  This is a pretty large place with TONS of seating.  There are booths, tables and high tops, as well as a patio with tables.  There are also a lot of TV's.  Depending on what specials they offer (if any), this could be a great place to watch football.  It didn't take very long for the bartender (Rachael) to approach me.  I decided to try one of their signature beers - the Knotty (Naughty) Brunette.  They also offer a Dirty Blonde.  It was served in a large glass mug and was SUPER cold.  Cold beer is good beer.  It was reasonably priced at $7.  I also noticed that they had Sculpin and another BP beer on tap, which is awesome.  That alone is worth another visit (I didn't see if the Sculpin is also $7 - if so, I might become a regular. LOL).  The bartender asked if I wanted to start a tab or pay cash as I go.  I understand why they do this, but I had already told her that I was also ordering food, so it was silly for me to pay for my beer and then my food seperately.  The strange thing is, once I ordered food, she just placed the receipt in the glass in front of me and never asked for payment. Fine by me, but why bring it up if you're not going to follow through?  Anyhow, I ordered the steak salad ($12.95).  It was pretty good.  The steak was slightly over done - I ordered it medium rare and there wasn't much pink, if any at all.  Not horrible though.  The salad itself was good.  It was romaine lettuce with pico de gallo, pepper jack, roasted corn, tortilla strips and black beans with a cilantro lime vinaigrette.  The dressing was light and really good.  I am not sure I'd order this again, but it was good for a late lunch.  Overall, this place was solid.  The service was fast and friendly at the bar and the beer was very cold.  I would definitely like to go back and sit at a table to see what all the complaints are about.  But I will say this:  it's obvious that (most of) these girls were not hired based off skill.  Give them a break!  I think people are being far too hard on them.  1st of all, it's a newly opened restaurant and there will be kinks to work out.  2nd of all - I bet the guys aren't complaining!",

There is huge bar in the center with lots of tv's lining the top.  They also have a huge patio area with many tables for the al fresco diner.    We were seated right away with time to look over our menus.   A lot of time.  By the time our waitress came over to get our drink orders and they were actually brought out, I was starving.  We decided to split the queso dip with chili.  This was delicious!  If it wasn't frowned upon, I would have licked the bowl.  A different server even brought us extra chips!  Nice touch!   For the entree we split the Chicken Philly Texas Style.  Texas style means they add jalapenos and queso.  Can't go wrong with that!  We waited quite a while for our sandwich to arrive but I was pleased with the flavor when I bit into it.  There was a great amount of chicken, peppers, jalapenos and cheese to fill my half of the sandwich.  The fries were ok but nothing to write home about.  I would suggest saving the queso dip to have something to dip the fries in.    I think we saw our original waitress twice during our visit...  once for our drinks and once for the bill.   The restaurant manager even refilled our drinks once.  For not being overly busy, there wasn't any excuse for poor service.",

All the servers are pretty cute, fit, and young.   My bf ordered the chicken strips.  She asked what sauce, so our friend said honey mustard, my bf and I said ranch at the same time.  I pulled her aside and said we could just share one ranch.  I also ordered ONE pretzel.  Our order was brought back and we got 2 pretzels and also 2 ranch(there is a charge per ranch).  I asked about the pretzel, they were willing to take it back. However, the boys agreed to eat it.  The food wasn't bad, typical bar food.  Actually better food than the restaurant most adjacent.  Our friend joined the table much later. Very quickly our server came to ask what he would like to drink. Good job!  My bf ordered another small beer but then she brought back the large one.  We never had to wait on our service, but she did not always get it right.   They offer a fun 4 person shot on a ski. Chanting, \"shotski! Shotski! Shotski!\"  At some point some hip hop music was blasting loud on the speakers during the shot ski. (The speakers were LOUD)   This spot is like a hooters but with mid drifts.   I think this location is more attractive than the one on the strip.  Will for sure be a hang out for us close to home.  I'd say generously 3 stars for food.  And an extra one for the experience the boys enjoyed the atmosphere.  Wish the girls stopped by our table more, I feel like since I'm a girl maybe they didn't want to?",

She deliver only one chip we ask and said we order 2 she bring the second chips without the deep. We ask her again you don't give as deep she don't even say anything and left and bring the deep back. We wait for 30 minutes for our boneless chicken and we ask her where is our order she said you don't order chicken. WTF is she on drugs? I think so because she really don't give attention to our tables. I'm very upset and ask my family leave and go to another restaurant. Never come back again with this experienced. Worse service ever.",

The servers have on sexy lumberjack looking outfits with their twin peaks, hence the name of the joint. It's pretty much standard bar food like wings and burgers. Their fried pickles were freaking delicious.   We came here with about 15 people. Our server was super sweet and easy going. She kept the drinks flowing and made sure we were taken care of. They do this little dance number and since I was pretty drunk, I decided to join them:) The bartender chick was another story, hence the one star taken off. We went up to the bar to get our drinks since our server was really busy with other tables. We order a shot of Tito's, a Divorce (one of their signature shots) and a vodka ginger ale. I was pretty drunk already but still managed to remember our drinks. The bartender asked me 3 times what it was that I ordered. And she was the sober one. Not so smart there, and it took her forever to make the Divorce because she had no idea what it was made with.   Anyway, I still had a good time. Fun place to hang out with your friends and have a few drinks.",

The manager told her that because they just got a large group in the dining room that they could no longer seat anyone else. Not \"Can you have a drink at the bar and give us 10-15 minutes\", just not seating anyone with no idea when they might seat people. I have NEVER in all my days seen this. We took an Uber to get her so we could get our drink on!  WTH?!?  I will NEVER go back there. The food isn't even that great and the scenic views included a flabby butt cheek hanging out of the shorts of the hostess. So. Dumb.",

If the health department would have come in they would have been marked for multiple infractions. I wanted another drink but the chance of dust on my drink made me leave.  This is completely unacceptable and I might just call the health department myself and tell them to come by tomorrow night at 10:30 so they can see what I saw.  Never coming back again!",

Tons of TVs to catch your favorite games on.   Nice weekday happy hours (early and late).  Overall, great place to drop in and get a nosh while watching your favorite team.",

    "text": "This place is just absolutely horrible. Went in to check it out and have some dinner. 45 minute wait not a big deal, decided to go to the bar and get some drinks. I was looked at and past over by 3 different bartenders (presumably because I am a female). Word of advise ladies- we will tip you well also as long as you give good service. Two gentlemen at the bar had to ask the bartender for the drinks I wanted because I was being ignored.   Buzzer for table goes off right as I got the drinks.  Get shown to the table (good thing I got two drinks at the bar), it took 10 to 15 minutes for the server to show up.  And talk about stupid.  I understand the concept of the restaurant but seriously train your staff better.   We were going to order a bunch of starters (what they call teasers). There menu is not that big.  Ordered soft pretzels,  they wes out.  Ordered pulled pork sliders,  server said I think we might be out,  can you go check so we can make a decision.  Yep, they were out. Asked the server,  what do you have?  She says everything else. Ok.  What kind of fish is used for the fish tacos,  oh we are out of fish, but if we had it tilapia.  (How do you run out of half the items in your menu? ) Do you have any wine?  Yes,  chardonnay and white zinfandel.  Do you have any red wine?  Yes, it's a cabernet, I think.   Food was so so.   Time to pay the bill, have her $32 in cash asked for the rest to be put on a debit card.  Only puts in$22 in cash and the rest on a credit card.  Called her over,  told her the mistake and she gets mad at us.  Sorry darlin' you were not worth the $10 you tried to pocket.    Again ladies,  just because we are not interested in your Twin Peaks doesn't mean that you have to ignore us and give us crappy,  no horrific service.  If you givegood serviceyou willbe tipped well.  Gengerally 20-30%.  We are all in the industry and if you worked for me you wouldn't have a job.",

The last three times we have eaten here the orders have been a comedy of errors. Example : the last visit:  one order was for fish tacos, we got steak tacos, also ordered the sourdough BLT dry with no mayo and ask for mustard or requested it on the side, either way....never got it.... one other issue: ordered the combo appetizer platter... we received it after we were 2/3 of the way finished with our entree. They are always very apologetic (they seem to have too much practice in this area) and seem to try hard but this is the third time in a row they have messed the order up ....... seems to be a pattern. I'm sure they will correct it but it becomes a bit of an irritation .",

Had chips and queso which was ok nothing special. Later ordered a the ranch chicken sandwich that was probably a 3/5 stars. Apparently the host station is in charge of the music so when there is a commercial on they turn on the music. Well let me just say that is a bad set up and you need to pay attention to the game or it's a total fail. The beers were extremely cold with a range of 26-30 degrees that made the beer (imo) taste so much better. Now Savanna from Hawaii was our server and for me she gets 5/5 stars. She was very attentive and super friendly. Savanna was the Best! Good place to watch football, clean and it's not smokey. The place got super crowded so go early if you want a table.",
