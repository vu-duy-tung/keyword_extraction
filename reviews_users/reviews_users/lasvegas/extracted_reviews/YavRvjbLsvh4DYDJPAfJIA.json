    "text": "Wanna talk about asian soul food? Try the beef stew at Pho Saigon 8. OMG its soo thick, rich, and hearty. It comes served with either french bread, rice, and noodles but my bf and i will always order all three LOL. its way too good to even waste a single drop.   Okay enough with the obsessiveness. I have been to many pho shops in las vegas, little saigon, pho kim long, pho so 1 and it seems like the beef stew always comes out as beef soup. Its flavorless, oily, and watery. At pho saigon 8, you can tell the broth gets its richness from the cubes of beef and tendon and the sweetness from the onions and the carrots boiling for many hours. Since this location has opened, either one of us always orders this dish. But as usual the pho-, bun-, and the plate dishes are exceptional. The only reason why I give this place 4 and not 5 stars is because of the customer service, the waitress sat us at a dirty and sticky table and the server next came to refill our water. If you look at a typical asian family,  it seems like we care mainly about the taste/ quality of food only and less the customer service aspect. We have this 'dont bother me, dont check on me unless if i ask' kinda thing. But wiping down tables, and refilling water should be a must!",

    "text": "When I lived in Vegas, this was my go-to place for a good bowl of pho. I lived alone at the time, so I rarely ever cooked pho at home since a pot of it can feed a dozen people. Vietnamese food has come a long way since I moved there in 2006. Pho Saigon 8 is one of the best in town. The broth is clear and flavorful, made with just the right amount of each ingredient. Some places botch the soup by adding too much of a certain ingredient. Clarity is a good indication of the quality of a pho broth. If it's cloudy, it's probably no bueno.   Besides the pho, the other dish I usually order here is the Hu Tieu My Tho with the soup on the side. I love Hu Tieu, probably even more than Pho, and this place has the best in town. Nothing compared to my hometown favorites (Nam Vang & Da Lat), but it's the best thing I can eat when I am not at home. For those who don't know, Hu Tieu is another variation of Pho. It comes with noodles and meat. I prefer to keep the broth separated and eat the noodles dry. I sip the broth with each bite and it's quite a delicious way to eat noodles.",

    "text": "We've been looking for a yummy Pho for a while and Yelp helped us find Pho Saigon 8!!    I ordered a Tofu vegetable Pho while the boyfriend ordered Chicken Pho and Spring Rolls. (bill came out to $20 and change)  DE-LICIOUS!  Eric said his chicken was moist (not the usual overcooked and dry) broth was a perfect, steaming hot- but NOT burn your mouth hot.    ...Talk about FAST food, the spring rolls came out minutes after we ordered it and our Pho came out as Eric was finishing up his appetizer (and he eats fast!)  it's a smaller restaurant and was packed at 5pm (it's a good sign that the food was going to be good!).  The decor is nice, table tops are some kind of stone/granite (no booths) and it was clean.  I'm agreeing with another reviewer, it's a tight fit and the tables are a little close together and I don't recall any type of music playing.  The service was friendly, nice and quick- although there was not much rapport between us.  They were great about busing the tables and keeping it clutter-free (my pet peeve).  Must agree with another reviewer, the parking lot is a little small...   Despite the semi-negative description of the restaurant itself, don't let that stop you from eating the YUMMY food!!  I overheard customer at another table complementing the server for the GREAT food he just had.  He introduced himself to the server and told him he would be a frequent customer.. :o) = so I know I wasn't the only one Raving about how good the food was!!!  5 stars for delicious food at a great price, nice sized servings (was a bonus) and quick and friendly service.  This will be a restaurant that we re-visit a few times a month- I know it!",

This place is closer to me than Chinatown, so that's a plus for me.  My favorite dish is #71, the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio, a.k.a. grilled sliced pork and fried egg rolls over vermicelli noodles and vegetables.  The pork has great flavor, almost a sweet taste to it, and I love the combination of pieces of pork and eggroll, noodle, and peanuts in one chopstick-ful (as opposed to spoonful).  Delicious and cheap!    It can get pretty busy during both lunch and dinner, so the service leaves much to be desired during those times.  Also, the parking lot is shared with various other popular establishments, so it can be hard to find a close parking spot during peak times.   My experience with takeout orders has been positive as well.  The orders are packed well and the time estimates are pretty accurate.",

    "text": "so I got this place mixed up with Pho Little Saigon. I did originally rant a rave about how great this place was but it was not the right place. my bad, sorry for the confusion. However, I did have the pleasure of stopping into this establishment after my work out at the las vegas athletic club (same parking lot). I ordered the seafood pho and this place does it a bit different with the items of meat in the pho. They give you tiny eggs so i'm wondering if its maybe quail eggs? I don't know if they do this in all their pho dishes or if it is just in the seafood one, but one of the eggs seems to be a bit off so I don't know if it was bad or what. The broth is strangely sour if you taste it on its own.  its a clear yellow color which is not beef broth like its supposed to be. After adding all veggies, noodles, and meat it does take some of the sourness away but the broth is not authentic. Its lacking in the proper pho spices/flavor. it really was just a sour/salty broth. definitely not a traditional authentic Pho broth at all. in my opinion you are much better off going to the Pho Little Saigon in the chuck e cheese/99 cent store/in and out parking lot on the other side of the 2-15 to get the real deal, you will be much happier. Its where I always go when I am to lazy to make my own traditional Vietnamese food at home. Don't even waste your time at Pho Mai lan, its a rip off very expensive for what you get and its not authentic either, their beef broth is literally beef broth with no Pho spice flavor. $10 for a bowl of Pho is just ridiculous especially if its not the real deal!!!",

I'm Thai, we Thais need something other than siracha. I only wish they had fresh ground chili.   4. Service is simple, they just take order and you get up and pay at counter, I like that.

Service: no complains at all... Unfortunately I didn't get his name, only saw he was wearing a white Nike hat. I changed my order after I've ordered already cause I couldn't make up my mind, he did not give me any ugly looks, my ice water was never empty, always has a smile on his face and that's major plus to the restaurant... I was a server as well so I pay extra attention to servers performance and he did great.  Now food, here's the down side... I ordered a large Bun Bo Hue and instead of regular noodles I requested for pho noodles (personal liking, chewier). It could've definitely use a lil more flavor for sure, I ordered pho so it would be more chewy... But mines came out really soft, kinda disappointment... It was filling... But I did order a large.   Service was great Food wise wasn't bad, but definitely had better That's what took the star away for me Will go back for sure, to see if it'll be better to get that five star",

    "text": "I was never a fan of Vietnamese food.  The first time I ever ate it was over ten years ago and thought to myself how I'd never eat it again.  I met my ex from Seattle and moved there for about almost 4 years and everywhere I went was a Pho restaurant.  After a while I came to fall in love with their food and only in Seattle.  I swore that there would never be another Vietnamese restaurant that can compare.  Today, mom decided she wanted to eat Vietnamese and thought what the heck.  I drove on Eastern, passed the I-215, and right by the Las Vegas Athletic Club was the restaurant.    When I walked in, mom had already been seated and luckily there was no line.  Last time we were here there was a twenty minute wait.  It's a somewhat small intimate restaurant with so many tables and chairs so close to one another.  So many people talking loudly, and plates clattering, sipping their soup loudly made me wonder if this is actually what it's like in a restaurant in Vietnam.  Looking forward to the day I find out through hands on experience.  No time was wasted and I gave my order of a #70.  I forgot the name but there was white noodles, some vegetables, herbs, barbecue shrimp, barbecue thinly sliced pork, and spring rolls.  The sauce on the side tasted like a sweet fish sauce with carrots and other ingredients to hide the gross smell of fish sauce.  I poured that in my bowl and mixed all the food around.  I haven't talked about fireworks in my mouth because it's been a while since I've felt that.  But, we're gonna talk about that in this review.  FIREWORKS!!!  When I put the food in my mouth, I literally felt like I was in the sky with fireworks around me.  I can still remember it like it was just a minute ago.  Normally, I don't like to eat past being full, but this dish was just too good to not finish.  The combination of the pork, noodles, vegetables, and sauce blended well together.  Food Network judges talks about texture a lot and this dish is not just mushy noodles and meat, but had the crunch of the vegetables and spring rolls.  The different texture was definitely there and worked very well with this dish.  Mom ordered something with seafood pho.  It was also very well made with crunchy garlic sprinkled on top.  Mom added vegetables and herbs to it which gave it a playful texture.  Her pho was also great.  All the food was awesome which is why I gave it a 4 stars.    It's just too bad that the servers were far too busy to give any smile to the customers.  They're all so serious and don't look very friendly.  I'm sure they're very nice outside of work but while serving my mother and I, we didn't get that welcome feeling like they wanted us there.  Sure, they gave us water, took our order, brought out our food and finally our check.  That's all routine.  There was no *umph* to their service.  It was just eh and blah.  3 stars to the servers and 4 stars to the cooks.  I'm sure they were in a good mood to be cooking AWWWWWESOOMMMMMME!",

Perhaps I never had an issue with the service here, or perhaps I know not to really expect much in terms of service in small culturally unique joints such as this one. I also think the language barrier plays a role in the type of service you receive.   The service was ok, no one was rude nor made us feel rushed while we, two of the most indecisive people in the world, reviewed the menu. The Pho was good enough to warrant a return visit when I am not feeling like driving too far from my house for a bowl of pho. They provide all of the necessary standards such as the condiments (I love me some siracha!) and a heaping plate full of additions such as fresh herbs, sprouts and lime to add as needed.  I think Pho Little Saigon across the street and this joint are almost identical in service and in quality. My review is more of a 3.5 star but I will round it up as I am feeling generous.",

    "text": "Best Pho I've found in Vegas.  The place is fairly nice for a Henderson strip mall. Decor is appropriate and tasteful, you'd have friends and family here; unlike most Pho joints that feel like a Vietnamese Robertos. Not that there's anything wrong with Robertos, it's just not a place you'd take a hot date. Saigon 8 is. Actually,  a \"best I can get right now\" date or \"I'm feeling fat/unemployed\" kinda date, but regardless, you won't be ashamed of this place.  The Pho is excellent. Standard pho gringo rules apply with Pho, stick with the Pho tai until you know what you're dealing with. Tripe is not for the unfamiliar stomach.  One amazing thing they do here that's apparently illegal in Vietnam: the veggie pho actually features veggie broth, and IT'S MARKED ON THE CONTAINER.  Also a fun game we play every time I call: I say: \"Hi can I have a Pho Tai and a Veggie Pho please? Extra meat and extra Jalapenos\" They say: \"(Vocal Noises sounding mildly like english that may or may not be confirming my order.)\" \"I didn't catch that, was that a Pho Tai and a Veggie Pho\" \"(Garbles that may be English with incomprehensible accent)... 10 minutes\". \"Okay thanks\"  And my order has always been right over 10+ visits. Always extra Jalapenos, always extra meat, never any missing sides. This impresses me more than anything else.",

He looks at me with a blank look and leaves to go talk and reminisce with another table while I just sat there.  He looked confused when I got up after a few  minutes (never to return). I had decided there are too many Asian restaurants that would appreciate my simple order.  I drove to one of the nearby Asian restaurants a mile down the road that made me feel welcomed with delicious food.

A solid 4/5.  We also ordered a small bo of bun bo hue - a spicy beef noodle soup which came with a thicker noodle. Wasn't a huge fan of the broth, almost felt a bit watered down spice wise compared to what I've had at other places. For the small bowl for $9.45, I'll probably skip this for next time.   Other than that, service was good and they gave generous portion of bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos and limes for the pho.",

I always get pho, spring rolls, or some type of vermicelli bowl. My usual options never disappoint so I keep sticking to them. If I'm getting pho, I always get #16 which has rare round eye, flank, and brisket. It is so yummy and satisfying!  I love the deep fried spring rolls. They might be called egg rolls, but I'm not actually sure. It comes with lettuce, mint, and pickled carrots and radish. I usually wrap one with lettuce and make a little burrito with the extra stuff and pour some of the sauce on top. You have got to try it! Sometimes that's all I'll order and I won't even share it.  It's a good restaurant, it's clean, and it's pretty cheap, especially for knowing your food will turn out right. Not everyone on the waiting staff speaks English very well. That never bothers me but I'm mentioning it in case some people need to prepare themselves for that. Be patient and understanding, and you shall have a delicious meal!",

The overall experience was absolutely amazing. I would highly recommend checking this place out.",

I was able to stop in here for a fresh, tasty bowl of beef pho with tender rare steak and a Vietnamese ice coffee on my way to the airport.    As opposed to the bay area, this place is much nicer than the average pho joint where I'm from.  The furniture here is a rich chocolate brown color including the walls where matchstick bamboo roll up shades hang over the windows.  The table tops on dark wooden legs are a sturdy granite with green and brown shades.  Even the chairs are  unique with routered silhouettes of bowls of pho with chopsticks on the wooden seat back of each chair.  There is a nice selection of dark green foliage inside giving the restaurant somewhat of an exotic feel.  The service here is also attentive, friendly and good.  They will clear your table as dishes become empty unlike the average pho spot which waits until you're completely finished.",

I would always go here especially since it was right next to LVAC and I would usually come here for a quick bite to eat after the gym or craving for some vietnamese food.    The food was just okay nothing amazing.   Spring Rolls: It is usually a hit & miss thing. Sometimes its tasteful and sometimes is very bland.  When its bland I would have to use a lot of the dipping sauce to have some taste to the spring rolls.  Pho: I normally dont order pho, but when I finally did, I hated it.  I forgot what I ordered but it was not great at all.  It was cold and I asked them to reheat it, but one of the servers didnt understand what I was asking.  They had to ask another server to figure out what I wanted.  But after they reheated it, it wasnt something I would order again.   Pork&Rice: I usually order this and in order for me to enjoy it. I would always use the pho's broth that they bring on the side and I would add it to the meat and rice to have more flavor to it.    Service:  They normally dont smile when you enter their restaurant and only one or two of them is friendly.  I would have to flag them down to re-fill my glass of water and ask for the check.",

Cramped seating. Waiter speaks Viet to take our order. Grandma serves us our meal. Pay at the cashier after you finish eating. The only thing missing is a sign that says cash only! haha! Love it!  - Pho tai chin: noodle soup with rare eye round steak and well done lean meat Steaming hot when served. Broth was good, but average. I liked how the well done meat didn't have a lot of fat on it. Need more bean sprouts and cilantro.  - Com ga roti: roasted Cornish hen, served with French rice or steamed rice, 8.05 Delicious French rice. They made it crispy and dry enough where you can still taste the tomato paste and not soggy. The chicken was a bit burnt and quite small. They did give plenty of vegetable sides and broth side soup was a good compliment. Seems like the side soup is what they would use for their wanton soup.  - Viets eat here so you know its good. - It takes hours to make the broth of pho bc you have to cook the bone. Just because its fast, doesn't mean its old. It's marinated.  - Prices are cheaper than others in Henderson. I think this place gets mixed reviews since it's Henderson and expect American style service.  - Similar to Spring Mountain",

    "text": "This is my go-to pho restaurant here in Henderson (for the record, I have not yet tried Pho Mai Lan down the street). As a Vietnamese girl who grew up in Orange County (the largest congregation of Vietnamese people outside of Vietnam), I can only give it 3 stars.   The food is \"good enough\" to satisfy my cravings, but nowhere near the best or even mediocre Vietnamese food in SoCal. They have a really great variety so I can get pretty much anything I'm craving, and their Vietnamese iced coffee is really good (and properly served with a drip thing over a mug with condensed milk and a cup of ice).   Yeah, the staff isn't super friendly, but that's how Vietnamese restaurants are, in my experience. They hussle you in and out and don't really come back to check on you - pretty standard. However, the one thing that's incredibly annoying is that they insist you order by the menu item # and when the food comes out, they say the menu item #. I have terrible memory, so I can never remember what number I ordered (I remember the name in Vietnamese because it's usually a staple that I order frequently).    They are really good about splitting the bill by item / person if you come here in groups as my friends and I frequently do. You just pay at the front and tell them what number dish you had. No credit cards under $10.",

Sounds like breakfast restaurant telling me they run of eggs and bacons at 06:00 AM as I just sit down in their restaurant.  Then we were out of cold water, I asked for more water. It only took 10 minutes for the water made it to our table after 8 other tables got their fresh water refilled!?!? WTF!?!?  Hunted restaurant!?

My husband usually gets the pho with rare streak only and I like to get the Hu Tieu - dry with the cellophane noodles. So far so good but once we got our food it was a different story.   Hubby's order was fine but mines came with soup. Not dry BUT with soup!   So I made a complaint to our waiter (the only older man with glasses) and he said that I DID NOT order dry noodles. And I told him I did, my husband even heard my order. The waiter also said he can not change my order because I \"didn't order it right\". And basically blaming me because I didn't order it right. Ok fine, whatever I'll just eat it so he'll be quiet. I' m not the type to start any confict. I took the first bite and wasn't happy it wasn't the dry version. It tastes totally different and I didn't bother eating it again.   Just when were about to leave to pay our bill, the waiter comes back and noticed i did not eat it and he offered to change my food. Seriously ? What happen to \"I can't change your order?\"   Anyways, I wanted to see the manager after this but they supposedly don't have a manager. So I just told the lady who managed our bill what happened and she apologized for his service. She knew who I was complaining about and I didn't even have to point out who it was. She also offered to take my order off the bill and all we had to pay was for my husband's pho. So thank you for that.   That is why today I gave it 3 stars if it wasn't for the lady upfront who helped us. It'll definitely be awhile before my husband and I come back here.",

    "text": "Their food is good and all especially their spring rolls but their service is horrid.  I may be the annoying customer that disliked where they seated me and asked to move but 1) it was right after they set waters down not like there was tons of food placed yet and 2) if their dining area wasn't so cramped and dark then the corner right next to the kitchen would have been okay.  And I may not have understood that Thai iced tea was not the same as their regular iced tea because the person who usually takes me there and orders for me was not there this time. And of course, I have to send the Thai iced tea back even though I had described to the male waiter that I wanted the \"clear\" iced tea.  But for the staff to so rudely express their exasperation with me was not just humiliating to me in front of the person I brought to THEIR restaurant but also very frustrating as a paying customer. The waiter who brought me the tea I ordered wrong literally argued with me that it was what I ordered and though I apologized and explained what I wanted, he stormed off to the front counter with it and threw his as about yelling the story to the other two waiters, one of whom always grunts and groans when you ask her for anything.  And yet I never did get the right tea until after my food came and I had to ask the youngest waiter there who is very nice and cordial.   I don't care how good their food is, I don't pay them to get treated like an unworthy peasant while families of six or seven get star treatment from these despicable two servers. Will not be returning simply because they are so unpleasant to even order from and the girl is just there to text on her cellphone in between acting bothered by customers. Pathetic.",

The place is pretty small and feels really cramped if there are more than a hndful of people inside.   As for the food itself, its alright. On my last trip here I had the chicken pho and it was good. Tasty broth and nice juicy chicken. I think there was too much cilantro in mine, but it certainly wasn't a deal breaker.  Service was okay.   I dont know, nothing was terrible, but at the same time nothing really stood out either. I think the Lemongrass Cafe nearby is probably a better choice for some good Pho.  So 3 stars it is.",

The Bun Bo Hue is not the best I've had, but definitely is one that has the most meat/pork cake/pork hock, etc inside.  It could be a little spicier, but I don't think the broth is half bad.  The grilled chicken/egg roll vermicelli bowl is pretty tasty as well, the chicken is very tender and flavorful.  There are negatives to this place, it's kind of dirty and the service is pretty bad.  Also, I've only been there a few times but definitely some inconsistencies in the dish.  One time the vermicelli bowl came without any greens....and one time I just got the regular bean sprouts when usually it's a different dish for the bun bo hue.  So not the best, but not bad for being in this area.",

This is her normal spot and my first time here. I set one foot in the door the the lady had two menus in her hand already and asked \"Two?\". Yes, but when did you even see us?! Whatever. We were seated IMMEDIATELY is what I`m getting at here and that was just fine with me. We were brought water twice(as in TWO glasses of water EACH), which was a little odd, but I figured they just didn`t want to fuss with refilling our water? Who knows. I didn`t care much about that oddity. Within about 3 minutes they came to take our order and luckily, I always know what I want. Gimmie the Pho, number 11, the one with the rare cow that cooks in the broth. You know.  Also, a Sapporo, please and thanks.   They brought my cold beer out pretty quickly but the glass wasn't cold(I know, I know. I like fancy touches, but still.) Sapporo as expected. Pho came out pretty soon after that with all the sides. I got a small and it was still pretty large. I love Pho and the bang for your buck that you get. Big bowl of broth, noodles(LOTS of noodles at this particular place), and some meat. I will say that there wasn't enough meat to satisfy my little carnivore heart, but it is what it is. The broth was AMAZING, which more than made up for the lack of meat. Add some lime to that bowl of broth = totally drinkable. So good! Some of the best Pho broth I have ever had. Noodles were..noodles. Overall, I would come back here. I found the service to be okay. They didn`t offer me another beer which was a little sad, but also helped me minimize my day drinking.",

There were two other parties that were sat after us and their order was taken and delivered before us. That part annoyed me because whenever we would call someone they would say \"I'll be right with you to take your order\" but we proceed to watch them taking orders from parties who came after us.    Anyways, the food is really good! I ordered the #70 Vermicelli bowl with pork, shrimp, and spring rolls. Their sauce for the vermicelli was delicious! I have never tasted a good vermicelli before from other restaurants so for that it'll be my go-to place. Their green onion portioning are really small so it isn't as big/ regular sized as it is at other places. They took a while to refill my water during my last couple of visits so be aware that you will have to flag down your severer a couple of times. You would have to ask for the chili garlic sauce because they don't put it out on the table with the siriacha and hoisin. My fiance's plate and mine came out to $23 with tax, not including tip. I like their vermicelli Bowl but their service are slow when they're busy.",

    "text": "Pretty good spot to get your pho fix.  Environment: similar to most Vietnamese restaurant, most people come here for a quick lunch or dinner.   Service: most of the workers are Vietnamese. I wouldn't say they are super friendly, but they get the job done. We sat down quickly, they got our orders fast and brought our food out quickly. You then pay at the front cashier before you leave.  Food: the food here is pretty good. I got the spring rolls which taste good especially with their peanut sauce. I get the pho special with the tendons tripe and flank beef. Because I was really craving pho, i really enjoyed it. The broth was delicious and the meat was good as well. They also give you the standard sprouts, mint leaves, lime, and jalapenos.   Overall, good spot to get your pho fix. It is in a convenient location, and you can eat quickly and get back to your business after.",

    "text": "Comfortable spot for some quick pho.  Environment: The inside of the restaurant isn't anything special, but it is cozy. Seating is done quickly, which is most important when grabbing a quick lunch. The only thing I would say is that when we went there, there had been no music or anything playing which did make the environment a little change. It wasn't awkwardly quiet because the sound of all the customers talking to one another at their respective tables filled the air, however some type of music playing could have been welcomed.  Food: To start we got spring rolls, which were nice and fresh just how I like them. Dipping sauce was good as well. As for the pho, they had a nice sized menu with numerous options. I like the ones with a couple different varieties of meat in it so I could get one which combined flank, rare beef, and tendon. The bowl was huge and the flavor was good. Probably was not the best pho I have ever had but it can compare to other pho spots in Vegas.  Service: Service was quick and efficient which is what I would expect. Never felt like I was waiting for anything or that it was hard to get anyone's attention so I would say that I was satisfied.  Overall I would come here again if I were in the mood for noodles and in the area (especially since Monta closed, and Henderson has a lack of noodle spots in general), however I doubt I wouldn't put it up there with my real favorite pho restaurants which I would be willing to drive farther for.",

Both are yummy and the portions are decent for the price. The sauce that comes with both is really good.   I usually get the pho with chicken and that is my favorite option here. Today I had the pho with beef and I didn't like the beef as much as the chicken. The amount of meat in all of the pho options is generous. My husband was on the fence about giving pho a try, but changed his mind when he saw how much meat comes in the bowl. The small bowl is a lot of food and I can't imagine who would be able to eat the large. I like that they bring out items to help customize your dish like bean sprouts, basil, lime, chili paste, and jalapenos. I love adding jalapenos and chili paste for a spicy dish.  The restaurant seems clean. The service isn't anything notable, but it isn't bad either. The food comes out quickly and drinks get refilled before you need to ask. I like the check out process as well. When you are finished you just go to the counter, give them your table number (a sticker on the turntable at each table), and they give you your total.",

    "text": "I've been to other Pho Saigon 8 locations, and have always had great experiences. My first time to this one off of eastern, and will certainly be my absolute last time. I ordered a beef Pho without noodles and extra vegetables for take out. My mistake for not checking the order until I got home, since they repeated the order correctly when giving me the take out. I got home to find no vegetables at all included in my order. I thought simple fix, just call them and they will simply make it right, even if it's on a future visit. The manager I spoke with was an extremely incompetent uncooperative individual. He argued with me over the phone, telling me I ordered wrong. When I responded this is the same way I always ordered at the 215 and rainbow location, and they always got it right. His rebuttal was the Rainbow and 215 location is owned by a different owner, and there is nothing he can do for me. Being a business owner myself, it was apparent this establishment has someone that has no customer service skills in a high position. So at that point I just ended the call. He didn't have a care in the world, as if to say \"It's not my business\" As a business owner these are the type of people you do not want in a management position, because it is a very bad reflection on the business. So customers beware check your orders before leaving when you order take out.",

Out of the last three times we came the waiter (the same one each time) didn't take our drink orders, was very impatient while we were ordering, and my wife had to chase down a different waiter for water. FYI, all three times the waiter was that fat one that another reviewer found very rude/short. Speaking about the wait staff, did someone scare off all the female employees?  The strangest part is that food is exactly the same: fantastic. I wish Yelp would let us differentiate between the food, place, and staff as the food would easily get 5 stars while the staff (well, that staff that's left) would get 1.  It's very rare that I'd let the wait staff get to me as usually a return visit gets me a different waiter, but this place is so small that's not an option. Right now I'll just resign myself to finding a different Pho place.",

The noodles are a hit or miss and since I'm a big noodle eater, this matters to me. Sometimes they are soggy but sometimes they are perfect. Though the broth is consistent and is one of the best in Vegas, making this place one of the few solid pho places around Vegas.   It is still not up to par with LA pho places, but as I have said in other reviews I have yet to eat at a pho place in Vegas that measures up.  The only thing that is below average, even for an asian restaurant (which says a lot), is the service.   I am used the okay service of asian restaurants where the waitresses are often overwhelmed with too many customers and often forget things and don't have enough time to give you a lot of time, so that doesn't bother me. What does bother me is when a worker is walking around like he has nothing and they purposely ignores you. I ordered a pho from one guy working there and never ended up getting my order. He even avoided me and purposely ignored me when I tried to catch his attention . Finally another server saw me and promptly got my order, at least she was very nice. I wish I could say that this only happened to me once (and I would be willing to overlook it since I come here often) but it was not the only time and he was not the only guy that did that.",

I do love to have soda and they serve soda here in a can which is not as tasty to me as fountain and this means you will have to pay for refills......  Check this place out!",

Service...haha get ready. Ordered drinks and food. Our food comes out first so I'm waiting for our drinks. 5 mins go by..nothing. So I asked the waiter (the really fat one) and he gives this irritates look on his face and says \"IT'S COMING!\" well alright jeez. People normally get their drinks before their foods, fatso. ESP with pho...all that MSG, you need a drink with it! The others weren't really any better. We went around 9pm and I guess they were closing soon. Felt like they were trying to rush everyone out. Well hello! You're in Vegas! You expect people to have early dinner times? Whatever. The only reason we tipped is because we had a kid with us and she made a mess with her rice -__-  Their prices are so weird! 6.05 7.05 8.05 dude seriously? You are so stingy you have to do .05. I guess that .05 really helps the owner out but seriously? I've never seen more ridiculous prices. This place is already way more expensive than many other pho places. And having that .05 on the menu just makes em look more stingy.",

My usual go-to when out and about is Pho Kim Long but my office is located very close to Pho Saigon 8, so as a captive audience it certainly satisfies when craving pho for lunch.   The service definitely leaves a lot to be desired in that no dialog is created (at least the times I have been here) and \"friendly\" isn't an adjective I would use to describe the employees.  That said, I'm not here to make friends, I want to eat soupl. And Pho Saigon 8 provides piping hot, delicious pho in less than 2 mins of putting in your order.",

    "text": "To all the people who say I should expect bad service because it is a Vietnamese restaurant, I'm sorry you feel that way. If I walk into a place to spend money, I shouldn't feel like a jerk for inconveniencing them. If you hate your job, quit. I work in a restaurant, too, and I know we all have bad days, but nobody should feel unwelcome when they want to spend their money and enjoy lunch. To put it shortly, the service was awful. We walked in and were sat, and before our menus were open the giant guy who sat us was already asking if we were ready. Not yet, guy. So he walks away, does a loop around the tiny restaurant, and 30 seconds later asks if we are ready. Repeat twice. Then, he got annoyed, sneezed into his hand, and never came back (thank goodness.)   When we did finally order, I got Veggie spring rolls and bun with egg rolls. Spring rolls were yummy, no complaint there. My noodles though... soggy lettuce and warm noodles, eek.  My boyfriend ordered a pork stew over egg noodles, but what he got was gigantic chunks of pork fat. That's just gross. I took a picture of the scooped out fat... probably about 8 oz of fat and 3 oz of actual pork meat. I think most would agree that less quantity and more quality is preferable to more waste and less quality. When my food lovin' non-picky eater of a boyfriend barely touches a meal, there's an issue. Even he was grossed out by the bad quality.  I'll just keep going to Pho Kim Long in China Town. It's a longer drive, but at least I didn't get treated like I kicked someone's pet as soon as I walked in, and the food is fresh and yummy.",

    "text": "I come from the Bay Area in Northern California, so I was surrounded by so many Vietnamese restaurants growing up and I absolutely love the Vietnamese cuisine. So, since I've moved to Vegas, I've been in the search for my regular Vietnamese spot for whenever I'm craving pho or a vermicelli dish.   Food: As I tried Pho Saigon, I was a bit disappointed. I ordered the chicken pho and spring rolls. I usually always order size small when I get pho, but Pho Saigon only does size large, which sucks because I ended up wasting half of my soup. Plus, I was really disappointed for spending so much when I didn't eat it all (my cravings were too strong, I needed to buy pho!). Also, the broth was lacking flavor, and trust me, I love my pho so this really was mediocre. Well, moving onto my spring rolls.. the meat was so dry.. thank god I was able to drench each bite into the peanut sauce and sriracha, cos I couldnt just eat it by itself.   Service: I called in for a pick up order and the lady was in such a rush! Once I said my order, she quickly said, \"okay give me 10 minutes\" and hung up. Lol, she didn't give me a price for my order or anything, which made me not even want to go and pick up my order because I actually wanted to make sure I was getting a small size. When I arrived I said I was there for pick up and the lady said the price and it was about $17 for pho and spring rolls, so I know forsure it wasnt a small. I asked how much the price was for a small and that was when she informed me that they do not have small sizes. If I had known that from when I made the order on the phone, I would have said nevermind and didn't order at all because I forsure wouldn't finish that and I didn't want to spend that much on something I wont finish. But because I am not rude, I paid and accepted it anyway.   Probably gonna try a different Pho joint because this just wasn't what I was expecting from reading all the good reviews.. very disappointed.",

    "text": "I came here for lunch with several co-workers. The weather is cold and what better time than that to get some pho. We came around noon since my coworker mentioned they get pretty busy.   The decor is nice and they keep the place pretty clean. I wasn't in a soup eating mood, so I decided on a vermicelli bowl. My other coworker ordered some eggrolls to share and they were pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but they had a nice crunch. My vermicelli bowl was a little lackluster. I usually enjoy all the nice crunchy vegetables that are included and this one just included a few leaves of lettuce and some sprouts. Definitely not what I had hope for. The pork and shrimp were ok, but definitely not one of best bowls I've encountered.   Since they are the closest pho place to work, I'll probably give them another shot, but I'll try their pho next time. The prices are a little on the high side, but I guess that's pretty typical for the Henderson area. For now, I can't give them much beyond three stars.",

The noodles are on point too.  My order is always to my table in like 5 mins, and my water glass is never empty, just make it visible on your table cuz they can get really busy.  If you want a nice hot filling meal, come here.  I live close, so it's my go-to pho spot.",

    "text": "Good place to go for pho if you're craving noodles and not in Chinatown. My friends and I went here on a Saturday night, and were pleased that it wasn't too busy. After perusing the menu, my friend and I decided to split a large #11 (Pho Tai- Noodle soup with rare round eye steak, $7.50) while my other friend ordered the #67 (Bun Ga Nuong- Grilled chicken over vermicelli and vegetables, $7.45). I asked for extra bean sprouts to which the waiter didn't seem to have a problem with. Our food came out quickly, which was a plus.   Pho Tai- Better here than other pho places in the neighborhood. The noodles were the perfect texture- not overcooked, but still soft with a chewy bite. The soup was a little more oily (I could see oil puddles floating on the top) than what I'm used to, but still good and hot nonetheless. And the accompanying plate of veggies & herbs (bean sprouts, basil & lemon (not technically a vegetable or herb...) was fresh. The portion size was good- plenty of noodles & meat- with the addition of bean sprouts, I was definitely full.   Bun Ga Nuong- I only tried the grilled chicken, which I thought was flavorful and very teriyaki-y, but some of the pieces that I ate had too much fat on them; however, I liked the sweetness and charred flavor of the chicken.   I didn't really feel like the service was bad. I mean it did take a while for them to bring the check, but my friends and I didn't really have a problem with that because we were too busy talking. I thought the servers were nice. I also like how this place is cleaner than other pho restaurants I've been to. So I think I'll come back when I'm craving pho not only because the food is good, but because it's located right next to my favorite frozen yogurt shop.",

Being first timers, we asked our waitress her favorites on the menu. She was so helpful, nice and patient with us as we decided on our order. Our food came out quick, hot and tasty. Our drinks were refilled in a timely manner and our waitress checked on us a couple times to make sure we were satisfied and liked our food.  The least friendly person in the whole place was the cashier. He didn't say anything to us except to tell us our total. He didn't even offer me my receipt, I had to ask him for it.... probably not a big deal to most people, but I expected the great service until I walked out the door.   We'll definitely go back to try other things.",

    "text": "I'm from southern californa, and I'm vietnamese so I think I've had my fair share of \"authentic\" vietnamese food, and I think Pho Saigon 8 does a pretty good job. And for a decent price too!   I've gotten the Pho Bo Vien (meat ball Pho) which was good. The broth was a good flavor. I always add tons of lemon and Hoisin Sauce anyway.   And I've had their Rice platter with grilled pork (Thit Nuong) and egg rolls. I thought the meat was awesome. It had a good flavor and the egg rolls were pretty good too. My one complaint is that the rice wasn't your typical \"broken rice\" where the rice pieces are smaller. They served whole rice grains, which is fine but I was really looking foward to the traditional Com Tam.  My fiance has gotten their Bun Thit Nuong (Dry noodle bowl with grilled pork) and he didn't have any complaints. The fish sauce (Nuoc Mam) was decent, nothing too spectacular.   And the service isn't too bad either. I've gone when they've been pretty busy and I thought the service was moderately attentive. Overall this is a great place to go when you're craving a nice steaming bowl of noodle soup or just some good ole vietnamese food and you're too lazy to drive down to Spring Mountain haha.",

Reason #2 - They are from \"Saigon\", where pho was invented, so you know they know what they are doing here.  Reason #3 - The number \"8\" is a very humbling number to give ones self. It's better then 5 and not as douchey as 10.  So you know they've got class.  Yup, the humblest, most authenticest, phoiest restaurant on Eastern. Much better than Pho Saigon 7 and less pretentious then Pho Saigon 9.    Till next Tuesday Pho Saigon 8, when my parents will pay for my dinner again!!",

I routinely get the number 11. It comes with a plate of different garnishes such as bean sprouts, mint leaves, and sliced jalapeno peppers.  I add plumb sauce and saracha for an extra added kick that broadens the journey through taste town.  It tastes like life. It's a spiritual journey for me every time I dive into a bowl of this magic bone broth, thin sliced raw meat, and noodles. It's always clean and I've never had to wait to be seated.  The place stays full with a steady stream of regulars and workout veterans from across the parking lot. The cafe ser da is another amazing coffee treat that will spark off your day proper.  I've had a few other items off the menu, all of which were rich with flavor and filling. The meals are reasonably-priced and the service has always been superior. If you are a fan of delicious food from Veit Nam, a stop by here won't dissapoint. Lastly, don't fear the fish sauce.",

Everything is very clean and fast-paced.  I'm a very picky eater and have a hard time most places when it comes to getting my order right but never once have they messed up my order... I even order to go confidently knowing they won't screw things up. The service is very fast for such a busy place and they're polite to my standards they make sure your cup is filled and like most Vietnamese restaurants are trying to get you fed and taken care of not make small talk to butter you up for a big tip (which I think many people are not used to and see it as bad service instead of doing a good job and efficiency ) which I find genuine and worth a bigger tip. If you do ever order to go make sure to ask for any extra sauce you may want because you only get what you order.",

Having said that, this restaurant is a good substitute of Orange County Vietnamese food.    Most non-Vietnamese will come here for pho, and their beef pho is good.  But their chicken pho is better.  You can order it with white meat or dark meat or a combination of both.  I prefer the combination.  You can also get Mien Ga, which is a noodle soup with the chicken pho broth and bean thread noodle, very healthy and yummy (bean thread noodle is a good source of fiber).    Another good dish here is the Hu Tieu My Tho, which is a noodle soup with pork broth, clear & chewy rice noodle, topped with shrimp, calamari, ground pork, and quail eggs.  It is a very authentic dish from south Vietnam and Pho Saigon 8 has a very good version.    As with most Vietnamese restaurants, the service can be slow and sporadic but the decor is nicer than many other Vietnamese restaurants in town.  I really recommend this place if you are in the Southeast side of Vegas.",

I've been told by my Vietnamese friends that this place is some what \"Americanized.\" I guess I can see that....Oh and did I mention, at one point I was mortified to order from here because of their grade 'C'  rating?

    "text": "My favorite place for Pho! I can always count on hot meals and quick wait times at this location. My family has been eating here since 2011 and all of them like the Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls. I love seafood, so my faves are #63 (Shrimp w/Vermicelli Rice Noodles and lots of veggies) and #43 (Pho w/Shrimp and Crab meat and choice of egg/rice noodles). The price and service is decent. Sometimes the servers seem short with their tone, so that might offend someone who wants to chat or make small talk. It doesn't bother me since I normally order take out these days - they do have high chairs if you have young children and opt to dine in the restaurant.",

The broth is so flavorful on it's own, I don't really need to use the condiments to enhance it. Their Vietnamese Coffee (I think it's called Cafe Sua?) is the best Vietnamese Coffee I've ever had.   Also, their non pho dishes are just as delicious. Sometimes I order a no 65: Bun with grilled pork, which is kind of like a cold noodle salad. And their egg fried rice is one of the best fried rices I've tasted.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants really good Pho in Vegas",

I told him we are not ready we just got here. He comes back constantly within a min urging us to order. He did not ask us what we wanted to drink. I felt judged and treated horribly. The flat affect and unprofessionalism of the employees here has finally ended my love of their food. I will no longer come back and as slow as it was I am not surprised.

    "text": "This is my usual go to pho place close to home. The restaurant is clean, they get you seated quickly and the portions are fair. Make sure you take note that the pho prices on their menu are for the \"large\" bowl but by default they give you the regular size if you don't ask.   They have the best taste and value fresh spring rolls (they have pork and shrimp inside) I've had so far in Vegas. Seems so simple but yet other places can't seem to pull it off.  This place is pretty much a get in, eat, get out and get on with your life type of business. The service interaction is fairly minimal (which I actually like in some situations) so don't expect any small talk. They bring you some water, take your order, bring your food and you pay yourself at the counter when you're ready. If you need something else just flag them down and they'll help you. It helps if you know your table number which is labeled but they generally know which table is yours.  Your best bet is to do your homework on what dishes you may want to try, then go in and order by number.  If you're into really thick and strong coffee, give the Vietnamese ice coffee a try. I'll try to post a video of it brewing - it takes quite some time to funnel its way down into the glass so you can dump it in your ice but it's worth the wait.  My biggest beef with Pho Saigon 8 is that their Spring Mountain location is subpar and inconsistent in food taste/quality.  I will however visit this location any day of the week.  PS- if you like pork chops marinated in fish sauce and grilled.. It's absolutely wonderful here. Another popular item is any of the bun - rice noodle (no soup) dishes. Be sure to try it with the sweet chili sauce!",

    "text": "Close to the house, I frequent this restaurant when in need for something not super heavy to eat.  Overall it is one of the better Vietnamese restaurants around my neighborhood.  It actually gets pretty busy at times since it's in the LVAC parking lot.  A fair amount of seating, but we usually get take out.  Check your order though because we have on multiple occasions received the wrong order, and let's just say they were annoyed with us and claimed we got it wrong.  We always get their fresh spring rolls, and they provide a generous amount of peanut hoison dipping sauce in the to go order.  The rolls are also fairly sizable.  Not the best I have ever had, but consistent and hit the spot.  I get the vermicelli noodles with the grilled pork.  However I always get it to eat the next day because they always cook their noodles to long, and they firm up over night.  The pork is flavorful and tender, but the naoc mam (fish sauce) is fairly basic. I wish they used more herbs, garlic, shallots etc to add some extra punch to their noodle bowls.  My boyfriend appreciates that they have the Vietnamese rice porridge (chao) on request, but I prefer his mothers.  This one doesn't have that much of a flavor to me, and I get bored eating it quickly.  He also prefers their pho here above a lot of places in the valley.  They give a large amount of basil and and limes on the side unlike some places.  He always gets the combo.  They have some good jelly desserts that are tasty, a bit sweet, but less sweet than a lot of other restaurants.  They are a good spot when you don't feel like driving further into China town. Although I don't feel I have been to a Vietnamese spot in Las Vegas that has totally blown my mind yet, despite the many selections that have been popping up.",

    "text": "Disclaimer- The food is definitely four stars, but the service is one to two stars depending on the day. Therefore, I'm giving Pho Saigon 8 an overall rating of three stars.  My mom and I have been coming to Pho Saigon 8 since my family first moved to the valley, almost four years ago, and the customer service over the years has just gotten progressively worse. The staff was great when we first started coming here and then as of lately, the staff has just been rude and unpleasant to be served by. Although this restaurant is not close to home, we still drive the distance when we have that craving! We used to come at least once a week, but now every other month or so.  We usually come for lunch on the weekend, so it's always busy during that time. The wait time can be a hit or miss.  I am a creature of habit and order the same exact thing every time. I order the #11 (Pho Tai) which is the broth, noodles, and rare eye round. As far as the pho goes, the broth is always hot and never warm like other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to. It's rich in flavor and there is a good amount of rice noodles in the soup. I love the rare eye round because it's not fatty. A plate of garnishes are provided for the table to share. The traditional Thai basil, jalapenos, lime, and my favorite, crunchy bean sprouts. I love my pho with extra lime, and if more garnishes are needed, you can always ask for more! You might have to ask more than once though because they can be quite forgetful. Also, condiments are a must! A nice squeeze of Sriracha and Hoisin always go into my pho.  If I'm hungrier than usual, I'll order a plate of the crispy fried egg rolls to share. The crispy fried spring rolls are a favorite amongst my family! There are four per order and it comes with four leaves of fresh lettuce as well as the dipping sauce. I'm not too sure what the dipping sauce is made of, but it's delicious! The spring rolls are filled with pork and a variety of veggies.  Overall, the best place for pho in the Henderson area! The food is great and satisfies my craving every time. The service isn't the best, but it'll do.",

It was hot, crunchy, and fluffy! From the first bite, it made me say \"daammn\" hahaha.. yes it is that delicious!! Also the crepe was perfectly cooked and very decent filling! I was really glad that it was not OILY! unlike the one at pho kim long it was soaking in oil (totally disgusting) but anyways the service was nice too! Fast and on point!   So if you're looking for an authentic viet food in henderson this is a must go to place! And they also have another location at spring mtn.

One thing I looooveeee about the soup is that you can taste the richness of the soup, meaning it took many hours to make it into its thick tendinous consistency, which is very hard to find in today's American money hungry culture!

    "text": "There are many-a pho restaurants that seem to be on every corner of Eastern and the 215.  My friend had heard that this was a decent spot for a bowl of pho and upon arrival I was happy to note that it was not too crowded.  Once we were seated, we ordered 2 small bowls... I can't recall the number, but it was with the rare flank steak.  The bowls came out quickly and I requested some nuoc mam sauce and lettuce to put in my soup.  Our server brought back the sauce, but not the lettuce.  I guess it's my fault for not calling him back to the table... The taste of the soup was good.  Not the best pho I have ever eaten, but decent.  The restaurant began to fill up for the lunch rush while we were eating, so I guess we got there just in time.  Our check was dropped off at the table without a word and since we had never been there we weren't really sure if we should go up to the register or wait.  We opted to walk up to the front, which seemed to be the right decision.  I then saw a sign that said Debit/Credit transactions must be over $10 and my soup was only around $7.  I expressed my concern and the lady and the register gruffly told me that I would have to add a tip... which of course I was intending on doing, but the tone and demeanor in which she said it was kind of off.  I'm not sure if I will return because I want to try out some other pho restaurants on that side of town.",

It is always busy so that says something.  The food is really delicious and such big portions. You are definitely full when you leave.  I decided to take the wife and kids to broaden their horizons. It was an experience watching them look at all the condiments like the basil, lime, jalapenos and sprouts and wondering how they were going to use them.  I had the chicken and seafood pho, it was just as delicious as the first time I had it, with perfectly cooked shrimp and quail eggs floating around for a great rich touch. The broth is so flavorful.  The kids all had the chicken pho. They weren't sure how to eat it. I told them slurping was OK, just in here though..lol  My wife unfortunately didn't eat anything because the old man either didn't understand her when she said vegetarian and asked if they had rice noodles. He kept showing her items on the menu with chicken and just didn't get it.  So that sucked  It was a great experience for the children and I stopped someplace after for the wife.  Service is basic is all I can say. He takes the order, and drops the check off when you are done.  Next time, I want to find a place that clearly says what vegetarian options they have so my wife can enjoy with us...",

We ordered fried rice and found a hair in it.  My main disappointment with this place was how they overcharged me.  My total was $45 and some change.  I paid with a $100 bill and got back $44.  Tell me does that equal a Benjamin?  Yeah, tell me that y'all deserve an $11 tip is total BS.  Man I was ready to slap a bitch.    So, I go back to the register and tell the older gentleman, I guess the owner, that the young guy that rung me up gave me the wrong change and showed him the change I received.  The older man was apologetic and corrected the error and said that they didn't mean to do it cause it was busy. But, when I went to pay it had already died down.  The young guy that rung me up didn't even apologize that he did wrong and fkd up even as the owner tried getting his attention.    If y'all are wondering if I left them a tip, the answer is HELL to the NO, would any of you after that stunt?  I simply just smiled and walked out.    Since y'all hungry for tip here's one: teach your employees to calculate your customers' bills correctly.   Basic arithmetic isn't really that hard, you can learn from YouTube and I ain't got time for y'all's . To say the least I will no longer be requiring your services.  Bye Felicia.",

    "text": "A bowl of noodles as filling and satisfying as a Thanksgiving dinner!  After spending 12 years living in Southeast Asia there is one simple meal that I miss most, a simple bowl of noodles.  Pho Saigon 8 will be my local bowl for authentic Asian noodle soup. Their noodle soups are spot on.  I had the Pho Tai Chin, rare and well cooked beef noodle soup. There are two size options, small or large for .50 cents more. The large double the size of the small and is helmet sized steaming bowl of satisfying noodle goodness.  Before the soup arrives the server delivers the vegetable condiments that you can use to customize your bowl, don't be shy, add them all, the flavors and freshness they add lifts the noodles to a heavenly level. Also, don't forget to spice things up with a healthy squirt of Sriracha and a salty dose of hoisin sauce. There is also a wickedly delightful bowl of chili garlic sauce that adds a solid hit of heat, garlic and a touch of sour. The rare thin sliced beef sirloin rests on top of the perfectly cooked rice noodles. Once you stir the beef into the bowl, the rare beef becomes medium well in the steaming hot broth, tender, fresh - scrumptious. The depth of flavors is uber stimulating to the palate and the sheer volume of food is tummy satisfying. You may need a nap if you finish the whole bowl!  My wife enjoyed the Hu tieu hay Mi Dac Biet (pork soup with seafood with egg noodles). She agreed, a fantastic, tasty, satisfying bowl of noodles. The egg noodles are thin and curly. She commented that the squid was fresh and cooked perfectly.  For an authentic taste of Southeast Asia, Pho Saigon 8 can't be beat.  Their menu is extensive and includes many other non-noodle dishes that we will certainly be returning to try. We just couldn't handle anything else on top of our hot tub sized bowl of noodles!  Aloha!",

I will agree not the best I have had but still good and definately worth going back.   Tried a few things and the Bun Bo hue was hit and miss, first time soup was bland second time it was great.   Service is usually bad but with most asian places its the norm, asian people go for the food not the service.   One thing that was really good is the Nem (forgot the second word), ifs the pink meatballs that are not cooked (I think) with the raw garlic and chili in it. They serve it over vermacilli in one of thier bun dishes... that was good but only if you know vietnamese food. Bun bo Hue and raw Nem is not for the first timers.   I would return again.",

    "text": "Pho Saigon 8: Eastern and 215 Location (Eastern and Pebble)  Let's start with the constructive criticism.  It's smaller places, parking is a little tight otherwise you are parking in the LVAC parking lot.  And most of the servers might have a little trouble speaking English but not all and the owner is usually on-site and very fluent.  Now for the more important stuff, good food, and great price.  I've noticed you seem to get a little more for your buck here than I've seen at other viet restaurants and the food always comes out quick.  Spring mountain location: Same as above for food, good food for the price, parking is worse though if you go when it's busy but seating is much better and it's larger to accomodate groups.   Extra info: I guess the things I'm not crazy about but they aren't unique to either location is if you want to substitute something it's a huge no no, at best you can just have things removed.  And I think the soup only comes in a mainstream size, maybe not quite large but you can't order a small but some dishes come with a small size of Pho minus the meat.",

I once sat down and shuffled my chair forward and my hand was covered in something slimy. Its disgusting smell forced me to head to the restroom and wash my hands repeatedly. I will take the advice of other reviewers and try out Lemongrass nearby.",

Just in the last few weeks since it's opened I've tried some new stuff like the #2 veggie spring rolls which had some good tofu inside, #7 Banh Xeo which I really liked (its like putting a savory, greasy shrimp pancake inside a lettuce wrap and then adding fresh mint and dipping into sauce) and the #73 Bun Bo Hue which was a little underwhelming.

The pho broth is everything. It ties it all in.  Pho is a PIA to make if you don't have a pressure cooker.  I can appreciate the variety and toppings of pho. I literally can eat pho everynight.  I think when winter rolls around and the next time I catch a cold, I'll see if pho can be a good alternative for chicken soup.

He came back two minutes later and asked for our order and again we asked for a few more minutes because there's like a thousand items on the menu and it was my first time there. We finally ordered and the waitress came out and brought our food since our waiter was on his break having his meal at the table in front us us. We had the pho ga, shrimp spring rolls, and shrimp fried rice. Everything was absolutely delicious! When we asked the waitress for another order of shrimp spring rolls, she brought them back to us in a to-go box. I guess she wanted us to leave so we left since we were done with their crap. This place really needs to work on their customer service. The entire time both waiters had an attitude and a mad look on their face.

On complaining to the server about the foul taste and requesting to change the dish, they blatantly refused. I told them that I had not tried the dish, and the smell told the entire story. They refused a refund or change to a different dish, and had me reorder a second dish and pay for both.  This is one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant considering I eat out at least once a day. They have probably lost more than one customer today as the friends who were with me were baffled at this as well and have decided not to go back to the place.",

Lately they've been a little slow when it comes to taking my order but they never fail when it comes to bringing out the food quickly. I also highly recommend their fried rice... Just trust me, you'll looove it!! I've never gone to any other pho place and I'm honestly okay with that because this place just works for me! Lol.

When I walked up to the register the guy charged me for a large one ... After arguing with him as to what I ordered and what I got, he took two steps to the side checked my table and said yeah that's a big one ... I walked back there and took a big one from another table and put it next to it, he still charged me for a big one. It is a dollar, I don't want to argue with stupid people but I won't go there again. Way to go playing with a customer that was there at least once a week ! Finding another place right now ...",

Service was very slow, they squashed us in a side table even though there were plenty of other seats, and didn't really explain WTF we were supposed to be doing.  For instance, I guess you are supposed to be wrapping the egg rolls in the large pieces of lettuce they give you??? They give you a BUNCH of stuff to doctor up your soup with, which I guess should've been my first indication that it wasn't going to be all that good.  DON'T GET THE MEATBALLS. They were nasty. Apparently, there's some confusion on meatballs and sausage in a casing?  You literally had to bite and tear into these packets of meat to get a chunk off of them. It definitely reminded me of eating an overcooked piece of sausage and way too big to be eating in one bite.  The Thai Tea was amazing but I felt for it's size, extremely over priced. In fact, the whole thing was a bit overpriced, it was almost $40 for 3 of us for lunch without tip. Trying to get the check was a production too, then paying the check up at the front, then tipping was all very strange.  I think we all agreed we don't have to go back.",

When we walked in, it was packed so we had to wait a little bit.  We ordered the crispy egg rolls as an appetizer to share.  He ordered the Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Ve Don Noodle soup with rare eye round steak, flank, brisket, soft tendon & skirt flank; and I ordered Pho Chin Bo Vien Noodle soup with well done lean meat & beef meatballs.  The food came out pretty fast, but once we got our food, it seemed a bit difficult to flag someone down when we wanted to pay.

Most ph shops pump so many people through them that even if you frequent them 1-2x per week (like I tend to) they never bother to treat you like a regular or give too much effort. To most restaurants you're just another hungry mouth to feed and get a tip from. Not Ph Saigon 8!

But that won't stop me from coming here since the food is yummy! I always get an order of Fresh Spring Rolls and Combination Pho #18 with no eye round/no cilantro. I'm not a fan of the sweeter side pho broth. Their broth has a more savory taste to it which I like. The spring rolls have a good crunch from the shredded lettuce and they don't skimp on the meat unlike other restaurant do. The restaurant also offers other great food options like grilled pork with rice and combination fried rice that are very delicious as well.

Service is generally okay. I usually get my food about 10 minutes or less after putting in my order. I have tried their fresh spring rolls, they're not bad, though their sauce could use some improvement. They also do to-go orders, but I'm not sure about phone orders.  Ambiance is like your usual asian restaurant, although no matter how many times I have been there, I just can't recall whether they had music or not. It's also good for family, they can push tables together to accommodate a large party, and I think they have a different section for larger parties too.  I wish they had some kind of promo or discount for frequent customers. I'll be back again when my tummy craves for pho.",

Somehow, the hu tieu and pho came out first before the appetizer. We asked if it was a mistake and the waiter told us that because the banh xeo takes a long time so it had to come after the entrees. I got confused because the appetizer should come before the main entrees. Anyway, the wait for it was not worth it. The banh xeo was dry , cold, and not crispy. The hu tieu was salty but luckily their pho is still decent. I am not sure I will come back anytime soon.",

    "text": "This used to be our go to spot for pho, especially when the whole family is in town, but we took about a yearlong hiatus after we had a couple of bad experiences with service and decided to head down the street for our Vietnamese. We came back recently and the food was good and the service was better because we went during a non peak time. It will usually be busy when you go in, and because of this, service can be inattentive. Generally, your server will also be curt with you, that's the way they always have been and I don't see that changing anytime soon.  The pho here is consistently good. Everyone in my family, except for a select few, always order pho. I usually get #16 (I am not going to remotely attempt to spell any of the dishes) which is rare eye round, flank, and brisket. They'll bring you as much of the accouterments needed for your soup also. Even though it doesn't take them long to bring out your bowl once you order, you can tell the broth has been cooking for hours. The deep beef flavor is easily detectable along with the aroma of spices like star anise and clove. A big squeeze of sriracha for heat is the only other thing that I usually add to my soup.  I have had a few of their rice plates and they are satisfactory. The kids will always want an order of shredded pork spring rolls to start and they usually don't last too long. Pricing is affordable, usually right around $$ per person depending how many large bowls and sodas are ordered. Heads up also, check your bill before you pay because they'll tack on 15% gratuity for your party (it may be posted on a small sign in the front) and not say a word when they give you the check or after you've signed off on an extra 20% tip. Ultimately it's our fault for not looking over the check, but you're welcome Pho Saigon 8.  The pho is good enough to keep us coming back occasionally, but not good enough to overcome the service to make us regular visitors.",

I love Vietnamese bun because it's not only tasty, but very healthy as it's not greasy and comes with all sorts of vegetables and herbs. Every bite is refreshing and appetizing; a noodle dish that is both filling and satisfying. Most people who have tried Vietnamese food are familiar with Pho, unfortunately for me it's fun to say but not to eat, I've just never had a taste for it.  So, if you're like me and have family and friends who dig Pho give this dish a try.  You're welcome!  And don't forget the Thai tea with boba.",

    "text": "So I had pho once in my life, it was seafood, I didn't like it and that was back in California. I, in my never ending quest to \"try new things\" went out for Vietnamese with my sister after coming up empty at Whole Foods.   I've passed by this place a million times and have wanted to try it. Again, even if I don't like something the first time, I try to try it in a different preparation again at another time. We walked inside, it was nice, clean, and we were seated promptly. My sister decided she wasn't hungry and didn't want to try anything so she ordered a side of rice. I ordered a #73 (I have no idea what the real name was.) The description said it was spicy. The waitress told me it had pig's blood in it. Was I a little hesitant, yeah, but I ordered it anyway.  My sister's rice was delivered to our table in about 2 seconds, along with the mint and lettuce for my pho. About 5 minutes later, the soup came out. I was completely unfamiliar with the two gray black cubes of ??? and the white pate like half circle floating on the side. Apparently, according to the waitress, it was pig's blood sausage and another type of sausage. I had to skip the blood sausage. I couldn't bring myself to try it. The pork in it, well, I couldn't identify what part of the animal it was from. The fat was very rare.   Was the soup spicy? No. I had to add a ton of siracha to my soup, along with the jalapenos. Would I go there again? Maybe, but I would for sure try something else. What I ordered was not something that had a lot of depth of flavor.",

Luckily, there were only 2 small slices of it, and plenty of the other 2 meats, so now I know -- next time I'll stick with the round and meatballs.   The basil and sprouts that came with the pho were THE FRESHEST I've seen at any pho restaurant, with no brown spots on the basil, and no yellow tinge on the sprouts.  I started with the BBQ pork rolls, which are like spring rolls but with pork instead of shrimp.  At first, I thought the meat was Spam, but it wasn't salty enough, more like thick bologna.  I've had pork rolls elsewhere where the meat was recognizable.  The peanut sauce for the rolls was thin, and not as flavorful as I'd like.  I tried a drink made of raw egg white, seltzer and condensed milk, and it was delicious.  The staff was good -- some were friendly and others were serious, but the service was excellent.",

    "text": "I'm not really a Pho eater. I don't eat meat. My friend wanted Pho so we went to this place.   It was my first time here. Inside looked like a typical Vietnamese restaurant with a silk flower decor thing going on. As you enter there's a little waterfall pond with good luck coins that people tossed in and an offering of Rambutan fruits near by.  I look over menu and have questions.  This young girl comes to our table. I ask her (pointing to the picture) does this have meat in it? She replies, huh? I ask again. She replies, egg roll. I say, right, does it have meat? She replies, meat and points to shrimp roll.  She stared at me with a puzzled look. Then my friend said, can you bring someone here who speaks English.   This guy comes over. I ask about egg roll and shrimp roll. He said they can make both without meat, they add tofu. I said great. A different guy came by to take our order. I ordered the tofu roll and I wanted egg roll without meat. The guy tells me, no we cannot make that without meat, it's premixed. Huh? I'm like, ok whatever. Then the guy points to a picture of vermicelli noodle with tofu and veggies. I told him ok I'll try it.  Food was good! I really enjoyed the tofu with vermicelli noodles and veggies, round onion, peanuts and fish sauce on the side. It was very tasty. The tofu was fried in a sweet marinade. The tofu roll was delicious too. My friend enjoyed her pho with beef brisket and egg rolls.   Overall food was good. Ambience ok. Service was ok. I will definitely come back here to eat again.",

Pho Saigon 8 on Eastern is by far one of the BEST pho's in Vegas!! The broth is on point. The vegetables (mint, bean sprouts, lettuce) are always fresh and abundant (lots of pho restaurants have wilted veggies). The meat is fresh and abundant as well.   I've been coming here for years, and recently, over the last couple years, they have been upgrading the decor, furniture and overall cleanliness of this location. So now, not only is the pho amazing, the restaurant environment is being transformed. The owner is making the right choices.   Service is good. But beware, if your used to the American way of service, this is not it. At a Vietnamese restaurant, they are all about efficiency. The quickly take your order, and in minutes you start receiving your food. Which is good, because if you have little kids and babies, the wicker the better.   My favorite pho is #16 which is rare meat, flank and brisket. Most people get the Pho Tai (not sure what number that is). And make sure to get the fried egg rolls, they make it just like my mom makes them.",

Luckily, I lived in Henderson at the time so I ended up here a lot.  No matter where I lived, I ended up coming here for pho.  When my family moved to Vegas, they started to come here as well.  There have been a lot of swings in terms of what rating I'd give this place.  10 years ago, it was 5 for food, 3 for ambiance.  5 years ago, 4 for food and 2 for ambiance.  Today, 3 or food and 4 for ambiance.    Steady decline in terms of food quality but the remodel has made the place look more modern and really nice.  I still think the broth here is fantastic but I noticed the meat is not so nice anymore.    The egg rolls are still amazing but the spring rolls... not so much.    The service is exactly the same.  A lot of attention at first but once you get your food, you'll be lucky if you can even flag anyone down for anything.",

We were seated right away, during the busy lunch hour - which was a great sign because we were hangry.   The overall ambiance was nice; the restaurant was clean and they already had hot sauces and condiments on the tables which was nice. There's nothing like having to constantly ask for seconds and thirds for hot sauce, so much easier when they have it ready on the table :)   We placed our order and literally within minutes the server was at our table delivering our yummy hot pho soups! I thought it was the wrong table but noooo, it was our order. My immediate spoon full of broth was almost close to perfect. The broth is very, very flavorful with just the perfect amount of temperature. My thin pieces of beef had a thin border of fat, just the way I love it. The noodles were a different kind of texture that I'm used to, but I'm not complaining - the pho here is delish!",

Needless to say, I was a little disappointed with the pho here. Also, I wasn't sure if the staff working there were actually Vietnamese or not. Going off what most people were raving about, I went with the pho ga and my friend did a pho tai gan (tendon). The consistency of the noodles were mushy and soft, which is not how I would normally eat my pho. The chicken also didn't come with any dipping sauce, and the broth after awhile gave me a slight headache. The beef pho was all right, nothing special. My expectations for pho are pretty low in Nevada, but this particular restaurant was just lacking so much.",

    "text": "At the intersection of 215 & Eastern. Came here a couple of days after a less-than-thrilling experience at \"Pho Little Saigon,\" just on the other side of 215 from this venue.   Saturday night around 7pm, this space was packed. I snagged the last table. Based on the ravings of other Yelpers, I ordered without consulting the menu: egg rolls app & a small chicken pho. Amazingly, my entire dinner - the egg rolls presented with romaine lettuce, the pho, a plate of bamboo shoots, everything - was on my table in just under five minutes.   The egg rolls were mid-sized and pretty good, even though they came in at about $6.50 for a plate of four. I usually do spring rolls, here they are a plate of two large for about $5.50.  This was pretty good pho. For a small, the portion was very generous, both the chicken and the noodles. The white meat chicken was OK but not especially flavorful. To be expected: to be served so fast, the broth already-done must just catch the chicken dropped-in. Some salt & pepper would have helped the chicken itself, but there was none on the table (there was rooster sauce, tho.) The broth was pretty tasty, not off the charts, but good. Next time, I will try a beef pho to test what should be a more savory broth.   The initial service, as I said, was fast. After that, my table was pretty much forgotten. I caught a beverage refill as one wait made a pass. Other than that, I never saw anyone again, though I wanted for more napkins. I noted another table that also had to flag down staff for their needs.  With tax, before beverage and tip, this meal was $16.56 out-the-door. And I was still hungry.   Next time, I'll go with the large pho - and skip the pricey appetizer. I didn't notice any lunch specials being pushed ... but I bet there are. I'll try for that and see what gives.",

Everybody in the group are meat/seafood eaters and I'm the only vegan so we chose this place because of that.  #29 is he vegetable Pho and tell them that you want vegan so they can use a vegetable broth. The bowl comes out loaded with veggies and tofu and with all the additional toppings they provide you to adjust to your liking, its delicious! I ordered the large and ate the entire bowl and they have tofu spring rolls (I think #3). Service was quick and friendly and we'll definitely return.  #29 vegan Pho #3 vegan spring rolls Great quick service",

    "text": "Overall: Pho Saigon 8 disappoints in making its namesake dish, but the Hu Tieu was pretty dang good. It might be my regular for that dish, but I'll have to continue looking for a pho restaurant.  Food: 3  Pho Chin (Cooked Brisket): The broth lacked the intense umaminess from beef bones, but it was clear and not too sweet. However, the brisket was completely dry and tasteless.  Hu Tieu My Tho Kho: Surprisingly, this dish was good. The sauce was well balanced and flavorful. There was plenty of sauteed ground pork and offals, and the shrimps were a good size. They aren't too consistent on the offals as one bowl had almost all heart while the other had a mix of heart and liver. Make sure to ask for the hu tieu giay!  Service: 3  We didn't have too many interactions with the waiters outside of ordering and asking for a few extra things.  As a California native from Little Saigon, I'm used to ordering in Vietnamese in Vietnamese restaurants. However, I'm not sure if all the waiters here speak Vietnamese fluently because our waiter seemed to have a hard time understanding my order.  Ambiance: 4  Pho Saigon 8 is a small restaurant, so the tables are kind of close together. But it's decently clean and cool.",

There is one lady who does get customer service and does a good job taking care of customers, but she is not always there.

As the day draws to a close, the broth resembles water and salt thrown in a bowl with oil.  But as the others said, service is in the pits.  Once we were seated and they completely forgot to take our order for like 15 minutes-then we left.  Be sure to order two drinks and water for yourself, because once they throw you food  on your table they'll never check up on you.     Also the tables are cramped so close together so if you and the person scoot your seats together, you'd practically be siamese twins.",

It's a small restaurant with tight seating, a bit uncomfortable. The soup isn't usually hot enough to my liking, but temp is good for the kids. I hate the fact that they never bring you an itemize check, so you have to trust them. Mmmm...I don't think so! The floor is a bit slippery so don't wear your cute heels you might eat it. Also they don't have fountain soda, only cans (just saying). All in all decent restaurant, close to home, fast unfriendly service, tight seating (you might even make a new friend, not by choice), food is consistant, don't order soda (can) or drink the water (gross), have them give you and itemize check or repeat back your order when paying, if the soup isn't hot enough send it back, and wear shoes with grips so you won't fall on your ass.

    "text": "Let it be said that there is absolutely nothing horrible about this place.  Everything is just mediocre.    First, the decor was the best thing about it.  It was new, well-painted, pretty paintings and new chairs and tables with granite on top.  There were nice fake plants on the ceilings and walls, and the bathroom was clean, and nice.  The problem is that the tables had this bar under them where my friend kept hitting his knees against.  The tables were set so close together that I could probably have reached over to the other table and stolen a spring roll off of it.  Speaking of the spring rolls, they were just not good.  The flour sheets on the spring rolls were chewy, and they did not have that nice crunchy stuff in the center that tastes really good, like the ones at Lemongrass.  The dipping sauce was good, but not exceptional.  The pho was the biggest let-down today.  Pho Saigon 8 on Spring Mountain had rich, full broth, that seemed just a little too fatty, and was very good.  This one was rather thin, and its flavor was easily masked by any of the things that you could put in it.  For example, more basil meant that the pho tasted like basil and not pho.  Add bean sprouts, and the pho tasted like water and not much else.  The meat was good, though, and they put a liberal amount of green onion, which I always like.  I also tried the lemon soda.  This was a very good soda, although it was much too sweet.  I think it could have benefited from having more lemon flavor and less sugar in it.    They have no sandwiches.    In addition, everything there is smaller, and/or more expensive than Lemongrass, right across the street.  For example, the large pho was the same price for both, but the bowl is smaller was easily finished by myself and my friend.  We've almost never finished a large pho at Lemongrass.  The Vietnamese seafood crepe was both smaller *and* more expensive, by as much as $0.50-$1.00, and while good, made me a little skittish about ordering it again.  The Spring Rolls were the same price, but came with only two instead of three like at Lemongrass.    Much as I want to see more pho places around, I simply cannot recommend this place with Lemongrass Cafe so close to it.  Maybe if it was in the middle of rural Nevada with no other competition, it would have impressed me more.  I'm sorry, Pho Saigon 8 :/",

Although I prefer the West side one on Spring Mountain because it allows a bit easier access with my wheelchair, I am glad that they are now present on the Eastside. A previous Yelper commented that the Lemongrass Cafe across the street is much better, but I have to disagree. Furthmore, the danky carpet in the other place ruins my appetite. Saigon 8 creates the best both for the phos everytime. According to a lot of my Vietnamese friends, it is created fresh every day. The summer rolls are always delicious and their peanut sauce is superb. When I need comfort food this is the place to be. I even feel guilty if I do not order my usual dishes.",

I liked the fact that they had chopsticks and spoons in a little fancy dispenser on each table, along with the sauces. The waiter didn't really check on us, and we waited a few minutes to get the bill and a takeaway box, even with the usual \"turning around to find someone to help us\" look.

    "text": "It was 8:30 p.m. on a cool Thursday evening. My daughter and I had just been in the neighborhood and thought about eating Pho. We had seen this restaurant many times as we drove by but never stopped in. I wish we never had. We walked in and there was no one in the establishment. One of the employees were cleaning the floors and chairs were pulled out from the tables. We asked if they were open and the owner waved us in and we sat. (They close at 10:00p.m.)The two flat screen tvs were off and it was very quiet....really quiet. We ordered a large pho tai and salt and pepper shrimp to share. The soup broth was not the best and you could see alot of oil floating on top and not to mention hardly any noodles. We were thirsty from the saltiness and needed a refill on water but all the employees and the owner were sitting down eating dinner. I had to get up and ask for service. Three other tables came in and were seated at 8:45pm. Once their food was delivered the employees once again sat at \"their\" table and continued eating. I had to stand up once again to ask for the check. I'm sorry I had not gone to Lemongrass Cafe to eat in the first place. We will never go back to this establishment. One more thing. As one of the employees brought our dish of the shrimp, he asked if we wanted rice (which comes with this order). We said yes and as he walked bakc to the kitchen, sneezed a very large, loud, yucky sneeze, we almost didn't want the rice!!!!! Gross!",

I am mostly restaurant vegetarian and it's hard to find pho that is not either a beef or chicken broth.  Their's (I think called tofu/vegetable) is very flavorful, salty, and comes with a platter of very fresh veggies to arrange in your soup as you like.  My husband and I each get a large bowl- it is huge and takes forever to eat!  Their fresh spring rolls (the cold ones) are good, but not the best i've had.  The sweet sauce that comes with them is great.  Major bonus points for a place that offers a veg pho on par with the traditional beef one!",

They see that we have a toddler and automatically come out w/ our waters & of course a styrofoam cup w/ a lid on it w/o even having to ask them for it.   Typically we like to share our pho w/ my son rather than ordering him his own bowl. So we'll ask for an extra bowl and along w/ the extra bowl we asked for, they bring out scissors (to cut the noodles and the meat) and plastic silverware. I love the fact that they knew and we didn't have to ask for every single thing. Never disappointed and their food is delicious!!  Our usual order is, #1 crispy fried egg roll #20, noodle with rare eye round, flank & beef ball",

    "text": "I've been to Pho Saigon 8 multiple times; there are a few pros and cons for me.  Pros: - Generous portions of Pho for low prices - Delicious, hearty broth; one of the better broths out of the Pho restaurants I've been to - Delicious Vietnamese fried egg rolls and rice paper spring rolls - Fast service   Cons: - Brisket is the only meat I ever order in my Pho and the brisket here is way too fatty. Each slice of brisket is over 50% fat. There's different kinds of fatty too but this one is ridiculously chewy. I spend more time dissecting my brisket than enjoying my soup.  - Sometimes the bean sprouts they bring out for your Pho looks and tastes old and withered  Anyway, the broth is amazing. If you order your pho and get meatballs, flank steak, rare beef, etc. I would definitely recommend coming here. If you like brisket though, try Pho Little Siagon across the street. Such tender beef brisket!",

Admittedly they only get 4 stars because sometimes I've called in an order, they tell me it will be ten minutes and by the time I get there, my order is not ready nor does anyone seem to recall me having put one in. I go at least 3 times a month if I can. The males seem to do this more then the females working there. It has happened more then once and it does get annoying after awhile. It is also a hit or miss sometimes with the soup itself. There have been times I have gotten meat that appears a little off putting and I get sick after eating it. It's rare but it does happen.  Overall I enjoy coming here, as I can just pick up my soup after I get off work and go. Admittedly I wish they stayed open until 11 instead of ten like their spring mountain locations but otherwise no other complaints.",

    "text": "THIS IS THE BEST PLACE FOR PHO IN LAS VEGAS. Don't be fooled, they have another location on Spring Mtn Road in Chinatown, but this location in Henderson is much better.  For me pho comes down to 4 things.  1. the soup.  2. the noodles 3. the meat 4. cleanliness  The soup here is real, some places try to cut corners by not using real stock, they go with the \"gaijing\" or chicken/pork base, this saves hours of prep and time (and is cheaper) but the taste isn't there. If you want to know if real stock is being used, take a cup full home, put it in the fridge and if it has fat settled on the top in form of white dots, its the real deal. THIS PLACE USES REAL STOCK AND THE FLAVOR IS REALLY REALLY GOOD.  The noodles here are good, they don't give you a ton, so if you are a big eater like myself you can order extra, or load up on the sprouts and basil. I am 6'4 and push 300 lbs, this place fills me up with out extra noodles, mainly due to the generous portion of meat.  The meat here is perfect. IT IS CUT THIN!!! There are so many pho places that simply slice their meat too thick and it tastes chalky and hard to digest. Here they do it perfect. The rare eye of the round, brisket and fatty brisket are perfect. I get the #18 that comes with all the above with tendon and tripe.  You can tell this place is well taken care of. The hoisin sauce bottle is clean, the hot sauce container doesnt have 3 week old hot sauce jerky hanging from it (foodies will know what i mean) and the place is decorated nicely, service is fast and nice.  We live 2 mins from Chinatown but will travel 30 mins to Henderson to eat here. BEST PLACE FOR PHO IN LAS VEGAS, HANDS DOWN.",

Told her I wanted Pho Xao Don Thap Cam which I've had at different Vietnamese restaurant. She pointed at #79-Pho Ap Chao Thap Cam. I asked specifically if noodles are flat and cut in squares. She mutters, \"It's same..same thing\". Okay I'll get it. 10minutes later guy comes and drops it off at table and leaves. I waved at guy to tell him it's not the same noodles that I wanted. He said, u ordered #79! Yes but only bc she said it was same thing....And it's not! He then tried to explain that every place makes it different. Okay I understand that so don't tell me it's same thing if it's NOT, right? Well immediately I said, \"can I see the menu I want something else.\"!He continues trying to explain and wasn't taking it off my bill bc \"I ordered it\". I finally said fine do whatever charge me but I don't want it.  I ordered #70. It was okay(5.5/10), definitely had better at other places.  Now that I've read few other 1star reviews on here, 200% I will NOT ever eat here!!! It was on dirty dining for demerits, Yelper witnessed employees not washing hands, Yelper had hair and bug found in their food! Plus you raised the prices on menu I noticed.   Here's my $13.75 of advertising for u!!!",

The prices are pretty fair for the amount of food you get--you'll be pretty full from just one bowl of soup. I love the traditional leaves and beansprouts that they serve alongside the pho. I always douse mine in hot sauce as well. When I've got a really bad cold, there's nothing I crave more than a steaming hot bowl of spicy, salty, hydrating pho. However, I've been elsewhere in clark county and must say that this is far from the best pho in town.

Like all Vietnamese places, the service is fast and the waiters don't speak English. So, you can always order by the numbers next to the food item. Even though it's not the best pho I've had, I still come here regularly because of its location and good quality. Oh yeah, their fried rice is actually good too, give it a shot!",

    "text": "Easily Pho-gotten Experience  Can't really comment on the sister restaurant in Spring Mountain, but I stopped by here since I currently reside on the east part of town and I wanted to check out the Las Vegas Athletic Club located not far behind.  A good way to judge a Vietnamese restaurant is the quality of the their beef pho broth.  While I was fairly hungry having scheduled a late lunch, I was both delighted and simultaneously skeptical regarding the fact that my steaming bowl of beef pho with flank steak and tendon came within 2 minutes of placing my order.  One of my Vietnamese friends taught me some easy signs to spot a good broth are through sight and smell prior to tasting.  One should detect an immediate aroma upon the bowl being placed at your table and I'm not sure if that was the case.  The clarity of the broth both in term of being able to visualize the ingredients and the absence of an abundance of oil at the surface also is a positive sign and this broth appeared to pass the sight test.   Poking my chopsticks around followed by adding the standard sides (sprouts, jalapenos, lime, and basil), I began to slurp and taste.  The noodles were the right texture and not overly clumped together, although this can be the most forgivable fault if all else is right.  The meat was problematic in that the thin slices were clumped together like miniature meat softballs and the only way of preventing any undercooked areas would be to OVERCOOK the whole mass.  Anthony Bourdain once commented in his book Kitchen Confidential that one should never order steak well done since you will likely get the worst cut of meat available since one cannot tell the difference between the best and worst when it is well done.  I feel the same holds True when you are trying to assess the quality of the thinly sliced beef in one's pho.  The tendon was actually the star in that they were sliced with a good combination of collagenous goodness and the occasional hint of meat and cooked to perfection.    Last but not least, the broth is what makes or breaks the dish, and in this case, my nose trumped my eyes in that the taste of the broth was fairly one-dimensional.   The broth is usually a matter of pride amongst Vietnamese moms and no two are alike since hours to days are spent perfecting the signature combination of beef bones, ginger, onion, and aromatics (cinnamon, anise. cloves, peppercorns, etc) guarded in households much like the Colonel Sanders' original recipe.  I could barely detect anything beyond a mild sweetness which could have been MSG or a bouillion cube (we'll see how thirsty I am a few hours from writing this review).  I am probably being overcritical since I have had some great broths in the past, so I will say that much like the clientele which was mostly of mixed caucasian/asian couples, this place would be a great primer for someone new to pho since I would think perhaps the addition of the other subtle flavors may weird out the newcomers and sometimes one has to sample an average broth to appreciate an excellent broth.    P.S.  Probably the only pet peeve of mine is avoid taking home noodle soups unless you plan on consuming them later that night.  It is a food crime to eat them as leftovers when the noodles have had a chance to get soggy and release their starches and muddle the broth.",

    "text": "I just got back from a two week trip to Vietnam and was excited to test out Pho Saigon 8 after reading some good reviews from John Curtis.    First, I noticed that some have complained about the service.  It's not prompt, or attentive, but trust me, that's authentic!  In Vietnam servers don't get tipped so they have no reason to be attentive, and there you have to ask for your check... So, if it really is Vietnamese staff working there, expect to have to request your check and realize that it's not rude to approach them.  Now for the food!  We ordered vegetarian spring rolls which were tasty, although they could have used some more herby additions.  The dipping sauce was delicious!  We split the Pho Tai (thin strips of beef in the beef pho broth).  The pho was good, not the best I've had, but a solid middle of the road.  It was pretty flavorful, add-ins are appropriate (giant basil, bean sprouts, hot peppers).  But, what impressed me was that they had the rice crepes that have become my favorite Vietnamese meal!  The crepe is made with rice flour (it's a savory crepe, folks), cooked in a pan until a bit crispy, and filled with bean sprouts, shrimp, and pork.  It comes with a fish sauce based dripping sauce that augments this dish wonderfully.  With this meal (which appears in the appetizer section, but I use as a main course) comes a giant plate of ruffage.  The proper execution is to take a lettuce leaf, cut off a chunk of the crepe + filling, and use the lettuce leaf as a wrap to make your own little spring roll out of it.  Add in the carrot, some kind of other root vegetable, and mint that they provide.  The rolls are cool and crunchy on the outside, warm, crunchy, and flavorful on the inside.  Don't forget the dipping sauce, it's well worth it.  Most Vietnamese restaurants in town don't extend past pho and some stir-fried rice dishes, and maybe a \"clay pot\" type dish if you're lucky.  This rice \"crepe\" will keep me coming back for more, yum!",

    "text": "I've eaten here like 3 times already since i've moved from California. Living in cities like SD, LA, and the SF Bay Area where I would constantly find myself eating at Pho spots over a million times, I was a bit scared to see what Vegas would provide for my Pho cravings.  So far I've stumbled upon this place and the Pho is ok. The broth has the usual flavor, but I think I've had more flavorful broths eating in spots like Pho Ca Dao in San Diego and Jasmin Garden in San Francisco. But I will say the large bowl of Pho can hit the spot when you have the craving.  I have also had their wonton egg noodle soup. Pretty basic. Noodles have a soft texture and the wontons break a part easily--making it a pleasant experience eating together. I'm sad they didn't have the spicy chili oil sauce they have in some Vietnamese/Chinese spots.  Their fresh spring rolls are good as well.  In a way, I think their food is a tad bit over priced compared to some mom and pop Vietnamese restaurants I love going to in California, but ehh i'll get over it.   Another thing is that they have a limit of $10 when using credit cards. Since sometimes I usual eat by myself for dinner, it's kind of annoying.  So overall, the place is just OK in my book.",

Here's what happened.  My good friend paid for the lunch with his credit card.  This was the only transaction for the day on that specific card.  That evening he went to use it for dinner and the card was already shut down.  Come to find out, there were 4 transactions totaling about $800 originating from North Las Vegas while this restaurant is in Henderson (can't be at two places at the same time).  Praise the Lord that the credit card company caught the red flag and canceled his card and the investigation is pending.  I'm so bummed that this happened.  The food is great, the price is not bad and my wife and I were beginning to love  this place!  But in all seriousness and gravity, the good food is not worth the risk of having your identity and credit card stolen.  Be warned and be wise.  I care about all of you, who are reading this, and wouldn't want you to experience such a crime against you.  I implore you to stay away!  Have fun on your quest for good eats! Sincerely, Eric F.  p.s the Sunrise Cafe is great... it's on the north side of the same plaza a couple doors down from starbucks.",

Vietnamese places aren't renowned for stellar customer service, guys - it's nothing personal.  =P  They recently raised the prices so don't use the online menu if placing a to-go order... Grab one inside on the counter.  That's what I did.  Their Thai tea is pretty darn good, surprisingly.  Sadly, no sauces included with noodle bowls... that's why I keep sriracha and hoisin at home.  #71 with a fried egg = nomz.",

The person that cleaned it didn't do such a hot job and never stocked the soup spoons or chopsticks. When we were seated the waitress came and took our order and within 5 minutes we had our pho. The pho was delicious, I can't complain about that but the service was awful. No one came to check on us throughout our meal, no one came to fill up our drinks or even give us napkins. We had to wait about 20 minutes to get someone's attention, when the guy came over I asked for two to-go containers and the check, the guy said ok and disappeared. Just to see him helping others and ignoring us....it was an additional 20 minutes until the waitress who helped us in the beginning came back and checked on us!!! Seriously!? She asked if we wanted water and if we were okay, an hour after she took our order...it's not a big place, it was a normal busy but come on! It's sad cause the food was good but customer service goes a long way.",

I usually get chicken pho or the rare flank steak pho - it's kind of fun to get your bowl of pho full of rare beef and watch it finish cooking in the steaming broth.  I find the broth quite flavorful, but I also like to add squirts of lime, splash of rooster sauce, and sprigs of mint to kick it up a bit.  Even a \"small\" bowl will be plenty for you.  Noodles are plentiful and perfectly cooked.  Service can be a bit sparse, but it's gotten better.  Also, the pho gets to your table FAST - so there's not a lot of coming and going to interrupt your dinner conversation, reading, etc.  Pleasant little dining room.",

    "text": "First off let me say that I rarely write one star reviews (check my other reviews on different restaurants) but I had to write this because of the HORRIBlE service that we received today! We ordered on the phone and they don't repeat your order back to you but when they get your order wrong, they claim that it's your fault. I am honestly not a difficult customer by any means but this place lacks any sort of customer service. We placed a simple order on the phone and repeated it to the lady multiple times.   When my bf arrived to pick up the order, the order was wrong. Instead of 59 it was 69 that they gave. The lady said, \"this is what you got, what do you want? An add on?\" And he was trying to explain that the order was wrong. They started raising their voices at him basically blaming him for their mistake. So they get him the correct order and the order looked half of what is normally served. They clearly were annoyed and didn't care. They're lucky that he already paid and tipped before noticing the error because they did not deserve the tip.   I completely understand that mistakes can happen but blaming the customer and raising their voices because THEY misunderstood is terrible business ethic. If they simply acknowledged their mistake and corrected it appropriately then all would be fine. This is not how to run a restaurant or any business for that matter. What a shame because I have family, friends, and co-workers that love pho but I would not recommend coming here to any of my friends and family any longer due to the terrible service. I'd recommend going to a different pho place, there's a ton in Vegas anyway.",

Both hubby and BIL ordered the Bun Bo Hue Large and I ordered the small.  The bowls came out quickly and as they were finishing up their bowl, I finished almost 1/4 when I noticed a bug that looks similar to a rollie pollie in my bowl of soup.  I spooned it out, waved down our waiter, and at first glance, he said, \"it's good..\"  I said, \"that's a bug in my soup.\"  He took the spoon with the bug and brought it back to the kitchen.  Moments later, another waitress that spoke fluent English came out to apologize and ask if i want anything else.  At that point, I am disgusted already so I said no and check please.    They took off the small bowl of Bun Bo Hue off of the check, but still charged for the bowls of the same soup that hubby and BIL ate.  We came to the conclusion that the bug must have been in the big pot of soup that they served to all customers as how else will the bug appear in the soup.  But nope, if they continued to charge us for the two bowls, we are sure they continued to serve that to other customers.    Very disappointed and will not return.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times before (years ago), and it was always good food and good service.   Most recently, I had dinner here a few nights ago. We got here around 6 or 7pm on a Monday, there was no wait, it was fairly busy, got seated immediately. But a few minutes after that, the dinner crowd started to roll in. We got there in good timing.   Interior still looks the same since I was last here. Nice, clean, asian decor.   I am currently on a Slow Carb Diet (protein, veggies, legumes...at least 20 grams of protein at each meal) to sugar detox and reclaim my health. That day I felt sick, so this was the perfect place to go to that night. My usual yelp habit is to look through the tips and then the reviews. I'm so glad I scanned the reviews because I read Mel C.'s review mentioning Pho with Chicken Breast! Thanks Mel! I scanned the menu at the table as well, and that was the best option for me. I've been to a couple of other Pho restaurants and that's the first time I saw Pho with Chicken Breast on the menu! I was excited.   There's a choice of a small or large bowl, I got the small. The small was a pretty good size, filled with more than enough noodles, broth and thick slices of chicken breast. There must have been 8-10 slices of chicken breast, which was more than I expected. Score! I can't imagine what the large would be.   I usually enjoy the noodles, but this time around because I was sick and have been cutting carbs my stomach didn't do well with the noodles. I ate a few, but they were too much for me. The noodles were pretty thick as well.  Next time, I'll have to ask for no noodles and replace them with veggies.   Oh by the way, you can also ask for egg noodles if you prefer. They had no problem switching to egg noodles with my friend's bowl.   Service was quick! Our food was brought to us in about 5 minutes.   Great service, no complaints and I will be back again!",

My grandma was impressed with how clear the broth was (listen to the old asian lady, they know what they are talking about when it comes to pho!). I liked how it was not too salty but still flavorful.  I got the Bo Luc Lac Rice (shaken beef). The beef was tender and they did not drown it in sauce like some places do. The lady  recommended steamed rice but I opted for their red rice (i think it's tomatoes that makes it red...but I am not sure). Next time, I will do the steamed rice.   Thai tea was amazing! Some places, the thai tea is too sweet. I can still taste the tea at this place.   Service was nice. I liked that they refilled my water so much. Great selection of food. Will be back.",

    "text": "I'm so irritated by this place. I was told about it by family and thought I would give it a try. I was sat promptly for just myself. I totally understand at these places especially for a party of one if your at a large table other party's are sat with you. The family that was sat at the same table had a young child with the loudest Ipad ever on. After five minutes and no servers coming by I got up and decided to order to go.  I ordered a chicken pho, egg rolls, a roll of French bread and Thai iced tea. When he told me the total I almost said never mind but I'm really hungry and craving soup. Fine f*** it I'll pay the !!!!!$21 dollar!!!!! bill. I've never paid so much for literally the same meal I get every time I go to a pho place. That's how much it usually costs for two meals!   So I sit down to wait....and wait......and wait. It's been 30 minutes from the time I ordered to go. I'm about ready to say never mind I want my money back. Me and another guy get up and are looking at the dude in the front like ughhhhh hello! He goes into the back and brings out 5 to go orders! Are you freaking kidding me?!?! So my order was just sitting back there?! When I ask for my Thai iced tea he grabs it out of the fridge with a bunch of melted ice in it. So that was probably sitting there for 30 minutes also. I got it home and it was just warm not hot like it should be. Egg rolls were soggy. Not crispy crunchy. So disappointed   Food was just ok. Not any better than any other place. Not terrible. Just whatever.   Also it was totally silent in there. Like no music. It was awkward no ambiance or vibe.   NEVER GOING HERE AGIAN. I should have just gone to a place I had been before.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch the other day since I was on this side of town. I came with a bunch of friends and we got seated immediately.   I ordered a small pho with brisket & beef balls. My friends got a large pho (#18) & egg rolls. We got our rolls first and without really looking at the menu we assumed that spring rolls were the fried rolls, since a lot of Vietnamese places call spring rolls egg rolls & the uncooked rolls summer rolls. But I guess every Vietnamese place differs? (Kinda confusing tho :( ) we told them that we wanted the fried ones so they had to go back & make our order. At first they told us to just take it & eat them since we ordered it but why take something we won't eat right? The pho on the other hand was good. It had a lot of green onions which I personally like & the broth was flavorful. But my friends & I felt like the only difference with the large was more soup and a bit more meat. They didn't have a lot of noodles to accommodate the meat and I usually like that. My pho had a lot of noodles but not enough meat. I had about 4 beef balls cut in half (2 full size beef balls) & 4 pieces of brisket. I was left with a lot of noodles leftover. Pho 8/10 The egg rolls was good tho! 10/10  Customer service was decent. I feel like at a lot of Asian places customer service is just whatever. Not the friendliest but also not the meanest. A guy always came to refilled our water so +1 for them!   Overall, will come back here again to eat their pho! Especially because of th broth & how fast it was to receive your order.",

I got the combo with tendon, flank, eye of round, etc. What I love about their pho is that they aren't afraid to give you fat. A little fat on the meats is a wonderful thing, especially since the broth is so light.  Restaurant very clean and tidy.",

You raised your prices from 5.75 for a bowl of pho to now almost 9 dollars... and you still don't have enough to buy noodles and veggies?  This is the cheapest spring roll I have ever eaten!  There are maybe 5 strings of rice noodles in it, and nothing except chopped lettuce.... no other meat except shrimp that has been half cut.  I'm sorry but I have been a regular customer for several years and have seen it get worse and worse...  you have lost a customer.  Everyone,  don't expect quality anymore from this place.  Smh.... I am disappointed... and sad at the same time that quality of food has gone down the drain.....",

    "text": "Pho Saigon 8 is alright. It's not bad but not amazing. It's right there dab in the middle It's like your usual pho place. It's located near 215 and S. Eastern near LVAC. Of the 3 or 4 other pho places in the area it's maybe my #2 or 3.  It shares the parking with a few businesses and it gets pretty busy during lunch so sometimes there aren't any parking right in front and you might have to park farther. Also getting in and out might take long.  When I come here I usually get the pho with everything except the meatballs and tripe, just not a fan of it. I think it's the #21 on the menu rare eye round steak, flank, brisket, soft tendon, skirt flank. All of that with the various veggie ingredients and sauces makes a good meal very tasty.  Services is usually good. It's cluttered near the entrance. Seat a good numbers of people. There's a sign that says $10 minimum for credit charges but noticed that they aren't always strict about that policy.   I don't always like eating here cause sometimes it doesn't feel so clean.",

I had the #1 egg rolls, and the lettuce and herbs were fresh cold and crunchy, while the egg roll was hot and crispy, wrapping the egg roll in lettuce and herbs and dipping in the sweet fish sauce provided a wide variety of delicious flavors and textures.  I also had the # 24 beef Pho that had a great beef broth, a generous serving of noodles, and was unusually hearty for a serving of Pho, though I did get the large.  My companion had the #76 which was a combo of many different things in the Pho, she has had more Pho from many more places and she said it was great.  The service was a little below average, come for the food, not for the service.  That's why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars.  I had to ask for a refill of my water multiple times.",

    "text": "When my parents first moved to Las Vegas, they asked the cashier at our pizza place (shout out to Eighth Avenue Pizza in Southern Highlands) where he goes for pho. He was Vietnamese and they assumed he would know where to go. He recommended this joint and that was 5 years ago. This has become one of our favorite places to eat out. Get past the language barrier. The menu (as I have photographed) has plenty of pictures with good descriptions of the food. We pretty much get the same thing everytime: 2 orders of spring rolls (they come 2/order); large pho #18, which has everything- rare eye of round, flank, brisket, tendon, & tripe; and #78, crispy egg noodles with stir-fried chicken, seafood. quail eggs, and vegetables. Sometimes, I order #61, grilled slice beef with rice vermicelli. The food comes out quick and is delicious. The wait staff is hit or miss, which is why I docked them a star. The prices are reasonable- pretty much everything is less than $10. The portions are large. We always end up bringing home our lunch and have it for dinner, too. For $1.85, you can order an extra portion of soup broth to add to the leftover pho. We always enjoy our lunch here. We go early, around 11, because they do get busy closer to noon.",

Should've seen that coming on a cloudy/rainy day. Pho just seems to go so well on cloudy days, doesn't it?  I had the pho and damn I have to give it to them for their consistency. The flavor hasn't changed in years so you always know what you're getting. Your expectations will always be met. I didn't like the fact that the noodles were still pretty hard and had to sit in the broth for it to soften but it's not the end of the world.  The egg rolls are good and the peanut sauce is actually better than other places I've had it at. The service has gotten much, much better over the years. This is probably my pho spot on this side of town.",

We placed our order with him and he didn't even repeat what we ordered, in fact, he didn't say one more word to us. When we got our pho, all our orders were wrong. We asked for extra beef balls in our pho and none of them had it. We also ordered shrimp fried rice with no vegetables and, it had vegetables. I called the waiter over and told him that our order was wrong. He yells out in another language to the girl behind the register, and she walks over. She asks if she could help us. I tell her that we ordered extra beef balls in our pho, and there weren't any. Also our fried rice had veggies, and we told the waiter, no veggies. She then asks if we wanted them to remake it. My Mom tells me in our language to just leave it, they might spit in the food. The bad service made us lose our appetites, and we barely ate our food, which was mediocre.",

My husband always gets just the reg pho tai which is just thinly sliced beef in a clear bone broth.  The give ample veggies (like bean sprouts, mint, basil and jalapenos) to add to your soup. So here's the big secret about Vietnamese soup....best hangover cure ever!!!!

    "text": "I give this place a 5 star for its food!! Its service is a 3.5 on average lol  We first came to this spot since it was so close to home. It really kick started our pho love. We have tried other places and have now decided this is our spot!!! The broth is amazingly flavored. They give generous portions so if your not a big eater the small would fill you up.   Our meals consist of #13 beef broth with raw rib eye and flank, with a side of broccoli... Get it raw the broth is so hot that it will cook thw rib eye to perfection. #18 raw rib eye, flank, tendon, and tripe. We also start with #1 crispy egg rolls that come with generous lettuce and mint. Overall this place has the best Pho in Henderson!! No joke!   The service is spotty. However, we are willing to deal with it for the quality and freshness of the food. It is best to order everything you need before your server leaves to enter your order. Also, if you need a refill on your drink move your cup in eyes view they are ninjas when it comes to refills. We have never had a server be rude they are just usually pretty busy and they are there to get things done. It is very clean and it is not a place to lounge.   If you live in henderson and you are in need of some dank Pho this is a must try!!!",

I'm from Orange County where there is some of the best pho restaurants you can find, so my standards were pretty high when I went on this search. Trust me when I say the best is here.   The wait staff is friendly and the food comes out super duper quick. They are always pretty busy but I have never had to wait for a table to be available.   The only fall back is that you are going be in close proximity to those around you, whether it be at your table or the table next to you. The tables feel kind of small and you have to be mindful when maneuvering around so you don't knock into other people... but this is a small price to pay! And speaking of price, the dishes are very affordable :)",

    "text": "I'm pretty obsessed with the Pho (beef) here. Thai tea is brewed near perfect and the Boba is always an added bonus.   The broth was clear,  and has a great flavor. I ALWAYS take a few spoons of broth and sip it before adding anything. I even have my kids doing it. You have to be able to taste it for what it is. If the broth can stand the taste test alone, then you known the bowl is worth the cost.  The plate full of basil, bean sprouts, lemon and jalapenos was plentiful, and super fresh.   My first time there, there was three of us. It was near lightening speed from when they took our pho orders to when the kitchen staff came out and delivered it to our tables. Seriously, I don't think even 3 minutes passed. Yay, for fast service!  The wait staff and cashier are bit lacking,  which is unfortunate. I asked the waiter for to-go bowls and waited far too long. Finally had to ask cashier, when son went to pay.  Our second trip,  the food and drink was just as good as the first time.  However, the lightening speed was gone, and actually felt we waited a longer time than normal. I will say it was packed on Sunday, so I understand.  All in all I love the Pho. I'm obsessed. I think about it all the time. If it weren't for Lent, I would be slurping it down right this very moment instead of writing this review.",

The owner refused and say they were not willing to do it either I got pork vermicelli or beef vermicelli. They were not willing to accommodate me!!! When I was willing to pay extra. Horrible customer service and horrible accommodation for people that just want to have a meal and willing to pay extra for food that is not included in the original menu item. I was not trying to get comped or get free food I was trying to pay for what I wanted. It is ridiculous that this is the only place that does not do half beef half pork when all of the pho Vietnamese restaurants do it. Extremely ridiculous. The sever was rude and not welcoming at all. Will not be returning here ever again. Some restaurants need to realize that there is plenty of competition and other places are willing to not only have better food but better customer service. We live in Las Vegas, our industry is service, experience.... learn something from other places!",

That's about $3-4 more than the other pho restaurants in Chinatown and it's much better in Chinatown. Okay, it was in Henderson but make it competitive. The meatball suck. It wasn't even good. 2 balls cut in half for $2.00 more? Wasn't worth the extra. They should have a combination bowl with everything in it. The broth was very good, egg rolls were good, and the spring rolls were good. I won't go back. I'm disappointed because they only had holson sauce, Sarachia sauce and a red chili sauce.",

    "text": "This was my first time trying pho or Vietnamese food but it was delicious. I got pork broth pho with rice noodles and grilled pork and chicken. I think it was #47. I also had their spring rolls, which were amazing.   The only problem, one which makes me hesitant to return, was that I ended up sick the next day. Now, admittedly this could be a coincidence; but I can't recommend 5 stars when I ended up sick for 2 days.",

You have to flag someone down if you want a to go box, extras, a napkin, anything. .. Sometimes I've been ignored. I went recently and the soup was cold, broth not as great as it's been and my meat looked old and had spots??? On it.... There was also something in identifiable in the soup. I always order the same kind so not sure what was up. I'm very disappointed and may just find a better place from now on.",

    "text": "Went here because Lemongrass Cafe was closed for remodeling... that place is our go-to, but my partner and I were really craving pho, so we reluctantly had to settle for another nearby place.  Been here once before, but wasn't much memorable back then. Felt the same way the second time around. We were immediately given menus and water, which was cool. Took a little while for someone to take our order though, but no biggie.  Lots of different meat options for the pho. But felt that the broth itself was almost flavorless. Perhaps because it was a freshly cooked batch and didn't have enough time to steep? Who knows. But the side of herbs of basil, sprouts, lime, and jalapenos were very fresh though.  Spring rolls were also big and plump and a filling appetizer for two people. Just wish it had been cut in half to make it easier to eat.  Service wasn't exactly warm, but adequate. Waters were refilled without having to ask. No one checked in on us at the end though or dropped off a check, so we just paid at the counter. (Not sure what the normal protocol was).   Fills the craving, but just made us miss our usual Lemongrass Cafe.",

I also like the spring rolls with the lettuce and cilantro wrap.  Sevice is a bit lacking, after the food arrives the next time they see you is payment on the check.  Last week went in and notice the prices have gone up across the board.  I guess a business can do that if they are busy all the time.",

The service in the restaurant has never been stellar but tonight the service was the topic of our conversation- we had to stand up to get someone to come to our table for a fork- water was never refilled and when we were ready to leave I wanted a to go box and not one person would come to the table. We just decided to leave. When I went to pay the check it was more $$ than I expected and because English is not that well spoken I asked for the receipt. To my surprise they charged a 15% tip--- for a party of 5!!!! It wouldn't have been questioned if the service was good!!!   Won't be back and I will for sure tell everyone I know!",

I mean that guy is not fit to be a server with the kind of attitude that he has. He's just flat out rude. He even rolled his eyes when we asked for straws and to go container. Who does that? With that being said, it just drives the customers away and think not to come back.. Not good for your business.",

And I know this isn't Joel Robuchon at the MGM, where the bussers scrape your bread crumbs off the table with a special bread crumb brush. But for heaven sakes, you are in the hospitality industry as well! I really don't feel their hospitality here! At least ask me if I would like some water? And even when you do ask me if I want water, it is as if you are angry for me coming into the place and having to actually make you work for your dollar! Or why do I have to flag you down whenever I need something?   As far as food, the spring rolls were decent, but nothing to honestly to rave about. The pho was not memorable, but I have had so much pho, maybe I don't know a good one anymore?  They have no sandwiches also .  The decor is maybe the best thing that they have going for them, and location.  I really dislike their tables though. I am 5'1 and very small, and I still think their tables are small! The problem is that the tables have this poorly placed bar under them where my husband kept pushing my legs.  Each table is so closely placed. I can almost hear every conversation around me. Not much of a place for a first date.   I love pho, but if there is another pho place at least a mile away from this one... I would choose the other, cause this place can really piss me off. They can be just darn rude here.",

I've never done this with pho before, so when I went to pick up my ONE order of #11, pho tai, I was surprised to look like I ordered for an entire family!   I got home, unwrapped my goods.... it was just like I was at the restaurant, in my own home:]. Everything that they would serve you was included: all the leafy goodness (still not sure what all of it is), cilantro and chives, LOTS of noodles, and a generous amount of  RAW thin slices of beef. This was all neatly organized in a generic Styrofoam to-go box.  Hoisin sauce and red pepper sauce were also packed into my belongings. Also, a large Styrofoam cup/bowl(?) of the beef broth. The broth was still piping hot. It cooked my beef slices just as I wanted, instantly. Although I did make the mistake of keeping the lid off, so it cooled down pretty quickly and didn't cook the beef so well for my second portion.   Absolutely delicious.   I prepared it all just how I would want it.. and even came back for seconds. I of course didn't waste all the meat, but I couldn't finish the noodles.   It seems that people really knock the ratings down on this place because of the service... so may I recommend take out?? Try it again yallllll",

    "text": "My wife and I were craving bun and our normal place Pho Mai Lan was closed for the evening. So we decided to go for it and give this place a shot.. Well.... It sure was a mistake! We walked in and they asked us how many. We told them two, and they walked us over to a table set down two glasses of water and walked away. Came back a minute later and set down two menus with our napkins on top, then walked away again. After about 5 minutes they come back over and ask us what we wanted. We hadn't decided just yet and we asked for another minute and the reply was, \"Okay, just yell for me when your ready.\" And then she walked away.  Okay?! By now they've lost any chance at a tip. So after we decided to get #'s 69 and 70 we looked around and they came over took our order and about 10 minutes later our food came out! It looked good! Well!.... It wasn't. It was a HUGE disappointment! The shrimp on both plates were dry like last weeks left overs that they nuked for a minute and tossed in our dish. Our pork was a little on the burn side and had a funk nasty after taste, but it wasn't terrible enough to not eat... And my roll was fairly uncomfortable to eat. We'd have to say the worst part was the fish sauce. That wasn't to great.  So while we ate the atmosphere wasn't very inviting. The wait staff was talking on their phones while they were on speaker so we could hear all of their conversation. It was also not very welcoming when they would look at us hoping we would leave.  All in all everything was terrible except their pricing was pretty fair.",

We also had the vietnames rice noodles with shrimp and pork. For some reason they gave us that to go. So I believe this took away from the experience of how its to be eaten.
