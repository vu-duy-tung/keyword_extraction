All were very pleasing, the Chicken was pretty mild for a \"Spicy\" dish, but was otherwise excellent, and came with nice Jasmine rice.  The atmosphere was good, not too dark or bright, although the table we were seated at was little low in relation to the seats.   The service was good, considering that we came in just before closing, I have no complaints.  Protip: Have some hot sake for a nice appetizer",

I had the chicken teriyaki and I'm still trying to figure out if I was really eating chicken....slimy, limp, and tasteless.  We also ordered a California Roll that wasn't on the menu and while they were okay we were horrified that they charged us $14 for 8 pieces!!!  Bottom line, this place is WAY overpriced and in my opinion a poor excuse for Asian food.   Save your money and taste buds and go somewhere else!!!!  Believe me, you'll be trying to find something to get the bad taste out of your mouth when you leave.",

Prices are far less than many of the similar places in Las Vegas, and larger portions.......as good as Sushi Samba, and beats Japonais hands down. Save room for the desserts - I was with a large group and we ordered one of each. all of them are amazing as is the presentaions.....something you dont see often in an asian joint.  also - the list of signature cocktails are expansive and all of them are a real treat. again, my group all ordered a different one....all were unique and amazing. Mama Sons Kiss a favorite.  going to have our friends bachelorette party there for sure. Impressed with all of the new venues coming to Luxor. T&T rocks, Rice is awesome, Tender is a great steakhouse, and looking forward to the new venue from Public House USA coming soon.  a must in Vegas.",

I am not a huge fan of The Luxor so I was very surprise to see the place was busy.  The atmosphere and design of the place was very nice.  The Cucumber Smash wasyummy, lightand refreshing!  We had a bottle of 2009 Jordan Chardonnay and it was good.  We ordered a Dragon Roll and Freaking Good Roll and both are yummy, especially the Dagon Roll.  The Freakng Good Roll was decent but I tasted cream cheese and I am not a huge fan of that but it was good.  We then ordered Hong Kong Noodles, Beef Tenderloin with Black Pepper Sauce, broccolini and an assortement of desserts.  The Hong Kong Noodle was yummy and would definitely oder it everytime!  The Beef tenderloin was a bit too chewy and would ask for it to be cooked a bit more.  Broccolini was nice and crispy!  The assortment of dessert wasn't that impressive; mochi isn't the mochi I am used to having in other Asian restaurants.  I believe the mochi here the shell is fondant but the interior was good; the tart sorbet was too tart.  I think I would pass on the desserts but everything else I will order again, well except the sushi...not huge on order on ordering sushi from hotel restaurants...that is just my preference, nothing wrong with the sushi there.",

What's with the hip hop and dance tunes cranked up? Not very Zen.  We selected Chinese dishes at $25+ each and received them plopped on a plate with a bowl of rice on side.  How original and creative!  There wasn't enough to share, and we didn't receive extra plates, so we found ourselves forced to plop the rice on top of the entree.  The mediocre food quality topped off the less than memorable experience.  This is Vegas and mediocre just doesn't cut it.  I've honestly had better food, service, and less obnoxious music at any PF Chang's",

My boyfriend and I came to this restaurant for a valentines day dinner, the Luxor had given us a coupon when we checked in for a $20 food or beverage coupon to a few places and this was one of them. After waiting near 25 minutes for a table when there were clearly open tables and nobody on the wait list before us we were sat at the table right next to the fish bar. The smell from the fish bar was so pungent and overpoweringly fishy that we asked to be moved. After being moved and finally getting a nice table we were sat with the drink menu only and it took forever to just get the actual menu. We  ordered our food and it came unexpectedly fast. We had ordered the sesame chicken and I took one bite and could barely get it down. It seemed like it had been sitting out all day. We complained to our waiter and asked for the bill and weren't even comped for the meal!!!! We then went back to our hotel room where I proceeded to throw up for the rest of the night. Worst food ever! Do not eat here unless you want them to ruin Chinese food for you, or want to get ill.",

    "text": "\"Eat rice, drink tea, slurp noodles, stay healthy\".  Maybe.  Accept this about all Asian restaurants on the Strip: 1)  Prices are 2x-3x higher than your local joint. 2)  Portions are smaller but prettier. 3)  Flavors are not authentic. 4)  Specialty drinks are delicious. 5)  Service is excellent.  Straight to it, the food.  It's properly cooked by Western standards.  Veg in stir fries are still crisp and vibrant, deep fried chicken still moist, and scallops tender not rubber balls.  Seasonings and flavors are loosely Asian but are subdued and for the uninitiated.  Don't expect undertones of sweet, fermented fish sauce or umame charged fermented black beans.  The subdued flavors do work better with their creative mixed drinks.  Skip the everyday items or risk leaving upset at the price (miso soup at $9, beef broccoli at $25).  Opt for the extravagant.  The lobster tail in ginger onion soy glaze is good.  Correctly cooked.  The simple earthy soy does enhance the sweetness of the lobster and the ginger adds zest.  The togarashi rubbed seared ahi with a miso lime sauce is very good.  The only serious fault remains the sushi.  Questionable freshness.  The Uni, off color and fishy.  The sweet shrimp, slightly ammoniated and tacky mouth feel.  Creative rolls still miss the mark.  Over sauced, unbalanced flavors, bizarre cooking techniques.  Is the chef so vain he can't try one of the many AYCE joints and see how Vegas style sushi is done?  Face it, asking a Chinese chef to prepare Japanese sushi is the same as asking a Italian pizza cook to make dim sum.  To the credit of management, service problems have been correct.  Everyone is familiar with the menu and can describe dishes.  Bar staff who float ask regular staff before making recommendations.  Standard Asian beers.  Fairly priced introductory sakes.    Want authentic national and regional Asian cuisines, look off the Strip.  Looking for some great cocktails and correctly cooked \"Asian\" inspired food Rice and Company modestly delivers.",

Anytime you want a quick in-and-out meal, you can't worry about aesthetics.   Had a GREAT iced tea, although it was bottled (weak) and picked up a few simple rolls.

Total came to $41 for the rolls and the iced tea. Bleh. Double what it should be. These are similar prices to Mizumi (Wynn.

    "text": "Swanky kind of place which is located inside Luxor. Love their motif. Very classy, dark. Can be romantic. The prices are pretty high. Average sushi/rolls are $20-$30. Average entree is about $35-$40.  I ordered the Chop Chop Bang Bang roll. It's pretty cool and something that I have never seen done before. They actually added POP ROCKS so you will get that popping sensation in every bite. I think it compliments the flavor (blue crab, cucumber, tempura crunch, shrimp, avocado, spicy mayo).   The great thing about my experience at least was our $20 restaurant coupon. Don't let the prices discourage you though. If you want fresh sushi with a different twist, i suggest you check this place out.",

All of it was excellent, so much so we went back again a night or so later.    This was our favorite restaurant in Vegas. Good stuff!",

My wife and I had been there years ago and recall it being good.  Unfortunately my memory did not serve me correctly, or perhaps the quality has gone downhill.  I realize everything in Vegas costs a lot more than usual yet I only wish it was somewhat worth the extra coin.  The potstickers and salt and pepper calamari was nothing special.  My daughter and I were craving the Spider roll so we each ordered it.  It looked decent but the taste was very bland and loaded with cucumber which really made it feel like eating a plain salad with no dressing...and I tried to enhance it with wasabi and soy sauce to no avail.  My wife had the Orange Peel chicken which was no better than getting it for a fraction of the cost at Panda Express.  Even the drinks (One Night in Bangkok and Golden Buddha) were nothing special especially for the price.  Overall a very disappointing experience that had much higher expectations.  Guess I'll play chopsticks on the piano now...",

The waitress named \"Dream\" took forever to give us water and about 10 more minutes to take our order. After asking us what cocktails we wanted and we replied, \"sorry, we don't drink\" she rolled her eyes and walked off. It's cool, it's not like I wanted anything beside water... she never asked if we wanted soda, tea, coffee, etc. Unfortunately for her we usually eat A LOT and would have had a nice tip based on that, but she obviously wrote us off. Everyone else delivered her food (who were actually courteous so that's cool) so we didn't see her after we placed our order until we got the bill. The food tasted like they ordered it from the food court at Excalibur and delivered it to our table. For as much as they were charging I expected way more. We got the shrimp tempura (meh) and orange peel chicken (we couldn't finish it as it was pretty gross.) \"Dream\" handed me the bill and didn't even look at me when she was like, \"ugh, thanks for coming...have a nice night...\" So, she can dream about getting a tip. We went to the food court and finished eating. All in all, this place is terrible.",

This place is the epitome of \"rip 'em off once and who cares if they return.\"   Yes things in Vegas are pricey but this place is just ridiculous for what you get.  $10 for two pieces of salmon sushi?  $9 for a miso soup?  And the food and service is nothing special.  Essentially everything here is almost exactly double the price of what it would be off the strip and 50% higher than what it should for the strip.(example: Salmon Nigiri: $5 off strip, $7.50 on strip, $10 here)  As you can see from most reviewers, they were sucked in with the $20 off.  It makes the place reasonable, IF YOU ARE EATING ALONE! The problem is when people are in Vegas, caution (or common sense) tends to be thrown to the wind - especially while drinking.  This place doesn't have to strive for repeat business because some other sucker will be flying in for vacation the next day.  So these Vegas hotel restaurants can enjoy a constant stream of mostly one-time customers to rip-off with insane prices like this.  The locals must laugh at us.",

I tried the Rice and Co. Dragon Martini which was WONDERFUL! Made with fresh strawberries MMMmmMM. We ordered the calamari which was DELISH. So perfectly cooked and great dipping sauces. We ordered 2 rolls which now I can't remember their names!! But one had eel and cream cheese and another had spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail. Both were very fresh and delicious. We really enjoyed it and seriously spent as much money on the food as we would have at home. For sure a place to check out if you are not on a \"living large\"  Vegas budget but want excellent sushi!",

Is pleasant and tables are separated by an acceptable distance, but there is cigarette smoke that finds its way into the dining area. If somehow the smell of cigarette smoke could be kept out, that would be great. But alas, we're in Vegas...smoking everywhere. Makes the food taste a little subpar...sorry!",

    "text": "We stayed at the Luxor so it was fitting to try this restaurant because there was a $20 coupon in the hotel guest book to use. We got the the restaurant with no reservations and was put onto a 15 min wait list. 25 minutes passed and nothing so we checked with the hostess who said, oh we couldn't find you. Obviously she was making an excuse cause we were right in the side of her all the waiting time and she didn't call our name. The other hostess sat us and she had a 'I'm all that' kind of attitude and faked smiled us to be seated and even apologizing about the wait. Our server, cheerful , observant and helpful. Well needed because the restaurant is so noisy and dark that reading the menu was a chore. The food, okay. Not the greatest but okay yet not bad also. We had the seafood cucumber mango salad to start and the spicy tuna roll and tempura roll. All good dishes but not the greatest. Price, extremely high but discounted from the coupon and the but one get one at half deal on yelp, it made up for the lack of service from the hostess.  Hope you all have a better experience.",

In terms of Chinese food, I come from the SGV so my tastes are spoiled by that fact.  However, even if I weren't spoiled, the food here was still subpar.  I got the mao po tofu and the shu mai.  First off, everyone knows that when you get shu mai at Dim Sum (which this was advertised as) you get 4.  This came with 3.  The color looked very dull like it had been made a while ago and was just being reheated till it was served.  Taste-wise it was average...but presentation was awful.  The mao po was simply bad.  It was, again, advertised to be spicy.  The dish was not spicy at all.  In fact, it was super sweet...like dessert sweet. Really....really...bad  The service was decent...but the food was blah!!!!  Don't waste your time or money.  Go to Panada express, it will be just as good if not better and a fraction of the price",

    "text": "I wanted to start off by saying that my wife and I use Yellowtail at the Bellagio as the standard for dining experience and we also go there when in Vegas.  That said, we are usually on the lookout for a place to go for the 2nd night and have yet to really hit the target.  Rice & Company my be that place for a few reasons that I will detail below.  To start out, we had the M-Life $50 off $100 opportunity that several people have listed below.  My wife found it when we were looking for a place and it was the main reason we decided to try it since we don't spend any time at the Luxor.  It's a wise marketing move for them since it motivated us to try something new.  As for the 5-stars, it 100% starts with the service which was about as good as you can get from a bartender.  Luis was the star of the night.  There area some people in the industry that just \"Get it,\" meaning they know how to drive the pace and feel of the experience.  I don't know what Luis makes but it isn't enough in my opinion when I compare him to other bar staff I have seen over the years in this town.  Fantastic member of the team.  As for the dining experience, we started off with drinks.  My wife ordered the Dragon Martini which she enjoyed and I had Pinot Grigio which was very good and also at their Social Hour price of $6 which can't be beat.  We were well on our way with good drinks in hand.  My wife started with some Edamame and then we got the Seared Ahi Tuna.  I liked the design because I was expecting it to have more of a drizzling of won ton chips over the top with the tuna on the bottom in sauce.  Instead, it resembled a tortilla chip with it placed on top.  Great decision to go that route rather than a cheaper way.    We also ordered the Yellowtail Hamachi, a Rainbow Roll and a special roll called the Candy Cane which was an explosion of fish.  Probably the most fish you could pack into a roll and have it stick together.  They hit it out of the park on that one.  All of the sushi was fresh, chilled perfectly and well put together.    There was absolutely nothing to complain about here.  The whole experience from start to finish was on point and we will return for sure.",

I especially liked the grilled jalapenos garnish. We ordered four rolls of sushi; Sexy Lady, Blue Man Group Drum Roll, Chop Chop Bang Bang( had pop rocks candy on top, made for quite a crunch), and Hot Dang. ALL four of them were amazing! Granted we are not sushi snobs, but we thought these rolls were great! Ended with green tea ice cream that came with a great almandine type crisp.  The service was top notch. Had everything we needed before even to have to ask. And the food timing was perfect.  We both agreed that even without the food credit we would definite eat here again!",

Now they have some agreeable house music. Things look much cleaner. Oh and yeah, Rice & Company.  I had a hard time figuring out what kind of food joint this would be. You can get sushi, Chinese food, Thai food, etc. You had plenty of options.  David, our waiter, was very good. He was able to rattle off the different sections of the menu and little tips about certain dishes. For me, it was unnecessarily complicated. I'm a little apprehensive of places that have many different types of food as it becomes a game to figure out what type of food is cooked well.   We started with sushi. I hate cucumbers and this menu was full of cucumber sushi. However, the cucumber was almost unnoticeable. The sushi was delicious. The right amount of each ingredient.   We also ordered Honey Crisp Chicken. David did do me a solid in letting me know that the honey crisp chicken was a sweet chicken (what you consider Orange Chicken at Panda Express) and their Orange Chicken is a more citrus based taste. The Honey Crisp Chicken sauce had some sweetness but not overpowering. The chicken was dry and had an offputting tang to it.   The lame duck of the three was the Pad Thai. It definitely needed to be spicier. The noodles seemed like the wrong type of noodles or undercooked or something. They were a little tougher and didn't hold any of the Pad Thai goodness very well.  Luckily, the fried banana with ice cream dessert ended the night on a sweet note. Spent a lot of time afterwards just talking. Parking jumps up to $8 if you stay longer than 4 hours.",

In fact we thought it was beef because it was so dark! The service was pretty good, but the server couldn't help but keep reaching between the two of us as me and my friend were talking. The other side of the table was empty which would have been made more sense.   Also, the bathroom is by the Bodies Exhibit, a long walk away. It seems odd that they couldn't put a restroom in such a big and nice restaurant such as Rice & Co.",

The sushi was average, the appetizers were ok, basically for what they appear to be and the prices they charge, it is a place we are glad we tried but will not go back too.  Basically, you can go to RA during happy hour and get more food for a cheaper price and enjoy the experience.  This place was way overpriced for the quality they deliver.  The quantity was ok, but the price did a lot more then they quality and not worth it.  We mainly went here because our daughter wanted sushi and even she was disappointed and has no desire to return.  There is better sushi in a small strip mall near the house then this place.  The only reason this place is getting 3 stars instead of 2 is the service was ok.  They were visible and checked on you but it does not make up for bad food.  Not on the return list ever....",

I wish I had seen that before buying my tickets but I mention it only so you have an option to get a great meal and show for one price.  The food was flavorful and fresh. It was delivered two minutes after we ordered it so they were also freaky fast.  Our server was polite and knowledgeable on the menu and I Truely enjoyed his recommendation. I wont even fault him for stumbling and spilling one of our drinks and not offering to replace it or remove it from our bill. I still tipped well and only took away one star for that.  The other star was for playing pop music in an Asian restaurant. It just ruined the whole Asian ambience they had obviously worked so hard to incorporate into the restaurant.   Its a good place to eat and this Yelper gives it two thumbs up!",

Looked roomy and not too crowded and decided to give it a shot.  Expected to seated right away since it was not too busy, but still had to wait about 15m+ to get a table.  There weren't any seats while we waited, just a ledge to lean against.  The hostess was also not the most inviting person to be making first impressions to customers.  The food we ordered (took a bit to come out) was quite good.  Beef & Broccoli, Mongolian Beef, Chicken Wings and Avocado Rolls.  The pork fried rice was so-so.  4 stars for Food and Waitress. 2 stars for hostess and price  PROS: + Very good/attentive waitress + Food is quite good, better than expected  CONS: - Long wait to get a table when it wasn't packed - Hostess was not the friendliest - Way over priced - Booth seats are very uncomfortable sitting in the end",

The ingredients of the rolls were fresh and crisp, but the rolls were exceedingly greasy. The main course was Cashew Chicken in a light sauce. This was the first Cashew Chicken we've had that wasn't cooked in a brown sauce, which is OK, but the \"light sauce\" was tasteless. The vegetables were fresh and crisp and there were ample amounts of white meat chicken, but overall, the dish was bland. The real disappointment was the fried rice which was waaay overcooked and bordered on mush. Water to drink. Service was excellent. The cost was just under $80 for two. My advice: find another place.",

The soup and chicken was warm which it seemed it just been sitting on their kitchen table for some time.  We had to request to have the food hot.  The seafood noodle soup was only ok and lack flavor. After the chicken wings was brought back it did taste very good and the general tso chicken with rice.  The sushi was sweet instead of spicy which we were surprised at first coz we thought we had the wrong order.  The strawberry and sauce they put made the sushi tasted too sweet instead of spicy.  In addition, this place was pricey. We didn't mind the price if the food tasted good.",

Two of us had scallop sushi as well.    Starting from the beginning, we were told we could sit in the lounge or wait for a seat in the restaurant. We opted for the lounge. Nice, clean, seems good. Order drinks, friends martini takes at least five minutes. Here begins the waiting game...as we order our food and then wait. And wait. And wait.   My noodles came out on a hot plate but lukewarm. Seems like a good sign it was sitting under the heat lamp waiting for a runner for a good ten minutes. Noodles, other than being only somewhat warm, are bland. Some of the toppings were tasty, but overall a mediocre dish, especially considering the price. Same for my friends mapo tofu. Just meh. The scallops were delicious but you can't screw up that, however the nigiri sushi was skimpy on the rice, and the rice was either horribly miscooked or had sat for ages because it was dry and unpleasantly chewy in the center (of the skimpy amount anyways). I've had better at dollar conveyor sushi shops. Much better.   Friends sushi rolls are ok, but honestly whatever crunchy thing they put in the center of a lot of their specialty rolls is really offputting.  Overall was triple the price of our lunch at Lotus of Siam today and at best half the quality. The best part of this meal was going downstairs and buying a chocolate milkshake to help wash away the memory of it in fat and sugar.  (one star for decor and location and one for decent enough service...but for anything food related???  No.)",

Pot stickers were a hit with my 7 year old. My 9 year old has chicken fried rice and thought it was great, but the vegetable fried rice was described as \"tasteless\" by my mother in law.

I am satisfied with the food and service.

The first noodle dish was tasty and had a flavorful curry touch to it. The faint hint of lemongrass was the only thing I could distinguish in their Pad Thai. The mix of mini shrimp and chicken was fair, but it had no citrus or spice to it. Everyone agreed that the salad was the best dish. The beautiful chunks of crab meat, slices of mango and chunks of cucumbers marinaded well in the creamy and tangy dressing. The gorgeous spoonful of red caviar eggs on top was a nice touch and made the dish pop.   The various segregated areas are nice to provide some sense of privacy and intimate conversation once you get over Ke$ha telling you to \"Take It Off\".",

This is definitely one of those places. 4 people with a $40 credit still ends up costing about $60 per person! Sorry, I'd rather have steak, prime rib, lobster, and king crabs anywhere else in Vegas for $20 less.  Now about the food, While not horrible, not great either.  \"Chinese-Thai\" food: Mongolian Beef was tasty, but the portion was very small. Pad Thai, it tasted ok, the noodles weren't quite right and again the portion was very small  Sushi: It was ok, portions were small as well for the price.  We did end up discovering one of the reasons our bill was so high. We ordered miso soup for all 4 ppl. They charged us $9 per miso soup. That's almost $40 for miso soup. It was again just ok, but a bit cold, and no miso soup anywhere should cost $9 a bowl!  Furthermore, I'm pretty sure the waitress knew that and still chose to play the, \"you didn't ask\" card to escape culpability. This is just shady waitress! You know very well nobody would accept $9/miso soup, and you could have informed us when we ordered. You tried to pull a fast one. You did pull a fast one on us.  Shame on you!  I even mentioned it at the end, and you just acted like you didn't hear me. Scam artists!",

We didn't even enjoy our damn ramen cause we lost our appetite waiting so damn long. The bill was about 88 fucking dollars. The ramen didn't even taste like ramen. There was no damn flavor at all. The 99cent ramen packets taste way better than this crap. Also, there was a table in front of us who came after us and they got their food within 15 minutes. What the hell is this crap? I would not suggest this place at all. The food court tastes and has better service than this crappy place.",

Their food is so gross and they charged so much for a dish.  We ordered their garlic chicken and there were barely any chicken in there.  Totally over-priced and so not worth it.  I also ordered their Sake Sangaria... OMG, it was the worst drink ever.  You know what it tasted like?  Pineapple juice.  The best part about the drink is the fruits that they throw in the glass.  That's exactly what I told the waiter.    And their service is just lousy.  I am not sure if they tried to be all fancy.  The hostess takes you to the table and they handed you the drink menu only.  We waited forever for the waiter to bring us the main menu.  Then we waited forever to get silverware  and napkins and we waited forever for the waiter to come back to take our order.    Overall, my take is this.  We don't mind paying $$$ when it comes to food.... IF IT'S WORTH IT.  Horrible experience and horrible over-priced food.  It sure makes me appreciate Panda Express so much more.",

I am such a big fan of asian cuisine that my own family wonders if I am the reincarnation of some awesome samurai/ninja/karate master  (well at least that's how it goes in my head) .  Lets start with the strong points..and the first one is...THE FOOD!  Big portions, not much rice ..man it was perfect. The UNI was out of control awesome.The sashimi pieces were generous as well. And the rolls were good and had just enough rice to satisfy but not overpower the rest of the ingredients.  We also decided to try the duck and Im glad we did. It was delicious! Not dry at all , not too greasy ..just right. We also added the crab and lobster cakes.. Guys if you go there, order those FOR SURE. What an experience on the flavor!  Location is kinda...well..weird.. Its far from both parkings..you are techlincally in the middle between Mandalay and luxor so the walk if you (like me ) park at the main mandalay structure can be a little too long and confusing  For some reason, the rolls and sashimi took a little too long to come out, and when I say a little too long I mean like 45 minutes.. Really takes that long to cut fish?  Our server was great and our busser was incredible. Water level was always above half and both as a team were super friendly.  In conclusion, this is def a very good spot..Can get pricy but not as bad as other places. And if you like uni..give it a try here.",

Our party of four got a variety of food during our most recent visit, and opinions were positive. I enjoyed my Alaskan roll (essentially a Philadelphia) and the modest but delicious poke bowl with black rice. Service was courteous and friendly, and waters were refilled quickly. The birthday boy was even given a personalized greeting card from R&C for his 21st (no dessert, but the thought still counts).

Order some of their sushi rolls, Shrimp Fried Rice and Sweet and Sour Chicken. The rolls were not bad but not great. Pretty much just standard. The flavors were underwhelming and tasted like something I could make at home. But I love sushi so I definitely finished them. Sweet and Sour chicken was definitely the highlight as it had just the right amount of crisp or the bread and the sauce was not too sweet or too sour. Update the decor, get more attentive servers and experiment with more exotic flavors for the sushi and this might be a 4 or 5 star review.",

The server was either rushed or didn't want to be bothered or...... not sure. I got the hot dang which is yellowfin tuna and support to have some spice to it, I didn't get any heat at all. The fish was good, great quality, almost melt in your mouth. The price was steep, but welcome to Vegas baby. The overall experience was good except for the server, which is why I gave it a 3 stars. I can't knock the food though since that was really good. If you want sushi, roll your dice and come here but for me I'm not a gambler so I would walk on by.",

I ordered three rolls the 4 times I went and each of them were fresh and what I expected and much more, will dine here as much as possible my entire stay every time I'm in Vegas. If you're there ask for Niqi, to be your server, she's the best one, it's like she drank 10 Red Bulls when she got to work running all over the restraunt getting her customers what they need.

    "text": "My parents and I came here for an after dinner snack. We arrived 15 minutes early for OpenTable reservation but the hostess told us to hangout in the lounge until our table was ready.  When you enter the restaurant, there's a lounge area to the right and metal koi sticks in a stone pond. In the dining area, there are high black table tops with red chairs as well as tables with brown booths. One of the walls is made of wood and has orange lit bowls that look like candles. At the sushi bar, there are glass blown bamboo lights. Behind the sushi bar, there are koi panels.   Each table setting consisted of bamboo mat, red chopsticks and silverware wrapped in a brown napkin, white dish and sauce dish, and tall glasses for water.   For drinks, I'd recommend ice water, hot green tea, and Sapporo!  We enjoyed the Wok Chicken Lettuce Wraps, which consisted of chicken bamboo shoots, mushrooms, water chestnuts, scallions. It was five lettuce wraps and hoisin sauce. We also enjoyed the Crab, Cucumber, and Mango Salad, which consisted of fresh king crab, julienne english cucumber, mango, and tobiko caviar in citrus mayo dressing. It was sweet, refreshing, and calming. It's definitely something I'd come back for. However, we were not impressed with the Hong Kong Noodles, which consisted of crispy egg noodles, roasted pork, shrimp, chicken, straw mushrooms, baby corn, and bok choys in oyster sauce. The noodles were not crispy as described. They were mushy! The oyster sauce was super thick due to excessive use of corn starch.",

I went here with my Dad, and we both got the miso ramen with shrimp tempura. The miso soup was good but the noodles were terribly overcooked.  The pork slices also tasted good but were unexpectedly tough.  The rest of the soup items were pretty good.  Now let's talk about the real problem: shrimp tempura.  When have you ever had bad fried shrimp? Pretty much never, but it some how happened here. It was cold, tasted like it was frozen and then refried, and had this weird taste to it from the oil. It was really bad. Even drenching it in my soup did not help. The tempura sauce was also missing.   Well, that sums it up. Take your chances or pass it up, you won't be missing much by skipping out here.",

The noodles tasted a lot like something I get here at home for around $6 instead of $18 but hey, it's Vegas on the strip and they were really good. It has a lot of flavor, veggies, shrimp and pork.

I also tried two drinks, including a red velvet + xo patron cocktail off of the dessert menu -- both were delicious!  Mind you, this place is extremely expensive!  Probably average for Vegas, but $20 for one roll is not a price I'm used to paying. Luckily, I had a $20 off coupon from staying at the Excalibur, so that counts as something, right?

The food was spectacular. Delicious, everything complimented everything else, the flavors were nuanced and delicate yet bursting with flavor. What a treat! It was really 5-star gourmet food at pretty reasonable prices.   The decor is very inviting and modern, with an Asian flair and contemporary flourish. It feels like you are inside, then outside, then inside with so many circular rooms with various degrees of walls, ceilings, and interspersed light fixtures. It is very classy.   Singapore Noodles -- THE BEST! So delicious! They made me a vegetarian version without the pork and shrimp, but with tofu. Aaaaamazing! A touch of curry, exquisitely seasoned. Magnifique!  My boyfriend had the Frek En Good Sushi Roll and loved it. The seafood soup (with squid, etc. was another of his favorites. The mango/avocado sushi roll was great too as a vegetarian option.  And the drinks were wonderful, from the wine to the \"Sexy Lady\" cocktail (!) and the delicate green tea with honey. So soothing after a delectable meal.  Finally, customer service was outstanding both times we went. I read another review and feel bad for the customer who seems to have been treated rudely. This was not our experience, however. We had courteous, attentive, amazing waiters both times. And the hostess made the awesome food recommendations!   Also, being a same-sex couple, we felt welcomed and celebrated, not judged or awkward as is the case too often, unfortunately.   One time the food was a bit slow because the sushi bar was packed and that held up our order. But this minor wait didn't matter because we thoroughly enjoyed our experience otherwise.   5 STARS!!!!",

The atmosphere is pretty decent as well, a tad small. My husband and I don't care, the food is great and we always stop here on our trips!",

    "text": "2-star experience, 3-star food, 4-star value...  Living in Vegas the past few months, it became a weeknight ritual to walk down to Yogurt In at Mandalay Bay after work for the best froyo on the Strip.  During my walk, I would pass Rice & Company nightly as I cut through the Luxor, before and after the restaurant opened.  Eventually curiosity got the best of me, as it looked like an interesting menu and decent environment.  I went for dinner at the sushi bar on Wednesday night around 9pm.  The restaurant was reasonably busy, with the wait for a real table being 15 minutes.  I started with the Crab Mango Cucumber salad, which lists ingredients of fresh king crab, English cucumber, mango, and tobiko caviar (fish eggs).  I substituted the citrus lime vinaigrette for a mayo-based dressing that comes by default.  Those items are actually all that come with the salad - no lettuce less two leaves of romaine for decoration.  In fact, it was pretty much a bowl of crab meat and dressing.  Although this wasn't my expectation, it tasted okay (emphasis on \"okay\").  I was nervous eating the ample quantities of fresh seafood for a $9 price point at the Luxor, but I woke up not sick today so I think I'm safe...  I was planning to move to sushi after the salad, and placed my order atop the sushi bar case.  From there, I proceeded to wait almost 10 minutes for it to be picked up.  I could have shouted for one of the 3 sushi chefs' attention, but decided to make it a service experiment instead.  Twice, a chef walked right in front of me, opened the case atop which my order rested, picked out fish, and left with no eye contact or recognition of my order.  When my waitress finally stopped by, I told her I would skip the sushi and was ready for my check.  Can't say this is representative of service overall, but I wasn't impressed and I was expecting average sushi at best anyways so I didn't feel like I was missing anything.  I actually this this restaurant could do well, given it is an interesting menu, colorful atmosphere and priced in line with Luxor hotel rates.  Not something I would passionately recommend to friends, however.",

As another one of those overpriced, mediocre food restaurants in Vegas, Rice & Company gets 2 stars instead of 1 for their pleasant (but slow) service. Their menu consists of a fusion of Japanese and Chinese cuisines. We ordered a calamari appetizer, two rolls & two Chinese entrees with a side of vegetable fried rice. Except for the appetizer, everything else tasted blah. The pad thai and fried rice were among the worst. I've had better fried rice from the buffet or Panda Express. I can see how most novice tourists would find this place on their wow list though. Truth be told, there are way better Asian food off the strip in Vegas.",

Rice and Company was not busy at all, and near the Believe theatre so we decided that was the place to go. There were six of us and we all loved it. I'm kind of surprised by all of the negative reviews.   First of all we were seated right away as they were not busy at all. Our server as attentive and very helpful. I love sushi and when I started reading the descriptions in the menu, I couldn't decide what to get. It all sounded amazing. I got the philadelphia roll because I love salmon and I'd never had cream cheese with sushi before. My brother-in-law got the Sexy Lady. We shared and they were both outstanding. I was completely in love with the philadelphia roll. I'm a huge fan of wasabi and it was amazing combined with the flavor of the cream cheese. So good! The Sexy Lady was so good too. Amazing flavor combinations. My husband had the kung pao chicken and enjoyed it. I had a few bites and was impressed because it was just the right amount of spicey without overpowering the dish.   I lived in Japan for 9 years and Rice & Company was the best sushi I've had. Or maybe I've just been in the states too long now (since 2007) and I've become acclimated to the mediocre sushi places here and so Rice & Company stands out. Whatever the reason, I loved the two varieties I tried and cannot wait to go back to try more.   But seeing as their prices are crazy expensive, I won't be going back soon and that is the reason I gave four stars.",

Like most, we used the food and drink voucher provided by the Luxor.  That means, after the savings, it costs as much as a regular restaurant.  But you knew that, because you're at a resort.  The overall layout and feel of the place is appealing and inviting.  The staff is top notch and really push this into solid 4 star rating.  Even the bus boy...err, man...was super polite and very attentive.  This is something I have come to expect from the MGM properties staff.  The Chinese dish (beef and noodles) was large portioned and decent.  The sushi was actually very good and very fresh, unlike some reviewers had found.  The Sapporro was huge, and it was expensive, but you expect that because it was at a resort in Vegas.  You can probably do better in Las Vegas, you can probably even do it better for less.  But it's convenient, and that's why you're going to go, but you knew that too.",

We started with the Mad Dragon Roll, Potstickers, and Spring Rolls. We devoured everything, my kids even had seconds on the dragon roll, which I thought I was going to eat myself. For the entrees we tried the Sesame Chicken, Orange Chicken and the Mongolian Beef. By far the crowd favorite was the Mongolian Beef, with the Sesame Chicken at a close second. Not that the Orange chicken was bad just the other 2 dishes were great. To go along with the great meal was great service. We only had water but they were on top of refills, the glasses never emptied. They were so polite and friendly.  I can not wait to go back and try some different dishes.",

    "text": "Before even checking in one of my friends had told me the restaurants were excellent and I'd told him I'd check a few out. After getting off my flight and then walking from the airport, I was starving, and decided to make a reservation for 7:30pm to come here (because it seems when a place asks for reservations, there's going to be a wait if you don't do), walked down, and got shown my seat.  The initial hostess seemed amiable and let me know her colleague would be bringing me to my table, while the second was pretty curt and rushed me to my seat without even really a smile as I'd seen her give the first couple she'd brought to a table. It surprises me still she'd brought me to a table seating for four when I'd made a reservation for one person. I didn't really look around to see if there were any other places the hostess could've seated me since my back was to everyone else (although perhaps the sushi bar?), but could there have been other choices? I'm not sure.  My server, even, had asked me if I was the only one eating, and when I'd said I was she'd promptly cleared away the other settings. I could tell this was somewhat disappointing for her, but it didn't seem to color her treatment of me.  My server brought me the drinks, regular, and specials menu, and after vacillating a little bit between wanting two specific types of sashimi where I would get 16 pieces for $28, having the chef's choice of sashimi where I would get 14 pieces of varied cuts for $36, whether I'd wanted a small hot sake for $7 or hot tea for $5, and whether or not I would get miso soup at all for $10 (begging the question of if the Luxor site calls this place a $$ restaurant, what are their $$$ restaurant prices like?), I'd gone with the sea bass special for $36 that comes with a miso soup and rice, and also gotten the sake.  My soup came out relatively quickly, and it disappointed me a bit that it was tepid to slightly lukewarm. My server also let me know they had to warm up some more sake, so it would be a couple minutes more. When it came out, it too was lukewarm. Still, I consumed both, and they both were reasonably  good despite not being a little hotter.  My main course came out not two minutes after (I guess they kind of wanted me out - understandably - because I'm taking up a four-seat table when I'd overheard the first hostess tell someone else that the non-reservation wait was going to be about 45-50 minutes) and the server assistant (I assume) reiterated what I'd seen on the menu about my dish.  Everyone I'd interacted with except for the busser (who I guess was just matter-of-factly going about his business) said the sea bass was their favorite.  After finishing my soup, I dug into my sea bass. I about died because it was so good. It was buttery, and the miso sauce on the side added to it. They'd served it on top of some nicely crisp bok choy and there was small side of seaweed salad. With all that, the brown rice, the soup, the water, and the edamame they'd provided to snack on initially, I was almost full to bursting.  I admired the attention everyone gave me despite being a \"space-hogger\" in my estimation, and I'd very quickly said I didn't need dessert for I was quite full.  A couple minutes later, my very courteous server brought me my bill (without a pen, but thankfully I had one) and I was on my way.  Overall, my dining experience was average, upping it some because of the niceness, attention, and grace of the majority of the staff, upping it because of the quality of the main course, but downing it because the soup and sake were lacking somewhat from my experiences in previous Asian restaurants where, frankly, I'd gotten a little more than I'd expected for less cost to me.  Still, it was good and filling, so I can't fault them completely for that.",

My boyfriend ordered the general tsao chicken, which he enjoyed, but speaking from an authentic Asian foodie perspective, the chicken seemed a bit commercialized and reminded me a little of Kentucky fried chicken.

    "text": "Most of the Vegas hotel restaurants I frequent are pretty good, so I was expecting good things out of Rice & Company in the Luxor.  I ordered the Garlic Shrimp and Vegetables.  It had 9 plump shrimp, and a mixture of celery, baby corn, bamboo shoots, carrots and mushrooms in a glaze with several whole garlic cloves.  The presentation was good.  The shrimp were properly cooked, but totally flavourless!  I have never had shrimp cooked well that had no flavour at all.  The sauce/glaze was also very weak in flavour.  At a general purpose Chinese restaurant frequented by non-Asians the dish would be $12-$13.  But $28?  I don't think so.  If the food was unique or exceptional, I would be fine with a premium price, but comparing the sushi prices (2 pc for $10), it is approximately double the price for exactly the same thing at another sushi restaurant. The only reason to eat here is if you don't want to leave the hotel.",

We sat by the sushi bar, Toshi, the sushi chef was really nice and friendly. On the other hand, our waiter was pretty impolite. We like a particular broccoli and asked ahead of time for the dish to be made with broccolini instead of regular broccoli. It was fine that the kitchen made the dish differently today but our waiter was just plain rude about it. He didn't even bother to say sorry and try to change it, instead he said I can't do anything about it, you will just have to order another dish? Haha, thanks for the attitude, waiter. Bottom line, terrible service and the food wasn't good, never coming back.",

The  food items are way too over priced for the quality they are serving.  Half the time we had to serve ourselves. We had to sit ourselves, after standing in the middle of the place for five mins, while the servers were walking past us numerous times. When we got seated , we had to find a menu, since it took another 10 mins of waiting around.    We ordered a eel cucumber roll & a spicy tuna roll. It was average. Not that impressive, not that memorable.  Nevertheless, it was a meal that cost me $2, for that I'm okay.",

The sesame chicken wasn't that great and was served rather cold.   This place is outragiously overpriced and by the time the coupon is used it is like eating at a regular restaurant on the strip with better food.  The service was okay not anything to rave about.  If you are offered same coupon, i suggest using it at the bars.",

The specialty roll selections were very interesting...and very good. We had the \"Yes Grasshopper\" and the \"Fre Kin Good' rolls.  They have a wide variety of signature cocktails and we enjoyed the Sake Sangria and the Mamason's Kiss.  I found the entree menu with many traditional Chinese dishes that you usually don't see on the strip without that \"fusion-pan-asian\" flare. Our group tried the Peking Duck w/ mini moo-shu pancakes, Mongolian Beef and Pecan Shrimp.  All dishes were flavorful and the service was attentive. And you must try the Fried Banana dessert. The presentation is over the top!  We will return for sure!",

We did score a table within 5 minutes so things were looking up - our server Jimmy was great and attentive (this was the good) - from there things went quickly downhill. We ordered sushi as an appetizer - took quite awhile to get that dish - finally arrived and was just OK not great for the price. Next we waited a very long awkward amount of time for our meal - I mean like 40 minutes for Chinese food was way out of line - gourmet food maybe but this food is not gourmet and overpriced to boot. Overall - rude hostess - good server - long wait for mediocre food that is over priced - big thumbs down. Sorry!",

We ordered the Hot Dang, Spider, Crazy Mad Dragon and a couple more I don't recall. I was very unimpressed with the sushi. (The Mongolian Beef was good, but not sure how you can go wrong with that.) The rolls weren't terrible, but I definitely had better at a much lower cost. The wasabi was a greater disappointment. It looked like play-doh and had zero flavor. The entire dinner was a disappointment, but the service was great, besides the fact that our waters were never refilled.",

Strawberry martini:  great flavor without tasting like chap stub like many berry drinks do.  We were seated at a pub table which I promptly left to ask the sushi chefs for their recommendations.  They didn't have any.  I asked what was fresh.  They asked what I liked.  I asked if their fish was received frozen and was that why there wasn't an answer.  That was met with an um.  Flash frozen is fine by me.  That's as fee has it gets if it's done on the boat, but some things are in season, and I'd like the people preparing my food to know what is the best thing to eat.  Not expecting much, but we are staying upstairs and have a $20 food and drink credit.  This place closes in 15 mins and by the traffic, I'm not sure how they afford to stay open at all.  If not for the overhead music, you might hear crickets.  They have most sections closed so the area we are seated in looks busy at least.  Had a few rolls which were ok.  The salad with the tataki style tuna was better.  I'd walk by this place and just get a slice from the pizza stall down a ways.",

We started with an order of the leek dumplings and the shu mai.  The shu mai was delicious, but a little dry.  Also there was only 3...usually it's 4 to an order.  The leek dumplings were fantastic.  A little sear on the bottom helped give it a nice edge over other leek dumplings I've had.  My companion ordered the Yang Chow Fried Rice, the Crazy Mad Dragon roll, and an order of eel unagi sashimi.  I ordered the ma po tofu, the Sexy Lady roll, and sake salmon sashimi.    I sampled the mad dragon roll and it was good.  The eel was good.  The salmon was ok.  The sexy lady was ok.  I think you get the idea.  The ma po was a little heavy on the sauce and could use more heat....it was a little sweet.  I'm wondering if they used some red bean paste in the sauce.  I still enjoyed it though.    Everything was ok.  Service was fine....my glass was never empty.    If this wasn't positioned as an upscale restaurant I would actually give this a higher rating.  But for $120 (before our credit), I wasn't too excited about this place.  It was....ok.  I wouldn't mind coming back if someone else wanted to go but it wouldn't be the first place I suggest.",

I have to say, those were the spiciest shishito peppers I've ever had. They were coated in a lemongrass sauce, it was quite unique, & tasty. The hot and sour soup was very flavorful. The Mongolian beef portion is small compared to most Asian restaurants, but still very flavorful. Our server (didn't catch his name) was attentive & helpful. I'd definitely return.",

Today, we came back to make a take out order for a sushi roll we had before of mango and avocado. We were told to go to the bar for take it orders. We went to the bar and the bartender, Jameson, flat out told us they do not custom order sushi. We ordered some other food and sat down in the lounge area to wait for our food.  As we were sitting down, a server named Niqi came up to us to ask if we were ordering anything, we asked about the specialty roll and was thoroughly surprised when she told us that they were busy and she would check with the chef to see if he could make the specialty roll. She came back and said she would put in the order for us.  Originally this place was going to get a 2 star review however thanks to the hardworking Niqi for awesome service their rating went up.",

    "text": "Soooo happy we took the time to try this place!  I am not sure about some of the unhappiness of other Yelpers reviews, this place was great!  A couple issues with Service, I will get into that in a few.  Service: Hostess who sat us was Awesome!  She gave us a choice of table, asked us about our evening and was very interested in conversation, it really set a pleasant tone for the experience.  We were greeted promptly, our server was so friendly and helpful, food came out in a very timely manner.  Downside, when we were done eating we literally waited 20 minutes for him to finally come back over and offer us boxes and the check. Also, my husband was never offered a refill during the meal because after the food was delivered, we did seem to have been a bit forgotten.  Food:  Really, really good.  We started with a Shrimp Tempura Roll, very fresh ingredients.  We just asked for no cucumber. There is a lack of choices on the sushi end as far as rolls go and that was a little disappointing.  Hubby had the Sesame Chicken, very nice portions.  The breading was light and the sauce was not overly sweet.  I had the Asian Chicken Salad, WOW, I will be raving about this salad for awhile.  Chicken was so good, lightly crisp, full of fresh ingredients and a very flavorful dressing.  I was actually thinking how can I duplicate this at home!!!!! It was huge, Hubby and I could have shared and it was only $13.  The reason for the four stars is because of the lack of service after the food drop off and a small sushi roll selection.  We were already talking about when to come back because there were other dishes to try and I'm willing to give the service another chance because it started off good.  Great date night place!  For all three dishes and a soda, came to $52.00 not including tip.  Not bad at all.  Keep Yelpin Y'All!",

The waiter was pleasant and friendly and the food was really tasty, if you want Chinese and don't mind paying and arm and a leg for basic Chinese cuisine then you have to try this place, the Sesame chicken was $23 and the house rice was $22 which is the only reason why I didn't give 5 stars but Welcome to Vegas baby!",

They Spicy Tuna Roll is to die for, SO smooth, SO rich, it'll melt in your mouth and make you go OMmmmG with each bite. The Wasabi Martini is a delight!  Come for Social Hour in the bar area, from 5-7, for a bit of a welcome discount on a few items. Nothing really seems vegetarian on their non sushi menu, but I was told that all the meat entrees can have tofu substituted for no extra charge.  My waitress tonight, Niqi, was amazing, and very charming! Come here, you will not regret it! It only loses a star for the cost, and for the fact that they keep getting rid of my favorite menu items.",

    "text": "I have two check-ins here but I've eaten here at least six times.  I really enjoy Rice & Company.  I eat here almost every time I'm in Vegas.    The first time I visited it was because of MyVegas offer.  With the offer, there is a requirement to order $100 worth of value and then you receive a $50 credit.  The deal is great and makes the meal even more appealing of course.    I used to order a whole fried fish but I didn't see it on the menu this time so that was a slight bummer.  They made up for it by serving up the best calamari I've ever had.  The calamari comes with tons of fresh and hot (spicy) sliced jalapenos.  It was tender and fried just right with the perfect amount of seasoning to accompany the sweet dipping sauce and the spicy peppers.  Thank goodness I had some Hana Peach Sake waiting near my plate to wash it down with.  I'm telling you, this combo is a must try.  My husband had a chicken dish.  I really don't know what it was but he enjoyed it.  In the past when I ate beef and chicken I have ordered sweet and sour chicken from here and it was good.  I ordered the shrimp fried rice.  It was packed full of huge full-sized shrimp that tasted very fresh.  The seasoning was light and free from heavy soy sauce to mask bad cooking techniques.  There was just a slight hint of oil which I loved, no greasy mess going in my stomach.  I thought that it would be best to get some veggies too so I ordered the broccolini.  It was nice and green, cooked just right with crispness still in it and had a hint of garlic and salt.  There was plenty to share with probably three people.   On the way out I couldn't resist trying a dessert that was listed.  I ordered it to go and couldn't believe how huge this thing was when I got back to my hotel.  This was a tower of chocolate cake, mousse, cake, mousse, cake, mouse.  I mean, it's huge.  It came with a sauce that looked like it was strawberry (I didn't try it because the cake was always a lot to deal with) and was topped with two fresh strawberry slices.    This is definitely a place to indulge and get some high-quality Asian fare.  Our waitress was excellent and above and beyond as far as being attentive goes.  Once again, this restaurant has earned my desire to return and try all that I've tried before and then some.",

What those reviewers failed to take into account is that this place is in a casino, and everything has an inflated price.  Even a Starbucks is 25% higher.  All that being said, we had a very good dining experience.  We had the crazy mad dragon roll and the pot stickers as appetizers, and both were excellent.  I had the Pad Thai which was quite good.  It wasn't the best I ever had, but I wasn't upset at all.  My friend got the Hong Kong Noodles and everything was fresh, and the roast pork was very flavorful.  As for the service, our waiter was awesome.  Refills we're prompt, questions answered.  He was great.  If you're in the casino and craving some Chinese food, this is a great place to satisfy that craving.  And for the location, I felt the price was very reasonable.",

If you are craving for some Chinese and have time on hand - a good place to visit . The beans were not crispy or fresh or delicious also they had mixed it with capsicum . Bell pepper is one veggie which will impart its flavour strongly to the food so when stir fried beans has to be served adding capsicum to it , simply kills the flavour .I would stick to Chinese dishes here though :-)",

I got the spicy tuna roll, the dragon roll, and General Tso's chicken.  The spicy tuna was standard -- I went during happy hour so it cost $10.   I was really disappointed with the dragon roll. The staple in a dragon roll is the unagi (eel) and the eel sauce, neither of which this roll had. I should have read the menu better, but I thought it was standard in Dragon Roll. This was $18.  General Tso's chicken was fine. Really nothing special or extraordinary to afford it the $22 price tag.  Overall, I think there are much better options for dining on the strip.",

This time of year, Vegas is pretty quiet, so I didn't have any problems grabbing a seat at the bar.  I had a very nice experience.  I had the spring rolls for an appetizer, and the Singapore Noodles for an entree.  I thought they were both very good.  I will agree with other reviews that my main problem here is the prices.  But the food quality was quite good.  I talked to both of the bartenders, and they were very friendly and prompt.  Both gave me advice on the menu, and warned me on how hot the hot mustard sauce is.  I was glad they did, because it is hotter than I am used to.  But very good.  The Singapore noodles were very good as well.  I was able to watch whatever collage game I wanted to.  I was never rushed, and enjoyed myself there.  I would recommend it.",

The waiter was over the top , answering every question possible , although he did over me a Moscow Mule without the copper cup , We went down a similar path and had them make us what we call the \"Polish Donkey\" and it was completely over the top awful plus 1 .  Food has a nice fusion flair and was served hot and very tasty , price was much less than I was thinking about , along with the quality for a location inside a casio.  Kudos, Kudos, Kudos , can`t say this enough.",

    "text": "Food was mall food court quality.  Nothing special and overpriced.  I'm not a foodie or a hipster.  I started eating healthier, plus I have a number of Chinese friends that have showed me the difference between real Chinese food and Americanized Chinese food.  I figured that I was paying $20+ an entree at Rice and Company that I would get something fairly decent.  I was wrong.  My friend ordered sushi - it seemed alright but I don't know how to mess up sushi.  I ordered sesame chicken with brown rice.  The chicken was tough, overcooked, over-breaded, and covered with a Americanized sweet sauce.  The brown rice was bland.  It was on par with ordering from a Panda Express at a mall food court.   It's frustrating to pay $20+ for an entree that I could buy for $6 at a mall, plus paying $3 for a soda.  I asked for some more rice (since the bowl of rice was fairly small) and I was told extra rice was $4.  I guess what really bothers me about this place is that the ambiance makes it look like a fancy restaurant despite the low quality of the food.  In fact, the hostess did a rundown on my clothes and gave me a look like I was low class (to be fair I was dressed in jeans and a t-shirt).  I will also admit that the table next to us seemed fairly happy with their food.  Although, the lady was using the large serving spoon to eat with and her husband was dressed like a biker.  This made me think that the restaurant was masked as a decently priced Asian restaurant to tourists that have probably never eaten good Asian food - it's Panda Express on a plate instead of styrofoam.",

    "text": "Not sure how exactly to handle this...  The food I had at this fancy-ish Las Vegas casino Asian joint was VERY sub-par.  I had the 8 piece nigiri sushi with spicy tuna roll on the side.  What can I say about bad sushi?  The fish was slimy and way too soft to ever be considered fresh.  The rice was regular chinese style long grain rice, with not a hint of vinegar whatsoever.  The cuts of fish were large, but what good was that when the quality was so very very low.  Service, on the other hand, delivered in spades.  The wait staff really knows what they're doing - the perfect amount of checking up on you and leaving you alone to enjoy your food.  Top notch service - a crying shame the sushi was so terrible.  I'd give it just one star, but I bumped it up 1 for the great service.  A beautiful little spot inside the aging Luxor pyramid - but I'd stay far away from the sushi offerings.  Price wise, it was a ripoff - my 8 pieces of nigiri with spicy tuna roll on the side and 1 small beer was in the $43 range- $50 with tip included.  For that price, I'd head to one of the many Asian buffets off the strip for better food.",

I tried to mumble we could split a bowl of won ton soup and be happy, however the BFF had other plans as she was waving her hands and saying \"dinner is on me.\" Oh no, good money spent on mediocre food.   We ordered the scallop sashimi to start. It was fine. Not amazing but not bad. Next were the singapore noodles which were on the mushy side, but flavorful. They made me long for the ones in my hometown. The kung pao chicken was horrible. The sauce was not spicy at all and basically tastes like ketchup with a bit of oyster sauce in it,  the peanuts were on the side and there was way too much sauce. All of these things make for a middle of the road dish but the bad, old tasting chicken made the dish not edible. (Since I was not paying, I did not say anything other than tell my friend it did not taste very good.) The salt and pepper pork was ordered extra crispy and it was a failure. At least the meat was ok. The beef dish was terrible.   Don't bother ordering the lychee martini as it was a sweet drink (expected) with no booze in it (not expected). BFF ordered a second as I thought to myself I was so glad I was not paying for the meal. (And to lessen my guilt, I reminded myself I was treating, well getting us comped, to Zarkana the next night.)  $150 later (before tip) and it was time to leave with our leftovers. Needless to say, we did not eat them, what a waste of time and money. Why a 2 star and not a 1 star? Our waiter did an ok job.",

    "text": "The hostess told me it would be a 15 to 25 minute wait for 5 people on a Monday night.  Restaurant was about 30% full.  We waited every second of 25 minutes.  I don't mind paying $50 per person when the food is worth it, and I don't mind paying $7 per person when the food is edible.  That being said, we were lured here by a coupon for a $20 credit as well as a False advertisement stating that their food was $15 or less - bullshit.  The only menu items that are less than $15 are soup at $9 and side items at $9 - even the iced tea is $4, and when you have to ask for sugar three times, it isn't all that sweet.  The server was dreadful.  Refills were a lost artform here.  It took about half an hour for 3 entrees (we have 3 children so we share) while nobody could be found for refills.  Then the food came.  The chefs here must have been mathemeticians in their previous career, because they perfectly multiplied the portion of each entree by 2, and divided the seasonings by 4 meticulously before preparing our dinner.  Chicken Fried Rice - the most flavorful of the three entrees, and that is not a compliment.  The rice looked barely fried, the chicken cooked incredibly soft, as if a study was done to see the point immediately after chicken is no longer considered raw and this chicken found it's way onto the plate - I'm not a fan of chicken cooked this way.  Orange Chicken - terrible.  The chicken was so soft and though it looked like the breading would be crunchy, it too was incredibly soft - soft like oatmeal (imagine that).  The sauce was okay, as were the gigantic, not in any way inconspicuous, chunks of cheap vegetables like red pepper and celery through which you might search to find 1 snow pea.  Pad Thai Noodles - oily and flavorless - as if boiled in a reddish food dye and canola.  The best item we ate was the side of white rice with soy sauce, that was great.  The ambiance is nice, modern, cliche and clean.  That's why this place got 1 star instead of the turkey.  Bill was $80 for those 3 entrees and 4 iced teas.  It was audacious and I felt embarassed, like I was expecting Gordon Ramsay any minute to come out and apologize and invite us back for the grand reopening.  I will never step foot into the Luxor again - that's how terrible this restaurant is.",

Look, in Vegas you gotta decide how you're going to spend your money. Eat cheap and gamble it all away? Hit a show? Go big on a trendy restaurant? With a beer, the bill ended up over $100 with tax and tip. Voucher obviously knocked that down a bit. EVERYTHING on the strip is overpriced. This place is decent. Not bad.

We didn't have lunch or dinner reservations but we were quickly seated at one of their tables. We were greeted by their waitress who quickly brought us some water and menus to look over. We decided to order one order of the tuna roll and another of the salmon roll. Each is about $10 dollars. The rolls are super tiny but to be honest, they are pretty fresh and delicious. There is no fishy taste or smell and the sea weed that the roll is wrapped in tasted good. The atmosphere of the places is very calm and quiet. We enjoyed our rolls quickly and soon were asking for the check. Being that we had that coupon, we ended up paying less than $3 for the meal. Unfortunately being that the rolls are small and a bit on the pricer side, not sure if I would come back to have this as a normal meal. They also serve noodles and other rice dishes with Chinese food. One thing I did enjoy other than the food flavor was that even though we had a coupon, the waitress didn't make us feel bad, even after our small order she treated us with respect and friendly. Needless to say, we tipped her well.",

The service and management were really great in corresponding with us, as we kept sending back plate after plate after plate... then had to end the meal having not had one single edible bite and eat elsewhere. They were courteous (as we were with them), and we felt badly toward the server and manager but it just wasn't doable.  We tried the sushi and the cooked kitchen menu items. It was all just a mess. Their entrees (i.e. General Tso Chicken, Singapore Noodles) are priced in the $20-30+ range and taste much worse in quality as Panda Express (which I could call gourmet compared to this place).  The sushi rolls are relatively creative on paper, and then I would like you to imagine placing rancid old raw fish into your mouth. What they call \"belly tuna\" might have looked like belly tuna but I was fooled (shame on me). I will almost take responsibility for ordering belly tuna when it seemed way too good to be True.  I had to spit all of Rice & Company's food out of my mouth. It was incredible. How they still exist and get regular traffic through the place, I understand because it's in Vegas. But otherwise, wtf is the only thing going through my head when thinking about this place.",

    "text": "Sigh. The whole thing was non-optimum. Vegas has so many great restaurants. There doesn't seem to be any excuse for poor performances.  The Mongolian beef was inedible, the charge for a cut roll or hand roll was the same, so I ended up paying $9.50 for one spicy tuna hand roll, and the service was poor. The bill ended up being $75 for mediocre food, it was just disappointing.   Choose something else. There are just so many great choices in Vegas. Go for something with a few more stars.",

Service was very good and the manager walks around schmoozing with the diners and seems like a genuinely nice fellow.  I had the Beef Chow Fun and it was fine. Wasn't as crazy about the Singapore Noodles, though. It wasn't as flavorful as Singapore Noodles I've had at other places. Use the $20 off coupon that you get if you stay at Luxor or Excalibur. It'll take the sting off of the $16 price tag that goes along with the aforementioned dishes.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I started our 'final night out' in Vegas here; motivated by my craving for sushi, and the discount coupon in the Luxor book.  We headed out just a bit before the dinner rush, we were immediately seated, and well served.  We loved the decor; how it created such a different environment despite only being really a corner of the Luxor floor.  Our server was attentive, and helpful, with menu suggestions, input, and answering our questions.  We spent the coupon right away on drinks...ha!  They had a fantastic, creative cocktail menu.  My gent doesn't usually go for liqour, but we each tried several different cocktails, and ended up doubling up on the saki sangria, which was heavenly.  The two sushi rolls I ordered (can't remember now.. it was a month ago...) were AMAZING.  When I get great sushi, I kind of roll around and dance in my seat with a happy sushi buzz, much to the amusement of our server! :)  My BF really enjoyed whatever it was he ordered, something swimming in a white garlic sauce, and he was nearly joining me in the happy buzz dance.  It was not a cheap meal, but he commented ten years ago in Vegas, food was cheap cause they wanted you to spend elsewhere.  That's not True anymore.  Most everything we ate anywhere that week was overpriced and sub-par.  At least we felt totally justified in what we spent for this meal.  We left for our nights adventure full and very happy!",

    "text": "There are about 500 better options for food in Vegas, but surprisingly few places to get Chinese food. On second thought, based on the blatantly racist jokes directed towards Asians at the show that evening, maybe not so surprising? In any event, this restaurant was a quick walk to our show, and my wife had a taste for something light, so we wound up here.  I started off with a Mama-san cocktail which was quite good, followed by the crab mango and cucumber salad. Is that imitation crab? Wow. Maybe my expectations are unrealistic, but I sort of felt like this was False advertising.  I have the habit of asking waiters for recommendations, and in this case I'm pretty sure said recommendation had more to do with the price of the item than whether it would be to my liking. I ended up opting for the Mongolian beef based on a few positive mentions in other reviews. It arrived about 15 minutes later drowning in sauce, along with some very bland fried rice.  For people who have no familiarity with Chinese food served in the cities of New York, San Francisco or Monterrey Park, this might be the place for you.",

Our server welcomed us and told us a few good things on the menu. We started with Demon Slayer Sake (which was not so good, but I blame that on my taste buds), Hot Dang sushi rolls for me and pot stickers for my bf. I have recently started eating sushi and it was amazing, even my boyfriend enjoyed it and the pot stickers were quite good too. For entrees I had the Mongolian Beef which was delicious and a HUGE portion, but the star of our meal was my bf's Beef and Broccoli, or should I say Broccolini. It was amazing, it was so good that we continued to eat it even after we were full.   Our server was amazing. I wish I remembered her name. When we got there she had atleast 2 other tables and by the time she left i counted she had atleast 8 and she was rocking it! She was spot on with everything.  And although I agree that the sushi was expensive, its Vegas, every place I went to felt overpriced, and here the entrees were decently priced for the portions.   I look forward to coming back her on my next Las Vegas visit",

We've been to much better sushi places that had amazing sushi for a much cheaper price, but maybe it was so overpriced because it's inside Luxor. The sexy lady roll ($22) was terrible, looked and sounded appealing but was far from it. We both tried a piece and equally agreed it was by far the worst roll we've ever tasted and sent it back. We went ahead and ordered a rainbow roll ($22) and our generous server, Miguel, was kind enough to remove the roll we didn't like from our bill so we didn't have to pay for it, which I really appreciated. Our glasses were never empty and the service is attentive, we just didn't like the actual size of the individual sushi and the prices they slap on top of that.",

We shared two different sushi rolls, and the orange peel chicken. The chicken was so-so, too heavy on the batter, but a good portion size. The rolls were great, very pretty and tasty as well!  I had some sort of cocktail but can't remember now LOL. Must not have been too remarkable!  Overall the service was good and the food was good, but if we'd actually paid $100 for our meal I would have felt I'd been ripped off. For $50 it was a bargain though!  So a good place to go if you've got a coupon, or don't care about how much things cost. I'd stick with the sushi rolls though!",

    "text": "Rice & Company is a bit overpriced and not the best option to go for Asian food on the Strip/LV area but if you have some food credit and not looking to venture too far from the hotel, Rice & Company isn't a bad choice to shoot for.    Rice & Company is located on the upper level of Luxor as you head towards the Mandalay Bay Mall connector.  It's a fairly nice restaurant and has a good view of most of the pyramid area.    Food-wise, you're looking at a standard mix of American Chinese/Japanese cuisine from sushi to entrees like garlic chicken.  I opted for the Mongolian beef to go along with the Yelp vibe which came with white or brown rice.  For one, it's more than enough (probably just enough for two if you both are light eaters) and was alright.  Again, it is fairly Americanized and won't amaze those familiar with the dish.  It's fairly heavy on the sauce too if that's your thing.  The price is probably the most 'eh' part of the experience - $25 for the beef alone (and along with a beer, it came out to be about $40).  Luckily, I had the $20 food credit from Luxor which brought the price down to what it usually should be.    Service was pretty good with the bartenders being fairly open to chat if you'd like.  The wait to get food was fairly nominal as well.  The restaurant wasn't super busy at 7PM surprisingly on a Friday and the bar was pretty open.  These elements plus the nice look to the area probably brings the score up a tad.    All-in-all, R&C isn't here to blow your mind or be completely inedible - it's convenient and relatively harmless if you're really hungry (and have the food credit in hand).",

I tried the poke bowl appetizer and it was a tad too citrusy for me but still good flavors. My table also ordered garlic noodles with chicken and the dish wasn't advertised as spicy. However, it was very spicy and we weren't warned in advance. The Hong Kong noodles tasted alright but there was way too much sauce that drowned the noodles.  Our server was very friendly though so that helped make the experience better! This is a place to head towards if you are near Luxor and want an average Asian meal.",

The miso soup was a bit salty and otherwise unexceptional. I had a $20 dollar coupon from the Luxor, so it wasn't that expensive. Without the coupon it woulda been $30, not including drinks.

We were very pleasantly surprised.  We started with the Pot Stickers which were AMAZING and both ordered a cocktail that was very good (I got something with vodka, pear juice, sake, and sierra mist, my wife ordered a pomegranate margarita). For dinner, I ordered the Mongolian beef, which was very good and pleasantly spicy, contrary to what is usually presented as \"spicy\".  My wife ordered a spicy sushi roll that she also said had a nice heat to it. Our server was friendly and helpful and we enjoyed a nice quiet meal before our show.

If you have a voucher, I'd definitely recommend coming here. If not, it's not worth it cause it can get pretty pricy.   Food: - Wicked roll: spicy tuna, yellowtail, avocado, cucumber. Even though this roll sounds pretty basic, it was pretty good!  - Hot Dang: a lot of different fish, tempura crunch, spicy mayo. I was excited for this roll but it tasted kind of weird to me. Like the tempura crunch was a little stale or something? The fish also isn't that fresh, but maybe its just harder to get fresh fish in Nevada? But my boyfriend really liked it so maybe it was just me  Drinks: - Godiva Chocolate Martini: This was really good!!! The drink was strong but the chocolate masked the taste very well - Lychee-Tini: My boyfriend got this drink lol. I really liked this one too!  Service: Super fast! Got everything within 10 minutes and the waitress was really nice  Overall, everything would've cost $60 but we spent around $30 with our voucher. I definitely wouldn't spend $60 here because the rolls weren't anything that special. I do really like the drinks though.",

Sometimes I get a craving for the Crab/Mango/Cucumber salad and that alone makes me go. They have a good sized menu of choices. I always opt for sushi. The rolls are great. I almost always order some of the house special rolls. They are good sized and I always leave content but a bit pricey. The rolls look great presentation wise. Everytime I post pictures of them on social media people are asking me where they can get the rolls in the pics. Will definitely be back again!",

And if I feel like I can pay just as much for a meal from my local Chinese place as I did here, and get significantly better food, there's a problem.   Food was bland, uninspired. This coming after a sermon from our waiter that everything was made from scratch.   \"Spicy\" meals barely had any flavor. Let alone heat.   Took forever to get our appetizer. Our meals followed two minutes later, and 2/5 dishes were cold. So your kitchen screwed up. If we hadn't been walking all day and already waiting 20 minutes, we would've sent it all back and told you to make it again after we had a chance to eat our soups and appetizers.   In closing; bland food. Lengthy food prep process. No spacing between apps and main course. And cold meals.   Not acceptable. Tread lightly here.",

    "text": "First of all, let me begin by saying the staff at Rice & Company made this experience the greatest! We had a reservation for a Saturday night, but when we arrived (30 minutes early to the Luxor), there was absolutely no parking at the valet, in the parking garage the valet at Mandalay.  We searched for the next 40 minutes for parking and finally found it at the valet at the Excalibur and walked over.  Seeing we were obviously not going to make our reservation, I called before the time we were set to get there and told them we'd be late.  They immediately told us it would be no problem and to arrive when we could.  After hiking in high heels from the Excalibur, we arrived a bit of a mess about 20-30 minutes after our original reservation.  We were greated with smiles from the hostess as we apologized numerous times for being late.  She assured us it was alright.  As she walked us to our table, the restaurant was somewhat crowded.  A lovely table was waiting for us in a quiet corner of the restaurant, opposite of the sushi bar side.  I say quiet relatively, as the roof of the restaurant is open and you can hear the noise of the hotel.  There is also not a wall to close in the restaurant from the shopping area, so you can people watch as shoppers walk by.  Due to the open feel of the restaurant, yet the lovely design of it all, it provides a middle-scale feel (if that makes sense - not low class, but not a high-end restaurant either).  The waiter was very helpful, telling us the specials, answering questions and provide quick service and clean-up.  Our beverages were always full. The food was delivered at perfect temperature in a timely manner (to include our appetizer). Modifications were made for allergy concerns. the alcoholic beverage was very tasty. The manager checked on the tables throughout the meal and everything was delicious!  The prices were excellent for what we ordered.  It was a lot of food on the plate, but all of it was welcomed!  We would definitely return!",

The service is attentive and the location is attractive. Each trip to this restaurant  costs about 65.00. Our first meal consisted of Honey Chicken and Broccoli Beef with steamed rice. These two dishes were plenty for us. The chicken was white meat and the beef was very lean. The sauces and flavors were excellent. Reminded me of PF Chang's or Fats Bistro back home in Sacramento. During our second meal, we had Sweet and Sour chicken and Mongolian Beef, these were even more delicious than what we had ordered the first time! I recommend this restaurant and would return to dine there again.",

We were recently staying at the Luxor and in need of dinner and a Chinese style feast was sounding good to everyone. We got a table immediately and was drinking in the ambiance of this beautiful restaurant when our waiter appeared to take our drink orders. We perused the menu, and I was immediately taken back by the high prices. Once I got over my sticker shock, we ordered dinner and just figured that we also had to pay for the experience along with dinner. It was not long before our food hit the table, my wife got a few sushi rolls that she said were good. I got an order of noodles along with an order of fried rice. My noodles at first glance were sad, a small pile of plain looking noodles swimming in a large bowl. Once I mixed them up they looked a little happier. My noodles had a good chew to them but the whole dish lacked any flavor until the addition of vinegar and soy. My fried rice was tasty and did not need much additional condiments. Overall our dinner was just O.K, the prices were very high for what you got (portions were small) quality was just o.k and the service was good in a beautiful setting. At least now I know what to expect from a fancy Luxor eatery, but next time I'll just hit the buffet, Aloha",

All the dishes were very flavorful, and my mom (who is from Hong Kong) enjoyed it the most.  The food was a little more on the expensive side but nothing too much, and the serving sizes can be made as \"family dishes\" for people to share (about one person per dish).  On top of that, the restaurant interior is beautiful with statues and ceiling decorations (be sure to look up once at the ceiling)!  The employees are nice.

Got a myVegas rewards deal for $50 off $100 for dinner here and it seemed like the best option of the limited dining choices at the Luxor - and the only place that could accommodate a vegetarian (my SO).    The food is pretty bad.  It's like the sort of Chinese/Japanese mishmash you could find in a mall food court.  Only more expensive.    They made some vegetarian sushi (avocado and cucumber) for my SO and I did a shrimp tempura roll.  Both were about the same quality that you'd find at the Ralphs.  And that was the best thing we had all night.    Vegetarian spring rolls were clearly not fresh and tasted like something from the freezer case at a budget grocery.  Garlic noodles were so salty and tasted of only old garlic and soy sauce.  MaPo Tofu could have been the best dish of the night but was undone by a cloyingly sweet sauce.  Vegetable fried rice was just OK... didn't seem fresh.  We ordered the chocolate cake dessert to take back to our room and it was just a lot of dense chocolate with some not very fresh strawberries and a fake tasting strawberry sauce.    Service was fine (although they didn't even ask us if we wanted anything to drink and didn't refill water - nor ask why we didn't finish anything...  I suspect they know).  The dining room is nice.  But this food is definitely not worth it - and it's not that expensive...  we had to order a lot to get to $100 - but we weren't drinking.    I can't recommend this place.   The food is just very not good.  This isn't even passable Asian food.  Only for the service and the relatively nice room do I give it 2-stars...  I'd never go back.",

    "text": "We were staying at Luxor on NYE and needed somewhere to go for dinner. After perusing the options, we decided to try this place out. We made reservations, although we wouldn't have needed them.  We went with some friends and decided to go family style so we could sample a bunch of items. We ordered the pot stickers, chicken chow mein, teriyaki salmon, black pepper beef, honey chicken and the sausage fried rice.  Overall we all thought the food had great flavor. Problem was, the portions were pretty small for what they charge. I know it's the strip and all, however, the portions don't match the prices.  The service was great. Our waters were refilled frequently, plates taken away as we finished, and the server was attentive.  Overall we all enjoyed the meal. Would I go back? Probably not. There's simply better options on the strip. I will say that if you get the MYVegas reward and are able to get the 50$ off $100 that would make it more worth it.",

    "text": "Okay. After walking back and forth from Mandalay Bay to the Luxor multiple times we stayed with our decision to eat dinner at Rice. They do not have a children's menu so my husband and daughter split the honey chicken. Very tasty. My son wanted sushi so I caved in and let him get what he wanted. I ordered a spicy one and tempura shrimp. I was very happy with my choices.   After ordering the Sapporo, I found the Peach Sake Sangria. This was a perfect end to my meal.   Service was solid from Alessandra. She was very nice and knowledgeable of the menu. And involved my children in conversation.   Service was all around excellent.  From the hosts to the bidder to our server..... A++++",

    "text": "Rice & Company is a sushi bar located in the Luxor Hotel. Before being seated we asked the hostess if she recommended eating there and the answer was not inspiring. She kind of gave us a yes, but it was also kind of a no. I laughed and asked for a table thinking that it would be fine for what we wanted.  I ordered the chili garlic edamame which was really good. The Chili Garlic seasoning was a welcome change from the normal salt seasoning that other restaurants use.  I forgot which roll I ordered but it was really good. I was shocked at the wasabi though. It was very mild with almost a sweet taste to it. It was easy to eat and added a pretty good flavor to my roll.  It was a pleasant and quick dinner and I would recommend Rice & Company for anyone who is ok paying ~$30 per person for a dinner. Prices are comparable to the other restaurants we tried, but more expensive than home (Louisville, KY). I'd honesly only come back if it was convenient and I was really hungry.",

I recommend adding shrimp/chicken bc it literally doesn't have anything but noodles.   Mongolian Beef: this dish also had a lot of flavor with a little kick to it.  it had enough sauce for you people who like to mix rice at the end.   Note, you only get a small rice with it. if you order an extra one it is $4 which is not worth it.  I ate it with the noodles.   Bang Bang Roll: this roll had real crab, 8pieces with spicy mayo sauce on the side and pop rock candy. That is why it's called bang bang.  hmmm... It was okay roll for $22 I don't think I'd order again but remember it has real crab.     Drink a lot of water after so you are not dehydrated.    If you thought it was helpful, please hit those buttons [helpful, funny, cool or send me a compliment ]  Thank you and happy eating!",

But this was just straight up terrible: we were waiting for over 1 hour with no drinks at a table in the bar area. The manager even came out a few times, she was made aware of the problem. She got us a couple of shots and comped them but then forgot everything else. There was ONE girl on duty on a busy night. She was literally running around everywhere and nobody was helping her.   Once we finally got our food, it was gross. I ordered Wonton Soup and the pork inside was gristly and fatty. The Pad Thai was fishy-stinky and the shrimps were very fishy also. Just all around gross.   The thing I feel really stupid about, is that we still paid $155 for this slop and terrible service.",

Rice and company is Chinese although I had a sushi plate and the hubs pork belly ramen. The other had the Kapo soft tofu with vegetables, broccolini and some noodle stir fry. It was all just ok but I wouldn't repeat it. The rice was horrible single whole grain white rice but texture was better for fried rice than as an accompaniment to the main dishes.

Their food is common americanized Asian fare along with a sushi selection. The entrees are similar to what you would find at a nice Asian fusion restaurant such as PF Changs, but it's way overpriced. For example General Tso's Chicken is about $23! Once our food arrived, it was tasty and the staff is very nice, although service was a little slow considering how many servers there were and the restaurant was not very packed. We were staying at the Excalibur and had a $20 food and beverage credit so we used it here. I would only come back if I had similar comp because this place is just too expensive for what you get. The good thing is we didn't leave hungry, so the portions at least are pretty reasonable.",

The service was good. I just wish they had Creamy Scallops.  We had a $20 credit coupon so that put the total price just a touch higher than we've paid at similar style sushi restaurants. Not a big deal for us. For those who complained about the price in other comments, there is nothing stopping you from looking at a menu before hand, and the food court is right down the hall.",

    "text": "I enjoy Vegas and don't mind the higher prices charged at the resorts on The Strip. In return I want an above average experience: an interesting menu, good food and great service.  In my first experience at Rice and Company I got none of the above.  Starting right off the bat, the host and hostess didn't communicate and I went from next-to-be seated (with reservation) to waiting for 2 walk-up groups to be seated ahead of me. They apologized when they realized their mixup, but things started off poorly.  The setting is quite nice and not too noisy. Service was prompt with menu and drinks arriving promptly.  The menu is not remarkable with the \"House Specials\" the same as on any Chinese menu.  I opted for the Potstickers and Ramen Noodles with Tempura Shrimp off the daily special card. The Potstickers were average and definitely not worth the $13 (for 6) price tag. The noodle dish was excellent (loaded with all sorts of meat and vegetable goodies) even though I found the miso broth a bit salty. The $21 price tag was acceptable.  Bottom line - you can get the same menu items for a lot less at other restaurants or even the buffet.  There are much better upscale Asian restaurants nearby (for example, try Noodles at the Mandalay Bay next door).",

    "text": "Meh is right.  We sat up at the bar so we could watch football on their 2 TV's there.  I will say the bar staff is very friendly/attentive and will try to strike up a conversation with you. The music, surprisingly, was really good. The decor is right on for a higher end sushi place that also boosts a very nice selection of moderately priced Sake [me=fan].  Got a bottle of sake for under $40 700 ML #score.  Ordered a spicy tuna roll first to share as an appetizer. It was rather bland for me. Definitely needed more spice, rice was a little underdone for me, and overall lacked the depth of flavor I would've necessarily associate with a \"spicy tuna roll\".  It got a D in my book.    Asked the bartender his favorites he said \"Hong Kong noodles\" {under $20}. Looked it up has a mixture of pork, shrimp, chicken with lots of veggies on top of noodles. OK so I order it [no mushrooms please-they gross me out] and my friend orders Sesame Chicken which comes with Jasmine or Brown Rice, he goes with the latter choice.  Comes out looks...OK.  Tastes very bland but salty??? WTH?!  So I ask for some Sriracha that should help it....meeeeeh maybe not.  And then I found a couple random mushrooms hiding in there- grossie! So not my favorite meal. I gave it a D  Sesame Chicken was MUCH better but it's fried Chicken in a sticky brown sauce with brown rice, how could one really mess this up?  I gave that one a solid B [it was better than mine].  Total bill for 1 roll, 2 entrees, and sake $88 w/out tip.  So what this place really needs to work on is their food and for a restaurant in Las Vegas, that's a tall order!!!",

The special cocktail that was on happy hour was a blue lemonade vodka drink that was tasty but sweet. The bartender apparently agreed and gave me an extra shot to help balance it out. The sesame chicken was grissley and not all white meat which is typical of a locally owned restaurant not a restaurant that would be in a casino hotel. The two rolls I ate were average the pop rocks on the chop chop bang bang made it interesting but it didn't really match up with any sauce that was on there and seemed out of place. The rainbow roll was beautiful and tasted OK however the slices of fish were very very chewy not sure if it's supposed to be that way. The service is so great there and it seems like they're really trying I might give it another chance. Great decor and airy  energy not dark and stuffy.",

    "text": "I dined here twice while staying at Luxor last week and both times my experience was really good, although the first time had better service.  When you check into the Luxor, they give you a book of coupons, one of which is $20 off a meal at Rice & Company. Naturally, I took advantage of this.   I love Asian food, and lately, I have been getting more and more into Japanese food (Ramen mostly, but some sushi/sashimi). Rice & Company bills itself as an Asian fusion restaurant, combining the best of Japanese and Chinese cuisine.   Naturally, I hoped they would carry Ramen, but they do not. That said, they have some wonderful items on the menu.  My first night, I had a server named David who was just incredible. I went on a Monday evening, and called ahead to make a reservation, though when I arrived, it was clear one was not necessary. Still, showing up and having the hostess address me by name was quite nice.  David shook my hand, and then took the time to explain the drink menu, as well as the dinner menu. Normally I'm all about checking out the menu(s) myself, however, since this restaurant was new to me, it was nice to have him explain it. I've never really been much of a sake person, so I pushed myself to stretch my culinary boundaries and ordered a glass of Ty-Ku Coconut sake (cold).  Ty-ku Coconut Sake is Nigori sake (330 ml) infused with coconut, and it was delicious. Potent, but delicious.  For starters, I paid homage to my Japanese tastes with Miso Soup - tofu, wakame, and scallions. It was really tasty and I ate the entire bowl.  For dinner, I had the Singapore Noodles substituting the shrimp (not a fan of shrimp) for chicken. My dish consisted of: rice noodles, shredded bbq pork, chicken, bean sprouts, bell peppers, onions, egg, and scallions, with curry.   The dish was huge, and delicious. David brought me out a small side of sriracha for a bit of spice. I forgot how hot that stuff is!  I was supposed to check out of the Luxor Wednesday morning, but as I was flying standby (my buddy is a pilot), and all the flights were booked going back to LAX, I decided to stay another night. So, technically, I checked out, and then checked back into the same room - meaning, I got another coupon book!  On Wednesday night, I took another trip to Rice & Company, this time I didn't bother making a reservation, but just walked up to the hostess stand. Sadly, they did not remember me this time around.  David was not working, and I was sat in Eric's section. Eric was very personable, knowledgeable and funny, however I found the service to be a bit slower this time around. That said, he also had 6 tables at one point, whereas David only had 3 on Monday. So that said, I am not holding the slight delays against him.  For drinks, I ordered an Asahi Black beer (tall) - a Munich Dunkel lager style beer brewed in Tokyo-to Tokyo-shi, Japan by Asahi Breweries Ltd. The beer was very delicious and was not as \"dark\" tasting as I had anticipated.  Again, as a starter, I ordered the Miso Soup. Really, their soup is very tasty, and is a nice, light starter.  For dinner, I had the Mongolian Beef with white rice: beef with onions, scallions, peppers, and their chili sauce. I asked for sriracha sauce again, though I didn't use it as liberally as last time.  If you like sushi, they have wonderful rolls, including a dish which landed them on the Food Network show \"Heat Seekers\". This roll includes ahi tuna, crab meat, shrimp tempura, micro cilantro, habanero peppers, and a sauce made with ghost peppers (3rd hottest pepper in the world).  A table across the room ordered it, and offered me a sample - I passed - mainly because I did not wish to crash his dinner with his wife. Had it been more people, I gladly would have accepted. He did seem to like it though, and to the restaurant's credit, the ghost pepper sauce was served on the side, for dipping.  Also, they have a sushi bar, where you can sit and watch the chefs create sushi rolls and sashimi right in front of you. They were very entertaining to watch from my table Monday night (Wednesday, I was in a side room).   Even if I did not have a coupon, I would eat at Rice & Company. The combination of foods, combined with great food and wonderful service makes this restaurant a definite \"must do\" when in Vegas. Even without the Ramen!",

NO I didn't order it but I did this for them. The place is very nice. Located right in the Luxor hotel and casino on the second floor. Seating was a breeze. No need to call in ahead for reservations. Our server was knowledgeable and helpful. They had several amazing rolls and I had the orange chicken. Nothing to write home to mom about but it was food. They raved over their sushi so if you are a sushi person as much as they are then this might be a good place for you to try. Otherwise if you are the complete opposite end of the line like myself maybe leave the buffet at Aria or Mirage so you have other options besides just a few items.",

The hostess' were an awful first impression, sharing they'd have a table in 5-10 minutes because they have 2 servers (which is fine) but then continued what they were doing, I had to ask if there was somewhere we could sit and wait they did not offer (and I am 6 mos pregnant) once we were seated took a good 5 minutes to get our menus, the server was one of the most unpleasant I've had.  His demeanor was cold, it did not seem like he even wanted to be here.  Once we got the sushi it was literally the worst I've ever had. I've had sushi from the grocery store that tasted better.. it wasn't cold. It was room temperature which was off putting, it didn't taste fresh at all.  The flavors were lacking.  It was just awful to have raw salmon and spicy tuna that was room temperature...the rolls were dry...just horrible...and it was $50 in rolls... 3 rolls... RA sushi is AMAZING that's where I recommend u go it was fresh delicious and the service was AMAZING the bill was $35 for 3 rolls wontons  and garlic edame!!!.  Rice.... never again",

I ended up getting a prixe fixe meal priced at $37.99 as I didn't want to comb through the menu.  It was a good meal.  I had a dragon roll as an appetizer which was tastey and well made.  For the main course, I had shrimp and vegetables which was actually very good.  The dessert for me was the best.  It was fresh fruit (which had lychee and berries in it) with a side of cream, sweetened just enough, and a wonderful pistachio cookie.   I had hot sake which was fine and a well-made fresh ice tea.   The waitperson and the bartender were very nice, just-right attentive, and knew their menu.  The place had a relaxed ambience and was a nice contrast to the busy casino.  The noise level was low-moderate and I found myself sitting and just enjoying myself for this meal.  The food was nothing I would \"just have to go back for\" but I would go back if I were staying at the Luxor again.  Food=3, Place=4, and Service=5.",

One of my suggestions is to not use that stupid computer and just get the name and number. Faster and you have time to actually interact with the person and not forget their names so fast even tho it was 5 min ago.. (this guy listed his name for Gonzalez and then 1 min later. She looked back up at the SAME guy and asked if he put his name down) wow. Next, me and my girl were walked in by the other hostess who doesn't seem to love the place she works at. I asked \"how's the food here\" to start conversation and all she says is \"oh its good.\" #wtf. We finally sit down and I'm already pissed. They gave us a prefix menu which I wanted to order for me and my lady since it said family style on it and it was a good description and portion. We order from our waiter and the first thing he says is we can't share.. #wtf. Why does it say family style then? Change the description to single style you idiots. HA. Luckily the food saved the day and was quite tasty. We got the dragon roll, shrimp w/ veggie, and their nicely dished dessert N fruit. Only stupid part was that took an hour to bring out. The people that sat down after us had already eaten and paid. #wtf. Long story short, place is a horrible fine dining experience, but the food saved the day, but it could have come sooner. I work for one of the finest cuisines back in LA and this place made itself look like a slow serviced Dennys.",

Menu, prices and general ambiance will lead you to believe that this is an excellent restaurant and then you'd be mistaken.  Husband and I ordered the edamame and the seared Ahi wonton taco type things for apps. Edamame was fine.  Wonton taco things were ok, but a waste of perfectly nice seared ahi...too much avocado and cilantro left the Ahi's flavor almost undetectable. We both ordered the sushi sampler and I had the wok and roll and husband ordered the wicked roll.  Rolls were good.  Sushi was really subpar.  Had I been paying the steep prices, I'd have sent it back....and that's not something I do often.  Service was just meh.  If this meal isn't going to be comped to you and you want some great sushi, I'd suggest paying maybe 10% more and heading to yellowtail in the bellagio....you won't be disappointed.",

Based on my husband's expression, I would say his Frik En Good roll was the best dish we had, but I actually didn't taste that. I had XO string beans, miso soup and an avocado/mango roll, which is a nice option for the vegetarians out there! The miso soup was a generous bowl, but I did not love the XO string beans. They are made with long beans, not regular green beans, and as a result were thin and a bit tough. The sauce had a nice flavor, but wasn't particularly spicy. It wasn't expensive for a casino property, but I feel that the prices adequately reflected the value. For a quick fix of Chinese at an MGM property, I think there are other options that might be worth an extra buck or two. However, they can definitely accommodate a large group!",

    "text": "Really, the only reason why we wanted to come here was to use our $20 dining credit as a Luxor guest, as the few other options/restaurants weren't appealing.   This is one of those, where after the first few strikes, why even bother? Take it as a sign, right? We wanted to come here for a late dinner after coming back from our Grand Canyon day tour. We didn't know they close at 10-10:30pm. What the? Especially in Vegas. Really? Okay, second attempt was coming here for lunch after zip lining the next day. They are closed during the day. Really? We wanted to come here for an (early) dinner that same say, but good thing we looked at the hours, b/c their dinner hours just seem short. We were going to just forget about the place at this point. We still wanted to use the credit, so the last night we were there, we just decided to use it for a couple of appetizers, before going to another place for dinner, as planned...  As if the attempted attempts beforehand weren't a headache.... when we arrived, we were told by the hostess that there was going to be a 10-15 min wait for the dining area, but was given the choice to sit in the lounge area with full service still available, which is what we opted for. We sat down, we waited for at least 15 min, no one ever came to our table. I think after 20 min or so, I finally got up and walked back to the front to the hostess, and asked her if we needed to place our order at the bar. She advised us that we shouldn't and that a server for our section would be available. Our server came shortly after I sat back down. Although friendly, she wasn't apologetic for the wait. My sis order a sushi roll and I ordered the veggie spring rolls. More waiting indeed. First, neither of these are entrees. Second, there is not much cooking involved in either of these, especially the sushi. We probably waited around 20-30 min for our food to come out.   Around this time, we noticed a couple coming through the back of the lounge and sat down at the table next to us. The same server greeted and assisted them. After browsing through the bar menu for a while, the couple got up and left. Ha.  Our food was actually pretty decent. My sis liked her sushi roll, as it wasn't full of rice and it was packed tightly. My spring rolls were pretty big and filled with veggies.   Other than refilling our water once, our server never really checked up on us.   Aside from the credit, good thing I also had enough and exact cash for tip to leave without waiting for the server to come back as who would have known how long that would have took.  It's a shame, b/c the food was pretty decent.  Service, or lack there of, was horrible",

The food quality did not match the price tag.  There was nothing special or unique about the presentation of the food.  The only wow factor is that they charge $9 for miso soup and $12 for two pieces of salmon.  You can get far better food for way less money.  Though we did not order any of the sushi rolls, they seemed relatively creative as far as sushi rolls go.  The staff was helpful and pleasant and the food came fairly promptly.  They focused on trying to sell us all of the spicy sushi rolls.  I am guessing this is a specialty for them.  Glad to see that other Yelpers have had somewhat better experiences.",

Not a surprise, it's in the Luxor, not Chinatown, San Francisco. Still, my fiance really enjoyed his sushi, and was pleasantly surprised to find one of his favorite rieslings available by the glass. The only negatives were the people we encountered there - the hostess was fairly rude, and made us wait 10 minutes for a table (the restaurant was practically empty, it was a Tuesday night) and our server didn't seem to want to be serving us too badly. Much emphasis was put on the proper tipping amount on the check. If you're so worried about it, why don't you just put a gratuity on there? We were a party of 7, although three were kids. Still, that's pretty awkward - I get that Vegas restaurants serve a LOT of foreigners who may not understand our tipping customs, but seriously. Also, the bill for the two of us was $80 ($100 with tip) - a bit steep for the 2 entrees, 2 appetizers and one glass of wine that we ordered. I would go back if I had one of these $50 off promos others have mentioned, but probably wouldn't pay full price here again.",

    "text": "Sadly, this was the WORST dining experience OF MY LIFE.  My fiance and I were staying at the Luxor and decided to go here for dinner. While the place looked nice (pretty decor), I did note while there that the place was never full. Now I know why.   Went in, was seated, then asked the waitress about her recommendations. I decided on what I wanted and told her so, and then she just said \"Ok\" and walked off! Didn't take my fiance's order either! We were too shocked to immediately respond. So we called the manager who was aimlessly wandering around (as were a number of staff - they had 12 people at least walking around the floor, which was less than the number of tables occupied). She said she would handle it, then ANOTHER waiter came over, introduced himself and took our order, saying he would look after us.  We waited for our food and then a DIFFERENT lady gave it to us. Strange. I noticed that the couple of across from us paid and were complaining to our first waitress, saying that their food was cold and they weren't happy. And another couple next to us asked how come they didn't get menus when they sat down.   Our original waitress came back to check on us, but didn't communicate where she'd been the whole time. Very confusing.   So I then told the hostess who was also walking past and said the service was substandard and confusing, and that the first waitress didn't properly take our orders... The original waitress came back and rather than just saying it was a miscommunication (which I would have accepted), accused me of not talking loudly enough for her to hear! Number one rule in customer service - don't be aggressive and accuse the customer!! Argh.   They explained that the way they work is \"unique\" and you don't have one person as your waiter and we just \"didn't understand them\". Do I have to understand this, can't I just get my food?!  In the end we got a discount, which the manager gritted her teeth about (we had to fight for it, she wasn't going to give one initially, she charged us the whole bill). Then as we were leaving the original waitress, Katrina, said to us \"I hope you trip on the way out.\" If you can't serve customers properly and take feedback, then you may as well fire yourself.  Totally sucky experience. Pity, as the food was actually okay.",

The husband got some egg drop soup since he wasn't feeling well (don't eat at the Pyramid Cafe!) and it was quite good. A little pricey for a bowl of soup, but good. I got the Wicked and Wall Eye Knee rolls. They were also pretty dang good. Not the most amazing sushi I've ever had, but pretty solid, still. Only slightly more expensive than sushi at non-Vegas venues, which isn't bad. Our total bill for the soup and 2 rolls was $38.   Service was very attentive but not annoying. My water glass was always full and when we needed a box and the bill pretty early since the Husband was sick, they were quick and understanding.   Overall, if you're looking for a good dinner with a nice atmosphere, Rice & Company is a good bet. I would go back again!",

Soup was fresh and had a lot of items and was easy to share. The sushi was a huge surprise. The rolls were fresh, large and all came at the same time !  It drives me NUTS when i order sushi and rolls come out one at a time in dribs and drabs... Rice & Co was better than my special Valentimes sushi meal at Kumi over at Mandaly bay. Check out my review of that visit :)",

I want my waitress to pay attention to my order, get things right, and not try to disappear off for a smoke break if someone hesitates for a moment while placing their order.   When I'm told that you have the best sushi on the strip, and said sushi contains a tempura-fried shrimp, I expect it not to be soggy with oil which clearly hasn't been changed since the place was built.  When I order the Peking Duck, I expect the legs not to be burned to in-edibility. I expect it not to be covered in grease. I expect to get enough little pancakes to make several duck rolls out of a whole duck, and not be charged an extra $5 for a few more of them.   I expect a Philly roll to use FRESH salmon, not the smoked shit I get in bulk at Costco.   When I pay out the ass for dinner, I expect to be wowed.   I was not.",

The pasta is over cooked and it's sooooo sweet, it's overwhelming. I was starving and forced myself to eat it but I used a lot of chili sauce to balance the taste. My husband got the seafood soup and it was also terrible. The soup had no flavor what so ever and the scallops, shrimp, calamari, and fish where way over cooked. The soup actually tasted like it was previously frozen and reheated. The sushi rolls are tiny so if you are going to eat at Rice order more than one roll. Over all the food was not worth the price. I did not complain and ate it anyways since I was starving after a long drive to Vegas but I will not ever eat here again and I do not recommend it. Go somewhere else.",

At $18 the roll was pretty overpriced, but the 8 pieces I got definitely hit the spot. Anywhere else this would have been like a $12 roll. Gotta love Vegas prices..... My $10 glass of sauvingon blanc was delish, and the bar tender was friendly and attentive.   I felt like compared to many nearby eateries, Rice & Company served decent portions for the price. Some of the noodle dishes going by me looked really good and were by no means tiny. I actually wish I had come back here to eat, considering some of the less than stellar meals I had in Vegas.   Solid choice for Luxor / Excalibur patrons.",

The tables/seats were a bit unusual in the dining areas so I sat at the bar which was long and not busy (about three others were sitting at the bar all spaced out) for a Sunday afternoon. When I approached the hostess about seating at the bar she was a bit annoying about being 21. I understand that I look 12 but you do not be annoying about it. I ignored her and went straight to the bar. Why would I show the hostess my ID when I will just be bugged for it again at the bar? I don't understand people...  Anyways... The food here is overpriced and the portions in my opinion were a bit off. The bartender was unkempt and sniffling (gross) as well as complaining about other restaurants in the Casino, stating that the T&T Bar wouldn't last more than a year. Why do I care and why are you telling me about this? I already am in here paying for an overpriced miso soup (I have never paid over $3.00 for a relatively large portion of miso) and my boyfriend's sesame chicken was gross and COLD. His chicken was actually served COLD. He was too hungry for me to say anything so he ate all of it. But in the end we would tell everyone to go to PJ Changs or Pei Wei over this place.",

Plus the food (I had the wicked roll and the beef chow fun) was pretty good overall. On the other hand, the tall skinny Asian lady working the front entrance was a total snob, and the food was incredibly pricey. $18 for a bowl of noodles when I could get almost the same dish and at a larger size for half that price in Alhambra, CA?   Yeah, like another reviewer said, this place is more like a \"take their money now and hopefully they'll come back\" type of place. Maybe I might be the type of sucker that'll go back, because I thought the food was decent. But I'll be a lot more frugal next time. Assuming the hostess in the front won't be acting stupid.",

We ordered our drinks and give or take 5 minutes later he came back with our drinks. We started with appetizers then the dinner course and then dessert! Everything was so amazing here!

    "text": "Only came here to use the complimentary $20 credit as a Luxor guest.  Was already disappointed that they weren't open during the day or late night, only standard dinner hours really.  Hostess tells us we can sit in the lounge area, which is still full service or wait 10-15 minutes for the dining area, even though I saw a few empty tables there. We chose to sit in the comfy looking couches in the front lounge area.  We waited 15+ minutes for anything...water, menus...nobody. We saw two staff people walk by and even though they weren't our waiters, they could have informed whoever need be that we weren't being helped at all. Granted, we were hard to see as being blocked by a giant pole, but still. The bartender was in clear view in front of us, who could have informed any of the staff. My sister finally went up to the hostess to tell her that we had been waiting a long time without anyone coming by.  Our waitress comes and gives us the menu and waters and while friendly, she didn't apologize at all for keeping us waiting.  I order the yellowtail jalapeno roll and my sister had the veggie spring rolls, just enough to use the credit. Of course, these two small items, in which one doesn't even have to be cooked, took another 30+ minutes. During this time, a couple slips in through the side entrance and seats themselves next to us. A waitress notices them and asks if they would like to see the dinner menu and the couples says 'yes.' Well, they waited 15+ minutes and that waitress never came back and there goes the couple and future business.  Our food finally comes, and it was actually good. My sushi roll didn't have too much rice and was rolled very well, as it didn't fall apart. Yellowtail and jalapeno were as plentiful as much as a roll could fit. The veggie spring rolls portion was much larger than anticipated and was jam packed with veggies.  The rest of our service was kinda alright? Water was refilled, but she still never asked us how we were doing, and didn't offer to take my empty plate away. Took a bit to get our check. Luckily, we had the credit and a bit of cash to cover a small tip and the tax, so we didn't have to wait any more at this bad establishment. Too bad, we actually enjoyed our food.",

    "text": "Should've read some of the reviews.   Our server was almost nonexistent since we didn't happen to order a lot of high priced items. It was two of us and we just wanted a bit of sushi, not a party platter of dinner. I tip exceptionally well regardless of cost of food, so if I get great service just ordering a water for my drink, I'll tip 60% for them. This did not happen this time. He was really attentive to the table next to us that got a single bottle of wine. I could tell he had no desire to return to our table unless of was really necessary for him to.   For the food, I've eaten sushi at numerous places, and this one did not meet any expectations. I usually order eel and it's always delicious, but this place had my eel practically burned. It was charred and crispy and totally ruined the taste. The rainbow roll wasn't bad, but I did expect it to be above average for the price and the rice tasted...off. I can't quite describe it, but it didn't taste as I thought it should.   I gave it 2 *s for the atmosphere and the fact that it wasn't a total waste.   I don't think I'd recommend this place as a sushi dinner for anyone looking for a good place to go. If you're in the hotel and don't want to wander too far, this place should be fine as a quick stop.",

I ended up dipping it in the spicy sauce (which was supposedly mango salsa but did not taste like that at all) that came on the Wock and Roll, which made it better!  The Wock and Roll was good, but I couldn't taste the spicy scallop at all, which was the reason I ordered it.  Service was nice and pretty quick! I went right after the restaurant opened for dinner so there weren't many people.  I got $20 off for staying in the Luxor, but I don't think the meal would have been worth the price without the coupon!",

During that time, a show just got out and I was helping her mother read through the menu.  When my girlfriend returned, she yelled \"Where's my purse!\"  Yep, someone grabbed it right off the back of her chair.  We reported the incident to no resolution, but found out a few interesting facts.  There are several cameras in the bar, but they are all pointed at the registers.  The cameras overhead around the theater area are only to cover the entrance/exit of the theatres because there is no gaming in the area.  I'm guessing the thieves know this also because there is NO camera coverage of the bar dining area of this restaurant.  Safety is generally taken for granted when eating out, but be warned.  Unless you are a cash register, your well being is 100% in your own hands here.  As for the food portion of the review... we did order the war wonton soup to get started which came out while we were filling out an incident report.  It was as good as any Chinese delivery restaurant, but the feeling like we were being an inconvenience for trying to report the theft probably killed my taste buds.  We even had to wait for a manager to comp the soup because we didn't want to eat dinner there after dealing with security... or the lack of.",

The waiters were incredible friendly and knowledgeable the decor is very modern and hip.  They have a wide variety of stuff on the menu.  All of it looked great on other peoples tables we were iting around.    My wife ordered the Singapore Noodles.  It had a really unique spice profile. The noodles were soft and slurpy and the dish was made with egg, shrimp and cilantro.  Delish!   I got white tuna sashimi and an Alaskan Roll.  It was and delicious.    Rice and company is a bit overpriced. But, if you're staying at the Luxor, there will be great coupons in the coupon book they give you when you check in.  There will also be great Yelp coupons on the Yelp app.  We used all of the above.  So we had an upscale meal with very cool ambiance at a hip modern place and by the time it was done, it was actually quite inexpensive!",

I started off with a pot of green tea and some of the beef potstickers.  The postickers were delicious!  Next up was some sushi.  I ordered the tuna rolls as well as the \"Wicked\" rolls, which was like a spicy tuna roll with some other fish on top (I forget what it was).  The plain tuna rolls were kind of lame, I found the roll to be kind of rubbery.  It wasn't bad, just not that great.  The wicked rolls, on the other hand, were delicious.  Absolutely perfect.  I also had a bowl of the egg drop soup, which was excellent.  The waitress was very pleasant and the service was great.  Price wasn't too high considering it was Vegas.  I think tip included I paid something like $65.  If I was in the mood for sushi on that side of the strip, I'd definitely stop back in.",

Not only because the cultures USED to clash but more so because the type of storage required is so different that...it would take two restaurants' sized storage to do. This can be costly for an owner.   They pulled it off and even in an elaborate and exquisite setting. Considering this, the prices are extremely reasonable. I tried both the Japanese side and the Chinese. I did lean more towards the Japanese. Freshness in Japanese cuisine requires more attention and that could be why I was focusing more on that so when it was good, it stood out more. But, honestly both the sushi and stir fry was exceptionally good.    I would recommend the sushi first. Again, though, it's always good to have the option. Will surely go again when I'm in the area and craving for either.",

The food arrived and before me was the most aesthetically pleasing arrangements of meats, noodles, and vegetables I have ever seen. The scent of broth, and something amazing punched me in the face, making me plunge deeper in awe. Not only was the food as beautiful as the Luxor itself, but it tasted amazing. The noodles and broth combined to create a warmth, and euphoric feeling equivalent to a rush of adrenaline. Although it was a little pricy in the upper teens, it was one-hundred and ten percent worth it, and I hope to enjoy it all over again someday.",

We then ordered the tempura platter which was a complete waste of $18 - the flavor was just ok and it only came with 3 little shrimps, 3 asparagus (I've never had asparagus tempura) 2 sweet potatoes, and three huge pieces of onion. I was disappointed in the size and choice of veggies. The menu doesn't tell you what kind of veggies you get either, had I known before I wouldn't have ordered it.

After a warm-up with the Wicked Roll (which was made extra hot to \"warm up\" my husband before he took on the FBD roll) we quickly realized this restaurant was beyond talented.   The staff was just incredible! From our first interraction with the manager who absolutely made us feel welcome to our waiter the service was A+. I don't eat sushi so I enjoyed beautiful shrimp tempura as an appetizer followed with Mongolian Beef which I will tell you has some kick to it.  The tempura green beans were so delicious and the beef in my main course was super-tender and flavorful!  Back to the sushi--my husband enjoyed his Wicked Roll and we both were very pleased with the visual presentation and the skills we observed by our sushi master.  After finishing the last little morsel from the Wicked Roll we enjoyed the show of the creation of the Fire Breathing Dragon roll.  Since my husband doesn't eat fried food the sushi master replaced it with eel which was beautiful.  This roll features spicy crab meat, two chopped jalapenos, chopped ghost chili peppers and is topped with BOTH a habanero pepper sauce AND a ghost pepper sauce and finished with a flourish of, get this, Pop Rocks!  Long story short this officially became the hottest food item my husband has ever eaten.  Within a few minutes of him eating the first piece he could no longer feel his tongue.  After a few more pieces his lips and entire mouth was a bit numb and by the time he finished his throat was numb and yet he still felt the burn the whole time.  I swear, I don't understand WHY he wanted to take it on but he swears it was amazing and delicious.  All I know is visually it was beautiful and the overall experience was definitely a memory we will enjoy for quite some time to come!",

Unfortunately, the food was mediocre at best and the service was atrocious.    Our server said they were known for their sushi.  Both the Mad Dragon and the Philly roll we had were flavorless and boring.  She also raved about their Peking Duck.  Granted I compare all Peking Duck to the duck at Peking Gourmet and that is a high bar.  But this was overcooked, greasy, and the serving was downright silly.  They folded the pancakes up to make it pretty but that ended up tearing each pancake, making them impossible to roll.  They only gave 6 pancakes for a whole duck then charged $5 for additional pancakes!  We also had the Orange Peel chicken, nice flavor but barely any chicken on the plate.  The Shrimp Tempura appetizer only had three shrimp on it.  Granted it had two onion rings, two asparagus, and two sweet potato pieces, but they should call it a tempura platter or a mixed tempura platter because the shrimp were definitely outnumbered and not the star of the dish.  I'm giving them 2 stars instead of one because of the cleanliness of the restaurant and the tastiness of the mango gelato.  We paid $180 for the above with no alcoholic beverages, in fact three of us just had water.    So as another had posted, if you want to spend your money on overpriced, tasteless food with non-existent service then DEFINITELY come here.  Otherwise don't bother.",

We sat in what was like a rotunda with drapes along the side.  I really like the ambiance and the restaurant was full but not too noisy and I could still enjoy a good conversation.  We split a caterpillar roll was was okay - but not anything memorable and had half roasted duck with a side of white rice.  I thought the duck was cooked very well and just the perfect amount of seasoning.  The meat was tender and skin slightly crispy but not too much.  It came with hoison sauce and rice paper.  Husband had the sake sangria and said it was \"just okay\" but quite strong. I took a sip and if they just added a little more, as might as well call it a martini.  Overall I do have to say that the service was really good and waitress checked up on us but not in an annoying way  to make sure everything was sufficient.  Would still like to come back to try more dishes!  I did remember overhearing another couple at a nearby table exclaim \"what? $8 for a friggen miso soup?\" hmmm I didn't try the miso soup but it hope it's worth the $8!",

I feel like waiters overall in Vegas wants you to over order so that they make a bigger tip. We've consulted our waiter on serving portion and they turned out to be much bigger than he described. Needless to say, there were plenty of food left and I noticed this happened to other tables as well.   The food is just OK and I would not come back.

After the ceremony I had no time to meet with my guests and my husband for post ceremony drinks instead I had to go to the rice and co and listen to the POS manager tell me they can't let you have cake here. Wtf?!?!? She also told me they don't look at reservation requests until day of. I understand if you can't have it sourced food but they should have let me know since I have them a months notice. She was so rude I was in my wedding dress being told go somewhere else she was so rude she was incredibly disreapectful worst customer service ever. They have no respect for people with allergies and clearly no understanding for dietary needs. The hotel was embarrassed by her behavior and comped our 140$ hotel fees and offered us a free meal at the buffet. But I couldn't eat there because the buffet had nothing gluten free.

So I moved on to the sushi, easy peasy, when the rolls arrived it seemed as if because I said no crumbs/cucumber the sushi chef took it as an insult. The roll was loose and I was a little disappointed with the taste. Nothing like the awesomeness of my previous experience. Then my guests questioned me as to why I would choose such a place knowing my food allergies lol",

    "text": "Okay, when I went for my first time in August, there were no spaces available other than bar (which was fine for me) we had a great bartender paid attention to us, gave us recommendations ate our whole dinner there, it was amazing, especially when the manager came out to ask how everything was, I love attentive management.   We decided to come back a few days ago on November 20th, we had reservations this time, and first we sat at bar then went to our table. Our waiter was friendly and VERY knowledgeable, the woman manager was around checking on this too. My boyfriend proposed to me and everything was going perfect!   I saw a family that looked less than pleased about their dining experience but if they were in such a hurry, then that is not a place to eat, its about the dining experience, not how fast the food comes out. Great ambiance, I am a huge fan of Asian food so this place was perfect for me.   We also got a complimentary Peace Love and Sushi roll because of our engagement. This is great place to go to and we will come here everytime we go to Vegas!",

    "text": "It's not enough to inspire me to change the star rating on my review, but it is worth noting that David, the General Manager of Rice and Company, contacted me to express his concern and regret about the lack of service I received on my visit. That's the kind of attention to customers I would have liked while I was at the restaurant. Maybe there will be some kind of trickle down effect, or whatever the economic term might be, but doubtful I'll volunteer to test that firsthand the next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Honestly I have to rate this place on two different scales: 1 - The food: Just meh...it was food. Not good, not bad....just....food. My friend had the Fre Ken Good sushi roll and liked it. I would give it 2 stars on this rating system.  2 - Everything else: Really, really good. Our waiter couldn't have been more (or at least gave a good appearance of) being invested in our enjoying the meal. There was another guy constantly checking on our water. The place is nice, great atmosphere. I would have given 5 stars for the service, except for our food runner. She brought out the food, placed it on the table and asked if there was anything else I needed. I asked if my friend could get a drink. There is an attached bar area where you can also eat, and cocktails are on the menu. She said \"That's the bar\". I bit my tongue and did not respond that I was perfectly aware of where the drinks came from....I just had no idea why she said those words. Seeing my confusion, she condescendingly stated....while twirling her finger around while it was pointing downward....\"I do food\". Now, since I don't know what their job boundaries are, I would have thought it would have been appropriate for her to say, I'll send your waiter right over to take that drink order...or something like that. Anyway, it was the only blemish on an otherwise excellent example of good customer service. So...4 stars there. Leading to my 3 star overall rating.",

He ordered the teriyaki chicken with a house salad.  He said it was good but he really liked the salad.  I ordered some sushi and the chicken fried rice.  It wasn't the best sushi Ive ever eaten, but it was pretty good. The rice was delicious and I found myself craving it later on.",
