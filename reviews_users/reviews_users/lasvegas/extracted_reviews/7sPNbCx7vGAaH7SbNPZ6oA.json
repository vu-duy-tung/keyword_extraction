    "text": "I've heard a lot of good things about Bachi burger yet never made the time to actually try it out. The reviews on here are mostly positive from what I've seen, with the majority of the problems coming from complaints over service/having to wait (which I think is a ridiculous thing to complain about in the first place). Customer service is a big deal to me, but since everyone says the food is on another level, I finally decided to give it a chance. And OH BOY am I glad I did!  I came in around 5pm and I could tell it was pretty busy at first glance. I was almost instantly greeted by a friendly young woman, despite the rush. I believe she said her name was Bianca. I was almost taken aback since it seemed pretty hectic and she was still so polite and charming. After reading the reviews on here I was expecting much worse right from the start! I can't stress enough how impressed I was though, she seemed to be doing more than one job yet still made it a point to update me on how long I'd be waiting (about 20~30). Left a great first impression and actually ended up waiting shorter than expected even!   I took a seat at the bar with a buddy of mine and I have to point out how they had the menus organized. Everything was easy to find and having the ingredients all on there for each item is a simple, convenient idea. Aubrey was also very helpful in explaining the menu, the variety of drink choices, and just how everything worked there in general. She really knew her stuff!  Everything looked tempting to try honestly, but I was feeling more of a ramen mood than burgers. I'm a huge fan of ramen and I'm constantly trying to find the best of what Vegas has to offer.  And if you're a fan of ramen like i am, Shoku ramen is definitely a MUST. Oh man, it blew me away. I kept it simple with an order of the spicy tonkotsu and was considering ordering extra ingredients, but I was assured the serving size would be more than accommodating. (And I'm so grateful for that advice) The bowls were a little larger than what I usually expect and I was very happy about that! Especially considering how delicious it was. The broth fused perfectly with all the ingredients and that tontoro is seriously out of this world. I even had to order extra of it because it was so good, literally melts in your mouth. I got a lychee soda paired with that which was super tasty, a little too sweet for me to finish though. I also tried a 21+ caramel milkshake which was pretty interesting. Maybe a little \"too spiked\" but really nothing worth complaining about because it was still great.   The staff all seemed really nice and while I noticed some of them did appear to be \"goofing off\" with each other, it really didn't halt or even delay any service. I can appreciate a restaurant with friendly people working there, and it's always nice to see staff get along. With the service getting so much gripe on yelp I was expecting the worst, but then again I'm not a stickler for little things. I know how it is to work in a fast-paced environment and a busy restaurant. I know how it can get so maybe that's why I'm a little more sympathetic toward it, but as long as everyone is handling their work and getting stuff done in the restaurant, it's no reason to give anything less than 4 stars. A lot of the complaints I've read on here are now starting to sound more trivial, appearing to be people upset over things not being catered specifically for them. Just cut the workers some slack, and try to realize they're working hard to get things done for everyone in the restaurant.  Besides that though, I definitely plan on returning soon to try one of their famous burgers! I noticed that some of them were pretty huge, but if it's too big for you to handle you can easily cut it into smaller portions. If you're someone who doesn't sweat the small stuff, and don't mind waiting then I definitely recommend giving this Bachi a try. If you're in it for some delicious food and a friendly atmosphere then this is the place to go!  Don't let the negative reviews steer you away, it's definitely worth your time to try it out at least once! Your taste buds will thank you :-)",

    "text": "1st complaint- Completely overpriced.  $12 burgers with no side and a $10 beer!  2nd complaint- Burgers were eh. Asked for medium, got practically rare. Flavorless. N-N-Out makes a better burger for a fraction of the cost.  3rd Complaint- I'm in my 30's and I don't love loud music but I don't mind it and it's not something I would usually complain about but when techno trance music is playing so loud on a Monday afternoon that you can't even have a conversation with your own party... it's too loud.   Last and BIGGEST complaint- I'm still in shock by this... I ordered iced green tea.  I took one drink, it was horrible. Tried to pass it along to my friends but everyone thought it was horrible. I told the waitress she could take it because I didn't like it.  Her very first response was \"Well did you already drink out of it?\"  What??!!  Are you kidding me?!  What was she gonna do, give it to someone else?  My natural response to her was \"of course, that's how I know I don't like it!\"   Her next response shocked me more than the first... I kid you not, she said \"Hmmmm, I'll have to find out about this\"   HMMMM????   I almost walked out then.  She came back several minutes later to let me know her manager would take it off the bill this time.  If I would have drank half the tea, I'd understand but there were 3 drinks taken out of it.  Worst manager ever!   Waitress was all around horrible btw.  The whole experience was horrible.  $70 for 3 people. 3 burgers, 1 order of fries and 1 beer.",

    "text": "Burgers are excellent... especially for Las Vegas.  There isn't a crazy plethora of burger places here like there are in So. Cal.    However, its too busy and super disorganized.  Its a poor use of space and the staff isn't trained well enough.  They should learn to maximize use of the space and at least seat people.  They're not the most accommodating so its hard for me to bring people or go back even though I loved the food.    The service isn't great.  They tend to forget things and they can't seem to keep everything moving.    I wish I could make this a regular spot because its just as good as umami (which has smaller portion sizes) and stout (with more food options... but much less beer choices) but I won't wait this long just to get a burger.  It would be great to have a bar area or find a way to get people in more quickly.",

    "text": "I'm middle of the road on this one. After watching this local joint on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives Guy F. did a great job talking this place up. I think it left me with super high expectations, so I'm trying to be fair here.  The food itself was really good. I had an entree salad, hubs had oxtail fries. I don't think the portion sizes matched the price tag; after tip $28! I get that you pay for quality ingredients, but on an entree salad I doubt the amount of chicken I was served really justified a $10 price tag considering the portion size.  I was a little bothered by the lack of description of the dish. My salad for example said: House Salad, description: free-range chicken. Nothing else. What bothered me is I had to ask about dressing, didn't think to ask about what else is in it as house salads are pretty generic. So color me shocked when it came with walnuts. Um, what if I had a severe nut allergy? Don't you think that might have changed my order?  The atmosphere was... dull. Waitress had 0 personality, the clientele was yuppy-hipster types (not my thing). The place had no personality, just some enlarged photos of Japanese store fronts.  I don't know. I just didn't get it. 5 star on taste, 2 star on everything else, meet in the middle for a 3 star on yelp.",

    "text": "For day two of my friends' bachelor/bachelorette Vegas extravaganza we went to Bachi Burger for lunch.  Menu: - Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries ($11.50) - Salt and Pepper Garlic French Fries ($4.00) - Truffle Parmesan Fries ($4.00) - Shogun Burger ($25.00) - Kalbi Burger ($9.00) - Kiki's Burger ($10.00) - Ronin Burger ($10.00) - Portuguese Donuts with Coffee Gelato - Mandarin Orange Tangerine Soda - The Katsushiro  Our party of 11 arrived around 1:30pm on a Monday. The restaurant was about half full, but there was no space large enough for our group. We waited about 20-30 minutes before a table was cleared. Since we had to wait for a table we already knew what we wanted to order when we were sat.  Our server was pretty nice and relatively attentive.   The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries with garlic aioli and fried egg was delicious! The chili was pretty tasty and I loved the fresh cilantro and jalapeno slices the fries were garnished with. The portion is pretty big so sharing this is a good idea. The other fries were also pretty good, nothing particularly outstanding, but good enough.  I decided to go with the Kalibi Burger (Angus beef, kalbi marinade, house made kimchi, green onions, and ko chu jang mayo) because I love Korean food and Korean flavors. This burger was delicious. I asked for my burger medium, and while it was a little more of a medium rare, it was well seasoned and juicy. The house made kimchi was pretty good and the ko chu jang mayo was tasty, too. The burger also came with a little side of kimchi style cucumbers, which were delicious. I would totally get this again.  Two of my friends decided to go with the Shogun Burger (Waygu beef, unagi, poached asian pear, pan seared foie gras, miso butter, yamamomo peach). This was delicious, and it better be for $25. All the flavors married really well together and made this burger really tasty. Both who ordered it were very satisfied. I had a bite of the Ronin Burger (Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ, yuzu citrus aioli), which was pretty tasty, as was Kiki's Burger (Angus beef, sauteed shiitake, enoki and eryngi mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli), which was also pretty tasty.  For dessert we ordered the Portuguese Donuts with Coffee Gelato after seeing a picture of it posted at the entrance of the restaurant. I think it looked better in the picture than it tasted. The donuts were a little doughy and dense. I liked the coffee gelato, but I mean, it was coffee gelato.   The Mandarin Orange Tangerine Soda was pretty tasty. The Katsushiro (alcoholic) was also pretty good, according to the bachelorette.   Overall, I thought Bachi Burger was pretty tasty. I'd definitely come back here for a burger.",

    "text": "This isn't the great Bachi burger that we all remember. It's completely changed in terms of service and quality of food served. It's very sad because I've visited 3x over the last year and half and it's been the same poor service and quality each time. I'm completely heartbroken over this because I always used to bring guests Bachi Burger. I honestly won't ever come back again. The evening began with getting seated in the ramen room. They were cooking something like onion or something spicy. Everyone seated in the room was literally in tears from whatever they were cooking.  Server brought some of our drinks then just disappeared. The meal was as follows: garlic edamame with no flavor. We sent them back. She had them remade but they came out with so much salt that we were cringing while eating them. Both batches were the same. We didn't bother sending them back because it wasn't worth the hassle. We asked for our fries and burgers to come out at the same time. Our fries came out 10 minutes before and were cold. The burgers finally came out and were  just warm. The eggs in two of our burgers were overcooked. The other person helping the waiter brought our desserts WHILE WE WERE STILL EATING.  it was the most bizarre thing ever. We told them to take them back until we were done. Finally when we ask for the desserts again, we asked for a candle. The waiter said they were out of candles and they didn't sing happy birthday . Okay fine, that's not a huge deal. It's a bit weird, but i won't hold that against them. The food, however,  was bad as was the service. It honestly pains me to write this because I truly loved Bachi burger, but this is the 3rd time we have had bad service and bad food so I feel it's my responsibility to let people know that Bachi Burger is no longer a good place to eat...",

My husband and I started with the chili fries with the oxtail. OMG. Like OMG. We both had the Shogun Burger. It was like angels sang and wept. THE BEST! The manager came by later and we told her how much we loved the burger. She said a lot of Californians come in and are enraptured by it.  It's a hipster kinda place with Japanese influence but don't let that scare you off.",

We had the oxtail fries (definitely a highly recommend), spicy miso burger (one of the most delicious burgers I have ever had), and than my friend has the crusty crab (also pretty decent).   About the service, waitress asked of we had any allergies that they should know about. I do not have any, but this is the first time I was ever asked this question. It is a very considerate question to ask. Also, when my friend and I provided our credit cards to pay she asked for our IDs!? It is the little things that count. In a world so full of identity theft I really appreciated this question.   Amazing food and service. This location is kind of far from my house, but I will be visiting the closer one more frequently now!",

The burgers that they highlighted on that episode were nothing short of remarkable in terms of their creativity and I could practically see the flavors jumping out of the screen and performing kabuki theater on my tasebuds.    Two of my favorite things - Asian Food and Burgers - combined into the same meal?  Sign me up!!  So, it practically goes without saying that my next trip through Vegas contained \"Bachi Burger\" at the top of my TO-DO list.  And I wasn't disappointed.  This place is incredible!  I've been here twice now and though I still have several of their burgers yet to try, my personal favorite has been the Kalbi Burger with Kimchee and the pork-belly steam buns.  Seriously some of the most flavorful creations I have ever encountered.  My friends had the Miagi San and the Black and Green Burgers and everyone was no less than amazed.  The creators of Bachi Burger have created a winner here.  I hope that their success continues so that I won't have to go all of the way to Vegas anytime that I want one of these Zen burgers.  Of course, for the time being, I'm more than willing - because they're worth it!",

    "text": "Came here with a party of 9 on a Saturday night. Previous comments were unhappy on the service but I think the owner listened because we were served in the 30 minutes they told us. They even came out to tell us the previous table has paid and just needs to pack their leftovers.  Food here was up to the hype. I am a big fan of burgers! I had their shogun burger, that's wagyu and unagi with seared foie gras... This burger melted in my mouth. I tasted the buttery foie gras and when I asked for medium, it came out medium so there was no hesitation there. The appetizers were good. I recommend the oxtail fries with an egg over. Truffle fries were good too but nothing extraordinary.   This will be one of the spots I will come back to everytime I'm here. See you in June for sure!",

Thank god we took his advice because the food was phenomenal! Oxtail fries are a must. The burgers were well cooked and artisanal, toppings did not really overpower and complimented everything very well. My next vegas trip, I'll definitely have to visit again! Also, beware this place gets busy. We arrived 30 minutes after they opened and there was a line of about 12 or so already formed.",

They've been open long enough to get their sh*t together. They just don't seem to be able to serve customers consistently. Sometimes it is fine, other visits can be a total disaster. You can experience MIA waiters, an abandoned check-in stand and delayed or confused orders.   The poor service really puts a damper on your dining experience and will make you forget how fun the food is. You have to be strategic about your dining times so you don't get lost in the chaos.",

These are a bit too gourmet for my taste but I can see why they are popular and I'd recommend for anyone to give this place a try!",

Why would you name your restaurant \"BAD LUCK BURGER\" what the hell, we eating bad luck for lunch?? hell NAW!!! thats bad for your body thats bad luck i want good luck all the time!! We were greeted by a grumpy old white man at the front and he sat us down and grumbled and mumbled some words under his stinky breath, I could smell the air comin out of his mouth hole, it was like cigarettes combined with a jar of pee pee left in the sun for 3 days! oo man oo man bam it made me so hungry! I think some of his dandruff fell into my water cause i looked into my glass and it looked like a snow-globe in there! it was very cute but i dont wanna drink old white dry skin flakes! thats nasty basty! everytime he walk by he would be talking to himself, i do that too, i usually say inspirational quotes to myself to get my mind through the day cause lately i been feeling depressed and down and i dont like it. so i recorded him with my android robot 4 phone and used the CSI voice analyzer app to hear what he was saying. turns out he was just saying the lyrics to the Jug Jug song by Jimmy Crabbits. i was let down yet again by this man. I ordered the fish burger and some garlic fries, the waitress then said well we dont have anymore garlic for the fries so ill just bring it out without the garlic, i was like HMM OK maybe shell discount us cause the MAIN INGREDIENT of the dish is not there, NOPE STILL FULL PRICE, BAD LUCK AGAIN AT BAD LUCK BURGER. while i waited for the food i went to the toilet, BAD LUCK AGAIN THE MANS TOILET WAS BROKE SO I GOTTA USE THE WOMAN TOILET NOW. i went in the woman toilet and dropped off a little brown bean child into the swimming pool and flushed it down the whirlpool. when i come out 3 women in line just looked at me like i was creepy AZIZ ANSORRY! BAD LUCK AGAIN, IM A OFFICIAL MEMBER OF THE BAD LUCK BURGER CLUB. i came back to my seat and my food was there, i ate it up and the burger was tasty! and the fries was like dry twigs you could make a campfire with by rubbing em together like tom hank in castaway! damn i love castaway! remember wilson?? i hope hes ok just floating in the ocean like that. when i was leaving i stubbed my big toe against the big toe of the old white man, he dropped 3 beers he was holding, another waitress slipped on the beer, slid across the restaurant floor like tom cruise in his undies and crashed into a family holding hands and saying their prayers before the meal !!! BAD. LUCK. BURGER.",

The milkshakes are worth the extra calories. The salted caramel toasted marshmallow was addicting!   Only getting 4 stars due to poor, inattentive service :(. And that they ran out of the top seller burger (bahmi) within an hour of opening. They didn't tell us until we ordered it. Am disappointed we couldn't try it",

    "text": "Saw this place on the Food Network last year... I go to Vegas every 2 months and something always comes up to distract me from going. Insisted we go this trip. Was it good? Hell yeah!! Was it epic? Nahhh. Pros: Great burger my goodness! Great menu... less is definitely more (on the menu)... good sign of a great food establishment.  Hate to see a 4 page menu of a bunch of silly stuff...ranging from chicken wings to liver and onions...geeeze... just give me the goods! Fresh ingredients! Ok a couple of us had the famous burgers...fried eggs 'n all. Wow! I had the spicy miso ramen. Enough for 2.. as authentic as you can get too... omg was it tasty. The \"regular\" spicy is perfect along with the \"house hot sauce. I think the \"extra spicy\" soup may have been a tad too hot for me. We tried the listed parmesan garlic fries,  and onion rings (not on menu) they were tasty!  The cons, hence the missing star: busy busy busy which can be a great sign, but it's too small. This place deserves a larger place, not sandwiched in a tiny corner strip mall connected to subway. Wait at 3pm (to me that should be an \"off time of day) was 45 minutes for 5 of us. Most tables are for 2, maybe a couple for 4. Prices were okay for appetizers.. too much for ramen and burgers.  Burgers were tasty as heck but on the smaller side..Come on people.. $18 for a bison burger? Sure in a cool location at a popular casino.. but not in a corner strip mall.  All In all great food. One tip.... move your rat trap from the front door by the trashcan... to another location. In the States this isn't a good sign.  *Revised Update: Just found out they were closed down for roaches or something. Sometimes I think they cant avoid it in a outdoor strip mall...Darn it, wanted to go one more time.  I believe there is another location somewhere!",

    "text": "My 500th review.... WOW. FIVE HUNNIDD. 5 hundred ones.  On my 2nd trip back to Vegas in as many weeks, I just had to have more of Bachi Burger. I met a grade school classmate who lives in town at the original location on Windmill. It was my first time at this location. It was just a little after 11am on a Friday. I had just landed at McCarran. From the airport, I got my rental car and drove the short distance to Bachi. I was seated right away being that they just opened. I was seated towards the back by the window on the way to the restrooms but still had full view of  the entire restaurant.   Waited a little while for my friend as she was in transit but stuck in traffic. The waiter we had made sure to check on me a couple of times and I started off with the oxtail cheese fries. It was served just in time as my friend sat down. Great timing!.. The oxtail chili cheese fries were as good as I remember. Perfectly crisp fries, tender strips of oxtail strewn about amongst cheese, chili (with beans), jalapeno slices & cilantro. Oh and dont forget the fried egg on top... Good stuff.  For my entree, I ordered the pork belly steamed buns (3 pieces) instead of a burger. It's just so tasty and perfect in its bite sized form. The soft & delicious still warm steamed bun, cradling the slightly crisp on the edges but buttery soft pork belly with hoisin sauce, sliced hard boiled egg & cilantro (i dont even like cilantro!) combination is so damn good. Its one of my most favorite cravings these days. Thankfully the Sawtelle location opened the same exact day I was at the OG location. I'm definitely going there to get my fix and to support my friend's cousin who is a line cook there.   My friend ordered the Miyagi-san burger with furikake, fried egg, chili mayonnaise, honey bacon and onion rings. It was good but the patty was overcooked to well done as my friend specifically ordered it medium-well. I also found it to be super sticky eating. Even the bun was kind of sticky. It could have been better.  Service was good, attentive. I thought the place could be a little cleaner. The windows I was sitting at needed some dusting and I didnt like seeing a couple of flies buzzing by the window blinds. Parking was plentiful because its in a shared lot with several other businesses. Bachi gets full in a hurry. Within a half hour of me being seated (11:15am) the place was packed...Shoku Ramen's (formerly next door) menu is served at Bachi Burger now, so the paper signs say. Thank you Bachi Burger but I think I like the Summerlin location better. You know what they say about first loves... They  never die. And Summerlin won me over at first bite.",

    "text": "I had High Expectations for this place. Been wanting to try them since their episode on Diners Drive Ins and Dives...  I came here for one thing, the Pork Belly!. I am from San Francisco where chinese food such as Peking Duck, Pork Buns etc. are in abundancre. However, I couldn't wait to try the Pork Belly at Bachi's. So? the Pork Belly Bao's are just oka6y. I imagined them tasting sooo much better from watching the episode on Diners. The actual chinese steam bun was not hot or even warm, they were cold. The worst part of a cold bun is that when a chinese steam bun gets cold it firms up, so the warm and soft texture of the bun is no longer. Also, the pork belly was not executed well. In the Diners episode it shows they dredge the pork belly lighly in corn starch then deep fry to give a suttle crunch texture, then they pan sautee it with the actual pork belly marinade. This clearly was not the case when we dined there. The pork looked as if it was only tossed in a pan with some oil.   The Ox Tails fries sound better than they actually taste. Literally there is no taste distinction that will cause you to identify actual Ox Tail in the chilli. It could be turkey for all I know. Literally tastes like your traditional chilli, with their asian inspired mayo over it. Not much fusion here.  Miyagi burger was actually good. The burger was executed nicely and all the flavors were on point. I hate to say it, it also took about a solid 7 minutes for us to even get some service to our table. And the worst part was there was only 2 other tables being served in the entire resturaunt at that time.   I would rate both Food & Service a 6.5 out of 10 across the board!   Unfortunately, I probably wont be dining here again. $98 for a meal that I waited for, for years just to be left unsatisfied.",

Those things are nuts...it's sweet and spicy and meaty and cheesy. Everything you could ever need to make your taste buds dance! It's a huge portion too. We split it between 3 people and were stuffed before our burgs even came out.   I don't recall the name of the burger I got but it was one of their popular ones with onion strings, fried egg, and ca realized bacon. Oh that bacon! So good. They cooked it medium rare perfectly, which I always appreciate. It was super juicy when I cut into it. In all honesty though, it didn't have a ton of flavor. I thought the spicy mayo would come through more. The bacon was the best part. And the bun was super good too. Really fluffy and slightly sweet.   Definitely a place to try! Everything's got a bit of a Japanese twist so it's interesting.",

    "text": "So we arrived to vegas a bit late and craved burgers. I've heard good things about bachi burgers and the pictures have always made me drool. Finally we got to try it and I wasn't disappointed!  I'm not sure why so many people had such bad service, but we must've came on a good night. The service was great for us and the guy was really funny.   Truffle Parmesan Fries - Definitely loaded w/ black truffle flavor! It was enough to share between the 4 of us. Nice and crispy, not oily at all  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - Their most popular item, presented beautifully! The over easy egg on top made everything delicious. Again, fries were cooked perfectly crispy, but I do wish they added more oxtail. Not that the fries were bad, but I actually prefer the truffle fries.  Shogun Burger - $25 for a burger?! My bf ordered this and I got to steal 1/4 of it. It sounded like the ultimate most delicious burger ever w/ all the ingredients listed: wagyu beef, unagi, pan seared foie gras, miso butter, peach YUMM. Unfortunately though the flavors were all lost in translation to me. The only thing I could taste the whole time was the unagi...This burger isn't worth $25 imo  Kiki burger - I love shrooms! (I know it's vegas, but I'm talking about food here people not the other kind of shroom lol) There were 3 kinds of mushrooms in this burger: shiitake, enoki, and eryngii. Instead of angus beef, I paid extra to get the wagyu beef patty. The caramelized bacon and mushrooms made the burger stand out. This was my 2nd favorite burger  Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu Burger - My 2nd favorite burger!! Again, that fried egg w/ the oozing yolk made this burger taste its best. The crispy onions & furikake added the extra oomph to it. For first timers I would recommend getting this to start!  Spicy Miso burger - It's not spicy at all. The burger wasn't bad, but flavors didn't pop or stand out compared to Kiki & Miyagi-San.  The patties here were all requested to be cooked medium rare and they came out good/juicy. I really like the taiwanese sweet buns here which makes the burgers unique. However, after trying Gordon Ramsay's BurGR in PH, I believe the burgers there are a lot better. I wouldn't mind coming back though next time I'm in vegas and craving asian fusion burgers",

The food is absolutely delicious and heavy. We started out with ox tail french fries and pork belly steamed buns. The ox tail portion resembled more like sauce filled with shreds of ox meat blended in there to give it the goopy texture. I've never had ox tail like this and I'd highly recommend this item if this was the only time you could go here.   I ordered the Kiki burger and despite not being hungry, finished the entire patty and the contents inside. The buns were only for my visual pleasure. The patty was a heavy Angus beef  with sauteed mushrooms, caramelized bacon, onion marmalade, gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli. And when I say, heavy, you can feel the weight drop on your hand.  On the scale of gourmet burgers, it ranks very high. For its price, you get the comparable weight of two Big Macs. I may not appreciate that as much, but boy, was it delicious.",

And they will use that to their advantage.  The hostess really knows how to make your experience a shitty one. No smiles, very stern voice, and absolutely no common sense. We had to wait next to an empty table for 4 for about 30 min while she was \"building a table\" for a bigger party. There was no, \"Sorry for the wait\" or \"Thanks for your patience\". But once you get past her incompetence, it's smooth sailing from there.  Food is great, you MUST order the oxtail chili fries. That is the only reason I will put up with the crappy hostess. I've tried most of the burgers and they have all been mouth watering. The best part is that each burger will come with their own little surprise that will have you asking, \"Excuse me, what is this, and what is it for?\" You'll understand when you see it.",

    "text": "Y U M M Y!!!! Their burgers are juicy, succulent, and absolutely original!! We started off with:  Oxtail fries: This is more like chili fries with oxtail bits in it...to be honest I wasn't a huge fan. Plain unseasoned fries with chili and dry bits of meat...ehhhhh it's okay. I would rather go for regular fries next time.  Sweet potato fries (garlic truffle): I've never tried garlic truffle SWEET potato fries before...so it was interesting. I think I prefer the garlic truffle on normal fries, but it was a good experience. Regardless, the fries were cooked well and overall well received.  I can't really go over all the burgers, but everyone loved their burger and I could see messy juices running down chins and onto tables...banh mi burger and Mr. Ho are some MUST TRYs. If you have a smaller appetite, then go for the steamed buns. There are 3 dinky little buns that still taste great, but like I said...just smaller portion (definitely not for Hungry Hippo Me, but to each their own).   I can't wait to come back during my next Vegas trip and try more of their delicious burgers! DEFINITELY a must have!",

We have only been to this location and every time we have the best experience. The customer service is great and the food is top quality! We always put in at LEAST 2 orders of the pork belly steamed buns (bao). Yesterday, I tried the black garlic Tonkostu ramen. They have a separate ramen menu. Anyways, the ramen was amazing of course. We always leave happy and full whenever we come here. It's always a special treat that we look forward to.

    "text": "DISAPPOINTING BURGER EXPERIENCE My group was waffling between Gordon Ramsey's BurGR and Bachi Burger.  Having been to BurGR, we decided to give Bachi Burger a try.  However, this was a HUGE disappointment.  We started our experience with the often-raved oxtail fries.  Although they were tasty, the fries were not crisp and were \"eh.\"  [Not certain if the oil was old or exactly why the potatoes were borderline soggy other than the chili on top of it.]  The taste was good, but if the fries were actually crispy, it would've been great.  My friend ordered a chocolate and peanut butter shake.  As shake consumers, we LOVE shakes.  However, this one lacked flavor.  In fact, you could barely taste both the chocolate and peanut butter.  [My friend barely sipped her shake so I sampled it wondering why it was almost untouched.]  As for the burgers - the main attraction - we shared two different burgers:   Kim Chee burger and Kiki's burger.  The Kim Chee burger was plain and was essentially kim chee and jalapenos thrown onto the burger.  Kiki's was tasty with carmelized onions and the and gruyere cheese, however, there was a sauce - korean mayo? - that did not pair with the burger taste.  I will say that the hamburger buns are fantastic, but that's about it.  If you are into burgers, I would suggest that you journey to Gordon Ramsey's BurGR.  You will not be disappointed by their menu, food quality and taste.  Bachi was okay, but certainly not at those prices for ala carte burgers.  Even In and Out burgers are more satisfying and at only a fraction of the cost and time.  DON'T GO OUT OF YOUR WAY!!!",

Asking my local friends about where to eat, they all recommended this one. Theres another location in LV, but this was closer to our destination. I think it was a weekend, so we had to wait about 45~ minutes. I wished there was a bigger waiting area, its only a little nook near the entrance.  Once seated, we were assisted right away, which is a plus in my book. We decided to check out some of the fries as appetizers. Specifically, we got an order of Ox Tail Fries and Truffle Parmesan. The Truffle Parm fries were good, but if you needed to try something, you gotta go for the Ox Tail ones. Imagine chili cheese fries, but super duper upscaled. The meat is super tender. I'd probably get an order to myself when I go again!  For the main course, I ordered the Miyagi Sans Burger. Its like an upscaled version of a western cheeseburger. Grassfed Beef, onion rings, and an egg! It was sooooooo good. They have a lengthy menu, that I would love to try more and more.  Definitely check them out! Theres a burger for anyone!",

I've also tried a bit of the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Burger and the Spicy Miso burger which were both perfectly packed with flavor. The beef itself were also juicy and always cooked to perfection.   The only burger I did not like was the Black & Green Burger. It sounds good on paper - spinach, blue cheese, bacon, and mushrooms - but I think the mushrooms overpowered the burger way too much and left me with a weird taste. I was pretty disappointed with it.   The Oxtail Fries are a must! It's a great appetizer to share. The Sweet Potato fries are also really good as well and come with a delicious yuzu citrus aioli sauce. The Truffle Parmesan fries were good too but it has some sort of gravy (it's called black truffle porcini cream in the menu) that some of my friends didn't like.   All in all, there's so many options to choose from and most of the time it will leave you with a happy tummy! Bachi Burger is definitely worth a try!",

I ordered the Ronin Burger,  and it was Dee-lish! I enjoyed everything that was on that bad a## burger! The Oxtail Chili fries were the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>, and the Truffle Parmesean fries were good, but not as good as the Oxtail in my opinion. I would recommend going if you want to try a burger done differently, exploding with different flavors inside your mouth :-)",

I brought my Grandma/pa so that he can eat a burger and my Asian grandmother can have ramen (perfect, or so i thought). Ordered, ramen for her, a burger for me and pops, 2 fries, and a milk shake. Ramen comes out in normal 12-14 minute time frame. Milkshake comes out next 8-10 minutes later. 15-18 minutes from there (yes, over a half hour and 70% through her ramen our burgers come out. And how about another 10 minutes for our fries when i was taking my last 2 bites of my burger. What the hell?! No updates from the waitress, no apology or even explanation for the delays or for our meal coming out deconstructed. We asked for no lettuce on one of the burgers and it still came out with it on. I simply do not understand! Its simple... other restaurants can handle a simple burger with NO LETTUCE, why cant you? You did it six years ago when we asked for no onions. AMAZING!   People make the comment that it takes time to make a good burger. I may be ok with that if you can at least bring out the meal so we can eat TOGETHER. And maybe get the order correct at LEAST. Part of the dining experience is service, and Bachi fails at this and has not attempted to remedy it since they opened years ago.",

    "text": "Bottomline:  Food is inconsistent, wait times are ridiculous, and service was painfully slow, yet kind.  I have been following this place for awhile now but I've never gotten a chance to try it until now.  We had a party of 9 and waited an hour for our table...even though they could have pushed together a couple of tables.  What's worse was that our food took another 45 minutes to arrive.  Kitchen was backed up like a constipated monster.   Here's a breakdown of the food:  Oxtail fries - Woooahh there.  They need to ease up on the sugar in this \"chili\" oxtail sauce because it was as sweet as Kate Upton's Dougie.  The fries came out nice and crisp however.  Truffle Parmesan fries - These were pretty good but they should really call it a poutine instead.  The brown gravy on it was amazingly tasty but...where is the truffle flavor? The dipping sauce they give you was good...but it's just mayo and sirracha.   Miso Burger with extra patty - I ordered medium rare and it came out perfect.  The juice was flowing and the sauce was tasty.  Miyagi Burger - Ordered medium on this guy and it came out well done.  Should have sent this back because it was almost inedible.  How can you possibly overcook a burger this much? FAIL.  The waitress asked us if we wanted dessert and we all replied with a quick no...we really didn't feel like waiting another hour for our food.  To sum it up, the food is decently priced because the burgers are huge and are very tasty...IF cooked properly.  Service was S-L-O-W, from the waitstaff to the waiters to the kitchen.  3 SLOW stars.",

Our favorites are the Shogun (with foie gras!) and perfectly seasoned Banh Mi burger. Also go for the Ox tail chili fries and the Pork belly buns.  What impressed us more during our last visit is that they've expanded their menu. Must try are the North Shore Shrimp Truck (if you've ever been to Oahu and tried the shrimp trucks, you will know what this is about) and the Bone marrow jam (long bone cut longitudinally in half for you to scrape out the marrow's fatty goodness).   Just so happy with this place. So many things to enjoy on the menu. Haven't even mentioned ramen menu from Shoku Ramen Ya which used to have its own entrance.",

Chili garlic wings -  the wings are crunchy, however the girl told us that they ran out of sauce; not impressed at all.   They should have let the customers know ahead of time if they are ran out of certain item not until you brought it out.   What can we do at that time?   Anyhow,  Kevin was nice enough to offered us different dipping sauce.  3.  Kiki burger -  the meat was tender,  a good choice to try out.  4.  Spicy Miso burger -  meat was good and savory but not spicy at all. 5. Kalbi burger -  my daughter loved it but too kimchi on it which making the buns to soggy.  6. Miso -  too salty; nothing special with it.  Overall,  if we're coming back to Vegas, we will definitely give it a try again.",

We started off w/ the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries based on all the awesome pics on Yelp, & these were soo delicious! The tender oxtail, chili & cheese oozing over the crispy thin fries w/chopped green onions,cilantro & spicy little kick of jalapenos on top was yummy. The chili wasn't overpowering so that was a plus for me. Definitely recommend trying!  For my main entree, I decided to order the kalbi burger. I love korean food, so this was the perfect burger for me w/ the kalbi marinade&kimchee. Boy oh boy, I'm drooling thinking abt it! The bun was soft, the meat was cooked medium rare like I had asked, the kalbi marinade was absolutely flavorful&sweet, & the kimchee altogether added a nice crunch.  Overall, awesome first experience as the food did not disappoint. Really cool concept w/ the Asian-fusion food. Def recommend checking this place out!!",

Truffle Parmesean fries - below average  - I would've given this an average rating but I couldn't taste the truffle at all.  The dipping sauce it comes w/ is delicious tho.  Oxtail Chili Cheese fries w/ fried egg - below average - The chili was waaaaaaaay too sweet.  I couldn't put my finger on it but I've never tasted sweet chili before.  Wasn't a big fan.  The presentation of this dish is beautiful but it didn't live up to the hype.  Miyagi San Grass Wagyu Fed Burger ($10) - Slightly above average.  The shrimp tempura inside the burger was a nice touch, & gave it a nice crunchy feel.   They over-cooked my burger tho.  I ordered medium rare and it came out medium; almost felt like I was eating an in-n-out burger or something.  Kiki Burger ($10) -above average.  I dug the garlic, onions, bacon, & mushrooms.  It's a solid burger.  Basic, but solid.  Tips: -Service sucks beyond belief.      -They had our table set up but didn't seat us till 10 minutes after the table was ready.    -Food took about 30-40 minutes to come out after placing the order    -I ordered some extra sides of sauce and they never brought it  -Food is gonna be messy.  I tried the Miso burger (also pretty good) and there were piles of sauce everywhere; this isn't an insult to the dish mind you, the burger itself was still pretty good.  The food is good and prices are pretty cheap, offset by horrible service.  3 stars.",

Last night was my final attempt. Me and my boyfriend arrived and waited at the \"please wait to be seated\" sign for about 10 minutes, about 5 minutes in the guy that was waiting in front of us left, I guess he'd waited too long too. We waited another 5 minutes (the whole time staff buzzing by and looking at us but avoiding eye contact). Someone finally asked if we had been helped to which we replied no.  They took our name and said it would be just a few minutes. Keep in mind we could plainly see 3 or 4 open and set tables ready to go. We sat down and waited another 15 minutes.... and then left. I will never try to eat here again.",

Maybe I had too much of a high expectation, perhaps?   We shared the oxtail fries, which is a highly recommended item on their menu. It was okay, it honestly just tasted like spicy chili fries, and I couldn't really taste the oxtail at all (bummer)  Burgers were decent, good flavors, a little messy and hard to eat though. I believe this place is an Asian inspired burger joint so the flavors and seasoning threw me off a little. Clean and nice restaurant, the staff was pretty nice. Might come back and give it another try in the future. Down fall is that this place is off the strip.",

    "text": "FINALLY!!! After seeing this yummy burger spot featured so many times on Food Network & Cooking Channel shows I finally got to experience it...TWICE in one weekend! :D  I wasn't planning on eating a \"dirty\" meal our first night we got to Vegas since I wanted to still look somewhat lean for the Olympia Expo (cuz everybody that attends that convention and show is just shredded to the max and I can't go in lookin' like a flabby chump) but I ended up fasting for over 22 hours and I needed a place to eat STAT! So I ended up here, at Bachi, alone since the SBBF had his own team dinner to attend.  I didn't have to wait long to be seated even during their busiest dinner hour (7-8pm). Once I was seated I knew exactly what I wanted for my appetizer to start, the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries of course! I love the fact that the table of 6 seated right next to me ordered the same appetizer, but for their entire table. And I loved it even more when my fries came out and I literally devoured that ish like a BEAST and I could tell that party of 6 were either horrified watching, or completely entertained. As I was scarfing these fries down I could taste every bit of authentic flavor to this dish. OMFG! Seriously the best of the best chili cheese fries I've ever had! I love how crispy these fries were and the oxtail flavor was just orgasmic. The raw jalapenos mixed in with the garlic aioli was heavenly. And the final cherry on top to this dish, that fried egg...omg, as I broke into that egg and it seeped down through all the fries, I seriously was jizzing all up in my panties right then and there!  Now onto the burger! I ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger which came with the most delicious beef patty, chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon and crispy onion rings. The bun itself had the right crunch and chewiness to it. I enjoyed every bit of this burger. Thanks Kristi (my waitress) for the recommendation!  **The following night...around 11:30pm we returned to Bachi! Technically, I returned here and just brought the SBBF along.**  Appetizers:  1) Truffle Parmesan Fries with parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream slathered all over it with a sun dried tomato aioli as the dip. The fries were delish! That black truffle cream hit the spot for these fries. There's really no need to even dip into the aioli because I felt it took away from that black truffle flavor on the fries. 2) Sweet Potato Fries dusted with sea salt and a yuzu citrus aioli for the dip. You can honestly never go wrong with sweet potato anything! These were bomb diggity, end of story.  Burger: I went for the Kalbi Burger this time with angus beef, kalbi marinade, green onions, house made KIM CHEE and a ko chu jang mayo. I think because of the fact that I'm a kim chee whore, this burger totally topped the burger I had the night before. OMG! Flavor was just amazeballs! And the pickled cucumbers that came on a little side dish was heavenly! Mmmmmmmm baby!  I also ordered their hot Japanese matcha green tea both times I came here. You get free refills with their teas and it was delicious.   Service is top notch here. They are very attentive and efficient. I'm definitely returning to Bachi the next time we're in Vegas. It's a f*ckin must I tell ya!",

All food was not hot and 'fresh' ... probably sat by expediter longer than it took us to eat it. Honestly one of the worst experiences. They even asked if it was our first time, which it was. You would think they would go the extra mile to make us like them. Instead, they slouch walked the restaurant floor barely smiling.   For the prices, I was expecting more, especially since it's competitive with Las Vegas strip prices. Instead, the flavors were that of a poser. Very unsatisfied with all we ordered.   When the bill came, they put at the bottom of the receipt how much gratuity to give. Tip should be estimated before taxes, not after. Needless to say, but they got less than what they 'asked' for.  Not coming back.",

Maybe it was all the hype and build up, but the experience was underwhelming (think I once had a lover say the same thing about me, but that's neither here nor there. what?).  The Miyagi-san burger came out perfectly cooked, but it wasn't anything to jump for Jesus over. The truffle fries...man I do not know what to make of those. They seemed soggy and the truffle sauce tasted like gravy. Expensive gravy.  Making matters worse wss that the service was bad, and I really hate saying that because any service industry position can be a real pain when dealing with the public. That being said, the server seemed rather disinterested and only stopped by to take the order and bring the bill (no refills or checking in to see how average the food was); it wasn't halfway full, either, and they appeared quite well staffed. Could've gotten her on a bad day, I suppose.  Overrall, if you're looking for an overhyped burger delivered with unenthusiastic bristle, this is the place!",

    "text": "I am always hesitant to drive somewhere to eat off of the beaten path when vacationing in Las Vegas because there are so many great places on the strip.  I was brought to Bachi Burger as a place we had to try, and the food did not disappoint.    My first impression was that of skepticism since it is in a strip mall with not too much else around.  The looks of the place are pretty underwhelming when leaving the glamour and all the lights to the dusty roads of the dessert, but the food was definitely worthy of the visit.  I ordered the Kalbi burger, with no mayo, and fries. The burger had an excellent flavor that was on the sweet side. It actually tasted like what I thought it would judging by the picture and the ingredients.  It definitely satisfied my burger craving.  The fries were regular, but they came with pineapple ketchup.  That also tasted like what I hoped for.  It had a mild pineapple flavor that was not too overpowering.  It was a very tasty meal overall.  I am never too keen on leaving the strip when visiting Las Vegas, but Bachi Burger was worth the drive.  There are a couple of burger places in Vegas that I prefer, but they have unique burgers and ingredients here that make it worth a visit.",

It was good, but not $30 dollar good.  The burger itself was on the sweeter side (good or bad depending on your preference), a bit sloppy due to the sheer size of it and its layers, but I did not enjoy the soggy buns.    Unfortunately, the poor service I received here overshadowed the food experience.  I understand restaurants get busy, but there really isn't an excuse for excessive waits and horribly bad service.  1)excessive wait to order drinks after we're sat(who is our server?) 2)wait an absurd amount of time for drinks  3)wait more to order food because drinks were brought by someone else (where is our server?) 4)appetizers finally come out after a long wait, but more annoyingly, having some appetizers come after the main dish because it was forgotten(really?)  To top it off, receiving the wrong bill after the poor service was completely aggravating.  Of course we had to wait for our lost server to come back and tell us :)",

My gf had gotten a couple people to recommend this place to her and she saw it on Diners Drive ins and Dives which convinced her to have to check it out. The place is a bit strange as it is combined with a ramen place next door, never really seen that before but it didn't conflict with my experience. We started with the oxtail chili cheese fries, wow were they great! A ton of delicious cheese and chili on top of thin cut fries. The meat and Asian jalapeno peppers gave it a nice kick as well. For my entree I decided to go with the Kiki burger. I decided to get the sweet onion marmalade on the side since I was a bit skeptical and I'm glad I did as it did not compliment the burger at all in my point of view. The meat was a bit more well done than I hoped but good none the less. The mushrooms really made the burger, great flavor and a good amount of them in the burger. Overall I had a good experience here and the price and wait time was fair. I recommend it!",

However, the severe downside to Bachi Burger is the physical establishment itself. God awful, repulsive, marketing focus group chosen music played at ear-splittingly abhorrent volumes, sure to prevent you from speaking to any fellow patron more than one and a half feet away. Sitting down and eating at Bacchi Burger is a contest between your impulse to enjoy your admittedly excellent tasting meal slowly and your other impulse to escape ASAP. The gruff and oftentimes unhelpful waiters and waitresses greatest ease is to inform you that a seating area is closed (for no apparent reason) and  greatest displeasure is to give you the time of day or, god forbid, return a polite smile.  The best way to enjoy Bachi Burger is to mercifully spare yourself the trip and order via UberEats, which, all things considered, is the godsend in all of this.",

The Loco Moco burger is my favorite. It's bunless and served on risotto. We haven't tried their ramen yet, but it always looks amazing. Definitely one of my favorite burger places ever.",

My favorite thing was the bun, extremely soft and a nice change from a regular hamburger bun. My only gripe is that the burgers come a la carte. Fries and an additional charge. Good burger but for the price you can find a better one that includes a side of fries.",

From the main street, it looked like the place was closed because there was a screened patio and no one was sitting there.  When we came by the front and entered we realized it was certainly NOT closed.  Place was pretty full on a Friday afternoon.  We were fortunate to get a seat.  From reading so many reviews, I opted for the Miyagi-San burger (requested medium) and a side of truffle fries.  My husband decided to order off their Shoya ramen menu.    The burger came, excitement level 9000!  It tasted...good.  But I was severely disappointed that they overcooked my burger!  It was medium well.  No ways around it.  I really feel it being overcooked distracted me from what would otherwise be very delicious flavors.  The Truffle Parmesan fries were good.  The black truffle porcini cream was very tasty.  I wished it had more.  I really didn't taste much of the parmesan however.  The sun dried tomato aioli was forgettable.  Overall, I may have overhyped the place for myself as I left feeling a bit disappointed.",

    "text": "This was my second time here and I was honestly not very impressed. I felt that my disappointment stemmed from the high expectations that I had for the food and that it was not what I expected.  I have heard about this place from many of my foodie friends who rave about their oxtail fries and burgers. I went a few years back and tried one of their other gourmet fries which was not oxtail fries and that was utterly delicious to me. So upon returning I was determined to try the fries. Being Jamaican I grew up eating amazing oxtail and it is actually one out of two of my favorite foods, fries being the other one. So I came back and ordered the dish and the miyagi burger. The fries are served in a huge portion that you can split with 3-4 people. When I tried it, I didn't even recognize the oxtail, it tasted like chili. It really didn't meet the hype that I've heard about it. The burger on the other hand was really good, but I felt that I've had gourmet burgers like this before and that it was whatever to me. I just really was not impressed with the caliber and taste of their dishes.   In terms of service, the waiter was helpful and we did not have to wait long for a table. I felt that they weren't as attentive especially when we were looking for our checks. The restaurant has a very modern and clean look to it. We were put in a separate room because it was a big party of us. I felt that we were very separate from everyone else so I don't think I got a good feel of the entire restaurant. But from my perspective, there were a lot of people there yet it was not cramped at all.   All in all, I do want to give this place another chance. This time I will not have such high expectations and see if I can find the fries that I enjoyed before.",

Kiki burger has juicy angus beef, sauteed Japanese mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and a yummy sweet chili aioli!! Yum! This burger and aioli go so well together.  The buns they use for their burgers are so soft.    It's also great that they joined the menu of Shoku Ramen next door.  So your gourmet burger and ramen craving can be satisfied all at one place!  Servings of ramen are big! Very filling.    Tried the Portuguese donuts for dessert.  Very dense donut though.  Raspberry sauce on the side was great along with the coffee ice cream.    Definitely one of my fave burger joints.",

Last start with the service. She was in training and did a solid job. She gets full stars.  We ordered the Brussel Sprouts as an appetizer. The flavor was fantastic, but he sprouts needed about 2-3 more minutes steaming. They where very hard. 2 stars for this.   Then we ordered the Kiki Burger (wife) and I got the Bhan Mi Burger. Her medium cooked burger was way pink inside. Not medium at all. That was the only problem with hers. My burger was Med Rare and absolutely AWESOME! Seriously one of my top 3 burgers of all time. 3.5 stars for her and a solid 5 stars for me.   The truffle fries, well they sucked. Hard and flavorless unless you soaked them in sauce. 1 star at best.   All in all I'd say it was a 3.75 stars. I will without a doubt be back for another Bhan Mi Burger next time I'm in Vegas.",

So time wasn't completely wasted. We were sat down and drink orders were taken. After 10 wonderful minutes the waitress informs me with great news that they have ran out of my beer (bluemoon) then she suggested the horchata bluemoon (wtf), needless to say I just ordered an Arrogant Bastard. Later on that night we were served our burgers which actually weren't that bad until I noticed my burger was slightly undercooked. After delightful banter with my friends and great stories from the good ol days we parted ways. As soon as I got home I knew there was a problem. My intestines felt like there were twisted in ways only a toddler scribble on a chalk board could begin to describe. All I could think about was that evil burger and the pain it has caused me. Turns out my friend also got sick. I think a visit from the health department would be a nice treat for them. So if you really don't like somebody just recommend they eat there.

Inside and out burgers had similar burgers for much less price and better tasting too!   If you want to spend $ 22 dollars for a burger and fries, your better off going to BURGER BAR - LAS VEGAS @ Mandalay Place  100 times better than Bachi's",

    "text": "This is in my 'hood and I came in really wanting to be WOW'd by the place. But what I didn't expect was a walk down memory lane.  Service 101 memory lane.  1) Always greet the customer when they enter the restaurant. Bachi Burger could really embrace the hipness of the restaurant by shouting out \"Hello\" or \"Goodbye\" when people enter and leave the restaurant. Choose a language. Shout a burger name. Something. BUT DO NO LEAVE THE CUSTOMER STANDING AT THE DOOR UNSURE OF SEATING THEMSELVES OR WAITING.  What's sad is that there weren't *busy* at the time and even the manager who was by the door didn't greet me. He was busy making change for someone at the register. I know y'all can multitask and look up for a split second to smile and say, \"Hello! We'll be right with you!\"  2) Bus the tables, immediately. It's gross to walk into a restaurant when there's a bunch of dirty tables. Again... the restaurant wasn't busy. In fact the waiter told me, \"Whew! we just got through with the busiest night!\"  Great. But just because I came at the end of the rush doesn't mean I should have to sit in a dining room of dirty glassware and dirty tables.   When I was showed to my table, the waiter paused at 2 tables before deciding the 3rd table was the winner. I had to laugh out loud because it seemed so disorganized to me. I think he mistook my laughter and explained the other tables hadn't been wiped down. He was very sweet and the poor guy tried to explain his way out of not greeting me and the dirty tables.  What really got me was that the waitstaff physically expressed their tiredness from the rush by leaning on tables, stretching in the dining room and squatting to stretch their legs. Hey gang. Do that in the kitchen where the customer can't see you. Better yet, get a move on and get the dining room cleaned up.  3) Know the menu. I've never been here so when I ask the waiter what do you recommend and you look at me blankly and say the burgers.... you've totally lost points with me. BURGER is in the name of the restaurant. I KNOW the burgers are supposed to be good. But which one? Why? What's in it? What's your favorite? You're the freakin' expert. You got trained, right?  4) Don't sweep the floor in front of me when I'm eating. We're not at McDonald's.   5) Be attentive to your tables and the ones around you. If you're going to help a fellow waiter out, KNOW WHERE THE GUESTS are in their meal. I had a waiter try to take the plates I was eating from three separate times. Really? I'M STILL EATING. You're cute and sweet but go away!  Learn to read the table. You don't have to come ask me every 5 minutes if I'm okay. You can tell if I'm okay by walking by the table and observing. If I make eye contact and LOOK like I need you, THEN come over.  6) Sense of urgency. Yeah, the rush may be over but there's still work to do. Watching a waiter mull around a dining room is unnerving. It's about as fun as walking into a store and watching the shop girls gossip with each other instead of servicing the customer and getting ready for more customers.  Finally... for the food.....  I had the Kurobuta sausage appetizer and the sausages were cooked perfectly with a slightly crisp skin that clicked as your teeth pierced through. I could have used more mustard though. The last 2 sausages were eaten dry because there wasn't any more mustard in the dish.  The truffle fries were good when the kitchen went heavier on the truffle the second try.   Pork belly steam buns were an unusual twist on the peking duck buns. The horseradish sauce was pretty good with it but I particularly liked dipping the sliced boiled egg in it.  What was most memorable to me was the cherry yuzu soda. I loved it. It was delicious. I'd come back just for the soda.  The potential to be great is totally here. Nice people work here. But they need better training. They don't realize they're doing anything wrong.  If I could see and taste past the service, the food is good. But once a guest has a sour taste in her mouth because of the service, it's hard to get past it.  I know these guys are new and working out the kinks. I really want to love this place so I'll come back in a month or so to see if the service has changed and when I do, I'll update this review.",

    "text": "Bachi Burger is a great place for hamburgers. The flavors are tasty and distinctive. The term gourmet hamburger is often over-used. I think anyone who aspires to make something better than a Big Mac will call it a gourmet burger. But the term really applies at Bachi Burger. It's first-rate ingredients prepared with great care, most with an Asian influence. I got the pickle plate appetizer, the mushroom cheeseburger, the salt-and-pepper fries and a soda they make in-house with cherry and some sort of Japanese fruit. As soon as the pickle plate comes you know the owner is a friend of foodies. There's little bites of six separate things, all quite interesting. My two favorites were the daikon radish and the garlic. The pepper in the salt-and0pepper fries are jalapenos. They're not too spicy. When the fries arrived they reminded me of a pepper-infused crab dish at Yummy Yummy in San Francisco. Interesting smells. And they tasted great. I got the pineapple ketchup o go with the fries but it didn't do much for me. The garlic aoili sauce was pretty good. The burger was great. The black angus beef was first rate and perfectly seasoned and cooked. I loved all the different mushrooms they put on the burger. The gruyere cheese was tasty. And the bun was good, too. Maybe the only disappointment was the soda. I was hoping for something with some zingy acidity to match the rich foods, but it was a little flat. I wished I had tried a lime soda instead. Bachi Burger is quite distinctive and certainly worth the trip south of The Strip., It's about 1.6 miles east of Interstate 15 at the Blue Diamond Road exit.",

Very interesting and well played, I'll have to say it's the best burger joint in Vegas, but also an expensive one.  The first burger I had wasn't that great, it had a gingery taste to it I think it was called the Ronin Burger.  But I gave it another chance and boy, it was amazing.  The Kalbi burger and The Kiki Burger are my favorites.  It's like an explosion of flavor in your mouth! The meat is cooked to my liking, never too well done.  If you do decide to get the Kalbi Burger, order an egg to it.  Trust me, it's delicious!",

    "text": "Let me just start this review out by saying I love burgers.  Although I enjoy eating salads and tons of veggies I can usually create a reason to go grab a burger at least once a week.  That being said when the opportunity to grab a burger people rave about pops up, I jump on it.  Now I don't want you to get the impression that I'm a burger snob, or a connoisseur of fine burgers.  I just love a great tasting burger that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Bachi Burger is that and a little more.  What sets this burger apart from other burger joints is its japaneezy flair. Each burger has a good amount of japanese zing that really differentiates itself from its all American counterparts.  One thing I would like to say is that usually when a restaurant decides to do a fusion/mashup theme there is a tendency to lose the first element in favor of the second.  For example it would be easy for a japanese fusion burger place to lose what makes a burger special so that they can cram in the japanese element.  A lot of times I've tried these fusion places only to find that they are only blending things together to be hip and cool not for flavor reasons.  I'm glad to say that when you bite into a Bachi Burger the japanese element is not overdone and you still get what makes a good burger a good burger.   I usually get the Ronin or the Kiki burger, as the first one has an egg (yes yes yes) and the second has my favorite ingredient (a ton of mushrooms).  Both burgers are great and are examples of fusion food done right.  All the elements of the Ronin blend together nicely and taste like a perfect balance of america and japanese cuisine, kind of like if the Fat Burger and Hamada's had a food baby.  The Kiki burger I feel was made for me  it has three kinds of japanese mushrooms Sauteed Shiitake, Enoki, and Eryngii Mushrooms (what! yes please).  Enoki mushrooms are a really under utilized mushroom and they are great!  I've been waiting for somebody to put them on a burger for a long time.  In fact if you put anything with Enoki mushrooms in front of me I will plow through it like a mad animal.   Bottom line if you're looking for a fusion restaurant that is about taste and not about gimmicks this is a great place.  The only reason I'm going to give them a four star rating is because when they used to be the only japanese fusion burger on the block they were the the top.  Now, however, I think that they have lost their crown to Fuku Burger both in terms of price and taste.  This might seem harsh, but I don't think you can ignore the fact that Fuku Burger came out swinging, and took the title of best japanese fusion burger away from Bachi.  Does this mean that you should go to Bachi Burger for your burger needs.... NO!! it's a damn fine burger, but it's like that 80's movie highlander taught us \"there can be only one\".",

    "text": "Our first time we were going to try Bachi Burger, there was a 30 min wait for lunch. So when we finally went back to try it, we were less than impressed . First, the guy who seated us seemed less than happy about having to seat us. Some people came in behind us and asked if we were all together, my husband said \"no,there's 2\". It took the server way too long to figure out that the other people would be a table of 4. As he was seating us, he was yelling at the bus girl about why there was a 6 top set up, pretty rude, all in all.   We got seated, then the people behind us got seated a couple minutes later, but somehow, the server went to greet those people first. Ok, but then it was another full 5-7 minutes before we were even approached. When Melissa finally came over, we were greeted by overly fake niceness. Never asked if we'd ever been there before, made any recommendations. She never asked if we wanted a drink to start, so we placed our order. We order the Bachi pickles, which are an APPETIZER, which usually means it comes FIRST. Nope, not at Bachi Burger, we got our fries and then our burgers and then asked if we still wanted the appetizer.  When we said no. Melissa asked if we were sure. The manager did come over and offered an explanation that there was a shift change going on and he offered his apology. Didn't actually say \"I'm sorry\" but said he wanted to offer his apology, which he never did.   When we got our meals, Melissa was kind enough to bring extra napkins. And then more napkins even though we never used the first set of extra napkins she brought us, I took this as an implication that maybe we were slobs, interesting, since we hadn't spilled a drop. Oh well.   Not a great experience. Bachi Burger was recommended to us by a friend and we saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and were looking forward to a burger experience. We didn't get anything more or special than we would have gotten at any other burger place. We've actually gotten better service and much less $$ burger joints. It was a \"been there, done that\" experience for us. Not one I'll look to repeat anytime soon.",

    "text": "Say this place on Triple D, everything looked great, so I knew I would have to try it the next time I was in Vegas. Was passing through over Spring Break and talked my wife into stopping in. Bad mistake.  Arrived around 5:30pm and about half the tables were seated. Had to wait 20 minutes to get a table anyway. The waiter was new and couldn't answer any questions about the menu. When we tried to ask another server, they refused to help, then went and sent our guy back to the table. It kind of became our joke for the night. We ordered beers from a so-so beer list, and they were out of that beer, ordered a different beer, out of it too. And then again. Finally asked the waiter to tell us what beers they did have, and it was only about half of the list. All of the interesting Japanese beers were not available. The rest was generic micro brews like Sam Adams, Stone Brewery, and Rouge, which they didn't have. Then we ordered dinner, a Kiki Burger MR, the Chili Chicken and the Truffle Parmesan Fries. The burger was barely cooked, maybe blood rare, but I ate it anyway. It was actually pretty good. I tried the Wagu beef to see if it really was better. It was tasty, but probably not worth the extra money.  The fries were bland and tasteless at best. Wouldn't order them again. Parmesan and Black Truffle are such great flavors, it seemed like it would be a can't miss. Oh well, should have gone for the Oxtail Chili Fires. The waiter showed up about 10 minutes after putting our order in to tell us they were out of the Chili Chicken. Seems like pretty bad management to be out of half the beers on the list and multiple products on the menu. We ordered some Ramen after 10 minutes of trying to get the waiter to explain some of the ingredients. He was no help so we chose one on a whim. Turned out to be alright, but like the fries, not something I would come back for. The under cooked burger turned out to be the high light of the meal.  I was so hoping for an amazing burger and all round good meal, but it wasn't to be this time. I might try the place in Pasadena, but there are so many better burger places in the LA area that I can't see wasting a trip to relive this experience.",

We had the Ronin, Blue and Green, and Bachi burgers.  We also had the steamed bun with short rib.  The short was a bit dry and chewy.  The burgers were very good.  Needed a bit more salt.  They probably make them low salt and allow the diner to add some of the sea salt they have at the table.  The Green and Blue had just the right amount of blue cheese.  Not overpowering.  The parm fries and s&p fries were crispy and are served with a nice dipping sauce.  Overall a good experience and well worth the price.

That being said, I cut Bachi Burger quite a bit of slack on my visit because I know they might not have the experience in the business yet to know how important something like, I don't know, having glasses that AREN'T chipped is (also I took a Xanax so that might have helped their case).  Our server was pleasant, but like others, she disappeared after our order was taken. We all ordered a specialty drink and when I got mine I noticed the bottom was extremely chipped. I flagged down a second waitress (Jordan) and asked for a glass that wasn't chipped (you know, so I don't ACCIDENTALLY DRINK GLASS AND DIE) and she went to the counter, pulled one glass out, saw it was also chipped and came back with it to my table. \"Well, all the glasses are chipped,\" she said, \"Is yours sitting on the table weird or something?\" Nope, it sat on the table just fine, I just didn't want to have to sue her place of employment when I cut the crap out of myself.  Whatever, I let it go and drank out of the chipped glass as I watched her walk to a table in the corner, sit and take her break for ten minutes. I drank out of the chipped glass as I watched a very tall gentleman, whose only job I observed in the 90 minutes we were there seemed to be macking on the waitresses, come over and chat her up. Fine, everyone is allowed a break, just maybe, you know, NOT in the dining room where everyone can see you including the 10 people waiting in the lobby to be seated. The rest of our meal went pretty much like many of the other reviews listed: food brought out in a seemingly arbitrary order, drinks going unfilled for 10 minutes or longer (at one point I actually went to the counter, took the pitcher and filled my drink myself), burgers that were requested medium rare coming out medium, etc. I had to go up to the counter again to order flag someone down to take my desert order and Jordan, the \"Is it sitting on the table weird\", came over to take it. Then ten minutes later our actual server came over again to take our desert order. It was just very chaotic and frustrating.    Obviously the management at Bachi Burger KNOWS of these issues. They clearly read the yelp page and I'm clearly not the first person to complain, but they've done NOTHING to fix it. Maybe they just don't know how or just don't care because enough of us come back anyway, even with the poor service.  I would really like to see this restaurant shaped up Gorden Ramsey style. Whoever the tall gentleman I mentioned previously was I didn't see him do anything the entire evening. Strike that, he leaned on things and flirted VERY well, but unfortunately that didn't help us get our food. Everyone else, even the manager/owner, was running food so I don't know if they are just short staffed or poorly managed or inexperienced or all three. I give them two chipped stars.",

    "text": "This restaurant, in an unassuming strip mall in an unassuming neighborhood of Las Vegas, served one of the best meals I've ever had in this city.  We vacation often in Hawaii, and one of the wonderful things about the islands is the way that they manage to take local, organic ingredients and elevate casual food like burgers and noodles in a way that makes them amazing.  Almost from the moment I walked in the door, I was transported back to Hawaii, and was not surprised to learn that the owners came from there.  This is the best of foodie casual food, and everything we had was delicious, creative, and well-prepared.  Flavor is everywhere.  Skip the high-priced, over-hyped Strip restaurants, and head straight over here.  Yum!",

I felt like the restaurant needed to establish themselves with better servers (& they have!!). The burgers are so delicious here that my fiance and I have been taking our friends and fam from out of town here.  Everyone agrees that the burgers/fries/dessert are soooo good, they have *bachi* cravings.  Some of our faves are the Ronin & Kiki.  Most of our group like the garlic salt & pepper fries and the sweet potato fries.  They also have refillable iced matcha green tea and a wide selection of boba teas.  The boba teas are good, but I've had better. I like going to actual boba tea establishments for that.  One night around 11pm, my friends and I did not know where to go for dessert and no one wanted to go to the strip or get yogurt.  It's so awesome that bachi is opened late and we got to eat the portuguese donuts, bread pudding and pop tart (OMG they don't have these anymore...).",

Since there were so many choices we asked our server for recommendations. She said the most popular ones were the Banh-Mi, Miyagi-san's, and Shogun burgers.    I had the Miyagi-san's Burger: wagyu beef, chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings. It was good but could have been a little more flavorful. I think the quality of the beef made the burger great.   We shared 2 types of fries:  Just fries served with pineapple ketchup which was literally just fries. I probably wouldn't order this again. Sweet potato fries served with yuzu citrus aioli. These fries were really good!!   The portion sizes were pretty huge. 3 of us could not finish the 2 orders of fries and I could only finish 1/2 of my burger. It was a little pricey but your'e getting a lot for it.  Glad I tired Bachi Burger but not sure I would come back again.",

I frequent Vegas but don't care to spend $50 for a cab just to try places beyond the strip. Done that a few times before. This time around, we drove in and from a long evening of driving we craved burgers.   We were seated 10 minutes  upon arrival. This place was packed for a Friday evening with NBA playoff games being shown from the many flatscreen tvs. I scoured thru the menu hungry and found what I wanted... Miyagi-san's grass fed wagyu burger and a glass of iced matcha green tea. This burger reminds me a bit of Holstein's Rising Sun which is one of my favorites.   This burger is delicious. The patty is delicious with a baste of teriyaki sauce. It has great flavor with the creamy slight kick of the chili mayo, sweet and slight saltiness of the furikake, textures and caramelized backon and crispy onion rings. My two other sidekicks had the Ronin Burger and Kiki's Burger which they thought were just okay.   The ice green tea was just okay. A bit on the water down side. Expected as it was unlimited refills. Wish they has a simple syrup to sweeten it up instead of dumping 5 sugars in there not dissolving properly.   Worth another visit for me to try other items. A must stop if you're driving in and stopping by Vegas.",

You know when you head back home & miss food from your vacation? This was it for me! I was skeptical ordering a loco moco that didn't sound traditional. It had a wagyu burger over risotto with 2 eggs, grilled onions, & sriracha bacon jam. It was so flavorful & each part of the meal was perfectly made. I devoured it. My husband ordered a burger also with wagyu beef. Also very delicious, but was $26?! Never heard of a burger that expensive before.   Service was fairly good. They almost forgot about my cocktail. Everyone was busy trying to keep up with the crowd. Overall, we loved Bachi Burger enough that we'll probably coming back the next time we're in Vegas.   Heads up! It gets packed so be prepared to wait awhile.",

I also got to try their yuzu citrus aioli sauce on the side free of charge since our order took quite a long time.   The burger was a work of art when it came out. It was a tower of juicy goodness as the sauces ran down the burger. Getting messy was inevitable, and I had no shame diving into the burger. The first bite left me feeling overwhelmed with satisfaction (I was starving to begin with). There was so much flavor in the burger, and that Asian kick you get from the sauce they used was fantastic.   I can't recommend this burger place enough.

    "text": "I'm usually weary when a friend suggests a fancy burger joint, especially since I derive most of my burger pleasure from the likes of a quick and affordable visit to In-N-Out. But, I like Bachi Burger for a couple of reasons: the location is off the Strip, making parking easy and the burgers are damn good and full of flavor.   Bachi is one of the few fusion restaurants where the menu works on so many levels. Drink options include several Japanese import beers, boba milk teas, iced teas, and house sodas. I tried the cherry yuzu soda, which was quite refreshing. We started the meal with oxtail chili cheese fries. The portion was huge and meant to be shared. I loved the flavors of meat, cheese, garlic aioli, topped off with a perfectly runny fried egg.   There were several options of specialty burgers to choose from. I went with the Ronin burger while my friend got the Kiki's burger. These burgers were all about flavor and texture. The angus beef was perfectly cooked, but everything worked so well together from the cole slaw to the miso goma dressing with the perfectly toasted buns. The yuzu citrus aioli was also a nice complement. Although I liked my burger better, the Kiki's burger is a great alternative, especially if you love mushrooms. Three different types of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, and a sweet onion marmalade takes this burger's flavor in a completely different direction. Bachi Burger is one of the few places in Vegas where I will endorse a $12-15 burger.",

We ALWAYS eat here when in Vegas.  Have also brought several clients here for business meetings, and everyone has loved it!  Yes, the burgers are more expensive then your average burger place, but worth every penny!  YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE!!!",

    "text": "I'm an avid viewer of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and I've always wanted to go to the places that Guy goes to but most of the time they are on the other side of the states. When I saw that he went to a burger joint in Vegas that was Asian fusion? I quickly bookmarked it and was already anticipating my next Vegas trip. I've been here twice since and I'd have to say that this is one of my favorite burger joints.  Not located anywhere near The Strip, but relatively close by in the neighboring city of Henderson The restaurant is tucked away in a plaza but easy to find and plenty of parking. Make sure you call in advance to see how long the wait is! I usually call and the wait time for me around dinner time is around 15 mins or so for a party of 8. The wait area is small with a few chairs. The restaurant is cute, simple, and modern. The service is quick and fast and the workers are friendly.  Since I've been here twice, I've gotten the opportunity to try many different things, especially since I shared with one of my friends!  --Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: Holy Oxtail! My favorite appetizer here for sure. When you pop the yolk on the fried egg and let it drip down onto the fries, it's literally food porn. The fries are nicely fried, the oxtail is sweet yet tender, and the chili is delicious. A very savory yet sweet appetizer and I love! 5/5  --Pork Belly Steamed Buns: Took a couple bites of this and I like it! Probably my second favorite appetizer. The pork belly was fatty and savory and together with the steamed bun, boiled egg, and the hoisin sauce made it extra yummy. 4/5  --Hot Crab n' Creamy Cauliflower Dip: Ordered this on a whim with my friend to share and I did not like it at all. It sounded good with the artichoke and cauliflower, but the flavors were so odd. The crab was extra fishy and the lap chong did not compliment the fishiness at all. It was horrible but it wasn't delicious either. I stayed away from this. 2/5  --Kikis Burger: This was the first burger I tried and the variety of mushrooms in this burger is what sold me. The burger was so juicy and delicious. The garlic chili aioli was a nice finishing touch to the burger as well. If you're having a hard time choosing a burger, I'd say this is a simple yet delicious burger to try. 4/5  --Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger: I had this burger this past weekend and anything with a fried egg is already a plus in my book. After one bite, my eyes literally rolled back. It was so darn good! The fried onions, the bacon, the egg... and best of all you can really taste the quality in this burger. It was juicy and flavorful. 5/5  To many, many more trips back to Bachi Burger whenever in Vegas. Although, I heard that they may be opening one in LA?",

My bf got the \"Kiki's Burger\" which was good as well but the miyagi was way better the flavor was just out of this world, we got truffle fries which were also amazing and Bacon Takana fried rice, everything was exceptional! I would say that staff was not very attentive and we found ourselves trying to get their attention but wont stop us from going back!",

I've been here a few times based on recommendations from a friend and it's becoming a go to place while in town, but better have a car as it's a pretty pricy ride from the strip which suits me just fine, so this gem doesn't get covered in weekenders and convention goers.   I had the spicy miso burger which was a no brainer with my love for shishito peppers.  The burger is delicious with a nice soft bun and packed full of flavor.  Along with it we had oxtail chili fries which were delicious with good thin fries that weren't over cooked or soggy - perfect crunch!",

    "text": "Thank god this place is opening a location off Sawtelle in Los Angeles because they've got juicy delicious burgers here.  Shogun Burger: The burger I must say is super over priced. $26 bucks! Apparently if you order a Wagyu Burger Meat (Their specialty meat) its $16 alone + whatever it is you are ordering. But the meat itself was cooked in a way where it was really juicy but also made me think of a house bbq with good company except the meat is much more marinated in its own type of flavor. Not overly juicy but not super dry. The perfect burger as I would describe it. It came with a small puree peach just to clean your pallet before taking an enormous bite into that burger.  Pork Belly Buns: If you love pork.. You are definitely going to love this bun. This chunk of pork belly in a bun bao is juicy. Soft. Delicious. You cannot go wrong with this appetizer. Yum!  Mushroom Truffle Fries: The sauce was delicious. Dont be on a diet trying this place out because youre totally going to regret it lol",

We looked at the menu on their website before we got seated and decided what we wanted. When we saw our bill it was six dollars more expensive. Each of our burgers were two dollars more than what the website stated as well as the fries we ordered. I guess the prices have gone up but they never fixed their prices. We also did not receive good service. The hostess was the only good service we had. She was very sweet. Our waiter seemed very confused and unorganized. He seemed to be rushing us the whole time. The service does not match the quality of food. I would still go back for the great burgers but hopefully we will get a different server next time.",

Truffle fries were a big let down, a bit soft and the aroma was not there.  The ones at Noras was way better, it was the type of fries that you didn't want to stop eating.  The Miyagi burger suppose to be wagyu Kobe beef, cooked medium rare, but the tempura battered onion rings were luke warm to cold, and with a burger that is the last thing I was expecting.  Drenched in sauces which was not necessary.  Took a bite of just the beef patty alone, flavorless... It didn't have the sweetness in wagyu beef that melts in your mouth.    The Kiki burger Kobe beef, medium rare, too much sauce, flavorless beef...    At the end I talked to the manager about some of the issues because the server did not believe my comments, realized I was correct and,manager apologized... Good save by the manager... Overall drenching a burger in Japanese sauces doesn't constitute Japanese style burgers when the most important beef is not promoted as the main flavor of the burger...",

Granted I know it is in a strip mall and that the space is \"cozy,\" so I was prepared for a little wait.  As soon as we entered, we were immediately greeted by the manager (or owner?) who quickly took our name and asked us to have a seat...should be about 10 minutes. The environment was pleasing...open space, sofas to wait while the tables are being turned over, TV's on the wall...typical neighborhood diner.  And 10 minutes later, we were seated.    The menu had many eye-catching descriptions for what I've heard are incredible burgers.  If I didn't visit their website beforehand, I wouldn't have really understood (or appreciated some of the selections).  They were limited on their \"adult libations\" to beers, wines and saki...but they were able to create something with saki for our group that was pretty tasty.  The only issue I had with Baci was their service.  It wasn't that it was semi-busy and they had a limited wait staff to serve everyone, it was our server who was not really listening to us and messed up the drink order numerous times and acted frustrated.  To further complicate things, we had multiple servers come by the table to ask the same thing of us...it was like they were not working together in harmony.  Serving the food was a bit unusual as the menu is basically burgers and fries, yet when they brought our food out, they only brought the burgers...saying the fries would be out shortly.  Hmmm, shouldn't you serve them together?  Again, I think the food was incredible and will try other items on the menu again soon...just get the wait staff a little better trained and it should further elevate the experience for Baci Burger.",

    "text": "Las Vegas is my hometown and I am there a few times a year to visit family. Bachi Burger was built during my last year in Vegas before I moved to Boston literally two minutes away from my house.  Bachi has the best burgers I have ever tasted in my life. Hands down. I cannot find the words to describe them. I could search the volumes of Poe and Emerson and Twain and even their brilliance combined could not do poetic justice to this burger.  I have since adopted a vegetarian lifestyle and this burger is one of the few meats I miss eating. I still insist on going to Bachi Burger every time I am home for a visit. Their salt and pepper fries (with huge chunks of garlic and jalapeno) and garlic aioli are delicious and I love to snack on them.  If you like burgers, go have a bachi burger. If you don't like burgers, go anyway. It'll make you like burgers.   Oh, and my favorite Bachi memory? I took my boyfriend there for the first time for lunch. He and I were still hanging out at 7 pm and I asked where he wanted to go for dinner. At his request we went back to Bachi Burger.   While waiting to be seated a man walked in and asked us if we'd ever eaten there before. My boyfriend's response was, \"Yeah, for lunch.\" The guy told us he had initially been at a restaurant down the street and asked the hostess there if Bachi was any good. She told him it was ok, but he decided to take our word for it.",

It was grilled and a little on the sweet side. Tasted like sea bass. The lamb burger looked amazing even though I didn't eat it. Giant bowl of Ramen was good. Topped it off with a cherry shake with vodka! My 5 year old wasn't a fan on his chicken fingers and ended up eating the apples and carrots.  A little disappointed they charged me for extra apples and carrots but it's a business. Would go back for the fries!",

The first time i've had it was 5 days ago (and i've had a million cravings since.)   KALBI BURGER -- you did me good.THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER FINISHED A BURGER AT A RESTAURANT. if you like korean BBQ, and you like KIMCHI cucumbers, this burger is definitely for you. the bun was soft and fluffy which was enough to compliment the korean sesame seasoned beef patty. the side of kimchi cucumbers boosted the flavorful burger. it added a zesty smell which wasn't spicy, but very stimulating with E-V-E-R-Y singleeeeee bite.   JUST FRIES WITH PINEAPPLE KETCHUP-  Y U TASTE SO GOOD? yet so simple. definitely worth trying. but they charge 50 cents for extra. the pineapple definitely enhanced the distinctive aroma of regular plan ol' ketchup.   k. i can't type anymore, the more i think about how good this place was, the sooner i'll die from separation anxiety and depression.",

    "text": "Me and my friend ate way too much but it was freakin' worth it. We show up around 2pm and there was a 25 minute wait. Plus this is way off the strip like close to the desert off. It was a $30 cab ride from the strip but $10 to the airport.   As appetizers we got the pork buns and the oxtail chili cheese fries. Holy crap they were so good. The buns were soft and not heavy and the pork belly had enough fat that melted in my mouth. It had the hoisin sauce on the side for dipping which was super tasty and great sweetness to it. I think its not as good as Momofuku's pork buns but its still up there. Probably my second favorite. The oxtail chili cheese-fries was bangin!! It was so heavy because of beans and sunny side up egg but still so worth it. The jalapenos were to hot to eat because of the 113 degree weather but any other day it would have been fine.  We could have stopped eating and that could have been all we ate. Of course we didn't and made ourselves look like fat asses when ordering the burgers.   He had the Ronin and I had the $26 dollar Shogun burger. The Shogun burger was so rich and soft because it literally melted in my mouth. If I was 76 years old with False teeth and couldn't eat burgers anymore I would be in heaven. It is made of Wagyu Beef & Unagi  Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach. The bun also  soft and sweet that I really felt that I wasn't eating a lot at all. I think it's over priced by like 3 bucks but I would still recommend it because of the very rich flavors. We tried finishing it all but we realized it was too much food.   It was funny our waiter Mark was like, \"So you will be having the pork buns as your main course..\" and I stopped him and was like, \"Haha Hell no. I'm getting a burger also.\" And he gave that look like I did not know what I was getting into but sure enough took my order.   Service was really good. They refilled our waters every second they got and catered to our needs. I wish there was a place like this in the Tri-state area.",

He did not want to listen to or address my concern. He kept cutting me off to over-explain their shortcomings.  I ordered the Kalbi Burger, which is my favorite, therefore this is not the first nor second nor third time eating this meal. I specified my temperature as Medium-Well. My burger came out very pink in the middle and I sent it back. They took my eaten burger and put it in the oven, as I was told-Um Yuck. This doesn't sound like good practice to me. I would expect a new patty, grilled to my order specification. Even with the oven baked, eaten patty on this second try, it was still pink in the middle. By this time, I have taken two bites of raw beef, have been waiting almost an hour for dinner as I ordered it, and am pretty frustrated. I again returned the plate this time requesting for a new burger to be made and for it to be removed from my bill. The waitress states that I will still be charged for the meal. Huh?! Really??!! I've been waiting to eat my dinner, you guys can't get it right and I am still required to pay for it. Worst customer-service ever!! Alex needs retraining and Bachi Burger needs to reevaluate their customer service standards. So beware, the only thing I was fed at Bachi Burger tonight was raw meat and a bunch of BS!!",

There was shredded oxtail in there, but the chili seasoning flavor just overpowered the goodness of the oxtail so you couldn't get any flavor from it.  I was with a group so I got to try a few different burgers. The Black & green burger was alright but just tasted like any Blue cheese burger. The Kiki's burger just tasted like a grilled onion and mushroom burger and the Miyagi burger just tasted like a caramelized onion burger. The burgers were no stand outs to any other burgers. Yes the burger patties were juicy and tender, but lacked flavor. Did not taste like they seasoned it with any salt or seasoning. Red Robin's burgers taste better in my opinion. I guess I should of put some salt on it myself but I wanted to eat it as it was supposed to be. I also think that the patties had too much of a char on them. The bun though was light fluffy and a little sweet which was really good. It is the bun used to make Chinese baked BBQ pork buns.",

My wife and I stopped in on a Sunday evening around 6. When we arrived, seating was available, but shortly after being seated, the place filled up and there was a line at the door. We ordered the Bachi Pickles, and found them delightful. My wife had the BBQ Bachi Angus burger, and I ordered the Ronin Burger. We split an order of Sweet Potato fries fixed in the Parmesan Truffle style.The food was served in an appropriate amount of time, and it was hot and delicious. The portions are quite large, but the food was so good we stuffed ourselves.   Our server was friendly, competent and knowledgeable. Although the restaurant was full, and there were families and kids, the noise level was not overly loud. We were able to carry on a conversation without straining to hear each other. It was a very happy and fun experience, and we do plan to return when we are in Vegas again. Highly recommended.",

It was definitely smaller than I expected.  We ordered the garlic fries which were okay. They weren't soggy which was good. My husband had a make your own burger with an egg, grilled onions, and cheddar and I had the Miyagi burger. The meat was delicious and I would expect it to be so with how much the burgers costed. My burger was actually the first burger I have had that didn't have any cheese on it, but it was still juicy enough to where it still worked out.   Our server wasn't really that great. We're not the types to want to be checked up on constantly, but not being checked up doesn't go by unnoticed. When my husband got his drink there was a piece of mint or some type of green leaf in it which was big enough to where I don't know how the server didn't see it if he was paying any attention.   The price for our two burgers, two fries, and a soft drink came out to being about $50 before tip.   All in all, the place was okay, and not great. It wasn't a place where I knew right away I would be coming back very soon and especially for the price, I didn't feel it was worth it. The meat was good, but I feel like it's only better in your head because you know the beef is grass fed beef. I can definitely eat at different burger joints without missing this place or thinking about it in the back of my head.",

It's more casual, so unfortunately they don't take reservations, so if you drive out from the strip with gourmet burgers on the brain, you'll likely have a wait in front of you...we were told 25-30 min for a table for two.  It didn't appear to be packed and there we definitely open seating at the bar, so the wait did seem a bit extended.  Fortunately they did set us up sooner than the 25 min (more like 15).  I ordered the Kiki's burger and the wife had the Miyagi-San burger.  We also ordered the garlic Parmesan fries with a side of spicy aoli.  The burgers were delicious and the patties cooked perfectly medium as requested.  It was a bit weird that the fries did not come at the same time as the burgers.  We were 1/2 way through and just before I was going to flag a server for them, the fries arrived.  They were still good, but I've a feeling someone dropped the ball a bit when the burgers were ready. Otherwise, the service was good and the staff very friendly.  I had a Rogue Draft black lager that complemented the Kiki burger nicely.  We both shared the malasada dessert, which came out nice and hot, but no where near the nice fluffy authentic ones you can get on the islands at Leonard's.",

    "text": "Call the health department about the raw food and fire Frank the manager!!!!!!    I went to Bachi Burger tonight on the recommendation of a friend.  I ordered a Kiki Burger medium rare.  I typically like hamburgers rare, but this was a burger in a restaurant, so I ordered it medium rare.  I was so hungry I was five bites in before I realized what I was eating....the burger was raw inside.  I asked my friend who was a chef to look too, and she confirmed that it was raw.   Not to mention, it was horribly sweet.  I would have ignored the bad taste, I was starving, but it was disgusting inside.  Raw and cold inside.    The manager came over to check on us and I didn't want to say anything, but my husband piped up and said \"her burger is rare, and she doesn't like it so she would like to order something else.\"  Rather than take the plate away and apologize, he started to argue with my husband.  He said \"that is how we serve our burgers and if you don't like it, you should have ordered it another way.\"  My husband said \"you are out of your mind if you think that is medium rare....where do you go from here if someone wants a rare burger?  You haven't left yourself any room to be more raw.\"  So, now I am uncomfortable.  I didn't want to say anything in the first place, but the manager did ask.  He took the plate away.  He came back, with the plate in his hand, and demanded my name.  He sort of stood there and asked as if he was going to write my name on the wall in the back.  I was speechless.  My husband told him his name and demanded to know why I was being asked.  The manager then said that he had had a discussion with another manager and they \"were concerned that the burger had been half eaten.\"  I was shocked.  He started attacking me and demanding to know why I had eaten as much of the burger as I had if I \"really didn't like it\" and that under no circumstances would they refund any money!     My husband and I are quite comfortable financially.  We have been fortunate enough to retire well and early and the last thing I would ever do is to try to scam half a hamburger from someone.  Moreover, we never asked to get anything for free.  Now, that doesn't mean I wouldn't expect a decent restaurant to offer.   I have sent food back maybe 5 times in my whole life, and each of those times I was offered free food and had to fight to pay for it anyway.  Most of the time it isn't their fault if I don't like something.  But, this was different....the food was raw.   Even still, we didn't ask for anything for free.     My husband was so angry, as was my friend.  I just wanted to crawl under the table and die.  This manager is standing there yelling at me for something I haven't done.  We were ready to walk out, when the manager walked away.  It was only because of the waiter that we stayed.  He was so very kind.    The manager then comes back a little while later and tries to apologize.  But, in doing so he makes the snarkiest little comment....he says he will take 25% off and he will give me the burger I sent back in a box to go.  The last thing I wanted was to ever see that burger again.  It was disgusting.  My husband said, if he wanted to take 25% off the check as an apology that might satisfy him.  But, boy was I miserable.  I have so far been fed terrible raw food, been yelled at for not liking it and then treated like a dog when I was told I should take that food home and eat it later..and why did they still have it?     When we were ready to go, I found out the manager had taken a lousy 2.50 off!  Turns out he meant he would take 25% off the price of the ten dollar disgusting burger, not the whole check as he should have.  I was vomiting in the bathroom at this time or I would have demanded that we pay the extra $2.50, I don't need his lousy money.  Oh, yes...I was vomiting in the restroom.  It is 5 hours later and I am still doubling over from cramps.  Was it the burger?  Either that, or the potato chips I had earlier in the day.  My bet is on the burger.     I should have taken that mealy burger to go so I could show it to the health department.    My friend was so embarrassed that she had suggested the place, my husband was put in a miserable position, and I was in tears (at least on the inside, on the outside, I think I kept the tears from falling.)  Why did he ask my name?  Why did he tell me that it was my fault that I didn't know that medium rare meant raw inside to them?  Why did he assume I was trying to steal from him?  I am a size 8.  do I look like someone who tries to steal a half a hamburger?  Why did I eat that awful burger and have to have these awful cramps all night?  Oh why oh why did I ever go to Bachi burger????    Update:  The owner was kind and after he heard about this said that Frank had been spoken to and he apologized deeply and said this is not the kind of service they expect...and he gave my friend a gift card and even waited on us when we retur",

I ordered the Peking duck steamed buns, the hubby had the Kiki burger and we split truffle parmesan fries.  The steamed buns were okay.  The flavors were pretty flat without the hoisin dipping sauce.  I'm not a big fan of food that requires sauce to make it better, but the sauce made it better than blah and boring combined.  They are served like sliders with three slices of duck, a slice of hard biked egg, a radish sliver and a bunch of cilantro folded inside each bun.  The three small buns were more of an appetizer than an entree.  The hubby's burger was much better in comparison; big, juicy and full of flavors.  The truffle fries were also pretty amazing.",

    "text": "The food here is DELICIOUS! My husband and I are huge fans of DDD and saw this place featured on the show. While on our trip in Vegas, we had to make a stop here. We came on a Sunday around 3:30 and got a table relatively quick. We waited about 10 minutes. Not too bad compared to what I've read on other Yelp reviews. We ordered the Oxtail Chili fries and shared a Banh Mi Burger. I was in heaven! I loved them both. My favorite part bout the fries were the fried egg. It was like eating potatoes and eggs for breakfast with some delicious oxtail chili! My husband didn't care for the egg, so it worked out perfectly. I got the egg to myself. ;) The Banh Mi burger had wonderful flavor. If you've ever had a Banh Mi and love it, you will enjoy the Banh Mi burger. It marries the flavors of Asian and American perfectly.   Before leaving Vegas, we went again. This time on a Wednesday at around the same time. Once again, we got in right away but there was only one server working and he was running all over place. There were about 4 other tables that he was waiting on besides us. I don't understand why it's so understaffed. I did notice what looked to be a manager (based on what he was wearing) and two other gals \"working\" in the back. The manager looked like he was keeping himself busy walking around and the girls were putting together silverware packages. This time, we ordered the Oxtail Chili Fries again and the Pork Belly Sliders. Fries were still delicious, but I wasn't too impressed with the sliders. The pork was a little dry in the meaty parts which made it a bit hard to chew and swallow. The flavor was good, but I'd rather have a burger.   We will definitely be hitting this place up anytime we are in Vegas. There are so many burgers I still want to try! Overall, I gave it a 4 for GREAT food but so so service.",

When we arrived we were told that the wait was about 25-30 minutes for a party of 5. The hostess said we could go to their new location where the place is bigger and no wait time. However, the new location is 15 miles away. We opted to stay and wait. We sat at the bar and placed our drink order. So glad we did because before we even got our drinks, our table was ready!    The food is out of control with the perfect portions. Our server was awesome. He was very friendly and answered all of our questions. We ordered the sweet potato and Truffle Parmesan fries as appetizers. We were starving.  I had the Pork Belly Steamed Buns -- so flipping tasty. I found them to be better without the sauce. My sister-in-law had the same thing. She seemed to like the sandwich with the sauce.  My husband had the Ronin burger -- delicious is an under statement. The meat was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Out of control....  My niece and cousin had the Spicy Miso Burger -- they each  devoured their burger and couldn't stop making comments about how delicious it was.  We all shared the oxtail chili cheese fries...wowwww....explosive flavor in your mouth. You must try these chili fries!!!  The over all experience was fantastic. We're definitely going back the next time we're in Vegas.",

I don't remember what sauce it was, but boy did it compliment that burger and fries.  The burger might not look big, but it sure is filling.  Along with the burger and fries I ordered an almond milk tea with boba, and I should know better than to order boba from a burger place. The almond did not have much flavor, and the boba was bland as well.  The waiters were friendly, nice, and patient. If I come back to Vegas I'd definitely eat there again.",

    "text": "Bachi Burgers, where have you been my entire life, and why can't I eat you in San Diego, CA.  There are so many positives about BB that Yelp should allow an extra star for just them because they're the only one worthy of that extra star.  BB was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, which that alone should warrant a visit.  But after my first visit, which arose because of many friends' recommendations, the reason BB is a must visit destination is resoundingly THE FOOD.  Let's put it this way, after my niece took her first bite of BB's renown Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, she said, \"I want to come here for my birthday.\"  We live 4.5 hours away.  Not too subtly, ORDER THE OXTAIL FRIES!!!  We were carnivorous after driving from San Diego, so when my better half posted on Facebook what our friends recommended to eat in Sin City, Bachi Burgers kept coming up.  There are multiple BBs in Vegas, so I chose the one with 1000+ reviews, which that alone should say something.  BB is located in a strip mall looking discreet and hidden towards the back, but the long line of people gives it away.  You will wait if you come during peak lunch or dinner times, but it truly is worth the wait.  Both the outside and inside is discreet, but you will see and taste food that's not discreet.  The inside decor comprised of black, complemented by the black attire of the staff, gives off a modern and chic flair.  Loved the Asian influenced artwork, specifically this panda painting.  Enough of my Yelp review format of describing the restaurant, let's get to why throngs can't get enough of BB.  The lower case letters of the name attached to the building exemplifies modesty, but BB's food is not modest in taste and deliciousness.  Here's what we ordered:  Bachi pickles, Oxtail chili cheese fries, Salt & Pepper garlic french fries, BBQ Bachi Burger 8oz Grass Fed Wagyu, Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, and a mandarin orange drink.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that all of the food above was to die for.  The Miyagi-san and the oxtail fries will be on my last meal wish list.  The pickles, an assortment of pickled vegetables, had that salt and vinegar thing going and I practically ate everything by myself.  The oxtail fries was piled high on a plate and our party of 6 cleaned the plate in minutes.  The mixture of the oxtail, chili, cheese, and the broken yolk was heavenly melodic to our stomachs.  Everyone in our party couldn't stop talking about how great the food was.  My Miyagi burger will be ordered again when I return.  This burger is my favorite burger of all time.  EVER!  This beats my previous #1 at Hodad's in San Diego.  The meat alone was juicy, succulent, and tasted like a premium cut from a very expensive cow.  The fried onions kept its crispiness and blended well with the tasty caramelized bacon.  The chili mayo was flavorful.  What put this burger over the top was the salivating broken yolk from the egg.  WOW!  Highly recommend the mandarin orange drink to wash everything down.  I'm bummed that I have to drive 4.5 hours to eat my latest additions to my last meal list.  For Las Vegas residents who can eat here all the time, I'm jealous.  For those that are visiting, a must visit despite the wait.  I like my niece's idea.  I want to come here for my birthday too.",

    "text": "I've been here on multiple occasions and I love it every time! Asian fusion hamburgers done right! If you're gonna add asian ingredients, GO ALL THE WAY! Don't just add teriyaki sauce to the same patty you use for your boring burgers.  Ronin Burger: I'm a loyal fan forever! The sauce that they give you just takes the burger to a whole other level. Dip it, drizzle it, drench it. Do it all and your mouth will reward you.   Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: Why didn't anyone think of frying an egg and adding it on top before?! So yummy, although a few times I've had it I could tell the chili has been sitting on the stove all day. But I'd still eat it, and definitely share it with a group because you'll probably get a heart attack from how much calories are in this bad boy.  Banh Mi Burger: Those pickled veggies! YUMM-O!  Mr. Ho Burger?: I forget the name because I took a bite from my friend, but I think this one has taro bread which is definitely interesting if you love mixing savory sweet. Unfortunately I don't, but I'd definitely share this with someone just for a bite.    Miyagi Burger: A little hyped up for my taste, but still pretty good compared to your average American hamburger.  Pork Belly Sliders: I've only had this once, and we took it to go because we were so stuffed. Didn't eat it until we were in our hotel room, where it was cold. Still tasted good, but I need to come back to taste it hot!  My sister also ordered the lychee soda also very good and interesting!  If you don't love Bachi Burger, you definitely should go to In-N-Out and add some teriyaki sauce.",

    "text": "Am I lame for saying this was my most looked forward to place during my weekend Vegas getaway? At least it didn't disappoint! Unfortunately, this was a forced meal - as in, we came here on our way out of Vegas hungover af and not even hungry. But we ordered a lot of food anyway... For the two of us, we got the oxtail chili cheese fries, pork belly steamed buns, and the shogun burger.   Oxtail chili cheese fries $11.50: This was really good! The chili was heavy in taste (good for the chili but can't say I know what oxtail tastes like) but I wish there was more cheese. Definitely a plate to be shared.  Pork belly steamed buns $10: Very Asian tasting (good thing obviously)! The glaze on the pork belly is sweet (how it's supposed to be). Comes with three, definitely share this too!  Shogun burger $26: The grand finale... The major components were wagyu beef, unagi (eel), and foie gras. There were no doubt LOTS of flavors but my bf thought it was too much. He wasn't a big fan of the unagi (but I was!). My issue with the burger was that it was way too oily. The combination of two days worth of alcohol and the greasiness of the burger (with the fries and pork belly too) was just too much for me to handle. I definitely had a stomach ache for the rest of the day - not that I'm blaming Bachi Burger. Was it worth $26? Mm I don't think so. I really like foie gras (bf is French) so putting it inside the burger was a bit of a waste to me. Though it did taste really good when I bit into it separately.  Anyway, great place to try! I'd definitely come again when I'm around.",

    "text": "I've been coming here since their opening day and every time I'm in Vegas I make it a  priority to eat here. The food is damn good and the service is hit or miss. I've been here when there as been exceptional customer service and I've been here when my waiter came to our table a total of three times and took 15 mins to get a lemon for my water.   Lets talk food! Even though I complain sometimes about the service...the taste and texture of the food does help the situation. All their buns have a nice crisp outside and a soft, fresh inside. I'm picky about my buns and these are @DmagicP approved!   Must have starters:  - Peking Style Duck Steamed Bun (soooo good!) - Truffle Parmesan Fries - Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - Stir Fried, Garlic, Chili Edamame   Daaaa Buuuuuuurgers:  - Ronin Burger: The Japanese cole slaw, miso dressing, fried egg, and the yuzu citrus aioli make this burger so tasty! It's very flavorful and a simple burger. If you like fried eggs with your traditional burgers, then you will have no problem liking the Ronin.  - Kalbi: It's Kalbi marinated with house made Kim Chee. I just love the taste of marinated Kalbi. The marinated Angus beef is full-bodied with a kick of their house mayo. The meat is tender and cooked to perfection. It almost melts in your mouth. This one is a nice one to have if you've never had Kalbi before.   -Crusty Crab: If you love crab like I do...then you will enjoy this burger!  I like this one not only because it's crab, but the chutney sauce that is on it. I do like chutney and I've never had it with crab meat before. At first it tasted a little intense for me- the avocado, chutney, and tartar sauce but toward the third bite the mixture of flavors started to kick in and it ended up being very palatable.    Bachi Fish: This one is probably my least favorite. I do like fish (Alaskan Cod), but something about the mixture of flavors weren't pleasing to my taste buds. I might have to give this one another try.   Dessert:  - Saigon Cinnamon Bread Pudding w/ Vanilla ice Cream - Portuguese Donuts w/ Coffee Gelato - Chocolate Hazelnut Ice Cream Sandwich (Summer Special)  Beverages:  - Apple Lychee Soda  - Red Velvet Milkshake  - Strawberry Guava Milkshake - Watermelon Boba Milk Tea  You have to come here a few times to experience all the delectable items on the menu! Besides the strip clubs, clubbing, girls, and gambling...this is what's on my mind entering Vegas! Enjoy!  If you eat good food, then you will never have to eat bad food again - @DmagicP",

They do their own buns which makes the burgers that much better.  Try the Ronin Burger or the Black & Green.  The Ronin is Angus Beef and the Black & Green is Wagyu.  Either one is super tender and juicy meat cooked to perfection.  No hockey pucks here folks, we are talking hand formed patties.  Fries - Try the Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries after a quarter way through your burger because once you start, you can't stop.  Can't wait to get back!",

My brother had mention bachi burger for quite a while so I decided to try it out finally. When we first got there the wait wasn't too bad, it was only about 10-15 minutes or so. This was our first time here, the server asked us if we ever been here before since we said no she explained to us what the different types of burgers there were and what she recommended which was pretty helpful. We got the kiki and ronine burger and garlic fries. When the food came out we were all resisting not to eat any of the food since we wanted to snap a picture for facebook (who doesn't do that? lol) Anyways the first bite was amazing. It was so good and tasty. I'm not sure if we were just really hungry since we hadn't ate anything for about 15 hours or if it was really just that good. It was worth $12 bucks in my opinion and the fries was awesome as well. For sure next time i'll be sure to try the banh mi burger and oxtail chili fries. Makes me want to go back to vegas again already. Oh and btw, this place isn't exactly next to the vegas strip. Be prepare to drive a little. It's off blue diamond exit (silverton casino) and about 8 minutes once you exit the freeway. So if your planning to take a taxi it'll be about $20 bucks or more each way. Your better off driving there.",

The server recommended the \"special\" which was a glass (about 16 oz) of Japanese draft beer.  I took it. Well, I got the bill, and it was $10.50 for that glass of draft beer. The server failed to tell me it was 10.50 and I would NEVER in a million years think that a draft beer was going to cost me more then the burger.  I think the server should have communicated that the \"special\" was as pricey as it was.  Its things like this that will keep me from going back, as I feel I was mislead by the word \"special.\"  Also, my friend was eating from a second plate and they came up to the table about 3 times while she had food on the plate asking if they could take it away.  Slightly annoying being interrupted several times when food was on the plate and not pushed away.",

The decor is excellent, and the food will just blow your mind.  My favorite burger is the Ronin burger, it has an asian slaw, fried egg and other toppings that just meld into one delicious experience.  They use egg buns that they toast just a little to get that delicious crunch, then you can pair that with the softness of the burger.  If I remember correctly, they cook their burgers medium, I usually get mine med-well, but I trusted the chefs to know how to cook their meat, and I wasn't disappointed.  This is not your run of the mill burger, its a taste all of its own.  You can get orders of different types of fries, each come with their own dipping sauce.  They even have a few different types of edimame (sorry sp).",

(oh and i think the fact i could smell the stank from the bathroom didn't help)   so maybe for a once in a lifetime trip would be cool if you dont eat much asian food, but if you do avoid it, way too pricey (2 burgers, 1 beer and two sodas and fries was a little more than 50 bucks) and seems to be just the hipster place to go!",

I had garlic fries that had jalopenos on them. not the best. the truffle fries were very good. Had a build up burger, wagyu, blue cheese, onion rings and bacon. rings were sad, bacon was hard, both came out in pieces. to much cheese, over bearing. burger was kind of mince consistency, way to much sweet flaver and inconsisitant thru the paddy. Needs more salt and or spice, white pepper or something for my tastes. Price was very good on fries, $4. burger started at $16 and ended at $18.50. too much. burger size was good. bun was good.  dont think I'll be back. strip burger does it better for less.

We typically go to the one on Russell which is absolutely 5 stars but we decided to go to this one because it was open later; bad choice. Ordered 3 drinks and 2 waters, kids burger, Kiki burger (well done with an egg added) & miyagi burger (well done) & fries. Got our 2 teas and 1 soda, no water. Got all our burgers, even the kids one cooked medium rare, no egg on the burger and no fries. Ignored the egg and waited a few extra on the fries incase they were coming but nope never came. Had to tell a waiter who said he would go check and then came out saying they were coming up which means they were forgotten. A lady then comes out around 10 minutes later with the fries & the egg stating she apologized that they forgot the egg in the first place and it would be taken off the bill. For someone who likes runny eggs, you could tell this was rushed just like the fries, as the egg white, not the yolk, was still runny and the fries were soaked in oil. Definitely will not be returning to this location!!!",

During my first visit, I ordered the Shogun burger and it was the best 20 bucks I ever spent on a burger (yes 20 bucks). The beef was so tender that it just melts in your mouth!! If you're the type that likes try something different this is the place to be. If you don't you can always go to In and Out.LOL",

After reading some of their reviews, I think most of their customers are being extremely generous with their reviews.  If you noticed on most of their reviews, you'll see \"Understaffed, Long Wait, Mediocre Food, Etc.\" but the stars are 4 to 5.    I've been to Bachi Burger four times.  First time, the wait was long (40 min) and they had empty tables.  I ordered the Miso Burger and it was cooked perfectly and delicious, but not worth the wait.  Second visit, another long wait (30 min) and about 40 min wait on our food.  The customers who arrived later than us were served first.  When the waiter realized we didn't get our food and rushed the order.  The waiter even blamed the chef.  If the customer who arrived later didn't order the same burger, I probably would've believed the waiter.  Our burgers came out rare and none of our fries were the right order.  Worst experience on that visit.  Third visit, our friend wanted to try the Miyagi Burger.  Once again, wait was about 30 min for seating.  We observed two open tables.  Long story short, none of us had the right order.  When we got the right order.  We decided to visit the restaurant for the fourth time and give it another chance.  Big mistake...what happened the second visit happened again.  Even though the food is good when properly cooked, the wait and the service isn't worth it.",

He shrugged and was like \"I asked them before and they mumbled something I couldn't understand.\" lolwat? Half the pickles (3 of the 6 types) were pretty sour (eggplant, radish, and some kind of gingery onion -- the others were cucumber, spicy seaweed, and garlic). The pickled garlic was pretty solid, very nutty.  Pork belly bao were good. Wife's comment \"eh, Momofuku's were a lot better, but maybe that's not fair.\" lol  Burgers: Split the Miyagi-san and the Banh-Mi. First bite of Miyagi-san was great with the sesame and the onion rings. But honestly subsequent bites were good-not-great. Banh-mi was overwhelming imo due to the curry. We got through half the burger and just decided to pass on the other half.  Took a PB & Chocolate milkshake to go, and the waitress brought it in a to go cup and then disappeared for like 15 minutes, never bringing the check. There's a reason we ordered that to go! Anyway, milkshake was too thin for my liking (I like thick shakes) but tasted good.  Wife's comment leaving was \"that was fine, but I don't really need to go back.\" I feel the same way.",

I took an employee of mine to lunch while working in Las Vegas to the highly reviewed Bachi Burger. We started with the Ox Tail fries, which months later are still very memorable. Then moved on to our burger choices, I got the Miyagi, it was a difficult choice as so many burgers looked delicious. Each and every bite was better than the last, I highly recommend. Not much on atmosphere, passable but they make up for it with their food. Make note I have only been to the Windmill location. We both agreed, best burger ever.   It has been a few months since I have eaten there, but have sent numerous people never does Bachi disappoint.",

The wait wasn't really an issue as we had a large party (8) and they just needed to setup a bit. While waiting, i scoped out the menu a bit to see what they offered.  The baos looked interesting, but it would have been too much. The party shared the ox tail chili cheese fries and they were pretty tasty. I would like there to be more ox tail, but it was good.  I got the Miyagi-san burger, medium rare, which was grass-fed wagyu, fried egg, bacon, furikake and onion strings. The sauce was a chili mayo. Also got a side of the sea salt fries. Presentation - awesome. The burger looked great and toppings stacked nicely. Good char on the beef.  Taste: Was just okay. Good flavors from the ingredients, but I think the flavor of the meat was kind of lacking. Maybe it was too sweet or something, but I was expecting a more savory taste from the beef. Beef was a letdown and a bit on the flavorless side. I might stick with Angus next time as I had a taste of another burger and it seemed to be more flavorful.  I think what kind of made everything a let down was the service. When going to like a pho restaurant, I expect there to be no service. But when you're serving gourmet burgers with foie gras I would hope there would be something better than what I see at a pho joint.  The servers just seemed a tad surly. No smiles and seems to have a bit of an attitude. Kinda just going through the motions and they ask you for help. Not even in a nice way. Was just \"can you pass this down?\" no please? no thanks?  I can understand if it was a booth and the server can't get to some people. She was just lazy and started giving us appetizer plates and asked us to send them down. Same with the water. Plopped them down at one end of the table and again asked us to pass them down. I was surprised I wasn't asked to pass the food down as well. So they're able to give the food to everyone individually, but water and plates are too much trouble. Towards the end of our meal, some people are still eating, they start clearing the table right as people finish their plates. You get that rushed feeling like they want to kick you out. The fries we shared were still half full and she started to take them away. She only asked if we wanted to continue to eat them after we kinda looked at her taking the fries away. Why so quick to get everything away? It wasn't like there was a line waiting. We were eating lunch at like 2PM. No wait and restaurant was half empty. Oh, and in True fashion, she also asked us to pass the plates up and over to her so she wouldn't have to walk around to each setting and pick up the plates.  Like I said, I'm a bit torn. I think it has potential, but had a pretty eh first experience. They gotta step up their game.",

    "text": "Japanese style handburgers?!? How often are you going to hear that together. That's what attracted to me to this place and in through the front door.   The 1st time I came I ordered the Shogun burger (Pretty sure that's what it's called but it's the most expensive burger that came with kobe patty, unagi, foie grais, etc) and when I first bit into it, it was a taste that immediately wanted me to savor all of the delicious flavors. There's so much flavor in the burger that you could taste the foie grais, unagi, and sauce and enjoy it to it's fullest. You really have to give this burger a try if you go here.  I did come another time and tried the other burger which I believe was the ronin but it did not have nearly as much flavor and would definitely not be that great of an experience.   Your burger doesn't come with any sides like fries so be sure to order some if you'd like. 1 order of fries can easily feed at least 2 people and possibly 3 so don't order one for each person. I also tried some of the drinks like the strawberry jasmine tea lemonade and the momotoro peach drink and they were both not very good and not great drinks to compliment the food.  This place is off the strip so may not be worth it if you have to taxi to get there but if you do make the effort to come out here, you would be punishing yourself for not getting the Shogun burger. I wouldn't even come here again if I didn't order that.",

Staff were very efficient seating people, and the service was great.  After a nice glass of wine, I tried the Mr. Ho burger (Hawaiian).  It was pretty good after you got over the purple (taro) bun, but the flavors did not wow. Next time I will try the Korean version. The sausages appetizer was interesting, and worthwhile if you want some extra meat.  I recommend skipping the salad (overpriced and pedestrian), and the truffle/parmesan fries.  The truffle gravy had no truffle taste, and actually made the French Fries soggy - I recommend the plain fries instead. Overall, the food was good, but not out-of this-world.  However, the bill was - $45 for a burger meal....only in LV!",

This thing was mind blowing. All I have to say is if you have doubts of spending $26 on a burger you will quickly feel like you just got the best deal ever.  The Shogun burger consists of Wagyu beef burger topped with foie gras, unagi, poached Asian pears and miso butter. AMAZING!  The only negative is we ordered two burgers, the Shogun and the Kiki, and made the mistake and ate the Shogun first. The Kiki was just normal after eating that full flavored Shogun. So if you want to try something else while sharing make sure to try the Shogun last.  The pork belly buns and the garlic edamame were also really good. Good eats!",

On our entry, we were promptly greeted & our generous hostesses had us seated right away. I say that in plural as one was in training & the other the trainer, which was very good of the \"trainer\" to inform us.   Our very capable hostess, skated in & out of the kitchen with her pupil in tow, teaching as well as liaising between kitchen & customer. Props to the service.  I shall visit again.",

    "text": "Disappointed seeing grown men argue and the mistreatment of employees!  I was initially excited to watch the 3D episode talking about this spot and the same feeling followed me as I was on my way to the spot too but after I parked the car and was seated within 4 minutes flat it all came to a screeching halt! - I visited the spot with 2 others in which they also saw what I saw and felt awkward for being our first visit and after viewing the same episode on TV. together and venturing from Los Angeles.  Here is the stressed out drama that we encountered. We arrived, greeted, seated, handed the menu, offered choices all going smooth with a smile from our server. Our server was \"Lisa\" she was very nice, very intoned with us and very affected by the experience we and many others were forced to watch while sitting in front of the kitchen/podium area, after placing our order for the same dishes that Guy Fieri featured on 3D we had our beer served up and then boom! \"The Stressed Out Drama\" - While sipping on our beer we encountered a tall Caucasian cook yelling at another gentlemen on the opposite side about doing their job right but what struck us as weird was watching one of them being handled to a back room because it started to get loud and some cuss words. We later found out that the people involved were the actual owners/partners of the spot, very disappointing to experience for being our first time.  After the experience we all decided to leave but your waitress, Lisa talked us down and asked us to stay and apologized for the experience and in seconds brought over our order, and although she seemed bothered about what had happened with them she still gave a wonderful smile.  I gave your location a two stars and these are the reasons why: Yes, you have a wonderful The \"Banh-Mi\" Burger, wonderful Truffle Parmesan Fries w/ Sundried Tomato Aioli & Drizzled Porcini Cream Sauce and a knock out Duroc Pork Belly Steamed Buns with Hoisin BBQ Sauce, would've been better with a Blue Moon beer but you were out that day but all in all, the food was phenomenal, hands down!  I gave you the second star because of your server Lisa, she shined like a star 100% when you couldn't.  NOTE: to the Owners/Managers my tiny group and I agree that although you have problems no matter how big, never! bring them to the spot and especially never! demonstrate to your patrons how negative, ignorant and disrespectful you can be towards one another and your employees not to mention the children present. You guys have wonderful food, don't taint it by your actions.  I hate doing reviews like this because I know you work hard to be top restaurant in your genre - I attempted to speak with you face to face but that went unanswered. Good Luck in your future ventures.",

They trick you into thinking you're getting an f-ton of fries and you're getting about a handful.  Also, their hostesses kept seating people directly next to us, too, which was kind of irritating considering the restaurant was nearly empty. Twice the other diners asked to be moved so they weren't joining us for our meal.  I'd have to be dragged back---to me, it's not worth a revisit.",

    "text": "Asian style burgers? It was good, but it wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be. Reminds me of Umami Burger here in SF, but bigger and better.   Their burgers use the same type of buns for barbecue pork buns! One unique thing I noticed. And their meat patties are marinated in some type of a sweet sauce. The burgers looks and tastes extra juicy!   They also have Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries. The fries were super addicting. It had a sort of a spice to it that made it so sweet yet savory at the same time. I honestly thought the idea of Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries could have been executed better. Hmmn...maybe like more sweetness to the ox tail? Ox tail reminds me of braised beef, so if that slow cooked turned sweet tasting taste was drenched all over fries... I think I would have liked it much better. The chili all over the fries was okay. I sort of avoided eating it... weird I know since it defeats the purpose of having chili on this dish.   I decided to get the Pork Belly buns. Sort of pricy, but pork belly tends to be expensive. Ever since my trip to NYC I have been craving this! It is hard to find a place serving even DECENT pork belly buns. This place was decent. It was dinky but I really liked it! This dish half-filled my satisfaction.   Their boba is fresh too! A bit of an increase in price for your average boba, but they serve it in a nice glass cup!   Friendly workers here! Nice modern Asian fusion burger joint.",

He just said yes I'll be right with you, seriously? ?????? Then the Manager came up to the table to introduce himself and asked us if we have been helped, then he took our drinks order and brought them himself, he then ask if we ware ready for order and took the order himself. The Server only brought the appetizer fries, this was thefirst time he would have a word with us, later someone else brought our food, the manager once more came to check on our table, I have to give it up for him he rocks and was very polite and friendly, but the server seem to be ignoring my table because I saw him interacting with his other tables, anyway  I still going to this place because I love the Food but I would just going to be mentally prepare to know that my service might suck. I am a Server myself and understand that sometimes you are busy but at least you should go to your guests and introduce yourself to let them know that you are aware that they chose yor location to bring their business.  He could it make a decent tip if at least he would it told us his name and smile, but O well,  I hope next time is better.",

I should have known from all the reviews from tourists saying they came here from the strip.  I suppose if you're used to boring overpriced food in Vegas casinos, this place is a step up, but with so many great choices in Green Valley just 5 minutes away, this place doesn't even make the bottom of the list of places I like to eat.  I won't be back.  The oxtail chili cheese fries, meh, I've had better.  What's all the hype?  Mediocre chili heavy on the beans and light on the meat.  Fries were run of the mill boring fries, and the jalapenos not spicy at all.  My wife had just a plain burger with mayo and onions for $16.  She liked it, but it definitely was not a $16 burger  I had the Shogun burger...it was gross.  I removed the overly sweet pears and it was moderately better.  Not a $26 burger for sure.  Way too sweet...  But that seems to be the recurring theme: every single thing on the menu it seems has a sweet flavor.  So if you're craving a juicy, meaty, savory burger, avoid this place.",

Must-try items include the pickled garlic (part of the assorted Bachi pickles - I always ask for extra garlic!), the Kiki Burger, the Black & Green Burger and the often-mentioned Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. And if you're in the mood to eat a bit healthier, their protein-style burgers are just as amazing as the originals, although their hamburger buns are pretty delicious. Sure, Bachi Burger may be a bit more expensive  since you have to order fries a la carte, but it's totally worth it. Compared to other similarly priced burger joints in Vegas, Bachi Burger is hands down the best and most unique.  If you're planning a lunch visit, please get there early. The wait can be pretty lengthy if you get there at Noon.",

And unlike what I've heard from other reviewers, the staff is friendly and willing to help in whatever way necessary.  They'll cook it however you want it.  They'll add items or hold items if you want.  They will go out of their way to make your experience great.  Everything we had was amazing.  The shrimp chips and truffle fries were great.  Everyone had a different burger - all were outstanding.  Even my 5-year-old's kids plain cheeseburger was great.    One caveat...  If you're anything like my wife and aren't an adventurist eater, stick to the \"build your own burger.\"  You'll get a great burger made how you want it and you won't be disappointed.  If you're in the area, stop by.  I'm sure you'll love it.",

The place has gotten so busy since they appeared on Food Network, but the quality is still high.  Last time I was there I ordered pork belly steam buns and truffle parm fries. the Buns are nice and airy and the meat melts right in your mouth. They could of course be bigger for my tastes. The truffle fries are always just a great thing to order for your burger or if some of the appetizers scare you. They has a soft crispness to them and added with the sauce and ketchup they provide really give you a nice experience with them.  Now I have had every burger that they make, but my favorite has to be the Kalbi burger. They marinate it in a nice paste which helps bring out the nice meaty flavor of the burger. The kimchi has a nice crunch and brings more depth to the burger as well.",

I was seated in a table for four. They don't allow eating at the bar! I felt guilty of taking up all this space when people were waiting to be seated. So I sat not facing them. Screw 'um. At any rate, I ordered a Japanese beer I've never heard of. I forgot the name but it came in a 17oz bottle. Very good beer, sorta hoppy between an ale and an IPA. Then I had the Spicy Miso burger. Wasn't spicy at all. Maybe they missed something. But was cooked perfectly (med) and had the miso taste just right. It comes with an egg so prepare for some messy eating. I didn't have any frys and stuff but I'm sure it'll be just as good as the burger. Next, I'm going to try the Hotdog. The guy next to me had one and he said it was great. There's a Ramen place next door. You can actually order Ramen too! The Ramen place wasn't nearly as crowded as Bachi so I wonder if I can order the burger from the Ramen place. This place beats BurgR and B&B in my opinion.",

There was garlic, turnip, radish, cucumber, eggplant....I think I am forgetting a couple.  They all were pickled with different seasonings, so each one was different.  However, I didn't like any of them (to be honest, I hated them) although I tried each one.  Instant stomachache.  I ordered the no meat here veggie burger.  It is a veggie patty with fried tofu and fried eggplant, along with the usual fixins.  I tried to take a bite and burned my mouth.  Let it sit awhile (not long enough, apparently), and burned my mouth again.  Cut it in half, and let it sit awhile (steam pouring out, at this point my old man was just about finished with his burger).  Try number three - burned my mouth!  What the heck!  I'm still not sure if it was the fried eggplant or the fried tofu that was so freaking hot, but something on that burger came straight out of the fryer and onto the bun.  Way too hot to serve!  Bachi Burger is lucky I am not the litigious sort.  When I finally got to eat the burger, it was good.  I especially liked the bun, and the veggie patty part was really good and housemade.  I think it would be just as good without the fried tofu and eggplant, so if you're counting cals I'd order it without.  Price on the veggie burger could come down a notch.  Service was adequate.  They were really busy at 7:30 on a Friday night.",

Sadly, we just got there at the wrong/peak time. A family that came in about 50min after us was seated only 10min after us. The waiter wasn't very attentive.

    "text": "Flies and (possible) case of mild food poisoning.  Well, originally I would have only taken off a single star for being too cheap to serve Coke, and instead having Pepsi. I've personally never heard a customer explicitly ask for a Pepsi, but I have seen people change their drink order from Coke to water, once they are informed apologetically that the restaurant only serves Pepsi. I've never understood why owners would consider saving a couple of bucks a month more important than giving customers what they want.  As for the food itself, it was very good. I also found the pineapple ketchup to be unique and very tasty.  The real problem was that the place was full of flies! It was pretty difficult to enjoy my food while defending it, and myself from the flies. It was pretty disconcerting when one actually flew into my ear! I noticed that I wasn't the only customer spending his time trying to swat the flies away. When the waiter came by to ask me if I needed anything, I told him that I could use a fly swatter. Apparently, judging by the smirk, he either didn't get the not so subtle hint, or couldn't be bothered with trying to fix the problem. Upon leaving, I noticed that they were doing work outside on the chairs. Most likely they couldn't be bothered with closing the back door.  Of course, this was only a mild discomfort, compared to the stomachache and three hurried trips to the bathroom a few hours later. Without expounding too much about what was happening to my GI system, I'm pretty sure the food gave me a mild case of food poisoning.  I'll not be returning to or recommending this restaurant.  Maybe this is the real meaning of, \"bachi\".",

    "text": "So I recently completed my 2nd trip to Bachi, this time with the ever-popular Gordon H, and while the restaurant didn't change much, it turns out that my opinion did. When I originally sat down to write this update, I thought my overall impression had not changed from my first review, but, as I was writing, things developed a little differently.   Food: This time I had the \"That's Cheesy\" or whatever they call their grilled cheese. It sounded awesome on the menu, but in practice it was maybe so-so. There was a pretty good amount of cheese, and it was made well enough, but it just wasn't very tasty. Without a veggie burger on the menu, this is pretty much the only meat-less entree choice - so I definitely couldn't bring a vegetarian here. Gordon had the Kikis, and, after an initial wave of too-much-garlic, found it to be enjoyable.   Service: The service was better than Yelp might lead you to think. Adorable Waitress was not serving many tables, which is probably a good choice for Bachi overall, but definitely not as far as I'm concerned. Consequently, we got Generic Asian Waitress. Her service was rendered adequately, but only adequately, and totally devoid of any charm. Say what you want about the flaws of my precious Adorable Waitress, but I'll take the more flawed service that comes with some personality over a technically-superior but totally bland serving automaton. Especially at a small, independent restaurant. Which brings me to:   New conclusion: Bachi totally needs to up their game. Yes, the burgers and fries are pretty damn good. Yes the food is unique. But the decor is generic and effectively-identical to the numerous Asian restaurants we have in town, the service goes from simply horrible to presentable but lifeless, and the prices aren't exactly cheap. I already find myself bored with the menu after 2 visits, and there really isn't anything else about the place that makes it attractive. One reason I prefer independent establishments is that they FEEL LIKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT!  Something other than the faceless ownership and bland environs of Chain Food Hell. And when an indie place falters, aspects like cheap prices or awesome service can bolster them. But Bachi lacks nearly all of the positive traits of a small business. Personality? None. Bargains? Zero. Service? Conspicuously lame. So that leaves the food. And while it's admittedly good at Bachi, it's not *that* good.  PRO-TIP: Another for the establishment. MANAGEMENT: Take a page from your competition and BE PERSONABLE! You're a brand new restaurant that only gets by with word of mouth AND you have a unique concept....so why isn't the owner or manager greeting customers when they walk in or sit down, introducing himself and the concept for the restaurant? Not only does it help to better sell the place, but it makes it easier to give you the benefit-of-the-doubt when something goes wrong.",

The kalbi burger is by far my fave...the kimchi and spicy mayo...yummy.  I also love the $3 pickles as a starter...and they have boba.  Awesome!  I probably go to this place because although some of the servers this is their first job and need a little coaching they are supernice and its open til 2:00 am most days so another plus on my list.  We live in Las Vegas, the 24 hour place, but too many place close way to early and if you go to eat around 9:00..whoa bad attitude people.  This place is nice too, cause you don't have to trek thru a mob of smokers and bright little machines to get there.  Told you I love this place. :)  My only wish is that they mix up the menu a little more with more specials to suit the season and local ingredients.",

When our guest how is a professional chef mentioned that he thought the crab might be spoiled, Kelly the waitress ignored us after that. Nobody acknowledged our complaint in any form, then we saw Kelly drop a utensil on the floor, pick it up, and proceed to deliver it with the order to table.  She also had the hostess deliver the check to the table--I guess she didn't have the nerve to face us again, after the complaint.  It wasn't her fault the food was rotten, but it was her responsibility to deliver the complaint.",

My wife had the Mr. Miyagi which was smothered with onion rings and was excellent as well.  If you think you can't do anything new with onion rings, think again. They were incredible!  The place was packed but never lacked in service. They REALLY need to open one of these in Seattle.  Best burger I've ever eaten!",

I got some with my burger and it was enough to share between 3 people. They have some really good beers here on the menu but the one the waitress suggested they were out of, and the next one she suggested they only had 1 left of. Also we tried to use the Yelp check-in offer which is buy 1 beer get 1 free and apparently you can only use it late at night. They did finally let us use it however since we mentioned it to the waitress when we ordered and she didn't say we couldn't use it until the bill came. I got The Crusty Crab and was so excited about it because it was supposed to come with avocado but there wasn't any on it. Same with my friend's. My other friend had The Banh-Mi Burger and she loved it. We were celebrating my birthday and they gave us free Portuguese Doughnuts with Coffee Gelato. I can't wait to go back and try the Kalbi Burger and Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. One thing to mention is the Windmill location isn't that big and we had a long wait on a weeknight.",

There was a 15 minute wait because the place is quite small, but it was worth the wait. Burgers were very big and delicious! Cooked exactly as ordered. My \"no meat\" burger was an odd sounding combo of flavors- barley, tofu, eggplant, walnuts, etc, but it was the best vegetarian burger I've ever had. Onion rings were great but salty. Fries were decent. Our only negative was the overly loud club music they were playing at 2 in the afternoon on a Wednesday. My son has been asking to return all week, and he might get his wish!",

We ordered the Bachi pickles for an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised of the presentation.  Two small oblong trays of different items - cauliflower, beet, cucumber, and other  assorted veggies but the best was the garlic.  It was soaked in some teriyaki sauce or Yoshida's Gourmet Sauce and it tasted sweet not like a garlic at all.  I could have eaten a whole plateful of those. MLML ordered the Kiki burger which he devoured and i ordered the steamed duck sandwich or a version of the hum bao or manapua.  We were both very satisfied with our meals and the specialty dessert. The service could have been better - they forgot a salad and seldom filled our drinks. That was the first time we were there... I had to bring down the rating to 3 starts because the second time we were there, MLML ordered a burger with blue cheese which was not tasteful at all and I switched to the steam sandwich with the pork belly.  The pork belly had too much fat in it and I had to separate it.  Service was so-so.  Pickles were still great! I would go back to try the last steam sandwich option with the short rib.",

Upon walking in, we noticed that there was plenty of seating around, so we didn't expect to wait- and we didn't. However, the host sat us at the first table, right by the door, crammed against the wall with a view of the host stand. Um... So, we asked if we could be moved. We were, to the back of the restaurant. Only slightly better. This wasn't going well... The whole seating situation there is a bit of a CF, though, all of the \"booth\" dining is WAY too close together, which we found out when a group of rather large individuals were crammed right next to us (and as a reminder, there were plenty of tables available).  Okay... lets move past that. The service overall was fine enough, although we ended up having two servers because one took his break while we were dining.   The food.... Not bad. The truffle parmesean fries were delicious! I ordered the \"Kiki's\" burger and was overall pleased with it, it had a lot of flavor, was juicy, and I loved the bread, but the sweet onion marmalade overwhelmed the burger. I could barely taste the mushrooms, and couldn't taste the egg or cheese at all.  So, all in all, it was pretty close to a 2 star review, but I'm feeling a bit generous. I don't think it is worth a revisit, though.",

It's like a fancy cousin of a barbecue pork bum.   Kiki's burger: all I can recall of this one was enoki mushrooms. Patty was juicy and flavorful.   All the food tasted good, seething to try if you're looking for burgers with a twist. Prices aren't too bad either. Burgers range from $11-26",

    "text": "I've been here a few times now and Bachi has not yet disappointed.  If you wanna come for a premium burger that tastes even more awesome on an egg bun, do come and check out Bachi and try it out.  For me, it's been the Miyagi Wagyu burger for the win each time...but the last time we were there, one of the servers told us that the burger that all the staff has and swears by is the miso wagyu burger...he said to definitely try it the next time we come out there.  And as an added bonus, they joined up with the ramen joint a few months ago and now serve both on their menus.  I come here for the burgers, but you know me and my love relationship with ramen; so of course I tried it out too...just the tonkatsu though.  The broth wasn't as tasty as I had expected, but the chasu was prob one of the best I've had...nice and fatty and super tender.  If you can split it amongst your group, I'd definitely go for it.  The fries: sweet potato, truffle, oxtail, and regular, are all awesome, and DEFINITELY can feed more than one person, as we learned to our doom the first time we came in and each ordered fries.  The oxtail is quite heavy so you might wanna split the burger...but then again, this is vegas, INDULGE!!!!  This place can get absolutely packed, which is a sign of the good food, the popularity of the burger, and just the fact that Bachi rules!  So I would come at non-peak times, which is hard to determine for Vegas, Thursday night at around 10 the wait was 40 minutes, Saturday around 9:30 the wait was 5...so it really does follow along with the vegas theme of just gettin lucky.    PS - there's a new bigger spot also about 15 min away from the strip...but with traffic, can actually take much longer to get to, but if this place is too busy, at least you have a second option.    Staff - Great!  Esp with the recommendations and the good humor.  Thanks Bachi! :)",

I like to put it on the burger and dip it as well.  Truffle Parmesan Fries-(Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle Porcini Cream, Sun Dried Tomato Aioli) Delicious and one order is big enough to share!  Atmosphere- They usually get busy in the evening so be prepared to wait. This is a pretty small restaurant considering their popularity. The decorations and creative and give a nice vibe to the restaurant.  The total for two burgers, one order of fries, and two drinks was about $30, not bad!",

I know he said something about one of the items being featured on some tv show (who cares just bring me food)  Ordered our burgers and some chili fries. The chili was very sweet and the I fries where very salty, if you ate them at the same time it worked but either one by themselves was not good  The burger (angus) was very bland and slightly undercooked (medium) no char to the outside no seasoning in the burger just plain beef cooked halfass add two half strips of bacon for $2.50 and it had no flavor at all didn't get the slightest hint of bacon over the bland burger the bun was very light and fluffy, might have been good but it was coated in some oily goo  My wife ordered some lichi (spelling?) drink she said it was bland too no real flavor her burger was ordered with some spicy sauce and jalapeno slices neither had much flavor so she asked for hot sauce and was given \"chili water\" waiter said it was made with ghost peppers again no zip finally the brought some shirachi sauce but by that time she was over the place  Good points  Presentation was nice, food was plentiful  Cons  Slow service, tooo noisy, bland food, over priced and NOISY One drink two burgers one chili fries $50 ----- ouch",

Its a must.  Super easy to find - rent a car - few minutes from airport - worth the drive.  Easy to park. But remember this is a very popular location by tourists and locals. Might be a wait for seating - but its worth waiting for. Top notch.",

I saw this place a few years ago when it was coming soon.....Soooo, we walked in this place, and you couldn't even get to the host to put your name on the list for a table.   Ok so, we finally made it to him put our name on the list.  They told us about 40 min wait!  Wow!  Come to find out, you can't call and make reservations, not good!  We decided to just order to go.  Well that was still a 40 min. wait.  We ordered the fried chicken appetizer, My husband ordered the Ronin Burger uummmm, they kept the egg though!  I ordered the Crusty Crab, Truffle fries and salt and pepper fries.  I loved the Chicken appetizer, it was so good, but with all the dipping sauces, I wasn't sure what was suppose to go with it.  I did try all of the sauces with the chicken.  Again, not sure which one was suppose to go with the chicken  I loved both fries the truffle one was different, but it was still good.  I really liked the salt and pepper one.  It had jalapenos and cilantro on it,  what a nice touch.   The Ronin, we ordered well done....we didn't get that, it was medium well!  If that were my burger, I couldn't have eaten it!  When a customer ask for well done, we don't want to see any red!  So due to that I didn't even get to taste it.  My husband was ok with it.  He said it was not bad.  Except he would have also left the coleslaw off.   So on to the Crusty Crab...I'm not use to mushy...If you like your crab crispy....I would pass on this one.  It was mushy....I wasn't expecting this to be mushy.  It was eitable, but I think crispy is better.   I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Try something else, unless you don't mind mushy.  The employee's seemed like they were stressed out!  It was crazy busy, and this is a Wednesday night.    I would hate to see it on a Friday or Saturday.  I think if I go back, I will call ahead, and only get it to go, the host said it's busy all the time!  Great for them, but I don't like to wait like that.",

I ordered a cider but it was bottled and seemed like just a selection from the supermarket and not really chosen to pair with a food and for specific qualities of the cider itself.  I got the kalbi burger and it was perfect top to bottom, the flavors worked perfectly and was just an awesome burger.  I order some fried but wasn't too jazzed about this visit's selection (truffle fries), but I'll chalk that one up to my choice.  My last visit had a better fry selection.    Overall I'm a fan and glad they have a couple in LA.  It's a great burger spot off the strip and not a far drive away.",

I have never been so disappointed with service until tonight's visit. I was asked what I wanted to drink and I said water. Few minutes later the bf got his soda, but forgot my water. We were sat right next to the kitchen, so it was hard to miss us. Servers, busser, hostess, and managers passed by me all the time. They saw me not having my drink on my table. I work in this industry, and I know how hectic it gets during busy hours, but to not even drop off a glass of water!?!? I wanted to wait until anyone noticed that I haven't had a drink in front of me for more thank half an hour. Unfortunately, no one noticed. My burger finally came so i just asked the food runner for my water. Seriously Bachi Burger?!?! My burger came first than a glass of water? Guys, train your staff properly or your business will go down as quickly as you went up. If I was a secret shopper your business would have been in deep trouble. I have seen you guys grow since you opened, and I am very disappointed with the service. The last time we were here my bf wanted a milkshake. He waited for his shake longer than I waited for my water. As we were almost finishing up our meals the server goes up to us and informs us that they're out of milk. Our recent experience here really reminded me why we do not dine here often. Guys, step up your game! How can you mess up something so easy like water? Tsk tsk Bachi Burger! :(",

My friends have raved about it, my fellow Yelpers have raved about it, so when I had a burger craving, I drove across town and gave it a go! And I was not disappointed!  We started off with the pickled appetizer. It was light, different, and delicious. My favorite was the pickled garlic. Divine! Some of the other pickled options were alright, but the garlic blew my mind.  I got Kiki 's Burger which had a carmalized onion, bacon marmalade and two types of Asian mushrooms. It was great, but the way the patty was put together was odd. It had a sweet taste to it. It was odd, different, and good. I just wasn't expecting a sweet burger.   I paired my burger with the Truffle Parmesan fries. They were delicious and crispy. What I didn't like was that the truffles and Parmesan were all pilled on top of the fries instead of mixed all the way through.  Of course, being the foodie I am, I had to try a dessert. I ordered the Portuguese donuts, with Vietnamese Cinnamon, and Coffee gelato.  The donuts that are dusted with cinnamon is a divine heavenly combo. It's melt in your mouth delicious. I would only order this is you are a coffee fan because individually the items are okay, but when paired together, your socks will be rocked off!  Bachi Burger was inventive, fun, and reasonably priced. The inside of the restaurant was clean and their was adequate seating. I will definitely be back to try more Bachi amazingness!",

We arrived a bit early and wondered if they were open for lunch as early as 11:30??  When we opened the door, we were pleased and surprised to find it PACKED!!  We were shown to a table, and studied the full, varied menu!  And we only had one opportunity to eat here on our trip! Shoot!  Our waiter Blade was extremely helpful, and at his suggestion, we ordered two burgers and split them, so we could each try several.  We had the Ronin and the Miyagi-san, along with the terrific sweet potato fries.    OMG.  Seriously.  These were THE BEST BURGERS WE HAD EVER EATEN.  I was so sorry I could only eat one.  They both had the most amazing taste, they were moist, flavorful, and absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!  I cannot explain how amazing they were.  The fries were very good, too.  No doubt about it - whenever I will be back in Vegas, I WILL find a way to have a meal at Bachi Burger.  Have I mentioned they were AMAZING???? If you're in the area, you will NOT regret a visit to Bachi Burger.  Now if only they would put one in San Francisco!!",

Perfectly and evenly good and excellently complimented by the condiments. Must try.   Had the Ronin burger; it was superb. Perfect combination of sweet and savory. Full of flavor without being too rich to finish. The bun was fresh and nicely toasted, the patty was charred and delicious while still juicy and cooked to my specification, toppings were on point. Literally nothing to complain about.",

    "text": "First off let me say that they have a remarkable parking lot, which is where we waited for about 40 mins to get seated, the anticipation I had was that of waiting for a ride at Disneyland, I was mildly disappointed. By the way it looks like a starbu&* convention in the parking lot with the fancy cars and the few overdressed people looking to flex their culinary lack of taste or perhaps they are just herd follower's I don't know, didn't ask either way there is a slightly pretentious feeling in the air there.    Ok, on to the table and food, let it be known that their service is EXCELLENT!, their server's are great, even if the flamboyant gentleman did forget my saracha hot sauce lol. They were quick almost instantaneous with the pre dinner drinks, which came out almost as if they had somebody behind the corner who already knew what we wanted, appetizers took about 10 mins, and they would have been worth a 20 minute wait, all of our guests reported they loved the appetizers, in fact one said he would just forget the burger and order the chicken appies and the fries for pick-up and head home, they were that good. NO compaints there at all. * I cant express how great our waiter was, and their staff even tho he did forget my hot sauce request*  They give SUPERIOR customer service.     About 15 mins or so after the appies came out our main course ala burgers arrived, in all their pretentious arrogant glory lol, with their glossy buns and spike stabbed thru the middle, initially I thought \"so this is what those perfectly presented and prepared commercial burgers look like in real life\", they looked like Hollywood props, very shiny, looking it over I had to chuckle lol, I ordered it well and it was cooked perfectly once again, if anything they are consistent here, the burger was too sweet for my tastes, it didn't deliver the punch to the palate that I was expecting but it was very OK, nothing stood out at me or there was nothing singular ingredient wise I could say I liked about this particular burger, you know eh, it was ok, it looks way better than it tastes. I cant honestly give a superb recommendation for this place because it just wasn't worth the price, its a 6 dollar burger at best with a 15 dollar presentation. Yes it does look great, but for all that flash it needs more bite. I've had better at local pubs for way less. The truffle fries were on a 1-10 scale a solid 8, very tasty as was their chili fries.      Maybe its the hipster crowd herd following thing that makes this place appear better than it really is, or I guess people just have mediocre taste buds but Bachi burger didn't do it for me, cant say that I will return unless its for appetizers to go....  Get out there and eat Vegas , explore and report =) be well.",

We ordered parmesean truffle fries to share and the Portugese donuts for the grand finale.  Can I just say that I literally drool thinking of these burgers. It was so yummy and not at all heavy. I ate the entire burger and I didn't sit there and go \"uuuuhhh..I'm so full..my tummy hurts!\"...nope...I just had that smile on my face and I was ready for the donuts to come with....and those little sweet fried balls of heaven were awesome...a perfect compliment to an awesome lunch. I wish I lived closer to Bachi Burger so I could try all the other delicious burger varieties but alas, I will have to wait till Vegas calls me.",

    "text": "I went to Bachi Burger because my co-workers were giving me a going away luncheon there. Service wasn't bad because we got there right when it opened. It started to get  busy after we left, so I can't say much after reading the other reviews about the wait.  Looking around the place, it looked like a modern, asian burger restaurant. The menu had very interesting creations. I was indecisive in choosing what to get. I had the lonely bird & we all shared the truffle parmesan fries. The fries were good w/ the sauce.  My burger  wasn't the best. They were reasonably priced considering they were gourmet burgers. All the burgers looked very appealing as far as having a great presentation goes. The lonely bird is a turkey burger w/ a teriyaki flavor. I guess I wasn't too fond of what I ordered. I like turkey burgers, but this is the first time I had it w/ an asian twist. I decided to try it just in case it was good. You never know, but at least I know now that turkey burger w/ teriyaki flavoring is not for me.    One of my friends let me try her burger. I think it was called the black & blue. It was good. My bartender ordered the Crusty Crab & devoured it in like a couple mins. He said it was good & he would come back again. Everyone else had the Ronin & Kiki's burger. They all seemed to be enjoying the meal. I was enjoying the meal because I had great company. It was nice that they let us take group photos in there.   I thought it was cool that they had many different flavored & unique beverages. I had the Jasmine lemonade tea. It was rather refreshing. Everyone seemed to like the lychee tea.   The one thing I really didn't like about the establishment was when I had to use the restroom, their sink wasn't working. There was no water coming out. Hopefully they fixed this problem because it's a shame to be eating a meal w/ your hands & not be able to wash them prior to or after the meal.   I would come again because their menu is unique, but maybe I'll wash my hands before arriving the establishment & bring extra sanitizing wipes.",

They have Angus and Wagayu, cooked perfectly. The house pickles are tasty and different. The garlic was my favorite. I had the Kiki burger, with 3 kinds of mushrooms, bacon, gruyere cheese and ailoi sauce,  and other half had the miso burger with fried egg. Both were 5 star delicious and juicy. The house made buns were fluffy and light. I also had the Kumai cocktail of sake, vodka, pineapple, cherry and mint. Delicious...not strong, but good. The atmosphere was hip, casual and fun. The server was friendly and knowledgable about the menu. We will be coming back!  Secondly, to 'Johnny U', if you are in fact, sadly, a real person, or an imposter, which is even sadder: Your review bemoaning the supposed asian takeover of the food universe, and the pains of being a white couple 'weird'ed out among 'oriental folk',  stupidly demanding your ketchup and mustard to put on gourmet fusion burgers, the solution to your problem is simple... like you...just put on your big girl panties, tug on those Daisy Dukes you should have quit wearing in high school and drive on over to Burger King, because let me tell you, even In and Out is too good for you.",

We ordered off the regular menu. I got the burger with kimchee and it was fantastic! The patty is HUGE, kimchee was good (although I could have used some more spice), and the bun was fluffy and filled with air pockets ready to absorb all the yummy flavors of the burger. I ordered medium rare and the patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare. This seriously hit the spot for me. The BF got a make-your-own burger with lettuce, tomato and an egg. He really enjoyed his burger as well.   This is a great spot (one I often overlook because it's tucked away in the corner) and I highly recommend it!",

    "text": "I can't get enough of this place and let me explain why they deserve 5 stars!  Bachi Burger serves you the gourmet burger experience without the strip prices!  I can personally vouch for The Crusty Crab sandwich and the Ronin Burger. Both burgers are extremely filling by themselves and each have their own unique Asian flair.  You don't even have to be a fan of seafood or crab meat to enjoy what  The Crusty Crab has to offer. It's a great burger that doesn't have over powering flavor. Both the chutney and tartar sauce compliment the burger well.  The Ronin, where to begin... I love the fried egg and the angus beef is cooked to perfection. For $11 you get great quality ingredients and a filling portion size. The burger does have a sweet flavor however it's not overpowering.  Overall, this place is far from perfect and service is definitely not amazing and hit and miss at times... But for the value this place is great and I have yet to try a burger that I don't fall in love with!  Bachi Burger deserves 5 stars because they've got me hooked. Sure they're far from being perfect but they deliver on offering a quality burger and it's consistently pleasing.   If you're a fan of trying new burgers especially with some asian flavored you'll keep coming back, guaranteed.   The breakdown: (for what you pay)  Service: 3/5 Food quality: 5/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Plating/presentation: 5/5",

    "text": "The food is always great, spectacular really. The pho and burgers are eclectic and offer flavor profiles for anyone; wether they be foodies or people just looking for a good meal. The two star rating this location is getting is purely for service. We entered the restaurant and waited at least eight minutes for someone to seat us- the other couple up and left- said they had already been waiting five minutes before we even got there. Why have a hostess station but no hostess? Finally a third server came from the back, looked over at us, and then offered to seat us. We got our menus and we were then forgotten. The server had apparently seated us in a different server's section and not communicated this to them. The new server was very short with us, and approached the table to ask if we had seated ourselves. The other server came over to the table and explained they had seated us- it was only then we got to order. Ordered the wings (they are delicious!!!) and were told they were out. Okay, so we ordered calamari for our app, put in the rest of the order, and waited. TEN MINUTES after ordering, the server comes out and tells us they are also out of calamari. Our actual food came out and as always, it looked amazing (Hubby got the black and green- my burger go to is the lonely bird) I take a bite of my burger and something tastes off- there is a texture missing. Realize they left the onion rings off the burger, so now on top of everything else, the food was incorrectly made. Our server did come over to the table and promptly got some onion rings so I could put them on, but the only reason we put up with the wait and everything else was the food. Needless to say I don't think we will be going back anytime soon and I would never take my friends or family to eat there. The service is inconsistent and they always seemed short-staffed and flustered.",

The wait was longer than told, no problem. When we got seated, my chair was wobbly and I couldn't lean back, I switched it out, no problem. The glass of water he brought me was cracked, no problem. We ordered burgers and fries and got the fries first. They were good, shoestring fries. Then we waited and waited for our burger. Meanwhile people who came in after us had ordered, eaten and paid and were leaving and we still waited. Finally got the burgers and one plate had a hair on it. Now we have a problem. We waited some more for the server to come back to take it away and off the bill. At this point, no one wanted to wait for them to remake it. The burgers are delicious, just so disappointed in our experience this time. Will think twice about coming back.",

    "text": "With over 1700+ reviews what can I say that hasn't already been said?  The burgers are good and the service is sometimes hit or miss at times.  They do tend to get crazy busy on the weekends and peak hours but the quality of the food remains consistent, even on the busy nights.    Personally, I like to build my own burger and add bacon and the Point Reyes blue cheese.  I get that this is a fusion burger spot and I might be missing the whole idea, but I have had nearly all of their burgers and I really liked the Black & Green Burger minus the spinach - which seems to just all fall out anyway.  It seems to make more sense to people that I build a burger rather than say a \"Black & Green burger - no spinach\" because that seemed to confuse people.    Other things I would recommend at Bachi Burger: - Salt and pepper garlic fries - Oxtail chili cheese fries - And both pork and duck Steamed Bao sandwiches.  Try to time your meal here outside of the normal peak periods and you should be able to enjoy a good meal without a wait.",

    "text": "I FINALLY got the opportunity to check this place out!!!  As a passionate Yelper, I don't know why it took me sooo long to visit a place with over 1000 reviews with an overall rating of 4 stars.  To me, that sounds like a GREAT place.  A good friend called me to go to dinner and this place was a great choice.  I was stoked!  When we arrived, I found out the wait was 35-40 minutes which didn't bother me because it told me this place was popular.  The waiting area was a little small with not a lot of seating.  I was relieved to see that the employees were really quick about cleaning off tables once diners left so we weren't waiting very long.  Our party saw an area at the bar and decided to just sit there.  Total wait time, around 15 minutes :)  The place is a nice, quaint venue.  You have the exposed air ducts and lighting.  The walls were painted grey to look like concrete walls.  The overall feeling was a warehouse/loft look which ultimately made for a modern feel.  I love it!  The bar top was filled with very comfy stools, dark top with an opaque glass wall with different colors illuminating the bar:  purples, greens and blues.    When we first sat down, the bar top was not clean had a fishy egg smell to it. We ended up asking the hostess to wipe it off. BTW, the hostess, was soo sweet!  From the greeting to the dinner service, she was super attentive and really helped her servers out.  Top notch!  The bar server was also a cool guy.  I think he was definitely in a managerial role, he just had that aura about him.  I felt like he was from Hawaii.  He kept using \"brah\" when he talked to me, which made it feel like a family place!  Alright, onto the food!  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries for 11.50. I saw this dish featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and NEEDED to try it!  First of all, what an amazing and beautiful dish.  Start off with crispy shoe string fries, chili filled with shredded oxtail meat, topped with a garlic aioli, cilantro, sliced jalapenos and a  fried sunny-side egg. WOW, I'm in heaven.  This dish is savory, little spicy from the chili and jalapenos, packed with flavor. When you get this dish, you must first take a photo for Facebook, then break the egg yolk and mix everything together.  The yolk coats the chili and fries and brings the dish to a whole new level!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish :)  For our main course, we decided to get two different burgers, cut them in half and share them, so we could asses more than just one!  The first burger was the Ronin burger for $11. This burger was Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, topped with a katsu bbq sauce, miso type dressing and accompanied with a Yuzu citrus aioli.  This burger is my favorite of the two we tried tonight.  The burger was super juicy (make sure you get it medium done...only way to go!), the slaw offered a crunchy texture, enhancing the burger, love me some fried eggs in a burger so there's that.  The sauces really brought the dish together.  SOOO Good!  The second burger was got was the Kiki burger also for $11.  This burger is also made with a juicy patty of Angus beef.  What enhanced the burger were the sauteed mushrooms:  Shiitake, Enoki and Eryngii.  The burger also had caramelized bacon, Gruyere cheese, onion marmalade, arugula and accompanied with a garlic chili aioli.  What I noticed right off the bat was the super smokey taste of the burger!!!  Then you get a sweet kick from the marmalade.  This burger is packed with different textures:  crunchy arugula and dense chunks of mushrooms.  The garlic chili aioli really makes the burger a star, so do forget to use it!  All these burgers are held together by a Taiwanese sweet bread, super light and fluffy.  Soo good!  So I know my review was super long.  If you are one of the few folks that reads this entire review and finds it through the 1000+ reviews, I'm hoping that you're mouth is watering like a faucet.  You NEEED to get your butt down to Bachi burger and try their food.  This place is absolutely amazing and you will NOT regret it.  So what are you waiting for??  They're open late!!",

    "text": "I've visited Bachi Burger sporadically for a few years now and have highly enjoyed their burgers, oxtail fries, and ramen (after meshing with Shoku Ramen). I recently dined at the restaurant and was disappointed to find that Bachi Burger no longer lived up to its glory.   Besides the fact that our burgers came out more rare than what we ordered (medium) the service/wait was what let us down. Hard to enjoy your dining experience when your table seems non existent to the servers. It was a Friday night and they did seem busy/short staffed (I spotted about 3 servers or so) but when it takes over 15 minutes for someone to come by your table after being seated then 35+ minutes for your burgers to come out (basically raw so I'm not sure why the wait was so long - we were so hungry we ate the edible edges) it can really cause a damper on your meal. The taste was still what I remembered (great flavor) and the servers still friendly - just incredibly busy and not as attentive as we'd like.  My experience wasn't worth the wait for our food and drinks. Just because I know how wonderful they once were and can be I'm still hopeful for Bachi Burger. Maybe they'll staff heavier in the future and if I ever return, I should definitely choose to on a slower weekday afternoon.",

My favorite part about the burger was the onion rings on it. So crispy and delicate like tempura. Get the meat medium cooked. Not too pink but still very juicy.   The oxtail fries were ok...tasted like a very presentable chili cheese fries with an egg on top. Still good but nothing to die for. You also can't tell if they even put any oxtail in it lol.   Overall great experience and I would definitely come back for the burger!!",

Got the truffle fries on the side and a not stale black tea (might have been freshly brewed, I'm not fancy enough to know the difference.)    Service wait was about 7 minutes with a half-packed dining room and wait staff was very attentive.   My Shogun Burger was pure magic, everybit worth the high price tag, and the fries were crispy yet soft, also perfectly cooked.   This is the kind of establishment I wish was in my hometown.

Whenever we have friends and family in town, we know we can always rely on this place for great service and delicious food.   My boyfriend and I have friends visiting from Hawaii and decided to take them here for dinner last night. For a party of 5, we were immediately seated with no wait. To start, we shared the pork belly steam buns, oxtail fries, and truffle fries. I ordered the Kiki's burger (my favorite) and my boyfriend ordered the Banh Mi burger (his favorite). The food came out extremely fast and everything was delicious. Everyone enjoyed their food. With the burgers being extremely huge and filling, I had to get a to go box for mine.   We will continue to keep coming back again and again. I definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "Today... Philthy reviews....the burger place that makes good fries and that Miyagi burger...  Tebasaki Wings:  If you are from West Los Angeles, Gardena, Little Tokyo, or Rowland Heights, then you know about Furaibo.  The undisputed Tebasaki spot.  These wings are not even close.  They have a sweet glaze that laced each bite.  The crunch was there though and I do always like crunchy wings, but the internal dryness detracted from the enjoyment.  Miyagi burger:  Crunchy onion rings, bacon, fried egg and wagyu beef...I don't see how anything like this could be bad and it wasn't by any stretch.  It was juicy and tasty like it should be.  The egg combining with the beef and bacon was like breakfast in every bite.  The soft bun just embraced it and lent to a great burger experience.    Kids Chicken Tenders:  For some reason, these panko breaded chicken strips were freakin good.  My daughter massacres them but just eating the inside chicken and leaving all the batter, but we all ate the remnants which had tons of chicken left inside. They were oddly tasty.  Go figure.   Garlic Fries:  Fries with a garlic twist.  Fried perfectly and flavored to a tee.    Service:  This seems hit or miss at this spot.  I've read the 1 star reviews and saw service was the biggest complaint.  Not so much the food, but waiting and poor attentiveness/attitude were to blame for the poor experiences.  We must of came on the tail end of a bad day because we were not greeted for 10 min upon our arrival.  A crowd of 4-5 parties and dirty tables seemed to litter the restaurant.  It looked like they were overwhelmed and understaffed.  I can overlook this as I have worked in a restaurant but at least acknowledge people when they come in.  The server was good and talkative and apologetic for the wait/condition of the restaurant.  I appreciate gestures like that.",

    "text": "Tried this place that was recommended by my brother when we went to Vegas. We were seated pretty quickly since it wasn't too busy and our waiter was really nice in taking our orders.  In terms of the interior design, I really like the clean modern look this place has, with the dark wood wall furnishings and seating along a spattered wall gray background and the dining area for customers is on a black chair + brown table combos. I'm seeing this growing trend of this look at I definitely like it  Now for the food itself I got the miyagi-san burger and my brother got the spicy miso burger. We both tried a bit of the others burger and we also ordered truffle parmesan fries with a tomato aioli sauce. The fries were great, fantastic with the sweet sauce they served it with. The miyagi-san burger was extra juicy, made with wagyu beef and bacon, a fried egg, and caramelized onions. Full of flavor and definitely a moutful to eat. I especially preferred my brother's burger, the spicy mayo, as it had a classic American burger look, but with the added kalbi beef, fried egg and spicy mayo flavor, gave it a new asian and zany touch to it. It was definitely sweeter than he burger I got, I'll probably get that one next time for sure.",

We'll let me tell you...best decision ever made! Man, the burgers here are awesome. If you check out their menu, you will see that a majority of their burgers and foods are Asian infused. I ordered the kalbi burger which has some Vietnamese touches such as the kalbi beef marinade and the kimchi inside the burger. I also ordered their truffle parmesan fries, which were so addictive! Service was good. We didn't have to wait that long to be seated even though it was packed when we arrived. Staff were friendly and very informative when it came to the menu options.   There was a ramen restaurant next door that Bachi Burgers ended up combining with. Now you can order burgers or even ramen. What better choices could you have? Ramen and a burger! Amazing! If you're in the Las Vegas area, you have to give this place a try!! They have two locations, one in downtown Las Vegas and this one.",

However I went in the beginning of the year again and twice the fries (I usually order the garlic fries) were just soggy and not hot, and the fish burger, which I always loved, was too sweet. Also, it took too long for them to change out/or make the fires better (and they really were not) and then I ended up eating the burger before it would get cold. I did not change out the fish as I was too hungry each time to wait for both. Can anyone tell me if this has changed since, so I can go back again without wondering if it will be a waste of my time?",

When the check came I was charged $0.50 for it. - expensive burgers, cheapest is $11, and just for the burger, not with fries.

However, we were seated and checked on so many times, I didn't notice how busy they were. They were super friendly and quick.    I am going to be sad that a bachi burger crave is going to have to wait until I am back in the area.  I really hope they decide to come up to Northern Ca.

Before our flight back home, we had some time to grab lunch, so we looked up their website, and it stated that this location is open, and it opens at 11.  When we get to the restaurant, it was closed because they are cleaning for \"annual maintenance.\"  We were upset that we took an Uber from the strip, relying on info on their website. We didn't have time to go to another restaurant since our flight was at 1:30, so we told the hostess that. The hostess was extremely dismissive, never apologized and walked away. That upset us even more and we voiced our discontent at how she handed this situation. The rest of the restaurant staff responded to us by doing the following:  1) Telling is \"get the fuck out and never come back to Bachi Burger\" 2) surrounding my friend and I. (Btw I'm five feet tall). There was 7-8 staff members that surrounded me and a friend. 3) pushing my friend-yes, a busboy actually placed his hand on my friend.  4) videotaping us and flipping us off. 5) Lying to us about the reason why they closed-they are cleaning bc the health dep't shut it down immediately following an inspection held on November 16. Its not due to \"annual maintenance\"  There was no manager to mitigate the situation.",

At that time, I couldn't eat beef so I had to opt for either chicken or turkey and they're usually so dry and bland but the moment I bit into this chicken burger it was like my soul left my body.   Now that I can eat beef, I came back to try their beef burgers and it was just as amazing. I got the Miyagi burger and it was just a burst of heaven in my mouth.

    "text": "So the day's goal of going to Bachi Burger came to a conclusion after visiting our third location. The first was closed due to pest infestation. The second was closed with no notice on the door. The third was open and in close proximity to the strip.  Although that this review is for this particular location, it's hard to not let the unexpected setbacks and disappointment at the two prior locations spill into the review of the third location. However, this Bachi Burger was far from perfect. Service was not terrible. We were seated immediately (mainly because it was empty) by someone helping out in the kitchen. You could tell because she was putting together a dish and wearing latex gloves when she noticed us coming in the front door.  We ordered the spicy miso burger and the kalbi burger. They sounded appealing on the menu, but the fact that the menu was a printed and formatted Microsoft Word document was a red flag. The burgers came out shortly after we ordered. They were artisanal burgers but they lacked in balance of flavor. The spicy miso burger came with swiss cheese, which we substituted for gruyere cheese. However, we were charged as if we had swiss AND gruyere cheese on the burger. The miso flavor was a little funky, resembling an old miso soup. The burger to bun ratio was off, causing the bottom bun to get completely soaked and fall apart halfway through consumption. The kalbi burger had good flavor but again, the bun problem. In addition, the fried egg that came with the burger was cooked over hard, completely eliminating the allure of the runny yolk on a juicy burger.  Lastly, the most frustrating part was that it took about three times as long to have the server collect our check and credit cards than it did for them to take our orders and deliver our food. Looking over, the servers were just shooting the shit and clowning around instead of looking at our raised arm to collect the bill so we could be on our way.  Bonus negative experience for the Christmas decor reminiscent of a lazy elementary school teacher's bulletin board and no functioning lock on the men's restroom door.",

Got there a bit earlier than my friend that I was meeting so I put my name in for a table and waited at the bar. It took a few minutes to order but they were really busy and the moment the bartender freed up he promptly acknowledged me and got my drink immediately. I ordered a cucumber mojito. Yum!!! It was really yummy and made with Japanese cucumbers. I have never had a Japanese pickle so I don't know if they are typically bitter but the ones in my drink were so I avoided them after my initial bite. Trust me... Didn't stop me from sucking down the delicious drink whatsoever!  My friend arrived and we were seated. I immediately ordered the pickles as I have had them before and absolutely adore them. Now this isn't your typical dill pickle by any means. It's actually a variety of pickled veggies including watermelon radish, green onion, garlic, etc. Huge problem with this appetizer is that it's so tasty that I didn't want to share! We also ordered the truffle fries which were also extremely tasty but they came with a dipping sauce that didn't really seem necessary since it didn't enhance the flavor.  For the main event I ordered the Kiki Burger which was delicious but the bacon didn't make as much of an appearance as I would have liked. But then again, I'm a bacon whore. My friend got the Black and Green and was really happy with it. Our server was friendly and attentive. She also came back to make sure my friend was happy since she pretty much likes her burgers raw. We will be coming back for sure but I'm not sharing the pickles next time.",

    "text": "BACHI BURGER, PLEASE COME TO ORANGE COUNTY!  WE WILL WELCOME YOU WITH OPEN ARMS!  I PROMISE.  So like a majority of reviewers, I too became entranced by Bachi Burger after seeing them on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives.  Despite the fact that Vegas is pretty much my home away from home, I never got the chance to hit up Bachi Burger until recently.  I was staying off the strip during EDC weekend, and was hungry.  Quickly Yelped something and Bachi Burger came up only a few miles away.  Finally!  The stars have aligned!  Bachi Burger it is.    We got there around 3 pm, the perfect time in my opinion because the lunch rush was over but the dinner rush had not started.  The place looks pretty small from the front but is actually quite large once you explore inside.  It looks like it expanded recently.  Downside is that the bathrooms are single stall.  There were quite a few empty tables but they still had a slight wait, only 5-10 minutes or so.  Ken and I took those few minutes to glance over the menu.    If you are looking for a burger place with an Asian twist and a lot of variety, seriously look no further than Bachi Burger.  EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING sounded delicious!  Not just their burgers but all the other things they had on the menu, baos to bone marrow, it was like a nice spectrum of food.    We settled on the Kiki burger substitute Angus beef with Wagyu beef, the Ronin Burger and oxtail chili cheese fries.  Personally, I thought Bachi Burger had an amazing menu selection.  They were different than your other burger places because of their extensive menu.  The ingredients within the burgers were very good and complimented each other very well.  I will go into more details later but I have to say, meat patty wise, Bachi Burger was good but definitely not the best meat patty I have ever had.  I think what carries them is how unique and different their burger combinations are.  Oxtail Fries:  Order this!  Awesome starter dish or even the main dish, it was a pretty large dish and the fries came crispy.  The oxtail was tender and blended in well with the chili.  Ken asked why they called this oxtail chili cheese fries.  I picked up a piece of meat and showed it to him.  He seemed surprise that there was actual oxtail in the dish.  Kiki Burger:  It was an additional $3 to substitute Wagyu beef for Angus.  I did not taste much of a difference.  This burger has 3 different types of mushroom, carmelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade and gruyere cheese.  The gruyere cheese made it taste a lot like the Fathers Office burger from LA.  I did not really care much for this burger.  The many different mushrooms made it mushy and the gruyere cheese made me want Fathers Office.    Ronin Burger:  Now this...this was good!  Carmelized Onion, Japanese slaw, fried egg, katsu bbq, and miso goma dressing.  Everything went together beautifully, it was very good.  I only ate half of the burger because I filled up on the fries and ended up eating the other half the next day, still delicious!    I wish I could try more from their menu.  I am happy that they have locations in SoCal, but come on!  Expand to the OC, we will love you, I promise!  Just think about it?  Okay?",

    "text": "Lunch at 11:30 on a Friday. Still ample seating at that time but when I left a little afternoon there was a line out the door, so this is a popular place. Greeted and seated pretty promptly, but then the service went down hill. Way too long before I was greeted by my server. After my order was taken, another very long wait before I had my tea and place setting.   The menu was an extensive list of premium burgers as well as premium ramen. Ramen looked very tempting, but I opted for the burger. Ordered the house salad ($5) and the Black and Green burger ($16). For $16 you only get a burger - anything else is extra so this is a pricey place. The salad was exceptional. I ordered the Wagyu beef burger medium but it arrived well done - ugh. It was a beautiful burger, and it tasted good, but for $16 is has to be perfect as ordered, and this was not.   Glad I gave this place a try, but there are much better burger places with better food and better service for $21 of value. With better management and more attention to detail, this place could be very good.",

Cane back to visit.   Wasn't busy.   We were seated as soon as we walked in.  Things have changed.   I was aware they added the Pho side,  menu now reflects that.  But service was a little slow.   Slower rhan it should be when they dont have all rhe tables filled.  And i was sad that they had removed the chocolate lava cake I loved so much.  but I  was surprised even more that my favorite burger tasted not so great any more.  It lacked the great flavors and the egg was oveecooked. The salt, pepper, and garlic fries were just OK, not fantastic as I remembered  them.  And hubby was soooo disappointed when his medium rare burger came well done.  Instead of sending it back he ate with a smile because this meal was not going to ruin our vacation.  I wish we could do 1/2 stars, this would be 2 1/2 and not 3.  But I dont know if we'll be back on our next visit or try and find another burger place...",

I really enjoy Asian fushion bar food, so I had this place on my food wish list for a long time before my first visit here.   Since this place is super popular, try to come for an early lunch or dinner to avoid the crowd. You must order the oxtail chili cheese fries, this dish is perfect to share and is absolute perfection. I love oxtail, cheese, fries and fried eggs so this dish has my name written all over it! Get this, or you'll definitely regret it! For burgers, I've tried the Ronin, Miyagi-San, and Spicy Miso. My fave was the Spicy Miso. I enjoyed the others but found the Miyagi-San to be a bit too dry. I usually order my burgers well done, but I get them med well here so it won't be so dry. Don't forget to order a delicious beer to wash all this yummy goodness down, they have a nice selection.   Awesome place, and I always try to come here when I'm in Vegas! Can't wait to visit the new locations in So Cal! :)",

    "text": "* Bachi Burger had a very island vibe which made you want to bob your head. The workers were also very friendly and answered all the questions we had to ask.   * The \"burger\" was unlike any that I've seen before; it had no buns, or any typical qualities of a burger. The patty itself was okay, nothing to rave about, but the rice underneath was very unique tasting. It had a creamy texture and this tocino sauce to mix with it. (Tocino is a sauce that most Filipinos use for recipes) The burger came with the macaroni - typically found in Hawaiian restaurants. I normally don't like that style of macaroni so, like-wise, I wasn't a big fan of the macaroni. Although some may like it more than I did. The truffle Parmesan fries were amazing though. It had that slight sweet taste of chocolate and the beautiful cheese texture -- btw. I love cheese, so that was a plus -- sprinkled on top. This entire thing fed 2 people and filled us both to the rim. We were stuffed.   * Pricing were around the ranges of $20, but there were like 2 burgers that were $8; although, the burger I ordered was $17. The overall price for the fries and burger came out to be $27.   * Would I come back? Maybe, but not something I would probably say \"oh. Let's go to Bachi\", but just in-the-moment kind of drop-bye.   * Rate: 8/10 * Pricing: $$",

This southeast Bachi Burger location worked out conveniently and parking was easy to find since it's located at a strip center that  provided plenty of parking.  Since I had a late breakfast, I wasn't real hungry and opted for just the Kiki's burger - Angus beef, shiitake & eryngii mushrooms, enoki onion marinade, gruuere cheese and garlic chili aioli. The burger was perfection - cooked medium but still juicy. The bacon along with the mushrooms and aioli on the side was unusual but absolutely yummy. Service from my waitress was friendy and spot on!  Overall, I was impressed with my experience with Bachi Burger and I'm looking forward to returning and trying some other items on the menu!",

With burger joint so finding a place that had high quality meats and different varieties of their super important to be!   My husband and I shared the ox tail chili fries and they were GONE in two seconds! Fresh French fries with their special sauce and among ox tail chili, light cheese, fresh jalapenos and a sunny side up egg?! YES MA'AM!   I chose the Banh Mi burger and hubby got the miyagi-San burger! He loved his choice and I wanted to keep mine and picture frame it! The ingredients were fresh, the burger was perfectly medium and the nuk mam dipping sauce was sweet and savory!   Sides don't come with the burgers but for their prices around $14 each they were large in portions and super satisfying!   We didn't taste any beers on this visit but WILL BE back to sample some of their neighboring restaurants ramen and other menu selections including desert!",

    "text": "Terrible Customer Service, almost like it is a social experiment to see if they can give horrible service because the burgers are so good.    Bachi has unique and delicious burgers, but the service at this location is consistently terrible. I walked in with my wife and they tried to seat us ahead of some others who had been waiting. When we did get seated, we spent at least 10 minutes waiting to be greeted, menus clearly to to the side. Waiters just kept walking by, no recognition. We eventually walked out, and on our way out saw the larger party that had been ahead of us, still waiting to be seated, just staring at the table that they were told would be ready and in fact was. I do think Bachi was understaffed, but that's no excuse for no greeting. Usually I'm of the opinion that you go to restaurants for the food, not the service, but when there is literally no service, there can be no food. Try the other location.  As to our prior visits, the service has consistently been terrible. This location severely needs training in terms of service and, possibly, to hire more staff.",

When you only have 1 veggie option you need to make sure it is available!!!! I am so dissatisfied with this place  Giving them 3 starts is only for not running their business correctly.

First party got seated in 40 minutes after writing our names down while the other party waited outside anxiously. I was in the 2nd party. I was walking in and out to check on my friends and I saw plenty of tables leaving and clearing up. After like 20 minutes, I asked how long the wait will be and the hostess didn't know.  I see my friends got fries but no burgers yet. After another 10 minutes, we see so many EMPTY tables so we ask if we could get seated. We even pointed at the empty tables and they told us we will get seated when they were ready... 10 minutes later, we still didn't get seated and our friends that were seated earlier didn't even have burgers yet.   We all left and went to the Subway next door. What a joke",

Every burger just has so many bursting flavors from the patty to whats with the burger to their sweet bun.   I usually order the crabby patty, but its not in season. Sooo I ordered the kiki burger (angus beef, with eryngii mushrooms and caramelized bacon) with a side of truffle fries which is just as delicious. But what took me by surprise was the Mr. HO burger which I really need to order next time. Its the burger with a taro bun, I had a bite from my cousins and wow, amazing.   I genuinely love this place. A family own restaurant and great service. Came here when it just opened and ive been raving about this place so im extremely late on my review. Anyways, excited to have bachi burger open in LA, just hoping its just as good as the original.",

The amount of time it took for a kid's hamburger with ketchup only to make it to the table seemed to be as long as watching paint dry.   Now it's over priced hipster food that hipsters won't eat.",

I love the way they use Asian fusion style in their burgers. The flavors go so well.  I've tried the Ronin burger and Miyagi San burger. Both really good and comes with a fried egg inside. We also shared the Parmesan truffle fries. Tastes great but my only complaint is that the fries are so small. It's like we were eating the small crumbs as opposed to whole sized fries. No biggie. My dining experience was still so worth it because of the burgers. The food does take a long time to come out (~20 min) but it's definitely worth the wait. They're cooked to perfection.  Next time I would love to try the Banh Mi burger. You really can't go wrong with trying any of them!",

So now that the disclaimer is out of the way, onto the review.   Bachi burger are for those who like their taste buds to rome wild.  Bachi is connected via a door way to their sister restaurant Shoku Ramen. Which closes earlier even though they share the same space.   I started with Salt and Pepper Garlic fries. It's served with Jalapenos and a garlic chili aioli sauce.  This is great way to start off a meal. It's an explosion of tastes and it lights up your tastes buds begging for more.   Then the Miyagi-San burger arrives and I instinctively bow my head in a gesture of respect to this masterful burger.  After practicing my wax on wax off techniques (if you understood that reference you just dated yourself) I begin to indulge myself by bitting into the burger.  I enjoy a fried egg in my burgers and if you have never had an egg in your burger, Bachi is definitely the place to venture out of the norm.  Your mouth is challenged by the opposing textures. The hamburger bun is soft as a cloud and paired with the crispiness of the onion straws, all you can do is close your eyes and enjoy the sensory overload. At that point the flavors of the caramelized bacon and sauces kick in, and when you least expect it you are in a blissful comatose.   I recently tried the chili fries and it's an out of body experience. Don't be afraid of the ox tail and you will pleasantly surprise your taste buds. Bachi is not where you come to be conservative or play it safe. Be adventurous and you will walk away a happy camper.   If you want an amazing burger and avoid the strip, this is the place the come.  Since I work so often in Vegas, this is definitely one of my safe havens.",

We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries topped with a sunny side up egg that were off the hook but a tad bit on the salty side. Can't go wrong with all the ingredients but put together YUMM!  Ronin Wagyu burger: onions, Japanese cole slaw, fried egg and Katsu BBQ. Great burger with a Japanese twist and the buns seem like the bread used in a Chinese baked pork bun.   Miyagi Wagyu burger: another burger with Japanese influence. Fried egg, furikake, bacon and onion rings. C'mon that sounds good right?  Both burgers have some sweetness due to the sauces they add so they are a little sweet and savory. Kinda reminds me of the Fathers Office burger joint in Santa Monica, Ca. Gotta try when you come to LV.",

After we got seated,we were getting looks and stares from the kitchen because they reconoticed who we were, and they had some not-so-great reviews, so I just gave them a \"this is your chance to step it up from my last visit\" kinda smile.  I was hella hungry, so I ordered the following:  Bachi Pickles  Fried Chicken Appetizer  Bachi Fish  Fries with Pineapple Ketchup  (I shared the chicken, pickles, and fries with everyone; I wasn't THAT hungry!)  The pickles were very good, but my favorite were the pickled garlic cloves. The chicken was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. Bachi Fish was absolute perfection and the ketchup was addicting!  I even savd a little room for dessert because I wanted some White Chocolate Yuzu Gelato, but was sadly denied because they no longer have it on the dessert menu....bummer.  BB has definitely stepped it up since my last visit and has earned its 5th star...ALOHA!!!",

We had the fried chicken, oxtail chili fries, ramen, kalbi burger, and a few other things to share with a table of 4.  The oxtail chili fries were surprisingly sweet but still had a good kick. The kalbi burger was bomb and I had to eat it the next day due to the ridiculous amount of food we ordered (still flipping delicious).  The ramen was good but not out of his world. Good hearty portion that hit the spot.   It was so delicious that I returned to Vegas 2 weeks later with my boyfriend and requested that we eat here. I ordered the miyagi burger this time and it was amazing and definitely a good sized burger. Highly recommend and will return the next time I'm in Vegas! We were exhausted and hungry after driving 11 hours and there was no line and we were seated promptly.",

We were greeted and seated right away, which is a plus for noon (we came at just the right time - right after the restaurant filled up). We were started with waters to drink, which was perfect.  However, during service was not what it usually is - our server kept paying attention to one table, which seemed to be friends of his, he refilled everyone's water in his section, but mine (drinks refills are huge with me, and the fact that my water was empty and NO ONE refilled it definitely took a whole star away), and he didn't do a check back with us until we were practically done eating.   Once we were clearly done eating and I are most of the ice in my cup (see picture), STILL no refill and a few other servers walked passed our table, let alone attempt to pre-bus or offer dessert. Our server finally came back, asked if we were all done (no shit, Sherlock!) and we asked for our check. And still - no water refill!!!! The worst part about it is there was another server right next to us with a water pitcher, looked at our glasses and he walked right passed us.  I love the food here, but man this experience sort of ruined it for me! Maybe I'll have to check out the Bachi on the west side of Vegas?  Note: forgot to add a few things - burger was medium well, when it was supposed to be medium - the burger itself was not seasoned - oxtail chili cheese fries were 80% beans - oh, and didnt I mention I didn't get a water refill?

    "text": "Do NOT get the boba drinks here. All made w/ powder, nothing natural, tastes way too sweet and expensive! We tried the honeydew milk tea. Ick.   Ok having said that, the burgers were delish!!  Bachi is located in a strip mall. Nothing fancy. We came on a Sunday for lunch, and had to wait bout 30 minutes for a table of 4. We ordered the Ronin burger, Kalbi burger, spicy miso burger, truffle fries and onion rings.   The burgers were all pretty sizable and the patties were juicy and very thick! Very well flavored beef. I tried the ronin and the spicy miso first and I'm glad I did because the kalbi was VERY FLAVORFUL because of the marinade and the kimichi. The taste stuck a bit more in my memory then the ronin and the miso. But I thought all the burgers were delicious in their own way. The buns were nicely toasted too. The fries and the onion rings were good, with the onion rings being thinner and a little on the oily side. I really also enjoyed the sun dried tomato dipping sauce and the garlic chilli aioli. so addicting!   Service was pretty good. It took a little while for the burgers to come out, but it was worth the wait. The burgers were very satisfying without being heavy. Great meal off the strip!",

    "text": "AMAZING burger.  The kimchi burger, that first bite was FREAKIN amazing.  My burger with the egg and fried onions on top was not as good- DEFINITELY get the kimchi burger- it sounds weird, but it was delicious!!!!  It's the most unique (and best tasting) burger on the menu I think.  I actually ordered the pork buns which were disappointing for dinner, and after taking a bite of my friend's, decided to order a burger.  The pork for the pork buns was not cooked well, was super fatty (not as meaty), I would not get this again. The oxtail chili fries were good, but nothing extraordinary (couldn't taste the difference between oxtail and another meat), a nice way to start off the meal!  The Kimchi Burger- the flavor of the kimchi, plus the meat, with a slight sweetness, was soooo good, a MUST GET!!!",

The serve then gave me a container to put the sauce that I had already eaten out of with my half eaten burger. I told her there's barely anything in it. Then she said it extra charge, which I didn't mind paying for.  All she had to say was we charge extra. I told her I have no problem paying. So then she gave me a half filled sauce. I was then really upset. I felt like she acted like we couldn't afford the food. Bill was $95+$25 tips, as I walked out she didn't even say thank you. I wouldn't go back even if they offered a free meal.",

Our waters are always refilled and the staff are very friendly! The service is always a hit or miss because I have had a different server the 5 times I've been here.  Their food has been perfect every time. I love the kiki, ronin, and the spicy miso burger, they're a faveeeee :)))) I will never go to another bachi except this one and village square, the jones location sucks in service and food and serves soggy burgers!!! Please visit this amazing location on windmill :)",

Bachi pickles were kinda interesting... it  was like a mix plate of different types of pickled radishes and cucumber. Fun when they were added to the burger.  Garlic Parm fries were delicious.  the pineapple ketchup was delicious! pineapple sweetness and flavor infused in the ketchup - very tasty  Service: our waitress was very informative and patient, as it was our first time visiting Bachi burger.  Gave us some great suggestions.   Parking: plenty of parking spaces in a small strip mall.    misc:  came here early on a Saturday morning ~11:30am and didn't have problems getting a table.  When we left at about 12:30pm, there were lots of people waiting outside for a table.  Bachi Burger and shoku? ramen are right next door to each other, they share the same entrance door, and you can order both burger and ramen at the same time.",

    "text": "Coming from California, we have a lot of great burger places.  Being a fan of burgers, my sister, her friend and I decided to try out this place.  We're glad we decided to eat at Bachi Burger vs. pigging out at one of the buffets.  Why, you ask?  Because I dare to say (and a friend of mine will agree it is a bold statement) that if there is a Bachi Burger put in Los Angeles, this place will easily knock out my Number One burger spot!  We got the ox tail chili fries and the truffle parmesan sweet potato fries.  Hoo Lee S***!  The truffle sauce and tomato aioli on the sweet potato fries are fantastic, and the chili fries are amazing!  I needed to look for my mama because I needed to slap her; yes it's that good!  And we didn't even get our burgers yet!  The red velvet shake was good, but was not something that stood out (maybe because I was having a food orgasm with the truffle fries!)  The burgers were just as mind blowing.  I got the Miyagi-San burger that has a Wagyu beef patty, onion rings, fried egg, Furikake infused bacon and chili mayo.  Our friend got the Mr. Ho burger, with Angus beef, green onion, cilantro ginger, Hoisin mayo, Lup Cheng, Mizuna and mushrooms... ON A TARO BUN!!!  My sister got the Ronin that has Angus beef with caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, fried egg, Katsu BBQ, Miso Goma dressing,  and Yuzu citrus aioli.  ALL THREE BURGERS WERE FANTASTIC!!!  I almost needed to look for my dad now and slap him too, it's THAT good!!!  I must say we will now be coming to this burger place every time we visit Vegas.  As I finish up writing this review I realize I didnt get to critique the asthetics of the restaurant itself.  WHO CARES!?  If you are reading this and are in the Vegas area, get your rear to Bachi Burger and grab some bomb a** food!!!",

I was not in the mood for a burger AT ALL, but the second I looked at the menu I was sold.   Service was great, and everything on the menu looked so good it was extremely difficult to decide what to get.   I eventually (reluctantly) decided on the Kalbi Burger which did not disappoint. Kimchee is the best condiment on the planet IMO and having it on a burger was an awesome addition. (I've had it on hotdogs and it's also thebomb) My boyfriend ended up ordering the Miyagi burger and it had such a balance of flavors and the onion rings on there were seriously perfect.   All the buns on every single burger were fluffy and light and held up to the size and juiciness of the hamburger.   Also order the salt and pepper fries because those things are legit crave-able. So crave-able that when I got back to the bay I immediately went to the grocery store and grabbed similar ingredients and attempted to recreate them at home.   Stop at Bachis, order something, be happy.   Easily one of the best burger experiences I've ever had.",

I got to the restaurant and sat at the bar. The bartender was nice enough and got my name and even acknowledged it was my first time there.  i ordered the oxtail chili fries and asked what was a really good shake. The salted marshmallow  and caramel. Boom done. Kind of down hill from there. I was there right at 1 and there was not a lunch rush going on. i counted. I was very specific about the dish, the egg, scrambled. I have never ever ever eaten an egg any other way. Sorry Wylie Dufresne, I just cant.  Fries came out, over easy egg. I give it back and all that was done was the through it in a pan and just mashed it up and put it back on the plate. After seeing that show and watching the regulars next to me get the presentation and visual quality of the plate. I waste down. Also no silver ware.  I finished the fries and they were good, not great. i guess i wanted to wash them down with my shake that never came. I was done and about to ask for my check, when the shake came.  I have seen pics on line of what it looks like. it was not picture worthy. truth be told anyone that follows me or knows me on Instagram knows that my IG account is nothing but food and the restaurants i go to with descriptions of wha tim eating to the minutest detail.  I paid my check, left a tip for the effort and left. sadly, disappointed.",

We ordered the oxtail chili fries. They were good but not much better than basic chili fries you could get anywhere else. We also got the pickled veggies, which were good if you like that sort of thing. I thought they were delicious, especially the garlic, but the waitress said many people don't like it.  The burgers were the best thing. I got the Miyagi San and the wife had the spicy miso. Both were great. We also tried the vanilla honey orange shake and it was good. My only issue with the food, as I said before, was the price. It's about 25% more than it should be considering the portions.  The service was also flawed. Our server started out nice but didn't seem knowledgable. Then after we finished our food we waited over twenty minutes to even be acknowledged! We had to ask another waitress for a box. Then since we wanted a milkshake for desert it was like they got confused about who our server was supposed to be. They were nice but someone should have noticed us waiting that long.  So anyway, this place is worth a try. I would go back again if I got a discount or coupon, but I can't see being a regular.",

    "text": "I am a fan! I have heard about Bachi Burger forever and was happy to see it and when I drove by, made a U turn!  The way I judge a burger is by the flavor of the meat. I cannot eat gluten so I do not get to have the joy of a bun, so when a burger is seasoned well it is a pleasure for the palate. Bachi Burger does it oh so right that I did not miss the bun. I was in heaven. We both ordered the Kiki Burger, and I wish one would have tried a different one but I now have a reason to return! The meat,the carmelized onions, mushrooms and cheese was pure decadence. I give the server props for letting me know the sauce was not gluten free! That was a touch I truly appreciated. I also liked that there was extra lettuce to make up for the bun, it is a great touch because it is annoying to pay the same for getting less. It was just juicy and oh so good.  We shared the oxtail fries. They were very good and the portion is very large. In fact, half came home. The meat was tender, flavorful and a nice kick. It was too spicy for my Mom even without the jalapenos but I was happy to finish them off. Next time if I ordered the fried it could be with another side as it was too much food! I want to try the other fries as well, so I will be returning'  I hear it is busy all the time, so as far as service goes I suggest not going at peak service as it is not large, so one may have to wait for excellence.The concrete floors and high ceiling makes it a little noisy but that is also the urban vibe. We had one main server but several different servers and busses came by to make sure we were taken care of!  The is one of the best burgers I have ever had, 5 Stars!",

Very flavorful and perfect amount of cheese, don't mix the whole thing though, gets soggy quick!  Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger (Medium Done): You can really taste the batter of the onion rings in this one! Flavors are a good mixture and do not overpower .. tasty!  Service is great, but then again I went at 11AM when they just opened :P, plenty of parking available.",

Oh, I am so glad we waited the 30 minutes or so to get in here. We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, onion rings, a couple of Miyagi-San burgers and a Ronin.  I don't know about the Ronin, but my Miyagi-San was freaking delicious! And the oxtail fries were not a letdown. I cannot wait to go back.  The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because I wanted to order a drink from their menu that's behind the bar and the waitress told me that the menu was obsolete. Weird. Maybe that should be taken down?",

So, today, while choosing a place to eat, I chose Bachi over Max Brenner. Yep. Big mistake.   We ordered the truffle parmesan fries and salt and pepper fries. For our burgers we ordered the ronin burger and spicy miso.  We waited 30 minutes for our fries and after complaining, our waitress said she didn't know we wanted the fries to come out first. Wthh.... . She gave us the sauces free of charge which was nice of her. Even though ALL the sauces tasted weird and citrusy. I thought the pineaple ketchup would taste like the special ketchup at Umami but it didn't. As matter a fact it tasted like regular ketchup.  Our fries finally came out and I was disappointed with my truffle parmesan fries. The truffle sauce were drizzled lightly and only got on the first layer of fries. Our burgers came out looking so delicious! We both ordered rare. Taking the first bite of my miso burger, I could taste a slight miso taste and then just like that, it went away. And that was it. No other taste! From that point on it tasted like i was eating tasteless meat. The meat were tender but not juicy. I didn't even bother trying boyfriend's burger because he said the same thing about his.",

The Ban Mi, Kalbi and Kiki's burgers are very good as well. Their Yuzu aioli sauce perfectly compliments the sweet potato fries, truffle parmesan fries very tasty as well. Only issues I have, their boba teas are too heavy on the milk here for my taste..and beef patties are ground very fine here, but the texture has grown on me.  Service here is always spot on, maybe because we avoid the busy times.  Bachi Burger truly is outstanding and lives up to all of the hype.",

Those who I dined with opted for pork and chicken stating these options were quite salty. Whatever you choose, the bowls come packed with plenty to spare. You will definitely leave stuffed.

Unfortunately they do not do substitutes and charge which I did but still not good business in my opinion... The waitress we had was quite impersonal and rude... We would ask for something and she would roll her eyes and walk off. Other then that the burgers were beautif and delicious.  UPDATE: So since going here last night I have become pretty sick... I'm assuming due to that stupid pepper that some genius decided to put on an appetizer plate with the title Pickles! BEWARE",

The food was so sick i climaxed.....this server though needs a raise or some you rock free DRANKS. He seriously was slammed and gave epic service...I work downtown serving and I can juggle and I was impressed....thank you guys a zillion...I need and really wanna try those damn oxtail fries soon though....one thing I was Un happy about was my meT was way way over cooked for MR...",

We order three burgers so we could try, the pork belly bun, and the fries with gravy I forget its  name. We tried three different burgers all medium rare and they all came well. It was a total disappointment, I would have asked to have for it to me remade if the waiter did not look so pre occupied (ill get more to that later). I forget the names now but all the burger were dry dry dry and some of the flavors we surprising not in a good way. I love pork belly buns but these buns were sub par. The flavors didnt stand out anf not memorable at all.  Now let me get to the service.   They seated us really quickly which was great since they had only six tables occupied, one large table which was already eating when we were sat. It took them a while to take our order, get our drinks.  When the food came, the waiter disappeared, from our table I mean. The food came and it looked epic which made the disapoointment greater. I had to ask him for ketchup and share plates.  But then he left for awhile and I wanted to ask for utensil but he didnt come back until we were ready to leave. I didnt understand why the service was so poor when they looked like they had more than ample staff walking around, just not near our table. They didnt refill our waters and while we were eating, some lady in the kitchen was yelling or talking quite loud. Really unprofessional.    Will not be back",

    "text": "Oh Bachi burger, as seen on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives, it truly looked out of this world! But sadly, the experience was still on this world and I would rather enjoy Guy's actual restaurant (see previous review)  We arrived in Vegas on Saturday and came by just about 11:00am, their opening time, with already a packed house and waiting patrons! That seemed to be a good sign! The interior is simple, modern asian-esqu themed, bamboo and wood but it was a calming atmosphere.   Our waitress was nice and friendly, and gave suggestions on items  today we ordered the following:   Shogun burger: wagyu beef, unagi, foie gras, poached asian pear, miso butter and Yamamoto peach; overall, for $26 i think this burger is ridiculously overpriced.. the beef, (i have had wagyu before) was very bland and overcooked; the sauce around it was good however; the foie gras was virtually minimal and the unagi was gone in a bite; the peach was very interesting to eat first too though and sweet! the bun was fresh and soaked up the flavors nicely; overall, a 3/5 for the burger  oxtail chili fries: these were very good but could have been better; the fries were nicely cooked, chili was delicious! oxtail was tender and mounded over everything! the egg was as tiny as can be and gone in two bites; the garlic aioli was also not enough  pork belly bao: this came as three, and the menu stated it came with \"boiled egg, cilantro, scallions, hoisin bbq and vinaigrette; well there was no egg, no scallion and almost no cilantro...the sauce was good but overall definitely not a good boa  kale salad: this was okay...mom ordered this and I did not try it  chili fried chicken: this was probably the best dish of all; chili, garlic, ginger, not too spicy, juicy, flavorful, 5/5!  Overall, I think Bachi is kinda overrated, especially the original location i expected a lot more; MAYBE a return to the LA locations closer to home",

    "text": "I've attempted to come to Bachi Burger the last 3x I've been to Vegas and I FINALLY got to try it this last trip! There's always a long wait and now I can see why. The hype was real.   We started with oxtail chili cheese fries and truffle fries. Both made my stomach so happy. If that were the only things I got to try this trip I would've left completely satisfied. I'm pretty much a sucker for anything with a fried egg on top. The fries were crispy, the chili was tasty, and the sunny side egg just completed the dish. The truffle fries came with a brown sauce on top. I have not the slightest idea of what it was, but it sure added to my truffle fries experience.  Also on the list of things I ordered were pork belly steamed buns with the houses sauce on the side. The pork belly was crispy on the sides and had so much flavor! (I'm drooling again...) BF ordered the spicy miso burger medium. It was saucy and messy and just the way I like my burgers. My experience with burgers have always been... The messier they are the happier I am with it.   They also own the ramen spot next door and you can order ramen if that's more your craving. I can't wait to come back for more oxtail fries.",

Unfortunately, when we visited today they weren't serving ramen, which is what my wife was hungry for. As we further explored the menu and started thinking of other things to order we learned that they were also out of chicken wings, duck steamed buns, the chefs special burger and other items. We ended up not ordering off the limited menu and chose another restaurant for dinner.",

    "text": "Came here due to recommendations from my cousins who raved about it being the best place for a burger in Vegas. So on my way back home we drove by this place to give it a try.  We got here right as it opened, so there was no line to deal with.  A friendly and enthusiastic staff member greeted us and sat us down. He asked if we had ever been to Bachi Burger and when we said no, he did a quick introduction of some of the more popular items on the menu.  There were three of us and we got the following:  Truffle Parmesan Fries: ($5.50) which included  Parmesan Reggiano,  black truffle cream with sun-dried tomato aioli on the side.     - I thought it was decent. I didn't really taste the truffle flavor as much as I hoped for, and I preferred my fries to be a bit crispier.  I would probably pass on getting this the next time.  BBQ Bachi Burger: ($13.00)  8 oz Grass Fed Wagyu, lettuce, tomato and onion.   - This is the burger to get if you want a simple, juicy and flavorful burger where you let the bun and the meat shine. My friend enjoyed it thoroughly and didn't see the need for extra toppings or sauces.   Black & Green Burger: ($14:00) American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, sauteed mushrooms, spinach, bacon, Point Reyes blue cheese,roasted garlic   - No doubt this is a flavorful burger, just reading the ingredients makes you salivate.  My friend liked the burger and the combination of flavors. He said he would get it again.  Shogun burger:  ($26.00): Wagyu Beef, unagi, pan seared foie gras, poached Asian pear, miso butter, and a Yamamomo Peach palette cleanser.  - I got the ultimate flavorful and tasty burger I have ever tasted. Over indulgent, perhaps.  However, the flavors surprisingly work well together.  Granted I was in search of foie gras coming from California which has now banned the delectable item so it was a no brainer that I chose this burger when I saw it on the menu.  It is a very rich tasty burger and slightly oily, but that is a given. The foie gras was pan seared so it was soft and melted slightly over the beef so there was a lot of texture going on with the poached pear.   Our waiter came to check on us after our food was delivered and told me that I should have the \"Yamamomo Peach\" before I eat the burger as it is a palette cleanser to prepare your tastebuds from all the flavors before you bit into the burger. Just remember that there is a small pit in the marinated peach.  I can see that the Shogun burger is not for everyone, but I enjoyed every bite of this burger.  The menu if fairly extensive and has a little bit of something for everyone.   Our server mentioned they plan to open a Bachi Burger near UCLA soon and another place called Healthy Life Kitchen.  Why 4 out of 5 stars? Well, I was a bit disappointed with the truffle fries.   Service was fine. Parking is plentiful. Prices are higher but I suppose you get what you pay for.   I would definitely come here again if I was ever in Vegas.    p.s. I was tempted to get the oxtail chili fries, but my companions were less adventurous. Darn!",

This one in particular has a joint menu with Shoku Ramen next door so yeah, that's pretty sweet.

This was my first experience with wagyu...I felt pretty fancy eating my hoity-toity burger.  I dunno if it was worth the price tag but it was pretty good.  I kept getting huge pieces of peppercorn and having to spit them out...maybe other people like that but I didn't.   The pork belly buns....while pretty tasty I don't think they are worth eleven bucks.  Maybe if they were five bucks.  Hipsters will eat anything with pork belly in it.

Only thing I hold back on is they are pricy and everything is al a cart.",

The truffle parm fries were so good, but even better with the little orange dipping sauce. I like my fries thin and crispy so it was the perfect texture and crunch!  The oxtail chili cheese fries were pretty good. You can definitely taste the oxtail meat in the chili. Since I'm a fan of crispy fries, the chili soaks up my crunchiness.  great flavored and worth trying, but I like the truffle fries better.  I ordered the Kalbi burger which has Kim chee on the burger and it was DE-LICIOUS!  I'm a huge fan of Kim chee so I may be a little biased with this particular burger.   Being greedy, I also took a bit of the friend's burger, the Miyagi San, and it was quite tasty also! If you like onion rings, this is your burger.   And to continue being a fatty, haha, I also took a couple of bites of the KiKi burger with a fried egg.  BOYYYYYY!!!!!!! If you like mushrooms, this is your burger! The mushroom flavor in this burger is so strong and powerful, but not too much like garlic. I was so full from snacking on everything else, I still took another bite.    Each burger and fries concoction has its own flavors and ingredients. You wouldn't be able to taste the same flavors in another burger based on the items we ordered today. This will be a place I stop for every time I visit Vegas.   What happens in Vegas.......gets posted on YELP!",

    "text": "Ok it's about time I update my 2 star rating I gave them years ago. Being that I've been here and to the other locations a bunch of times.  Bachi Burger oh yeah I'm a fan of their burgers, not all of them, but enjoy most of them. Their kalbi burger is right now my #1 favorite at Bachi Burger. It's a little messy to eat, the sauce can go running down your arms while eating it if you're not paying attention but I can never turn it down. Kalbi in a burger how awesome tasting does that sound. Well it's more like a burger with kalbi sauce and kim chi but if it was kalbi short ribs it would be really awesome. Hope someone makes that somewhere soon. Always the kalbi is delicious. Sometimes I'll eat it so fast, cause it's messy, that I'm done before everyone else and I'm like do I order another one.  As always they have their oxtail chilli cheese fries which are excellent to share in a group. Their various burgers, spicy miso not spicy but tasty you should ask for some hot sauce. Not a fan of their truffle fries. You can also order their ramens, was gonna try it but again can never turn down an opportunity to eat the kalbi burger.   Customers service at most times are good but sometimes when they're too busy it seems like their overwhelmed, you no the usual.   I'll definitely be back. I'll try not to order the kalbi or spicy miso burger cause I need to try something else but no guarantees.",

    "text": "My boyfriend, Matthew, has been hyping this place up since I moved to Vegas a year & a half ago. And maybe that's why I was so disappointed with how my meal turned out...... and then again maybe not. This place was downright awful. And by awful, I mean I can't believe I paid for my food.   For so long I believed that presentation was everything, and then I started eating at places like Bachi Burger. Though artfully crafted, all three items I ordered were beyond bland and expensive to say the least. After doing some Yelp picture stalking, I ordered the Oxtail Chili Fries and Pork Belly Buns and requested that both be served as entrees instead of appetizers as Matthew and I like to have all our food at the same time so we can have a variety of items to munch on. My Oxtail Fries came out long before anything else, which was an annoyance, but nothing I was gonna raise a stink about so we proceeded to dig in.   My sweet Buddah were those fries disgusting. When I'm dining at a place that's charging $11 for a plate of chili fries, I'm expecting quality ingredients and exceptional flavor, and these fries lacked both. If I hadn't known any better (and I guess in some way I don't) I could swear they were covered in a can of Bush's Beans... and nothing else. Not even the fried egg that topped it could add any flavor to this disaster of a dish.  The Oxtail Fries were followed by my Pork Buns and Matthew's Miyagi San Burger that he requested to come out medium. Brown meat through and through is not \"medium,\" people. Yet despite the obviously overcooked hunk of beef, we tried our best to power through the rest of the meal, and let me tell you, it was rough. The grease from the onion rings on the burger was enough to give you a stomach ache and the \"Buns\" around my pork belly where gummy... literally.. it was like eating thick gummy candies with cold pork....  I asked our waitress what condiments they offered so that we might at least get something into our system. Matthew inquired about a sweeter dipping sauce, and she proceeded to tell us they had a pineapple ketchup. I don't care much for sweet things, so I asked what other condiments they had, and finally decided on a garlic chili aioli. Our waitress brought both dipping sauces to us, which I thought was a very kind gesture considering we only wanted the aioli... until she charged us for both of them!   First of all, if you are going to charge people for condiments at a RESTAURANT.. you need to tell the customer that there's an extra charge. Second of all, don't bring out a condiment that I didn't ask for and then charge me for it.  Matthew and I left all our food on the table and left. We won't be back.",

    "text": "This is not an average place, but the food was underwhelming. Great menu, including ramen. But execution not so much. And when the food is not up to par with price I'm stilled annoyed the next morning.   The $4 fresh squeezed lemonade nothing special, pass.  The pork belly buns, pork fat was not rendered well, left 2 behind. Bbq sauce served on the side is good but not needed. Not executed well.  The ox tail chili fries - hyped up wayyyyy too much. All the components are great individually but not balanced combined the way they were. Loved the fries and chili aioli but the oxtail chili was too all over the place. It needs some acid, smaller serving and a major price drop. $10+ bucks for that will piss people off. Also have you thought of a cilantro jalapeno aioli to go with the chili aioli OMG. That chili aioli is major.   Miyagi burger, too much going on as well. The patty with just the bun would be an all star burger. The onion rings were all star. I wanted a side of onion rings after eating what was in the burger. The candied bacon I see the concept but it's out of place and hijacks the flavor from everything else. But this burger needs some acid, some freshness. You got bread, burger patty, egg, bacon and onion rings. A tomato perhaps? Thin slices of fresh pickled daikon, something ...  We came because of diners and dives, it's one of the places you want to give another try ... but not trying to throw more good money after wasted money.",

    "text": "With locations now in California, there's no doubt Bachi Burger's popularity isn't dying down. With a couple thousand reviews, there's not much to add except that I'm a fan of the Asian inspired burgers with the extensive beverage menu. I just go in knowing that I'm going to drop a couple extra bucks and there will most likely be a wait for a table. You'll usually also find a drop off in service with increased wait times due to the high volume of patronage. But you're sure to find a burger with great flavor and a beverage to pair with it.  My favorite is the Kiki's burger which is basically a cheeseburger revved up with bacon, mushrooms,  sweet onion marmalade, and a garlic aioli. I would also recommend the oxtail chili cheese fries if you've got somebody to share them in order you not be too full for your burger because you polished off a whole order of fries on your own.  On our last visit, I had the Shogun burger with a Sam Adams Rebel IPA. Although I appreciate the combination of foie gras, unagi, asian pear, and miso butter combination, the wagyu beef gets lost. The pear was actually the most overpowering. I did think the yamamomo peach was interesting as a palette cleanser. If you like a little more simplicity with your burgers, I would not recommend this burger with a price tag attached of $26.  Bachi Burger will always be on the radar when we're looking for a unique, quality burger.",

We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries which was okay. However, the chili was pretty amazing. Meaty with a bit of spice. MMMM Everyone ordered an item off the burger list but since I'm not a huge burger fan, I opted for a specialty sandwich which I feel that they don't advertise much of. I ordered the Lonely Bird which was large enough that I was able to save a bit for dinner. I was also able to try a bite of the ronin burger which I would recommend if you love eggs and fried things lol.",

Appetizers Edamame with garlic butter and truffle oil - yummy, my fingers were so oily from it but soo good ahha Edamame with garlic ginger and chili - I don't like spicy things and it wasn't that spicy but I didn't like but my friends did Out of the sea salt fries with pineapple ketchup, garlic salt & pepper fries with garlic chili aioli, and truffle parmesan fries with sun dried tomato aioli, the truffle parmesan was my favorite, something about truffle that just makes it soooo flavorful and tasty mmmmm  Burgers  Most of my friends got the ronin burger which I cant speak for first hand but they loved it My bf got the bachi american wagyu burger - which was freaking one of the most expensive but he seemed to enjoy it a lot saying the quality of the meat was really good. He was actually savoring it and eating it slowly instead of scarfing it down like usual... or maybe he was getting full from the appetizers? I wanted to try the crusty crab but unfortunately they took it off the menu :[[ so I got the grilled bachi fish which was yummy! The only bad thing about it was that since its cod and the fish was flaky (in a good way) the burger didn't hold, it pretty much fell apart, so I had to eat my burger with a fork ahah  The server was nice and pretty attentive, constantly filling our waters and taking away plates pretty quickly.   We left happy, definitely will be one of our stops when we come to vegas",

Oxtail chili cheese fries- sweet, and savory oxtail goes really well with the crunchy texture of the fries.  Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage- it was just ok. Pork Belly Steamed Buns- although pretty fatty looking but it just melts in your mouth, the hoisin dipping sauce is too salty for my taste, should be more on a sweeter side. The Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger- very good, soft and light sweet buns compliments the burger perfectly. Shogun burger- a monster burger with foie gras, unagi, and pear.  Overall a very good restaurant, will definitely come back to try their other stuff on their menu.",

I have to thank my two friends, Rob & Steph, who finally got me that elusive visit to Bachi! It's not located too far from the strip. But definitely an area I had never even traveled, even living here 7 years. Inside, it had a nice clean, look. They were fairly busy for lunch, but the wait wasn't terribly long, 15-20min. There was 3 or 4 burgers I wanted to try but I suppose I'll have to return to try them all hehe. I decided on the Spicy Miso Burger. I believe my friends had the Bahn-Mi & Wagyu cheeseburger. We also shared the oxtail chili cheese & truffle parm fries. My burger contained onions, shishito peppers, roasted garlic, swiss cheese, apple vinaigrette, a fried egg and spicy miso sauce. I loved the sauce. Little spicy, the subtle savory flavor of miso. And can't argue with a fried egg on any burger or sandwich, at least I wouldn't haha. Great burger. The oxtail chili cheese fries were also awesome, although it did cost twice as much as the other fries. The truffle parm fries I couldn't really taste any truffle. The Ramsay burGR truffle parm fries were definitely alot better. Service was good from start to finish. I absolutely have to return to try more of their burgers!",

They're open late (often until 2 a.m.) and they're pretty consistent in the number of patrons inside (usually 70-80% full). The staff is friendly, and willing to answer questions. Burgers are also offered protein-style for those who don't want--or cannot--eat so much bread.  Their Truffle Parmesan fries are AMAZING, and a real deal at $4. (You can definitely share them among 2 people, but I'd get more orders for a larger group).  The sausage appetizer is tasty, as well; but it's only really for one person.  The only qualm I have about this place is their speed of service; it usually takes about 20-25 minutes to receive your food, so don't arrive starving. That having been said, this remains one of my favorite late-night restaurants in the valley!",

Joking or not still very unprofessional.   Anyway onto the food .. Tried this place once before when it just opened and wasn't impressed .. Thought maybe we just ordered the wrong thing ? So it got some hype with it being on triple D and with the reviews I figured I'd try it again. Still Not impressed .. Oxtail fries nothing special and for $11? so not worth it .. I'd rather go to California hotel and get a big bowl of oxtail soup with rice for $10 ! I'd stand in line too for an hour and give them an extra $5 for tip ! Also got the Ronin burger .. Again it was OK .. For $10 I would rather them give me 3 of the buns only .. That was the only thing that was good tonight .. Also it's a bit pricey total came to $27 for a burger n fries .. i should've went to In-N-Out with the $7 and put $20 on black at southpoint ! Overhyped I think .. Nothing to go out of your way of .. I'd go here only if McDonald's wasn't 24 hours or if fuku Burger ran outta business .. But we all know that's not happening anytime soon",

At bachi, I tried their miyagi burger, and each bite was full of flavor. The bun was toasted to perfection and for some reason, the juicy richness of the meat never left the buns soggy (twss).

The managers and/or owners are waaaaaaaaay understaffing their floor at peak times and it hurts the experience, which would be perfect if not for the service issues.  We started with the pickled vegetables -- revelation. A nice mix of Japanese veggies that calmed the appetite but didn't fill us up. I've had both the Ronin with beef and with the chicken patty (for reduced guilt.) I loved it with both, awesome flavor combo. The fries are special. Truffle parmesan is spectacular, sweet potato not far behind.  Beware the hard sell on the drink menu, both alcoholic and non. Looks like that's where they make up for the reasonable prices on the food menu. If you want a drink, there's a great selection of sodas, beers, wines, etc., but it'll run up your bill in a hurry.  Servers are friendly and helpful, but just stressed out by being stretched too thin. There were two for the entire floor at dinner a few weeks ago and they were running for their lives. For the sake of the experience, please staff up, Bachi!",

The selection of fries they have are insanely addictive.  The truffle Parmesan fries are my favorite.    The other surprising twist is that this is also a ramen noodle shop.  The ramens are pretty authentic and reasonably priced.  Others I have been there with get ramens, I stick with the burgers.  :)      They also do steamed Bao sandwiches.  The pork belly Bao is to die for.  This place is always slammed so expect a wait for a table.  The food is not cheap and borders on expensive but the quality of the food you gets makes it worthwhile.    The service is bonkers considering how small the place is and hailing your server can be a challenge at times.   The bouncy and interested nature of the staff far outweighs how busy they are.    If you have friends coming to town and want to show them some off strip Vegas goodness, you can't go wrong with Bachi Burger!",

The service was so slow, I got annoyed! Again, it took them several minutes to greet and sit us.....  Esteban took our drink order and I came out in a pretty good time.... then we ordered....slow..... when we got our first order which was the Ox tail fries which were delicious!!! Ox tail stew over a plate of fries... the sauce, meat mixed with the fries was great! However, when we received the fries, we didn't get plates or napkins, or utensils.... COME ON!   And I ended up getting all those things myself.... then our burger came which was the kikis burger which was good BUT OVERCOOKED..... I asked for medium rare but it was well done.... but we were so hungry after the flight, I just wanted to eat.... and I even informed Esteban and was hoping for a nice gesture (like a small discount, complimentary fries or drinks) but nothing.   We also ordered truffle fries and it was really good! Nice flavor and the fries were hot!   So there was good things but the service really needs to step up.... but One employee Steven was consistent and worked hard and he actually took over to take care of us... and he actually was pretty good.... but the team needs improvement.",

We had stopped by Bachi Burger around 6pm before dinner rush hour and were served by a very nice and helpful gentleman who was accommodating to any questions you had with the menu. I had ordered the Ronin Burger and I really enjoyed it, The burger was cooked to perfection and everything really went together on this burger. The slaw and dressing were tasty, the yuzu citrus aioli really added something to a burger ive never had before, with a lime flavor to it, my only gripe is that the fried egg was a little overcooked, which is fine because thats what a fried egg is but I like when it is a little runny, (I suppose I should ask for it that way). Along with the burger we also shared fries, which were average.  I think next time I stop into town I will definitely come back and try one of the other creative burgers this place has to offer.",

Service was a bit slow from waiting to take our order, waiting for the food, and even waiting for our server to run our bill. It seemed like it was dying down a bit after we got there and picked up when we were leaving.   I decided to build my own burger. The descriptions of the other burgers sounded overwhelming for my tastebuds and I just wanted something simple since it was my first time here. I ordered a medium wagyu patty with an egg, gruyere cheese, and the onion marmalade with the regular fixings. I got to say, the onion marmalade really exceeded my expectations. I asked for it on the side because I wasn't sure of it yet, but I pretty much smothered it on my burger.   Would definitely come back again and try their specialty burgers this time.",

Both sounded great on paper, but both were disappointing.  Garlic fries were dry and sprinkled with light garlic. The aioli sauce that came with it was good, but nothing special.

The highlight of the meal was the fries so if you go there definitely order some garlic fries (the sauce is comes with is also fantastic). The burger was good, it had a hint of a korean flavor to it (like a kalbi marinade) and I enjoyed it. The salad was really nothing special so I would pass on that.   Service was excellent and the crowd was young and hip. Really enjoyed and will be back soon. Thank you Bachi Burger!",

The waitress was very friendly and checked back on us just the right amount of times (you know. Not too many where it was annoying, but just enough to know they're still keeping an eye on you). The food was excellent. We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries to start off with. When it came out, hubby and I demolished that plate in about 5 minutes lol. This was our first time getting anything with oxtail in it. And it definitely didn't disappoint. The flavors on that plate were excellent with just enough spice, esp for preggo me. He ordered the ronin burger, I had the kiki's, and little one had the chicken karaage. Omg. Even after the chili cheese fries and my burger, I picked off a couple tiny pieces of the chicken just to taste. And boy, talk about light and fluffy breading haha. Everything we got was good stuff. Great service and food. Definitely coming back to try the other burgers and their ramen!",

Wait was tooo long, service wasn't too great, drinks weren't good, it got quite smokey in the restaurant... the only thing they really had going for them was the food!   We came here on our way home from vegas. Yes we could've gone somewhere else when we heard it would be an hour wait, but we decided to stick it out, because if we had gone anywhere else, it would've been the same.  I was referred here by a co-worker.   We had the Oxtail chili cheese fries, which we alright, you don't really taste the oxtail, it's a bit sweeter, than just regular chili fries.   We also had the Waygu and Black & Green Burgers. Which were delicious! I have to say the best part of our experience here. The drinks were watered down. Even though it wasn't that busy by the time we got our tables, it took a while for us to get our servers attention.  Even with the vents on, it got really smokey inside the restaurant too.   Overall it was alright, would i go back? Yeah, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",

    "text": "We had the oxtail chili cheese fries with egg, Miyagi-San and the Shogun burger, along with Portuguese fried donuts. My beverage was the lychee milk tea with boba.   I think if you advertised oxtail chili cheese fries the \"oxtail\" should be the main focus. In this case it wasn't. What we got was barely-there shredded oxtail meat in a stew of chili smothered over fries and topped with an egg. The chili was good for what it was but the oxtail meat did not shine.  The Miyagi-San burger was very flavorful. I liked it an would probably get it again.   The Shogun burger had interesting and complex flavors. I don't think any one thing really shined. I could've have done without the poached pear. It sounded good on paper but it was just over-kill. The meat patty had a sweet teriyaki sauce and that was plenty sweet on its own. The frois gras was an interesting touch but it had the same texture of the poached pear. I'm not sure how frois gras is traditionally cooked but I would've wished mine was cooked a little more firm and salted more to counter the sweetness. I honestly think the burger was a whole lot of \"too much\". Frois gras... Unagi... Poached pear... Wagyu beef patties... All wonderful on its own and maybe it should be enjoyed that way. I wouldn't pay $26 for this burger if I can enjoy one of their $13 burgers just as much if not more.  If you're accustomed to drinking milk teas and boba. I would say the lychee milk tea was sub-par. If the idea is new to you, it's a cool thing to try but KNOW there are plenty of better places out there to get the same thing.   Our food came out extremely late and our server was very apologetic and comped our drinks and dessert. I was appreciative but unfortunately that was my first experience.",

    "text": "Heard about this infamous burger joint first from one of my co-workers... then as I scoped out the scene here on yelp it totally made me become even more interested in visiting this place... finally during one of my recent trips back to the city of sin I was able to make my way out there to confirm the verdict... and guess what?  It's definitely a thumbs up!  So what is Bachi Burger?  It's a similar concept to Umami Burger that is based in Las Vegas...  Let's jump right into the Pros and Cons... (My new ways of reviewing...)  Pros:   --Great burger!!!  Had the Kiki Burger and it was off the hook!  The size is as big as expected from a gourmet burger joint so nothing special.. it comes a la carte so your fries will always be an extra order on the side... --Great truffle parm fries!  Terrific flavor and definitely deserves a recognition! *totally wanted to try the Oxtail chili fries but didn't get the chance...  The neighboring table ordered one and they literally killed it in about 3 seconds... can't wait to order this entree next time I'm visiting LV!  Cons: --Location is not too hard to find but it's not obvious either... ample parking though... --Price is definitely on the higher side.. oxtail chili fries will be around $11 bucks so be prepared to pay for the food... for us one burger, truffle fries, and iced tea ran around $20... so it's definitely a treat more than anything... --Not on the strip where I'm usually at.. but I guess that's ok... less crazy crowd I suppose.  Verdict:  I will definitely go back!  In fact... my next trip I'm going to verify how delicious that Oxtail Chili Fries really is... and gotta try the Miyagi Burger too!  So stay tuned for an updated review coming soon!",

We started off with some adult milkshakes, which were strong but delicious.  For burgers, we had the bbq burger, the kikis burger, and the miyagi burger. My friend said the bbq was good but nothing spectacular. My husband had the miyagi which was savory with lots of flavors. I had the kiki which was suggested by the waitress, and it lived up to its reputation. It was huge, but I finished every last bite because the burger and dipping sauce were amazing.  In addition to our burgers, we also had the truffle fries which were cut thin and came with a spicy dipping sauce. If we are ever in the area, we will definitely come back.",

But eventually, tasted everyones burger at our table. everyone had something different and everyone couldn't stop raving about their burger.  i think my favorite was the miyagi san.

Again, service was much-improved so they get five stars this time because the service was excellent and the crab cake was the True five star surprise.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Today was the second time we ate at this place and I'm still a fan. For a Saturday mid-afternoon, it was pretty busy. The place is pretty decent, good for intimate 643-8 people. The servers were really friendly.  I introduced my friends to this place and each one of us got the Ronin burger. Perfect serving size to not overwork the kidneys. Although, I was bummed that when I requested to cook the eggs over-easy, the chef said no. That would have been delish! The yolk oozing out....I know.. weird.  The truffle fries were ok. I know right? Chocolate + fries = hmmm..Something I still need to get used to. Also, try the hot green tea. Will definitely aid with digestion:). The bf was the only one that ordered the Kiki's burger and he only ate half; he was definitely FULL which is rare.  The first time we ate here, I got the Kalbi burger, which is also yummy but I prefer the Ronin burger.  Oh, and if you crave for this place on a random Saturday night (midnight-ish) come early or ORDER ASAP! When we called last Saturday, they ran out of buns due to high volume! We were pretty disappointed last night and settled for In & Out.",

I would recommend the karage chicken as an appetizer, which is something I cannot find in most restaurants and the dipping sauce for the chicken is excellent.  As for the service, I thought it was good.  I have read some reviews where service was a concern.  This was not the case on my visit.  It was a very good dining experience.",

    "text": "Ok after a lot of ranting and raving from other people, we decided to try Bachi Burger. I understand that they are trying to be creative with their Asian fused food. Great concept, however, some times a little too much can be a bad thing. Overall the place was ok but not what I was expecting. I suggest this place if you want a nice atmosphere and finger foods, not if you're terribly hungry or if you have several mouths to feed since everything is a la carte. If on a budget, stick to Fukuburger.  First comment- nice interior and atmosphere. Steady flow of people. Employees were nice. Even though there were other patrons, we seemed to wait a long time for our food. I believe we waited at least 20 mins to get our food and another 15 mins for the check. I mean for a burger this seems like a long time plus there seemed to be a quite a few employees in the back that it shouldn't have taken this long.   Second - the food. We ordered the parm fries, Ronin burger and Short rib steam buns. Parm fries were good however I didn't feel that the sun-dried tomato aioli really fit in with the fries. If anything I would suggest that the truffle sauce replace the aioli because the sauces didn't go well in my opinion. Also I didn't think the aioli had much flavor considering it was sun-dried tomato.   The Ronin was just ok. First I'm surprised they didn't ask us how we wanted it cooked. It came out medium well and honestly I would have preferred it a little more pink. First off, the burger in my opinion is quite small and tries to compensate with a thick patty but still looked delicious that I couldn't wait to take a bite. First bite, bread is soft and great quality of meat but the sauce tends to overpower the flavor of the rest of the ingredients. If you asked me I wouldn't have been able to tell you that there was Japanese Cole Slaw, an egg, caramelized onions or a miso dressing, all I could taste was the katsu sauce. There were 2 sauces on the burger and a citrus aioli on the side. Personally I don't think the aioli or the miso dressing are needed since the katsu sauce is powerful enough by itself.  Short rib steam buns - great presentation making it look like pitas. However, first impression was that's alot of dough for the little bit of ingredients within it. First bite is exactly what happened. I thought that the short rib and the egg didn't have enough flavor to overshadow the thickness of the dough. I could taste the cliantro but other than that, I thought the flavor was very bland. I tried the dipping sauce which was suppose to be a horseradish aioli. Personally I wasn't a fan of it, I would have preferred something with a little more zing like a wasabi ranch dressing or a japanese style salsa. It's a great concept but I think it should be revamped to bring out the flavors of the ingredients they try to fuse together or else again everything gets lost in what is trying to be accomplished.  Finally we ordered the Portguese doughnuts. Eh it was just an oversprinkled cinnamon mini-doughnut with a mini vanilla ice cream scoop. It tasted a little burnt and seems to be covered with alot of cinnamon and brown sugar to hide the burnt taste.   Overall Bachi was just ok, it didn't meet the expectations that I had or maybe I had too high expectations. For two people we spent over $40 and still left hungry so I wouldn't recommend this place if you are starving. Again I like the concept and what they are trying to achieve but for the price I can get the same thing at Fukuburger.",

    "text": "I live in Summerlin so this place is a good 30 minutes away from me.  When I was finally on that side of town my friend and I decided to check it out!!  I was honestly expecting a little burger joint like in-n-out or something, but this is a nice sit down restaurant.  Casual and trendy.    My friend told me what to order so I didn't even really need to look at the menu, but I was intrigued by their \"Burgers with a twist of Asian fling\" deal.  There are so many things I want to go back and try, this will definitely not be my LAST time! Our waiter was also very informative. He asked if we wanted to \"hear about the menu\" and I thought he'd never shut up... He explained EVERYTHING to a T.  I actually felt bad because I was already ready to order before I even got a menu!   We started out our meal with the pickle plate.  I had no idea what it was but we saw it in a newspaper article that  was posted in the front.  My favorite part of the plate was the pickled garlic cloves.  I was expecting way too much garlic flavor, but wow I was surprised.  I would get a bowl of just that!!  The other items were mediocre, but it was worth trying it.  Very interesting idea!   For dinner I had the Kiki's burger with sweet potato fries and sun dried tomato aioli.  It was delicious!!  The burger was amazing.  It came with a chili aoili on the side and that was actually my favorite part.  Next time I want THAT for my french fries too. My friend had the crab cake burger, and it was good!  I like it a lot for a seafood burger.  It was a little sweet which was odd to me, but very interesting flavor.    I ended up spending $17 for a burger, sweet potato fries and the pickle plate.  Not TOO bad, but a little pricey for 1 person at a burger joint.    HOWEVER, I would go back in a heart beat.  I actually can't wait to return so I can try something else!  Definitely check it out, you won't regret it....  The drink menu alone looks amazing.  I drank water, but next time I'm gonna have to get one of those boba milk teas everyone was drinking.",

    "text": "Wow, JUST WOW, who knew heaven was just a few files from the strip of LV...A stop I will always make in Vegas...it's just that good. I just had it 2 days from this post and I wanted it again and tried to hit it up before I left the sweet town of LV, but damned it all they are closed on Sundays, DRAT .   Let's take this as a walkthrough, I'd like to be how very detailed in the whole experience.   1. Walk - in, little worried b/c even with good reviews I've seen from yelp that it wasn't that busy, also the few customers we did see didn't order burgers but sandwiches.  2. The Sit Down. It was a nice looking decor, just arriving to LV and was starving anything seemed good, but I didn't know what I was about to get into. We order some waters, get them fast because it wasn't that busy considering it was around 3 PM, We order the fries, sweet potato, the truffle oil, and garlic fries. They come out first.  3. The fries. The Garlic fries were the first I tasted, each basket of fries come out in nice decor and although it's 4 $ each approximately for a little more than a handful you'd expect to get more, but it's really the perfect amount you need. Again well the garlic fries were great, they had good taste, and had a little kick of spice I would think from jalapeno. It was really awesome! Second I tried the Sweet Potato fries, which were cooked to the greatest form...the texture and crispness to the fries was really good. Then I tried the truffle oil fries, by themselves I thought were alright, but when you add them with the sauce / chutney that is arranged with each basket, it definitely does not disappoint. 4. The Burger, Oh goodness....the burger...it was just amazing...I ordered the Kalbi burger, and was actually reluctant b/c the waitress didn't really acknowledge it as a good choice...or even ask how I liked my burger cooked (I ususally get medium-rare, or medium), but it didn't matter...it just didn't...it was just that good. My burger had a perfect bun, wasn't soggy or anything, it held True form as I devoured my burger from first bite to last. The patty! Man if you've had Korean BBQ / Kalbi, then you know that's already money, but on this marinade on the patty! SOOOO GOOD!!!! It also had a thin layer of Kim-Chee and served with a side of pickled cucumber (ouee kimchi, is what I think it's spelled), I wish I could describe it better, there was more to the burger...but I just totally just hypnotized by it's taste.  5. Service, I know it wasn't crowded but service was amazing, it seemed everytime I sipped water, someone would fill it to full right after I put it down. The staff was nice, give you a warm greeting and a happy good bye b/c I think they're glad to see satisfied customers, and I was most definitely one of them.   This was the longest post I've ever written, and even posting this on my FB just to spread the word on this place...",

Once we were seated, our server came pretty quickly and was nice. That was the best part of our terrible service! Our server took about 10 minutes to bring our strawberry lemonade to the table and after waiting over 20 to 25 minutes, we received our food but never received out appetizer. When we mentioned it to our server, he said that he would get it put in right away. We opted not to get it anymore as we had seen many other tables that came in after us receive multiple things before we received anything. Our server looked as if he was on drugs, very jittery as he attempted to show us his pad of paper showing us our order and saying it was not his fault. Mid way through our meal, we ordered food to go, we sat and waited for over 20 minutes and finally was approached asking if we have received our food. I proceeded to tell the other server that we were waiting for our to-go order. As he walked away, I saw him go up to the register area and find that our to-go order had been sitting in the counter. I could not believe how terrible the service was at Bachi burger! The food is always good, but I felt like the server should never have been serving people food! He made mistakes on every single table he was helping in our area and instead of apologizing, he made excuses!",

We ordered a variety of appetizers which included fried calamari, sweet potato fries, octopus fried balls which were all mediocre.  Nothing wow.  Then comes the entrees which included the tiki burger which tasted somewhat like the western bacon cheese burger from Carl's jr.  The garlic ramen was flavorful, but again nothing to get excited about.  Also took home an ordered to go, the banh mi burger, a Vietnamese inspired baguette that that now turned into a burger was nothing to really praise about after having the first bite.  For desert, we went with the donut and ice cream, again very average.    In terms of service, our server was nice; however, the attention to details was not there.   We were not given proper utensils such as knifes for our burgers and spoons for our ice cream.  Also our appetizers that was brought out were placed on our napkins.",

We all ordered our meal with our drinks so the server didn't have to come back, nervous she wouldn't. After an hour and 20minutes and no drink refills and a member of our party had to go back to work and left without eating., I asked to speak to the manager to see what the issue was, she sent the server to our table. With that, I questioned the server about the time and why it took so long. The server stated that it was out of her control on why the food was taking so long. I will NEVER go back! I can find better service somewhere else. I will NEVER recommend Bachi Burger again!",

Bachi Burger\".. \"mmm\" and all kind of positive responses ensued. Curious, I asked, what is this Bachi Burger and where can I get it. The reviews there and on yelp ended up being great, so we decided to make sure we checked it out before we left Vegas.   It did not disappoint. First, we ordered the oxtail fries. Yes, I know it sounds strange and not necessarily appealing. But wow! It was really good! The fries were not soggy, the oxtail super tender and they added a fried egg on top. And I really really love a fried egg. Got to try the garlic truffle fries and those were good too. For the burger, I tried the Ronin burger. I enjoyed the quality of the beef and the mix of different and unique flavors. Friends also tried their shakes and really enjoyed them. Definitely a good find! I am excited to see they have opened locations in LA and Pasadena!",

    "text": "Bachi Burger, thanks for being vegetarian friendly! I really enjoyed my meal here last night with friends. They had two menus available for us to chose from: Bachi Burger and Shoku Ramen. I'm assuming that the Shoku Ramen place (next door) shared the same owners as Bachi Burger, which is why they had two different menus.   ATMOSPHERE Darkened lighting created an intimate atmosphere for friends and couples. Wood paneled walls and skylights made the space feel laid-back and upscale. I was definitely comfortable! It was busy and the tables are spaced far apart from each other so that you have lots of space to have private conversations and can talk loudly without bothering others.  FOOD Alcohol, Japanese appetizers & Ramen offered from next door's kitchen, and Asian-fusion fries and burgers were on the menu. They have a great selection and there are many choices of burgers for all types of appetites. Because I am a vegetarian who eats seafood, there were options from both menus for me! I also liked that they have the option of add-ins and an ample selection of sauces to accompany the yummy fries. Now onto mine and my boyfriend's selections:  1. TAKOYAKI (FRIED OCTOPUS BALLS) $8.00 Delicious! I love that their takoyaki had 6 bites containing lots of flavor, and generous toppings (bonito flakes, ginger, mayo, takoyaki sauce, etc). Could have been crispier on the outside, but the inside was cooked and had a good bite-sized amount of octopus (tako).  2. NO MEAT HERE BURGER (WITH ADDED SWISS CHEESE) $11.50 Had fried eggplant, shiitake mushroom patty, tomatoes, onions, a perfect soft bun and mixed greens. I think it had some sauce in there as well, and combined with the swiss cheese... You think being vegetarian is a curse? No. This burger is a blessing. If I wasn't vegetarian, I would've have tried it. So THANKS BACHI FOR MAKING ME NOT REGRET MY DECISIONS! Arigato gozaimasu!  3. VEGETARIAN MISO RAMEN (WITH ADDED BOK CHOY) $11.50 Good ramen, good (on the sweet-side) miso flavor. I don't know what their regular ramen broth tastes like, but I'm sure it's equally as good. It is missing a bit of a wow-factor though. But points for having vegetarian choices.  SERVICE Very understanding and patient server. My friend is one of those people that asks you lots of questions and takes awhile to order. Our guy server (with curly hair I think?) was patient, and explained everything perfectly. He even brought us our somewhat difficult water order, as we all wanted it \"hot\", \"iced' and \"room temperature\". I know, the customers we all dislike. But hey, we were accommodated with a smile, so brownie points for putting up with us! Also, more tip for you, sir!  Overall, good night. A little pricey for burgers, but they are well executed and delicious so no complaints here. Will be back",

My husband had the Spicy Miso ramen and I had the Kiki burger. We had the takoyaki octopus cake. The takoyaki is okay. There is one small octopus in it so I guess that is a plus point for them but I tasted better than that. I have to admit that the Kiki burger is good. It is good but not that extraordinarily spectacular.",

    "text": "One of the most reviewed and highest places to eat in Vegas, OFF the strip count me in! It was pretty busy for dinner, but we got a great table just a few minutes later. Service was nice, though they were busy, they got our order right and food came out quickly, The menu is very different from any other burger place, takes a while to take it in and narrow down the selection. For starters we had the chili fried chicken LOVE, so crispy, sweet and spicy, perfect! Onion rings and salt and pepper garlic fries, also excellent, piping hot and crunchy with great flavors, win! Kids meal, a great value at $9, full sized burger, fries and a side of fruit and veggies, score! I had the Caesar with Baby Romaine, Avocado, Tomato, Parmesan Reggiano, Organic Jidori Chicken Breast and Spanish Anchovy  Not a fan, basically a plate of cheese, killed the lightness and all other flavors, cold chicken and I tried my way through all of their dressings, liked none and just didn't eat the salad, no bueno. Much better was the No meat here burger with Wheat ,Red Bean, Shiitake Mushroom Patty, Japanese Eggplant , Mixed Greens, Tofu, Chili Lime Vinaigrette Basically 3 veggie burgers in one. The breaded eggplant I can do without, but that Mushroom patty was AMAZING! There was so much going on, so many flavors, so many taste buds that had never been tickled like that! My husband had the The \"Banh-Mi\" Burger with Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass Pork Pate. Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli Pickled Vegetables, Nuoc Mam Sauce and liked it though, all the different meats in one burger got to him after awhile.  Portions are not huge, but the flavors are so intense, that everything is served in perfect proportion. Can't wait to be back, something to look forward to next time I am in Vegas!",

The wagyu beef is well seasoned and the miso butter, poached Asian pear, and unagi tops it off. If you want to be adventurous and try something different, I definitely recommend this burger. All the components of this burger put together makes for a very rich and delicious burger.   My boyfriend got the Miyagi-san which was a little disappointing for the both of us. The patty was overcooked so it tasted a bit burnt around the edges which overtook the burger making it hard to enjoy.   FRIES: Our table ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, the truffle Parmesan fries, and salt and pepper garlic french fries. My favorite was the oxtail and salt and paper garlic fries. The truffle Parmesan fries were just okay but could not compare to the other two. The oxtail fries were delightfully the right amount of sweet and spicy, every bite was enjoyable. The salt and pepper fries just made my taste buds ring, the garlic chili aioli sauce that was paired with these fries was also great.   DESSERT: I got the Tahitian vanilla orange milkshake at the end and loved it! The orange aroma paired with the vanilla was fantastic. The milkshake was a satisfying end to the meal. I can't wait to go back here next time to try their other burgers!",

It's a little expensive but the oxtail is so flavorful. Best of all, the chili is not watery, which I hate!  Can't wait to come back. Or to go to the one opening in LA!",

I had the Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries and a Dogfish Head 22oz My Antonia Pilsner.   Everything fit together perfectly.  The burger was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing.  The fries were crisp and covered in jalapenos and cilantro with hawaiin sea salt and had a chili dipping sauce that fit together perfectly.   The beer was the perfect accent to the meal as well.  You can always count on Dogfish head.    Overall this place was great, service was great and I will highly reccomend to anyone looking for a great burger experience.   The prices I feel are good for what your getting.  My entire meal was $30 and change.     Bachi Burger is not too be related at all with fast food, In & Out or anything of that nature.  When you come here you are getting the sushi of burgers.  Nothing is spared in the pursuit of perfection to get you to burger nirvana.",

What can I SAY they truly are serving up a one-of-a-kind special burgers.  Not to mention all the side delicious - Ox tail fries hands down simply yummy despite the spicy green peppers floating around, not for the faint at heart.  Although I shared them with My guy who loves the hot spices and for me I just scoop them away. The Myagi-San burger, Parmesan fries, homemade burger buns (Taiwanese sweet bread)  it all Rocked! My banana bread pudding - oh my another home run!!!! My hubby truly loved it as well, In essence, you will not be disappointed and your palette will be submerged in a bliss of delightful flavors, that are heavenly paired together.  OMG! hands down the best burgers EVER - ONLY in Henderson! Now to wait another year before our return trip!  Too bad we didn't know about it last summer!  Bachi burgers you have spoiled us to the point of no return.  Ahhhh my mouth is watery with just the memory of my experience there.  By the way, the staff was right on point each time we return during our stay in Henderson - 3x. Delightfully surprising how much I enjoyed eating these burgers, with no recourse to my stomach.",

    "text": "Whenever you hear about \"high end\" burger joints you always have to wonder what and how they are going to be. Usually I think of In-n-Out or maybe Five Guys for a good burger, but now you can go and get a restaurant style burger for like $10-15. Bachi Burger is a joint like that where they throw the asian flair onto their burger in a fusion manner. I was a bit skeptical when I saw some of the items on the menu but when you try them out the flavor combinations turn out to be very good.  First we started with the oxtail chili fries - now for me oxtail is one of the best things ever, and when you combine it into a chili and then top it on top of fries with a sunny side up egg, you got a winner. It is definitely enough to share as an appetizer - we did for 4 people - and everyone got a taste of the flavor explosion.  Now there are way too many burgers to choose from, so our group of 4 decided to pick 4 different burgers so that we could all taste a little of each one.  We sampled the Ronin, Kalbi Burger, Spicy Miso Burger, and the Crab burger. We got all of the burgers medium rare (which is much better than the recommended medium) as the quality of the meat was actually very good. Overall, every burger had its own unique flavor combination and each of them I would have been happy with getting, but I was glad to share and try each one of them out. The Ronin had a japanese flavor to it, the kalbi as its name implies, had kimchi in the burger and actually went very well with the meat. The spicy miso was also very good and as I am a fan of shishito peppers chose this burger - it definitely was not \"spicy\" as the name implies and could have used something to give it more of a kick. The special burger of the night was the crab burger that added a crabcake on top of the burger which in itself was quite delicious.  Overall, a very good \"high-end\" burger restaurant and I would like to go back and try some of their other flavors of burgers.",

    "text": "Japanese take on Burgers.  Small industrial space in a generic strip mall next to a subway, this place has a very simple design inside.   Ox tail chili cheese fries were soo good and savory.  It was probably the best chili cheese fries I've ever had.  I do not eat beef hamburgers, so I had the fish burger, and it was pretty good. The bread was the right sweetness, and everything in the burger complemented well. Also, it was so pretty presentation wise when I got it as well. I  also love how IMPRESSIVELY thin the onion slices were-- it complected the dish perfectly and didn't overpower the burger with the big onion taste.  Great selection of microbrews, and sake.  My friend got the shogun burger (which has wagu beef and foie gras), and he said it was okay. He said the flavor overload was a bit much, and the quality of the foie gras wasn't that good. However, to each to his own. Hey, I don't even eat burgers myself.",

My first attempt to go here I was to hungry to wait- second time I called ahead (5-10 min wait) but by the time I got there it was 25 min wait... it was worth it. I had onion ring app, the shogun burger and truffle fries. The second time I ordered to go- the veggie burger and a salad... the burger had a really thick slice of eggplant that was too much for me, but great otherwise. Will return and recommend",

They have a huge variety of burgers and even some specialty items. - Kalbi burger - it was ginormous and messy (might be personal issues but whatevs). i liked the kimchi with the burger and wish there was more kimchi. the pickled cucumbers on the side was a nice touch.. too bad they don't give refills like banchan :p - truffle fries - their aoili was delish and the fries were crispy - sweet potato fries - crispy fries but i didnt like th dipping sauce too much  i'll certainly be back to try some other items on a night when i dont have to try to stuff myself into a dress.",

We chose Bachi Burger after having read many excellent reviews and magazine articles over the past year.  We were quickly seated and ready for our dining experience.  The review and articles were correct.  Bachi Burger is AWESOME!!!!!  Split  the Banh-Mi Burger and the Bachi Fish with the Mrs.   Both were GREAT!!!!!  It will be hard for us to try anything on next trip to Bachi because these sandwiches were so good.  Meat/fish were cooked to perfection and sandwiches were full of flavor.  Simply superb.  The sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had and came with a outstanding Citrus Aioli dip.  Yummy!!  Truffle Parmesan Fries also good.   The Portugese Donuts /malasadas were really good as well.  The servers and staff were very knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly.  Top of the line service in every way.  Bachi Burger is  wonderful dining experience that I would recommend to anyone with a flair for food adventure in a casual setting at a reasonable price.",

My girlfriend wanted to come here for her birthday so we came on a Saturday at about 6pm or so, we waited roughly 20min but we got seated relatively prompt seeing as we had a group of 7.   We ordered drinks and ordered food, we got the oxtail chili cheese fries first and man that was good. Really good flavor, the fries were good and the chili was extremely flavorful.   Next the burgers!   I had the Ronin Burger, the meat was cooked a perfect medium rare, caramelized onions, a Japanese slaw and an aoli.  Overall really impressed with this place and the rest of our group was as well. Very accommodating (minus the forced gratuity added) to our group.",

    "text": "Extremely good burgers, inspired sides. If you're looking for a fun and unusual gourmet burger experience, this place is it. We first ate here in 2010 and loved the experience, and had to come back - each burger or sandwich we try is even better than the last.   One thing that impresses me about the food here is the obvious care and attention placed on the ingredients and preparation. Even something as \"simple\" as the Bachi Pickle Assortment (just $3, be sure to try it) has been house made with extreme attention to detail and flavor. When you spend 15 minutes trying to puzzle out the umami of a pickle plate, you know you're in a great restaurant.  Two stand-out out burgers are the Ronin ($8) and the KiKi ($8).   The Ronin has carmelized onions, Japanese slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Kastu BBQ and Yuzy Citrus Aioli, all topped off with a fried egg.   The Kiki is dressed with a garlic chili aoli and comes topped with caramelized bacon (so amazing), sauteed shitake, enoki & eryngi mushrooms, a sweet onion marmalade and melty Gruyere cheese.   Burgers always arrive perfectly cooked, but just BE SURE to ask for medium rare or they'll cook them past medium - and these burgers SHINE at medium rare.  It's a bit of a bummer that the burgers don't come with plain fries - you have to order those on the side ($3) but the gourmet fries, such as the Truffle Parmesan ($4) are totally worth the extra cost - smothered in Parmesan Reggiano, black truffle Porcini cream, and sun dried tomato aioli, they're a must-not-miss side item.  The Pork Belly Steamed Buns & the That's Cheesy sammies are also  outstanding. You really can't go wrong with anything you'd order here.  I also appreciate their amazing drink offerings -  lovely boba drinks & shakes, incredible sodas (love the apple lychee, calamansi lime & cherry yuzu) and really great teas, such as the Mugi-Cha Barley Tea.  If you like coffee, try the Hawaiian Sea Salt Coffee, it's fantastic.  The only negative comment I have is I do have to agree with other Yelpers regarding the service; it is slow and sometimes disorganized; don't be surprised if you have to wait to be seated, then wait to have your order taken, then wait for your food .... but just order a lovely dessert special and some coffee; at least that will take your mind off the long wait for the bill.",

Unfortunately every time I come in here the service seems to get worse and worse which is why I only gave it four stars.  Last time I came in our table wasn't even set with utensils and napkins and we didn't get any when they brought our food. Water wasn't refilled entire time. Wasn't busy at all, maybe four tables. Thankfully the food has remained great.  The oxtail chili fries are always a must but make sure you have someone to share with because they're filling. As far as the burgers, the Spicy Miso Burger and Kiki's Burger are my personal favorites. I always go for the Wagyu beef on my burgers too. Really hope service improves because the food is definitely worth coming back for.",

    "text": "Maybe I ordered the wrong things? I wish I could return for a do over but as I live in another state I'll just have to lay out my experience for what it was. A-OK. When in Vegas on vacation I scoured Yelp to find a truly \"local\" eatery that we could visit for lunch with our friends. All the Vegas yelpers and some Honolulu yelpers I know were all wowed by Bachi Burger so I insisted we drive off the strip to eat there.  First off the decor is not the greatest, just a dimly lit space with tables and chairs. I don't really care what a place looks like as long as it's clean and the food is great. We were seated quickly and our waiter gave us the run down on popular dishes. I ended up ordering the kalbi burger along with sweet potato fries and a peanut butter chocolate shake. Our food took awhile to come out but as we were catching up with our friends we didn't really care.   My Kalbi burger had less flavor than I expected. I think I had it in my head that it was going to be sweeter but the size of the burger was good. With all the ingredients in and on the burger I think I expected it to be a small miracle of flavor bursting into my mouth. Talk about high expectations huh? The sweet potato fries were overcooked and too stringy so I only ate three of them and didn't finish the rest. My peanut butter chocolate shake was $4 and much too sweet. I'm a sweets fiend so if a place offers a peanut butter chocolate shake I am guaranteed going to order it. I think there was too much syrup added to my shake so there wasn't a good balance in the flavors. Sad panda.  Our waiter was a really nice guy but one thing which was very odd was that in the middle of our meal he asked us a question from behind the countertop that adjoined our table. It just felt a bit rude, almost like your neighbor listening in on a private conversation and chiming in from behind a fence. I don't think he understood why that was rude, but it's something that could be fixed for future diners. Overall very good service and smiley service.  I'm sure many will disagree with me about Bachi Burger, but I really, really wanted to like it! After reading all the stellar reviews I think that I just didn't order the right items for my particular palate. Maybe on my next trip to Vegas we will meet again Bachi Burger and we'll have a redo. I always believe in second chances. Yelpers obviously love you so there's got to be something that I missed during my visit!  Yelp 365 Challenge: #45/365 (The High Expectations)",

Pork Buns: fatty and delicious! I don't think I even need their dipping sauce. The sauce that was in the bun was perfect. The pork was juicy and savory  Miyagi-san grassfed wagyu burger: the patty itself was very succulent. The whole burger was amazeballs. Furakake is naturally salty, but it wasn't overpowering in this dish. Like I said, amazeballs.  Overall, I would come back for the burgers and pork buns. Service was good.

It was only later on that we found out this restaurant had been featured on Diners, Dives and Drive-ins.    So glad we stopped here.  It's really a unique burger experience.  If I had to describe this place, I would illustrate it as a higher end burger joint, with a Japanese hint to it.  The burgers are freakin awesome.. Wow..    We started with a couple of beers and the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries. My wife is not a chili person at all and she actually like the chili cheese fries. For her to like this dish says a whole lot about the wonderful flavor.  The dish was featured on Food Network and it lives up to the hype folks.    For entrees, my wife had the 7 oz Bachi Angus Burger.  On the reccomendation of the waitrees, I tried the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger.    Both were oh so very flavorful and had a nice aftertaste as well. You wouldn't think of a burger as having a good aftertaste...these did...  Give it a try if you are out and about in Las Vegas and have a hankering for a good burger.",

The bun is the best I have ever had  ( soft on the outside and is grilled for a nice crunch) ! We had the ox tail fries ..we had the jalapeno taken out but was told they were in the chili. I did not mind the heat  to much, was a nice balance with the sweetness from the chili. I had the boba tea with taro ..YUM!  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the mediocre  service and the higher price for the food.  All in all I would recommend Bachi Burger to anyone who wants some great food with a Asian twist!!!",

    "text": "Came to BB on a couple of friends' recommendations. Unfortunately, their burgers failed to make it in my top ten. They weren't bad... they just weren't as good as other gourmet burgers I've had.  I ordered the Miyagi-san Burger (medium-rare) w/ Parmesan Truffle Fries. My wife got the Ronin Burger (medium) with regular fries. They arrived at our table about half an hour later, and we immediately noticed her burger was bloodier than mine. This was not a good start for my wife. We would have asked to cook it more, but we were already running short on time, so we split our burgers (which we were going to do anyway) since mine was less bloody.  I thought the Miyagi-san was good... I definitely enjoyed it more than the Ronin, which wasn't as flavorful IMO. I liked the crunchy texture from the onion rings, but overall, I was a bit underwhelmed. I think there was just too much going on. The more burgers I eat, the more I appreciate the simplicities of them. And as bloody as both patties were, I found them to be a bit dry. The sauces on the burgers added the juiciness to them, not the patties.  The Ronin didn't have as much going on as the Miyagi-san, but it wasn't any better as a whole. The caramelized onions were good, but that was about it. The slaw was barely noticeable, and the sauce didn't make a big impact for me. And the buns on both burgers barely managed to hold up.  The Parmesan Truffle Fries were mediocre at best. I thought the truffle part meant they would just be fried w/ truffle oil or that the fries would be topped with truffle shavings, but they basically dumped this truffle-ish sauce over the fries that was very overwhelming. It felt like I was dipping the fries in a mushroom soup. I did not enjoy this. The only saving grace was the sun-dried tomato dipping sauce on the side.  Service was great and the restaurant was clean, but when it comes to the food, I'd say Bachi is just A-OK. I may return one more time to try the Kalbi Burger and Oxtail Fries, but if I'm not impressed with those, I'm scratching this place off my list.",

    "text": "A buddy had seen Bachi featured on some Food Network tv show. Since I'm an easy sell and pretty much a sucker for advertising, that was endorsement enough for me to search out this place.  As soon as I saw the Shogun burger on the chalkboard outside, I knew I had to be an idiot and go for it. (I'm particularly susceptible to chalkboard marketing, I should add.)  The shogun is one of their specialty wagyu beef burgers with a layer of unagi, pan-seared foie gras (this is what sold me), thin slices of asian pear and miso butter spread. On the side they throw in a yamamomo peach. Not sure why but maybe it helps theoretically justify the $25 price tag.    Before we get to the burgers, I gotta say that the milkshakes (all of them) were awesome. Creamy, thick and diabetes-inducing. I liked my strawberry-guava, but everyone else thought the peanut butter one was tops.   The much-talked-about ox-tail fries were a surprise. The ox-tail \"stew\" covering the french fries is actually a little sweet and tasted great. I thought it would just be chili-cheese fries using ox-tail but it had a different flavor than I anticipated.  We had to stop ourselves from ordering seconds so we wouldn't ruin our appetites.   Okay, main event. So I bought the biggest, baddest burger off the regular menu. Did I love it? Honestly for the price I found it okay. The beef they use for their burger tasted good, and when I bite into a burger I don't watch sauces or ketchup to take away from the lovely flavor of cow carcass. The unagi was my least favorite part because its flavor really overpowered everything else (except for sweetness of the pear) and made every bite just taste like unagi. So minus the unagi, I'm left with a good beef patty, pear and foie gras. It all tasted pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend it for $25.  I also tried the Ronin burger which has a little sweetness too from a layer of coleslaw and I really enjoyed it overall. Next time I have to try the pork steamed buns and some of the other burgers as well. Maybe the Shogun didn't live up to my expectations, but I still had a great meal and will be back next time I'm in Vegas.  Oh, and that yamamomo peach? Popped it in my mouth (it's about the size of a marble) and looked back at everyone else watching for my reaction. I shrugged, \"Tastes like candy.\"",

I'm not sure what Bahn-Mi means, but I'd assume it's a vietnamese sandwich except in burger form. I got to try the ox-tail chili fries and the parmesan truffle fries.

Again the burger was full of flavor, love Japanese  Cole slaw with the combination of carmalized onion and a fried egg, Oh Yeah!! -Really busy and I wouldn't say service was slow. There was enough time between the steamed buns and the burger to enjoy the meals in little sections. One of the owners, Aaron(spelling) made his way to each table to talk to the custumers and was very friendly. The server was also friendly and even was talking requests on any alcoholic items that we might like to see on the menu in the future....My new favorite Burger Spot!!!",

    "text": "If you like burgers, fries & Asian food, you should eat at Bachi Burger the next time you visit LV.  No, these aren't your your typical crappy patties with some kim chee slapped on. These are some seriously tasty, gourmet quality burgers prepared with an Asian twist.  Their menu is simple & highlighted by specialty Japanese, Korean & Vietnamese style burgers, as well as American style signature Kobe & Wagyu beef burgers. There are some Chinese inspired steamed bun sandwiches too.  Truffle Parmesan Fries $4 - Ohhh-MG! These fries were epic! Parmesan Cheese on hot crispy fries, drizzled with a Black Truffle Porcini Cream & served with a Sun Dried Tomato Aioli dipping sauce. The orders are enough for two, but at only $4, I suggest ordering everyone their own. We were going to try the Sweet Potato Fries, but unanimously decided on more of the same. Needless to say, we ordered more (& more).  Kiki's Burger $8.50 - Shitake, Enoki & Eryngi Mushrooms, sweet onion spread, caramelized bacon, melted Gruyere Cheese & garlic chili aioli dressing. The flavors of the bacon, onion & dressing, combine to make this a tasty & unique mushroom burger.  Kalbi Burger $8 - garlic, Ginger & chili paste, green onions, Korean seasoned mayo & house-made Kim chee on a burger of beef & pork. The kim chee on this burger gave it a major \"wow\" factor. Out of all the tasty burgers here, call me simple, but this was my favorite.  Ronin Burger $8.50 - Japanese cole slaw, caramelized onions, miso dressing, fried egg, Katsu & Yuzu citrus aioli sauce top this mega-sized & flavored, satisfying burger. A close second-favorite for me.  BBQ Bachi Burger 7 oz. Angus Beef $7 - served with lettuce, tomato & onion, but ordered plain for my 9 year old. This thing was huge! But it must've been good 'cause he ate the whole thing & some fries too!  \"Ban-Mi\" Burger $8.50 - Pork, shrimp, lemongrass, curry aioli dressing, slivers of carrot & radish, pickled veggies, Chinese parsley & Nuoc Mam sauce top this wondrously flavored, Vietnamese inspired burger. This burger, with fresh herbs & flavors of pork & shrimp, really kicks Ba-Le Sandwich's butt!  Aside from water, we ordered the Jasmine Strawberry Lemonade, after a server mentioned that they had just made a fresh batch. The strawberry & lemon tasted really fresh & so good.  The service here was good. The servers were attentive & helpful. It took a little while (maybe not-so attentive) for someone to seat us (at an empty table that we were standing next to), but that was soon forgotten, once the fries were served.   Now one of our favorite LV restaurants, we'll surely be back to try the rest of the menu (& maybe the other fries too).",

The Bahn-Mi burger was also tasty, but once again slightly sweet.  The pickled veggies really make that burger..I'd want it piled high next time.  Can't wait to try the Ronin on my next trip.

Try the muscovy duck buns instead. Totally under-rated in comparison and super delish). I've had every burger on the menu and my favorite is the kalbi burger with a slice of Swiss cheese cooked mid-rare.  The best fries in the house are the garlic salt n pepper fries with a substituion on the sauce to be the sun-dried tomato aioli. If you are able to request for a server, ask for Ana. She'll take great care of you and make sure to answer any questions you have with patience!",

    "text": "Ever since moving to Vegas around summer of last year, I've been hearing much hype about this particular joint. Does it live up to it? ehhhh kind of. My first visit there back in September of last year killed it for me. We ordered the parmensean garlic fries with tomato aeoli sauce as an app............waited over 35 mins......keep in mind this place was not busy at all...........still no fries....come on now, how long does it take to throw some fries in the fryer? Not only that but our waitress at the time didn't even issue us an apology or anything, she got me at the wrong time cause I was hellllllllla hungry after a hard session at the gym. Burgers were alright, just service couldv'e been better, minus 1 star.  Decided to give Bachi another try last night, went late night around 11pm with my gf again , WAY BETTER SERVICE!! looks like they have a new staff? Anyway, was greeted and sat down right away by our waitress Melissa, really nice gal. She catered to us right away and was prompt with our orders, I had the parmesean fries again....but got them within 10 mins! superb Melissa! Munched on those while we waited for the Duck Steam Bums....kind of like a chinese taco if you think about it....BOMB.COM!! Our burgers came right after...I got the Miyagi-San Grass fed wagyu burger....a little greasy but worth every gut busting calorie! HECK YEAH!!!! my gf had the....I forgot...it looked a little healthier than mine though lol. WHATEVER, GO BIG OR GO HOME! We were constantly checked up on by Melissa and even a fellow waiter, don't know his name but service meant everything, I know...I'm a supervisor at asian diner.   Good job on the food and service Bachi Team! the only negative I have to say about the latest trip though, the fries were a little too crunchy/well done for my liking, but whatever, burgers made up for it!  P.S   They have the Food Channel playing on their LCD Tv's :) And the music is lounge/Chill, perfect mix.",

Servers were friendly enough, but everything just took far too long. It took forever to be seated, order our food, get the check, etc. We waited over 20 minutes for them to bring out our order, which they messed up. With that said, everyone was very nice and didn't hesitate to fix their mistake.  Atmosphere is nice with simple, modern decor, but the tables are crammed way too close together. We were literally sitting 2 inches from the people behind us.  I would love to come back because the food was good, but at the same time I dread the excruciatingly long wait. Perhaps they haven't had any prior restaurant experience?  We ordered the Peking Duck Buns, Bachi Burger, Banh-Mi Burger, Kalbi Burger, Garlic Salt & Pepper Fries, and Sweet Potato Fries. Everything tasted great.  If they can only get their act together and provide more timely service, I'm sure they would get a lot more 5 stars.  ***UPDATE***   Went back a second time and the service was spot on! Food was just as good.",

By the time you get a burger +frieds ( please share the fries - it's wayyyy too much for one person) & a drink - your looking at around $20 - Completely worth it!   Please come to Los Angeles!!! We could use a place like yours here!",

All of them were tasty and went well with Asahi..garlic salt and pepper, truffle parmesan and sweet potato fries.    On a sidenote...has any restaurant truly found a good dipping sauce for sweet potato fries??  I haven't had one although I was thinking something on the sweeter side might be better.  Maybe honey and cinnamon or something.  And another thing...I just read up on truffle oil..it's all just chemicals isn't it?    I got the Kiki burger w/ egg and it was awesome.  Burgers are always better with egg..that's a fact!!  The bun had a real chinese bread...nikumanish quality to it which I loved and it just made it THAT much better.  Got to try the Ronin and the Kalbi burgers too.  The kimchi was interesting on the Kalbi burger..not the traditional tasting type but really went well with everything else that was going on in between those 2 pieces of bread.   Will definitely be back!",

I really enjoyed the way that they layered ingredients like fried tofu, and eggplant, rather than just giving you a veggie patty on a bun. Overall, the ingredients seemed to be of good quality.  Its always awesome when places offer delicious veggie options in addition to the usual carnivorous fare.",

I had been here before and had a great time, but sadly the second time around wasn't up to par.   Pretty much everything is cooked in peanut oil. So if you have any type of nut allergy, you're out of luck. You would think that an establishment like this would offer some type of substitution, or have a disclaimer on the menu, but apparently not the case. We have a friend who has a peanut allergy, so she ordered one of the steamed bun dishes, because she was told this dish did not contain peanut oil. After eating this dish, she did not feel well. Thankfully nothing bad happened to her. It may have missed it, but I don't recall seeing anyone offer an apology or anything along those lines. However, most of us with the exception of 1 or 2 people did not feel well after eating dinner here, so I'm not sure what was going on.   Probably won't go back after this episode.",

    "text": "The raw food wasn't the worst part (the \"in your face\" manager was)  There was water on our table when we were seated (a little creepy, since we couldn't see that it hadn't been previously been given to someone else.  Also, it was unfiltered and had a bad taste.)  We had heard about Bachi Burger on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and checked out the reviews before going.  The menu was very creative, and my husband and I looked forward to our Truffle Parmesan Fries (which we ordered as an appetizer), Ronin Burger and Kiki's Burger.  The fries took a while to come out, and while they weren't what we expected, they were delicious.  We were disappointed that we weren't given plates and that they all didn't have truffle flavor, but they were very good overall and the dipping sauce was great.  The burgers arrived while we were eating our appetizer.  We both ordered our burgers \"rare,\" and our burgers both came \"black and blue.\"  The toppings on the burgers were tasty (except the egg on my Ronin burger was overdone)  My husband managed to eat half of his burger but really didn't enjoy it.  Our server never once checked in on us, so my husband wasn't able to send his burger back to be cooked.  When the server finally came back and finally asked us how everything was, my husband told him that his burger was undercooked and said how disappointed he was that the server never checked in with us.  The server offered to have another burger made or to \"do something,\" but my husband didn't want anything other than the check and asked that the server just clear the table.    A few minutes later, the \"in your face\" manager came to the table, shoved the plate under my husband's nose and belligerently told him that the burger was rare.  The manager was really nasty and defensive.  We were shocked by this -- especially since we didn't ask the server to send over the manager.  The manager came out ready for a fight and refused to try to understand that all my husband wanted was recognition that the server should be trained to check in on tables shortly after food is served so that issues can be dealt with on a timely basis.  After the manager left, one of the owners overheard that something was wrong and came over to the table.  My husband asked for an apology from the manager.  The manager was brought out and continued to be snarky and defensive. (His apology to my husband was akin to that of a eighth grader whose mother makes him apologize for something that he didn't  think was wrong.)  The table of five next to us also had undercooked burgers and didn't eat most of their food either.  My husband pointed that out to both the owner and the manager while they were at our table.  As you would expect, the manager was defensive, and the owner seemed to listen.  That said, we won't be going back -- not because the burgers were undercooked but because of the shoddy service and the bad attitude of management.  As I sat there and watched this unfold, all I kept thinking is that this place is probably a few months away from being a candidate for \"Restaurant Impossible.\"  Robert Irvine would NEVER allow staff to berate a customer because the customer complained about being served raw food.  I understand that restaurants can have an off night but the manager's attitude is simply unforgivable.",

    "text": "We came here after a day exploring Red Rock Canyon in a group of 9. Trying to figure out where to eat, someone suggested trying this place after he saw it on DDD. I looked it up and remembered I already had bookmarked it after seeing so many great reviews, we had to go! Upon arriving we did run into a little snag, there seemed to be a bit of a wait and a lot of people in the group were getting grumpy.. We almost left, but my ever hungry friend really wanted to eat here, unusual for a guy who didn't want to wait to meet his idols Penn & Teller! Maybe his foodie senses were tingling. I knew mine were, the burgers coming out to people's tables looked amazing.  We stood around for a while, then we were moved to the back porch so we can sit while we waited. There were quite a few empty tables for a place that had a long wait, I can only assume they only seat people they can feed so people don't get pissed that the food is taking too long to come out. Makes sense I suppose. We finally got seated after waiting almost 45 minutes. From there things improved, food came out relatively quickly. We started with the Ox Tail Chili Fries. Impressively good, it disappeared quickly. When it came time to choose my burger I had a hard time deciding, they all looked so good! It was a tie between The KiKi and Mr Ho. A few others wanted to try Mr. Ho, so I chose the KiKi and a Mr. Ho to split with the group. As we waited we snacked on the Salt & Pepper Garlic fries, which had some fresh ginger thrown in which I wasn't expecting, a nice surprise as I love ginger. Our burgers came out fairly quickly. My KiKi was pretty good, the Shogun my ever hungry friend had was really good, but the Mr. Ho pretty much stole the show with it's combination of beef and Lup Cheong sausage on top not to mention it's purple Taro bun! It's a good example of how you don't need to spend $25 on a burger, at $10 Mr Ho is a bargain.  Certainly one of the highlight meals of my Vegas trip, my only complaint other than the initial wait, would be that we don't have Bachi Burger back home.",

Before I move on just to clarify (me and my wife are both ASIAN, the host for restaurant that night was a WHITE guy)  So 15minutes later my WHITE friend arrived and he went in asked for a table for 4 and got it immediately with out any questions or confirmation if he had the full party with him.  While me and my wife are still in the car.  I complained to the server and all she did was trying to make excuses for what happened and never said sorry in any sincere manner.  I was extremely upset and said i was going to post a yelp review and she said go ahead.  Normally I would of asked for a manager, but my friends were there and I didn't want to ruin the night for everyone since it was his first time at Bachi Burger. We already spend 20 minutes complaining to the server.  Me and my wife will never eat at this place ever again.",

The egg was cooked well though and I do love fried eggs on burgers.  The oxtail fries were okay, just chili cheese fries with oxtail as the protein.  Katsuhiro was excellent though, very refreshing with their homemade strawberry puree.    Service was good as well, will return the next time I'm in Vegas and am in the mood for an off the strip burger.",

    "text": "Soooo disappointing! I decided to order from this place after reading so many good reviews, and it was within 2 miles of my friend's house. I called last Thursday at around 6:10 pm. I placed an order with 3 custom burgers (2 wagyu, 1 angus) and a specialty wagyu burger. Three of the orders were straightforward, one had an extra patty with cheese+an egg.   I place the order, which in all takes the girl about 10 minutes to complete. She says confidently that it will be ready in 35 minutes. I arrive exactly 35 minutes after my order was placed. Granted, it is a smaller building and they were busy, but they appeared to be fully staffed. I walked up to the hostess and said I had a call-in order. She went to the kitchen to check on it and re-appeared letting me know it would be another 15 minutes. I don't have a problem waiting for quality food, but I do have a problem with not being told the appropriate wait time.   It took nearly another 15 minutes on top of the already 15 min-too-long order. And instead of the hostess directing you to the bar to retrieve your food and pay, she just stares at you expecting you to know to stand at the end of the awkwardly positioned counter to flag down someone else to help me. To top it all off, the order was wrong in multiple ways and the burgers were cold. I paid over $80 for this disaster meal.    I ate at Holsteins in the Cosmo the next day and was reminded of what a delicious burger is supposed to taste like.",

The burgers here all are so amazing with diverse flavors yet still maintain the classic burger necessities of a quality tasting patty sandwiched between a great bun. I am in love with the buns here thats for sure. They are fluffy, moist, crispy, and buttery heaven. I think part of the reason why i really love this place is because I love Korean food and all that it offers with spicy and diversity in the food. And I love burgers so its the best of both worlds.   I think my favorite burger on the menu has to be the Miyagi Son. It provides a really simple flavor that really packs a punch! The Ronin is a classic as well. They also let you mix it up and customize your burgers so if you're feeling like kimchi on your burger, go for it.   The oxtail chili cheese fries are a must in my opinion. Obviously, anything with a fried egg and garlic aioli on it is going to be delicious but really the flavors on these fries are unreal! They also have a great selection of boba teas if you feel like getting your boba on!",

    "text": "Bachi Burger is really burgerlicious! Be warned the amount of MSG is so freaking high it made me dizzy. well at least i assumed it was MSG.. not sure... I guess if your sensitive to MSG like myself you might end up on the floor.lol. But the two times ive been there i would feel it.  My recent visit to bachi burger was during the busy dinner hours.. The waiters were all busy and it took forever to get just a drink order , and the waitress took forever to take our orders, but it's okay just make sure you are aware during the busy dinner hours you will have slow service.. This was fine with me because I was conducting a business transaction dinner..  For drinks I ordered the green tea, it was really a drink that quenched your thirst.  Add a pack of sweet n low for those of you who love your teas sweet..  For starters I ordered the Oxtail chili cheese fries. I highly suggest you trying this.. One of my favorite starters here..  For our burgers we ordered;  The famous Miyagi burger medium on the meat. - This burger is topped with a sweet bun in the inside it came with friend breaded onions, egg, the burger sprinkled with furikake mix. SUPER BOMB!!!!  I also had the the privileged to taste half of my associates burger he ordered the Kalbi burger which if i remembered consisted of lettuce and kimchi and kalbi burger. Really good as well but i still prefer the Miyagi over the kalbi burger.  For french fries we ordered a side of truffled parmigian fries, which came with a special sauce. i highly recommend this as well.  Even thou service was slow during dinner time i still give this place a 5 star, during lunch service is better. I'm not sure if it was my waitress at the time , that made the service slow.. but hey im not complaining, i still love this place! going again once a friend of mine arrives from hawaii! :)",

    "text": "Holy crap, there went my diet.  Came here pretty late on a Saturday and my friends and I destroyed three burgers, oxtail chili chese fries, and a normal fries with pineapple ketchup.  I'd say the Miyagi-san was among the top three burgers I've ever had (I've had a LOT) - the bun, the meat, the toppings, they all worked really well together and dripped of both quality and creativity (and meat juices). I was only going to eat half, but couldn't resist finishing it because it was just that good.  My friends had the blue and green burger and a custom one with avocado, cheddar, and bacon, both of which were reportedly very good as well.  The oxtail chili cheese fries were also very good, though I have to admit I'm not as big a fan of chili on fries, but the garlic aioli really complimented it all very well. One thing that was quite surprising was the pineapple ketchup and how strong the pineapple flavor was and how well it went with the ketchup itself.  Our service was spot on with everything explained very well and our orders completed quickly and accurately. I couldn't ask for much more.  Prices seem quite fair to me for burgers of this quality, though I would not categorize it as an outstanding deal.  Afterwards, I decided to further my tailspin into diet-failing by having the almond boba milk tea. It was actually really good, though certainly pricey in comparison to the typical boba price.  I can tell I'm going to frequent this place more in the future. I'm not sure how I've managed to live here for almost a year and never really heard about this place!",

So we waited....and waited...and waited...It wasn't busy and there were several avail tables.  After about 20 mins, we were finally seated. Annoyed and hungry, we had already reviewed the menu and knew what we wanted to order.  -Sapporo ($5) -Short Rib Steamed Bun ($13.50): OK, but a bit of the dry side.  -Kikis Burger ($8.50): I had this protein style, which was perfect. The mushrooms added great flavor to the patty. -Banh Mi Burger ($8.50): It was good! Although I liked the Kiki burger better.  -Truffle Parm Fries ($4): Not bad, although I would prefer it without the brown sauce they smothered the fries with.   Total was about $43.  We didn't get our beer, so had to ask for beers and waters (and subsequent refills). I noticed that other tables-who were seated after us-began getting their orders before ours and I had to ask the status of our order. The server was apologetic, and relayed that they didn't expect the place to get busy since they just recently opened for business. I found this bothersome and disappointing. Perhaps they need a better strategy to improve their business operations ???  After an hour and a half at a burger joint, I was over it. Sorry, but we didn't leave a tip. I didn't feel it was deserved with the wait time experienced, total duration in the restaurant and not be adequately serviced.   The one star given is for the appreciation of the Asian inspired burgers and other offerings and creations. This place has potential and it looks as though it will have a strong following given prior reviews.   Perhaps, it was an \"off\" night; however, there could still be awesome customer service but they failed to deliver even that.",

The pork belly was crispy and the buns was nice and soft, love the juxtaposition of the textures. The drink was not bad, it should have gone with something else. I wanted to try the oxtail fries she.

    "text": "First off, I typically like my dishes \"traditional\". For example, if I'm going out for a burger and fries, I want a wholesome American burger and fries, authentic Chinese food, etc. With that said, I'm not usually a fan of fusion restaurants, but this place combines flavors so well - I can't deny the great taste of their burgers!  My favorite from here is the Miyagi-sun burger. It has a great mix of delicious fillings, with the crispy onion rings, caramelized bacon, fried egg and the furikake seasoning. The patty is thick and tastes of high-quality meat. There seems to be some like BBQ sauce (or maybe it's just the caramelized bacon) that makes the burger a little sweet. The onion rings cause the burger to be stacked pretty high but don't be afraid to squish everything together and get your hands a little dirty :P The burger tastes amazing with the combination of the different textures of the fillings and it's awesome to get a little bit of everything in each bite! The buns are nice and soft too (that's what he said? Haha). My bf and I also shared an order of the salt, pepper and garlic fries.. The metal cone they are served in is deceiving as it is not entirely filled with fries (stops about halfway through). Nonetheless one order of fries was perfect to be shared between the two of us. The garlic chili aioli it came with was also good, not spicy at all.   The wait was a little longer than I would have expected for our dishes, especially since it didn't seem particularly busy when we came by. We dropped in around 3pm on a Friday and there was no wait to be seated. I've also come with a bigger group and they do seem to seat parties pretty quickly. Parking is decent since it shares a bigger lot with the rest of the stores in the plaza. Service was nice and polite.   Definitely worth stopping by for a delicious and unique burger if you're in Vegas.",

    "text": "[No Bachi for coming here]  T-Shirt wearing tenders are all you need to understand what the scene is in here. It's burgers - and no need to explain the \"Bachi\" part - only that my thought is its in mixing the 2 cultures ingredients that someone may receive negative results - well by the attendance, and the amount of conversation in the air, it seems like its the reverse psychological side.  As a burger lover, you wont find cheddar, definitely not American, and hardley a sign there is a simple beef and cheese combo to be had (although you have the option of constructing your own), but you didnt come here for that anyway. I ordered the Black and Green - this is about the closest youll find to anything not too fusion-i. Their take on Wagyu Kobe Beef, naturally grass fed - open range assumed, but not Wagyu American or Japanese as stated on the front, grilled to your temp, Blue cheese crumbles, spinach, and bacon. There were some other things in there but it wasnt noticeable to note.  Burger is substantial, and to remind you this is Vegas casual, but still upscale, they give you a knife that will not only split your burger, but would probably cut through that ceramic dish they serve it on. I opted for the hands on approach, as I do. Burger is very well done (not the cooking temp, by the way of the flag atop my bun) smooth meat to cut, the quarter pound of weight measure, and was preformed, likely in a cylindrical press as I felt the tight packing, but the slightly flakey outter edge - not to be confused with a frozen pre form that is like eating a freshly sliced sausage.  All the other ingredients really melted into the background. What you actually find is that you can smell this beef, an aromatic experience I've found is reserved for the CAB versions - this is probably a hint you maybe in Kansas of experiences, where the beef is free, and the taste is pretty awesome.",

The sauce is Soooooo good with the sweet bread. Also love their peach soda. I also had the mango, kilo, miyagi and ronin burgers., loved them all. Truffle fries and salt & pepper fries are good too. Haven't ordered anything that disappointed me. Oh also, I also liked the pork belly steamed bun. Seriously, what r u waiting for, go to bachi now.  Tip: avoid going on a weekend, the wait is usually an hour",

    "text": "Overall, the food had been good here. I don't eat beef, but have enjoyed the veggie burger and the crab cake burger. I've been here with my friends and my family. Generally, they also liked the food, but the portions for children are too much, and there are not many options. Not the best for young children, but older ones should be fine.  Service is still hit or miss and its biggest liability. The staff seem disorganized at times and I've had my food messed up more than once (I've been here more than I've checked in) lately. Sometimes, it seems like some of the servers have never worked in a restaurant before. Other times, the servers have seemed to over compensate becoming intrusive.   I also got the Yelp check in special of a free beer/beverage, but it had the \"after 11pm\" stipulation and the manager was not as nice to me in terms of getting me the free beverage. (I suggest that they either do away with that \"special\" or offer it at a time that people would actually use it...)  My first impression was awesome. My following experiences have since been not as positive, and some unpleasant almost to the point of not wanting to come back. So, just be aware that service is inconsistent and tends to be slow. Or, they \"disappear\" for a while after you've placed and received your order. Food is good; service needs to improve.",

All the burger combos on the menu sounded great and we ended up ordering the veggie and Kiki's burger to spit and try something new. The veggie burger was really yummy but super crumbly and coulda used more sauce as the patty was a bit dry. Kiki's burger was excellent and it arrived and pre-smoosh was about 8 inches tall. With a side of the garlic fries, it was heaven. With a beer and garlic fries, it was nirvana. The service was also excellent and everyone was insanely nice. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "I would give this place 10 stars if I could. Come hungry because you will want to order everything..... and you should. Well you should definitely order an appetizer like their steamed buns or french fries. I really admire their sweet potato fries for some reason. Maybe because they come out hot with their own dipping sauce. Actually all of their fries are paired with their own dipping sauce. I've been here twice and I can't help myself from continuing to order the Kalbi burger. I love Korean food and this burger is the perfect combination a Korean themed burger needs. The Kalbi is also served with a small side of pickled cucumbers. MMMMMMMMMM. Watch out because this patty is juicy and it drips all over the place but it will not stop you from enjoying your meal and experience at Bachi. The bun does it's job by holding everything intact. Amazing burger.  They play some pretty banging music too, just wish they had a speaker in the bathroom.  Definitely a must stop if you are in Las Vegas. Hell, Bachi was a huge reason I decided to go back to Vegas last month.",

    "text": "My friend had been raving about this place and how we just had to try it. It's way off the strip, about 5 miles so make sure you're willing to drive or take a cab. I heard it was also on one of those food network shows so it's getting more popular by the minute. When we got there around 1pm on a Saturday afternoon, there were groups of people chilling in the parking lot. I was prepared to wait a little bit but it was kinda insane, since we ended waiting probably about an hour and a half. We had a larger party of 6. So maybe that's the reason. But this place is not very big. They also advertised another location but not sure where that one is located. I def recommend smaller groups visiting or coming right when it opens to avoid the tortuous wait. Anyways finally was seated and got to order. Food takes about 15-20 minutes to come out so I recommend getting fries to tide you over. Unfortunately I didn't get a say and someone said yeah, bring everything at one time (instead of staggered or when ready). So I continued to starve a little longer (given it was almost like 3pm now and I had not eaten since dinner/5pm the previous day). This was a bad idea as I proceeded to scarf down my food super fast when it came to the table and my stomach was not feeling all that great about halfway through my burger. At least that's what I choose to believe over something was wrong with the food (ie contaminated or worse). I tried the Kiki's burger with mushrooms, onions, bacon and cheese. It was pretty darn good. And this is really an eat your burger with a fork and knife kind of place. Yeah the burgers are huge. Not sure how I could fit that thing into my mouth. As for the sides, for our big group we tried the oxtail chili cheese fries and the truffle fries. I love oxtail but was a little disappointed with these fries because I couldn't really taste the oxtail in it. It really just tasted like regular chili cheese fries to me but with an egg on top that made it slightly better. Since it was split up between a bunch of it, I only got to have a little bit so I may have to give it another try next time I'm in town. The truffle fries were really good though and I liked the truffle sauce they have on top. Didn't care too much for the sauce on the side - it's not totally needed IMO. Overall a pretty pricey meal. Burgers start at $10 and go up including the $26 fois gras burger. And the chilli cheese fries were like $11 with the truffle fries at about $4. My share with the gratuity charge they tack on with large groups was $20. Good thing I can only come every once in a while when I'm in Vegas. So many good burger combinations to try.",

Well, it was all over my social network since I saw at least a dozen pictures of the Shogun burger with my name tagged on it.  What is the Shogun burger?  Well, it's the biggest, baddest Japanese style burger you ever feasted your eyes upon.  Imagine a huge kobe beef patty with fois gras (duck) and unagi (eel) topped with some of that secret special sauce.  Let's say that's one of the most unique tasting burger I had in my life.  I never imagined unagi tastes so good next to beef.  Fois gras is default good for those sophisticated eaters.  You're probably wondering what else is on the menu.  Well, they had more earthly hamburgers compared to the heavenly Shogun burger, fries, duck entree, etc.  Just look at the website and you will know but I'll end the review that Shogun burger is the best!  Side note: A shogun is a military ruler (think dictator or general) of medieval Japan.  Essentially they had all the power over their territory.",

Since the waiting room is full, we asked him to give us a call instead.  He obliged and promised that he will.  We will just wait  inside our car.   Forty five minutes has passed there was no call and when we checked our status, we learned that he skipped us twice.  Its was not a matter of how many people will fit in available table. That was not the case as it was not his reason when I confronted him.  He even told us to wait for another 10 minutes.  The nerve.  Luckily, John the other server pacified us and gave us another table. And his service and attitude is commendable.   Alex or Aries or should I call him Brutus ( Popeye's enemy) came and apologized but I felt no sincerity in his action.   I bet he is used to saying and promising things he can not deliver.  He is so inconsiderate and dishonest.  He knows that people go there very hungry,  want to eat, be served right away and leave.

    "text": "We went to Bachi Burger before a show at UNLV, and were blown away by the incredible burger and fries selection.  Let's start with the basics.  Bachi is the brainchild of Lori Watada, formerly Roy Yamaguchi's sous chef.  Imagine the best burgers in the world, done in a variety of asianesque styles, with a full compliment of appetizers, Japanese style pickles, entrees for those who don't like beef, and amazing fries...  I got the Shogun, their most expensive burger, a rare and heodistic tribute to all that is fat and good in a burger of wagyu beef, plus pan seared fois gras, unagi (broiled eel for those of you who don't know, a stunningly delicious Japanese staple), poached pear and secret sauce.  The burger was cooked perfectly (medium rare equals rare, but that is how you want American wagyu), and eating it was a nearly religious experience.  My wife got the Keki, smothered in premium mushrooms and a delicious sauce.  The parmesan truffle oil fries were good....but not great, and the sweet potato fries were perfect.  I am going to have to go back and eat my way through the rest of the menu..... Our service was good, especially given how busy it was, and we noticed that they were turning people away 20 minutes after we got there at 6pm becasue the place was full and there was a waiting list.  They serve a limited array of wine, beers sake and drinks....in a casual setting that is just crowded enough to feel like you are part of something.  I have decided that in all Las Vegas this is my new go to burger spot.... The burgers cost $9 to $25 (the Shogun), and I cannot wait to go back!   They are opening a fine dining spot next door....that will be on my list too....",

I see some people complaining about the customer services, but I thought they were pretty pleasant. It did take quite some times before our food arrived, but they say good things happen to those who wait.   I ordered short rib seamed bun, and my bf ordered spicy miso. We were both happy with the food we've got; just, I thought my steamed bun tasted much better with miso sauce instead of yuzu horse radish aioli. We also ordered Truffle Parmesan Fries which was interesting and creative. It was our first time, and this place has a big menu, so I'm definitely coming back.",

    "text": "So one of my friends invites a bunch of us to this new burger place that he discovered recently.  Says he and his girlfriend love the food here, and would love to go here as a group.  The burger place in question is none other than Bachi Burger, which appeared to take quite the beating when it came to service.  It had been a while since the place opened, so I figured any kinks in service would be ironed out by now.  Stopped by here tonight and I can safely say that there were no issues with the service.  Drinks were kept full, we were checked on regularly, servers brought extra silverware in case we all wanted to share a dessert etc.  No complaints there.    The reason this place is getting three stars from me is that they seem to pile toppings onto burgers without know when to quit!  I got myself a Ronin burger, and it seemed that the Japanese cole slaw and katsu sauce were both fighting over who gets to my tastebuds first.  Yes, there were carmelized onions, miso dressing, and an egg on the burger, yet all these flavors were overpowered by the cole slaw and katsu.  Even the beef was overpowered by them; they also didn't ask how I wanted my beef cooked.  It was done medium well, while I prefer medium to keep some pink and juicyness in the middle of the patty.  I also ordered a Vietnamese coffee; it wasn't as good as I've had at other restaurants.  The coffee is served and is still being strained when it is brought to your table.  It came out dark and had a strong aroma, which set my expectations high.  Sadly, the coffee wasn't that strong and ended up being overpowered by the milk.  All in all Bachi Burger is alright, and I'd probably stop by every once in a while if I lived nearby.  As is, with me living in the southwest, I doubt I'll be returning any time soon.",

I had never had a burger w/ fried egg and I'm glad Bachi Burger was the first place i tried it, because they didn't do me wrong. It was a bit messy but not where the patty is sliding out of the bun kinda messy, which I hate.   Second time, got the Kabli burger (no bacon) and OMG..best burger ever! It was cooked perfectly, the bun was amazing, the cheese, everything was perfect. BOTH times have gotten the Parmesan truffle fries. Seriously people, do not pass these fries up. They are the best. I love that everything comes with a dipping sauce. I'm a huge fan of dipping!  The wait staff is awesome and very informative..this place is definitely a hit, I hope it sticks around for a long time!",

    "text": "I dined at Bachi Burger earlier today for lunch. This was my first time eating here, my friend said we should  try this place out.   The restaurant itself is very contemporary, not your typical burger joint with stools near the kitchen or anything like that. It's Asian inspired with artwork, wooden floors and a clean yet simple set up.   I ordered the Bachi Caeser and BBQ Bachi Burger. They have a menu with American-Asian fused cuisine. Very Hip and Different!  Customer Service was okay. When we walked in there were several people who said Hi and right away set us up a table. Later on , there was only one waitress for the entire floor. I'm guessing everybody else went on break? It took a minute to get a refill or ask for the check.  My only concern was the Salt and Pepper French Fries. My friend ordered them and as we were eating them, we noticed a WORM slithering about the fries! To our disgust, we politely asked the waitress to look at it to prove we weren't insane. She took the fries away and sent the General Manager our way. He was very polite, apologized and offered us dessert. I think that was the best way to handle a situation like that.   Overall, my first experience there was okay. I'll definitely come back another day... but I'll make sure to check the fries for any visitors ;)",

Waited a little while before it came to us, which was fine. Ordered salt and pepper garlic fries, the miyagi San burger, and some ramen. Burger came cooked to perfection. Absolutely delicious. Ramen came a little while after, perfect as well. We had to flag down our server because we were waiting for the fries and we needed a refill on our water. He forgot to put it in. So he got it in and waited about 15 mins for it. It was really bad. We usually order it and haven't had issues before but there was just so much ginger in it.  We tried to get at least halfway through but the ginger was so overpowering that we couldn't even get halfway!! So we get the bill and I wasn't charged the happy hour price for my drink. To our waiter's defense, he tried to fix it after I already paid, but I was so ready to leave. We usually have nothing but good things to say about this place and always refer friends and family here as a must have before they leave Vegas. Hopefully this is just an isolated incident because this is the first time we left disappointed.",

The rest are just lasting around and also arguing with, fighting and bitching this blonde chef. She seems to be the only person filling the orders. They have about 5 other people in the kitchen with her that ain't doing jack shit, moving slow, just bitching and plain old lazy.  I've been here about 30 minutes and still waiting to be seated at an empty restaurant. They purposely are not seating us because the chef is overworked right now and can't handle the existing orders from people already seated. This place is a serious unorganized shithole and the only person working looks as if she is ready to quit.  The servers are running around like chickens with the head cut off.... in an empty restaurant. I've never seen anything like it. No leadership, no moral, no team work. Just terrible.   There is no quality of food that will bring them back from the one star that I will be leaving them.",

    "text": "After seeing this place featured in Food Network's Triple D, it's been something I've always wanted to try in Vegas. There's never enough time when visiting Sin City but we made sure this time Bachi Burger was on our itinerary. Hopping on over here after a show off the strip, their closing time at 1am was perfectly convenient.   OXTAIL CHILI FRIES ($11.50) is a must-order. Most poutine fries I've had other than in Montreal tend to get soggy from all the gravy, but not here. I also love that it's not thick-cut resulting to a most-welcomed crunch on each bite. With beans and shreds of oxtail meat in the chili sauce, topped with garlic aioli, plus cheese and jalapenos, each component delivered its purpose. Let's not forget the cilantro which is my favorite part as it added a clean and distinct finish to the flavor profile. This was the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>!    RONIN WAGYU BURGER ($16) normally comes with Angus beef patty but you can request for Wagyu meat for extra $$. I suggest you go this route because I tell you, it makes a huuuuuge difference. One bite and the unmistakable taste I got instantly was from the high grade beef. It had a nice smoky char-grilled flavor that was oozing with all its juicy splendor! WOW! The caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, and katsu bbq all fused well together into this phenomenal finished product. I really love everything about this burger including the bun! Not sure if you need the yuzu citrus aioli on the side because it's already flavorful as it is.   KIKIS BURGER ($12) is Angus beef patty with sauteed Japanese mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli. After having the wagyu beef patty with my Ronin burger, it was hard not to spot the difference between the two. The former was definitely more delicious however, let's not forget this burger had bacon and everyone knows anything with bacon is good. When in doubt, stick with the Ronin.   CHILI FRIED CHICKEN ($7) was good but just not the flavor I was looking for. I was hoping it was more like a Korean chili chicken with a sweet glaze, instead, this was more tangy and on the citrusy side. Packed most of it home and ate it the next day. Surprisingly, it tasted better.  Our server was on top of things and was very knowledgeable about the menu. I mean who doesn't like talking to people who knows what they're talking about? The rest of the staff was friendly and in a genuine way. Can't complain!   So happy Bachi Burger has now opened its doors in LA. Soon OC, I hope!",

When our server came by to ask us what we wanted to drink, we gave him our request.  Right before he left to get the drinks, I said, \"We're ready to order.\"    I guess I may have sounded a bit harsh but only because I was starving.  My sister gave me that look after he left and said, \"Sheesh!  Don't be so hANGRY.\"  Lol  Nevertheless, our server was a sweetheart.  We ended up ordering:  Tonkotso shio ramen: $10 Pork belly buns: $11 Kiki's burger: $12 Oxtail fries: ?  Pork belly buns and the oxtail fries came out first.  Pork belly buns were good but not great.  It could have used a tad bit more pork belly.  I felt the ratio to the pork and bun were a bit off.  The taste was great though.   Oxtail fries were awesome.  They lived up to the hype.  We had big chunks of oxtail and it was very tasty.  Fries were cooked to perfection.    Kiki's burger was delicious and very hearty.  We ordered medium rare and it came out perfect.  It paired well with the oxtail fries.  I would definitely order this again.  Only item I didn't care for was the ramen.  Perhaps I'm biased because I had just dined in at Ippudo in NYC a few weeks prior to my Vegas trip.  The ramen tasted a bit fishy.   All in all, my experience was great and I will be visiting very soon.",

Service was good too.  Understandably there was a lunch rush so we weren't checked on regularly, but our server was very nice!",

    "text": "What do I do when I first land in Vegas? I start looking at my Yelp bookmarks!  My cousin and I wanted to start things off with a great meal. To the days leading to our Vegas trip, he kept talking about Bachi Burger until my ears had a constant ringing! I finally gave into his pleas and agreed to go. After picking up our rental car we headed to Bachi Burger.  When we arrived, around lunch time, it was semi-busy. The hostess quoted us a seating time of ten minutes. It seemed the wait was shorter than that. We ended up getting a table within five minutes. Once we were seat, our menus were handed to us and was told our server will be right with us. Our waitress came to us within a couple minutes and took our drink orders. After being dry from the airport, I decided to get an alcoholic beverage. I went for the Sake Sanga-Ria.  The Sake Sanga-Ria was a light and refreshing drink. The combination of sake and sangria had an inviting taste, but then knocks you with a light buzz. Who am I to complain about that! The bits of apple in the drink were also laced with the concoction of alcoholic goodness.  For our appetizers we ordered the following, which include these ingredients:    - Pork Belly Steamed Buns: Duroc Pork Belly, Cilantro, Scallions, Radish, Boiled Egg, Chinese Black, Vinaigrette,  Hoisin, BBQ Sauce  - Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries With Garlic Aioli and Fried Egg  The pork belly was melt in your mouth good. The steamed bun was soft to bite. The veggies, boiled egg, and sauces made the steamed bun very enjoyable. Next, the oxtail chili cheese fries. I have never tasted anything like this! I'm only fond of the chili and cheese on fries, but the oxtail takes this appetizer to another level! The oxtail was tender, fries crispy, and the chili thick. Adding the fried egg on top of this dish my sound weird, but it just made it much better.  For my main course, I ordered the Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger. This burger was composed of chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings. When I received my burger, it was piled high with the listed ingredients. I had to split the burger in two to handle this burger. Biting into the burger brought memories of another favorite burger spot of mine in San Jose, CA. Konjoe Burger. The summation of this burger was juicy, tender, and crispy.  The nagging of my cousin about this place was well worth it! This was just our first stop, but I felt like we overdid ourselves. Oh boy!",

The porkbelly could be a cooked a little more, but the spicy miso ramen was great.  The shogun burger was also really good.  I left my seared pears on the side and nixed the unagi, and the burger was still rich and juicy.  I loved the foie gras and the oils from it enhanced the burger patty that much more.  The oxtail chili cheese fries were also a win.  I would like mine with a little more cheese to balance the sweetness of the chili, but overall, it was a great big dish of yum.  The boba pearls were a little on the chewy side for me, but the black milk boba was refreshing and didn't fill me up.  We showed up for lunch on a Monday and the place is packed.  A table for two would have only taken about 20 minutes, but we opted to sit at the bar.  Service wasn't super prompt, but we were never forgotten.  We wanted to try their fried chicken, but they had already sold out.  Next time Bachi Burger, next time.",

We called in to get a to go order for pick up. The person who answered the call transfered us to a server. When the server answered I was just making sure that the food would be ready by the quoted time, the server's response was \"we can give you a quoted time but if it goes over that time, it's not our fault. So you can either come in and put it an order or take the chances by calling\". (In such a rude tone) HORRIBLE. As good of a food you have, this location has bad service !   I'd rather get my food somewhere else or drive all the way to the one on Sahara and fort apache. I hope they make another location so I won't be stuck not getting a bachi burger since this is the one nearby my house.

I got the Kiki's burger which I highly recommend (it was that good). My boyfriend got the Banh Mi burger that is full of flavor! To top it off I forgot to mention that as an appetizer we got the oxtail fries. The fries were gone within 5 seconds!! Highly recommend this place to anyone who come to Las Vegas!",

Shogun Burger- most expensive burger I'll probably ever have, $26.  It was worth it!  I got my burger medium and it was cooked perfectly.  I couldn't really tell the difference between the wagyu beef pattie vs. a regular pattie.  I love unagi and it was a good compliment to everything else in the burger!  The poached pear added a slight sweetness to all the savory flavors going on.  And foie gras... who doesn't love it?!   Spicy Miso Burger- I had this on my first visit and it's still my favorite.

I place a takeout order the next night but am told that Dylan isn't in. A lady named Savannah tells me that there's no memo and that Dylan needs to be there to confirm what happened just last night.

The food was pretty good...burger was cooked just the way I like it, medium. 3 of the girls ordered the Ronnin Burger and 2 of the girls ordered the Kiki burger. So as you can tell, those two were probably the more popular ones. I had ordered the Ronnin burger as well, and it was really good. The burger had a fried egg in it...but what made it even better was the citrus aioli. They give that to you on the side, but seriously, that was one of the reasons why I liked this burger. The kiki burger had mushrooms in it and that was great too. But if I had to choose, I like the Ronnin burger more.   They have Strawberry Guava Shake, but I wasn't brave enough to order that...too heavy for me I suppose. I still had to drive 4 hours home. However, I was able to order the Momo..peach and strawberry soda! that was so refreshing and yummy. Too bad it wasn't free refills, otherwise they would have heard from me for more. The fries were okay. We had the parmesan cheese one and the salt and pepper one. Everyone liked the salt and pepper one more. There was this gravy looking sauce on the parmesan fries...not so good. The sauces that came with it were not memorable, I didn't even dip them. The salt 'n' pepper fries reminded me of the asian dish salt 'n' pepper shrimp. No shrimp flavor but that salt 'n' pepper is definitely there!    I wanted to try the spicy miso burger because I heard it was only there seasonal. But maybe next time. I will get that milkshake next time!",

Service was horrible, but the people working there were friendly.  However, I never received an apology of why their patty was completely burnt, not cooked \"medium\", and tasted like kalbi when I didn't order a kalbi burger.  For two burgers, oxtail fries, a flat soda, and a bottle of beer, we paid over $50.  Definitely not worth your trip out.

I already knew what to order coming to this restaurant after seeing their episode on the Food Network, but our waiter told us his recommendations. Ordered the bahn mi burger, truffle fries, and red velvet milkshake.   It didn't take that long for the food to come out and once it did everything looked absolutely delicious. The presentation of each dish was on point and very creative. The burger was super good! It had the whole bahn mi aspect to it with the flavors/ingredients and the burger was really juicy.  The truffle fries were piping hot, crispy, and the truffle sauce took the fries to another level. Lastly, the red velvet milkshake was the BOMB and it was literally a red velvet cake in a milkshake form.  I highly recommend this place whenever you're in Vegas and a heads up, they have two locations out there. They're opening one in the West Los Angeles area and I certainly can't wait for that!",

We purposely went in the late afternoon on Thursday knowing how busy it can get and there were three parties ahead of us waiting.  Luckily there were spaces available at the bar so we chose to eat at the bar vs waiting for a table.  My husband and I shared the oxtail chili cheese fries, green and black burger and the pork belly bao.  Everything cooked to perfection and so delish...will definitely be coming back each time when we're in town.",

We saw a line out the door when we were looking for a parking, so we had our doubts that we might have to eat somewhere else.  Upon checking in to be seated, we got a \"not\" so warm & friendly greeting from the hostess. I would describe her as one of those people who are not happy with their job...quick tip Erika, look for another profession, or at least force yourself to smile! All the other staff was smiling and just gave a great vibe, most especially Dan!..the guy behind the bar, thanks again for giving us super awesome service! While I ate, I just saw how nice of a person he is to the other customers! As for the food, it was really good! Juicy burgers and my husband just killed the plate of oxtail chili fries! The reviews from our friends were definitely spot on!",

    "text": "Based on several recommendations by my friends in the local area, I had to try Bachi Burger. It appears they have two locations around the Las Vegas area although they are opening one up in West LA in 2013 which is good for me. This burger joint is somewhat distant from the strip, however, well worth the stop. I'd recommend coming during off peak hours. When we were leaving, there was a big line for dinner to this place, a indicator that there is good food inside. The service was really good. The waiters were trained to introduce themselves and to answer any questions that we had about the menu.  As an appetizer, I had a piece of my friend's Pork Belly Steamed Buns It contained Duroc Pork Belly, cilantro, scallions, radish, boiled egg, Chinese black vinaigrette, and hoisin sauce. I typically don't like eating steamed buns, but when I took a bite into this, it was SO GOOD! It made me rethink my stance on steamed buns.  Also, I requested the fries to come as an appetizer. I ordered their truffle parmesan fries which contains parmesan reggiano, black truffle shavings, chives, and comes with a side of sun dried tomato aioli dipping sauce. I was disappointed at their truffle fries. I was hoping that they would have utilized truffle oil to cook the fries. Instead, it tasted your typical french fry you would have at any fast food place. If I had to do it over again, I would skip the fries as their selection of burgers and appetizers are so much more appealing.  Finally, for the main course, I had the Spicy Miso Burger which contains a massive patty of Angus beef, onions, shishito peppers, mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, fried egg, and apple vinaigrette sauce. When a took a bite out of this sandwich, I was wondering what happened to the shishito peppers? I didn't really taste the peppers at all. I was completely overwhelmed by the apple vinaigrette sauce. The sandwich was decent, but the combination of ingredients is suspect. Perhaps there is too much going on in the sandwich where it loses its identity as a spicy miso burger.   If I am ever around this part of Las Vegas again, I would definitely stop by to try some of their other burgers such as their Kalbi burger.",

    "text": "I guess since I'm the Duke of Bachi Burger (as of 9/11/2014) I should relinquish my duties as Duke, whatever those might be, to finally write a review of this place.   It took 60+ visits for me to come on here and officially proclaim: Bachi Burger is the best burger joint in town.  I read all of the 3 star and below reviews and I feel sad for those reviewers.  Not because they don't have good taste, but because they clearly haven't experienced the Bachi that I've come to know and love over the years since it opened.  I will say that even though I am blessing it with 5 stars, I've definitely had moments where I questioned that rating, be it from visits where I experienced awful service, undercooked burgers, or the terrible, terrible practice of their writing down my credit card info every time I make a take-out order.  All of those are forgiven though for me due to the 85% of the time when everything is flawless.  I've had almost everything on the menu.  My absolute favorite order is the Black and Green burger.  When they nail it, they absolutely nail it.   The Wagyu beef, bacon, blue cheese, spinach and mushrooms all form together like Voltron to make one of the best burgers I've ever had.  But there are 70 other reviews where you can read about that.   I also really like the Lonely Bird when I'm not feeling like red meat, which isn't too often.   Miyagi San, Banh-Mi, Ronin, all solid as well and belong in my rotation.     One thing I rarely see mentioned or see people take advantage of is the build your own burger feature.  I've actually had several times just a straight up Bachi Burger with a Wagyu patty which comes standard with Lettuce, Tomato and Onion and anything else you want, but it doesn't even need anything else.  It's nice to know that they're not just putting lipstick on a pig, or in this case, a cow, and that the meat can stand on its own.    I hinted earlier at undercooked burgers and I will say that in my experience Bachi tends to cook on the lower end of the spectrum.   Medium-Rare which is how I would normally like it has come out too rare for me and Medium often comes out the way I'd normally expect Medium-Rare.   So I stick with medium for the most part.   For fries they do a decent sweet potato fry, and oddly enough I just don't get the hype over the oxtail chili cheese fries even though I've had them 5-6 times, once done over sweet potato fries which I think is a special order type thing.   Fries, oxtail meat, and egg sounds like my death row last meal, but each time I found them underwhelming and prefer to just go the Salt and Pepper Garlic french fry route.   The fries aren't at all what keeps me coming back here and I'd like to see them experiment more with different varieties, but it seems to be the same ones from the first day I went there and I'm guessing that won't change anytime soon.  Drink-wise they do a mean sake sangria which I find irresistible, although pricey and they have Rogue Hazelnut ale, so I'm normally happy either way.     Service can be inconsistent, usually due to how it's ALWAYS BUSY, but there are several very solid individuals who work there at the moment and they treat the Duke with respect, as they should.",

    "text": "For some reason, I bookmarked this place without actually reading about it.  I actually thought it was a fast food-ish restaurant.  HAH.  Wrong.  It's a pretty nice sit down restaurant!  Ordered:  Husband tried the Miyagi-sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger with Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings.  The $13 is quite attractive and definitely the way to go if you want the wagyu beef.  A regular wagyu burger starts at $16.  Husband LOVED it!  I ordered the plain BBQ Bachi Burger Angus Beef with Cheddar Cheese.  Thrilling, I know.  I'm such a risk taker.  It was very good and however they cook these burgers is incredible.  It had a slight crispness on the outside, but still juicy on the inside (even ordered well done!).  The bun was perfectly soft, but not too much so that it dissolved around the burger.  Sweet potato fries were really good.  Perfectly cooked, not underdone or overdone.  I was really bummed they don't have ranch.  I mean, what else do you dip your sweet potato fries in?!  I didn't like the accompanying Yuzu Citrus Aioli, so I asked to try the Garlic Chili Aioli, which they charged us 50 cents for.  I hate being nickel and dimed for things like that, especially when I ended up not liking it.  Oh well.  Overall, I'd say my rating would probably be a 3 and the husband would give it 4-5, so I'll round up because I think not liking their creative sauces is a personal problem.  Definitely not a bad place to stop on your way into Vegas, or if you want to get off-strip for a bit while you're in town.",

When you come here you forget all the money you've lost and end the trip on a happy note! I personally love onions and egg on my burger and so I recommend getting the Miyagi Burger! It goes for about $13.50. Then add some fries and a coke and the total should come out to around 20 usually. The first time I had the oxtail chili cheese fries and found a hair in it, but they were so nice they gave us a whole new chilli cheese fries and all the drinks were free (about a group of 10-12 of us). The meat they use and bread is just different. It is like the first meal they give you once you get to Heaven. lol I might be over exaggerating, but its definitely my favorite burger (better than Umami, DogHaus, In-n-out, etc).  Recommendations Dont come into the place thinking of all the hype you hear and just judge it for being such great quality. A bit pricey, but not some where you go to eat everyday either. Be ready to spend at least 20 if you want a meal.",

The Bahn Mi was our favorite. The depth and range of flavors are indescribably delectable deliciousness.  Only critique, the Parmesan truffle fries are quite unappetizing to look at. Taste is, okay. The appearance of runny brown sauce on top was unexpected. If it were described as a gravy sauce on the menu it would have been less of a shock. Not what we imagined Parmesan cheese fries to look like. A positive, the dipping sauce that accompanies the fries is 100% tasty. Scrape off the brown slime and dip away.  The servers are on their mark. Great knowledge of the products, good descriptions and attentive. Waiter forgot my iced coffee, but was easily forgiven since after the very satisfying meal it was time for a bit of eat and sleep.  Aloha!",

The sauce that came with it gave it another whole level of goodness. The sweet potatoes fries tastes so fresh!   Tried the truffle fries. Those were yummy. Prices are decent",

The first time, it was evident that the quality of meat was way better than what most of us are used to. Today, it didn't seem that way. The service was good, no issue there, we got there when they opened which seems to be my thing. I like to avoid the crowd. We ordered the Kiki and Black and Green Burger, we ordered them medium rare. Like most reviews, it was basically well done, a bit dry. It didn't taste bad but there is a difference in taste. And my burger, Black and Green, said it had blue cheese and I don't think it did, it's not a subtle flavor. The app was good, spinach and artichoke dip, we ran out of chips so we used our fries.   Overall, it wasn't bad, it was ok. The flavors are good and it won't hurt you to check this place out. I'd go again to try the Shogun burger.",

The salads were also not properly portioned with one having 1.5x more greens than the other. It was noticeably more. The waitress explained they have a new hire and it was his first time making salad. They just gave the missing ingredients on separate plates so the people who got salads could mix it in themselves. I have no clue how you can completely fuck up a salad. Makes me wonder... Is he smart enough to know he needs to wash his hands before salad prep? Is he high? Was there training? Can he see that there was way too much dressing? Is he blind? If he knew he put too much dressing, why not start over? Does he care? I mean whats going on?????",

Miyagi-San's burger (wagyu beef, chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings) - I asked for it to be cooked medium rare, just as how I like my steaks cooked, but I think I'd like it medium next time. Burger was very juicy and tasty, the fried egg was cooked perfectly with the velvety yolk oozing when I cut the burger in half.   Truffle Parmesan Fries (parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream, sun dried tomato aioli) - I wish these were fried a bit longer, they were too soggy for me. Because of that, the cream made it taste more soggy.  They also have a ramen joint connected next door. Will be back to try their ramen!",

I just can't say I'm fanatical about burgers or adore the ritual of eating one per se... but when the words, \"BACHI BURGER?\" come up during the erratic game of where-should-we-eat, I'll never say no! This place just dresses up the American classic with unconventional ingredients with the Asian fusion twist -- like ox-tail meat chili, pickled vegetables, or a runny sunny-side-up egg. Everything is just so full of creative flavor that always leaves you satisfied!  FOR HER: - The seasonal MANGA BURGER (grilled wagyu burger topped with crab & scallop dynamite, sunny side up egg, enoki mushrooms & kaiware sprouts). I also order an iced matcha green tea, which comes with unlimited refills (costs 4$).  FOR HIM:  - The specialty bbq burger, KIKI'S BURGER (angus beef, sauteed enoki/shitake/eryngli mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmelade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli). We also both got an order of the TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES (fries topped with parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream, with a side of sun dried tomato aioli).  They have happy hour Monday thru Friday from 3pm-6pm, which includes 4$ draft beers, 5$ milkshakes (non-alcoholic), 6$ sangria, & 7$ wine/cocktails/alcohoilc milkshakes.   They also offer ramen now as well, which I believe is connected to the restaurant just next door!",

The gravy/braised oxtail is rich and decadent.  The fries are crispy and well-seasoned...and the fried egg just makes it unctuous...the cilantro helps freshen it up a bit.  The banh mi burger is my husband's favorite non-traditional burger of all time because it does remind him of a banh mi sandwich...flavors balanced well, well-cooked burger patty...really good pickled vegetables and lots of fresh cilantro.  I used to love their pork belly baos, until I tried Momofuko in NYC...but they are still pretty tasty. Service is pretty good here.  They try to push the food out in an efficient manner and the service team does take care of you.   With all the notoriety from Diners, Drive-ins & Dives, this place has gotten much busier over the years.  Waits can be tedious during peak dining times.  We usually roll on in on our way in and out of Vegas because my husband enjoys it so much.  Thank goodness it's been during off-peak hours because our waits have never been terribly long...30 mins at the most.",

I wish I were able to have stayed longer to enjoy it more, however I was on a very short lunch break and had to rush.  The Bison burger I had was definitely good; however I don't believe it was worth $26 for a burger, fries, a drink, tax and tip, for lunch for 1.  It seemed like an upscale, trendy kind of place that I didn't feel like it was worth the experience.",

    "text": "I ordered the oxtails chili fries based on the multiple rave reviews. Was disappointed in the plate I got! Major flavors were salt and cumin seasoning in the chili gravy. There was not a shred of oxtails that I could see or taste! Could only taste the over powering cumin as if the cook thought he was using black pepper and grabbed the wrong seasoning! Reminded me of canned chili in texture except canned would taste better. Disappointing because I love both home cooked chili and oxtails! The only positive was the egg on top. That was perfectly cooked.   I also ordered a Ronin burger. Great charred taste to go with the sweet onions and coleslaw on it! The burger buns were fresh as tasted good! Glad for the redemption of the Ronin burger because the $50 round trip taxi fare (Saturday, 3pm, light traffic) from the MGM would hurt if I didn't get at least one good plate of food for all I spent!",

My friend ordered the fish sandwich, and I will probably get that next time.  The fish was seasoned so well, and the taste was great.  We also shared an order of sweet potato fries . ..  the sauce tasted like it was horseradish based, which I normally don't like, but it was a nice compliment to the sweetness of the sweet potato fries.  Definitely will be coming back here again.  Just expect to pay gourmet burger prices.",

    "text": "Bachi Burger! Remember that because it's the only place you will ever need to know and go after trying one of their incredibly juicy and delicious burgers.  Here are some tips before you head out there for the first time, assuming you're staying on the strip. Be sure to grab a few (preferably three) of your hungry and adventurous food buddies with you. Then holler a cab and don't forget to get a contact number from the cab driver/company so you can call for a cab when you're done. Bachi Burger is located about twenty minutes away from the strip and there's hardly any cab around that neighborhood. If you don't want to be stranded in the middle of nowhere for hours, remember to get that number. Also, it will run you about $60 cab-fare with tips for round trip. It's not that bad when you split that among four people. Another plus side of having few more people venturing out with you is that you'll get to try few more items on the menu. Yes, it may sound like a lot of hassle and expensive just to try a burger, but that BURGER is worth it!  As for recommendation from the menu, I'd skip Ronin and Kiki Burger and go straight to the juicy and flavorful Miyaki-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger. It's a perfect combination of caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings, fried eggs with chili mayo in the burger. So pull up those sleeves, loosen that belt and get ready for a chow down!",

There were big chunks of meat, not just shredded.  Parmesan-truffle fries are an absolute must!!!! The burgers were cooked to order, and weren't overcooked at all. My plantation iced tea was very refreshing and a perfect compliment to the meal.  You should definitely try this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, peking duck buns, and the miyagi burger. The oxtail chili cheese fries are overhyped; it looks better than it tastes. The peking duck buns were a bit bland, but the miyagi burger was AMAZING. Every bite was juicy and flavorful. The crispy onions in the burger also added a great crunch.

I've had custom burgers at other places and they were much better.  At $16 I feel ripped off...  The fries also I felt were extremely expensive for what I got.  They were clearly not home cut fries but rather frozen fries.  For $4 I feel I should be getting something superior but I'd prefer $1 Mcdonald fries.    Wasn't terrible but way overpriced for the experience.  Felt I should have paid around $10 instead of $20.",

We waited for about twenty minutes before we were finally seated.   I decided to order the Kalbi burger this time around. I was enticed by the kim chi and it definitely delivered. The meat was perfect flavor and was cooked to perfection. I enjoyed the pickled cucumbers quite a bit on the side as well. The bun, which is usually my biggest sticking point for finding a great burger was soft and delicious. My friend's burger was a little on the undercooked side, but still looked good.  Service was a little lackluster and that's the only thing keeping me from giving this place five stars. We waited quite a while to order, then another agonizing wait for our food and then when they finally brought our check, it was incorrect. Another long wait for them to rectify that and we were finally out the door. I wish they came by with refills a little more often as well. Service was friendly, however. I'll definitely be back, but I'll make sure I'm not in a hurry when I do.",

    "text": "My friend Andrew N. heard I was going to Vegas and asked if I've been to Bachi Burger. What burger, I asked?  Bachi burger!  Never heard of it, I said.  Well, it's a fusion burger place off the Strip, and it's supposed to be pretty good. Maybe I'll try it, I said, but thinking I probably won't because we might be too lazy to leave the Strip.   But right after we checked in, my addicted-to-burgers bestie readily agreed to go even though she was sick and didn't have an appetite. Excited that she showed some interest in food, we passed on eating Earl's with our other friends and went to Bachi instead.  When we got there, we didn't have much of a wait since it was kind of late. The interior was pretty open-spaced, simple and clean. We were seated quickly, and my friend wasted no time in ordering her burger AND fries despite having the flu! We ended up with the miyagi-san's grass fed wagyu burger, black and green burger, and truffle parmesan fries.  Behold the burgers: miyagi sans (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=8YjaanPy1nCGW0crojJDkw#8YjaanPy1nCGW0crojJDkw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN...</a>) and black and green (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=8YjaanPy1nCGW0crojJDkw#FKU28v4IVPeZhS-fTYmpnw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN...</a>).  Wasn't sure how I was supposed to eat the miyagi-sans burger because it was stacked pretty high, but it sure was tasty. Grass-fed wagyu with fried egg, chili mayo, carmelized bacon, and onion crisps. The flavors were prominent, and the oozing egg yolk on top of a juicy patty was delicious.  The black and green burger was pretty good, but not as good in my opinion. It was slightly more bland with an earthly, sweet taste.   The fries were drizzled with black truffle porcini cream that was pretty good. Not amazing though. It also came with a sun-dried tomato aoili, which was unnecessary because it didn't pair well with the fries.   It was a good meal overall though. If you're looking to get off the Strip for a while, I would say give Bachi Burger a try if you like fusion burgers!",

I have to say the food in general is on the sweet side. Don't really like that, but they seriously don't mess with food.  I got the shogun burger the most expensive burger: too sweet, foie gras was slightly undercooked (or is it supposed to be not sure), and the eel tasted fishy. I suggest eat it all there. Taking the leftovers makes the hamburger smell even more. No bueno. I would not get this the second time, but it was worth trying. My friends and I ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, sweet potato fries, and kale salad. The sides were bomb!!! I have to say ya'll have to try all 3!!!  I would definitely love to come back for other items on the menu. Thank you!",

The Steamed Buns have seared pork belly seasoned just right. It's a great starter. The oxtail chili fries are so different that you just can't slow down when eating them, which you should because the Burger that is coming next is just delicious. I had the Binh Burger that's made with beef port, and shrimp. Yes, shrimp.  Try the Thatch Tea to accompany your meal.   Great service in s little restaurant way off of downtown or the strip.",

I honestly should have went somewhere else with the amount of money spent. We showed up around 8:30pm and the place was reasonably busy. We placed our order around 8:45pm (burgers and fries). The burgers came out a little over an hour later. Not only did we wait an unreasonable amount of time for our burgers, my burger was not cooked as I requested therefor I had to wait longer. Also, the fries did not come out until 20 minutes after we received our burgers and they were cold on top of that! Sadly, with my experience with Bachi Burger tonight, I will not be returning nor recommending this place to anyone.",

We ordered some nice cold brews that they have on tap as the waiter made menu recommendations to us. We decided on the oxtail chili cheese fries as an appetizer which was very good however it did have more chili then I would've liked  but that didn't stop me from eating half the plate. We ordered the Miyagi-San burger which is their most popular burger which was 5/5. The spicy miso burger which had a good kick to it and also 5/5. The Kalbi burger which comes with a side of kimchi also 5/5. Burgers were perfectly cooked and the buns had a nice toasty crunch to it.  Prices range from $9 for a basic burger and extra for add ons to $15 for their gourmet burgers. A bit pricey for a burger joint but their gourmet burgers are very filling and portions are huge and can be shared. I will definitely be returning!",

    "text": "I love how this place is open until 2AM! It's a great place to satisfy those late night cravings for foie gras! *  We ordered:  1. Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries ($11.50) Oxtail is so good! The braised oxtail fries come with garlic aioli sauce along with a fried egg. The fries are very savory. Some people might not like it because there is a hint of sweetness. My defense is that it's supposed to balance the overall taste and not make it uber salty. A must try! (5/5)  2. Shogun Burger ($25)  I only got this because of the foie gras! Get it while you can since who knows when the government wants to make it illegal as well in Nevada! The burger has delicious Wagyu beef and unagi (marinated eel), pan-seared foie gras, miso butter, and poached Asian pear.   The server told us to eat the Yamamomo Peach first (it's in a little cup) because it's supposed to cleanse our palates to fully taste the foie gras and burger. Neat! Overall, I really liked the foie gras. However, the combinations of the other elements made the burger taste too sweet for me. I felt like they could do without the pear and the unagi. The foie gras was the saving factor. (4/5)  The place is located way off the Strip, so be prepared to make a bit of a drive (not too bad though). The service is friendly and there's cute art decor around the restaurant. There are other yummy burgers on the menu that I would like to try again next time. =)",

They were out of the pork that goes in the Ramen so they substituted bacon and the meals were inedible. Even worse it took 20 minutes for glasses of water to come out and they were not served until after the meal. Each employee was seen taking a bite of food before exiting the kitchen and chewing throughout the restaurant and even at tables while taking orders, the hostess was even involved in this. They asked to take home the noodles and were told there were no to go containers they \"couldn't find them.\" We will just go somewhere else and tell everyone we know to do the same. There's too many hard workers out there to deal with this poor poor service.",

This all speaks to how shady this business is and them not wanting the truth to be seen by the pubic.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Update on same visit 3 days later: I just got my credit card bill today and this restaurant charged me and extra $5 without my approval for my takeout order! I'm contesting it through my credit card company which means this restaurant will pay a penalty in addition to the amount contested. They just shot themselves in the foot!!  I HATE dishonest restaurants that pulls these kinds of SCAM! They will FOREVER lose a customer and I will tell every single one of my friends to NEVER visit any of their locations!!  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Food is very tasty! Very popular so be prepared to wait awhile.  I'm really not into burgers but I do love Japanese food. Since foie gras is banned in California I have to get my fix in vegas! When I saw the shogun burger with foie gras on their menu, I had to go and try it. Everything on the menu is a la carte, so you have to order fries salads separately. I ended up doing takeout because I had to rush back to work. The restaurant is clean but packed on a weekday afternoon, parking was not easy.  The shogun burger was excellent, and well worth the $25. The Kalbi burger was good too, although the kimchi overpowered the Kalbi and I felt like I just got a mouthful of fermented spicy veggies. The pork belly buns I really enjoyed.  Would come back to try the fries next time.",

It used to be two separate restaurants with the same owners, but then they knocked out the wall and made it one big restaurant with two kitchens. Yes, as others have said it is a bit pricey. But it's always good and fresh. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night be prepared to wait. And the waiting area is super tiny so you will likely be waiting outside.   The Bachi pickles are really different! It is about six types of pickled items including pickled garlic, pickled radish, pickled carrots. It sounds kind of weird and when it came to our table I didn't think it looked very appetizing but each type of pickle was completely delicious!  Another great appetizer are the brussels sprouts. But they do come with a sprinkling of bacon so if youre  vegetarian beware.   Unfortunately, my entree came out about 10 minutes before my dates entree. I think it's because we ordered from the two different kitchens. (One ramen one burger) But even that was OK.",

    "text": "This should have been an update from a previous review that I did, like 4 years ago. I don't know where that review went, for some unknown reason, it was deleted. I think it was about the chicken wings, and that I only gave them 3 stars or something. I've been back here many times since then, and this place is steadily a very good place to munch on a burger. Or anything else that comes to mind.  I recently came back here, after a couple of years, on a whim. I don't know why but for some reason, I feel like I should come back here once in a while. They say that Bachi was inspired by Umami Burger in LA. That could be True or not. But, Bachi is one of those few follow-ups which is better than the original.  I've tried pretty much the entire menu here. Burger-wise, I am one of the few that believe that their Angus is better than their Wagyu. If both meats are temp'd at medium rare, I think their Angus is much more juicier and tender then the Wagyu. Call me crazy. Or call me, maybe.  Still, to this day, I haven't tried their oxtail fries. Or maybe I did. If I did, then I think it tasted pretty good. If I haven't, then I couldn't tell you. Also, they are now connected to Shoku Ramen, so you can get ramen if you don't want a burger. Which is fine, I guess.  I'll probably be back. For some reason, I still get a little irked when I see that I've paid $25 (including tax and tip) for a burger, fries, and Coke. But, i'll get over it. Maybe.",

The reviews were pretty good, but still I wasn't sure if the eastern western fusion of flavors would work. I felt more at ease with our wonderful server Theresa. She made a bunch of great recommendations to me and our Vegas party.  I ordered the Miyagi-San burger... it was delicious. The flavors and textures all worked well together.  An order of salt-pepper garlic fries and Thai ice tea completed my order. Dessert items looked tempting,  but I didn't want to get to \"hate myself level\" full, so I passed on dessert.  As for the wait, it took maybe 5-7 mins to get seated for a party of 5. I'd say we were there around 4pm or so.  I did try some ramen that someone in my party ordered... both the ramen and broth were very tasty. The pork was melt in your mouth tender and had a good amount of flavor.  Overall, good food, very clean, and friendly customer service.  When I come back to Vegas, this is a joint I wouldn't mind hitting up again.",

I can't say enough good things about this place, we arrived around 10:30 and it was still full but we were able to be seated pretty quickly.  The fries are served a la Carte and they are big enough to share with another person. If you have more people, I would suggest trying all three types they serve.  They also have tons of burgers from beef to lamb to vegetarian and fish!   My boyfriend had the Black and Green with Wagyu, mushrooms, spinach, bacon, blue cheese and garlic and he couldn't stop raving about it and actually said \"perfect burger, so good!\"  And I had the Bachi fish sandwich and it was delicious!!! It was pan seared to a nice crispy finish which was just delectable and the flavor combination is seriously amazing!    Oh and they have adult milkshakes!!! What???   I would most definitely go back again just to get the truffle Parmesan fries!!!",

I ordered a 7oz burger well done and it was exceptionally delicious, which is why it got 3 star instead of two stars.  They missed two points for the following two reasons:  1) My iced tea literally took 15 minutes to receive and I had to remind the server twice!  2) Food came out sporadically instead of all together, when I was here with a party of four.  Also, the hostess will not seat anyone unless all of your party is here.  I find the serving of food separately to be very rude to the party you're with, because you can't enjoy it all once.  Food is great, but there are some key elements that be should be improved upon.",

In my opinion it is a little over priced since it doesn't come with fries or anything ( $15 for the Miyagi).   We had the Miyagi-San and the Kiki's. The burger came  cooked more medium rare than medium but it was not a big deal. The sauce on the Miyagi was definitely the best part. It was perfectly sweet while still allowing you to taste the burger.   If you are worried about the egg in your burger, don't you worry; it is amazing. The egg provides another great dimension of taste and texture.   The to go service was mediocre but I understand on a busy night it is hard to provide excellent service to take-out customers.   I would eat it again. Top 10 burgers I have ever had. Oh yeah the fries are really good (they are like pomme frites).",

    "text": "Wow, Bachi Burger does everything right. Asian fusion meets the bun and holy shit does it ever fucking work. My only gripe? Bachi Burger needs a location in LA! Seriously, this place puts all the other burger joints to shame. I mean, this is what Umami Burger should be doing.   Bachi Burger is located 5 miles to the southeast of the Strip in a non-descript shopping center. Being the noObs that we were, the wife and I could not figure out which side the entrance was located at (it's on the north side by the way). Once we entered we were lucky enough to be seated because this place was fucking packed.   After perusing Yelp reviews, we decided to order the famous oxtail chili cheese fries. All I have to say is thank you Yelp for recommending the oxtail chili cheese fries because they were amazing. The chef is Japanese Hawaiian and the minute you see the fries you will see the Hawaiian influence because there was a perfectly cooked fried egg on top! The portion of the fries was huge. As an appetizer, it could easily be shared with 4 people. Aside from the egg and fries, it consisted of tender oxtail meat, cheese, scallions, jalapenos, sriracha mayo, garlic aioli, chili, and beans. I mean the combination of these ingredients was simply bliss. My wife and I hardly spoke because we were devouring the mountain of fries like fucking barbarians.   As for the burgers, my wife had the Kiki Burger and I had the Miyagi Burger. The Kiki Burger was really something. Thick and juicy Angus beef, three different types of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, gruyere cheese, and a sriracha-mayo sauce... oh heaven! As for my Miyagi Burger, it consisted of thick and juicy wagyu meat with furikake (nori flakes), caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings, fried egg and mayo. It was good... a little on the sweet side... let' just say that I liked my wife's burger a little better. Also, if you aren't into fusion burgers, they have a regular Angus burger that you can customize.   So, we were unable to finish our meal. Too much fucking food. I can't remember the last time I went to a gourmet burger joint and was unable to finish my burger. I think my only suggestion for Bachi Burger is that they should offer a sampler platter because they have so many unique burgers and it was a shame that I couldn't try more.   Bachi, I fucking heart you.   *One thing my wife and I noticed was that  a requisite to work here is that you need to be Asian with arm tattoos. But don't let the tats scare you because the servers are super sweet like ramune.",

    "text": "I can definitely see why people are fans of this place. However, I'm not in that boat.  Let's start with the wait. We came at a time where it should have been well after lunch time rush but there was still a 20 minute wait. If I'm driving into the middle of nowhere, the food better be damn good!  We ordered the Mr. Ho's burger and the oxtail chili cheese fries.   The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: While it was interesting and enjoyable, it's not something I personally would crave. Was it tasty? Yeah I suppose... but the fries itself isn't specially made extra good. While eating it, I couldn't help but compare them to McDonald's fries. They were 11-12 dollars.   The Mr. Ho's Burger: I definitely had better burgers! The bun was taro flavored, or so its said, and therefore it's purple. Unfortunately, you're not able to taste any subtleties because the sauce was so overpowering. We split this burger and I'm raised with the voice of my parents saying there are starving children in Africa if a grain of rice is left on my plate, even till today, but I simply couldn't finish this half of my burger because of how strong and over-applied the sauce was. And this was only half a burger. This was also about 12 dollars.   Perhaps the rest of the menu items are sublime, that's a possibility. But there was definitely a disconnect between the food I got and the raving reviews. It's hip and trendy and could very well be a spot in the middle of West Hollywood or Downtown LA, but I'm very sorry to say it felt like this place was more hype than substance. I know I'm definitely in the minority on this.  Overall: Like the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, don't regret getting it but I wouldn't do it again.",

    "text": "I really do enjoy BachI Burger. I have been here about four times now, and they do not disappoint. Now that they have combined with Shoku Ramen, I enjoy it even more.   One of my favorites is the spicy miso ramen.  It's done extremely well, but it's not all that spicy, so if you are looking for something extremely spicy, this is not going to satisfy that craving. However, I do have a very high tolerance for spicy food, so it's worth noting that I might not think it's spicy, but it might be spicy for others. The serving size is on par with most other ramen joints.  As for burgers, my favorite is the Kiki Burger. It is filled with hearty mushrooms and the flavor combination is amazing. No complaints here. The burger is huge and done right.   The truffle garlic fries are also one of my favorites. It's a wonderful combination and I have to get it every single time...even if it's with my ramen.   The service is good here and it has a hipster vibe...I'll leave value judgements about the atmosphere up to the individual, but it's a fun vibe. Overall, always extremely impressed and enjoy them very much.   The only caveat to all of this is how busy they can get, and deservingly so.  The wait has stopped me from eating here a few times, but if you try to get here during down times it's not too bad. If it's a rush hour though, be prepared to wait. My latest time eating here was this past Thursday night around 6:00 pm and there was no wait at all.",

As for the food, I really do not understand the hype surrounding Asian flavors in hamburgers.

If that's what you like, then you'll love this place. I actually am pretty happy with regular hamburgers and regular Asian food. The price: The burgers cost way more than they really need to cost. You get one burger, nothing else. I also have to agree with a lot of other reviewers here about how their hostess treats you. She was NOT nice. Basically could have been a robot taking names.

I have been in the business for 18 years now, from front of the house to being a chef.  To be honest, I do not like to be rushed when I just barely sat down and have not seen the menu!  Anyways, enough with the bitching!  Food so far is not bad , came out fairly quick though?  Hmmmm?   Pork belly bao,  great flavor on point but came out cold! Like it's been sitting in the kitchen for a minute.  Portions on the onion rings? Too little for the portion...  Like I said, food is good. But service could be better!",

The sauce had a weird sweet taste. It would have been good had they omitted whatever they put to make it sweet. I split the burger with the hubby, and while it was good it wasn't anything special.  The pork buns were yummy, but this seems like one of those \"trend\" foods that everyone is trying to do. You really can't go wrong with these and they were good.  Service was good, I would probably go back and order other things to try.",

When I think of Burgers I think of Bachi Burger.  Too bad I am so far away.  Best crabcake.  Best sweet potato fries.  Best dipping sauces.  My first try of a Bao Sandwich (Pork Belly Steamed Buns).  Bring a friend because you are going to want to try as many menu items as possible.  Fantastic menu with great thought put into pairing of flavors and ingredients.  I dream of Bachi Burger often.

The chili was a little too sweet as if there was too much bbq sauce, but still good!   - Pork Belly Steamed Sandwiches: Glazed pork belly, hardboiled egg, and cilantro stuffed in a steamed bun. YUM, although the bun could've been a little softer.  - Miyagi-san grass-fed wagyu burger: grass-fed beef patty, cheese, onion rings in toasted buns. I loved that this came out hot and steamy! Although the beef patty was cooked to medium-well even though I asked for medium, it was still very juicy. However, I felt that it lacked flavor and I wished the onion rings would have been crunchy to give the burger more texture.  I would definitely come back here again because it has so many burgers that sound delicious! However, I give this four stars because I think they could've done with all their entrees.",

I ordered Salted Caramel Milk Shake for (6$) and Oxtail Fries for (11$ich). I came to pick it up, yes I okay I understand it takes sometime and I am patient enough to wait for good foods. The lady ( blonde hair who looks old than the other two girls) she gave me my shake ( half of the plastic cup )  and told me that they ran out of whip cream and caramel and it does not even look like in the picture than I expect it from other reviews. I told her that this is not what I saw in the picture of yelp, but then she said mayb it was the different place, I checked on my phone and yes it said it was on windmill branch ( they have two branches) I told her its okay, its just half of the cup and I am not taking it. I would like my money back if she can so refund. The other girls said that I can put more caramel and whip cream if you want ( the blonde hair girl just said that they ran out of whip cream oh! Incredibly, now you guys have whip cream when I want to refund my money ) I was giving an attitude by two girls even tho they are trying to fix my drink, but I don't want half of cup when I actually paid for the full amount of ($6) the drink she gave me worth around 2$ I could've gotten that from fast food place and it would taste better than this. Was so disappointed and will not be returned. I gave one star thanks to the girl that do refund for me and yes I did take my food and it does not taste good at all. I would avoid at all costs!!!",

The burgers are gourmet, Japanese fusion burgers, but so delicious! First off, their quality of meat is great. The ground beef is very tender and juicy, not dry at all. They also offer so many choices of burgers that are so interesting!   -If you really want to splurge, try the Shogun burger. It's the best burger I've ever had, hands down. -Miyagi-san is definitely the best burger if you don't want to take risks. It's not bad, it's a GREAT burger! But if you're not feeling some of that fusion stuff. -The Ronin Burger was awesome. It had so many layers of taste; my friends and I decided that it tastes somewhat like a sushi roll. Sounds weird, but it's really goooood. -Kiki burger is a really good mushroom burger! -Their oxtail chili cheese fries were HUGE. And delicious! However, like everyone else, I do wish for a bit more oxtail in it. But nonetheless, bomb. -Their truffle fries are amazing too! Definitely my favorite truffle fries I've had yet. Not dry at all! Crispy and moist. -Mr. Ho burger. If you like sweet taro bun and pork sausage, try it. It's a bit on the Chinese bun side, it was very interesting, but I couldn't finish it because it was a bit sweet for a burger.  Never had Umami Burger, but my friends at the table are quite the foodies and had quite of a bit of Umami Burger... Bachi blows Umami right out of the water.  Prices are around $9-$15 per burger (except the Shogun, that one is $25), but the burgers are HUGE. Eating just the burger alone, you'll be stuffed. Thick patties, fat bun. No skimping here.  Damn, now I'm hungry talking about all this food.  5 stars!",

I should probably try other items but why fix something that isn't broken? Also truffle fries are awesome!   The staff here are very friendly and try to strike up conversations with the customers, that's always pleasant.  All in all, I will come here again. Especially because tourists seem to love it.

Very busy, yet we were immediately seated since the other parties consisted of high volume of guests while I was with just one other. A plus for that!  Upon seating, the waitress courteously greeted us and asked us if it was our first time. Confirming with her question, she gave her suggestion and what is considered the most popular three burgers on the menu. The Ronin, Kikis, and Banh-Mi burger is supposedly the most popular and preferable. My girlfriend ordered the Kikis and I ordered the Banh-Mi.   I normally like my meat cooked in medium rare, however, the server suggested that we cook it to medium well because our patties are more than just beef. My patty consisted of shrimp and pork so medium rare would be overdoing these meats. So my girlfriend and I took her advice.  We waited about 20-30 minutes for our burger. Though busy, that is quite long.  Finally after waiting, our burgers and one serving of \"just fries\" came.   My burger was good but not great. I have definitely tried much better. Nevertheless, I did enjoy this unique style of burger. On the other hand, my girlfriend's Kiki's burger was delicious. It could use more veggies and more dressing but the meat combined with the bacon was stellar.   Overall, an OK experience. My rating and review is definitely subject to change because my curiosity will bring me back to try the other burgers/ fries/ etc.",

    "text": "Every trip I make to Las Vegas usually includes one dining experience away from The Strip, which is easy because I always rent a car for golf purposes. Bachi Burger was my choice on this trip and it was a winner. While this original location is rather small, it is still very comfortable, clean and recently underwent a modest renovation. I won't say it is unlike any other burger destination, but I will say that the burgers themselves are very unique. Good flavor in every bite and really appreciated how the servers asked about food allergies when ordering because of the nature of the menu options. They also have full-liquor and many other drink and food options if your taste takes you beyond simply a burger and a beer. When playing golf in the area on a future trip, this will definitely be my 19th hole.",

They live down the street and eat there often.  They'd totally get a four+ stars if the service was better.  The decor was great and the menu looked very interesting - I love fusion cooking.  I ordered the Spicy Miso Burger - it was amazing!  Cooked perfectly, juicy and a great flavor combo.  The service was ok at best.  Our waiter spoke broken English and brought foods out in waves.  Finally, after we all had our burgers, the waiter asks what else we needed.  We're like, uh french fries.  By the time we got our fries, we were half way done with our burgers and the fries were cold.",

    "text": "First off, I only review burgers.  Heard about this place from my friend Les.  Went here with my mom who is NOT a burger fan.  I wanted to order 2 to split with her so I could try 2 burgers so I was going to pass on the fries.  She said, get the fries, I'll eat my share.  After the food arrived, she appeared to be enjoying the meal.  I asked her, \"What is the best burger you've ever had?\"  Her answer...\"This one.\"  Update: Buns are like honey glazed dim sum baked Cha Siu Bao.  PERFECTION!  Currently the undisputed best burger in the Las Vegas area for me.  WHAT I ORDERED:   Ronin Burger - 5/5 very juicy and flavorful!  Shogun Burger - 4/5 also very juicy and flavorful!  Kalbi Burger - 4/5 solid!  Garlic Salt & Pepper Fries - 4/5 awesome complement to the main attraction  Truffle Parmesan Fries - 3/5 ok...not sure what the brown sauce was.   Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - 3/5 ok, but not memorable enough to order again  STAFF:  Nice.  Our waitress was quick and friendly and sported some cool tattoo work.  WAIT TIME: Went a little early on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait.  PORTION:  Good portion. Just the right size.   BANG FOR YOUR BUCK  The portions and quality of burger match the price well.  WOULD I RETURN  Yes!",

There is boba so that is a huge plus if you are having that asian craving inside you, I know everyone has it. Service is great and I always leave happy and full.

Brief highlights of what I ate-   Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries- The chili is the best part of this dish, got a decent little kick and melds well with the cheese and fries. The runny egg yolk on the top was also a great touch. Fries were cooked well enough to withstand the barrage of liquid from the other toppings. Our group destroyed these fries pretty quickly  Miyagi-san's burger- Great burger. The bacon/egg/onion ring combo is a classic set of burger toppings, but this burger took it to another level. Great quality ingredients that were combined very well.   All in all, this place blew me away. After trying one of the traditional burgers, I'm even more excited to come back and try the build your own burger option.",

Not being very hungry, we ordered the Pork belly steam bun, kiki's burger, and ronin burger.  We went for the pork belly instead of the duck for steamed bun because it is all about the fat. They grilled the pork belly to perfection. The fluffiness and chewiness of the steamed bun combined with the crusty, melt-in-you-mouth goodness, the buns were gone in a minute.  I was sold when I read that there is shiitake mushroom and other mushrooms in the Kiki's burger along with caramelized bacon, onion marmalade, gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli. For me to finish a burger when I am not very hungry, you know how delicious this burger is.  My companion ordered the ronin burger with the wagyu patty and fried egg. It looked impressive, but tasted alright in comparison to my kiki's.   Great place if you have a car when you visit Las Vegas. You will not be disappointed. Did I mention my Kiki's burger was only $11? Tell that to someone in California or New York, they'd be pissed!",

Our server was really nice and helpful, he knew we were hungry so we jumped right into ordering.  Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu Burger - Delicious, probably my fav Kiki's Burger - the mushrooms seems a bit misplaced, wish they weren't so soggy, but everything else was super juicy Oxtail fries with fried egg - MUST GET THIS TO SHARE, so bomb, it's like canto restaurant indo fried rice but on fries instead.  All in all, is this the best burger place in Vegas? Probably not. Is this the best bang for the buck burger? Hell yes. These burgers are roughly $11 and they are delicious for the price you're paying compared to other burger spots on the strip.",

Thought them to be foodie restaurant .. Leading edge....they gave us a coupon to go to their other restaurant 10 miles away.....Really?  Went to Zenshin close by.... Vote with your feet!",

I am from San Francisco and this reminds of a place I might frequent back home -- they're just with it on many levels. The Bahn Mi burger is amazing, and they're burger with the Kimchi is amazing too. The only criticism I have is that sometimes the sauces are a little too sweet, but it's a small complaint. My taste buds are still thanking me and my meal was hours ago.",

It was really good.  The fried egg on top just made it even better.  The ox tail meat was savory and soft, melt in your mouth.  I tried the Ronin Burger, which is the most popular but I didn't really like it.  There was too much carmelized onions which I usually love but it made the burger too sweet.  My husband had the Miyagi-san's Wagyu Burger and it was so awesome!!  I ate half of his burger.  It was really savory and just good.  I wanted to try their Boba drinks but I was too full after.  I can't wait to go back again!",

I'm going to go ahead and say that the Shogun burger($26) is easily the best burger I have ever had. The price is high but omfg the taste was off the charts.  What really drew me to order it was because I wanted to try what foie gras tasted like for the first time and it did not disappoint. It's a perfect burger to me.  Juicy patty, fatty truffle foie gras, sweetness from the pear, and the soft crispy crunch around the edge of the bun.  It had all the right textures and flavor.  We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries like everyone recommended and it was damn good.  We also ordered the Kiki and Spicy Miso burgers.  I didn't really care for them after trying the shogun burger though.  Angus patty wasn't as good as the wagyu but don't get me wrong, they were still good burgers.  Little things bothered me with each burger like how the spicy miso burger had too much sauce for my taste and the bacon in the kiki burger was a salty pop that I thought was too much at times.  Service was top notch.  Server and hostess were great and empty plates and trash were never on the table for more than 3-5 minutes.  Water was always topped off.  Places like this is what 5 star ratings are for.",

I'm sad to say that the quality has gone way down since my last visit a year ago.  On my visit yesterday, I ordered my usual: Duroc Pork Belly Steamed Buns and a Banh Mi Burger.   My first hint that something was off was when the waitress insisted that I order the Banh Mi Burger cooked medium, because it contains pork. In the past, I was always told by the server that medium rare was best - and safe because \"we know where our pork comes from, and it's safe.\"  The Pork Belly Steamed Buns were tough and chewy. Very disappointing, as they were always soft and heavenly in the past.  Worse still was the Banh Mi Burger, which was missing the signature \"Pork Pate,\" and had a slice of Iceberg Lettuce in place of the usual fresh herbs (as I remember, usually cilantro and mint). I also couldn't find any shrimp in the burger (in the past the shrimp were plentiful).   By the way, the burger wasn't bad, it was merely inferior to the way it used to be.  Bachi Burger is no longer a Las Vegas must experience, sorry to say.",

Being a Karate Kid fan, intuition had me deciding on Miyagi-san's Burger (although I'm not sure if that was their intention...) with Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries and a short Sapporo.   I would highly recommend getting this burger. Although lacking in fresh veggies (which isn't a problem), this wagyu burger has a smokiness and flavor unlike similar burger places e.g. Umami Burger. The list of ingredients is not as extensive as the other burgers, but simplicity makes this burger stand out. This sported chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and onion rings.   The garlic fries were delicious as well. Compared to say Coco's Curry House's garlic fries, the seasoning is very well distributed and flavorful. Paired with the garlic chili aioli, I would highly recommend these fries to any first timer.",

It's prob a 4.5 but I give it to you bachi burger...you get the 5!   I think this place has got it all and it's definitely damn unique. That oxtail chili cheese fries were seriously out of this world hearty goodness. You topped that off with that beautiful sunny side up egg was simply perfection. I can't even find a flaw in this dish because it has everything I love in the dish. Just enough jalopeno to have a little kick to the fries and those beautiful cilantro to further enhance the flavor. The oxtail were seasoned well and it was almost melt in your mouth. If you really want to complain about it, it is simply because it is one of those dishes that will give you an instant heart attack. I totally recommend sharing it between 2-3 people and then ordering a burger.   I also got the Miyagi-San burger which totally reminds me of Karate Kid. ANYWAY...I was reading the descriptions and it had Onions rings and kobe beef patty and i was like bring it on baby. I totally recommend patting it a bit before you take a bite so it will stay together when you eat. When I took my first bite, I simply went OOOOOOO. That patty was simply juicy as hell and those onions rings were the real eye opener. They weren't your typical onion rings because they fried those onion rings with tempura battered which made it extremely delicious. I totally recommend it!  IF I WAS GONNA CHOOSE BETWEEN THE BURGER OR THE FRIES, I SAY IT BE A TOUGH CHOICE BUT GO WITH THE FREAKING FRIES. WHERE ELSE ARE YOU GONNA GET OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES THAT SENDS PEOPLE STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN WORLD.   Vegas must bound place.",

I asked for a table as I wanted to settle down and have a beer. Hostess, even though there was over four tables (four tips) open, would not allow me to sit. She said, \"go to the bar.\"  I don't want to go to the bar, I want to order a beer at a table as my family is right behind. \"Well, we don't have enough servers.\"  Really?  Then who served the table as soon as my wife arrived. Horrible service, and even worse: attitude, from the hostess.   Hostess is the front line and if they are not \"people persons,\" you're dead. They are dead!  As soon as we sat down, we thought there were pieces of chips, or something, on the table and tried to wipe them away. Wrong! It was chips of paint out of the table. Bad appearance, and in showbiz or restaurant biz, appearance IS EVERYTHING.  Bus boy said everyone is complaining about the appearance and we should let managment know. We didn't see management and with their issues that is quite evident. Maybe THEY are the issue.   It gets worse.   My son orders a burger with fries and a Coke. My wife orders a veggie burger the pickle plate with a beer. I order soba noodles and foie gras for the appetizer, and a draft beer.   Burger comes out, soba and veggie burger.  Five minute later, the fries come out and foie gras. My son had already eaten his burger. My soup sat as I waited.  Nothing is organized or detail oriented.   We ask for another beer. Ten minutes later it arrives.   To their credit, they didn't bill us for the apps as they arrived after dinner.  Food quality good. But the service failures are too much and the attitude in a service business is beyond comprehension. This place is simply mismanaged and no attention to detail.   I'll find a place with food just as good and better energy and less attitude.   NEXT!",

    "text": "5 Stars for the food 2 stars for the ambiance. This burger had to rate in top 5 most delicious burgers I have ever sank my teeth into! The oxtail chili cheese fries were outstanding as well and really filled me up with plenty to share with our group (party of 4). What I didn't expect was the strip mall location with a simple dining room. Nothing fancy as I think Denny's is even a little nicer ambiance. I really think they could class the joint up a bit for the awesome quality of food they serve. It was kind of a mismatch in my mind. The prices are reasonable though and the food is top rate. If you're a burger lover and you want a decent price then definitely visit this off strip location. You taste buds and your wallet will thank you. Regardless of ambiance it is a must try burger! P.S. Service and wait staff also very pleasant and accommodating! Enjoy!!",

Our server informs us that they're out of mushrooms which is supposed to come with one of the burgers I wanted. I ordered the black and green burger which was actually amazing and is the reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars.   We also ordered the parm truffle cheese fries which came out bland and didn't have any flavor. Along with that we ordered the oxtail fries and thought the flavors didn't mix well.   Also our food came out in 45 mins which really felt like 2 hours since it was slow and we were starving. The server explained to us that they had new cooks in the back and that's why it took so long.........  Overall, I really loved my burger but the service and timeliness of food needs to improve.",

Then promptly ignored by the waitress. Ordered right away, but it took awhile. Then the waitress came back and asked how I was enjoying everything lmao. Took the advice of the hostess and ordered Mr Ho burger....AWFUL. Have really liked all other items I'd ordered (which is a lot!) Bahn Mi, Spicy Miso, Kiki, oxtail fries. Ordered the burger medium and when I got it (w/o my iced tea, which I had to ask for) it was completely pink ALL the way through. They called the manager, Frank over. I explained I've been there several times and always satisfied. I asked for a Bahn Mi instead. He made me feel like I was trying to pull a fast one....saying we'll just go back to what you like best. He said the burger was pink bc it contained pork. OMG all the worse. Salmonella anyone? He finally relented and I received a delicious Pork containing Bahn Mi ordered medium (WITHOUT) being completely pink.",

I love the concept and I loved the atmosphere, but I just didn't love the meal.  For me, the Ronin was an average burger with a high price tag -  the meat was a tad overcooked, the egg was a little dry and really got lost on the bun.  The short rib steam buns were good....maybe a little more zing was needed to push it to awesome for me. The Truffle Parmesan Fries were tasty but as another review said - needed more gravy and not that original. I REALLY wanted to heart this place, but I didn't find enough ooomph in my meal to make me a die hard fan.",

Great non-pressure waiter and service, all around awesome...Food was delicious...very stylized preparations, portion sizes and super packed with wonderful, delicate and intense flavors, every ingredient holds its own.....I thought it was great and I'm a foodie....

    "text": "Well, finally after nearly a year or so the wife and I just had dinner at Bachi Burger. Very good overall and we'll be back for sure. I had the Kalbi Burger and wife had the Ronin (first one on the menu). When the burgers came we cut our burgers in half and tasted 1/2 of each. I took a bite of the Ronin and it was just great! I wil have it again. The Kalbi burger was good too, but the Kim Chee essense kind of threw the taste off a bit (and I am Korean too). The hamburger meat is a 10 on the quality scale, this ain't no $1 McDs burger, no no no. Their bun should be the standard for all hamburger buns, it is just a light carrier for the meat and doesn't overpower the other flavors, but not to say it is just a piece of bread either. The sweet potato fries were excellent and so was the regular fries, BUT once again I have a pet peave over those thin shoestring fries, I just never liked them. When I want a french fry, give me a huge steak frie, not those little shoelace fries. The dipping sauces were cute and tasty. Pineapple ketchup was ok, but not my favorite, the wasabi mayo tasting one for the sweet potato fries is much better. All in all a great place and very comfortable and casual. I did my homework and expected a long wait for my burger to come out, but it didn't take but 10 minutes or so. Service is decent and since they've been open a while they seem to have their act together. There are plenty of other selections to choose from and we'll be back to try them again!",

At our table we started with the truffle fries and sweet potato fries (the yuzu citrus sauce served on the side was amazing!).  i ordered the Kiki Burger, but since I'm not much of a red meat eater, substituted the lonely bird patty instead of the beef.  My burger was so good!  I don't know what they put in the patty, but if only I could have that every day!  Wish I could have that recipe!  My husband had a wagyu beef burger, which he says is one of the best he's tasted.  Even our little daughter kept asking for more.  (we should've ordered her her own burger!)  Overall, a very good experience.  I think for the price, the food is exceptional.  My only complaint... they don't yet have a location in the LA area!  I guess we'll just have to put it on our MUST EAT list every time we're in town....",

First off, the beer selection was varied but not daunting. For fries we got both the Sweet Potato and Truffle Parmesan. Truffle fries were good, almost great, except for the dip, which I thought was a mismatch (flipped the dips, I thought they fit better). We got the Ronin, Kiki and fish burgers. Wiped out. Great burgers. We thought the fish was a tad salty though. I wanted to try the Samurai burger, what with its foi gras, but decided, \"next time\". Next time also would include trying their Baos.

I had a half of my Kiki burger, served with sweet onion marmalade and mushrooms (I skipped the cheese and asked for the Garlic chili aoili on the side)  wrapped in a lettuce leaf along with a salad and garlic edamame. Two of the guys in our group tried the Ronin Burger, served with Japenese cole slaw. Another had the \"Lonely Bird,\" a terrific ground chicken and turkey \"Tsukune\" burger.  We all loved the innovative menu and reasonable prices. French fry lovers, rejoice: Bachi serves several varieties of French fries -- Sweet potato (w/citrus aoili) Truffle Parmesan (w/Black truffle porcini cream sun dried tomato aoili) , Garlic salt and pepper and \"Just Fries,\" served with pineapple ketchup.

I live in California and was in Vegas for the weekend so I decided to stop by before heading back to Cali.  First impression of the restaurant- clean and cozy.    Now on to the most important part, the food-  most creative burgers I've ever encountered!  I decided on the Banh mi burger since I love Vietnamese sandwiches.     The burger consisted of pork, shrimp, pate, pickled veg, basil, curry aioli and nam plah dipping sauce. The ingredients were fresh and everything was tasty and delicious.   I also ordered the truffled fries and a boba drink.  Next time I want to try the Ronin burger.  Definitely returning here whenever I'm in town.  The best part is the price!  A processed Big Mac meal is about the same.  Please open in southern California!!",

    "text": "Came in to see what all the hype was about. Will never come back. First off, our waitress was irritatingly fake. The food came out quickly, and considering it was a simple order (plain burger with just cheese and bacon) you would think they would get it right the first time. The burger was undercooked and when we sent it back politely the manager brought out a new plate 10 minutes later and informed us they put on new toppings but the burger was the same. I'm in the food industry and this is against health code and severely frowned upon. Not to mention the fact my girlfriend is pregnant and even though we were polite about the request, our waitress kept staring at us strangely and gave her fake \"how is it now?\" question several minutes after the manager brought out the new plate...made me paranoid that something was altered to the food. I will be calling in to the health dept also known as my friend \"\" \"\" and report them as well as tell everyone I know not to eat at this establishment.",

Our favorite is the Miyagi-San burger.  It was so good, we ordered another one the next evening because we knew we won't be eating it again for a long time!  Hawaii needs one!",

    "text": "My friends took me to this off the strip burger establishment and i enjoyed it thoroughly.  How come the three stars?  It's because of the service unfortunately.  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries; this is probably the only place that has this dish!! It was amazing; if you have not tried stewed oxtail this is the place to taste it; unfortunately when brought out the fries were lukewarm and the waiter said \"oh we forgot to cook it\" Who says that?!?!  Well they took the dish back in and heated it up in the oven and it still still turned out marvelous.  For my main course, I had the Banh Mi Burger which was a spin on the vietnamese sandwich.  The burger meat was cooked perfectly and it had two fish cakes with the vietnamese fish sauce.  It was great.  We also had fish chips (divine!), parmesan truffle fries, and salt and pepper fries.  Unfortunately the service did not match up to the food.  At one point they did not have enough cups to bring us our green tea beverages.  The service put a damper on the great food, but this can be improved.  Keep up the good work with the food! I would come here again though and give them another chance.",

    "text": "Went here for take-out tonight. I almost drove past it and had to make a u-turn on Windmill so be sure you're on the lookout when going. As others have mentioned, parking is behind the restaurant. If you're in a wheelchair you'd have to enter by the subway and go around to the entrance facing Windmill. There's a waiting area with a leather couch and a table near the bathrooms so that was where I waited after placing my order. The server was very polite and quick to assist me, including a cup of hot green tea while I waited. The tea seemed like matcha or a powdered green tea and was pleasant. The food seems a bit expensive but it is indeed tasty-  would be more reasonable at 3/4ths the price. The mango milkshake was very tasty and made my boyfriend happy. I had the jasmine green tea boba and it was just alright. The boba were smaller than at volcano tea and some were a little too soft. An order of the peking duck dumplings has 3 decent sized little buns filled with several slices of duck, radish, herbs and garnish. They're really tasty, with the soft bun complimenting the savory meat. We ordered the Kiki and Banh mi  burgers as well. Both were tasty, with interesting combinations of textures and flavors to deviate from the standard lettuce, tomato and onion combos. Soy flavors had a strong presence in both, as well as a sweetness from either mirin or sugar. My kiki was a well executed medium rare. Unfortunately by the time I got home some of the fries had gotten soft. I personally like them on the softer side, so I didn't mind too much but something crispy lovers might want to consider before doing take-out.  I'd like to go again  to try the other things they have on the menu, perhaps focusing more on appetizers and sides. The japanese pickles and the sausages both sound promising. It's a little out of the way and a little overpriced for me to be a frequent customer, but it's a pleasant change of pace from the routine and an enjoyable restaurant. The interior isn't the most lavishly seated, but I really like the chalk board menu and use of warm-toned, richly glossed woods and marble throughout. The aioli for the fries is very tasty! An outdoor area would also be a nice addition as they have a covered area, but I don't know if their lease or the infernal Vegas heat would permit it. I'll go back in a month or two and update :} I'm curious to see how things evolve here as it has a lot of potential to be an awesome spot. Hopefully once business picks up they can lower their prices a little bit and expand their menu or interior.",

Its yummy, huge and filling. If you like egg on your burger this is the one for you.  I like regular fries with this burger but if I were to order a Kiki or a Ronin the truffle fries are the way to go.  You can't compare Bachi, Five guys. They serve different styles of burgers.

Sure, you have a wide assortment of different toppings you can choose from, and a bunch of different fries to pick from, which will make the adventurous among us very excited, but at the core, the marinated Wagyu patties are the best burger patty around.  If that wasn't enough, great opening plates (try the bao, their steamed pork and duck buns) and some great desserts (the Portuguese donuts) to make it close to the perfect meal.  If I could take away half a star I would.  The service is sometimes inattentive or 100% best service possible, but that is True of most places.",

I had their regular burger with bacon, eggs, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mayo....and....drum roll....the Bacon was really tasty.  That was the only thing that really stood out.  The presentation was good too...But the burger itself was pretty bland.  Maybe ive been spoiled with so many gourmet burger joints in california and vegas....but the bachi version was ok.   I didnt try any of their other specialty version as im not too fond of some of the items.  The seating arrangement was nice, i liked the decor, and service was good as well.  Looked liked they may be able to some outdoor seating?  shrugs...perhaps it is too hot in vegas....  I would come again if i was hosting an out of towner who wanted an away from the strip experience...  we ordered 2 versions of the fries...and both were just a ok.  the truffle fries and some other ones with cilantro in it.    I think they tried to get a bit too creative ... at least for my taste.",

We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries for our appetizer and it's gone in less than a minute. Oh so yummy. Everyone ordered a different burger and they said it is absolutely good. I ordered the most expensive burger which is still priced reasonably for $25. It is called shogun burger. With foie gras (goose liver)  unagi (eel) and some pears. It is the best burger ever! I ordered it well done since I can't risk taking any raw meat, I'm 6 months pregnant. It still came out sumptuous and juicy. We all shared a red velvet milkshake for dessert since all of us are full already. It was definitely worth the wait and we are definitely coming back!",

We ordered the steamed Pork Belly buns as apps and for burgers, the Ronin and Kiki. The buns were interesting, but just a bit better than okay. Glad we ordered it but no reason to get it again. To clarify i probably would order buns again, but a different variety. Now, on to the burgers...  WOW!!! Both burgers (I tried my wife's Kiki) were amazing! I described it to my wife as an explosion in my mouth. Fireworks were going off... The burgers contained a melange of flavors and textures... I actually used the word melange for the first time in my life! It was an orgasm for the mouth. There was sweet and salty and spicy and juicy, crunchy, soft, and crisp...ohhhhh! Give me a moment, I will be okay. We also shared the Garlic Parmesan Truffle fries... Also wow. Strong and intense in flavor there was only so much one can eat in a sitting... as it strains the taste buds, but not in a bad way.  I had Honeydew bobo tea, which was very nice as well, no worse or better than any I have had before, and the wife had the root beer. Since we filled up quickly we took the leftovers home... by 7 am my remaining burger which heated up well in the micro for 20 secs was gone, down the hatch! My wife finished hers cold. 'nuff said!",

Coming from San Diego, I'm used to eating some pretty darn good Asian food which I haven't been able to find around the Strip.  I was talking to my cousin and he suggested I tried Bachi Burger.  He said that they had some pretty good Asian inspired burgers.  Hmm.  Asian fusion burgers.  Sounded interesting enough for me to drive there from center strip area.  Ok, now this place isn't close to the strip but its definitely worth it.  We came here on a week night at around 6pm.  I had the Ronin burger and my GF, the Kalbi burger.  I was impressed as soon as I saw my burger.  Wow, this thing was a mini-monster.  I loved my Ronin burger.  The Kalbi burger was pretty good too but the Ronin was definitely a winner.  Oh and the parmesan truffle fries... awesome!  I wish they came in a larger size.  4 bucks is a lot to spend on fries but the taste was bangin.  I wish they opened a Bachi Burger here in San Diego.  I'd be a regular customer, no doubt.  note.  Weekday late afternoon traffic on LV blvd past the airport is a ______ !!!",

Not much going on but it was cooked just right, seasoned with the right amount of everything and the creamy/slightly tangy dip was Great!!  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: Shreds of oxtail, fries, chili, cheese, garnished with slices of jalapeno with a fried egg right on top!! Too good to be True! Geez, now this is one of those \"get down and sloppy\" type of dishes!! Unfortunately, I did not like the flavor of the oxtail, nor the chli..

I was so exctied I didn't order the magazine featured burger but  went with the first \"Specialty Burger\" on the list:  Ronin Burger: caramalized onions, japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, sweet bread bun, yuzu citrus aioli on the side for dipping (taste like horseradish blue cheese). I subsituted the regular Angus with their \"Snake River Farms\" American Wagyu Patty. Overall, I did not like the many different flavors put in this burger, especially the bitterness of the red cabbage.. I think there was way too many things going on at the same time. I did love the richness of the patty and the buns were shiny, soft and super scrumptious!!  I will give this place another try. Next time, I will try the critically acclaimed burger. Plus I will try a plain custom burger just with the patty, lettuce, tomato and amercian cheese (no distractions from other supporting additions).  Service was really good, Pricing was ok I really enjoyed their Very Innovative Menu.",

I arrived around 2:00-2:30 and the host told me it was about a 30 minutes wait.  What I wish she would have told me was the bar is open seating, so people that walked in after me sat down first.  When I was finally sat, they place me in a secondary room by the kitchen which was empty, so I did not understand the long wait time.     The staff was all very nice and polite.  The food was amazing!!!  My wife had The Lonely Bird which she loved.  I had the The \"Banh-Mi\" Burger which was also amazing.  We both shared the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Pork Belly Steamed Buns.  I am from Orange County and the closes to me is in L.A. which is a little too far, but next time I am near another location I am defiantly returning.",

I didn't know what to expect but everything about it was perfect and fantastic. I asked for medium rare- they nailed it. I wanted juicy- I got it. I wanted good- I got fantastic.   I ordered the ronin burger: Ronin Burger, which is Angus Beef, Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, and Yuzu Citrus Aioli (and a sweet Hawaiian style bun). Weird? Maybe. Does it matter? No. It was awesome. Did I say that already?   It's possible that I just nailed the perfect menu item. Seeing other reviews I would guess not really.   We did have the parmesan fries- I could have done without. At least 7 beers listed on the menu were out of stock. That was a bit disappointing. And in terms of atmosphere, it's nothing special. It's great if you're getting a burger but not so much if you're looking for a nice night out. I would definitely come back here regardless of my intentions for the night! ;) And maybe the beer will be re-stocked by then!",

I usually just get the build your own burger and add avocado and cheddar to it and it's so yummy! My boyfriend and I always go here for date nights and it's perfect. We recently tried the oxtail chili cheese fries and they were so good considering I don't like chili cheese fries at all. I also really like the Jasmine milk tea but some days it's on and off. I love the red velvet(not sure if they still have it) and peanut butter chocolate shake! Will always come back(:",

Ordered Oxtail Chili fries which were forgotten and then brought out long after we had finished our burgers.  And these we just - meh.  3.  Bar counter and tables were wiped down with mildew-smelling rag.  4.  Only 2 individual bathrooms, so line is long.    5.  Beer was overpriced.

    "text": "I finally made my triumphant return to Bachi Burger a few weeks ago onky a girls' escape-from-LA weekend.   After this visit, my sister and I have tried almost all of the burgers and will need to move on to the crab, chicken, and fish burgers (and baos).  During this visit we ordered the bahn mi burger and the kalbi burger, both of which were absolutely delicious and craftily done. The kalbi burger was topped with kimchee and tasted like a korean bbq meal in a bun. However, for me, the bahn mi burger really stole the show and may just be my favorite choice so far. Burgers are inherently greasy and meaty and, although this burger accomplishes that \"essence,\" it also managed to be really light and clean on the palate and brought through all of the herbal and fresh flavors of a traditional bahn mi sandwich.   Seriously, the bahn mi is bomb-ass.   The wait was about the same as the last time, but the timing was much better, with everything coming out at about the same time as opposed to the fries coming out first with the burgers following some time after. The service was great as it was the first time- the staff is very attentive and you can really tell they take pride in the menu.   The only sadface from this visit is that I was really intent on trying the homemade poptart only to find that it wasn't on the menu anymore. Maybe next time! *fingers crossed*",

    "text": "On my most recent visit to Las Vegas, I decided to drive off the Strip and try out Bachi Burger. I've seen and heard good things about this Asian fusion style burger joint.   The place, which opened a couple years ago, is rather non-exciting. It's a very open tall space, but I felt like the place could use a better job with its interior decoration. The staff was all friendly and helpful as well.  Now, onto the food. We started with the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, Truffle Parmesan Fries, Chili Fried Chicken, and then our burgers. The fries and chicken were average. The chicken had a nice flavor to it, but it was a bit dry for me. Totally loved the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries along with the fried egg on top. It's a must order.  I split a Ronin Burger and a Miyagi-San's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. The Ronin has some Japanese coleslaw with some Yuzu citrus in it as well as fried egg. I loved it. The Miyagi San was enormous, with its bacon and onion rings in the burger. I preferred the Ronin. I completely loved the Taiwanese buns they used...so soft and tasty. They're made at a local bakery several miles away.   Though these gourmet Asian fusion burgers can be a bit on the pricey side (similar to Umami Burger), they're well worth it. Burgers are 7oz and I was more than full when our meal was done. I wish I had some space for their malasadas for dessert. Their strawberry guava milkshake was quite delish as well. Their Asian-inspired menu also includes a bunch of boba teas.",

We were on the waiting list for 10 minutes being told that there are no tables or bar seats available, but a couple comes in after us and they quickly seat them at a bar. I of course complained and they really didn't do anything special which was upsetting of course. When we finally get a table and order, we waited for 20 minutes for the food to arrive. If they had better service, I'd give them 5 stars because their burgers are beyond wonderful; but I unfortunately can't because of the terrible experience I had.",

I ordered the salt and pepper garlic fries because I love garlic and expected the salt and pepper to add a little kick. Ok...there was no garlic but there was a generous amount of ginger, which I really didn't expect. It was also under seasoned with salt and pepper.   My chili fried chicken was extremely salty. On the salty scale of one to 10, it was at an 8. They were also not as crispy as much as they were soggy and oily.   Overall I was disappointed.

I was introduced to this burger spot when I first moved to vegas and has been my favorite spot every time. I bring all my fam and friends here when they come into town and they loved it!  Favorites: Spicy miso burger with a fried egg is so juicy and delicious!!! Must order their truffle parmesan fries & garlic fries which are so good as well!!  As everyone have mentioned, the wait is crazy but it is so worth the wait. I promise you! Try to get there as soon as they open or else you could be waiting up to an hour and a half to be seated. Go! Go! Go!",

Everything tasted pretty good, but the flavors were quite strong and I didn't love anything so much that I would come back for it (since there are so many great eateries in Vegas)  Ordered: Oxtail Chili Fries - These were good! Salty, it was perfect to share with 3-4 people before the burgers came out Ronin Burger - Good, strong onion flavor Keiki Burger - OK, strong sweet flavor  All-in-all, it was a good dining experience and if I had to go back I'd be interested in trying some of the other burgers. But I'd rather go to Serendipity 3 at Cesars Palace!",

So they bring out the big steak knives and I got all excited.   These things are going to be epic and large.  The size... Ehhh, smaller than I thought.  What a waste of the steak knives.  I ordered the Mr. Ho which comes with the taro buns.  I'm not sure who Mr. Ho is, but someone needs to let him know he needs to put more taro in his buns or else it just falls flat, and seriously, who wants flat buns?  I was expecting some soft buns too especially with the taro in there, major let down. I took two bites of the bun and just decided to eat the patty by itself.  The patty is flavorful but I'm not sure what sauce they have on that thing but it just ruins it.  The Chinese sausage was cut too small and were hard and just fatty.  There was no crunch in that burger at all.   We also ordered the Kiki.  It's so not memorable that I can't even comment on it.  Too much hype and a big let down.  Service was average, parking plentiful.",

Because of the sauces the burgers are pretty rich and different than what most are used to, but that's part of their uniqueness.... Ooot oh, I'm totally drooling thinking of these burgers! Haha!   The bun... I used to think brioche buns were the perfect burger vehicle, but now I'm not as sure! The texture is perfect. I don't know how - but your fillings actually stay in the burger bite after bite. And if you look at the pictures on here you can see that they aren't small burgers by any means!  My only point of contention is that the host also had to be our waiter, server and busser. Don't get me wrong, he did a good job and had a great attitude, but that's a lot of work for one person. After he seated us he said our server would be right over. I heard the server tell him she didn't want any more tables. That's pretty unprofessional! We were only a party of two! Kudos to that host, perhaps he's a supervisor or something?   PS- don't miss the pork belly steamed buns - they were FANTASTIC!  ...I wish this place wasn't 6 hours away from our house!...",

But, I should clarify that this isn't the best burger-tasting burger. It's just an amazing cornucopia of flavors that all seem to come together as one to create a complete sense of food satisfaction.  The Green and Black burger was made with grass fed beef and topped with bacon, blue cheese, mushrooms and spinach I believe. As I said before it was simply awesome. We also shared an order of Parmesan Truffle fries and the pickle appetizer. The pickle sample was really good - only one was hot and the pickled garlic was one of the most interesting on the plate.  Besides food, Bachi Burger makes some really interesting drinks like the strawberry jasmine lemonade I had with my dinner. The atmosphere is quite simple, almost the opposite of the complexity of the burgers. And if I lived in the area I would definitely come back again and again to try everything from the \"Banh-Mi\" Burger to the Crusty Crab.",

Anyway, we left after sitting there from 3:45 to 4:20 without getting seated and went to the Bachi Burger in Summerlin.

The only con I could think of was my burger [the Ronin] and my friend's [Kiki] both tasted very sweet. It was good, but a tad too sweet. I think people who enjoy Bulgogi will like these Asian style burgers. The only reason why I mention this is the burgers here reminded me of bulgogi because of the sweet flavors marinated in the meat.    I liked the squishy bun and how well it held all the ingredients together. Besides the dripping sauce, I loved how it did not fall apart and was easy to eat.   My favorites: Tasted a sip of my friend's apple lychee soda, it was DELICIOUS!!!! I rarely drink soda but I really loved this drink it was so refreshing. I also really enjoyed the garlic truffle fries!!",

I had the Miyagi- sans Wagyu burger which was an amazing mixture of a perfectly cooked beef patty with Furikake bacon and chili mayo. This burger is now my benchmark for all others!   My wife had the Bachi fish burger and loved the grilled cod and special tartar sauce. She normally loads the sauces onto her sandwiches but said that the flavors were so beautifully balanced that she did not want to alter it in any way. I felt the same way about my burger.   Even the buns were fresh and delicious and these are often overlooked.   We also had the truffle / Parmesan fries. They were crisp and delicious and the truffle-Parmesan balance was perfect. Neither dominated the other, and the the porcini cream sauce that accompanied them was wonderful.   We ended our meal with the Portuguese donuts. The freshly fried donuts arrived with coffee gelato, and raspberry sauce that complimented the cinnamon- sugar coated donuts with a wonderful bitter sweet combination of flavors.   Thanks to Dylan and Natalie for a wonderful evening meal with friendly service and conversation!",

We had the Miyagi-Sans burger and it was amazing.  Grass fed, wagyu beef with a fried egg. Yum. The union rings in the burger was a nice touch leaving every bite with a crunchy texture.  We also shared the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and that is a must!   Will come back and hopefully, they will have Ramen available on the menu next time.   Bucket list for sure.",

Quick tip: the ramen place is currently closed, so it *does not* serve ramen at this time.  We were told in November 2018 that maybe January or later 2019, they didn't know for sure.   I suppose I should also mention that the first time we went to this Bachi Burger months ago for ramen, they just said not today with no other explaination, so we left and went to Monta Ramen. (Oh, that's another review I have not done...I am such a slacker.)  This time, we decided to stay.  I went for my usual Banh Mi burger.  I am not a fan of messy foods, but this is tasty and messy.  We also love the fries, the simple ones without any toppings.  They are crispy and salted just enough.  My DH  usually gets the Kobe burger, enjoys the craft beer selection, and can always find something he likes.  I get to drive us home. :-)",

Just thinking of it makes my mouth water. Moderately priced for the fare you are getting, but keep in mind that burgers come \"naked\", all sides are separate. If you're in Las Vegas, venture off the strip and give this place a try. You won't be sad that you did.",

She got the job done but was a little blunt and didn't seem very friendly. I ordered a drink I ended up not liking and she seemed pretty annoyed and gave me a \"well do you want something else\" she definitely wasn't the friendliest server I've had but also not the worst.   I'm not eating red meat so I didn't try a burger which seems to be what they're known for. I went in wanting ramen but she told us they didn't have ramen today.   Wedge salad- it was alright. A lot of lettuce, a little bit of everything else. But still seemed fresh and it's hard to disappoint me with anything that has blue cheese on it so it was good.  The truffle fries- I love fries, especially truffle fries and I didn't care for these. None of it had any flavor and truffle fries should have a lot of flavor. The fries on their own were flavorless and I couldn't even really taste the truffle.   My boyfriend said his burger was good but pretty dry and he's definitely had better burgers. When asked if he was underwhelmed or overwhelmed with it he said underwhelmed.  Nothing terrible to say about this place but probably wouldn't choose to eat here again next time we're in Vegas. Although others in our group love this place we weren't too impressed but it was satisfying enough.",

The oxtail chili cheese fries was definitely shareable for 2-4 people as an appetizer. I'm for one not a big chili cheese fries to start off with but this was on another level. There was a lot of good flavors but my only complaint would be not enough cheese was on the fries.   I had the Miyagi-San burger and loved every single Waygu bite! I have always been to burger joints where the egg is on the runny side which I'm not a big fan of but the egg was perfectly cooked the way I like it. The crunchy fried onions were huge and gave the burger a nice texture in contrast to the soft burger bun.   I would definitely come back here to try other menu items!",

Finally a place that makes a burger with a substantial amount of meat. I started off with the house pickles veggies. I think that was my favorite part of the meal. They were amazing. I can't recommend them enough. A must have if you dine here. Then I had The myagi son burger which was also very good.  Like I mentioned earlier this burger had a perfect size wyagu beef patty that was perfectly proportioned to the size of the burger and the toppings. My side was one of salt and pepper fries that were perfectly seasoned with lime, cilantro, and jalapenos.  So good. . I'm very satisfied and will definitely return.",

A simple \"hello\" or \"we'll be with you\" would have sufficed and is industry standard.

The design here is similar to the other locations, with a dark modern interior that still feels casual.  The menu features, you guessed it, a decision-impairing selection of Asian fusion burgers. The Kiki is my go-to, with a trio of onions, bacon, and gruyere with a sweet marmalade and spicy aioli. I had a minimal amount of mushrooms, which was disappointing considering they're the main reason I get this burger. It was served perfectly med-rare, though.  A friend chose the Bison Burger, with fig jam, onions, bacon, and bleu. This was a touch dry, not just because of the meat but it could have used a sauce. That said, the meat was so good that the leftovers were devoured in record time. A major plus to this burger is that it includes a side of fries, which you can upgrade to the truffle fries- do it, and ask for extra sun dried tomato sauce!  The service has been appropriately attentive but didn't rush us out when I lingered catching up with a friend. Prices are a bit high to make this a regular burger stop, but Bachi isn't putting out \"regular\" burgers anyway.",

But if you aren't a big chili person don't get it. Just get the truffle fries instead.   Their burgers are delicious! I always get the Kiki.   Not impressed with the ramen though.",

    "text": "Definitely a fan!   I absolutely love a hearty bowl of ramen especially after a night of drinking.. With that being said, I woke up Saturday morning from a night full of clubbing/drinking to a monstrous hangover! I woke my boyfriend up and said, \"we need to get ramen RIGHT NOW.\" Thankfully, a group of friends of ours recommended Bachi Burger and I'm soo glad they did! At first I was a little hesitant considering the restaurant is called \"Bachi Burger\" though we were coming for the ramen, but it definitely did not disappoint! For those staying on the strip, this location was roughly 6 miles away and was about a 15 minute drive. We arrived a little after noon and waited about 15 minutes for a table. Dillon, our server, was attentive, polite, and patient - while I indecisively decided on what kind of ramen to order. I decided on the spicy miso ramen based on the numerous yelp pictures/reviews but was a bit nervous due to the amount of spice (sensitive stomach + night of drinking = possible regrets). Safe to say, it was the perfect kick to get me through the day. The spicy miso wasn't too spicy, in fact it was a little sweet. I also asked for softer noodles and they definitely delivered. I was a little disappointed because the ramen had 1 pork belly meat and not as much garnishes as I'm used to :( Aside from that, the meal was great! Perfect spice, generous portions, customizable textured noodles, and oily/rich flavors! I wasn't able to finish the entire bowl and took it to-go. I ate it 2 hours later and it was just as great!! Too bad we don't have a Bachi Burger in California :(",

Had the salt & pepper garlic fries. One order is enough to share for 2 people. They were out of the brussel sprouts, but want to try those next time!",

They got a wide variety of different types of burgers you can order from.  So depending if you like your burgers plain, to having lots of sauce or additional toppings, you can choose how you like them.  The first time I went there I got their Bachi Burger and it was too sweet for me.  The second time I went I got the Banh Mi Burger and that was actually decent.  I got Truffle Parmesan Fries on the side that was good too.  Overall, maybe it's because I like a good ol' fashioned burger, I think this place is just okay.",

I didn't really know what furikake or wagyu beef was but damn...I'm sure those were the main flavors. They gave it an asian fusion twist to it. The patty was so juicy...perfect! It was a bit pricey but I didn't mind that. I would pay that price again. I'm coming back here when I visit Vegas again to try their specialty fries!",

We came to Vegas not knowing where we wanted to have dinner, so I searched on Yelp and I was super surprised to find a place with almost 3000 reviews! The intrigue was too much for me, so we decided let's try this!!   We started with oxtail fries (you need to experience this), garlic chicken wings, and spicy garlic edamame. All three dishes were sooooo good!!! We all got the Vietnamese iced coffee, which unfortunately tasted a bit watered down. It was still good, but didn't pack the punch that I'm used to.  I had the kalbi burger (sooo yummy!!!). The others had the miso burger, manga burger, and black n green burger. Everyone LOVED their burgers. We were completely stuffed,  but we noticed the bread pudding and Portuguese donuts on the menu so we had to try!! Those desserts were amazeballs!!!   Our waitress was excellent. Everything about this place is great. When we walked in and were told it was a 15 min wait, we were kind of excited because it was the first confirmation that this place is legit! I really wish there was a Bachi Burger in my town.  I kind of want to eat here everyday!!",

I sat at the bar with a glass of wine and was leafing through my work while I ate. My waitress was pushing for me to put my food in to-go boxes within 35 mins of me being seated and I had eaten less than half my appetizer and entree. I looked around and saw only half the tables were occupied at 9PM and asked her if they were closing soon- she blushed and said they closed at 11PM. She didn't make me feel comfortable or welcome as a solo diner and I got my check right after and left.  However foodwise-  I ordered the signature Oxtail fries and the Black and Green Burger. Both were solid choices. They both had a great blend of textures and flavors. Sweet, tangy, savory, garlicky, a hint of spice, and some crunch here and there- I would highly recommend both dishes! I appreciated the fact they didn't over-season the fries so it would balance out the intensity of the Oxtail chili flavors and dressed with jalapenos, cilantro, and a garlic Sriracha aioli. The burger also packed an explosion of flavor with the roasted garlic and blue cheese cutting into the savory sauteed mushrooms and beef, using the spinach as a medium to round the flavors out.  The cocktail and wine menu choices were okay, the beer selection was awesome. I wouldn't be able to handle eating here too often but would definitely come back if friends wanted to check the place out.",

The bahnmi was a little bit of a let down especially since I love bahnmi sandwiches and the meat was over cooked. The shogun was cooked well and was tasted yum. Oxtail chili cheese fries were good, not mind blowing like I had hoped. Pork belly bao were a let down as well, very little meat and the steamed buns were almost cold and stiff. Our waitress finally came back and apologized for the long absence due to a large order and took our dessert order. Dessert and our to go order took forever. Overall I wouldn't come back.",

One out of town guest, was not familiar with the menu options and opted for a plain burger with lettuce, onions, ketchup and mustard. The staff was more than ok to do it and our guest loved his burger.  The environment is clean and sleek. It is a popular place, so you may need to wait for a table but it's worth the wait.

The service is fine, the waiters attentive, and I really enjoyed the fries, but there was just something off to me about the flavor of the burgers. Maybe it's just me because the people I go with enjoy the burgers, but it is what it is.  The latest visit was with a friend of mine from out of town and I wanted to take him to a burger joint off the Strip. We ordered edamame as our appetizer and truffle parmesan fries. I ordered a Kiki's Burger (angus beef, sauteed shitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli) and while I finished the burger, I tried really hard to not show on my face that I thought it tasted off. My friend enjoyed his burger just fine which makes me happy, but I did not enjoy mine. I had hoped it would because I love mushrooms! Everything about the burger on paper sounds great. It's just something about the sauce or something that makes me not want to order it again.",

I was disappointed. Not worth the price. In the other hand the ramen was great. Probably the best one ive had in vegas. Still my favorite ramen place is in los angeles....santouka ....unbeaten",

Please see below for the formula and note that you can substitute any variety of beer to achieve said boner, however the other 3 items must be eaten in their entirety.

    "text": "love the banh-mi burger! It was definitively my favorite.  My fiancee and I went here, he loves the typical (plain) American burger and in love a mouthful of flavors. So this is the perfect spot to compromise!   Some may wonder why the burger only comes as itself and not with fries or something on the side, it's because they are HUGE! I can barely finish one, less than with their fries. Their fries are HUGE, definitively something you should share. I love fries, so they had a few flavors to choose from. I usually try the garlic fries or gravy fries. With any actually can't do wrong.  Ambience is nice, wait time can be hot or miss. Either we get seated right-away or we have a log wait ahead of us. No reservations below 10 people, the few times I had called ahead.   Price is mid range, Definitively worth for these 'fusion' mixes of burgers.",

But the burger proved me wrong. I don't remember what it was called, but it was the pork and beef one, with the taro bun. The bun didn't have much taro flavor, but was a gorgeous color. The seasoning and sauce on the burger were sweet but not overly so. With the pork in the patty, I think it went well together.  FYI furikake is a type of seasoning, usually a mix of seaweed, sesame seeds, dried and ground fish/veggies that you put on rice.",

    "text": "This place has been my go to burger joint for over 5 years.  I've seen a lot of change over the years.  Good thing is the food tastes the same for the most part (truffle fries have tasted different) but you never know what kind of service you're gonna get. My last 3 visits the service has been slow service will be and no one even tries to come around to apologize for the wait or fills your water as it gets low.  So I can say in the past I spent a lot more here but every time I come back another fave was taken off the menu (katstushiro an alcoholic beverage and the bread pudding with coffee ice cream, boba tea drinks as well) so I just order my faves that remain which is the miyagi San, which is delicious by the way.  I do recommend it and is why we come so often.  We also get the oxtail fries, it's a must.  Anyways back to the last visit, the host sat us before people that were there before us and they got so mad that they left before we could even tell the host.  Then once w e got our order in the food took awhile but not only that, when it did come it was just our burgers.  By the time the fries came my husband was done with his burger and the rest of us waited for the fries so the burger was cold by then.  She was nice enough to comp the fries since they came so late which I  appreciate and I'll sure was not her fault but was not cool to have brought friends to the first time to experience this.  They may or may not ever want to go back on their own.  They did enjoy the burger though so they may try it again.  My point I'm trying to make is they need to tighten up on the service.  Not sure what's happening with management but there is new faces every time we come so we never get treated like regulars even though were always here.  Our visits are becoming less because of this.",

Second visit we just came for takeout, and were ignored for the first 10 mins. We waited to put in our order, then finally after asking the host, a server came by to take it. We waited at the bar for easily 15 minutes before the bartender noticed us and asked us if we wanted any water. The place wasn't crowded at all, a few empty tables in fact. We were the only take out customers. We waited a total 30-40 mins for the food to finally be ready, and it was cold and soggy. The burgers were ok, (asked for medium rare, it was medium-well). Overall not a great experience. This review refers mainly to the customer service aspect, the food was decent earning a 2 star rating instead of 1.",

    "text": "A lot of friends have been asking me about my experience at one of the newest spots to grub in LV, so I thought I'd break it down for you J to the Y style...   Location: It's about 7 miles off the strip. If you don't have your own set of wheels and want to split between 4 in a cab it shouldn't be too bad. I'd say maybe $30? Though, that is just one way...   Wait: Came here on Wednesday night around 8pm. Not packed at all and seated immediately.   Bathrooms: Always a line.   Patrons: A lot of Asians. Go Figures.   Parking: Plenty  Service: Not bad. Our waiter seemed a bit flustered at times and would often repeat itself but I'd chalk it up to a long day.   Food:  1. Ox-Tail Chili cheese fries: Not impressed. Don't let the fancy name fool you. It was just ok and rather forgettable. Also, not a big fan of the cilantro they sprinkle on top.   2. Ronin Burger: Contrary to what other people's Yelp Check-in suggestions may state you might want to re-think about your own taste buds for a second. Had two friends order this burger cause it was \"Highly suggested\" from the other yelpers they saw who ate there previously and they were both a bit let down. Big surprise...   3. Kiki Burger: I ordered the Kiki burger and I actually really enjoyed it. I had a bite of the Ronin and it just didn't have the same kick as the Kiki...   *If you don't want to splurge for their $22 Shogun Foie gras burger, do yourself a favor and get the Kiki burger. It's bomb.   *The burgers are decent size for the price as well. Slightly bigger than an Umami burger and on par with one from 38 Degrees.   *Jessica Y. and I are both concur that this Burger is great for the area but it isn't something new...Especially if you frequent gastropubs and eat burgers from 38 degrees, Umami, and Slaters.   *Never fear Californians, my inside sources tell me that they will be in fact opening two new locations in the So Cal area in 2014. One will be on Sawtelle and the other in some place in Santa Monica...   ** Bachi Burger in Vegas is  definitely worth checking out once if you're in the area and if you're sick and tired of eating at buffets and if you don't feel like waiting 1 hr 1/2 for pan roast. However, it isn't ambrosia. Manage your expectations and you'll have a great and memorable experience.   Cheers,   Justin \"Kiki\" Y.   Shoutouts to J to the Y. and the homie Young Rich",

The miyagi san burger is to die for. Literally speaking you would probly die over time if you ate it everyday considering the mouth water sauce, soft bread, onion rings, bacon, and an egg cooked to perfection. As if that isn't enough, be sure to stuff the truffle fries down your throat as well. This place is must!",

The service was slow and inattentive. We told the waiter that we didn't want anything with heat. However, we ordered garlic fries and didn't notice that it had jalapeno until it got to the table. I would expect the waiter to at least check that we knew it had jalapeno after we were so adamant that we did not want anything hot. Nope. Took our order and disappeared.

I ordered the Miyagi-San burger which was insanely good. The fresh buns are the softest I have ever held and my burger was cooked just how I wanted it.

    "text": "Definitely one of my favorite burger bars in Las Vegas.  My goal is to go down the menu list and try each one of their burgers. So far, I have accomplished 4.   Ronin burger: This was my very first burger at Bachi. It is made up of angus beef, caramelized onions, fried egg, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, katsu BBQ, and yuzu citrus aioli. So simple, but so good.  Shogun burger: The burger consisted of waygu beef & unagi, pan seared foie gras, poached asian pear, miso butter, and yamamomo peach. There were so many flavors going on in my mouth, it's hard to describe the taste. Is it worth $25? Probably not. Is it worth a try? Definitely yes.  Miyagi-san burger: Another waygu beef burger. Also comes with fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, onion rings, and chili mayo. Great tasting burger. I liked how it was not messy, even though it had so much going on in it.  Kiki's burger: The most recent burger I tried. This is Bachi's version of a mushroom burger. It's made of angus beef, sauteed shiitake, enoki, and eryngii mushrroms. There's also caramelized bacon and gruyere cheese. Sauce: garlic chili aioli and sweet onion marmalade. I like it.   If you're feeling extra fatty, get the oxtail chili cheese fries. Pretty heavy. But SO good and savory. Get it to share!  They also serve ramen here at Bachi. I've tried one of their bowls before but it was not memorable. I don't even remember the name of it. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Just stick with the burgers.  p.s. Bachi is better than Umami",

Next, the burgers are a pleasant mix of barbecue flavor and tender juicy beef patty. Not only are they super delicious but they are also very decent sized. They do come a la carte so I ordered a side of edamame and can I just tell you how satisfying it was to order and enjoy a great plate of edamame at a burger joint?  So much yes.",

We came around 6:30pm on Saturday and we didn't have to wait.  It is a little difficult to find because the sign blends into the building.    The service was great and place was clean.  The food was awesome, quite possibly one of the best burgers I have had.  I recommend the Spicy Miso burger.  The Oxtail Tail fries were awesome.  Who knew that a fried egg on top of the fries would be oh so good.    Loved this place!  I hope they open a branch in LA one day!",

    "text": "I want to like this location (Windmill). When they opened, I was a regular (one mile from the house); and then the prices went up, the service dropped and it was always crowded. (A good thing for them)   However, the last two times I have returned have been dismal. On my most recent visit, I felt that the objective wasn't on service but on ignoring the empty glasses on the table, the waves by the wife of my friend. (I was hosting another couple) And my table didn't want to order water, we wanted to order (Profitable) beverages.   I finally rose from the table, found our waiter and asked, Has the policy changed? You don't serve second drinks to customers? His response, \"Absolutely\" Which didn't make a lot of sense, but by that time, we were, in a word, done and not only had we been waiting for second drinks, but we were trying to get someone's attention to pay the bill. Is it me, or should our waiter want to be paid? Our entire party was dismayed by the service, or lack of.  Okay, the service was ... in a word..a failure, so move onto the food. Not to the caliber of the early days, when Bachi seemed excited to deliver a new and exciting product. The foods seems to have been value engineered to the degree that they are counting on tourists to support the revenue goals, i.e. Eat and never come back.   My friend summed it up in one question, \"Why did you want us to come here?",

    "text": "Mmmmmmmm mmmm...after waiting an entire year to eat this (bf tried it the year before and raved about it, and our next trip wasn't for another year!), it was very much worth the wait. Since we knew we probably wouldn't be back for another year, we went all out -- oxtail chili cheese fries and pork belly buns to share, and I went for the shogun burger since it has foie gras and it's banned in California.  Oxtail chili cheese fries were my fave of the meal - the perfect bite had a little bit of everything, plus a jalapeno to add some more spice. I would definitely get this every time - and I hope they have it on the CA menu when it opens!  Pork belly buns were good, but not the best I've had. Still really good though, and worth trying if you like 'em. A little oily, and you can't really taste the hard-boiled egg, but still yummy with the soft bao.  Now for the $26 shogun burger -- it came with a beef patty, unagi, and foie gras. That's a LOT of meat, and the menu actually shows it \"deconstructed\" and I ended up eating it kind of this way too, just because there was so much stuff going on. I liked the patty & foie gras together, and the roasted/grilled pear was a very nice complement to the heavier flavors. It's definitely a rich and filling burger though; I could barely eat half of it. So if you get this, you probably don't need anything else - or you should share it with someone else, along with apps. I wouldn't get it again, just because I can't finish it and it's expensive, but I'm very happy I got to try it and get some foie gras!  And just 'cause they were so good, I have to mention it again -- it's only a day later, and I'm already dreaming of those fries...",

They were delicious, and would probably rank 3rd on my all-time list of garbage plate fries. The one thing that hold them back are that the fries themselves are really simple, but this is pretty typical of chili cheese fries. The waiter said we wouldn't be able to finish a whole order of fries and our burgers...how wrong he was. We frickin destroyed our entrees!

Service was great- our waiter was funny, attentive and CRAZY fast.  We shared a few plates including the shishito peppers, octopus balls (not the best but not bad), onion rings ( AMAZING, we should have ordered 4 orders instead of 1) and we each got a noodle bowl or a burger for our mains.  Broth was delish of my noodles and the noodles were good, but the chewier ramen from the dish with the XO sauce had better texture.  Pork belly pieces were like bits of porky heaven- honestly it was very memorable and delicious.  Cannot stress enough how good the onion rings were.  As a bit of a onion ring connoisseur I have to say they rank at the top of my lifetime list, and they were incredible inexpensive.  MUST GO BACK!  You need to go and try this place out, now :)",

    "text": "Bachi Burger is a little drive from the strip, head towards Henderson. It's not too far but if you don't have a car or don't like to drive out of Vegas, then you're potentially missing out on an awesome meal. Even though this restaurant is away from all the city lights and sounds, it's still pretty well known as it should be. It seemed like a good amount of their customers were locals. Random out of towners like us would pop up probably either by word of mouth or Yelp of course. We arrived around 1-2 pm and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. The interior is clean, nothing fancy, simple designs and decorations, but the food is another story.  Service was quite on point. Our waitress was cheery but not overly fake-friendly. She returned numerous of times to check up on us and to make sure our drinks never dipped below half way. Even the manager(s) swung by to ask how everything was. All that was missing was for the chef to come out and greet us which I didn't expect would happen anyways.   Bachi Burger seems like they're a mix combination of Japanese and Korean entwined with a fusion/gourmet twist. I saw both cultures' ingredients on the menu. To start we ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - with garlic aioli and a fried egg ($11.50). If you haven't figured it out by now, we Asians love to put a fried egg on everything: rice, noodles, burgers, and apparently now chili cheese fries. Forget house fries; order yourself one of these bad boys. You can easily share it between four people but if you're like the Craig R. who orders EIGHT items for two people, then this may not be sufficient. Check what he ordered in his review. The colossal mix was addicting and the skinny fries are a perfect blend. Then again, I'm biased against fat fries. When the server attempted to take the dish away to make room for our main entrees, I caught myself snarling at her because I wanted to eat the remaining four pieces.   I was seriously stuck in between two places when it came to ordering my burger. Either Kiki's Burger ($9.5) - Angus beef, sauteed shiitake, enoki & eryngi mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli (doesn't it all sound heavenly) or the Kalbi Burger ($9) - Angus beef, kalbi marinade, green onions, house made kimchi, ko chu jang mayo. The Kalbi Burger won this time, only because Gooch who recommended this place to me told me to try it. Although I have full confidence in the Kiki's Burger, my Kalbi Burger was instant gratification. The mixed blend of Angus and kalbi sauce with the kimchi made me feel like I was eating at a Korean BBQ joint. To knock it out of the park for a grand slam, they should've or maybe I should've asked for them to throw a fried egg in it even though that might have be a little over kill. You can't go wrong with this burger. However, if I was to return I'd like to try Kiki's Burger to compare the two.  I got to sample the Spicy Miso Burger and all I have to say about that is that it's not spicy at all. Also, my Kalbi Burger already had the knock out 1-2 punch so it would be unfair to say that this miso burger was mediocre. At that point, I was already mesmerized with my order.  If you have a car or willing to travel a little out of the Strip, then venture off to Bachi Burger for an appetizing meal. They do close late on the weekends: 2 am, so you have plenty of time to plan your visit. The prices are reasonable, the food is sick (& great presentation), and the service is superb.  Good looking out Gooch Y. for recommending this spot!",

It was on the food network and it's off the strip so no one really wanted to take a cab just to eat a burger with me. Luckily on my last day here I found someone who was willing to try it with me. There was a bit of a wait, but it wasn't too bad. We shared the oxtail chili fries and split the Ronin and Banh Mi Burger. Both of them were delicious! I liked how mine came with fish sauce and the patty had beef, pork, shrimp mixed in the patty. Definitely worth the trip so make sure you come here and try it!",

The plate was enough for a few to share. As for the main course, I had a regular hamburger, added avocado and fried egg. It was a tasty treat and I was not disappointed.   The atmosphere seemed to cater more towards a younger crowd. They play pop music, have decent staff and not much to complain about. The prices are mid level but food quality is in line with prices. Would definitely try again",

Most of my experience comes from the San Francisco Bay Area, and I've tried dozens of places, if not hundreds, from cheap burger joints to upscale restaurants. Like Umami Burger, Roam Artisan Burgers, 4505 Meats, Mission Beach Cafe, SuperDuper, Chow, Marlowe, or even Spruce... Some of them were fantastic, but Bachi goes even further. My wife agrees.  I don't know what makes us addicted to their burgers, but I'm pretty sure they put some kind of cocaine in the ingredients. We need to blow a whistle to invite DEA to stop this madness. But before doing that, please allow me to have one last bite of the Miyagi-san burger... or the Kiki burger... or the Ronin burger... or the Just Fries... oh please help me!",

Really enjoyed the food and the service was good. Tried the Spicy Miso burger, along with the Parmesian and Sweet Potato fries, and really enjoyed how flavorful the food was. (If you want it spicier, just ask for some sliced peppers.) Reminded me of bibimbap in the form of a burger. Everyone in our party was happy, esp my husband b/c they served Arrogant Bastard.

To go with it I ordered the truffle fries, haven't had truffle fries before so I can't really give a good comparison, but these were delicious.  The Vietnamese Coffee I ordered was a bit light. Too much milk, and they didn't use the normal condensed milk. That's really the only bad thing I could think of with this meal.

Asian infused burgers isn't something many places have tried making, but they should, because it's delicious!  They're located a few minutes from the south strip outlets. The place is clean and very modern looking. They were busy for the lunch crowd but not hectic at all.  Pork Belly Steamed Buns - Open style steam bun loaded with flavor! Thick slice of pork bun that melts in your mouth.  Salt and Garlic French Fries - I go crazy over garlic fries. The fries were skinny cut and were the perfect size.  Mr Ho's Burger - Featuring Angus Beef , Pork, Green Onion, Cilantro Ginger, Garlic Hoisin Mayo, Chinese Sausage, Sauteed Mushrooms, Mizuna, all inside a Taro Bun. This burger is like a Chinese pork bun burger. I love the Chinese sausage which was implemented in the beef patty. The garlic hoisin mayo was sweet and tangy, and the taro bun balanced out the flavors of the meat.http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MGMXM26c3CIDRHT_NsaeSQ/l.jpg  All in all, everyone in our group loved the burgers here.

    "text": "My first visit! Went here with 3 other friends after work one night. The restaurant was full and we waited about 20 min to be seated. The reason why I'm giving 3 stars is because the service was lacking. I don't know if it was an off night but the service we received could be improved. No one came to our table to even take drink orders for a good 15-20 min. When we did get someone and started ordering, they were out of a lot of food items. Thankfully they weren't out of the burgers we wanted...how ironic would that be? It took a while for our food to arrive as well. I want to say a good 35-40 min. I don't know if that's the average wait time for food at this place but that seems quite long to me. However, I do have to say the burgers and fries were delicious. I got the miyaki-san burger and truffle fries. I tried my friend's garlic and pepper fries and those were good too. While I'm not in a huge hurry to come back to this location, if I were in a mood for their burgers, I would try the one closer to where I live and hopefully that location has better service.",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to coming here since I made plans to go to Las Vegas a couple of months ago. Since I've been waiting for so long, my expectation has been building up so high. When I get to the restaurant it's anti-climactic. Not today, Not here.   You can smell the burgers from the parking lot. If the smell is half what it taste like, I was going to be happy. It was and more.   We got here at 3pm on A Thursday, only a few customers were present. We got seated immediately.   Here's the rundown: Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage - delicious, almost like a JapaDog but skinnier and smaller. It was served with some whole grain honey mustard, perfect pairing. Yum!!  Pork Belly Steamed Buns - OMG Delicious. You get 3 per order. The steamed bun was airy. The pork belly was melt in your mouth goodness. Hoisin sauce made for a perfect little bite. My only quibble would be the boiled egg, which didn't add anything to the dish. A sunny side up quail egg would have been just over the top good on this, but that's just my take on it. It's still a very very good dish.   Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - another winner. A huge portion of perfectly cooked fries (crunchy outside, soft inside) topped with Garlic Aioli, Stewed Oxtail and a Fried Egg. The oxtail by itself was so good, but adding everything else was just superb. Must order for sure.   Shogun Burger - talk about a decadent burger. The burger is made with Wagyu Beef topped with Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach & Arugula. It was salty, sweet, bitter, peppery, savory deliciousness. Is this what they call \"Umami\" if not I have a word for it \"Delicious!!\" It's got a hefty price tag, but well worth it.   My son had the Grilled Cheese w/ Fries, Carrots and Apple. It was served with a Bearnaise sauce on the side. My son is a picky eater, but he devoured that grilled cheese. The adults devoured that bearnaise sauce, oh so good. Anything with that sauce would be good.   Usually reality out performs our expectations, not in this case. Reality out performed my expectations and it was high to begin with. Incredible meal.   5 Star Plus I'll definitely be back.",

Maybe if this place weren't so over-hyped and crawling with other foodies lining up outside, I would've lowered my expectations just a tad.    We ordered the Miyagi and spicy miso burgers with garlic fries.  Both were decent burgers flavor wise. But neither were juicy nor truly satisfying.  The fries were warm, well seasoned, but not crispy.  For the prices, I felt a little ripped off.    Service was pretty good. Food came out in a decent amount of time though it did seem like some other tables were dragging.    Overall decent and if in the area again,  I might give it another try.",

I'm not even a burger person, and I ordered the mushroom burger both times. My mouth waters just thinking about it. The sweet potato fries and truffle parm fries will also get your mouth watering.   First time I visited the service was spectacular. The second time, it took 20 minutes for the server to welcome us and take our drink order... from there it got worse and worse. The waitress got our order wrong, then never checked on us (I needed a side of ranch!) and the icing on top was that she billed us for another table's food PLUS ours. It was frustrating.   3 stars for this joint. Know you'll get good food, but only a 50/50 chance of getting good service.",

Don't forget to order some oxtail fries!  Another winner!  I've also had their garlic shrimp special...this is as close as you can get to Giovanni's shrimp truck on the north shore of Oahu.  Yes I'm from Hawaii, I know what I'm talking about.    Overall, great place to get your burger fix.  Next time I need to try their shakes, heard those were delicious.",

    "text": "Bachi is short for Hibachi - Japanese type of grill. Bachi itself means karma.  Ordered: - Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11 - Kalbi Burger $11 - Miyagi-San's Burger $15  Tina's Treasures and Tribulations - We arrived about 10 minutes after they opened and the place was pretty packed with people waiting and tables full - Only waited a good 6-7 minutes to be seated - This place is definitely an Asian fusion of foods and burgers - So of course my friend and I yelped this place before we ordered to see what was the MUST order items - The oxtail chili cheese fries were good, but a con would be that it has to be eaten right away or the fries get super soggy. It was really good and I'm not even into beans as much as a normal person would love it. Garlic aioli sauce was on point! - The Kalbi burger was taste and different with the kimchi and ko chu jang mayo that was in it. The angus beef was on point so freaking good. For the price, I would say it's worth it.  - We went to Shake Shack the day before and I don't think they compare at all. This place definitely takes the lead for creativity - The Miyagi-San's wagyu burger wasn't as great as the kalbi. I think the wagyu beef seemed a little undercooked, but we did ask for it to be medium rare - it fell apart as soon as we cut it in half. It wasn't melt in your mouth good. It was flavorful and juicy & the onion rings gave it a crunch that I loved. That egg though! - Friend and I decided to order two burgers and share that. Obviously, we are like two little girls who cannot eat as much as a guy can so there were left overs. If you're hungry, I suggest get your own, but I think if you get fries and one burger - you can become full or content - We ended up putting the bread/burger buns aside and ate the meat :) - Will have to come back to try the other options!",

Anyways, the host comes out lets people know there is open sitting at the bar and we immediately go in.  The hosts disappears, so we ask the manager if we could sit at the bar cause it was open sitting (just to make sure), but he tells us to wait and he'll ask the host.  We wait, until two gentlemen behind us, just walk and take those two seats at the bar. WTF? Kind of pissed off, the host eventually comes and we tell her our story and she says there is nothing she can do (-____-).  Keep in mind the MANAGER probably forgot to ask the host, cause she didn't even have a clue.  We get the manager and he eventually finds us a seat at the bar.....  Anyways. The FOOD:  Miyagi Sans Grass fed Wagyu Burger  - Furikake, onion rings, caramelized bacon, fried egg and chili mayo. Pretty good, but not the best burger though. We asked for a medium, but the burger was almost well done...  Ronin Burger - Caramelized onions, cole slaw, a fried egg, with some type of aoili on the side. This burger was ok. Not what I expected. The caramelized onions were a little too sweet and there were tons of it on the burger.  Oxtail chili cheese fries - The chili was a bit on the sweeter side, not your typical \"chili\", but it was different.  This was very filling, try to split with someone.   Maybe next time I'll try the pork buns, since I heard it was good... but who knows.",

The spicy edamame starter was a hit.  They were super flavorful and plentiful, but it took a while for it to come out.  5 minutes into eating them, our entrees came out.  The chicken wings were a bit off for me.  They were crunchy, but kinda warm in the middle; not piping hot like fresh chicken.  And a bit on the dry side...  The ramen? I made the biggest mistake by getting their ramen because I almost always instantly regret not getting the burger.  The ramen is good here, but it's super f'ing greasy!  Which is strange because their fries and burgers aren't as greasy as their ramen...?  Service is a hit or miss - depending on what time you come in... I've seen people walk out due to service.

They have an extensive menu with lots of options but I recommend sticking to a burger and fries (or some pork belly buns for those of you who don't like burgers!). We did NOT like the oxtail chili-cheese fries or the Bachi Caesar salad we ordered. My suggestion is stick to the regular fries without all that gamey meat and what not added on top!!! & do NOT order a salad LOL I give you permission to be a fattie for this entire meal, it was one of the worst caesar salads I've had and we ended up only taking a few bites and then throwing the rest away.   My favorite burger out of the three I tried was the RONIN burger!! Caramelized onions, cole slaw, a fried egg, and all of these delicious sauces... What's not to love?!?! The Shogun burger has a lot of hype because of the foie gras in it but none of the boys liked it. I thought it was tasty, BUT very sweet! due to all the fruit in it and perhaps more suited towards a girl's taste palate. However, there were a lot of different flavors and it could get a little overwhelming if you had to eat the entire thing.  The miyagi-san's grass-fed wagyu burger tasted just like a good ol' fashioned BBQ burger if that's what you like but I felt that it was something I could get at a lot of other restaurants and a little plain for me especially after trying all of the other burgers bursting with flavors.  If you live in the area and like burgers, you should definitely check this place out. We had a good dinner but I don't know if I'd particularly recommend going out of your way if you're only visiting for the weekend and taking the drive off the strip to eat one of these burgers.",

However, the fries were a disappointment - they didn't taste very special and we wished that we had ordered something else instead.   Service wasn't too great either; our server greeted and took the orders of the table next to us even though we had been seated before them, and we had been waiting for a little bit waiting for someone to take our orders. Their food also came out before ours, even though in the end we managed to place our orders before them as they needed more time to decide on their orders.",

    "text": "The food quality and taste is 5 stars, but service is slow and everything comes out at different times which makes eating together very challenging. Half the party ordered burgers, they both came out separately and well before the two bowls of ramen.  The gyoza appetizers came out last!!  Gyoza is also covered in chili oil with dabs of chili paste which doesn't go well with kids.  We were afraid to send it back, fearing how long it would take to get plain gyoza so we tried to wipe it all off with napkins.   We also ordered the oxtail covered fries, which were delicious.  The oxtail is more like chili so don't conjure images of the oxtail soup you get at the Cal.    We tried to order a shake, but their machine was broken.  The waitress said they could try to see if \"the other side\" had ice cream to make it with.  At the end of the meal, the waitress asked us if we still wanted the shake as she obviously forgot she never game back to tell us if they found the ice cream.     They really should think about remodeling and making one kitchen so they can time the meals better and probably get more seating to cut down the wait time!    Employees don't seem very happy to be serving you as they're stressed and overworked with the types of crowds you see every day of the week.",

Another different employee yelled & cussed at a busser for getting in her way.

In my perspective, this type of action is very unprofessional and it definitely gives the place a very bad and uncomfortable vibe.  Before even being seated, my sister and I heard 2 servers going at it and cussing at each other, to the point where we heard every single word they were saying to each other.  After 20 minutes into eating our meals, a different employee who was carrying 2 packs of beer, made a scene and yelled at their hostess/busboy who did not move out of her way in time, and said \"FUCKING MOVE NEXT TIME WOULD YA\".  This was not even a foot away from where my family and I were eating.  PLUS next to us we're a family of 3 with a young child, who also heard her as well. Overall, the food is okay but the atmosphere and personalities of majority of the employees here is disgusting. I honestly could not even finish my new because 1.) too much yelling and arguing was happening and 2.) I was just uncomfortable with the vibe in the restaurant. Not going here again and hope they improve the way they speak to their coworkers....",

Decor The interior is hip and modern. Women's bathroom was broken ...not that I go there regularly or anything. Their website sucks. It doesn't have the prices and I don't really care about their origin story.  Service The ramen and burger are cooked in separate kitchens so they might come out a different times.

    "text": "Vegan and Gluten Free review:  I had a salad. It was the only thing on the menu I could eat. I'm totally fine with eating salads, so that is not the reason for the 2 star review. The 2 stars is for the bad service and bleh salad.   I had the kale salad with the candied pecans on the side. I asked if the pecans were candied in butter or if they had any dairy/eggs/etc and the waitress gave me a blank stare and responded quite rudely, \"I don't know. We buy them in packages\". I asked if there was an ingredient label I could read and she was all, \"No\". Awkward. I ordered the pecans on the side because someone at my table wanted them for her kale salad (same salad). When my salad arrived, the waitress placed the plate on the table and said, \"We ran out of pecans.\" The way she said it was just so crass and she had a 'too bad' kind of attitude. Whatever. I looked at my salad and it was literally missing more than half the things that it should have had. It was leaves with dressing on a plate. Who thought this looked good before sending it out?! I got the attention of the waitress and asked her about the missing cranberries and avocado. She was like, \"oh there aren't any cranberries?\" Well, that's what I just said, isn't it? At this point, I was totally over dealing with people. When she returned with the missing toppings, she gave a random (and poor) excuse. That was the end of my interaction with her.  Salad review: I didn't like the dressing because I thought it was way too acidic and there was way too much of it. There was no real balance of flavors in this salad and the toppings did not go well together.   Overall: If you're vegan and your friends really want to eat here, then go for it, but don't say I didn't warn you. If they're up for any burger joint, check out Yardhouse. They have mad awesome service and a great vegan section on their menu (VEGAN BURGER!!!)",

    "text": "I use to live a few blocks from here and when it came to burgers, I had choices from the strip, In-N-Out, and Steiner's.  I wasn't aware of Yelp at the time, so I took the advice from a friend to eat at Bachi and became a fan ever since.  One thing about Bachi is the presentation.  Bachi goes out of the way to make a burger look so beautiful.  I have to admit that I've been here 5+ times and the Sahara location 10+ times in the last 2 years and have yet to try any of their actual burgers. I know, what's wrong with me right?  I guess it's because I love their Bachi Fish (Alaskan Cod), the Lonely Bird (Chicken/Turkey), the Oxtail Fries, and their Bachi Dog.  All are good, very rich due to their sauces, flavorful, and a little messy.  Out of everything I've tried here, their Bachi Fish has to be my favorite.  Couple of side notes about Bachi in general.  Sometimes there's a wait to get your order and served.  Because of this, I rarely hit up Bachi on a weekend.  The Sahara location is bigger and faster in my opinion.  Also, the burgers are little pricey (most over $10).   Overall, I am still giving Bachi 5 Stars even though I have not tried any of their actual burgers.  Based on the other reviews, they're good so don't let my review discourage you from trying them. However, allow my review to encourage you to try the Bachi Fish.  Both restaurants are clean, service always great, and I have never been disappointed with a Bachi visit.",

This place is actually just down the street to the resort we normally stay at, and it is now a must stop for when we come back to Vegas.  We arrived for lunch and was seated promptly. We ordered the oxtail chilli cheese fries and organic edamame for our appetizers. The oxtail chilli cheese fries were crazy good. It had the perfect amount of spiciness and toppings. The wife kept raving about how good the edamame was. If you like garlic then definitely give these a try. They have a very different take on burgers, and from what we tried you can't  go wrong with your selection.  I went with the Miyagi-San burger and it was one of the tastiest I've ever had.  Wagyu beef cooked to perfection. My brother tried Mr Ho's burger and he said it was good.  Tried a bite and he was indeed telling the truth. Wife had the kale salad and she loved every bite of it.  Our server was great.  Actually every worker we came across was great.  So yeah,  the service and staff was awesome.  Everyone was friendly, and our waitress was attentive to our needs.  I definitely recommend this spot, you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Came in around midnight and waited about 10 minutes for a table. Service was great--attentive and enthusiastic. The food, however, did not live up to the hype.   Truffle fries were nice and crunchy, but I wasn't a fan of the black truffle cream. The dipping sauce on the side, however, was bomb. I even smothered it on my burger.  Tried a bite of our friend's oxtail chili cheese fries, and while it was good, it still just taste like chili cheese fries--nothing special.  I ordered the Ronin burger, which was pretty good at first, but the over-medium egg added a strange dry texture to the burger. The accompanying sauce didn't do anything for the burger either, which is why I added the sauce from our fries. Overall, the burger was alright, but the meat is where my issue is. The whole patty was oddly shaped like a perfectly formed puck (smooth, even edges and everything), and while I ordered mine medium rare, I've NEVER had a burger cooked to that degree and NOT be able to fall apart when I stick my fork through the middle of it. I tried to get the meat to crumble by wiggling my fork back and forth, but it just wouldn't... which greatly alarms me. The meat was so packed together it wouldn't even disentangle itself even though it wasn't even cooked through. Strange..  I also ordered an iced green tea to go along with my meals and it was alright too. Sure, you get unlimited refills, but my second glass tasted really diluted to me. At $4, I'd just stick with the free water.  Boyfriend ordered the Miyagi-san and said his burger was good but wasn't that great either. He didn't seem too impressed with the wagyu patty. Our other friends ordered the same 2 burgers and our general consensus was that the burgers were alright but we've definitely had much, much better.   For the price of our meals, we all felt that the quality and flavor wouldn't warrant a return visit. Glad we got to give it a try though, and that it was open late & happened to be on our way up to the strip.",

The food was delicious and I HIGHLY recommend the Shogun burger ($26), though it's a bit pricey, it was worth it! I don't recommend the Taro bun unless you have a sweet tooth, I personally didn't like how the sweet bun countered the spicy miso sauce but overall the burger was tasty. The oxtail fries were SO delicious-- you won't regret!!!!",

    "text": "Once upon a time in Vegas a friend mentioned that we absolutely needed to stop by this burger joint, cool enough. I'm thinking premium beef burgers just on another echelon, but when I learned that we were talking Asian fusion burgers, that blew my mind out of the waters! First he enticed me with some talk of a banh mi burger and oxtail fries. I didn't need to hear much after, I was already sold and we were off to that bad boy!   We first walked in to a pretty chill atmosphere, the place seemed pretty decently sized but small enough to have an intimate vibe. Our group consisted of 15 people and almost right off the bat they were able to accommodate for us, stunning. We were greeted by two young ladies that seemed very comfortable with the size and chaos of our wild group, though these guys were my friends, I would never want to serve us as a whole... These ladies put it down quite effortlessly after all the belligerent yelling of orders and the confusion settled into starving quietness. Anxiously waiting we tried to keep everything as civil as we could but after a few drinks  you already know that's not happening. Through the dining experience the service only got better with a few jokes cracked as to keep the whole experience light hearted and enjoyable. And that it was.. A+ on service!  Now onto the good stuff, the cool of side of the table ;) decided to do a little family style dining as to experience all that bachi burger had to offer. We grabbed 4 shareable plates right off the tee..  The pork belly buns - they were your classic glazed melt in your mouth slab of 3 layered belly paired with a radish, egg and some greens. Sweet, salty and savory harmony of flavors you expect to find in a good belly bun! 8/10  The Peking duck buns - when you go out looking for Peking duck, you're expecting damn crispy skin and hiding under that, tender, juicy duck meat waiting to be chomped down adding in the sweetness of hoisin against that savory succulent bird. Everything was there, don't be afraid of the duck! 8/10  Oxtail fries - simply amazing, crispy fries layered with sweet, spicy, and savory oxtail chili. Hold on, it doesn't end there. When you pair these bad ass ingredients with a fried egg, you simply shot me in the head leaving me dead amongst those who have died in peace... Seriously, the unctuous egg yolk leaves the richest taste in your mouth screaming out as if you wanted the chef to throw in another egg. TO. DIE. FOR. We ordered two, so shall you. 9/10   Takoyaki - the Takoyaki was okay... Maybe everything else was entirely way too good that I felt like this one fell short, 6/10  Last up the \"shogun burger!\" It's seriously nothing short of epic! The burger is laced with wagyu beef,  unagi, foie gras, poached Asian pear, miso butter and pear. The first salty bite is complimented the sweetness of the fruit cutting against the richness of all the ingredients. The beef seems to be glazed with something cause it's packing a ton of flavor. All of the ingredients work together harmoniously to make this 26 dollar burger a Big Bang. If you're out for something extravagant, look no further 9/10  Overall I'd say this place is a hit, excellent service, good atmosphere and a few things in the menu for adventurous eaters. I bet all the money in the world you're about done with every plain Jane burger joint you've ever been to, just don't come looking for me if you don't like the joint ;) Put down what you're doing and get over to Bachi Burger. It's worth it!",

    "text": "I was definitely using the force on this day. (May 4th) I found this place on the Triple D app on my Iphone. It happened to be close to the office I was visiting in Vegas on a business trip. Let's just say the food is everything Guy described on the show.   Got there around 1:15pm on Monday and the place was packed. Its located in a strip mall sort of but appears to be the main attraction. I waited only 5 minutes before being seated. Let me stress that the place remained full the entire time I was there. If someone got up, someone was sat. The waitstaff is super cool and laid-back but efficient in serving these morsels of goodness. I always judge a place on capacity and fullness, this place is off the chart.   I can't speak for anything but what I ordered. That being said, its the only thing I would get again not to diminish my view of the establishment. I had the Miyagi-sun burger and salt/pepper fries. First, the burger has all the highlights of sports center on a Sunday night during football season. It comes with Chili Mayo  Fried Egg  Furikake Caramelized Bacon  Crispy Onion Rings - its like a symphony in your mouth. The beef is like butter with texture in your mouth and it has a crust from the flat top grill that adds that hint of char. The hot crispy fries come with: Maui Onion Sea Salt  Garlic Chili Aioli and sliced Jalepeno peppers. Its the bomb dot com...Drop the Mike!",

From the Host, to the server (who didn't want to be our server!!!) even the manager couldn't follow thru~   A 20 min wait to be seated turned into a 40 min wait~ well that's OK CUZ these burgers are worth the wait!!!! NOT THIS NIGHT THEY WERENT!!!!    Get seated, wait 15 min for server to approach, ONLY to find out she will ONLY be getting our drink order ~ OK, we get it the server in our station is in the weeds...(or overwhelmed for u not in the biz) We get our drinks rather timely, 10 min. She's back about 10 min later saying \" I guess I am your server after all\" WTF???? OK...we order, & her parting words \"it will be 30 min for ur order\" COME ON! 2 BURGERS???      We get it, they're busy, however the restaurant wasn't full ~ about 7 empty tables and they're not near closing time yet~    I am gonna cut 2 the chase~ our burgers had to be sent back, manager said he'd be back by, he DIDN'T!     The ONLY THING THAT CAME FAST WAS THE CHECK!!! And she ran my CC in record time, picked up the signed receipt before the ink was dry and was gone......     I am not sure what all the issues where on this night, I have been here numerous times & will return again cuz everyone deserves a 2nd chance~ Hopefully this was just a blip on their radar.",

    "text": "Finally. That word describes how I felt upon arriving to bachi. My good friend Dmagic had raved about this place for awhile and made me excited to give it a whirl.  It took some effort to finally get out there, but we finally made it and oh am I glad we did.   A few friends of mine wanted to make sure we tried a few items, so they ordered the truffle fries as well as the Peking duck buns. Man these buns were solid. I have had similar buns at other locations and these are just as good as other competitors and a must try.   With so many burger options it was sort of overwhelming because all of them sounded so good! But I ended up settling on the Miyagi-son burger. With the onion rings, marinade, and egg with furrikakke, I was blown away. Burger was packed with flavors from all angles.   Oddly enough my favorite part of this burger that I think sets it apart though is the bun. The bun is so soft, but yet has a crispness to it just right on the outer layer. One of the best buns I have had.   One of the cool things about this place too was the fact that even though they are a craft burgers paradise, they were not snobs as other places I have been to are. My brother does not consume bread and wanted a protein style burger and they totally accommodated him with out hesitation. And he loved his burger.   If you are ever in the Vegas area, this is a must stop. I will be back multiple times! I would say this burger is definitely in my top 5 that I have tried, possibly top 3. Awesome.",

There seemed to be a steady stream of people coming in after that.  Service was alright....it did take quite some time to get our food, but for the most part since we knew that the service was bad we made it a point to get what we needed whenever we saw the server.  On to the good stuff....  I decided to order the duck steamed bun. Who doesn't get a burger at a burger joint right? Well I had Arby's for lunch and I didn't feel like a burger. I liked it except for the mint and the fact that the duck was a bit tough to eat. The egg didn't bother me like it did some yelpers. If you are REALLY hungry I would dissuade anyone from ordering this. Luckily, I wasn't too hungry so it filled me up just fine. My friend decided on the Blue and Green Burger. I got to try and bite and I thought it was pretty good. Bacon, mushrooms, blue cheese, veggies and meat....I was impressed with the size of the burger. Good flavors overall. I decided to also try these infamous truffle Parmesan fries.....they were really good; however, next time I come back I will be getting the sweet potato fries. Yes, I will be returning for a burger next time....maybe...the pork belly caught my eye too.",

    "text": "I've heard of this place for a while and finally got to try it this past weekend!  I spent the weekend in Vegas with my friends and on Sunday noon before heading home, we decided to check this place out. They opened at 12 and we got there at 12:20...there was already a 30 minute wait :o This place gets crazy crowded, so I only hoped it was because it was delicious.  Service here is pretty good. Workers were friendly and apologetic about the wait, even though it didn't seem TOO long. They were also very accommodating for out party of 11 :) I decided to order based on Yelp reviews, so I got the 'Ronin Burger' ($10) and our table got 4 orders of their Truffle Parmesan fries ($3.50 each) to share.  Food came out in a reasonable amount of time. It was funny because they recommended we should get the fries now instead of with our burgers because the burgers would take a long time, but we got our burgers a few minutes after we got our fries. So?? Haha I don't know.  The Ronin is a burger with caramelized onions, cole slaw, sesame dressing, fried egg (I asked to take it out since I don't like egg), Katsu BBQ sauce, and a yuzu citrus aioli on the side. The flavor was good, but I found it too be a little too sweet after a while. I think it was because of the BBQ sauce and caramelized onions together. Too much, plus I'm not the biggest fan of BBQ sauce. The truffle parmesan fries were really good. The fries are the thin cut type and were nicely crisp. They also came with a sun dried tomato aioli sauce that was really good with the fries. MMMM :)  Prices are pretty reasonable and this location is pretty spacious. I would come back to try their other popular burgers (Kiki and Miyagi). Also, I hear they have good soft drinks, so I'll probably try those next, too!",

I say \"please be good to us\" everytime we eat here because the food is amazing. But for the past 5 times I've been here nothing has changed so this is honestly the last time I'm eating here. Not only was the food out late, but waiting on the check took a longer process and in between that time, I had asked just about every server in there for it. I never write on here but because the experience was so bad for multiple times, I feel as if something needed to be said.",

    "text": "My sister-in-law was raving about Bachi Burger so for my last night in Vegas, we had dinner here with my brother. I felt pretty overwhelmed with the menu since everything sounds SO GOOD.  If I wasn't feeling broke, I totally would have ordered the Shogun Burger: Wagyu Beef, unagi, pan seared foie gras, poached asian pear, miso butter and Yamamomo peach. ARE YOU FORREAL BACHI BURGER?? I had a foodgasm just reading that decadent description but when I saw that it was $25, I painfully had to choose another burger.  In the end, I went with the bahn mi burger since my sister-in-law read good reviews of this burger. I figured I couldn't go wrong with this since I love bahn mi sandwiches.   According to the description, the bahn mi burger contained the following ingredients: Angus Beef, pork, shrimp, lemongrass, pork pate, fresh herbs, curry aioli, with pickled vegetables and Nuoc Mam Sauce on the side. If I didn't have read the description before chowing down, I wouldn't  have known the pate, pork or shrimp was in this burger. I think there were so many flavors going on that those got lost in the mix. I had my burger cooked to medium and my oh my it was so juicy! I also enjoyed the fresh herbs (aka mint and cilantro), pickled veggies the curry aioli. Those flavors when so well together! I personally thought the Nuoc Mam sauce (aka fish sauce) was unnecessary since there was a lot of other flavors going on. Overall I really enjoyed this burger.  The three of us split the truffle parmesean fries, which were very tasty by themselves. The black porchini creme sauce that was drizzled over it was just as tasty but I felt that the sun dried tomato aioli was unnecessary for dipping.  Despite what other reviews have mentioned, I though the service was fine. My sister-in-law was also surprised since she did mention service was slow at Batchi Burger. I guess we came in on a good night.  I highly recommend checking out this place. The Shogun Burger is on the top of my \"To-Do\" list when I visit Vegas again.",

Delicious burgers ranging from 10-18 a burger, plus 2-6 for fries... Not bad in my opinion.  Came here twice in a period of 5 days and each time was unbelievable...   Some of the best burgers I've ever had in my life..  Note to owners: please open this restaurant in the La Quinta, CA area!!! We need a burger place like this!!",

Our waitress, Erica, was extremely pleasant throughout our whole dining experience, frequently checking up on us to make sure we had everything we needed.  FOOd ordered: - Oxtail chili cheese fries: declicious, plentiful helping of chili and cheese along with jalepenos - Ronin burger: coleslaw and egg in the burger, the bottom bun got a little soggy toward the end (i actually preferred my friend's Kiki burger) - Kiki burger: sweet kick to the taste, bacon makes everything taste good - onion rings: thinly sliced onion rings in batter, kind of like an onion tempura  BOTH BURGERS WERE OOZING WITH TASTY JUICES ** there are no substitutions for any of their menu items **  I most def RECOMMEND this place and I will definitely be coming back here again to try something different!  The food and service were superb - drinks were always filled and food came out pretty quickly.  Prices are decent as well.  This place is right next to the movie theater so maybe that's why it's busy sometimes.  Just go on a weekday then you won't have a wait!",

    "text": "Here are a couple interesting facts: In Japanese, \"Bachi\" are those wooden sticks used to play the taiko drums. In Polish, \"Bachi\" means grandmother...well it's actually Babcia but sounds like bachi.  Bottom line: If you like burgers, you'll have to try Bachi out.  Personally, I wouldn't go out of my way to try this burger joint again.  My reference point is Umami's Burger.  I'm a pictures person so check out my links to view the pictures I've uploaded of: 1. Oxtail Chili Cheese fries - This is their staple dish so give it a shot and try it for yourself.  Beware of the the jalapenos, they are a real kicker!  The shreded meat will give you a different texture so don't let your mind fool you into thinking \"this should taste like the regular ground beef chili cheese fries\" because it won't.  I wasn't that impressed.  2. Ronin Burger - Must try! The Caramelized onions and egg on this burger was awesome.  If you like the sweetness of caramelized onions, this is a must try.  Didn't really experience much of the japanese cole slaw inside the burger.    3. Pork Belly Bao - The steamed bao bun was lukewarm at best, not the typical not hot and steamy bao, which was a disappointment.  It reminded me of defrosted bao bread microwaved and then left out at room temp, it simply did not taste fresh.  The Pork belly was a thick cut but if it's a thick cut of fat...no bueno.  I'd pass on this.  However, the sliced boiled egg was a pleasant surprise in the bao.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I entered bachi burger with the thought of exotic flavors and delicious high-quality beef. Though the beef may have been exceptional, we both were disappointed with how overpowering the flavors were of everything else other than the beef. Cooked perfectly at medium, we would have liked the burger to not be completely overshadowed by what was an addition to it.   He got the Miyagi-San burger which tasted more like sushi than it did hamburger (and I took a bite of it!) I got the Ronin burger where I thought the Katsu BBQ sauce was way too sweet and made it hard to keep eating.  Call me \"old-fashioned\" or \"all-American\" but I'll take a Great Burger where I taste the beef before these two options any day,   For $40 + dollars, we had two burgers, two sides of fries, a beer and a green tea. I hoped to actually enjoy my meal rather than us question to one another whether the burgers were worth even worth eating.   We found more enjoyment giggling over the green sunglasses with no lenses, neon orange shirt wearing hipster next to us than our food. I was so excited about this place. But it just wasn't good, in our opinion.  Wait... the fries were good! Two stars.",

When I went to pick it up.. They didn't make it because they said their policy was that all orders needed a credit card before they would make it. Really! Tell your staff then, cause I tried to pay on the phone ! No apologies, nothing! They are very full of themselves. The food is good but it doesn't make up for the hassle of trying to eat here.

I liked the simple decor with really awesome art on display.  Our server was a real sweet guy too.  I got the Spicy Miso Burger (the special) and it was SOOOOOOOOOO tasty.  It was the best spicy burger I'd ever had.  It had a fried egg that was cooked to perfection. The sweetness of the creamy yolk went really well with the spiciness from the peppers and sauce.  The bun was soft, but crisp in between from the grill.  It's super messy, but all in the right ways.  This NEEDS to be permanent on the menu because I want to eat it every time!  I also got the garlic, salt, and pepper french fries, which came with a spicy mayo sauce.  It was super good especially with the burger.  Very garlicy, but delicious.  My friend got the short rib steamed bun and I tried one (it came with three).  It was a great combo of flavor.  The meat was delicious and tender and the vegetables complimented the flavors.  The radish gave it a freshness that was just indescribable.  She also got the plain fries and I tried the sauce that came with it and was surprised.  The pineapple ketchup is surprisingly un-pineapple like.  It's sweet and a good compliment to the steamed buns.  We also got the Portuguese donuts dessert. It was sooooo good. The donuts are fried to order and go amazingly well with the icecream.  Together it tastes like a deconstructed fried icecream.  Really great.  I'll definitely order it again.  Great place...I'm going to try to go there again this week!",

Also looooove the chicken.  The last time I went I ordered their salad (mandarin oranges and cucumbers in it...not sure what it was called).

So I was expecting great things when we rolled in here yesterday.    First of all, I was surprised that it was Asian-influenced burgers - I thought this was going to be a better version of Fatburger or something.  (Sorry Mike, I didn't actually read your review.)  Somewhat skeptical, I ordered the \"banh mi\" burger and the garlic salt/pepper fries.  I was not disappointed with how tasty it was.  You can read the multitude of other reviews created by more polished writers than myself to get a sense of the food.  Despite being in a typical Vegas strip mall, the decor makes for a \"hey this place is pretty cool\"-type meal with friends or maybe a casual date.  There are some nice stylistic touches like the silver cup used for the french fries and pint glasses that have a sold feed to them.    Suffice to say, I'll be back to try the other burgers.",

Sorry to say her experience was of disappointment. We ordered their famous oxtail chili cheese fries. There was no sight of oxtail anywhere in the dish unless the meat just melted! The burgers were good but slightly oily and the one thing that REALLY annoyed me was how slow their service was. Granted it was lunch time but it wasn't super busy. We all thought the cooks went on break or something because everyone's food came out all at the same time. By that I meant all the other tables in the restaurant and not just our food! Our waiter, a young gentleman, was clearly already having a bad day but if you're working in customer service, he should know better not to let his emotions come through. I'd rather go to the strip for a Shake Shack burger any day!",

As a frequent diner of Bachi Burger, I have tried almost everything on their menu. Nothing has been less than amazing! Try their specialty burgers, I suggest the Ronin, Kalbi, or Banh-Mi Burgers. You will enjoy some of the best flavors your pallet will ever taste.   Their fries, are unreal. Crispy, and packed with well balanced flavors you will find nowhere else.They have recently changed their Garlic Salt & Pepper Fries, making them, hands down, the best fries I've ever had!  Dessert? Bachi Burger's Strawberry Pop Tarts, and Portuguese Dough-Nuts are superior to most fine dining restaurants. Adding to them, is a side of unique ice creams, you can't get at DQ... Truly the work of a master pastry chef.  The service has improved tremendously, and the kitchen staff still putting it down! They get better and better every time I eat there. Making them a well rounded, well oiled machine of awesomeness! Stepping up to the plate to handle the demands of their quickly rising popularity. And still keeping their prices rediculously low, at about $10-$15 per person. Way to go! Amazing what you can do with a staff that cares, huh?  I will continue to spend my paychecks with them, until they cut me off..  P.S. I suggest the Chili Fried Chicken for an appetizer, they're to die for!",

    "text": "This place is a real gem. It's probably the best, most innovative burger joint I have ever been to.  A group of 5 of us came in and we ordered: kalbi burger, grilled bachi fish, spicy miso burger (special), and kiki's burger.  It took about 20 min to come out and it was well worth the wait. We sampled each others burger and they all brought a different taste to each. Very fresh and very juicy for burgers cooked to medium. Kalbi burger had a small kick to it, and tasted like the bachi pickles appetizers you find in korean restaurants. Kiki's burger tasted like a mushroom and swiss, but gourmet. It almost tastes like they steam the patties! My fav was the grilled bachi burger. The sauce was tangy and the fish was really mild and soft. Not overcooked at all. The spicy miso burger consisted of radish sprouts, the patty, and a miso sauce that just mixes together so well.  We opted for the portugese donuts with green tea ice cream. It was a nice ending to the meal. Came out piping hot and the ice cream complemented it well.  Definitely coming back for the wagyu burgers in a couple days.",

I can't believe they only charge $8 for these things! We did have to wait awhile for our burgers (minor mixup) but the wait was totally worth it. Great staff, clean place, nice decor. We will most def be back. And soon!",

    "text": "The food was great, but our service was terrible from start to finish. First, our server was inattentive. She didn't give us an attitude but she seemed like her mind was elsewhere. We were just a party of five, but ran out of tea and water regularly. We each ordered fries, but some came as appetizers and some during the meal with no explanation. The extra sauces we ordered with the meal weren't brought to us. We had to ask for them again. To top it off they screwed up the meal ticket. As our party was seated we had asked our server if she could create two tickets. She said, \"yea, no problem.\" At the end of our meal she brought us one ticket, not two. We tried to talk to her, but after five minutes of waiting we couldn't find her. At this point we were fed up with the service and just wanted to leave. Three party members pooled cash for their meals and tip. Our server still nowhere in sight, I walked the check up to the manager and explained that he should put $33 on the card, the rest of our ticket was paid in cash. He delegated it to a man who clearly didn't understand how to operate their payment system. My card was promptly charged the entire $97. A simple apology was offered, no more. I signed the receipt, got the cash back, and left. The next day I had to rush to the bank and deposit the cash so that my insurance bill would clear.  Sure the burgers and fries were great, but the service us five received was terrible. In Vegas if you really want a good burger there are plenty of other places with better food AND service.",

    "text": "Went for Lunch today, Sun, @ 1:30pm. Place was about 1/2 full and there were 3 wait staff working. This is the 2nd time I am here. The first time, I had the Ronin burger. OK, but a bit over the top for me with a bunch of stuff on it. In my past review, I gave it a 3 star. Today, I am going simple. BBQ Bachi Burger, medium, sweet potato fries, and chicken kara-age.  Like the last time, despite the fact that there were 3 wait staff, the service was somewhat slower than at many other restaurants. 3 times, I had to flag the wait staff down to ask for things. -1 star for slow service.  The Chicken Kara-age came first, average portion for $6. The visual was not what I expected, the kara-age very dark in color and not the golden brown I'm used to seeing, so immediately, I was a bit skeptical. However, it turned out to be pretty good. The color is dark because they seem to marinade the chicken some type of Teriyaki type sauce which is giving it not only the dark color, but a sweet, salty taste as you bite in. It comes with some sort of chili mayo dip which has some kick to it. Not Bad.  The sweet potato fries and the burger came together. The swee potato fries is one of the best I have had so far. Very tasty. It is sprinkled with what they say is a Kaffir Lime Hawaiian Salt (OK, I never would have known if it was not on the menu) and ground peppers. The sweetness of the potato, the salt, and the pepper gives a nice balance of taste. The yuzu citrus aioli gives you an option of adding a bit of citrus taste to the combo.  The BBQ Bachi burger was awesome. Done perfectly to medium, with tons of juices flowing. The slight sweetness of the bun goes well with the BBQ burger. By the way BBQ is not the tangy type of BBQ sauce, but rather more the soy type like a Teriyaki BBQ. I prefer this burger over the Ronin that they have.  4 stars this time around for what I had. I wish they would improve on their service.",

    "text": "Here is my experience with Bachi Burger.  I went in after work to order a burger and salad.  I was directed towards the bar area and I looked over the menu.  I ordered the Myagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger that comes with Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, caramelized Bacon, crispy onion rings for $15.00 (it used to be $13.50 in 2014). The waitress asked how would I like it cooked and I told her medium. I asked the waitress if they could substitute the caramelized bacon for sweet onion marmalade and she said she can leave the caramelized bacon off but she would have to charge me for the sweet onion marmalade as an add on $1.50.  I reluctantly agreed and added a market salad which came with spring mix, heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots and a champagne vinaigrette $5.00.  So the burger and salad plus tax came to $23.24 before tip to which I tipped $3.00 since It was take out to a total of $26.00.  When I paid the waitress she told me to give the $30.00 to the bartender to get change and he gives me back $6.76 ( a five dollar bill and a one dollar bill with the .76 in change.  Now I don't know if he thought that someone should get $1.76 or a $5.00 tip for take-out.  I'm not cheap by no means but I tip what is appropriate since I myself work in a tip job.  I had to ask him for change for the $5.00.  That didn't bother me too much but I felt I should add it to this review because that was the (tipping point).  When I got home I opened the burger and it looked good and messy but when i looked inside they left off the Furikake which really gives it a distinct flavor, luckily i have some at home so no big deal, but when I took a bite the burger was rare in the middle an hard over-cooked on the outside, not medium like I asked for. Plus if that was grass fed I really couldn't tell it didn't taste better than any In-and Out Burger that I ever had.  The company where they get their meat from must be inferior to others. Then I go to the box that was containing the salad and I opened it up and no salad dressing.  I called them up to tell them about the mistakes.  I was told I could come back and get the dressing with apologies.  I also told them about the burger and they just gave me this puppy dog look like I'm so sorry.  I told them that's okay and walked out of there vowing never to return.  Well if I want a burger similar to the one I ordered than I can go to Fukuburger and get it for $7.99 + fries $3.99 + drink $2.55 + $3.00 tip for  $19.00.  There are plenty of burger joints wanting the extra business that don't gouge their customers and will sub out ingredients at no charge.  So dine there if you like to spend money.  You won't see me there.  The STAFF were nice I do have to say.  I would give them 5 stars.",

The meat was super tender and slightly more sweet than beef. Cooked perfectly. I had the Spicy Miso Burger for main course, cooked medium rare. It is the best burger I've ever had at a restaurant. Cooked nice and juicy and seasoning was just on point. They also had a very cool beer selection of a lot of imported japanese ones you can't find anywhere else. It sells itself as a asian-fusion burger spot and it does not disappoint.   Remembering the food makes me want to jump in my car and go right now for a burger. Hands down the place to go for a burger. AMAZING!",

The service is Okay only because its a small business that can't afford to fully staff the dining area when it gets really busy. Be patient with the service because it's a local business and it's impossible to hire enough people to work the rush on a Saturday night.

    "text": "BUZZ - Bahn Mi Burger - Kiki Burger - Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - Ronin Burger (5/10) - Shogun Burger (6/10)  I ALSO TRIED - Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns (6/10)  Ok, I'll admit, I was a little tipsy before coming here (it's Vegas!) but that only affects decisions, and not taste buds. Alright?! Case in point, I ordered the Ronin burger instead of the Kiki burger. Should've been a no-brainer because Kiki had garlic and Ronin didn't. ARGH! oh well....  So, someone said that this was on Diners Drive Ins & Dives and I didn't believe them, because this is neither a dive, nor is it tiny as hell. It's like an average sized burger joint -- not quite Red Robin, but like a smaller Smashburger or Five Guys. And well, the prices...they're average with a gourmet burger place $9-$10, unless you get the Shogun.   DUCK STEAMED BUNS So, these were pretty decent. They're served on steamed buns, but folded into like a small taco (steamed bun is about the size of a drink coaster). Flavor was sort of a sweet, soy, teriyaki kind of flavor, but the seasoning was pretty good.   RONIN BURGER It's got Miso dressing, Katsu BBQ, and a fried egg, amongst some others. You know why I know I was drunk? I would never order a burger with Miso anything! I like miso, but not outside Japanese food, and especially not on a burger.  Luckily for me, the miso is hard to taste, and as for the fried egg, I don't understand what the novelty is. Among the very light and almost hard to find flavors the patty was not seasoned enough, giving to a very lackluster performance. The flavors were enough that you can taste that they're not absent, but it's not enough to really notice. It did have a small sweet and salty persuasion, but again, nothing worth mentioning.  SHOGUN BURGER Whenever I try a new joint (especially if it's hyped), I assume that I'll never come back. I make sure to order as much on the menu as possible. This guy was eyeing me the whole time. $25 burger! So, feeling very generous, and drunk (it's Vegas!), I ordered one for the table. I split it into 8ths and gave a piece to everyone. Most thought it wasn't much better, but I thought it was definitely better than the Ronin.  It's not just beef, it's Wagyu Beef! And on top of that, there's Unagi and Foie Gras! It's also got peach and miso butter (can't escape miso tonight I guess (Vegas?)). The beef is noticeably more tender, and the flavors and seasoning are better. Now, I don't think I actually got any unagi in my bite, so I'm a little disappointed, yet the thought of fishy eel next to beef is a little worrisome. The sweetness this times comes from a little unagi sauce, which worked ok. There were certainly improvements in this burger over the Ronin, but not $15's worth!  BADCHI BURGER Ok, my friends all picked on me because I was the only one that thought Bachi was less than orgasmic. I don't know, maybe I'm not all about the \"gourmet\" burger, but I feel like lately everyone's so worried about their toppings, they keep forgetting about the beef. Sure it's Angus, sure it's Waygyu, but that doesn't mean you don't have to season it or cook it properly! The patty isn't just filler protein, it's the main event!   So, if you've never had it, fine, quell your curiosity. Otherwise, just go to In-n-Out.  Everyone's tastes are different, so here're some of my references (not in any order): NOT A FAN: Fatburger, Five Guys, Tom & Eddies, Kuma's Corner FAN: In-n-Out, Paradise Pup, Smashburger",

    "text": "Second those that have said this place has 5 star potential with some service kinks. It is new, however, and I have faith that this place can get it together !  Location: like others have said, it's hard to find. Pull into the parking lot across from Vons and aim for the NW corner tucked away.   The menu is freaking awesome. Creative. reasonably priced. AND cool drinks! Bada** beers (Honey Wheat, Sam Adams Cherry, as well as the Japanese staples). Priced around $5 a beer that seems about right.   We dined for lunch so I tried a Mango milk tea. It was alright. It took like 15 minutes to show up, but again that gets back to those new restaurant service kinks.   Grilled cheese - I read Keith's review but stupidly ordered it anyways. It's overpriced ($7) and wasn't special. There's all these yummy gourmet ingredients but honestly the sandwich had the taste/texture/consistency of a white cheddar grilled cheese sandwich. I think they need to work on this dish a bit.   Bachi wagyu burger (5 oz for $9). I enjoyed the subtle bbq sauce they added to the burger. The bun was delicious and soft. They had tons of unique burger options but we stuck with the classic. It was a nice take on the classic cheeseburger. The 5 oz size is absolutely perfect. You feel full but not disgusting after eating it! They didn't ask us how we liked it cooked - mb next time we'll specify medium. Either way the burger has so much more flavor and moisture and goodness than Create or Cheeburger in my opinion!  Classic fries - really great fries and the pineapple ketchup is uber yummy! Yup we were boring on this choice as well.  I love forwad to returning this place over and over again. The menu has so many cool options! Props to them for opening a truly unique burger concept in a town of too many burger joints!",

    "text": "Oh Bachi - it hurts me to write this review, but I do it out of love!  I love Bachi's food, burgers, and drinks, but they are seriously losing their edge. I had heard disappointed reviews from my friends and checked it out for myself.  There was a wait, but that is to be expected at Bachi. My date and I didn't mind eating at the bar like we normally do, but the host told us we couldn't. When we asked why, he said that different managers had different policies, so because we did it last time didn't mean we could do it this time, but maybe we could next time. Seriously? That's weird. We grabbed drinks at the bar while we waited.  When we were seated, I asked for a cider cocktail, as advertised on their chalk board, but they were out of their draft cider. Ok. Waiter suggested a different drink which I ordered. We waited...waited...waited...our food finally came - but my drink still had not come! My date ordered a beer when our food arrived and called attention to the fact that I still didn't have my drink. The waiter said it would be just a minute.  We were checked on by another employee and mentioned the missing drinks. She said it would be just a minute.   I did finally get my drink, which was yummy, halfway through my burger.  -Long wait -Inconsistent policies about where people can eat -Keg out -Bad service -Getting a drink after getting my food -No apology or acknowledgment  Bachi - I would have ordered another drink and dessert, but I didn't even get to finish my drink - what gives? Please return to your former 5 star glory!",

    "text": "So I have to admit that lately Guy Fieri has been letting me down with some of his recommendations, and particularly his Vegas restaurant at The Quad. However, this was my second visit to Bachi Burger, and this place still rocks. We were three ravenous hikers fresh off a three hour drive back from Zion, still coming down from the adrenaline high of hiking Angel's Landing. So naturally we stuffed our faces with the truffle fries (fantastic), kiki burger (amazing), spicy miso burger (good), peking duck steamed buns (good but covered in cilantro which I HATE), and I topped all that off with a chocolate peanut butter milkshake (good... but definitely overkill at that point). The Asian fusion is right on point, and the burgers are clearly made with high quality ingredients with a lot of thought going into the various flavor combinations.  My only complaint is that the bathrooms were not very clean and they made us wait for a table at 3 PM on a Sunday, even though the restaurant seemed pretty empty. Also the parking lot (where you have to wait for your table) smells horrendous because there is a dumpster full of rotting fish from the sushi restaurant next door.",

The Summerlin location is always too busy and the wait can be atrocious so I avoid it.  What I have found during my Bachi Burger tour is that they are very consistent.  I am a big fan of the Ronin and Miyagisan Burgers and no matter which location I have had them they are always the treat I expect them to be.       I usually end up at Bachi Burger due to friends being in town and hearing about this Vegas treat form Triple D or from Yahoo's beat burgers in the US by state.  I am never upset when asked to meet up at Bachi's.  My friends quickly become jealous of the fact I can have Bachi anytime I want.      The service at this location was better then the other 2.  The Summerlin being the worst of the 3 due to servers being overwhelmed.  The Burger was exceptional and unlike any other Burger I have had.  Unique and delicious.  The Ox Tail fries were a treat as always and one order was shared by 3 of us.  it was plenty and we were glad we only ordered one.      Their prices are on the high side but considering the quality and the uniqueness of their burgers it is well worth splurging on.  I am looking forward to another visit soon :)",

The shogun burger is my go to burger, but today I decided to try the miyagi-San burger and it's was yummy! The chili mayo paired with the grass fed wagyu beef with furikaki and onion rings were a tasty treat.  Definitely try this burger :)   Honestly for me, nothing beats the shogun burger. Foie gras and wagyu pair together so wonderfully! The presentation alone is executed exceptionally.  The first bite is heavenly. Juicy. Flavorful. Surprising. Yes I am still talking about the shogun! If you got the extra cash to fork up $26 for a burger do so! It sounds like a lot for meat slapped between 2 buns, but it's well worth it!   Overall a nice modern style restaurant with attentive staff! Clean. Cohesive. Prompt. Great service and always smiling faces!!!!",

    "text": "If I could give 6 stars, i would.  I had heard about this place for over a year from co-workers who travel to Vegas regularly.  I get my share of Vegas as well but this place is about 6 miles away from the strip and I hear it's a pain to get a cab back.  So it's taken me nearly a year to try this place, but i'm glad i finally made it!  Enough storytelling, time for the good stuff.  Bachi Burger puts an Asian spin of the traditional burger and combines some of the things you love in Asian cooking into a sandwich.  Our goal was to try as many of the burgers as we could as there were three of us.  First, great beer selection here!  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries and it was a perfect side option for 3 people.  Comes with an egg on top.  The yolk mixed in with the chili and cheese is just the right amount of gooey goodness.  Again the goal was to try as many burgers as we can so we each decided to get something unique and promised to eat one half and split the other half into two so we can all get a taste of each other's.  This was a brilliant idea and I recommend you all try this if going as a group.  Burger # 1: Miyagi Burger - It's their signature burger and comes with grass fed kobe beef patty, some sort of amazing sauce, fried egg and onion strings.  Amazing texture and taste Burger # 2: Spicy Miso: Simple with an amazing spicy sauce that provides just the right amount of heat. This was my favorite! Burger # 3: Unagi Burger:  This one costs $24 but it's well worth the price.  It was a little too sweet and rich for my taste but def worth a try  So after all this we sat there.  Our stomachs were full but we still wanted to end with a bang. The debate was if we wanted dessert, and if so which ones.  Except I had another brilliant idea and recommended we get another burger and split it in three.  I think we were all thinking the same thing, I was brave enough to say it.  So we sat and wondered what else are we going to go with.  Our wonderful server recommended the Mr. Hong, since it was different than what we had already tried.  And what a great recommendation it was!    So like I said, in the beginning, I'd give this place 6 starts if I could.  Not only was the food great, our server made sure we were taken care of from the moment we walked in.  I'm making Bachi Burger my go to destination every time I visit Vegas.",

I admit I saw this place on \"diners, drive-ins, and dives\" BUT as annoying as I find Guy Fieri, the Food Network comes up with awesome places for him to review. This place is no exception.  The oxtail chili cheese fries are to die for. Seriously, what can be better than a delicious oxtail stew smothering perfectly crisp fries? A FRIED EGG. I can't really say anything else. I'm still salivating.   The steam buns with pork belly were very good, not great. Don't get me wrong, they were very tasty, but the pork belly was a little dry and the fat was chewy - it didn't melt in your mouth.  We ordered a Mr. Ho burger which comes with a taro bun! A TARO BUN! It actually tastes like taro! Surprisingly delicious!   The kimchi burger was perfectly cooked. The kimchi was delicious, and the pickled cucumbers were super authentic.   Oooohhh! I almost forgot they have angry orchard ON TAP! And they have a fireball angry orchard cocktail. Yeah, I know - pretty perfect.   Honestly, nothing I say can give you the experience of eating great food, with perfect music, a super friendly staff and epic urban graffiti decor. just come here!",

One hour later I got my order (1 burger, gyoza, ramen). The broth was cold and it was unusually salty. Dine in was slow and it's hard to get the attention of staff.

That was absolutely delicious.  Very fresh.  Grass fed.  Flavorful.  The bun was tremendous.  Received a lot of recommendations from different people to try this place out.  Made my way there.  Called ahead of time and boy I was not disappointed.  Also the appetizer with the Chili Fried Chicken is something off the chain.  That sauce was amazing on that sucka........Next time I go there, i will have to try this oxtail chili cheese fries.  If you reside in the Vegas area and have not tried this place out, you really are doing yourself a disservice!  If it was located in my city (ATL),  it would be top 5....easily!   Overall: B+ / A-",

Japanese cole slaw, caramelized onions, and a fried egg on a burger.  I think I destroyed the burger within a few minutes and it was a decent size.  Every burger shop should add fried eggs on their burgers.  It was sweet and refreshing.  Maybe a little too sweet for my liking, but overall a good burger.  My buddy had the Miyagi-san burger.  With the onion rings, the burger looked massive.  The furikake (seasoning) went very well with the burger.  I had a bite of the burger and the taste still lingered as we walked back to our car.  Next time I'm getting this burger.     As a pork bun enthusiast, I naturally had to order them.  I like Bachi Burger's version of the steam pork bun.  The bun was not soft and fluffy but the pork, egg, and herbs totally blew my mind.  Like I said earlier, eggs should be added be everything.  I'm very glad I went here after my flight.  Totally worth the food coma while driving 3 hours to Zion National Park.",

I also suggest the moco loco which my mom had and it was great as well.   My only draw back from this place is the food and service took forever. I think our server was new so she didn't really have the hang of asking people what they need and taking their orders in a timely matter.   I was excited about the chili fries because that's what really sold me on coming to this place but unfortunately we never got them. We had gotten all our food (not all at once though) and kept asking the servers about our fries. But we couldn't wait any longer. We ate our food and had to cancel the order because we wanted to eat the fries with our burgers. Luckily the manager or owner came around to ask how everything was and we had to tell him we never got our fries and to cancel the order.  He was very nice about it and also very apologetic. Kinda nice they didn't come because we were pretty full!   Other than that the food was great!",

    "text": "For the LOVE of FOIE!!  I knew I had to make a trip to out Bachi Burger the next time I was in Las Vegas when I heard about the Shogun Burger!  I could tell that this restaurant was not your ordinary burger joint after taking one glance at the menu.  This is one of the more modern restaurants that serve types of burgers you would not typically find at your local burger joint.  Bachi Burger offers various Japanese-inspired burgers, dishes, and sides.   The SHOGUN BURGER consists of Wagyyu Beef & Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, and Yamamomo Peach  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=Xc_YmEWXC7Rmv-9fncsOGA#Xc_YmEWXC7Rmv-9fncsOGA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>).  To be honest, my first bite was a little overwhelming from all the different flavors going on, lol.  But all the flavors melded together perfectly.  The wagyu beef was tender, juicy, and cooked to perfection.  The sweetness and tender poached Asian pear.  The rich, pan seared, slice of foie gras.  All of this, drizzled in miso butter, topped with arugula, in between a home made sweet bun  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=W9bCuQYgNjg2W-Fb2BBDkw#W9bCuQYgNjg2W-Fb2BBDkw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>).  Foie is already very rich to begin with, so I was not able to finish this burger in one sitting-- especially since we ordered sides as well.  I tried some of my friend's CRUSTy CRAB Burger, but the burger was too salty for my liking.  It was difficult to taste all the flavors and ingredients in the burger but it wasn't too bad.  (Crab cake burger with mango chutney and tartar sauce).  The concept of making a \"Spongebob-type\" burger is cute though.  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=JHZOUMJ4_JqyKjvo6aHHzg#JHZOUMJ4_JqyKjvo6aHHzg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>).    The SWEET POTATO FRIES were fresh, crispy, lightly salted, and served with a Yuzu Citrus Aioli dipping sauce  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=xgwqimbyTmxJTnzr7bRITg#xgwqimbyTmxJTnzr7bRITg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>).  If you are  afan of sweet potato fries, you will not be disappointed!  The TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES were delicious.  Made with fresh cut potatos, tossed in white truffle oil, parmesan reggiano, porcini cream, served with sun dried tomato aioli  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QgvNAbzuAF7sNnz7TpFy0g&userid=F28n26ynklEioZDInyK__A\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>).    If I weren't so full I would have ordered a few more items on the menu that made my mouth water:  the Peking Style Duck Steamed buns, Pork Belly Steamed Buns,  and Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.  But that's just a few more reasons to come back! Woohoo!",

The funny part was the girl would say \"take your time\" right after trying to take something away prematurely and us saying we weren't done with it, and also after the most rushed check drop ever. Um, thanks? Between that and the horrible music choices (2011 called and wants Party Rock by LMFAO back), I don't think we'll be coming back.",

    "text": "Forget about the fact that you'll be spending about $20 for a burger and fries.  It was Saturday night on the strip and craving a burger at around 11:15pm.  Not to worry, Bachi Burger is open til midnight on Saturdays.  So after a quick drive to an unsuspecting strip mall off Windmill, you'll find some unique gourmet-ish type burgers to kill that craving. It was my first time there so of course I had to have a burger but there are definitely some other things on the menu that I'd love to go back for and try ... like the chili fried chicken, pork buns or the oxtail chili cheese fries.  But I stuck with the plan and had the Miyagi San grass-fed Wagyu burger that had chili mayo,  fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon and crispy onion rings. You pretty much feed any cows grass and you know that shit will taste delicious.   I really can't tell the difference between the grass fed beef compared to others but the burger was damn tasty and I'd definitely come back to Bachi Burger when in LV even though it's off the strip.  So if you're craving a burger while in Sin City, haven't lost all your money gambling and drinking and have means of transportation to get here.  Give the place a try, just expect to overpay for a burger and fries but then remember again where you are.  Yup, LV.",

    "text": "If the off-Strip food scene of Las Vegas is destined to emulate the original neighborhood restaurants that make up the great American food cities, then Bachi Burger is one of the quirky places that will help pave the way. With Asian-inspired burgers, house-made Japanese pickles, and boba milk teas alongside delicate salads, truffle fries, and Portugese donuts, it appears the chef is a bit scatter-brained, but almost all of his creations are well-balanced and skillfully executed.  The juicy burgers are served on grilled sweet rolls - a unique approach. The more creative burgers are better than the plain versions, though I wasn't crazy about 'The Crusty Crab.' The sweet chutney was quite tasty, but there wasn't enough textural complexity so the soft crab cake and soft bun ended up tasting mushy in tandem. I really enjoyed 'Kiki's Burger' with sauteed Shiitake &amp; Eryngi mushrooms, caramelized bacon and sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and a garlic chili aioli on the side ($8, pictured above), as well as 'The Lonely Bird,' made from ground chicken and turkey topped with herb pesto, lettuce, tomato, and onion ($7.50). I'm not sure about soy alongside pesto (soy is in all the burgers), but the patty was juicier than most beefless burgers I've had.  The salads are light and fresh, though they are a little too upscale for a burger joint and therefore fairly expensive for their size. The oriental chicken salad with organic jidori chicken breast was my favorite ($9), but maybe that's just because it went better with the theme of the restaurant. I love the Japanese pickles that change regularly, and for $3 they make the perfect amuse. The garlic butter and truffle edamame ($3) and crispy sweet potato fries with yuzu citrus aioli ($4) are worth ordering, but pass on the shrimp toasts which are more interesting on paper than on a plate.  Once Bachi Burger refines a few of their menu items and improves the vibe of the space, I believe it will become very successful. The prices are right and you won't find food like it elsewhere in Vegas, so it's on my list of recommended restaurants.",

We wanted something off the beaten path (not on the Strip), something the locals would frequent...Yelp lead me to Bachi Burger.    When we arrived at the restaurant, it was pretty busy at 9PM on a Friday, but there was still a few tables available, so we were seated right away.    Looking over the menu, I was impressed.  Their burgers had some asian flare.  I ordered the Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger which had Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon ,Crispy Onion Rings. The mister had the Bachi Fish which is Furikake Dusted Pan Seared Alaskan Cod Tartar Sauce, Lettuce, Onion, Tomato Bubu Arare Rice Crackers.  We also had the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries.  I washed it down with a sake cocktail: The \"Katsushiro\": White Peach, Strawberry Puree, Soda.  It was a yummiest, but I don't think it had a lot of alcohol because I didn't get relaxed from it.     My burger was really tasty and very juicy.  I loved the asian inspired flavors.  It was so good I ate the whole think. The bachi fish was good, but it was a bit salty.  The fries were good too.    Who knew that Vegas could have this kind of food and it wasn't on the strip.  Very cool.  I would definitely come back.",

As we pulled-up, we could see the line that was already waiting which was a good sign.  As we waited, we surveyed the menu so we could speed-up our ordering process.  We agreed to order several burgers so we could cut them up and share them with each other.  Started-off and ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries and Oxtail Chili Fries which were awesome.  We ordered the Ronin, Miyagi-San, Spicy Miso, Kalbi and Black and Green burgers.  Needless to say they were all very good.  A bit pricey, but not like I'm going to order these every week.  A definite must try if you're in the area.  Service was also very good.",

Only sad part is that each burger you order doesn't come with any fries or a drink. So just be ready to spend about $17-$25 a person. But can't be beat for the price!",

They also had what is now one of my favorite beers on the planet called Hitachino Nest IPA - this is Japanese Micro Brew and it was phenomenal.  Thank you Bachi Burger!  Food -  I had the pickled vegetable appetizer.   Very cool and tasty.  For $4 I had to try it.  Then I had the Bahn Mi burger - outstanding.  i highly recommend this place.  I spent as much on beer as I did food and it was money well spent.  I will be going back next time I'm in Vegas for sure.

    "text": "\"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas . . . . but let me tell you about the best burger ever!\" This statement was touted among my San Diego foodie friends after a weekend of debauchery in Nevada's finest city.  Despite the meal not fitting within the parameters of fine dining and there was no full bar; we still decided to venture to Las Vegas to investigate these alleged Angus masterpieces.  J2 and I flew out to be met by Erik, Greg and Mike.  All part of the carnivorous maximus species, we have an affinity towards our bovine benefactors.  Upon our arrival at 10:00 pm we were completely famished and ready to dine.  Chef Dave and Chef Lauren, formerly Roy's culinary masters, are the brilliance behind the scenes.  The establishment was reminiscent of a Japanese sushi restaurant without the sushi.  Japanese beer, my personal favorite when I drink beer, was on the menu as well as a myriad of others for those who enjoy an ethnic variety.  Table top, Bachi Burger provides a Bamboo Sea Salt, which seems to be a basic fleur de sel with a green tint.  Leaning next to salt was a high octane spice; sliced garlic and chili marinating in water.  The aroma warned your olfactory senses of the possible impending pain that would ensue with over exposure.  Even a generous portion provided a garlic & chili taste that was so bold, the anticipated pain would have been worth it, however, somehow the spicy bite never reared itself to distract from the pureness as designed.      Today's appetizers were two flavors of fries.  The Truffle Parmesan Fries had minimal truffle taste, however we did enjoy the texture and very light taste of the Black Truffle Porcini Cream that was drizzled across the top.  With dirty fingers and hands, more napkins had to be ordered.  (It is advised to get extra napkins ahead of time; this meal should become messy and not to be eaten in your Armani Suit.)  Salt & Pepper Garlic fries found their way to the scene, and were more traditional, with the exception of the sauce.  Garlic Chili Aioli?  Nice!  Too much of this Red Matter would definitely melt the planet Vulcan.  Although the creaminess of the aioli was soft and relaxing as silk, the Chili taste soon followed to wake your taste buds and start the party.  Add a few drops of that Garlic Chili water  . . .  now that's a tasty fry.  In retrospect, I happily noted that there was no ketchup, nor did we need it.  I would venture to guess that a ketchup request would not only be bad form but also admitting to a poor palate, so don't embarrass yourself.    Perusing the menu, it was obvious why these burgers are so tasty; Wagyu and Angus beef are the chief ingredients.  Although grinding up a perfect Wagyu steak to make a burger struck me as a foodie faux pas, the end result was a mouthful of amazing.  My favorite was the Miyagi San Burger.  Despite it being grass fed, this bovine creation was tender and juicy.  Caramelized bacon and a fried egg provided a palate party platform that held everything together, then a juicy first bite impression of a burger unlike any other that.  A similar taste was found in the Kiki's Burger, as it also had caramelized bacon.  But in this case a thin layer of sweet onion marmalade gave an almost dessert like finish.  A few dips in the provided aioli sauce were the perfect lubricant to pair with this patty.  Combining the thoughts behind those two burgers, I believe they came up with the Ronin burger.  Again the associated unique sauces with the unique ingredients were perfectly paired, in this case Japanese Cole Slaw and Miso Goma with a Yuzu Ailoi.  Very clever, very clever indeed!    Going towards the surf/turf part of the menu, shrimp was introduced into The Bahn-Mi Burger among other spices that offered the full flavor of curry and chili spice, again without the bite that one would anticipate after tasting such a powerful piece.  The creativity award goes to the Crusty Crab, pan roasted crab cake with Mango Chutney.  The preparation of the crab cake in itself was impressive.  The propensity to overcook and over bread the crab cake is so cliche.  In this case, minimal breading yet still firm, this crustacean cake was a divine pairing with the mango chutney.  Bravo!  I extend my compliments to Chef Dave and Chef Lauren with their creativity behind the meaty masterpieces that we devoured.  It would be unfair to juxtapose this establishment against my normal Naomi Wise trained star grading parameters, as those parameters were designed for fine dining establishments.  Suffice it to say, however, in the casual dining arena I have to write 4.5 stars all the way.    Date Night Factor:  Messy food advisory!  Great for a casual date, don't plan on impressing your date with the culinary mess that will result.      Bang for the Buck Barometer:  Pricey for a burger joint, but well worth it.  Two orders of fries, four beers, five burgers and coke set us back $110 with tip.   Return to Eat Probability:  Very High",

Instead I was absolutely mortified about the absolute unprofessional and crude behavior I witnessed.  The food WAS good, I must say that.

I was shocked and appalled that someone would behave like that knowing full and well that children and guests could hear that. The look on my wife's face as well as a few other people around me was that of shock and disbelief.  I'll never go back and I hope you think twice before you do too. I don't want to support that type of business.  I don't care what they were upset about, NOTHING warrants that type of temper tantrum.  So sad too because my server and food was good. Maybe all that anger makes the food good. HAHA.  Too bad I left sick to my stomach.",

    "text": "I don't know if anyone could ever convince me to re-review a restaurant, my first impression is typically good enough for me, and should be for everyone else. Even if you argue that I went to a location on an 'off day' I could really care less, if you are a professional and have opened a restaurant, there should be no such thing as an off day. I will however, go back to a place just for the pure enjoyment if it is good enough. Such is the case with Bachi Burger. I went many months ago, it's been one of the best burgers I've had in Vegas to date and I've had many people ask to go there with me. I've been twice in the last two weeks, and I'm not sure if I'm glad I went back.  Since my first visit, they have finally added a few permanent, lit signs to the outside of the building so its presence is a little more noticeable. The decor hasn't changed at all, with simple loose tables and chairs, plain white walls, and some Asian-inspired photos for sale. I went once for dinner in the middle of the week, and the other day again for lunch. Both times I was able to sit right away unlike the first time, but that's about where the consistency stops. The night I went for dinner it was fairly busy, but our waitress helped us right away with drinks, and took our orders fairly promptly. I had pretty good company that night so I can't remember how long our wait was for the actual food, but between the appetizer and burgers I don't think it was too bad.  My lunch visit was far worse. The friend I was with didn't quite know what she wanted to order right away, so after his first visit our waiter said he'd be back in a few minutes. I think we waited almost 20 minutes for him to return, and at least another 25 for our food to arrive once ordered. We sat down at 12:30pm in the middle of lunch, it was fairly busy but by the time we ordered the place had mostly cleared out so I didn't see why it would take that long. Her unpreparedness aside, our entire lunch took almost an hour and a half from sitting down to finishing our meal, far too long for folks that typically have an hour lunch break around town. I'm not sure if this is a common occurrence during the day, but considering that two out of three meals I've eaten here were sub-par in the service category, I might be noticing a trend here.  The food itself is fantastic. Since having a Kiki burger on my first visit, I have since tried the Ronin burger and the Kalbi burger. Both burgers came out medium rare just as ordered, had all fresh, amazing toppings, and did not disappoint. The different combinations of kim chee, kalbi sauce, fried egg, and other Asian-inspired toppings are all succulent and the best examples of their flavor. I had the pickles during one meal which consisted of not your typical pickles, but pickled daikon, garlic, cauliflower and a few other items. It was delicious and different. Not too filling, but great flavor and a good prep for things to come. Both times I stuck to the parmesan and black truffle fries per request from my company at the table. The fries have great flavor, but during my most recent visit I had the chance to eat some of the fries with little seasoning on them near the bottom, and they weren't too great on their own. Still, all of the fries I have seen and tried here are loaded with seasoning and great in flavor.  I'm not going to bother giving Bachi a new score, the burgers have been incredibly consistent and fantastic, but the service is just not what it should be from visit to visit. If you're not on a lunch break or in a rush, it is well worth the visit and still in my opinion one of the best burgers you can have in town. If impeccable service is your thing, then you need to loosen up a bit and get in here to see what you're missing out on. And if you are an employee of Bachi, please take note of my service comments. I'm sure you get slammed during lunch time and at dinner, but respect the hour-long lunch break and try to find ways to get your customers in and out of there with some efficiency.",

I ordered the Lonely Bird.  I thought the presentation of the burger was simple.  There was nothing too fancy about it.  There was only a toothpick holding the burger in place.  The burger was good and different than most burgers I tasted.  In the Lonely Bird, the patty is chicken and turkey.  Weird?  Yes, but it was fairly tasty.   I really like the taste of the sweet bun.  It was different, but yummy.  Regarding the truffle parmesan fries, I had better, but the taste was decent.  Personally, order one batch of fries because the serving was fairly large.    My boyfriend and I ordered mango boba milk tea.  It tasted sooo good.  It was just as good as the one I ordered in the Philippines.  For dessert, I ordered some type of walnut apple dessert.  The presentation was great, but the taste was meh.    Our server, Lance, reminded me of Justin Long.  He was helpful and made suggestion in our order .   Overall, I would not mind coming here again and trying out other burgers.  They sound and look appetizing.",

I read reviews and realized there might be a wait to eat, so chose a Sunday at 3:00 (in between lunch and dinner) to eat.  The wait was about 20 minutes.  I have since been back 1/2 dozen or so times.  The oxtail chili cheese fries are the BEST!!  I have ordered them every visit.  I've tasted about 4 or 5 of the burgers and they are all delish!  The buns are light and sweet.  There are different flavored aiolis if you are eating plain fries instead of chili cheese ones.  I recommend the garlic or the pesto aioli.  The service can be quite slow at times, and occasionally the wait time for a table can be 45 minutes.  For me, it's definitely worth the wait.",

I had a simple cheeseburger(cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion) and the wifey got a grilled cheese and an order of the parmasean fries. Like I said simple. Burger was good. Nothing special. Wife was disappointed. The picture of grilled cheese on this site looks nothing like what she got. The picture looks like a panini pressed grilled sandwich on a white type bread. She got a hamburger bun with some melted cheese on it. She said it didn't taste too bad, but wasn't what was expected. Fries were good. My burger was ok. Not the best I've had, but not the worst I've had. I will try this place again, and order something a little more exotic next time. Will update review then.",

I had the miyagi san burger and the oxtail chili fries because it was recommended by friends and yes the were both good but not great. The burgers are a little over priced and I personally think Fuku burger has more flavor. I had to give this place a 1 star due to the service that we received here. When we walked in we were not even greeted by the filipino girl who I guess was the hostess. She didnt look to happy to be there either. Our waiter was this feminine guy who wasnt to friendly either. He didnt make us feel welcomed nor did he introduce the menu to us. He asked us \"what do you to drink and what do you wanna order?\" Literally! He didnt come to check on us once we received the food but was quick to cash us out. I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone and its sad because I saw it on food network as well and was so excited to try this place.",

    "text": "My husband and I were on a date last 5/31/2014 night at the Windmill location. It took 20 minutes to get our burgers and the veggie gyoza and fries never came. When we got our burgers, I asked them to please get our appetizer (which is supposed to come before the meal) and our order of fries. Not only was it late, but it turned out neither were ever prepared. I told our server, I think her name was Ashley, to cancel the veggie gyoza appetizer, and she rushed to the kitchen I assume to communicate it to the cook. 5 minutes later, someone from the kitchen came out with them wrapped in a to-go box. I had to repeat that I already cancelled that order. (Another communication breakdown or  one that didn't happen?) At this point I was exasperated. My husband who had already finished his burger, was still waiting for his fries (dessert?). I asked him if he still wanted it after a server said: \"two minutes.\" He looked so disgusted that I just asked them to cancel the order. The manager came out with repeated empty apologies, but didn't offer to make it right. If you're a manager and you want your patrons to come back, shouldn't you try to make it right???!!! Instead of offering to comp one of our drinks, she continued to repeat her apologies. THESE EMPTY and REPEATED APOLOGIES irritated me. I'm from Hawaii and so are the owners. There is something called customer service, but I expected more of a Kama'aina service here. People are human and mistakes are made, but make it right. Their mistake in our order irritated me, but it happens. HOWEVER, their failure to make it right is downright disgusting and offending.",

I believe one of the managers was off duty (one of the friends was joking and said can I speak to your manager and the manager stood in front of him, joking around) and had friends there, the waiter and the one pregnant waitress were all  shooting the breeze with each other and didnt even notice we were there. Needless to say, after the 40 minutes of waiting we left. Would have loved to try the food, but the service or employees just werent around, i guess they didnt care that a easliy over $100 order and tip didnt matter to them as long as they got to talk to their friends.

This place is small and kind of unpretentious (yay!).  If it were closer to my house, I would go here all the time.  My BF and I met an out-of-town friend here for dinner, as she was shopping at the nearby outlet mall.  Since we don't live that close, we decided to try EVERYTHING.  We started off with the Momato appetizer (Japanese tomatoes with balsamic and fresh cheese).  I think I remember seeing in a review that these weren't worth your time.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  These tomatoes were the perfect flavor without a hint of bitterness.  The ratio of each ingredient was perfect too.  Loved it.  We also had cold edamame beans which were just okay.  My BF ordered the Ronin Burger.  My friend and I ordered the Kiki Burger.  My burger was soooo good.  Cooked perfectly and great flavors.  My BF tried mine and swears his was even better, but since I didn't get a bite before he woofed it down, I wouldn't know.    As for the fries, we split an order of the Truflle fries and the garlic and salt fries.  I loved the garlic fries, truffle fries weren't my bag, but the other two enjoyed them.   Somehow, after eating all that food, we decided to order two desserts: strawberry beignets (basically crunchy strawberry filled donuts) and peach poptarts.  Don't bother.   Both desserts were mediocre and definitely the weakest link in this otherwise awesome dinner.  Even though this is out of the way for me, I will definitely be going back.  Our server (whose name has escaped me, mostly because he looked and sounded like Keanu Reeves and even said he was from Hawaii, but I'm sure his name is not Keanu) was great as well.  You could tell he was really trying and was very attentive.  And did I mention the prices????  All that food plus a Sapporo and our bill was $60!!! Beats the heck out of Grind Burger any day, which is VERY overpriced IMO.",

We decided to make a trip in tonight with the kiddos and left completely disappointed by the service and quality. First, my burger came out missing the onion rings and the avacado was on the side. The server said he would bring the onion rings out which I found odd as that meant I was then going to have to build the burger for them. Okay, no big deal. Then we get our salt and pepper garlic fries. We began eating them to find a small hair. I pulled it out and we kept on eating. It happens and understand you cant completely avoid these accidents and have never had an issue before. We then ran into another hair so we decided to say something. The manager came over, apologized and offered another order which we agreed. We finished off dinner to receive our check ...... it included the fries. The $4.00 hairy fries. Seriously?! I don't like to speak up in restaurants as it makes me uncomfortable but this situation warranted it. But you are seriously going to turn around and charge me the measly $4.00?! Now THAT is just gross. We wont be back. Don't think the charge was worth losing business forever.",

The staff is friendly and can offer decent recommendations.    I ordered the Kiki's burger, truffle fries, and the Japanese tomatoes w/mozzarella appetizer.  The burger was delicious, definitely recommend if you like mushrooms.  The patty was cooked to perfection and the bacon added that last kick to make the burger perfect.    The fries were definitely good but could have used more truffle sauce and I don't recommend getting the tomato appetizer unless you feel like spending some extra dough on a nicely presented unique appetizer.  Only downfall i would say is that you end up spending around 20 bucks on a burger with fries and drink, but that price sure beats burger bar.",

I love skinny fries and they even sprinkled it with a bit of chopped jalapenos.   I can see why this place is busy. My only complaint is that it's a little pricey and the food takes time to come out.

Kitchens get busy, especially all at once seating on a busy lunch. I support you guys. If you had the time to sit there and watch your clock, 12:45, 12:52, 12:56 then pre order your food. It's a busy place, small and cozy, and yes you'll wait. Its the name of the game.   If you wanted it fast, go to McDonalds next time. I'm sure you'll walk in at 12:30, and be out 12:32.

I will say that the beef they use has great flavor. The Chicken and Turkey burger that I tired however, just didn't sit well with me. It was way to over spiced. The burgers here are overpriced for what they are. The downer is that your burger doesn't even come with fries, you have to purchase them separately. Unfortunately, the order of fries was so small, that it was gone in no time between two people. I also ordered a large Sapporo and sadly it came in this small glass, but they sure charged me for a large. The atmosphere of this place was not to inviting either. Nothing to catch your eye, no music, no TV. The only thing that was worth looking at was a tall and handsome waiter that works there. Sad to say that I will most likely not come back to this place for a burger as they are overpriced and the atmosphere was not inviting.",

I can't stop raving about the food to this day! If you go to Vegas, go out of your way off the strip and go to Bachi Burger.

But, it was truly love at first bite.   Got the Kiki because it was recommended by my fellow Yelpers (thanks guys!)  The bun was nice fluffy and sweet (like Hawaiian bread). Loved the dipping sauce that came with it! Burger itself had a hint of sweetness and I'm assuming it's from the carmelized onions. Bacon, mushrooms, lettuce, carmelized onions, and of course a tender patty nestled in a bun of perfection!   Second time my table ordered:   Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11.50 - I could only really allow myself to have a few bites from this. Definitely massive enough to feed at least 3-4 people for an appetizer. Topped with a sunny side up egg and mixed in with chilli and bits of oxtail pieces. It was okay..definitely a good hearty app for the boys, but I probably wouldn't take the initiative to order it again.   Pork Belly Buns $10-  Comes with three. Buns were nice, soft, and fluffy, and pork belly was cooked perfectly with a sweet glaze and topped with raddish and parts of a boiled egg. Definitely yummy and filling but I don't know how I feel about it being $10.   Manga Burger $13 (?) - Their specialty burger with scallops and crab? It was ...satisfactory..definitely not memorable enough for me to go into extensive details about it. Honestly, I enjoyed the Kiki a little more but my friend enjoyed the Manga because of it's unique flavor. Just get both, lol!",

Our server gave us some suggestions since this was our first time. We were tempted to order ramen but figured we could get that at home so we opted to get burgers.  We liked the salt n pepper fries and calamari, not so much the takoyaki balls. All of our burgers were delicious! We had the Ronin, Black and Green, Miyagi-san, and Spicy Miso. Mine was too much for me after eating the appetizers and fries, so I took half back to the hotel and had it for a snack later that night.  Service was really good, too. If we're back in area, we'll definitely come back!",

We ordered a variety of stuff to try - bachi pickles, oxtail chili cheese fries, edamame with truffle oil and garlic, truffle parmesan fries, salt & pepper garlic fries, shogun burger, miyagi-san's wagyu burger, banh mi burger, and ramen.  Everything was just super delicious!  The wagyu burgers were juicy and the ramen broth was very flavorful.  The next time we're in Las Vegas, this is definitely on our list of places to hit up.",

Simple decor and nice ambiance. clean.  So first off I order the Taro Boba. Now, I am a total fan of the Taro Boba drink back in southern Cali but their verison of the this drink was not for me. I took a sip and it was over. I felt bad that the waitress had to take it away but I'm not going to sit there and pretend to enjoy it. I'll just stick to the ones I know back in Long Beach/Orange county.   Anyhow, as for as the burger I decided to try a specialty of theirs. The \"Banh-mi\" burger (I think that how it was spelled...don't remember). I have to say that this burger was flavorful and simple. Not your average ketchup burger either. It had this asian twist to it with the picked carrots on the side and a side of which I think is a light fish sauce dipping sauce.   As for the fries there were about 4-5 opinions to choose from I picked the Truffle Parmesan Fries. Comes in the silver ice cream cone looking thing. the truffles on top of the fries were interesting and has the consistency of cooked mushrooms. Over all I enjoyed it...it's nice to steer away from something you're use to once in awhile.  I had to knock off one star because of the Taro Boba drink. awful. Good place to eat but not to drink taro boba's.",

    "text": "As my first official yelp review, Bachi Burger definitely earns the privilege of being the \"first\"!   We went for to Bachi Burger during the lunch rush house madness however I only waited about less than 10 minutes to get seated. I went ahead and ordered for my bf as he always gets a usual burger (ketchup and mustard only) regardless of where he is eating. I ordered a protein style medium well with avocado burger.   I would hands down say this has been the best protein burger I've ever had. I was a bit skeptical about order a protein burger as I didn't not maybe reviews on me. But I was definitely not disappointed. Great Asian infused flavor. I also ordered the aioli fries and he got regular fries. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> ! My bf was very satisfied with his \"plain\" burger, and he's definitely the pickier one. He always a says that a \"good burger doesn't need so many ingredients\". He even filled out the survey!   Overall great place. It might be a bit more pricier, but you get what you pay for! Did I mention that they automatically gave us military discount without asking. (He came in uniform) from work. Good customer service and great food! Must try :)",

They were soggy and cold. Wouldn't order them again.  Sticky buns with pork. Meat was good. Size of the plate was small compared to the price. Side sauce was yummy. Not bad but not worth the price.  Fish burger. Extremely soggy bun due to sauce on fish. Fish was tasty and flaky but the soft bread made it impossible to enjoy as burger. I decided to eat the fish without the bread and couldn't enjoy the condiments it came with. Keep in mind none of the burgers include fries! You must order them separately.  Bachi burger with onion rings. Maybe the best thing we ordered except the meat fell apart. First bite made the past crumble and made it tough to eat. The overall taste was enjoyable but not fun to eat. Just messy.  Alcoholic beverage. They have a special blend of drinks unique to their theme. The puree was bland and did not have a fair portion of alcohol. It was obvious that the waitress didn't have bar experience.  Thai tea. Didn't meet the mark. I have this at least twice a week at home and it didn't even meet minimal taste.   Service. She did get best to provide us with a great experience. That's why I'm giving it a 4 star and not 3! The genuine interest to get things done with a smile and a professional attitude made the dinner worth the stay. I can't blame the server for the food but I can blame the server for the great service! She really tried make it fun for us!  I recommend this place because overall I think there's a good concept and if they work on quality of food and their consistancy of flavors as much as they do on service they will be a hit place!   I will give it some time before I go back but I will return for a second Chance!",

I also really enjoy the oxtail chili cheese fries and order them every time I go. This is one of my go-to places to bring friends visiting from out of town and everyone has loved it.

I had a spicy miso something and it was delicious. I usually go with the burger but if u like ramen try it out.

We get drinks and some water, begin to settle in when we're placing our orders and he tells me that actually the bun isn't vegan and something else. It was VERY nice that he went to check, don't get me wrong but it was just a bit frustrating that now we have this cocktail to pay for, have already opened silverware and stuff and now we have to walk out bc there is literally nothing I can eat there. I'm not sure why in Yelp (or I think on the menu) it said there are vegan options because there aren't. IT was all around awkward and a bummer bc we made a special trip.",

We sat there a lot longer than we should've before being greeted. The server came, and asked if it was our first time, and we said 'yes'.

    "text": "This place is as trendy and hipster as a burger place can get. For wait times, I usually come in on weekend nights and I'm almost immediately seated.  The waiters are top notch, they have good knowledge of their food, what's the best selling, refills on water, and the normal checking up.  I usually order the ronin burger. It has angus beef, caramelized onions, japanese cole slaw, mis goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, and yuzu citrus aioli aka just a bomb selection of ingredients. I've tried most of their menu but I feel like this is probably one of the best ones. Taking a bite out it the  yolk immediately oozes out and creates a secondary spreading on the burger making it even more juicy ^^. . This burger was definitely a 5/5.  And with any of their orders I always get their truffle parmesan fries, it is always consistent and I never had a bad batch of fries from them. Fries are also a 5/5. Not too greasy, and has the right amount of parmesan.  If I could change anything about the food is I wish they could give more sauce! It last only half the meal, and the charge for more :/ .   If you're anywhere in Vegas, I definitely recommend this place!",

I've never had my meal come before my appetizers...weird. I was an expediter for several restaurants and I can tell you that's NOT how it's done. My water was dropped off 20 minutes after we were seated and never filled again. First time at this location, and I will NEVER be back. Too bad because the one in summerlin is really good. I feel really bad for the owners. Their staff clearly does not care at all. Perhaps it's better on a different night but we came on a Tuesday afternoon and it was not busy and the service was still terrible. A room full of people agrees.",

It was probably one of the best burgers I've eaten. The prices aren't too bad either; the burgers have an average price of $14. Our food came out fairly fast, but the only downfall was that our server was not knowledgable and did not take care of us that well. We asked him for his opinion on one of the seasonal burgers and he did not give us adequate information. Also, our table was so messy he did not even offer to clear up our dirty plates. Despite this, the food was superb and I'm definitely coming back to try something new!",

Peking Duck bun- Basically a fancy Siopao but i thoroughly enjoyed all 3 bites :p unlike me, if you can refrain yourself from stuffing the whole thing in your mouth, you deserve a cookie. so good, i couldn't help it! I have to come back to try the pork belly bun.   Kalbi burger- Medium Rare. High Quality meat that melts in your mouth. (i didnt even know meat could do that?!) The kimchi was a little over powering.

The burgers are nuts-- the Bahn Mi and Kalbi burgers are my favorites.  Haven't tried the \"wagyu and foie gras\" burger yet.  OK, here comes the maybe-not-so-good stuff.  It's kind of a strip mall feeling.  Because it's in a strip mall.  And... the meat isn't the best burger meat I've ever had.  Kind of tastes frozen... or just CAFO-beefy.  Not bad, but not particularly beefy. They definitely focus on dressing up the average burger meat well.    But, they do that.  The burgers are great, and the beer selection's particularly good for Las Vegas, where most places seem hell-bent on serving Lite Beer or Blue Moon and that's all.  Worth a drive and a bit of a search to find if you're anywhere near there.",

Our waitress, Melissa, welcomed my group with big warm smile and explained menu items in detail since we let her know it was our first visit. We probably waited more than 20 mins for our food. However, its well WORTH the wait!! After my first bite of spicy miso burger, it made me want to sing at the table... yes it was just that good!! Angus beef was cooked perfectly. The medium cooked patty was very juicy and tender. I enjoyed the balance flavors between Japanese shishito peppers, egg and Angus beef. My salivary glands kick in overdrive when I tried to picture that burger and write this review. I also sampled Kiki's burger and Bachi house salad. They both tasted pretty awesome. I liked my Spicy Miso burger better. I was pretty impressed with their house salad. It came with pretty good portion and had mixed greens, avocado, walnuts and yuzu orange vinaigrette in it. This place has Truely won 5 stars in my Yelp book with its mouthwatering food, friendly price and supreme customer services. I will be back very soon to try Shogun Burger (wagyu beef, unagi, pan seared miso foie gras, poached Asian pear, yuzu butter and yamamomo peach)",

The girlfriend go the Kalbi Burger which was \"Ground Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, House Made Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo.\" AWESOME.

    "text": "before you bite my head off, I gave it a 3 based on texture issues and that's a huge thing for me when it comes to food. Ambiance, service & flavor are a 4 but I couldn't get past the texture of the overall burger. Okay. Here we go.   We wanted to try this place after returning from Los Angeles and eating an Umami burger. From some of the yelp reviews this place seems to be a rising star with the exception of the service. I'm happy to say that they took our reviews into account and service is great. Now for the review.  I wanted a great burger, something different in town besides the usual burger joints. After reading about this place, despite service issues, I needed to try it for myself.  My husband and I headed down and we were seated as we approached the front counter. They need a \"please wait to be seated\" sign because the layout makes one assume that it's a place where you order at the counter. Anyway, we were seated by this adorable waitress and our drink orders were taken immediately.  The menu is simple and unique from any other burger place here. We decided on chili fried chicken appetizer, 2 kiki burgers, one truffle fries and one garlic, and 1 honeydew boba shake. The appetizer was good but luke warm making me assume it sat at the window for a moment. The flavors were really good but the plate wasn't what I expected. It's small boneless nuggets, not wings like I assumed. Still tasted great. The fries and burgers didn't take more than ten minutes and were nicely plated. All the aoilis were great. I was hoping that the aoli was made to order but I think it was made in a large batch. Still it was good and the one served with the truffle fries was so good that we ordered another side of it. As everyone says, all seasoned dries need more seasoning because it's not penetrating the fries but sitting as a sprinkle on top after being put in the cones.   as for the burger, the flavors are right on but here's the kicker-the texture needs work.  Here's what I mean. When you have the caramelized onions, soft greens, soft mushrooms and bacon and then the burger has a pate-like texture, it's slightly off putting. (see my cut open pic). I can see where some feel that the burger is too mushy, because it's texture is super soft rather than having that firmness that burgers have. Despite this, I enjoyed the flavor profile. Nicely done. For those who enjoy the meat flavor in their burgers, places like this aren't for you. This place is about turning other foods into burger form.  I would eat here again but I hope they try to add more textures into their burger. Try a cheese twill instead of sliced cheese to give it a change from the mush and softness of the burger and toppings. Other than that I liked it. The honeydew boba was nice, too.  You should give it a try for something unique. This place is about the experience, and you'll get a good one.",

Crab & scallops on the usual burger, pretty good. Had Ronin burger the 1st time. Staff's attentiveness is up & down but overall good. Have they finally solved the sewage odor problem?",

The fries, which are also a fusion kinda thing, are also very tasty. I highly recommend them.  There are a few salads. They are good, but it took forever to get the  order to the table and the portion was not that large for the price and time it took.  Then there is the usual drinks plus boba drinks. Good, but pricey.  All in all, I like Bachi Burger. It is a little slow, a little pricey, and not everything on the menu is worth ordering. But, it is a unique place, clean, friendly, and the food tastes great.  I'll go back till I try everything at least once.",

Several other tables that arrived after the two of us, got their burgers before we did.  Tried flagging the waitress down but she seemed to be avoiding eye contact.   Ronin burger was good, sauce was a bit sweet but creative combination. BF had the Black and green burger, he thought the blue cheese dominated the burger but I liked it.  Loved the buns, soft and light.  Ordered the truffle parmesan fries and garlic salt and pepper fries, loved them both.  Great menu, will be back to try the other burgers.",

My shogun burger was disappointing because the patty was overcooked but the foie gras slab was generous and delicious. They offered to redo my burger but I didn't want them to have to redo a $25 burger so I declined. Later, since I couldn't eat the meat, I wish I had taken them up on their offer. Service is kind of spotty but the facility itself is hip and clean. Worth a try for sure!",

The fries have amazing sauce added to them and the brussel sprouts were chopped in smaller pieces with a great sauce on them as well. The only things I would change, would be offering up a pretzel bun option and using fresh cut fries. Other than that the food is pretty amazing. Service was ok. Parking was like regular strip mall parking. The price was fair and I would return.",

I can't pin-point which one is my favorite because they are all different (lies, its the Miyagi Sans burger but, I didn't want to hurt the others feelings). All I can say is that when you add an egg to a burger, it intensifies the flavors of the burger with the burst of the egg yolk. ::drools::: I can't say I am a fan of the oxtail fries OR the truffle fries but, the burger is enough to fill you up and doesn't really need extras as its the STAR of the show.   Try the vietnamese coffee to finish your meal but, order it half way through your burger, as it takes a bit to brew. A nice mix of condensed milk and flavorful coffee.",

    "text": "I have been coming to Bachi Burger since they first opened on Windmill. My wife and I have always enjoyed perfectly prepared meals and excellent customer service and we absolutely loved the food. Yesterday we took a group of friends from out of town to lunch at Bachi Burger and it was not a good experience.   We were a group of 12 and had made a reservation for 1 pm. We were seated and had our drink and meal orders in by about 1:20 pm. We were seated on the Ramen side and it appears we were out of sight out, out of mind. We sat for 45 minutes without being even checked on by our waitress. Our fries were brought out at that time. In an hour we were checked on once and had our water filled once. It was at least another 45 minutes before our burgers were brought out. One of the men in our group left without eating because he had been away from work for two hours and had to return. Over two hours passed before we were finally served our food. The food was not up to its usual high standard. The egg on the burgers had hard cooked yolk. It has always been cooked medium with runny yolk which adds to the deliciousness of the burger. I had told everyone in our party how great the food was and it wasn't up to the normal high standards. The service was the worst. When the waitress was asked about the two hour wait for food, she said they can't control the time and gave other excuses. When asked why we were never informed of the extended time to get food she had no answer and was defensive. She did apologize but it was not genuine and I truly believe she didn't care. This is not the standard I have come to expect from Bachi Burger and I am extremely disappointed. Bachi Burger has always been my favorite restaurant and that is how I characterized it to my friends. I feel let down. Our bill was over $200 and there was no consideration given on the bill in spite of the serious issues we experienced. This experience has tarnished my formerly high opinion of Bach Burger and I will seriously question whether I will ever return. Disappointed doesn't even come close.",

I mean we understand that there's other table to tend to but it was not that busy for anyone to come check is we needed anything else.... I was fine with that but when I ordered tonkatsu ramen Togo, I was excited to get home to it. As I opened the box, there was no meat. No tonkatsu. My ramen tasted like crap without it. It was such a disappointment that I was even thinking about posting this but I did. I'm upset that my ramen didn't look like how my boyfriends ramen did when he had it at the restaurant",

The bun was so hard I had problems biting into it, but after 5 or so minutes the juices from the burger softened them up. My complaint was the lack of service. We ordered our drinks and food at the same time because it took awhile for the server to come over.  The server dropped off my water and had the host bring my boyfriend's tea. Then we didn't see him until 5 minutes after we got our food. We had to ask the host for refills. It was also upsetting to see a server sweeping the floors and cleaning, not wash their hands, and then grab plates to bring to our table and another table.  Also as we were done and looking for the server we got to hear someone that works there tell a different server to ask her table if they were going to get dessert and that everyone needed to cash out NOW.  No worries we hurried out as soon as we could find our server, and the burgers were not good enough to overcome the poor service so we wouldn't go back.",

So, I never would come here when Brad T. would suggest it until one day, Im like \"what the hell, why not?\"  & Lo and behold!! I have fallen in love with this burger joint.  Was I imagining how great this burger (Miyagi-san's Grass Fed WagyuBurger) was! DELISH! We also ordered the: Salt & PepperGarlic French Fries & the Truffle ParmesanFries.  The truffle fries & you dip it into the sauce that goes with it.  It is absolute heaven, never tasted a fry that is so addicting (besides Mcds fries, lol) I can eat probably two orders of the truffle fries.   The service was superb, he was very friendly and recommended some things that we should try out next time we were there.  The ONLY reason why, I took away a star because I ordered Thai tea & coffee ice cream.  The thai tea was completely watered down, it tasted horrible. The coffee ice cream cost about $2.99 (I believe) it was soo tiny!   However, I would definitely come back here but I probably would never order the thai tea or ice cream again.",

    "text": "I think that a big downfall for a lot of places is when there is a lot of hype and it than sets very high expectations- exactly what happened for me. We got lunch on sunday afternoon in a group of 5 and waited maybe about 45 minutes for our table so not too crazy. So glad to be sat down and given cold waters haha we all ooh'd and aah'd over the menu. Everything on there sounds darn near perfect! Such an unique play on flavors, I love Asian fusion. Sadly, I don't think it was executed as well as it could have been though.    Truffle Parmesan Fries: the fries themselves were good, pretty skinny and crispy which is how we like them. However, you can't even taste the truffle on them and the porcini cream sauce on top wasn't too great. They serve a chili garlic aioli on the side that was tasty though. Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: generous portion for the 5 of us to have shared. The first few bites were DELICIOUS! The more it cooled down, the sweeter it got so we weren't a fan of that. I was thinking there would be kind of chunky pieces of oxtail meat but it was in tiny shreds so im not sure I really got that flavor profile.  Miyagi-San burger: Wagyu burger with chili mayo, fried egg, FURIKAKE, crispy onion strings, and CARAMELIZED BACON. Sounds heavenly right? All the flavors complimented each other perfectly especially since I added gruyere. I did finds myself wishing I had also added some arugula to cut through some of the richness. My complaint about the burger would have to be that I had ordered it medium rare and it came out pretty well do- burnt on the edges well done. Our server had been pretty attentive prior but hadn't come back around so I just ended up eating half my burger and getting full...  Other than that, the Taro bun that one of the burgers came on was great! My friend got the Shogun which has unagi, pan seared foie gras, etc and he felt that It didn't taste like it was worth the $26 it was. The pineapple iced tea was addicting but there aren't free refills so savor it if you don't want to pay for another round! I woulddd come back but don't think I'd go out of my way to eat here.",

But I have to say that Bachi burger is the real deal. Normally food like burgers and fries are very heavy and make you get the Itus aka food coma. Buf after eating here I felt light and refreshed. The food is a nice play on Asian fusion burgers and fries so if you're familiar with Asian food you'll get the subtle nature of how the flavors come together. (hats off to the chef because there are some very cleaver combinations).  The staff was friendly and we were seated right away. I know this place is off the strip, but at 4pm it was packed. So if you want to try this place go around the 2pmish time. My friend and I came here at 3:30 pm and there was a 20 minute wait so we opted to go to the bar.  No less than 30 minutes later there was a line at the entrance and people waiting outside. The burgers here are an excellent value and the Foie gras burger was on par pricing wise compared to the one I had on the strip ($28 range) the other burgers are ala cart and were around $8-12 depending on what you want in it.   I had the spicy miso burger and that was definitely a knife and fork burger (or lots of napkin burger). The burger was cooked to perfection. I really like the Taiwanese bun it was something different than what the normal burger joint has.   So all you Vegas ppl  if you rent a car I suggest that you go out here and try it.  If you don't like it and are in vegas when I am I'll buy you lunch somewhere else*  * Note: participant must be in vegas the same time as me and must not like bachi burger. (sorry I don't go to vegas that much lol...)",

    "text": "I'll have the miyagi, please; the burger, not the person. That'd be weird.   When you walk in, it appears to be your average strip mall, Vegas-born burger lounge. But, looks can be deceiving...I mean, haven't you ever looked at a photo of a Big Mac compared to the real thing?   Burgers are made to order, or you can choose among their expertly crafted selection of gourmet options. The miyagi (if you can't tell) was my poison of choice, and goodness gracious was it worth it. Truffle fries reign at the top of their game, and sit alongside so many different french fries options. But, keep in mind they don't come with your order unless requested. So, request it.   Also, speaking of miyagi, did I mention that they have ramen? Noodle house/burger joint. Super random concept; brilliant execution.   Portions are pretty generous, so before you think you can tackle the American/Asian food breed easily--maybe, you should reconsider and back down. Pricing is pleasantly reasonable for gourmet burgers, and definitely won't break the bank in order to stuff yourself.   Wax on, wax off, Bachi Burger, and keep on fighting with good tastes.",

My friends and I ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, pork belly sliders and Chicken nuggets thing for our starters. The pork belly sliders we could've done without but the other two, were freaken tasty as hell! The fries were tasty to another level, The chicken nuggets things were so good, I pretty much ate the whole plate by myself.   I ordered the Ronin burger which had all kinds of delicious on it! It had an egg, cole slaw, onions and all kinds of other stuff that I can't remember! It was too good. Everyone should come here and eat here!!!",

Ive ventured and tried other burgers.like the Bahn Mi and the one with Bleu Cheese, both very good, but for own taste buds its all about the Miyagi. Also.tried the Ox tail chili fries...its chili fries, but made with shredded oxtail which tastes like beef.  You'd never know the difference. My favorite appetizer is the Japanese sausage.  Definitely worth trying. Get those!  Oh yeah, last visit grossed me out. Our server was wearing jean that looked like they hadn't been washed for months.  Looked more like a mechanic than.a.server. I mean it was gross he was serving us food! Go shower and wash your clothes! Management! Ask you people to look clean please...even the people next to us were saying how dirty the staff looked..because it wasn't just our server.",

We come here every few months and yes it's always busy, yes there's always a wait but yes, it is always worth it!!   The Ronin, Miyagi and Kiki are my favorites. I have a hard time swaying from those three but I'm sure one day I'll venture outside the triangle because I know I'll never be disappointed with the food here. The buns are perfection, the meat is always tender juicy and full of savory flavors and the toppings are outrageously good and the creativeness of each one is what makes these burgers my number one in Vegas. I can't get enough of this place. Along with the burgers order yourself not one, but 2 orders of oxtail fries because once you try them you'll want a full serving  to yourself! Basically chili cheese fries on steroids of meaty goodness.   The donuts are also amazing!   We will most definitely be back!",

The menu offers a good variety of options and concepts that most might not have experienced before but did not come to a surprise for us. We ordered the Oxtail chili cheese fries and a medium Mr. Ho's burger recommended from most  reviews. The burger had a great flavor profile especially the unique taro bun that complements everything nicely. The oxtail fries were a bit overhyped. The portions were more than enough for 2 ppl however, fries and chili cheese did not taste so great. We didn't get much oxtail considering the size of the plate and tasted mostly beans than anything. The egg is a nice touch though. Service was good for the most part and finding parking shouldn't be a problem. The menu is a bit overpriced especially for a burger and steamed buns.  Tip: Does the place offer a great concept of tradition to modern in their food? Yes. Worth the price? Not so much... especially if the quality of taste was subpar and if you're craving for a burger, I would recommend looking eslewhere.",

It was nice to go off the strip and explore some of the other great food places Vegas has to offer. There are two locations for Bachi Burger, one on Windmill Lane and one on Sahara Ave. We came on a Monday for lunch. Good thing we got there early before the lunch crowd packed the place.  I'm a big fan of burgers and loved the idea of an Asian fusion burger. I ordered the miso burger and split the truffle parmesan fries. Ken L. ordered the Mr. Ho burger and a glass of their Plantation Sweet Tea.   The truffle parmesan fries were really tasty and addicting. The plantation sweet tea was refreshing, had a hint of mint flavor, and was not too sweet.I really enjoyed the flavors of my miso burger. The burger was juicy, the buns were nicely grilled, and the veggies in the burger were fresh. I also enjoyed the taro bun on the Mr. Ho burger.   I would say the star of the burgers is actually the Taiwanese style buns. They are freshly made made locally in a Chinatown bakery and to the restaurants specifications. They are slightly sweet but super light.   Note: I hear they are going to open up a location in Southern California.",

They have a very appealing menu with lots of unique ingredients in their food, which is what I like.  Our server was on point. He always made sure we had waters and clearing our table of finished dishes.  Truffle Fries $5 These fries were good but not the best i've had. We couldn't really taste the truffle all that much, but it was cool because it was also topped with truffle sauce and extra dipping spicy garlic sauce on the side.  Oxtail Chili Fries $11 These fries were good as well. It was a very large portion and was the perfect sharing size for my group. The chili was a bit too sweet for my taste though. And I wasn't exactly sure how much oxtail was in there because it was super mixed up. Probably like tiny skinny shreds of oxtail. But I would still recommend it.  Miyagi San Burger $15 I got my burger cooked medium rare and it was perfect. Pink on the inside and brown on the outside. Overall the burger was simple but delicious.  Plantation Style Iced Tea $4 A bit pricey for tea but it was well worth it!!!! Delicious pineapple tasting tea. Must try!!  I found out after my meal that they had taro buns!!! Definitely getting that next time!  Overall it was good and i would still love to come back and try more of their menu items!",

    "text": "To ALL burger buffs, meat hounds, Asian flavor fanatics, diner devotees and to just-plain ol' hungry human beings:  I dedicate this experience to you all!  It all started one cold Saturday evening in February 2014 when the bf and I decided to pop our Bachi Burger cherry. Wait time: 25-30 minutes. Though medium-to-large groups lingered in and around the restaurant, these groups were diminishing at a pretty impressive pace. Names were being called from left to right. It didn't take long until the hostess finally said what I've been yearning to hear for the past half hour...\"Rachel.\"  Once seated, the menus eagerly flipped open and the bf and I were enticed to such great heights. The selection of starters and burgers were bountiful but after careful consideration the lucky winners went as followed:  Ox-tail chili cheese fries: This appetizer should be a REQUIREMENT when dining here. A large, hot plate stacked with crispy thin fries immersed in generous amounts of salty and savory chili, shredded ox-tail AND crowned with a perfectly fried egg--tell me what's not to like? This portion is perfect for 2 adults with a tenacious appetite.  Kiki burger (my choice): I knew this burger was calling to me when I first read caramelized bacon and sweet onion marmalade. The words 'caramelized' and 'sweet' being the major deal breakers. Unfortunately, that's where the courtship between Kiki and I comes to an end. Though the meat patty excelled in juiciness and the bacon maintained its candied glaze, it fell short elsewhere. I was underwhelmed by the not-so-sweet-non-existent-taste-of-onion marmalade and the slight bitterness of the greens. But it wasn't a total fail for my appetite. Like a short-lived romance with an ex--we shared some good moments and also some bad--but in the end, I never really saw any great potential. Kiki just wasn't meant for me.  Ronin burger (the bf's choice): Any burger with a fried egg is pretty much en route to the bf's belly. There's no way he's going to let it slip on by. The only problem with this burger was that it was HIS and not mine. We cut both our burgers in half and traded so we could sample each others but deep-down inside as soon as I sunk my teeth into this burger I was hooked. Ronin grabbed a hold of my taste buds and never wanted to let go. It was love at first bite. So many wonderful things were happening in my mouth that made it nearly impossible to ingest. An orchestra of flavors and textures that was beautifully executing a rhapsody. I wanted to salvage the juiciness of the meat, the sweetness of the caramelized onions, the tang and crunch of the coleslaw and even the saltiness of the fried egg. Bravo Ronin. Bravo!  If my experience doesn't make you want to feed the beast then you're completely and utterly missing out. Bachi Burger is a MUST try when in Vegas. Their Asian-fusion/Asian-inspired take on the classical American burger is pure genius.  Don't believe me? Then just listen to what your inner soul is saying because I'm pretty sure it sounds something like this...  GO. TO. BACHI BURGER.  NOW!",

Whoever thought furikake and beef goes well deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. SERIOUSLY. Grassfed beef, crispy onion rings, OMG bacon,chili mayo and that fried egg combined with a toasty bun makes this place an automatic 5 stars.   True to following Yelp, we ordered the Oxtail Fries and the Truffle Parmesan. Man, those fries are so good with and without the sauces, and while I preferred the classic tastes of the Truffle Parmesan, the hearty flavor combined with the delicious chili cheese makes the Oxtail a must get!  The Sake Sangria is not a bad choice for those who want to get their pre-buzz on but actually enjoy the burger and not collapse while eating it! A combination of Sake and Sangria works pretty well, and while I only had one, I think next time I'll try both styles and see which one is better!  There are so many reviews of this amazing place, and I believe if they continue to strive towards perfecting their burgers, they're unstoppable! You deserve the 5 stars Bachi Burger!",

Apples and oranges, I know, but this was one of the best damn burgers I've had...ever.   First off, the entire menu looks amazing. Every single burger. Every single everything. After seriously analyzing every menu item, I eventually figured I couldn't go wrong with any of them, and opted for the Kalbi. Holy flavor bomb...seriously amazing. The bun was perfectly toasty, the sauce was so flavorful, the patty was perfectly cooked, and the texture and flavor combo was spot on.   I visit Las Vegas annually for business, and I will ABSOLUTELY make a point to come back next time I'm in town so I can try something else. But...um...maybe they could open a Denver location? For me? Please? Franchise, maybe? PLEASE?!?!?",

The server got us our waters and took our order immediately. My girlfriend ordered the Kiki and I got the Miyagi san burger. We also ordered the truffle fries. Food came pretty quick and the quality was good. The reason why I give this place a 4 star rating is because service is pretty slow after they take your order. They tend to forget about you after you're eating and don't bother checking up on you if you need anything else or more water. Had to ask more than 3 times for water refills. Also had to remind them for my check. I do remember other instances were service was a little better, but not amazing. Overall it isn't a bad place come eat if you enjoy burgers. Oh! Before I forget avg price per burger seems to be around $10-$16",

    "text": "My family and I loved Bachi Burger before, for the great food and service. Unfortunately, both have been lacking the last couple times we've been here. We were a party of 5 and came in during dinner rush on Sunday. Our server was nice, but our drink/food runner had much better service skills and was more attentive than our server was.  The drinks came out quickly (thanks to the awesome food runner, these two stars are for you). We ordered 2 types of fries and the Japanese Sausages as appetizers. Those came out in a timely manner. The sausages were disappointing, as they are not the same and too greasy.  Our server might've forgotten us, because he took our order much later. We ordered 3 burgers and 2 salads with chicken well done.  This is where the experience really goes downhill. 2 other tables received their burgers before we did, and they were sat much later than our table. Our burgers finally arrived, but the salads had not. By this time, the place had cleared of the dinner rush.  We waited a little longer, and half our table was almost finished with their meal. I got up to speak with the manager and cancel one of the salads.  Since when does a salad take longer to prep than the burgers? I understand we ordered the chicken well done, but salads normally come out first regardless. As I talk to the manager, the salads arrive. One was sent back because that person in my party lost her appetite with the long wait. The manager said the food took longer because of the well done chicken request. We didn't order a well done thick piece of steak that takes much longer cook time. A small piece of chicken doesn't take that long to cook well done.   I was not pleased with his response to default to our preference as the cause of the issue. The manager was kind, he offered to take the cancelled salad off the bill, and said he would box the salad up to-go. I was satisfied with that, until the manager dropped the bill off with a quick, \"sorry for the inconvenience\" and forgot the to-go salad he promised... We paid the bill and made our getaway, it wasn't worth bringing up.  The restaurant's severe lack of kitchen and food order management needs to be addressed. You have fresh ingredients and things take a little longer to cook, I understood that as a frequent guest of your restaurant. But the way this was handled was insincere, and mediocre at best. This will be the last time I bring anyone here.",

    "text": "Two things are guaranteed in life when entering Bachi Burger 1) Ordering Oxtail Fries 2) Ordering an amazing burger. My friend recently moved down to Vegas and started creating all these foodie spots that she really liked. When I came down to visit her, bachi burger was the first place we ate at. I went during lunch hour so there was no wait for us. It was a party of three. I looked at the menu and my friend right away ordered the oxtail fries while we were looking at the whole menu. Oxtail fries are a MUST. The hype is real and you'll see as you try it out yourself. The egg on top of the fries was perfection alongside the oxtail. Amazing combination. For my burger, I got the miyagi-San burger which is the BEST burger I've ever tasted in my life. I've eaten at a lot of burger spots and nothing beats this. It was Cooked to perfection and there was so much flavor to it. I savored every bite before it was all gone. If you love burgers or just want a great spot to eat at then try this place out. You're not going to lose. Thanks Bachi Burger!",

    "text": "Used to love coming to Bachi Burger. However it seems that as they expand the quality has gone down. Bachi is a place we've brought 10+ different groups of people visiting town to because it was worth it. 2 months ago we ate here and the food was meh. Truffle fries were undercooked, buns burnt and they forgot all the sauces on our burgers.   Last week I took my parents there because they had just moved here and it's close to them. While we appreciate friendly servers, having your employee stand at our table and proceed to talk the entire time was not necessary. Nor was it necessary for him to come back and continue his drivel while we had mouthfuls of food and wanted to have our own conversation. Now let's get to the food.   We all ordered our burgers Med or Med Rare. They were all brought to us well done and the paltry grey color of frozen meat patties that by health code rules cannot be cooked below medium well. Again our burgers had no sauces and our truffle fries that showed up 10 minutes after we got our burgers were woefully undercooked.   Do. Better. Bachi Burger",

    "text": "The wait can be ridiculous but  I always get VIP treatment and not have to wait EVER. Unlimited iced matcha green tea and cherry yuzu soda, FTW! They have specials: crab dip and manga burger. Some make it to the regular menu, some don't. My faves include: shogun burger, miyagi san burger, Kiki's burger, steamed buns (pork belly or duck), sausage and truffle parmesan fries.  Shogun Burger: Wagyu Beef, unagi, foie gras, poached Asian pear,  miso butter  and Yamamomo peach on the side. It's very rich and fatty but oh, so delicious! It's worth the $26! 5/5  Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns/ Pork Belly Steamed Buns:  Duck Breast, cilantro, scallions,  radish,  boiled egg, Hoisin BBQ sauce. The buns are fluffy and the duck skin is nice and crisp, the duck meat is tender and juicy. Pork Belly is fatty good. 5/5  Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage: Sausages with a side of honey mustard. A great appetizer. 5/5  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: With garlic aioli  and fried egg on top. The chili itself is a bit sweet for my taste. Not my favorite thing on their menu but it's still good and worth a try. 4/5  Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries: Sprinkled with Maui onion sea salt  and garlic chili aioli on the side. The dipping sauce is good, the fries are ok. 3/5  Truffle Parmesan Fries: Parmesan Reggiano,  black truffle cream with sun-dried tomato aioli on the side. This is one of my favorite fries in Vegas/Henderson. Very tasty! 5/5  Ronin Burger: Angus beef with caramelized onions, coleslaw,  miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ and  yuzu aioli. Refreshing because of the yuzu and rich beacause of the egg. 5/5  Kiki's Burger: Angus Beef  with sauteed mushrooms, caramelized bacon, onion marmalade,  Gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli.  Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger: Wagyu beef with chili mayo,  fried egg,  furikake, caramelized bacon,  fried onion rings. This and the Shogun burger are the best burgers on their menu. It's a thich burger so you have to cut it in half and press it down just so it would fit in your mouth. 5/5",

I tried calling to inform them about my son getting I'll but the phone just rang so two days later when my son was well enough to be left alone I went into the restaurant to advise them of my sons illness and wanted to know if anyone else was sick. The manager was a young kid that obviously had little experience. He said he had not heard of anyone getting sick. Then when I asked why the don't pick up there phone he said it's broken. He offered no refund (I had my receipt) nor did he ask how my son was feeling. Nothing but a blank look on his face. I walked out and will never go back.  DQ offers better food and deals!",

    "text": "Tried this place in June when I came to visit Vegas for a weekend of fun. I was embarking into an awesome food traveling that time around, since all the times I went to Vegas, all I did was party. I found out about this place through Diners, Drive-ins &Dives. Yes, I can watch that all day long. Dont judge. Im a fatty :) Anyway, enough with the intro...  Wait was about an hour. It was PACKED. I was guessing it was THAT good, that every Las Vegas partier came here for hangover cure. It was a pain in the butt having to wait outside knowing that it was 1000 degrees outside. Waiting area of the restaurant was tiny, but I managed to squeezed in.  Food: Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries- My yelper people were absolutely right about this one. YUM YUM YUM YUM! I would order it again in a heart beat. It was meaty, fries were crispy &flavorful.  Pork Buns: It was like the asian tacos. Sweet pork flavor, in a soft fluffy white asian buns. Delicious!   Shogun Burger- Had foie gras, unagi &wagyu beef. This burger was okay, but definitely NOT worth $26. Maybe it was because I am not a big fan of foie gras(duck liver), because of the gamey taste, &the burger is a little on the sweeter side. Unagi made the burger a little fishy, but the wagyu beef was good.   Banh Mi Burger- Awesome rendition of the Bahn Mi Sandwich. I definitely recommend.  Service: It was okay. Waitress couldve been a lil more friendly, but she was preggers from what I remember so I understand that her job could probably be a lil stressful.   I cannot wait to travel back to Vegas &try other dishes at this place.",

Everything from the eggplant to the tofu to the mushroom patty was on point.  A really great combination of flavors.  I would definitely come back here, just to order this particular burger again.

The fries were big enough to share and were done just how I like them, crispy but not too crunchy.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because they showed 5 or 6 different beers both on the menu and a chalkboard on the wall, but disappointingly only had 1 type on tap.  No reason was given to us as to why.  A variety of drinks from wine to beer were available.  Service was nice and quick.  Well worth the trip away from The Strip in Vegas.  Will definitely visit here again.",

The funny thing was only one of us actually ordered a burger, but the ox tail chili fries, which were featured was really good.  Definitely a must.  I got the spicy chicken with some rice and onion rings.  The onion rings were amazing.  I could have easily have eaten another order, by myself.  Also a must.  The chicken was good as well.  It hit the spot for me that day.  My friends each ordered the buns, one with duck one with pork belly.   The burger looked good and my friend said that it was pretty good.  I also got a milk tea with boba.  They seemed to have merged with the Ramen place next door (which is how i was able to get some rice with my chicken) so there were items on the menu that were not something you would expect at a burger place.  We were there on a Friday at lunch time and we did wait for a bit.  There were quite a few people waiting in front of us for a weekday.  Once we were seated, service was great.",

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries are one of those creations that are made to blow your minds away. You take one bite and your eyes will light up. You eat that oxtail and you can't even tell it is even ox. It just melts away in your mouth. If you saw all of us eating this dish you would think we were a pack of wild animals. In a blink of an eye it was all gone. It was just that good.  I tried the Ronin and the Kiki's Burger and they were excellent! There is so much going on with each burger. Each one gives unique flavors in every bite. You get something sweet, something salty, bitter, citrus, soft, crunchy... savor every bite because once it is gone you'll be wanting more.  My friends got the Shogun Burger and he wouldn't share it with anyone. It was worth $25 so I can understand why, but man I wish I had a chance to taste that perfect looking burger. Guess I know what to get when I come back.",

Oh my gosh. It was absolutely on point. Very satisfying meal and definitely want to come back here. Be prepared to wait in line though! But it's DEFINITELY worth the wait!!",

Not once did we see our waitress. Not to mention the young Caucasian male host asked a few table around us if they  needed anything not once stopping by to ask us until my husband flagged him down to ask for a refill. There were many workers around just not helping like I said the only one was the pregnant lady. That's sad! We also ordered the Black and Green burger I believe that's what it's called and it was bland also they forgot to put one of the main Ingredients \"blue cheese\". So we asked worker since we never saw our waitress and his response was what would you like me to do. Uhh? Why do we need to answer that when yiu guys messed up on our order. Anyways he brought us two sides of it and the burger just sucked having to add your own ingredients when it should come already with it. In my opinion I would stop by the other locations and hope they have better customer service and make their customers feel welcome cause we didnt at this location.  I will NOT return here!",

    "text": "Finally stopped by Bachi Burger to experience everything people have raved to me about. Everything started out great - assorted pickles, oxtail chili cheese fries with a fried egg on top, truffle Parmesan sweet potato fries with pineapple ketchup. Our server seemed to be having a rough day as she messed up our order several times and forgot to bring a coffee we ordered after asking about it on 4 separate occasions. I decided to go with the Shogun Burger ($26) which is Bachi's premium burger: wagyu beef prepared medium, foie gras, unagi, Asian pear and arugala. Something didn't taste right from the beginning but our server never even came by to ask how everything was and seemed way too busy to even want to bother her despite the fact we were sitting at the bar right in front of her. About halfway through the burger I deconstructed it to find out what was wrong and I realized the beef was the issue: over cooked, dry and completely flavorless. I spoke to the manager who came to the table in a very unpleasant manner and said she would take care of it. Upon returning she informed us that she had kindly removed 10% from the entire bill which sounded great but turned out to be $7 - $7 off of a $26 dry and flavorless burger. I told her it would not suffice and she informed me that since I had eaten half of the burger, that 10% is all she could do. She offered to make a new burger for FULL PRICE and I told her that is completely inappropriate. After she went back and showed my burger to the chef who was arguing with her in plain sight which allowed me to see and hear everything he was saying, he told her to comp the burger in disgust. She brought the bill back, threw it down in front of us and walked away without saying a word. I'm not saying this is a typical day at Bachi Burger but it was absolutely disgusting behavior. The burger was just bad. The meat was flavorless and the patty was about as thick as a Burger King Whopper patty - definitely not $26 restaurant quality, especially since the other burger that was ordered was a thick and juicy correctly prepared and very flavorful patty. To top it all off, the bathroom was a complete mess with what looked like food or possibly some human excrement ground into the floor: I nearly vomited at the sight. Despite all of this, I would not expect to have the same experience again and would give the place another shot and I would recommend it to others because there are so many options on the menu.  In the end, they handled the bill correctly and comped the burger but they are completely ill prepared for handling these situations. Our server seemed so overwhelmed and busy that she was completely inattentive but was very kind and compassionate and apologized repeatedly for the quality of the food. A patron shouldn't have to argue their case for a $26 Burger - you're a restaurant, own up to your mistake and take care of it. A happy restaurant brings happy patrons who spend more and write great reviews.",

THAT, or I'm not leaving until I get my Bachi fix!  It's SO WORTH the trip away from the busy strip of Vegas. I've always loved Asian fusion burgers mainly because of the execution of pairing Western ideas and concepts with Asian sauces and marinate. I love the Ronin and Banh Mi burger; both had distinctive flavors but was not overwhelming! The burgers had key ingredients that were so proportionate and was just perfect with the moist patties and soft baked buns. I also tried their oxtail fries; yay for the topped fried egg. What isnt better with a fried egg?!  I wish Bachi expanded to Norcal. It would be a HUGE hit! Until then, I'll have to order two burgers each visit in order to try all their burgers. I said it Bachi -- you guys are worth the calories. I'd get fat for ya.   Bachi Faithful! :P",

It was my first time ever eating here and with all the praise that I've heard from this place, I had high expectations.   It was Saturday lunch time and it was expected to be busy. It was a 40 minute wait but it wasn't too bad--I just wish that they would have additional seating other than the 8 they had inside the restaurant. However, this doesn't affect my review; more seats would have been nice.  We were seated in and everything was so loud and fast-paced. Our server wasn't very good at listening to our orders however, but it was probably due to the loud noises (even though we practically yelled our orders). The server was also a bit irritating because when one of us wanted to get the burger cooked well-done, she asked if we wanted all the orders to come together since preparing a burger well-done would take a while and we said it was fine but she insisted on bringing the orders out as soon as they're done. We had to reassure her like 3 times that we wanted them out at the same time.   I ordered the Ronin and it was very delicious, however I tried the Miyagi my boyfriend ordered and it was even better, but to me it wasn't THAT great like everyone said it to be. Same with their truffle fries--quite delicious, but nothing too special.  Despite its deliciousness, I didn't think of it as being amazing as others think it is. I would come whenever I get the chance again, but it's nothing crave-worthy for me to come back ASAP.",

    "text": "Premium burgers with lots of fixings at affordable prices makes this place a Vegas must-try!  After hearing so much about Bachi Burger from fellow Honolulu Yelpers, I added this to my list of Must-Try's when visiting Las Vegas.  I've heard that the restaurant's owner originated from Hawaii(?), hence the menu's Asian and local influence.  Upon setting foot in the restaurant, I noticed that majority of the patrons were Asian.  Not to be stereotypical, but it seemed like a good sign to me as a fellow Asian...haha  Most of the burgers are very affordable, in the $10 range, though I did see a $25 burger which came with foie gras to justify its price tag.  The downside is that all burgers don't come with fries, which we had to order separately for about $4 per order.  I think what makes these burgers so awesome is the unique variety of toppings/fixings you get on your burger:  I got the KIKI'S BURGER which is an Angus beef burger with sauteed shiitake, enoki and eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli.  Supposed to be a popular choice.  As a mushroom lover, this burger was pretty bomb.  Not the best burger I've ever had in my life, but definitely up there!  The burger was juicy and the toppings were delicious and offered a variety of textures and flavors!   And the bun was heavenly soft yet still with enough substance to guarantee proper bun to fillings proportions.  My only complaint is that the burger was cooked in that sweet onion marmalade which was tasty, but a bit too sweet for me...  KIKI'S BURGER - $10 - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>  My BF got the MIYAGI-SAN BURGER which is a grass fed wagyu beef burger with a fried egg, bacon, crispy onion rings, chili mayo, and furikake.  Also supposedly a very popular choice.  He really REALLY liked his burger.  I didn't get to try it myself since I was getting way too full from my own burger and fries, but it definitely looked like a burger any man (or woman) would love!  MIYAGI-SAN BURGER - $10 - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#aMTZaqmcmkR_sifO0NEgtg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>  We also got sweet potato fries and the parmesan truffle fries to share.  The truffle fries were pretty good but the cheese made it a little soggy.  The sweet potato fries were also very good, but didn't justify the price tag for me.  SWEET POTATO FRIES - $4.50 - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#qcyiyggpwYcyI4XJdNihiQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>  PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES - $4 - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#7erf_MxA6MMN-ueKQkzcUg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>  Service was just okay, though I may be influenced because a bowl of ranch sauce bounced off the floor and some of the sauce got all over my legs, shorts, and in my BF's eye when the waitress was taking away our plates.  Obviously not her fault, but she could have been a little more accommodating about it...  Bottom line, delicious burgers with unique ingredients and flavors!",

Our food came out quickly as well. I had the kikis burger and my husband had the spicy miso burger. The burgers were a bit over cooked for medium but still very flavorful. All the staff was great and the manager even checked on us. The service was a breath of fresh air compared to most places in Vegas! A definite must for burgers!!!",

I have the blu burger and they just over kill it with too much blu cheese. I love blu cheese but there is a line. I have had another burger that I added garlic to it. If a vampire was within 200 feet of me he would have died after one bite. Once you scrape off the excess it's pretty bomb. The actual restaurant the tables are pretty uncomfortable. They are all just flat wood. No cushion or anything. At first it's like ok I can dig it because it's different but once you have been sitting a few mins you are like this isn't comfortable at all. Add some cushions or something. Jeesh. For amount you are paying it should be 100% on point.",

I had the Kiki burger & added a fried egg. The bun was sooooo tender and buttery, the cheese was melted perfectly, the egg was just right, the meat ( cooked medium) was soooooo good. And the service was stellar. The entire staff was so nice and helpful. It took me a while to figure out what I wanted ( everything sounded tooo good) and they were so helpful and patient with my fermale indecisiveness.  If you are craving an amazing burger w the best quality ingredients and original topping selection, this is your place! I will most certainly be back on my next cheat day to try the steamed buns and another burger =)",

I've always had quality service when I've been there and the food has been top notched. If you're a True foodie, you need to try this place out. It's a different take on burgers and other american classics so be prepared. I feel you have to have an open mindset when coming in here. I think that people who have given poor quality reviews have not necessarily understood how fusion cuisine works and that's OK! It's been a trending place and I see whether it's the burgers, oxtail fries and even the Shoku menu will continue to grow and succeed.",

In my opinion, it was nothing to write home about. It was good, but it wasn't...noteworthy. I've had better specialty/boutique (whatever you want to call it) burgers at the same price, and cheaper.  There was a pretty long line when we got there, which to me should denote an amazing experience. When we were eventually seated, the restaurant wasn't seated to capacity, but was fairly busy.  After ordering our food, we waited a minimum of 30 minutes to get the food. I lost track of time...it felt like an eternity. We had also ordered an appetizer which arrived at the same time as our burgers did (which to me was not okay). We asked our server about 20 minutes into waiting where our food was and he said it was coming right up.   The food here is 3-4 star quality, but the service was 2 star.   Would I recommend this place to others? Maybe.  Would I come back here myself? Maybe.",

    "text": "So we tried Bachi Burger finally, and I have to say that the burgers are tasty, but a little over-priced for what it is.  The buns are delectable, and the meat definitely is a higher grade of meat, but overall the a-la-carte pricing makes you wonder about your pocket book compared to other burger joints.  Definitely a great idea made off of the Asian fusion with burgers though.   It probably doesn't help that the to-go isn't packaged as nicely as say... Chilis and thus you feel that the to-go crowd doesn't get quite the same service as those inside the restaurant.  You'll run about $15 a person or so without drinks.  Burgers are $7-15, and if you want fries, another $3-6.   My suggestion?  Always get medium to medium rare. The well-done wasn't done all the way through (some pink) and it looked like they charred some of the outside which meant the heat was too great to cook the insides before the outside burned.  Don't get me wrong, it's great food, but getting it to-go found a less than heartening experience considering.",

Ultimately, I realllly want to like this spot since it's so close to my crib & the burgers are actually great, but there are just a few too many hiccups every time I visit. Firm 3 stars for Bachi.",

We started with the oxtail chili cheese fries, truffle fries and onion rings! OMG! delicious! I swear the best truffle fries I have ever had cause they glazed the top with the oil too!   I had the Kalbi burger and the fam had the miso, black and green, and the bahn mi burger my burger was korean bbq goodness, with the kimchi and everything! A must try! I had a bite of all the burgers on the table and was not disappointed. Ended with the lava cake for dessert and that also was delish! order it when you order the burgers as it take about 20-25 min to make =)  definitely cannot wait to try the other locations (since they have different menus)  Loveee this place!",

I knew about this place prior to it being on the show, but for whatever reason, I never ate here until this month. Not sure why it was featured because it's not a diner, drive-in, or dive.  In any case, I saw the oxtail chili cheese fries featured on the show and chose that for my lunch. My favorite Filipino food is my mom's kare-kare, so I'm definitely a fan of oxtail. The dish was heavy on the fries and the oxtail was sparse. The fried egg on top was a nice touch that gave some nice creaminess to the dish. The flavor was good and I enjoyed the concept, but for $11.50 I really expected more.",

The actual patty tasted fresh and one of the best I've had.  It wasn't too dry, and the flavors were a great mix! There were bits of red bean & walnuts tucked inside the patty as well.  The patty was paired with fried eggplant, fried tofu, fresh greens and lemon aioli. The bun itself was so fluffy & light!",

I didn't have a problem with doing that until the last time I ordered.. When I got there.. My credit card number was stapled to my bag and it was out in the open for all to see!! I cancelled that credit card because anyone could have gotten my card number!! Made me very uncomfortable",

Started with *Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11.5 (With Garlic Aioli ,Fried Egg) [5 of 5] - Wasn't expecting much from putting stewed oxtail over fries. I was so surprised how delicious the oxtail was. I under-estimated how different and tasty this dish was. The oxtail actually had really nice heat flavor and by far, one of the best chili fries dishes ever.  Finished with *The \"Banh-Mi\" Burger $9 (Angus Beef ,Pork ,Shrimp ,Lemongrass,Pork Pate ,Fresh Herbs ,Curry Aioli,Pickled Vegetables ,Nuoc Mam Sauce) [5 of 5] - Wasn't expecting this to taste so good, but blown away at how well all the meat flavors blended so well. And dipping the burger into their housemade fish sauce, took it to another level.  This place can brag about their burgers all they want, because it is all that. I think this is probably the best and most creative tasting burger places by far.",

Today we were there for my wife's birthday and it took over one hour for our burgers. Others were served before us as well and they arrived after us. Three times we were told the food was going to be out in two minutes even though we never asked nor complained. The third two minute statement we timed it for fun and it was 22 minutes before hey came back to tell us our food would be cooked next.   I advised the managers that on the forth time and after almost 1.5  hours  that this was disappointing as we were celebrating my wife's birthday. They did say ' for what it is worth, Happy Birthday'. I think they were genuine.   Food came out past the 1.5 hour mark and my wife's burger was medium rare instead of well done and they heated it up instead of a new one due to time. By then, my wife was not happy, the burger fell apart and was not tasty. She ate a bite and took the kids and left. I waited for the check. The team at Bachi was nice to not charge for her messes up burger.   Unfortunately when they are too busy or when they make errors they do not know how to properly take ownership and control the situation. It got worse and worse and spoiled a celebration.    So this is still a great place with quality staff and food. They just need to get to a first class five star by dealing with adversity instead positively rather than matter of fact like.   They did nothing really wrong. Just when it got bad, they were ill equipped to shine.   4 star but 5 star food.",

Would definitely have liked some sort of green or something lighter to balance out the other heavy flavors. The first few bites were quite good, then it just got too heavy for me.  Boyfriend got the Korean BBQ burger; that one was much better!  I loved the gochu jang aioli! Great flavor balance.  We also ordered the kurobata sausage appetizer... it was good, but it's like Asian lil smokies. Nothing too special.  The donut holes dessert were hard as a rock and not worth getting at all.  All of the above plus 2 drinks = $60 lunch (post-tip). I am very curious about the banh mi burger and i would go back just to try that one.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews, what would stop you from heading down to bachi burger and seeing what all the hype is about?  But no no it's no hype. The food is actually, in my opinion delicious! We started with the oxtail fries, because after so many reviews about it and on top of that who doesn't love oxtail! Seeing the pictures made me want to dive in. Of course I took a picture myself. It was a perfect balance of crunchy from the fries and softness of the oxtail meet that was laid on top and the egg is perfect to balance out all the flavors. I'm not much of a heat fan so I just dismissed the jalapenos. Btw, this order is pretty big. It was perfect for my friend and I and then some but it was just the two of us so the more the merrier.  Then we ordered the Kiki burger, medium. It was nice and warm when it came out and we took our pictures for Instagram of course. Then we both dove in. The bun was nice and soft and it was toasted on the inside. Veggies looked like a spring mix and that sauce on the side had hints of citrus and sweetness that made the burger even more delicious.   Reason for the 4 stars being that the service was not great. I felt like we were being rushed and it took forever to get a refill on our water, I guess it was because it was getting a little busy but that doesn't mean that you start being rude to your customers, even if the food is great. You'll eventually lose people that way or we'll end up going to another location. But the food is the real star of the show. I wouldn't go to this location again, I'd rather go to the other location even if it's further.",

    "text": "Wow. I'm so glad I saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. It is delicious! The burgers are piled high with really quality ingredients, but be prepared to wait. Ever since this place has been on tv, people flock to it. Also, if you're staying on the LV strip, taking a cab here will cost you about $20.  We started with the Chili Fried Chicken. It was perfectly fried, without too much excess batter, and the sauce was spicy, salty, and a little sweet. You could definitely taste the garlic. The cabbage that came with our appetizer also gave it some good texture to contrast the relatively soft chicken. Two thumbs up.  I ordered Kiki's burger, and my fiance ordered the \"Banh-Mi\" burger with a fried egg on top. When we saw everyone else's burgers come out, we assumed we'd be full after an appetizer and a burger. We were right. Anyway, the Kiki's burger melted in my mouth, and I really enjoyed a new take on a bacon-mushroom cheesburger. My fiance's Banh-Mi burger was so interesting! You could actually taste the shrimp in the patty, which also contained beef and pork. The herbs and pickled vegetables were tasty, but be careful, because the aioli and the sauce together can get very spicy.   Our waitress was very friendly, as was the young man who refilled our waters. They each said, \"please, thank you, yes ma'am, yes sir, etc.,\" and they were very helpful anytime we had a question about the menu. Overall, a great place to eat.",

Angus beef, sauteed shiitake, enoki, and eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, Gruyere cheese, and a garlic chili aioli. I also added some grilled shishito peppers which gave the burger a nice heat. The burger patty itself had a light and sweet BBQ marinade to it. Overall, one of the best burgers I've ever had.

    "text": "Get your sh*t together, Bachi Burger. It seems like every time I dine here there is some policy that has changed.   One day you could get onion rings as a side, the next it's a hard no even though they still make them to put on the burgers. Today, the yuzu citrus aioli that has always been served with the Ronin Burger has to be requested and is a $0.50 charge even though the menu still indicates that the burger is served with it.   The burgers are still delicious (thankfully), but if you don't ask for your fries crispy they will show up soggy and damn near raw.   It's so disappointing that a restaurant that serves a consistently good burger cannot be as consistent with their service. The lack of service and consistency in menu policies really drives my business away and I find it difficult to recommend this place to others.",

I'm way bummed, aside from Monta this is our very favorite restaurant. It's grandparents day at my 12 year old school, I took her out early to bring her to her favorite requested restaurant Bachi with my two teens and my mom.  Just got news they are closing right now. They just opened at 11 and they are closing their doors right now.  My heart hurts for this place, I LOVE THIS PLACE, big big bummer!  We are hangry! We ordered at 11:20 and it's 11:55 still no good seen.  This waitress is magical!",

I would probably say my favorite is the shotgun burger, it has Asian pear and foie gras! So so delish!  Also make sure you order their truffle fries!   As for the appetizers the must haves are the sticky buns and ox tail chili cheese fries! So delish!   This restaurant is also linked to a ramen place which is also very good! Try the burgers first then the ramen!  The service is really good. I think the waiting room is a bit small so we always just wait outside. I would suggest not going during rush hour otherwise the wait will be over an hour.   The also serve alcohol so that's a plus!",

Once we noticed the party next to us get seated, served AND finish their meal, that was it. My family & I walked out and we'll NEVER go back.

    "text": "I had been raving about this place to my hubby for the past month and finally got him here earlier this week. I did have to take them down from a 5/5 to a 4/5 due to a repeat burger being less impressive and so-so service.  Last time I came my party ordered the oxtail chili fries, but it was too spicy for my tastes. So this time we went with the truffle fries. They were awesome fries, but I can't say they screamed truffle. Next time I would either get those sweet potato fries again or try the salt and pepper fries.   Hubby and I both ordered one of burger specials - he got the lamb burger I'd absolutely raved about and I tried a burger that's served on a bed of risotto. Unfortunately, that lamb burger just didn't hit the second time. My hubby flat out hated it. I thought that was strange because of how much I enjoyed it on my first visit. I took a bite - while it wasn't as awful as he led me to believe, I had to agree that it just wasn't doing it for me. The red sauce on top is pretty darn sweet - overly sweet, which is not his thing. I usually enjoy sweet on my burger, but I like for something like a sharp cheese to help balance it. When we finally managed to wave down our waiter, we expressed our disappointment and asked if we could swap out our burger (which only had two small bites taken out of the huge patty) for another (more expensive) burger. But our waiter informed us that wasn't an option - all he could do was charge us for a new burger. Hmmm....  Thank goodness the burger I ordered was not only awesome, but huge enough to share. As I mentioned before, this burger sat on top of a bed of risotto. It was then topped with fried onions, siracha bacon jam and two fried eggs. The risotto was cooked perfectly and had a simple parmesan flavor. The fried onion rings were skinny cut and crunchy - just the way I like them. And the bacon jam was chunky and delicious!  I definitely want to go back to this place and try to confirm the 5/5 rating that I originally gave it.",

    "text": "Hubby and I decided to finally try this place out after friends from California begged us to eat here with them. I was honestly disappointed because I was expecting a lot from this placed based off of the hype surrounding it. It was alright.. definitely not worth the $120 bill it came out to be.   Appetizers: Bone marrow Duck steam buns Oxtail fries  Entree: Loco Moco burger   I enjoyed the loco moco burger a lot, the risotto was amazing and everything blended well with each other. The bone marrow was alright, I feel like the toppings overwhelmed the natural fatty taste of the bone marrow so it just ended up tasting like toppings... None of us really liked the oxtail fries because it ended up tasting like regular chili Fries without any elevations.. I was the most disappointed with the duck steam buns; the were very chewy and hard to eat, I choked on it and couldn't even get a clean bite through.. I've never had duck with that consistency before and using a knife to cut through was still VERY difficult.   Overall, I gave this place a 3 star because it was mediocre. The server was nice and kept checking back in with us. I feel like the idea of a fusion Asian burger place is awesome but they could've done better with ththis execution of Some of the items on the menu. I did however like their apple lychee Italian style soda and the loco moco burger  I would probably explore other burgers next time I go here, but I am in no rush to eat here again.",

You can't go wrong ordering any of their burgers, however my personal favorite is the sho gun burger with wagyu beef, foie grad, unagi, poached pears. Their beef is high quality and your can taste the difference. Their truffle fries with porcini cream sauce are to die for, and their oxtail chili cheese fries a hit with anyone I bring here, and I love their calamari. Their presentation and quality is very consistent and I am always happy with the service. They also offer freshly made milkshakes, adult milkshakes, and a variety of other fun beverages. If that wasn't enough they also offer ramen. My favorite ramen dish is the tan tan man. Packed full of flavor and has a nice kick but not too spicy.",

It was so hard to decide what to get (so make sure you go with friends so you can each get something different and share). I decided to get a burger and my boyfriend got their spicy miso ramen with extra noodles and pork. I forgot which burger I have gotten but it was huge! It was delicious though. It had fried onion rings inside, bacon, and an egg! It was juicy and had the right flavoring.   My boyfriend's ramen was also delicious. It was even more so because the weather outside was cold. They charge you $1/$2 for extra noodles, and they aren't kidding about it when they mean extra. They give you a lot. We had so much left over, even after sharing it between the two of us. Their bowls only come in one size. The soup was delicious. It wasn't too spicy, therefore we added more chili oil, chili powder, and whatever spices we could find. They had the option of making it extra spicy, but we didn't want to risk it on our trip.   We also ordered a milk shake. I highly recommend you do. I got their strawberry guava milk shake and it was perfect with my burger. I didn't know how strawberry and guava would work out, but it does. It's rich and creamy. Each flavor was not too strong. We also ordered their oxtail fries as an appetizer. It was a good size plate filled with fries, melted cheese, beans, and other various stuff on it. It was good, I just wished it came out sooner. The fries came out like a few minutes before our food came out. By that time, we ended up not finishing the fries, barely touched it, because we were so full off of our own food.   The overall pricing is not bad, it's about $12-$18 per burger or ramen, dep",

    "text": "Bachi Burger CURIOUS. I've been wanting to try Bachi for the past two years and never tried it until now finally. Marking it off my list makes me want more.. The unique twist on the menu caught my eye and the flavor combinations are enlightening. I came by last night for dinner and the wait time was decent, not too long maybe about 15 minutes or so. The inside is very clean, modern and at the same time casual and trendy. They offer a wide array of burger selections and even have a menu for those who prefer ramen. The server was very attentive and the service here is excellent!  DRINK: Red Sangria   FOOD:  -PORK BELLY STEAMED BUNS -OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES  -MIYAGI-SAN'S BURGER   The Sangria was very excellent as it was very fruity, lush, and boozy.   The fries were on the top of my bucket list to try here. It was fun to try and tasty at the same time, but pretty much like chili cheese fries.. could have had more oxtail meat with it (you know what I mean carne asada fry lovers?!)   I recommend the pork belly steamed buns, they were savory and took the first few bites without the sauce it was fine both ways.   As for the burger (wagyu beef , chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings).. it was very satisfying and has everything I crave thus matching my taste buds quite well. It was definitely full of so many flavors and cooked just how I wanted it (medium well). To be honest I was stuffed though from my appetizers, so I only ate a small fraction of it. The next day this burger still tasted great.. as I ate it as leftovers for lunch today.    Come here for a wide variety of asian fusion inspired eats and find a special drink to enhance each bite!~",

I am a burger person, and I will give this place 5 WORTHY stars! The atmosphere is sleek, service is awesome, food is excellent, what more can you ask for?!  Goal is to try every burger on their menu! 3 down, the rest to go! Try the ramen out too, its b.o.m.b",

The music is loud and thumping but you forget that the minute your food comes. I had the Miyagi-San and my husband had the Ronin. We thought we'd each have half of each burger but that didn't happen.  After the first bite you have to sit back and breathe, they are so good!  WOWOWOWOW!  Fabulously tender and so many wonderful flavors. We will go there every time we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "*drools*  Absolutely loved this place! Came here once while in Vegas and I'm so glad we came here. We were staying on the strip, but we had a rental car, so we drove here.  I ordered the black and green burger with salt and pepper garlic fries and momotaro soda.  The burger: Absolutely delicious and very very filing. The patty was pretty thick and had a lot of flavor in it. What made it really filling were the mushroom, bacon, and blue cheese. When you throw all of this, it makes for a really great burger, but do make sure to try it while on an empty stomach!  Fries: The fries was very good. Crispy and had the right amount of flavourings. However, do make sure to share it because the portion is meant to be shared.  Momotaro soda: First time I've tried peach and strawberry soda. I tasted a lot of peach, but not a lot of strawberry, but I'm not complaining.  Price and value: For burgers, they're pretty expensive at first glance, but once you factor in the stuff they put in, it makes sense and the quality of the ingredients are high, so I'm not complaining.",

Rumor has it the place was feature on \"diners, drive-in, n dives\" (I'm sure I got the name of the show with Guy F. wrong)... I will only review what my hubby and I had and experienced. Service - 5/5. since we were one of the early arrivers: ordered, ate, and paid the tab all within 45 min Fries with truffle and aioli sauce - 5/5. damn, it's good and fresh off the fryer. Sweet bun with roast duck and sauce - 4/5. it was only good.  I had better at authentic Chinese restaurants. Shogun burger (my other half's breakfast of the day) - 10/5. YES, 10/5!!! IT WAS THAT DAMN GOOD.  I was only lucky to stole a bite out of the shogun while my hubby was bz with his phone researching our next destination of the day. The $25 shogun is worth every penny! It is worth a trip back to this place just for the burger.  Vietnamese ice coffee - 4/5. Usually when I'm hungry, everything should be better, but this didn't do it.  Overall, because of the shogun burger and the estimated mean, I gave it all the stars it deserve.  If the joint opens one up in northern Cali with the same or higher standard, I would never dine there, instead I will quit my job so I can work there as many days as I can to eat the mouth watering burger daily;",

We came back 45 minutes later and found out a different lady was working and had skipped us. When asked she made it aware to us she skipped us even though we were there earlier than our spoken time. The hostess that was working 2/17 between the time of 2:30-3:00pm with black glasses and nose ring was extremely rude and condescending and we then told her that we would not be eating there due to her rude energy. If you cannot serve do not be in the service industry. Sorry Bachi Burger but one rude employee can tarnish a lot. On to the one at Sahara!",

The black and green burger has bleu cheese, roasted garlic, bacon, mushrooms and spinach.  The wagyu burger has a fried egg, crispy onions, caramelized bacon, and chili mayo.  Both were awesome, but I give it to the wagyu burger.  The fried egg pushed it over the top.  Both burgers were cooked perfect.  We also ordered the salt pepper garlic fries, Truffle Parmesan fries, and sweet potato fries.  I would say the Truffle fries are best without the sun dried tomato sauce they provide and the garlic fries were best with the garlic chili sauce.  I give the garlic fries the edge as the truffle fries needed more truffle oil on them.  The sweet potato fries were good, but I am not really a fan of sweet potato fries.  If you like them, these are great.  This place is great and I would drive out of my way to get my hands on these burgers.  Bravo Bachi Burger, keep cooking!",

    "text": "I had the Ronin Burger, an order of garlic fries, and a drink  The restaurant is a nice enough dine in establishment with a good selection of drinks.  I was with a group of friends, we had ordered and ended up waiting a while for our food to arrive (roughly 10 minutes for the fries and 20 minutes for the burgers). It was a long time, but I was with company and it only made me hungrier. I think part of this was due to a large 10+ person party arriving just before us, so it was probably just bad timing, but still, it was a long time to wait after ordering our food.  The burgers are expensive, but the size and amount of toppings compensate for it. I found the Ronin burger to be extremely tasty, but unfortunately due to the sauces, the bun got soggy really quickly, so after half of it I didn't want any more and just picked at the rest of it.  My friends didn't seem to have the same problem though and they got different ones (my apologies as I don't remember what they ordered).  Overall 4/5 stars, I'm interested in coming back and trying something different. If the wait is just as bad without a huge group and a different burger ends up soggy, then I may adjust to 3/5, and if it's not the case, I'll adjust to 5/5 (as those first bites were very tasty).",

I ordered the Kalbi burger which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.   The bun was fresh, soft, and slightly sweet...but the best part was the bun to burger ration was perfect.   In no way did the bun overpower the beautifully cooked Angus burger.   The kim chee was homemade and full of spice.    The Japanese marinade gave the burger the right amount of flare needed to call it a \"BBQ burger\".  Overall, you have to try this place.   Fresh, homemade buns with a medium rare Angus beef burger that is juicy and flavorful....you can't go wrong by this place.",

We stayed, and got some drinks at the bar while we waited. First, my husband got a milkshake and thought it would be cool if they could put a shot in it. Since it WAS a bar and all. Well, the bartender obliged, but all the while telling all of his coworkers how crazy it was and weird and laughing about it. Making us feel pretty bad.  So we sit down, it's freeeeeeeeeeeezing cold inside. People are visibly shivering. We get our meal, I got the no meat burger, the consistency was so weird and mushy,it just feel apart in my hands!!( I've had plenty of '.no meat' burgers that at least had the consistency of a burger!!!!!)  The waiter was supposed to deliver us our fries with our burgers, but he comes back to our table, when we inquire about them and acts as if we NEVER ordered them!!!!!!!! He said it would be another 5 or so minutes.. By the time we would have gotten those fries my burger would have been STONE COLD!!!!! So I said forget it, lets just go....... It was an awful experience, never going again. Honestly, I felt like I was in that show \"Kitchen Nightmares\".... Get a new manager for real.  THIS PLACE IS HIGHLY OVERRATED!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "These Asian fusion flavors will make an indelible impression on any burger fan willing to branch out and try something different. In fact, many food critics say \"Bachi Burger\" might just be the best gourmet burger spot in Vegas (which is a pretty bold statement considering all the burger joints on the Strip backed by famous chefs).   Burger \"connoisseurs\" unwilling to experiment any further than some avocado or pepper jack, however, might be scared off by this menu. For instance, the Ronin Burger features Angus beef, carmelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, Miso-Goma dressing, fried egg, Katsu BBQ, and Yuzu citrus aioli. The Banh-Mi Burger includes Angus beef, pork, shrimp, lemongrass pork pate, fresh herbs, curry aioli, pickled vegetables, and Nuoc Mam sauce.  Don't be intimidated, though -- there are other options for those with simpler tastes and you can always build your own burger by starting off with an Angus patty or Wagyu patty and adding ingredients from there. Fried onion rings, applewood bacon, grilled onions, cheddar cheese, etc can all be added to any patty for $1.50 each.  There are also a variety of different sandwiches to choose from and I could honestly fill up on the fries alone. The oxtail chili cheese fries with garlic aioli and fried egg are extremely popular, but the more traditional fries are also a big hit -- mainly because of the savory sauces that accompany them. The garlic chili aioli, Yuzu citrus aioli, sundried tomato aioli and pineapple ketchup are all HIGHLY recommended for dipping or drowning the fries of your choice (the options are regular, garlic, sweet potato, and truffle Parmesan).  If you're not much of an adventurous diner, you'll probably stay away from Bachi Burger. Your taste buds will definitely be missing out, though.",

Bermuda Road, it's about a 10-minute drive from The Strip..  Atmosphere Not quite Southwestern, not quite Asian, not quite...identifiable.  Yellow walls, dark tables, dark chairs, low lighting.  A bar along the right side of the wall.  Tables and chairs are partially hidden from the front door thanks to the Asian-inspired folding screen behind the hostess stand.  There's patio seating, although it was closed because it was a little cool outside.   Service Our waitress was very friendly.  The food was a little...slow.  We ordered burgers and fries and our fries were gone (and we were eating the dipping sauces) while we waited for our burgers.  Food/Drink Of course, the burgers took a little while because they're so delicious!  No, I didn't order what Guy Fieri had; I don't eat pork.  Instead, I ordered the Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu Burger (chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, crispy onion ring).  It was absolutely amazing!  The right amount of juices dripping from the burger when you bite into it.  The soft warmness of the buns.  The right mixture of toppings on this particular burger.  I made sure to eat mine slow so I could savor it as long as possible!  The French fries are delicious!  We ordered both the Salt and Pepper fries and the Parmesan Truffle fries.   Definitely go for the Parmesan Truffle fries; it's an unique twist on an American favorite!  Dipping sauces were just perfect with them, too.   Definitely a new favorite in Las Vegas!",

It was something different to try.   I ordered the Mr. Ho's burger $9.5 and the rest of my group ordered the Kikki burger $10 and 2 Manga burgers $11. Mr. Ho's burger was good, I assume intended to have a sweet and savory balance however I think mine was more too sweet.   The bf got the Kikki burger which I really liked. He interpreted it to be like a mushroom swiss burger. If the gruyere cheese throws you then don't worry because I didn't taste it. It was yummy to me.   My friend who ordered the Manga burger Loved it. He described it as melting in your mouth flavors. I had a bite but guess I didn't take a big enough one bc I didn't have the same reaction. The bf said the bite he had was good and tasted like a big chunk of crab mixed in. Overall I think a good choice but it was the special for the day when we went.   One of our friends who wanted to try and maintain his diet ordered the Ahi tuna burger. He said it wasn't anything special. He had a better one in Austin.  I also ordered a side of the Parmesan truffle fries $4 but with the gravy on the side. Nothing spectacular. Just regular fries if you need a side with your burger.   Overall, I will be going back to try the other burgers when I'm back in Vegas. Worth the trip to go off the strip for lunch. Also we went at about 11:30 and it wasn't packed but when we left about an hour later there was a long wait so we were glad we missed the lunch rush.",

    "text": "Bachi Burger is ruining my life!! Why? Well, it's because I'm so insanely jealous that it has captivated my boyfriend's heart in a way I never will.   On our latest  trip I asked my boyfriend what his favorite part of our trip was. To give some background info, we spent a few days in Vegas, a day in Disneyland, and a couple days in beautiful Camarillo. If you had asked me which of these was my favorite part of the trip, I would've answered \"dancing with my wonderful boyfriend at a wedding\". His answer?! BACHI BURGER!!!  So apparently, Bachi Burger is better than Disneyland- the happiest place on earth. It is also better than anything we did in Vegas (including winning money). AND it is better than a couple romantic days lounging around with each other.  Fine, I suppose it's delicious, but sheesh- cut me some slack. It's not like I have a third pound of perfectly grilled wagyu on a house-crafted bun, a specialty sauce, or come with a side of truffle fries. I'm just me. Just human- not godly burger.  Anyway, the shogun is a $25 burger and it's super tasty and loaded with stuff (unagi, peach, foie gras, etc.) but i'm not sure it's worth the $25. I'd have to try it again to let you know. I really liked what I ordered, the Miso burger, but my boyfriend's Miyagi-san burger was REALLY good. So I guess I can forgive him.",

TIP: If you can't come all the way out to Vegas, they just opened one up in LA!",

    "text": "3.5 overall.  My boyfriend and I came shortly after they opened, so we definitely beat the rush and were seated upon entering!  That was a plus, as we were in and out within an hour.    I noticed quite the price increase compared to the previous yelp menu photos and their provided online menu from June 2012, so I'll list the prices for the items we ordered:  1. Truffle Parmesan fries ($5.50)- I love skinny fries! These were cooked to a slight crisp, which I definitely enjoyed.  The black truffle porcini cream provided a nice savory saltiness to the fries, but the sun-dried tomato aioli really sealed the deal.  I'm not a huge fan of sun-dried tomatoes, but this aioli rocked my socks.. I found myself spreading it on my burger throughout the meal!  2. Kiki's burger ($11.00)- I do love me some mushrooms! I found the burger to be rather bland, even with the 3 types of sauteed mushrooms, bacon, and sweet onion marmalade.  I liked that the bacon had a slight smoky flavor, which paired well with the sweet onions and mushrooms, but I didn't care much for the garlic chili aioli.  The aioli definitely just tasted like garlic chili and mayo, and I preferred spreading the sun-dried tomato aioli on this burger to amp up the flavor.  The bun totally reminded me of cha siu bao (bbq pork buns), and upon first bite, the onions and bacon really made me think it tasted just like one..Must've been my mind playing tricks on me!  3. Mr. Ho's burger ($10.00)- The taro bun was what intrigued me!  The bun was like a taro bun from a bakery- purple and sweet! Overall, I thought this burger was really sweet and saucy.  It was a bit too sweet for me and my boyfriend, though.. It might have been due to the sweet taro bun and the sweetness of the  lup cheong (Chinese sausage).  We ended up only finishing half of this burger, but oh man! The cold leftover half (which we snacked on a couple of hours later) was so good!  I assume that the flavors settled and had absorbed into the bread while the burger cooled and dried out.. That must've also helped to mellow out the overall sweetness.    The interior was nice.. An unfinished, modern, cool, and relaxed feel.. Service was good, music was loud, and they allowed guests to sit and have a drink at the bar while waiting for a table. I'm glad to have tried this place out, but based on the items I ordered this time, I think it's just ok.. I'll have to come back and try some other items.",

Don't get me wrong, the food is still delicious; however, last weekend I came by and have decided that I will not go to this location again. We got into the restaurant the same time as a large party of 7. We stood behind them as they were getting greeted by the employees. Looked like it was a server that was setting up their table. He cleaned off the table for them and put together tables to form a big one. At this point, we were still standing behind the large party. About 6 minutes later, the server sat the party. We then were able to move up closer to the \"host stand\" and waited for our turn to get seated. Nobody greeted us, nobody looked at us. The server that sat the large party kept walking pass us back and forth as he was getting the large party water and asking if they had questions on the menu (keep in mind that the large party was seated right next to the host stand, so we were for sure within sight). I kept trying to make eye contact with someone, but nobody seemed like they were paying attention to the host stand. After about another 7 minutes, someone finally saw us and said \"someone will be right with you,\" which still took another minute for a server to come greet us and seat us down.  I told the server in a polite way that we were standing there waiting for awhile, not only did he not apologize, he just said okay and walked us to a table. It seemed to me that the workers didn't really carry any customer service whatsoever. As we were eating, we also noticed the several parties that were coming in had to wait quite awhile to get someone's attention. Even though the food was really good, I will not be returning to this specific location due to the lack of customer service.",

We ordered 2 different cocktails that they were out of so we had to stick to just ice tea. After ordering our food the wait for our food was over 30 minutes really for a wedge salad. After our server took our order she was never to be seen again someone else delivered our food and we were never checked on through out our meal. After we were done with food and left parched because no one came to refill our drinks she dropped off the check. Server again was no where to be found so someone else took our payment which took another 10 mom for them to bring the card back for us to sign.

Let me preface this by saying we are from the Midwest, we are cattle people and always have a beef in the freezer, so I KNOW good quality beef. The burger smelled. I don't think the meat was bad, it tasted fine, but the smell was so overpowering, I could hardly gag it down. I'm not sure if there was an oil on the burger or what it was, but the smell of it was too much. For what it is, I thought it was overpriced, but that seems to be the norm in LV.",

The burgers have gone up in price gradually over the years, but it's still worth the price. For this visit we ordered the Kiki Burger, Miyagi-san Burger, Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, and the Pork Belly Steamed Buns.  Burgers: Both burgers were amazing. They cooked them to a perfect medium-rare. The flavors for the Miyagi-san are so good that when you break open the egg, you want to dip it in the juices on the plate. The Kiki is also good with the mushroom and onion combo.  Oxtail Fries: I don't know if you can beat chili cheese fries with and egg on top. The flavors and ingredients are perfect together. This could be an entree on it's own.  Pork Belly Buns: These are always good. The pork belly is tender and the bun is soft. The hoisin sauce is a lot tastier than normal hoisin sauce you get at a Chinese restaurant.",

If you love the idea of assorted Japanese mushrooms and a big slab of caramelized bacon on a juicy burger you've got to try the Kiki burger! I typically get mine cooked to a medium or medium rare and it is absolute PERFECTION.   Several friends have also recommended the Ronin burger so if you want that extra protein from a fried egg in your burger, the Ronin's the way to go! This one's packed with flavor from some seriously saucy katsu bbq and yuzu citrus aioli.   Personally, I actually prefer Bachi Burger over Gorden Ramsey Burger over at Planet Hollywood :P  Keep in mind that these are gourmet burgers so expect to pay $12+ for just the burger alone (fries not included).",

The burgers were okay but the fries were mind blowing. I've never had fries with so many toppings be so good! Great flavor with a bit of a spice and a over easy egg on top. The service was great, the waiter was knowledgeable of the menu and knew which burgers were best. In my opinion the burgers were pretty bland in flavor but the meat quality was good.  Try it out!!!",

It's still really good though! The salt and pepper garlic fries are the best too!   Service: 1 star; the service on a Saturday is pretty terrible. It seems like they don't have enough staff to accommodate the influx of people, but also, the workers are just not attentive, nor friendly. Of the 3 workers we dealt with, not one of them seemed happy or friendly. Maybe it was just an off day for them... We tried flagging someone down for about 8 mins and not a single worker was looking around at the customers or paying any attention to them. They were all standing with their backs to the customers which seems like a big \"no-no\" to me in the serving world, but perhaps that's just me...One person even walked by and ignored us when we tried grabbing their attention. It wasn't until I got up myself and talked to someone that we finally were able to get a server to come over to us.    Overall, I like this establishment, but I feel like they just need to step up their game in customer service. Even a little bit would go a long way!",

Good luck getting refills or sending back a plate (which you will need to do either for cook or special order- they ALWAYS make mistakes with orders) or even getting everything you ordered because they don't check on you after you get your food. We ate at the Windmill location recently after Christmas 2017 and they weren't even busy and we still experienced terrible service. It's not necessarily all the server's fault- they only had two people on the floor.  Although the food is okay, I'm done with Bachi Burger in both locations because of service.",

The service was great although there was only about 6 patrons in the restaurant. Here's the review, the \"Wagyu\" burger was good, cant say I noticed a difference in the meat beyond a normal angus burger, but ok, we'll say it's \"Wagyu\" beef, had good flavor, thanks to some sort of sweet sauce it's either cooked in or marinated in, the bun was great and the veggies fresh. Now the Just Fries, some of the worst I've ever had, period. Undercooked, limp and greasy, change your oil please.   Was hoping for a better food experience, especially since the reviews were great. So I'd ask that you start being honest with your trivia of the place, my $11 \"Wagyu\" burger wasn't as good as Red Robin's $6 burger, and I'm glad BB doesn't doesn't include all I can eat fries.",

However, the burgers are very messy and sometimes the patty will come out a little redder than what you prefer. You can always send it back if you're unhappy, but it can be an inconvenience.

Our party of 10 arrived around 11:45am. While the restaurant had a few diners already, we were told by the very rude guy up front that it would take 15-20 minutes so the staff can get caught up with orders. Totally fine except he was extremely rude about it. When we were finally seated our server was great. She took our orders and was pretty efficient.   Our food arrived and we immediately noticed that it didn't look the way it did before. Nor was the flavors the same. My beloved favorite Bachi Burger was no longer the way it was before. I was extremely disappointed.   Not only the food was a total disappointment but the whole place seemed to have been trashed! With only one restroom available, the womens, it was gross and very dirty. The owners need to invest in this place in order for this to survive long term. It is no longer the same Bachi Burger I waited hours for. It's now a place I will definitely avoid!",

The serving for the fries seems like it has gotten smaller compared to a few years ago though.   The servers were attentive and friendly. Apparently, the chef is very big on presentation so they won't cut the burger for you. However, they will give you plates and a knife for you to do it yourself. It wasn't a big deal.  Try this place out if you're looking for affordable quality burgers and chili cheese fries.",

This time around I ventured off to try the Kiki burger: Angus beef patty, sauteed mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese & garlic chili aioli.   This burger wasn't as great as the Miyagi but it still was a contender. The patty came out to be juicy. The mushrooms added an additional umami flavoring. While the bacon and onion provided the sweetness component to the meal. The cheese allowed the burger to have a creamy texture. The mixed greens was the perfect touch to tone down the saltiness of the ingredients. Yet another fantastic dining experience from Bachi. Compliments to the chef! :D",

    "text": "4.5 stars. If I didn't eat at Holsteins a couple days prior, I would probably give Bachi Burger 5 stars. But in a head to head competition between Holsteins' Rising Sun burger and BB's Ronin burger, I'd have to give the edge to the Rising Sun... but not by much.  The Ronin burger ($9 - caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ, sweet bun, yuzu citrus aioli on the side) wasn't as sweet as I was expecting, which let the savoriness of the beef shine. The other star was the onions, which provided most of the sweetness I tasted, along with the dressing and BBQ sauce. It's a messy burger after biting into the egg so prepare to use a few napkins. Even with all the ingredients it was a compact burger that held up well after each bite. There were no issues with stuff sliding out the back and falling apart, as can be the case with other burgers with a million ingredients.  One area where Bachi Burger beats Holsteins is with their fries. They're excellent and highly addictive. Truffle parmesan fries ($4) topped with parmesan reggiano, black truffle, chives, a light gravy drizzled on top and a side of sun dried tomato aioli.  They also have an interesting array of non-alcoholic drinks. The jasmine strawberry lemonade ($3.75) I tried was like 3/4 lemonade and 1/4 strawberry slushy on top. Not only was it a great looking drink, the light floral flavor mixed with fruit was incredibly refreshing.  I should have ended the meal there. Instead I ordered one of their specials... an ice cream sandwich ($4) - vanilla ice cream and house-made whipped cream between two chocolate cookies. The cookie was soft, but not soft enough. When I tried to cut into it all the ice cream and whipped cream came shooting out the back. The cookie tasted decent enough, but as a whole the dessert wasn't in the same ballpark as the rest of the meal.  Despite that dessert, this place is highly recommended. It's a great bargain when you consider going to a similar (or inferior) burger joint on the Strip will cost you an extra $10-15 more per person.",

    "text": "THE FAMOUS BACHI BURGER!  Been meaning to come here since I began my stay here in Vegas. Rumored to be the best burger and it did not disappoint. I don't know about BEST, but it did rank in the top burgers of my life.   Right off the bat, service could be a lot better. There was a wait of 3 parties in the cramped lobby of the restaurant when you could PLAINLY see that there were 5+ open tables in the back. Our waitress told us there would be a 20-25 minute wait for a table of 5. So we went to the bar in the middle of the restaurant where there were at least 4 tables that could accommodate us... Sounds like a ploy to get us to spend more money on drinks!   Well, it worked. The bar isn't the best. Drafts are a bit pricey, got a Sapporo for $5. But my friend got a well drink called \"Kambei\" that was DELICIOUS. It was minty and grapefruity and super refreshing. Highly recommend.   So as soon as we got our drinks an empty table just happened to open up! And we were seated, 10 minutes into our estimated wait time..  ANYWAY, onto the food. I ordered/tasted: The Ronin Burger, Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Ox-Tail Chili Cheese Fries, Truffle Fries, and Kalbi Burger.   Ronin Burger: SO GOOD. I ordered medium-rare and it was cooked perfectly. Really tender and juicy!    Pork Belly Steamed Buns: Not the biggest fan of pork but the meat was tender and yumz. The buns though, were awesome! Perfectly steamed.   Ox-Tail Chili Cheese Fries: These were amazing. My friends and I demolished them in 5 minutes. Meat melted in your mouth and the runny yolk of the fried egg made the dish.   Truffle Fries: The garlic on this and the brown sauce was nommalicious! Def order these.   Kalbi Burger: Took a bite of this from my friend and it was gooooood. The kimchi inside was clutch and the pickles on the side were essential to the pursuit of the \"perfect bite\".   All in all, great food and well drinks. Highlights were the oxtail fries and the juicy & tender burgers. I'd recommend to a friend, but make sure your waitress doesn't hustle you with the seating.",

Since I heard this place gets busy, I called ahead a few minutes right after they opened to see if there was a line. The lady said no wait, but once we got there (maybe 15-20) minutes later, there was a short 15 minute wait. This place can get super busy quick! As far as food, we started off with oxtail fries & the steamed pork buns, which were both amazing! I ended up ordering the Ronin burger which was cooked to perfection. In addition to the food, I ordered a honey dew boba. Eh, it was watered down & not worth getting.  Overall, definitely worth stopping by! :)",

I would love to sit down and actually enjoy my meal while I converse with friends but since it's crowded and busy most of the time, I guess they want to maximize profit.

The burger was cooked perfectly medium rare (this is a lot to ask for at other places), the bun was delightfully light and fluffy.  It was at least a 3 napkin job due to the sauce and egg.  The truffle fries were good, but I think we would skip them for regular fries or garlic fries.  They used a truffle gravy.  I think a truffle salt or oil would be tastier.

It was Sunday afternoon and I was starting to regret waiting this long for a burger. My family and I waited for 45 minutes, but the moment I took a bite out of the miyagi-san burger, the pain my feet endured was history. The burger had several layers of textures to it. From the soft bun to the crispy onion rings, to the juicy burger, to the tart yet sweet sauce and finally down to the oozing goodness of the over easy egg--I am drooling as I describe this.   Other than the burger, you must get the onion rings! In general, onion rings are tasty in almost any restaurant, but these are even tastier. The rings are battered lightly, and they're really crispy!   As for customer service, Kelly the waitress was extremely helpful and kind to us. Our glasses were always full and she made sure we had everything we need. MAYBE the hostess had a little attitude, but it is totally understandable when people kept checking if their table was ready when she specifically said the wait would be 45 minutes. People need to either wait patiently or go to the Subways down the street.",

I had really high expectations of this place based on the amount of reviews and pics they have on Yelp however their service and some of their food fell short of a 4 or 5 star rating.     Food~ the burgers are very creative with loads of extra flavorful  additions like caramelized onions, cheeses, ox tail chili and various cheeses.  The extra favors are a bit much considering everything is piled onto an angus beef patty that is difficult to taste with everything else piled on.  A lot of people like these burgers, so give them a try!    I also thing the truffle fries are over seasoned and like with their burger, it was difficult to taste the actual fry for all of the sodium and truffle sauce.  Again a lot of people like them.  I really like their sweet potato fries!",

Love their truffle fries and they have a lot of varieties of boba tea as well. Perhaps the most shocking part of the whole experience is that it is moderately priced. They could easily charge way more for their food and keep it pretty reasonable. Service is always great as well. Highly recommend this restaurant!",

My group had the spicy edamame, oxtail fries, Miyagi san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, the Bahn Mi Burger, and the Kiki's Burger.   Edamame was addicting. I call them Japanese french fries.  Miyagi burger was the most familiar thing I had tasted with the fried egg and onions on the burger. The Bahn Mi burger was good with the strong taste of the pate being my only dislike. The Kikl's Burger was tasty but the sauce was a little sweet for my taste. The Oxtail fries were really good. theres something about a fried egg broken all over fries that just makes everything come together.  Overall it was a good experience. Would like to go back and try the pork buns and the spicy miso burger. Will return soon.",

Packed in a crowed waiting area in full view of open tables isn't a great way to start your dining experience. When we were finally sat, a hurried bus boy drops two waters and disappears, he would be the only acknowledgement from any of the staff for over 20 min.   When the waitress eventually showed up to take our order she informed us they were either out of items or did not stock such crazy hamburger toppings like dill pickles.   The food arrives its sub par at best. You'll enjoy you burger better at any fast food establishment. The ox tail chili was reminiscent of the area it originated on the ox (Hormel had a better recipe), and I don't know what the \"plantation sweet tea\" is supposed to be but it damn sure isn't tea.   Year another \"hipster db my menu is hip and cool cause we put crazy things on things that never should go together\" place. Again don't waste your time.",

The first couple of times we went into the establishment we had horrible service.  Our first visit had us had us waiting over 45 minutes just to be asked what we wanted to drink!  My wife and I both felt it would be unfair to judge the place bast on customer service and not have tried their food, and I am glad we did.  The service had greatly improved ,and their burgers are excellent.  I have tried almost every burger on the menu without a negative experience.  Their sweet potato fries and truffle fires are amazing. Their sake is also very good and served in some rather interesting carafe styles..  The one down side to this place is that it can be expensive, and everything is A LA carte.  All in all this place is a good place for my wife and I do go with friends to have a good atmosphere and excellent food.",

Nothing was disappointing. The chicken is fried pieces with a dipping sauce (if you are from Hawaii, similar to Mitzuken or Sugoi's). A must try is the the Pork Belly steamed buns. I was craving this on the plane ride home. We had to try the Shogun Burger, a $25.00 burger but it was soooo gooood! It has Foie Gras, Unagi and although that may not sound like it would be good together, it was GREAT!",

Crab, scallops and an egg on top of a burger???  Crazy as it seems, all the flavors just blended together like a party in the mouth - based on the one bite that I managed to sneak in.  I ordered the BBQ Bachi Burger.  I normally judge a burger place by how well they do a regular no-frills burger and this one did not disappoint.  Great quality meat!  We shared the sweet potato fries this time and it rocked!  Will probably try the truffle fries next time because they looked so good on the next table.

The server took ages to take our order, and then the only other time we saw her was when she dropped off the check (someone else dropped off the food).  My boyfriend had the banh-mi burger and I had the Wagyu beef burger with foie gras (I forget what it's named), and the burgers were absolutely unbelievable - juicy, tender, and full of amazing flavors.  My boyfriend got the garlic chili fries, which were fantastic.  I got the truffle parmesan fries because everyone on yelp raved about them, but the fries didn't taste like truffle OR parmesan.  They tasted like regular, mediocre french fries, so I'm not sure if I got screwed on the fries or if everyone else doesn't love truffle like I do...  I worked as a hostess and server for years and I know how a restaurant operates.  Bachi clearly doesn't.  It looks like someone with an amazing palate decided to open a restaurant but has no idea how to run it, and now that they're busy, they're swamped and don't know what to do.  Having said that, those burgers are probably the best I've ever had, and totally worth the crap service.  I'm definitely going back (which says a lot because I'll usually NEVER return to a place with awful service!).",

It was Literally 110 degrees when we went inside , so first off Thank YOU Bachi Burger for jacking up the AC to stop us from melting!! From researching the menu , we knew what we wanted right away. I had the Banh Mi Burger , and my wife had the Kiki's Burger..we wanted to get the Oxtail chili Fries but the order is HUGE so the waitress suggested we order the regular fries with a side order of the Oxtail Chili (only $2 and perfect) ..Being a big fan of Banh Mi the Banh mi Bachi burger was outstanding!!!...Beef , pork and shrimp made into a burger patty , pork pate , curry aioli , nuoc mam sauce and the pickled carrots , onions and Jalapeno slices...this burger had everything. All the different flavors yet not too complicated...DELICIOUS!!the bun was probably the best burger bun I have ever had. I have been bragging about this burger for the past 6 days...The Kiki's Burger was also amazing , with eryongi , enoki and shittake mushrooms , bacon , sweet onion marmalade gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli !! WOW!!! My wife would have been thrilled to have gone back there for dinner the same night. The oxtail chili was spicy , sweet and layered with gooey cheese (which is always a good thing) we dipped our fries in it and it didnt take long for us to polish that off. Great Asian flavors all around with a comforting atmosphere , excellent service and good prices. We have already decided to make this an every trip stop so we can try the whole menu.....Love it  , love it ,  love it!!  Hands down down the best \"non traditional\" burger we have ever had.........",

It took a while for the hostess to even acknowledge us and when she did, she handed me the menu and told me we can order at the bar. Waited and waited...and waited for someone to finally greet me. Surprised how long it took given the fact there were so many waiters walking by, not even a hi/hello etc... FINALLY made eye contact with one of the three employees behind the bar BUT to only tell me that it'll be a 45 min wait for takeout the same as waiting to be seated! WTF is the point of takeout and on top of that, if that was the case someone (anyone) should've told us from the get and not have us wait around. No apology, no nothing! We ended up at McDonalds down the street and believe it or not, their customer service was 100xs better! So so so disappointed......",

I had the same thing the No Meat Here Burger, and again my palette was refreshed. It must have been the mushroom or something because it tasted a little out of this world.

The wait time was said to be 25 minutes for a party of 3. It ended up  being about an hour wait, but that wasn't the worst part. There was a party of 2 sitting at a table made for 3 or more... when there was a table for 2 that was open right next to them. So guess where they sat our party? Yes, they sat my party of 3 in the table made for 2 when they could have easily moved the party of 2, who just got their waters, to our table. It bugged me so much that I had to take a star away from them...    BUT the food made up for that silliness.   \"Kiki Burger\" Angus Beef, Sauteed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion  Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli (Got the info from their website) BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD. Everything about this burger was so right. The way the beef was cooked (order it medium, it's the best that way) down to how the buns were toasted. The mixture of the bacon, sweet onion and mushrooms were just heaven in my mouth. Seriously, the best I've had. [$10-11]   I ordered the \"Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries\" thinking that it would be enough for one person. I was so very wrong. It took 3 of us to take it down (still had left overs). Definitely a great combo too. It had an egg on top & the fries were crispy! Loved it as well! [$11] Service was on point & the place was very clean... Great experience here. Definitely will be back when I get back to Vegas. It's \"a must have\" for me now.",

    "text": "What a great recommendation from my fellow Yelper friend, Hope C!  I rented a car in Vegas and decided to dine off the strip. Burger joints in Vegas are a dime a dozen, so I was a little skeptical at first about driving off strip to grab a burger. It turns out that Bachi Burger served up one of the best burgers i've EVER had.  The restaurant has two locations in Las Vegas, both of which are off the strip. This means you need to access to a car (be it rental or taxi) in order to get here. This Bachi Burger is located in a random plaza 10 minutes away from the main Las Vegas Strip.  My buddies and I each ordered a burger. We also shared the Truffle Parmesan Fries ($5) and Pork Belly Steamed Buns ($10). To be honest, the tastiness of my burger overshadowed the appetizers.   The truffle fries were good, but not great. Maybe i'm just not accustomed to the taste of truffle, especially when paired with fries. I thought the combination was a little too salty. Even with the truffle sauce, I was still craving ketchup. The fries are barely big enough to share between two people. I would opt for the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries next time.   The Pork Belly Steamed Buns were good. Three buns come in one order. The pork was soft and juicy. I appreciate the use of radish to add crunch and texture to an otherwise \"soft\" dish. However, I still prefer cucumber over radish in this dish. For this reason, I favor Momofuku's version. I also believe they used excessive Hoisin sauce, which masked the intrinsic flavor of the pork belly.   The Spicy Miso Burger was the real shining star of the meal. I never guessed that miso would go so well with a burger, but it does! The subtle sweetness and saltiness pairs well with the Angus Beef. The additional flavors from the runny fried egg and mild heat from the shishito peppers make this burger exceptional.   If you love burgers and happen to have access to a car, by all means, check Bachi Burger out! You won't regret it.",

One of my co-workers brought this place up. So we all met up and took taxi. It was about a $20 cab ride.. When we got there we had to wait for 15 minutes.. We looked at the menu and there were a lot of things we wanted to try.   We started off with Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries. It was spicy because of the Jalepenos, but it was so good and flavorful!! We also ordered regular fries which was mediocre and shrimp chips that reminded me of my childhood, which was a plus!   I ordered a Thai Iced Tea at a burger place. I had better Thai Iced Teas.. Then I ordered a Grass Fed Wagyu Burger which had an egg, bacon, and onion strings! It was so good! I ordered it Medium and it was perfect! It was so juicy and lean..   The only downside about this place that it's far from the strip so we waited almost 2 hours for a cab to pick us up. There are no cabs in the area so who would want to leave the strip when the money maker is on the strip.",

Here I am, sitting at the table with big curly hair, disgusted that I might have eaten a piece of the hair intertwined in my meat, and she asks if it's mine. The nerve LOL We won't be back, ever!",

Huge mistake. The tan tan mien was horrible. The consistency made me want to throw up. I also received my noodles cold and hard. Ew.

It was good but way more than we can finish. It's not a knock, just a warning that this is more of a large group app or for a meal unto itself. The marrow was absolutely divine! It was cooked to perfection served on the bone and you eat with little triangle toasts. I wanted more!   For my main course I had Kiki's Burger which featured specialty mushrooms. This is where I had to knock off a star. They ran out of the featured ingredient (mushrooms)! Really?! We came in at their opening time on a Saturday. How is that possible? I still went ahead with the order inspite of this and have to admit the burger tasted great. And that aioli - yum!!   Hubby had Banh-mi Burger. That was good too, tho a bit overdone for a medium.   The wait staff was wonderfully attentive. Our waitress was friendly and expertly answered all our questions. She gave suggestions right off the bat. I like that. So yes, will definitely return when we're back in town.",

So why argue with me? Just take a back and let it go. On top of arriving here at 8:45 and being seated at 9:20, it is now 10:07 and my food has yet to arrive!!!!   Let's move forward to it now being 10:23 and my food finally arrived... Llet's talk about when my fried rice arrived and it was extremely SALTY! And when I say salty, I mean it literally only tasted like salt on rice  so I had that sent back and they were kind enough to remake it for me.. BUT when I received my ramen, it was just bitter. I assume they just decided not to put any salt on any of my food after sending the rice back. Like I said, I come here so often that I know how my food should taste because I ALWAYS ORDER THE SAME EXACT THING!!!!   Surely enough, I ended up talking to a manager with my complaints and she was nice enough to ensure a better visit next time I come. Sadly, it was my best friends first time there and she was not impressed. I felt bad because I suggested this amazing place that never let's me down & is always great when I go, except for this one time!",

All I knew was that I didn't want to get a full burger or ramen with my stomach like this, so I ended up getting just the Parmesan jalapeno fries. Two of my friends got burgers, another one, ramen, and the other got an order of carne fries I think. The fries were good for sure, sweet snd spicy and the sauce was delicious. My friends told me their burgers were really good and the ramen was just kinda eh. I really liked their fries, but I really hope that the next time I come I get a burger.",

    "text": "I live in Los Angeles and was visiting some friends who live in Vegas.  They told us to try Bachi Burger since they compared it to Umami Burger in LA.  Of course, I had to try it to see what the difference was.    Bachi Burger by far has the BEST burgers that I've had to date.  All of their burgers have an Asian fusion flair.  Their Ronin burger was truly amazing with the grilled onions and Bachi BBQ sauce.  Their Parmesan Truffle fries are also amazing with a special mushroom sauce that was drizzled on top.   And to top that all off, we almost didn't order their dessert which was the malasadas and I am so glad we did because those were amazing!   I also took a sip of their homemade sodas and their Mandarin Tangerine soda is so good.  If I could, I would've wanted to try all of their burgers.  We also ordered their BBQ Pork Belly Steamed Buns as an appetizer and those were freaking amazing as well!    Please open one up in LA!  I would go there everyday if I could.  That was how good it was!",

    "text": "I remember all the hype surrounding Bachi Burger prior to its open last year, and when I tried it myself, I understood why. After leaving for school, I had a list of places I had to go to at least once before I left again - one of which was Bachi Burger.  My friends' never having been was the perfect excuse to go. Badgering them at eleven in the morning, my friends were dismayed at the fact that the burgers and fries were separate. Regardless, we ordered the Parmesan Truffle fries as well as the Sweet Potato. The former are always a good standby with the sundried tomato aioli on the side. The latter were delicious on their own, but the Yuzu citrus aioli didn't mesh as well.   My three friends ordered the Kiki burger after asking for my suggestion while I ordered the Crusty Crab protein style. I've never had an issue with long waits for food like other reviewers have. The food came out quickly, and we began devouring. My friends loved the bun, but one of them complained that the flavor of the burger only hit midway through. My \"burger\" was a crab cake atop lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion, garnished with a Tarragon Remoulade and mango chutney. It was tasty, a bit on the salty side. Yet, it was a disaster to eat. It fell apart after a bite, and attempting to get all of the accoutrements in one bite proved a challenge.  As for service, one of my friends commented that she felt the need to beat them down in the nicest way possible. Our waters were constantly refilled without the need to pull out the \"I'm dying of thirst\" look at the staff. Our plates were cleared out before we could react. It was definitely the epitome of attentive.   Overall, good food and service makes for a happy Diana. The only thing stopping me from driving the one minute in between my house and Bachi Burger is my conscious. Thank God for that.",

I tried the Lonely Bird- a juicy ground chicken & turkey patty Tsukune-style (Japanese-style poultry meatball covered in a sweet soy marinade), lettuce, tomato & onion in between a buttered sweet bread bun smeared with a herb pesto. So delicious. I also had half of the Bachi Fish. Just as delicious as I remember. We also ordered a side of Truffle Parmesan fries which should have been more crispy.   Service was okay. Thank goodness the amazing burgers made up for it or else I probably would have deducted a star. When we got there, we waited a few minutes before a server actually came and greeted us. It wasn't even packed when we went. We waited quite a while for our food to come out, and when it did, they forgot about our fries. In celebration of Mother's Day, Bachi Burger gave out a complimentary slice of guava coconut cake for all the mothers...except my mom? I did hear one of the servers saying to the table next to us that they were running out of cake, so maybe that was the reason. Oh well...it's the thought that counts, right?  Regardless, I'll be back again because I love the burgers here.",

I got \"The Lonely Bird\" burger and my boyfriend got the \"Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu\" burger and both were is freaking delicious, good thing we split our  1/2 and  1/2 so we got to try each other's' burgers. Hands down these two burgers were the best I've ever eaten! \"The  Lonely Bird'' had a hint of sweetness and the pesto sauce was to die for, totally worked well together. The \"Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu\" burger was just so juicy and again they flavors just all worked well together.  We all shared an order of their famous Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and although it was good, I would have liked it better if there were more oxtail in the dish. I think I would do without the oxtail fries next time and just get their other stuff but  I cannot wait to come back and try other items on their menu.",

Burgers:  Ronin - not a fan of the coleslaw on it Banh-Mi and Kalbi are my favorites.  I need to try the Wagyu burger but it is 24 dollars!  Miso Spicy - my best friend gets this burger every time and loves it  Fries -  Sweet Potatoe Fries - amazingly crunchy on the outside and sweet and delectable on the inside Truffle Fries - I don't like the truffe oil and they are not as crunchy as I would like   Edamame - GARLIC TRUFFLE OIL - most delicious edamame I have ever eaten, have tried to recreate this at home and failed.  Ginger - this one is good, but I like the garlic better   Sodas - Try the Apple Lychee or the Mandarin Orange soda. They are so good, I wish they had refills though.  If you are visiting vegas, this spot is better than any buffet or restaurant you would have at the strip. Don't waste your money. Come here and you will be full and happy and ready to win all your money back at the casino.",

We took the bus from the strip and walked close to 2 miles after that. Ok now this better be good!   Finally we arrive! Located in a newer building complex it didn't look like much. We were seated right away and told about the special of the day, fish tacos!   I we decided to go for the Miso Burger and the Ronin Burger. We also ordered the pork belly steamed buns, fish tacos and sweet potato fries. Our burgers were cooked I perfection and were AMAZING!! One of the best burgers I have ever had. The fries were so good I ordered another helping along with another helping of the steam buns. These things are so unique an full of flavor. Reminded me of the pork belly sandwich I got at Burroughs Market in London.   Now let's talk about the sauces they have for dipping! They have a hoisin sauce for the steam buns which was to die for and also they had a pineapple ketchup that I just wanted to swim in!!! Thy had a few other sauces that were amazing too and all fresh made!!!  For dessert I ordered a chocolate peanutbutter shake. The waitress asked if I like chocolate or peanutbutter more? I said peanutbutter and all I can say is she took note!! So good!!  This place will be an absolute much any time I visit Vegas. Definitely is now another reason I'm excited to return to LV!!!",

The oxtail fries was the only thing that I wouldn't order again. Everything else was delicious, you have to try the salt and pepper garlic fries, I couldn't stop eating them.

They have a delicious Japanese fusion with their burgers and pairings. The atmosphere is modern and their presentation is minimal, which I liked.  I really enjoyed the Ronin Burger and the Truffle Parmesan Fries. I would recommend either.  We visited on a Monday evening so we didn't have to wait to be seated. However,  I did notice that as we ate our meal, the servers would come and clear the table as we finished. I opened my straw, they came and got the wrapper, I finished my fries, they came and took the empty stand...At first, I thought, \"man, they are on it!\", but then I noticed the wait line forming outside and realized that they were trying to hurry us out the door. I mean, I hadn't even put my napkin down before the server came and took my plate.  I understand that time is money, but when I visit a sit-down restaurant with a friend I haven't seen in a while, I expect to be able to enjoy both a good meal and conversation without feeling rushed.  I highly recommend them, it was delicious!",

I had the Kim Chi burger and oh my.. it was delicious. Banh Mi burger? Oh yeah.. I'll have one of those too. If I had a larger stomach and a bigger wallet, I would've ordered a few more burgers. Definitely worth the side trip.  Tip: If you're expecting to go there by cab, make sure you have a cab driver's number. After our meal, we couldn't find a cab to go back to the strip even after calling 10 different taxi companies, luckily for us, we found a taxi waiting at the local dentist.",

I got the Ronin burger and it was a fat juicy ass BURGER! that got my appetite satisfied. Angus Beef  Caramelized Onions  Japanese Cole Slaw  Miso Goma Dressing  Fried Egg  Katsu BBQ  Yuzu Citrus Aioli for $12. Not your normal McD's burger that's for sure. I wish they had this in the Bay cause I would come back more often. Only weird thing is after getting the check and pitching in to pay, we came out short $50...strange...maybe the group next to us enjoyed an extra free burger on us.",

As others have mentioned, the oxtail chili cheese fries are a must. Don't underestimate the portion, it's a huge plate of fries slathered with yummy oxtail sauce goodness with melted cheese and beans. I usually share it with 2 other friends and we are all basically half full before our burgers even arrive.  In terms of the burgers, they have interesting options here but nothing stands out to me that much, though they also have big portions (compared to Umami). Overall a unique restaurant with good price and service",

We walked in an I cannot help but complain about the smell of sewage as we walked in the door.  I'm not being hyperbolic - I honestly think I smelled sewage.  We asked to be seated outside but they were not serving outside so we sat as close to the windows as possible.  It seemed to help and we were really craving burgers so we stayed.  The only saving grace was our waiter - he was very polite and did a fantastic job.  We ordered a couple of beers, the Miyagi sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, the black & green burger, and Truffle Parmesan Fries.  The burgers were ok, not horrible but not even close to worth the price ($13 or so).  The fries were also pretty good but again, nothing special.  I would give them another chance just because, again, the menu has so much promise and maybe they just had an off night, but the food is going to have to be really great in order to get me to consider becoming a repeat customer.",

For the exotic beers they offer, I can see the draw in that. My family and I, however, have only eaten their for lunch or dinner.   We've never had bad service. Beware of wait times, though!",

Just like a lot of other Yelpers, I've wanted to try this place since seeing it on Food Network.  When we got there the hostess said there was a 25 minute wait. No problem! We'll just sit at the Bar. By the time I could order my Kambei Cocktail (Sake,Vodka, Pineapple Juice, Cherry, Orange Juice and Mint), the manager Ronnie, who was very nice and energetic, had a table for us.  We quickly ordered The Black & Green Burger with American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, Sauteed Mushrooms, Spinach, Bacon, Point Reyes Blue Cheese and Roasted Garlic. The Pork Belly Steamed Buns with Duroc Pork Belly, Cilantro, Scallions, Radish, Boiled Egg, Chinese Black Vinaigrette and Hoisin BBQ Sauce. The Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries with Maui Onion Sea Salt and Garlic Chili Aioli. As our server left with our order, we decided to add an order of the Bachi House Made Pickles.  Everything was wonderful. The flavor combinations were interesting and unique, while the different textures sent things to another level. Our favorite item was the Bachi Pickles. Instead of Cucumbers they used different products like Seaweed, Carrots, Garlic Cloves, Asian Peppers, Watermelon Rinds and Ginger Shoots. We both decided that next visit we'd skip the Fries and get two orders of the Pickles. Bachi is wheelchair accessible and the Staff was quick, friendly and knowledgeable. Bachi Burger is getting added to my list of must visit Vegas spots!",

The Ronin burger included caramelized onions, Japanese coleslaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq and yuzi citrus aioli plus Kiki's - sauteed shitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, Gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aiole.    We also shared an order of sweet potato fries with yuzi citrus aioli.  At first glance I could not imagine how I would get my mouth around the burgers, but most of the height came from the soft roll as the actual angus patty likely weighed in at a 1/3 of a pound.  We both felt Kiki beat out Ronin and, though the overall experience was good, I did not feel wowed by the experience and consider the burgers to be overpriced.",

Ox Tail Chili, cheese and a fried egg on top of a mound of crispy fries.  That's enough for me to come back.  Then the burger.

    "text": "I've been to bachi burger multiple times and the food is always delicious. It is pretty pricey but every time I received my meal I wasn't disappointed until last night... My friends and I came here for dinner last night (which we have probably 3 or 4 times) and ordered as soon as the guy came for our drinks. We were pretty hungry it was already 9 o'clock  The server took our orders left and did not come back for 45 MINUTES. mind you all we got were burgers and fries and there were hardly any people even in there. They brought out our truffle Parmesan fries first (only 1 basked after 45 minutes) when we had ordered 5 of them and they looked nothing like they did the precious times I've been here. $5 for a basket of fries that had hardly any topping on it and looked like it was just thrown together. We waited to see if our friends fries looked the same (they did) and I asked why they were so different and he replied just by saying he would bring some extra condiments out. **mind you we got our fries before our burgers .... aren't you supposed to eat them with your burger??** Finally the burgers came out which we were excited about being that we waited so long and our fries were already cold. It was nothing like the past times I've been here :((( We all ordered our burgers medium well and mine and my friends burgers were very well done even burnt on the sides. Usually when you bite into their burgers it's so juicy and so many flavors, but I was so disappointed this time.  I complained about how long our meals took and that our fries were now cold, but they didn't apologize just said they could bring out more fries but at that point we were full.   All in all I used to love this place and would rave about it; but after last night I won't be back.  HORRIBLE service, expensive prices, and the food was not good. Not sure what happened to bachi burger!",

Ordered it and expected a chunk of oxtail meat on top of the fries but instead, they skimped on the oxtail and it the oxtail was a chili base, so pretty much it tasted exactly like chili cheese fries which did not impress.  Even the fried egg didn't make a difference.  Manager was nice enough to explain the oxtail confusion and gave us an extra plate of the chili based oxtail.  To make up for the fries, the Ronnin Wagyu burger was amazing.  All the toppings came together exceptionally well and you can very much taste the difference in the Wagyu beef when compared to your angus beef and what not.  Now waiting for a SoCal location to open up.",

And the bun was just so good on it's own. It was stellar. I also loved their homemade pickles because where I come from, we eat Japanese pickles with everything Asian. The pickles (and everything else) was plated very aesthetically and just lovely to look at. I got the Miyagi-san and it was okay. Maybe I was satiated so my brain wasn't as receptive to it. Or maybe it was that the steamed buns were so good that these paled in comparison. Or I just chose the wrong burger combo. Whatever it was, I didn't feel the beef had nearly as much flavor as the pork belly packed. I wished the beef was marinated more or something. I did love the bread though which was squishy and soft.   My bf got the Honeydew boba and that was disgusting. They did not put nearly enough powder to make it taste sweet. Whoever made that should be retrained! I also did not like the ice cream cookie dessert. And aside from the hour-long wait due to construction, it was okay. We will definitely be back and hope the service has improved then.",

I opted for the Ronin burger, my friend got the Miyagi burger and we split it so I can have the best of both worlds. I would get the Miyagi burger! Burgers are similar because they both have a fried egg, onion but the Miyagi burger's crispy onion rings and furikake compliments the burger well giving it more of a Japanese flavor.   Also tried their house made sodas. SO good. Omg. I have never had something like that. It was a little fizzy and tasted so fresh. I got the Apple & Lychee. Refreshing, light, and just the right amount of sweetness. There's nothing like that here in LA :'(   Oxtail fries, on the other hand, didn't really win me over. Yeah they were good but you honestly can't really tell it's oxtail. Just tasted like shredded meat to me.   Truffle fries are good though and the sun dried tomato aioli is really yummy. Truffle fries are half the cost of oxtail so I'd say skip the oxtail and just get the truffle fries.   Truly wowed by this place. I will most definitely come back next time I come to Vegas.",

My waiter was really friendly and gave a full explanation of the menu and his recommendations.  I ended up going with his favorite which was the Miyagi-sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger and the fries.  I loved the pineapple ketchup for the fries as I had never had that before.  The burger was delicious too.  It was massive and I didn't think I was going to finish it but I devoured it.

Ever since Manapua Man closed shop about five years ago, I've been missing my favorite, chubby little hand held snack. Now it's back, split in two, double the price, and served with high-class condiments. Bachi's steamed buns with kalbi short ribs, cilantro and aioli is like gourmet Manapua. For $9, they didn't quite fill me up, so I suggest you go Hawaiian style: convince your buddy that she wants fries, soda, and dessert, then start bummin.'  The homemade sodas ($3.50) are the best I've ever had. Bachi also offers a small but delicious selection of beers--Rogue Hazelnut Brown being one of them (thanks Joe W.).  I highly recommend the Kiki Burger and the steamed bun dishes. I wouldn't waste stomach space or expense on the fries--just bum them from a friend.",

Two tables that arrived after my two top were attended to before we were. We were only served when I made a snide remark as a busser walked by and heard my irritation. Our server was very attentive until the food got to our table, then we had to ask for our check and sitting with our bare plates for a while. Good food for what will be my only visit.",

So all I can say to my fellow yelpers \"Thank you\" this place is yummy in my tummy.  When my family and I walked in a young gentlemen greeted us and sat us down. I asked him about the burgers and which one is the most popular one. Kalbi burger and Kiki burger is what he suggested. My bf ordered the Kiki burger and I ordered the Ronin burger since it looked delicious from the pictures everyone posted. We ordered the side of fries, the truffle Parmesan and the garlic salt and pepper fries. And the perfect way to end our meal is dessert, the donuts were mouthwatering.  Overall my experience was top-notch!",

I've been going to this place since it's soft opening and have been in love ever since.   From the get go, Kiki's burger has been my favorite. I mean, anything with a fried egg is going to win my heart. But, recently they have had this manga burger which is soo good. It comes with the dynamite on it, which just add soo much flavor. The fries are good. The service is good. The drinks are good. Everything is just great.   I'll never stop going here and I'll never stop recommending it to my friends. They have since opened a second location, which I have not been to. Hopefully it's just as great as the original.",

    "text": "So I decided for once to do a review while we eat. Well where to start, well the AC is playing up, so its hot in here, the wait time was quoted at 10-15 minutes, it took 20 mins to seat us, close enough. The strange thing is, we asked for drinks while in the waiting area, the hostess did say that was a good idea, then went back to standing against the \"bar area\".  Okay, at this point, it is only fair for me to say i'm in the hospitality business and the way the whole AC playing up thing is being handled badly, for the review I will look by it, but as I'm sure the management will be reading this, a quick couple of pointers, serves some ice water to the people waiting, no cost to you but makes waiting in a sweat box nicer. Also, how about running to home depot and picking up a couple of floor fans to at least get the air moving ?   Actually, just talked to the manager, it seems the AC will be working tomorrow and the owners do not want to spend the money on fans.  Just seated, serves is nice, cold drinks served very quickly, smart lady.  Anyways, on to what everyone wants to know, the food.  Yeah, it is that good, ok, its better than good, it is probably the second best burger I have eaten.  I had the kiki burger, minus the onion, great burger, the fries were the truffle oil ones, very nice as well.  Proof yet again that quality ingredients gives you quality food.  Desert time, only thing they have is the doughnuts , let's see...  Mmm yeah ok, not the best ever, a little on the tough side, the ice cream is refreshing though, if a little bland, throwing a coffee bean on generic vanilla ice cream doesn't cut it.  So all in all, a very good meal, in a less than optimal setting.",

As a vegetarian I was disappointed that my only option was the No Meat Here...\"Burger\" but it looked pretty good, so I gave it a go along with a side of fries. When my \"burger\" came out it was verryyy high and I felt way to overwhelmed to eat it. But I was starving so I cut it in half (which I think if you decide to order this burger just ask them to do it for you, much cleaner) and after just my first bite I was hooked! I was nervous that mushroom patty, eggplant and tofu would be too much but it was the exact opposite. Every item in the burger was a perfect compliment and I loved it!   Also Bachi Burger has a yelp check in special of buy one beer get one free! The only thing is, its for after 11pm but the incredibly attractive manager was kind enough to give it to me since I was an out of towner. Even our waiter and the serving staff were extremely friendly and made sure we enjoyed our meal. So you have great food & service, don't think about it give it a try!",

We had three burgers  Oxtail chili fries  Spicy miso Miyagi San grass fed Waygu  Kiki   Of the 4, by far, oxtail fries was amazingly good. I love oxtail and this was a great take on it!   As for the burgers, I really enjoyed the Kiki the best. The mushrooms and the sauce had a lot of flavor.   The one they sell the most was the miyagi, which was good, the crunch from the onion rings were good, and the flavor of the yolk mixed well.   Spicy miso for me was just another burger. The shredded lettuce overpowered the whole burger, and wasn't the most pleasant over power flavor.   The burgers were really big. Between three people this was more than enough food, I think 5 people could have split all this food and had a good bite of each and still be just full.   I think for flavor, I still like Unami burger for the juiciness of the meat, but I think you get more value and more uniqueness for what you pay.",

And after extensive research (not really-- we just looked at Yelp photos), we opted for Bachi Burger over Gordon Ramsay's Burgr. We went right before they opened, so no wait!   We were seated immediately and ordered some beers. My boyfriend ordered a Guinness on draft and I ordered a White Ale. The White Ale was very light and tasted similar to that of a Blue Moon.   Now onto the food! We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries since it seemed like a popular choice-- and it was amazing! The oxtail chili, jalapenos, garlic aioli and a fried egg on top of a bed of French fries made for a delicious starter. My boyfriend ordered the famous shogun burger and I, the Miyagi grass fed burger. My boyfriend loved his savory burger which included unagi (eel) and foie gras. My burger was nice and juicy-- both burgers made with beef wagyu and cooked medium rare. Perfection!  In addition to the amazing food, we had a wonderful server. Great value for the food. Unfortunately, Bachi Burger is quite a drive off of the strip. Totally worth it but not feasible if your only mode of transportation is a taxi.   We will definitely be back!",

Party of 3 order:  Appetizer  Calamari - only thing special  about this dish was the sauce and hint of sesame oil...won't order again Truffle parmesan fries - not bad but will use the precious space in my tummy for maybe the oxtail fries next time   Entree   Pork belly Steamed bun - tastes like Filipino  siopao! Spicy Miso burger - not spicy at all but very good nonetheless. We were worried about how well the apple vingerette would taste in the burger but it was very subtle. Kids burger - my 9 year old son devoured it and said it tasted 'fresh'. Be careful with add ons...my son wanted cheese which tacked on $1.50 to his $10 meal  Dessert Portuguese donuts w/coffee  Gelato - nothing special about this dish. Was basically a donut hole smothered in cinnamon. Chocolate peanut butter souffle - came with vanilla ice cream and some blueberry sauce. It was much better than the donuts but would probably skip it next time and get dessert  elsewhere.  Service Our waitress Emily was ok. She asked us if this was our first time there to which we responded \"yes\". Usually this is their cue to tell us a little about the menu or make recommendations. Instead she responded with a \"okay let me know if you have any questions\". She was not the most attentive and we had to ask other employees  to grab our waitress for us multiple times.   Overall it was a good experience and we definitely  plan on coming back to try out the rest of the menu items",

I had been to the location on Sahara and had a great experience and great food. I wanted to bring my friends here and was disappointed it wasn't as good as I remembered.   After we ordered, it took maybe 5 minutes for our ramen to come out which was pretty fast. But our burgers took another 20-30 minutes to come out. We thought they forgot our order. When the food came, the burgers were over done and the buns were too toasted. We saw a little boy at the next table whose bun was burnt! We ordered two medium burgers and one medium-well and all three were well done and too dry.   The ramen was very good so I would get that again.   I would hesitate to come back here as it's hard to tell if it'll be any good. Maybe I would check out the Sahara location again since it was pretty good.",

We started with the duck baos, which were tender, juicy, and flavorful. We also got an order of truffle fries with spicy dipping sauce to share. For burgers I got the Kalbi burger, fiance got the Kiki, future-bro-in-law got the Shogun. I think the Kalbi was the best of the three. The Kiki was good but a little too sweet for a burger.

    "text": "Is it? Is it the best burger in Las Vegas? On the strip, you are definitely not going to find the best burger in Las Vegas. Trust me. I tried looking -- this means I spent a lot of cash paying for subpar burgers. Luckily, just before you hit Vegas on the 15, exiting East Windmill Lane, you have Bachi Burger. The Asian inspired burger joint was showcased on Diners, Drive-In, and Dives, and I immediately made plans for a Vegas trip -- I made it my first stop.  We started things off with the oxtail chili cheese fries. Most times, chili cheese fries or poutine has fries that are left soggy from the sauce. I liked how the fries were still intact and crisp. The ox tail was tender and was almost chili like -- cooking for hours helped make it into a mush of things. The garlic aioli and fried egg made everything so creamy and smooth. I liked the edition of the cilantro. It gave the dish such a freshness and helped with the richness of the oxtail. With the help of the jalapenos which were quite spicy, the dish was complete.  Though the oxtail fries were good, we all came here for the burger. Morse specifically, I came here for the Ronin burger. This burger had angus beef, caramelized onions, jalapenos, coleslaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, and yuzu citrus aioli. I know that seems like a lot of ingredients, but all of the flavors worked. I am a firm believer that a good burger has to have gooey melted cheese or a strong cheese presence -- cheese is always a must. I was surprised that this Asian inspired burger, with no cheese was so delicious. The beef patty was cooked perfectly medium rare with a nice crust and pink in the middle. The spicy jalapenos and the sweet bbq and citric aioli all bounced around and filled my mouth with flavor. If you were to get one burger at Bachi, this is the one to get.  Not feeling like another burger, we decided on the pork belly steamed buns. Filled with an irresistable duroc pork belly, the meat was cut thick. The skin and fat on the pork melted in your mouth and created such an unctuous flavor. The boiled egg added more richness to the steam bun. The cilantro, scallions, and radish helped balance the rich fatty pork belly. Interestingly, the chinese black vinegarrete and hoisin bbq sauce gave the salty and sweet flavor of the mini sandwich.  As a dessert, and to send us off in a proper manner, we ordered the malasadas. To me, the Portuguese fried donut balls were out of place. To go along with the Asian style burgers, they should have an Asian style dessert. To me, the fried donut balls were a bit stale and not \"melt in your mouth\" enough. With the help of the delicious coffee gelato though, the dessert was passable. I wouldn't have minded if it were just the coffee gelato by itself.  Bachi Burger is a Las Vegas pit stop for sure. Next time, I will have to give the decadent Shogun Burger a try. That one has foie gras and is $25. Though not on the strip, it is a perfect spot to eat for lunch on the way in or on the way out of Las Vegas. Even if you want to kind of step away from the busy strip, it's not far of a drive to go to Bachi Burger. The inside has all tables and no booths. You just find a seat, grab a beer, maybe a nice sake to compliment your burger, and have an awesome meal.  For those who are in Los Angeles, well, Bachi Burger is coming! It will be in West LA, on Sawtelle. Not quite sure when it will open, but I will keep an eye out for you.",

    "text": "Parking (3/5) Location is in an awkward area, its behind Subway, so its easy to miss. Easy way to remember is to turn in when you see the Subway.  Atmosphere (4/5) This place is trendy and the atmosphere suits the cool fusion food vibe. It also has home modern art when you walk into the restaurant. Ambience is on a bit noisier side but its suits the burgers and fries restaurant vibe.   Service (5/5) Service is excellent. When they were busy there is usually 20-30 minute wait. They will not sit you until everyone from the party is present. Waiters are excellent and they are not pushy. They will explain the menu and they will give you enough time until you have made your selection. Our waitress gave us a great service and took pic of our entire party upon my request.   Food (4/5) Let me be very clear here, I am reviewing the food, but I am also reviewing the value that you are getting for the food.  I went to this place for UYE that I hosted. I took pics of my friends food, but here is what I got.  Kiki Burger w/ Fried egg ($12.50) Angus Beef patty, Sauteed Shiitake & Enoki mushrooms, Sweet Onion Marmalade, caramelized bacon, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli and Fried Egg.  The burger was very juicy and the meat was extremely tender. This burger is little bit sweet because of the marmalade. You can taste the gruyere cheese and the bacon in every bite. Getting an extra fried egg on this burger was a mistake on my part. I would not recommend it.   Truffle Fries w/ pineapple ketchup ($6) This was disappointing, fries were not fresh and there wasn't enough truffle sauce on the fries. I liked the pineapple ketchup, it made the stale fries worth eating. I would highly recommend it.  Overall (4/5), this is an excellent gourmet burger joint. If you want to get away from regular burger joints and try something new then this place is it, but you have to be ok with fusion food.",

Our group of 15 were all hungry and excited to eat when we arrived ... then  BACHI ... which means misfortune in Japanese.  The staff was just going thru the motions, not very accommodating, and customer service was lacking.  Yes, it was near the end of the working day for them but closing time is 11:00 pm and the staff needs to continue providing good customer service to the end.  The food strangely came out in increments and the wait was one very long hour.  When the food finally arrived, we were starving and devoured our burgers ... which made our stomachs ache after ...BACHI.",

First of all, I repeated my order to the server 2 times and it was was still wrong, had to ask multiple times for a drink refill, waited about 30 minutes for our food, waited another 20 min or so for our check, waited 30 minutes for the waiter to come around to pick up our checks then waited another 30 min for them to return our cards. They had no courtesy at all to give us an update why it's taking so long to charge our card.  We had a party of 6, the trainer informed us we could only split the checks 2 ways but we wanted to split it 3 ways and she said that couldn't be done. The trainee was actually able to split it 3 ways. I don't understand why we were told 1 thing but eventually it was able to be done.   Also, someone in my party wasn't satisfied with the salt and pepper fries and asked if she can get it without the ginger flavor and the trainer said he will fix it. About 15 minutes later someone else in my party asked about the fries and the trainer said \"I can get those fries out of your way if it bothers you\" REALLY? Where's the customer service?  This was my first time here and I do not plan on coming back here. If I could give zero stars then I would.",

    "text": "I can't believe I haven't been to this location even though this one is the closest to where I live... This one seems to be a joint venture with Shoku Ramen. They actually give you menus for both at the same time. Maybe I'm a tough critic, especially when it comes to Asian-themed things, or maybe it's because I know what True Wagyu beef from Japan tastes like, but I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't really go ape-shit over this franchise. It's good but not mind-blowingly good.  After delaying this choice for a while, I finally tried the Kalbi Burger this time. It's a Korean-esque burger that has that Kalbi marinade plus some Kimchee inside. Don't worry. It's not spicy. I didn't really like it that much. The quality is fine, it's just this particular burger definitely isn't my thing. Try the other burgers first if you haven't been to this franchise before. Service is excellent overall. This place is always busy, but the servers did not ever forget about me and kept my drinks full. Food came out fast despite me going in during lunch hour. This joint can run up your bill pretty quickly. If you have to have an appetizer, then your burger and fries (which are NOT included), and you have to have an alcoholic beverage to go along with your fancy burger, then top it off with some dessert, you're looking at $35+ easily per person. This is definitely a joint that you go to for the hip-ness of it.",

Miyagi was good too but nothing spectacular. Now to the Garlic jalapeno fries. Killer is the definition ! Wowow, this is something you don't find anywhere else . Crispy fried jalapeno , scallions and garlic with skat and Pepper makes this a must try at this place . Overall it's worth the visit and its claim to fame .",

We walked right in and got a table immediately. Our server was very sweet and prompt even though it was a full restaurant. Another guest came to complain to our server that they had not yet been greeted after 10 minutes and a yelling match ensued in the back of the house when she went to get the other table's server. Apparently one server was not pulling his weight and was told to go home. It was actually quite entertaining.   We had Oxtail loaded fries which was out of this world!  Also had the delicious Brussels sprouts as a shared app/side since the sandwiches are a la cart. We enjoyed every bite of the Banh Mi burger, the Kiki burger and the pork belly steamed buns. I am looking forward to going back to try the noodle bowls. They looked huge and delicious!! Between the three of us, we had cocktails, beer, and a few of their delicious and refreshing teas.   The four star review would have been a five, but one bathroom was out of order while the other was in disarray, they were out of a few items that we asked for, And because there were seats outside, but apparently the patio was closed. It was a beautiful day out and I love indoor/outdoor options.   Overall, I can't wait to go back and would definitely recommend!",

The oxtail chili cheese fries as AMAZING as well. So much richness and flavors. The kicker was the fresh jalapenos that added the necessary fresh and crisp (and spicy) element to this plate. I couldn't even finish half of the plate. The wifey enjoyed her burger and the garlic fries even more.   Service was great. Our server was patient and friendly.  The quality and love they put in this food is noticeable from the presentation to the actual taste. Highly recommended!",

Water was good, however.   We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and shared two burgers - the spicy miso burger and the ronin burger. Both burgers were great, but there was something about the miso burger that stood out a little more. The fries were amazing, and I would have finished them had I not been wearing a crop top and out with a cute boy I was crushing on. Hahaha.",

    "text": "Will never return.  Their speciality burgers are too weird for me -- ingredients I've never heard of like lup cheong sausage, shisito pepper and yamamomo peach.  On my husband's first visit, he ordered a regular burger.  It was okay, but at $15 it should be.  We had lunch here this week with friends who like the restaurant.  We didn't want truffle fries, so we ordered the \"Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries.\"  They were good, but had raw slices of jalepeno mixed in.    Not wanting beef, my husband ordered the chicken/turkey 'burger.'  He said it was okay, but he wouldn't order it again.  Not wanting beef, I ordered a fish sandwich.  It's cod.  It should have been fine, but it stunk; smelled fishy which means the fish isn't fresh.  It also didn't taste good; I only ate half and left the rest.  It took a long time before anyone came to take our drink orders, even though half the tables were empty.  One bathroom was closed, so my husband used the second bathroom.  He said it was disgusting -- then an employee walked out of a stall and out the door WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS!!!!  The restaurant is over-priced; the food is too weird for me.  What ever happened to a traditional burger?  If you want a speciality burger, I recommend Burgers & Brews inside the M.  And the whole bathroom thing.....",

This is the burger equivalent of hanging the Mona List in the Eiffel Tower above a tower of Faberge Eggs. Things don't just go together between the bun, they team up to create one of the most unique food experiences out there...particularly when their allies in the fry basket are competing for your attention.

The place had a few open tables but the lack of servers/service made seating take alot longer than it really should have, and honestly the service was even spotty once we got seated.  The food we got made up for it all tho. I ordered \"Miyagi-san Grass Feed Wagyu Burger  with Salt and Pepper fries. Both were excellent and delicious. I loved the jalapeno touch they added to the fries.    Co-Workers ordered sweet potatoes fries which were excellent along with a Black and Green burger and rissoto wagyu burger. The both also enjoyed their meals.  I would absolutely come back. Even with the spotty service it was good enough to where I would like to come try some other their other burgers. Price point is basically $20 a head if you're not drinking.",

    "text": "Great experience and unique burgers!! This place not only has a great burger, but an extraordinary one. The theme among the burger variations focuses on Asian ingredients and the umami is strong! Bachi has also joined forces with a ramen restaurant next door, so both options are available and the menu is  is extensive.   The Kiki burger was sampled, along with their famous salt and pepper garlic fries and a wedge salad. Fries were shoestring and cooked well, but the topping mixture was what set them apart. Fresh garlic, cilantro, and shaved jalapenos tossed with hot fries and a sprinkling of S & P really gave the potatoes a bright and zingy flavor. The wedge salad was not only good but presented creatively (see photo) and the dressing tapered homemade. The Kiki burger was awesome. While the char on the exterior of the patty was a bit overdone for my taste, the toppings on the burger were yummy and the bun was soft and tasty. Service at Bachi was excellent. The interior needs a little better upkeep and more appealing environment; i.e. table surfaces look shabby and floor not that clean.   If you're looking for a different burger, Bachi is your place, and I will return! Hopefully, to try some ramen too...",

I had the Kiki burger with angus beef, shiitake&eryngii mushroom, enoki onion marinade, gruuere cheese, and garlic chili aioli. I also ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries. The burger was unforgettable. I wish I could had taken 2 or 3 to go. The fries were decent. Nothing really spectacular and they cost almost as much as the burger themself. The main downside of why I couldn't give this location 5 stars is because of the service. It took approximately 20 minutes for our waitress to take our DRINK ORDER, not food, and then about another 20 minutes to give us our check after we had asked for it. Otherwise I would totally recommend this place for the delicious and great pricing burgers.",

Prices can vary depending on what you order, but I've always averaged at $20+ for a burger/fries/drink so it's not really on the cheap side.  I've tried about 4 different types of burgers here and they just don't disappoint! Meat is super juicy, their sauces are amazing and bread is delicious as well. I just don't care what people say after eating their garlic fries, it's very good! *5 star for the food.  Service is very good, just not good enough to give 5 stars though. It took some time for the waitress to help us out, but from there she made our experience pleasant. *4 stars for the service.  For a relatively small restaurant, this place seats a decent amount of people and is very clean. Downside is that it can be a challenge to move around due to the lack of walking space. *4 stars for the atmosphere.  Thinking about their burgers is really making hungry again. Can't wait until my next trip!",

Sometimes they could get pretty busy so wait time to get seated could range from 15-20 minutes. Once you get seated they take your drink orders and you look over the menu to see what you want.  I usually order the Kimchee burger with Oxtail fries. It is so good together. Everything on the menu in my opinion is savory and I think that's a huge plus in my book. They also have a bar if you want to order any other drinks. The wait time for your food is roughly 15 minutes, average. Because of the fries I usually don't finish my burger but the portions are big for one person to get full off of. Overall, great experience here!",

Food was piping hot and yum. Not much in terms of ambiance and decor, but the food is the star here.  It's actually two restaurants in one - when you are seated, you'll not only get the Bachi Burger menu, but also the menu for Shoku Ramen.   I was pleasantly surprised on my latest trip here.

I'm slowly working my way through the menu but my favorite so far is the Kiki burger.  What I like about Bachi is that they take a lot of very powerful flavors such as bacon or blue cheese and mix it with more delicate flavors of mushrooms or miso and you can taste every single ingredient and they compliment each other so beautifully.  It's a balance of flavors that few chefs are able to accomplish. The burgers are so moist it almost seems a shame to put the sauce they make for your specialized burger on but you must! It makes all the flavors pop.  Once you're done, you wish you had room in your stomach for more.  My usual appetizers are the peking duck buns or the pork belly buns.  You can't go wrong with either and they both are so tender and savory you'll be licking the plate it came on. My usual sides are the parmesan truffle fries.  I had the oxtail fries and they just didn't do it for me.  They were heavy and I felt they had this odd almost bitter taste to them.  They looked like chili cheese fries.   The service is always excellent when I go there.  The servers are all nice and want you to have the best experience possible.  During my last visit there, I had a server who was just recently hired and wow! They train their staff well because she knew all of the menu items and she was personable and attentive.  PS! I went there while they were filming the kitchen segment for Dinner's, Drive In's and Dives.  Although they weren't officially open, they were kind enough to allow my friends and I to order out.  I HOPE MY BURGER WAS ON THE SHOW!  Also, you better go there now before the episode airs in about 6 months because after that, you wont be able to get in the door.",

    "text": "Finally tried it after hearing all the hype! Now if it was just food im rating then it would be 6 stars all the way! I dont think it would of mattered what burger you ordered because of our party of six, we all ordered different burgers and each different burger was as flavorful as the next! Pricewise I think is just a bit high to the point that I would only eat here once in a while. Depending on when you go, you might run into some ridiculous wait times which equals to ridiculous service times. When you do sit down, hopefully you took advantage of the your wait time by going over the menu and are ready with your order. So as soon as you sit down, put your order in and I recommend getting appetizers because those dont take as long to make! That is why they didnt get that 5th star from me. I can understand their burgers are made to order but from the time our order was placed until we got our food was about 30 mins. Our appetizers, (we ordered 3 different types of fries, one being the oxtail fries was bomb!). By the time our burgers showed up, I was literally licking my empty plate of oxtail fries cuz it took so long! Overall, I had a decent experience because we went on a late wednesday night. The 4 out of our group of six have been there at least a couple times and they have told me they waited about 45 mins to an hour just to get seated those times.",

If i had to choose my last meal on this earth, i would want to go to this place. What a gem to find in Vegas. Superb. Saw on food network and had to visit. Wish they had one in San Diego, CA.  Absolutely loved the food and experience. When back in Vegas, Bachi burger is a must have. Deserves 8 stars not 5. Above and beyond!!",

Our group had the Sweet Potato fries, Salt and Pepper fries, the regular fries, a Ronin Burger and the Crab Sandwich.  Overall consensus was that it was OK, but not outstanding as expected.  Service was good and they have an extensive boba, soda, and drink menu. Skip Bachi and go to BurGR if you only have time for one burger joint in town and don't mind the strip.  I probably will also not bother going to the Bachi Burger they are opening in Westwood when in town, since Father's Office, 25 Degrees and so many other much better burger places are in LA.",

I recommend ordering the Ox Tail Chili Fries to start off and eat while you wait for your burger.  Also a good snack are the sausages or the shrimp chips.  As for the burger, we have tried them all. Our two favorites are the vietnamese Banh-Mi inspired one and the Ronin japanese inspired one. The rest are good, but these were the best (and that includes the foie gras burger).  Solid place, great flavor, good prices.  Just be patient waiting for your delicious burger.",

The server explained everything and made his recommendations. The Green and Blue burger was the best burger ever (grass fed beef with blue cheese). The buns are freshly baked and don't compare to anything I've ever eaten before.  There are some exotic foods but also the basic burger and fries made to your liking. The staff is friendly. I would eat there again and again!",

    "text": "So tonight was the second night within the week that I have visited Bachi Burger.    Wednesday Night -Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries with a fried egg:  one of my friend, Spanky who didn't order any fries, could not stop eating this yummilicious fries.   -Ronin Burger-talk about explosive flavors from a bite of this burger...how amazing is this?  Was a very creative and innovative burger.  Spanky, who had ate dinner earlier, had to order this burger because it sounded so freakin awesome.  He down half of that burger in literally 3 bites, AND the burger was a decent size.  I shared this burger with my other friend, since he wasn't too hungry.  However, he said he should have gotten his own burger since it was so good. -parmasan truffle fries-I could definitely taste the truffle and the sundried tomato aioli made it so much more better.  We had to order an extra ramkin of this yummy sauce.  It cost .50 cents though.  Sure it doesn't break my bank account, but I think they can easily bring in the bucks with this because it is just that yummy.  But I have to say, the oxtail chili fries made this one forgettable.  -I end the night with the rootbeer float.  They gave me so much icecream!  nom nom nom...  Friday Night -Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries-What can I say...YUMMY.  This alone is quite filling for 2, note to self. -Kiki burger:  well, i honestly thought the star of this burger are the different type of mushrooms that are in it.  When we got the burger, i was unable to taste the mushrooms :(  The bacon was overpowering everything else.  Still, a good burger.  Service:   Wonderful Ambience: Contemporary Nice Feel Food:  GGGGREAT!!",

Only warning was my husband does not like spicy and I did not see anything that would indicate that Garlic fries were spicy however I could have missed it as we were starving. now the bad. We arrived with a party of 5 and were quoted a 20 minute wait. Multiple small parties were put in front of us and the Hostess would disappear often while we waited once for almost 10 minutes. Finally 45 minutes later we were seated. Normally we would have left before 45 minutes but we were starving and it was far off the strip so we knew anywhere else would not have the same quality of food.",

If you had asked me to rate this place a year ago, it would've been a solid 4.5 stars! Now, it has fallen down quite a bit as with their new renovations of adding an extended bar, (limiting their space to seat customers) and the huge lack of customer service...I for sure thought that didn't really matter to me as the food is the only reason why I even came. That got shot down quickly as my bahnmi burger was just not the same as before. It was too salty and the patty was way too dry. What happened to the yummy pickled veggies?? Maybe it was just an off night for the chef, but I will say I'm willing to try again. My lychee martini was tasty, but bartender left chunks of ice in it. Let's just hope this was an off night!",

    "text": "First of all, it's behind Subway....we had a little difficulty finding it and circled the parking lot before finding it.  Service:  Slow like many reviews said, however, we weren't upset at all.  I didn't read the reviews before going here because I was thinking with 200 reviews & 4 stars and all our friends recommending it, it's worth a try.  So I didn't know about the slow service.  I just commented during dinner how we had finished all our appetizers and our burgers have yet to arrive.  The reason why I think none of us were upset was because the staff did seem very nice and were just new or something.  Oh and my boyfriend also commented that I should not have ordered my appetizers when the waiter came to ask for our drink orders because he seemed really flustered that I interrupted his order of doing things.  Also the appetizers came out way before the water did, which I thought was strange.  Food:  Sweet potato fries were really good.  I loved the yuzu citrus aioli that came with it.  Truffle parmesean fries was pretty good too.  It came with a sun dried tomato aioli, which I thought wasn't as good as the sweet potato one.  I think it really depends on personal taste, because half of us liked the sweet potato one more and the other half the truffle one more.  Garlic, ginger, and chili edamame was really good.  I love the flavor and it's so much better than plain salted edamame that I am used to at Japanese restuarants.  Oxtail chili cheese fries was ok.  I wasn't a big fan of it.  I think I would have preferred beef over oxtail.  I really couldn't tell the difference except for the occasional fattier pieces of meat.  I also would rather it came in a smaller portion because it was a meal in itself.  As for the burgers, we got Kiki's burger, Banh-mi burger, and 2 BBQ Angus burgers with some add-ons.  No one in my party enjoyed their burgers that much.  I was ok with mine, but it wasn't that good.  I think the main problem (completely our fault) is that we didn't realized it was BBQ, meaning sweet BBQ sauce.  No one like that the patties had a sweet taste and was competing with the other sauces.  My brother took probably 3 bites and bagged it home for his dog, saying that he would prefer In-N-Out...and all the other great burger places in Philly.  He thought that even though he ordered medium, it came out too dry for him.  His girlfriend had the Banh-mi, with the BBQ and curry aioli, I don't think she even touched the fish sauce.  She didn't finish her burger either.  My boyfriend thought his burger was ok but the bottom bun was soggy, probably because his egg was running down the side when it was delivered to the table.  My burger was ok too.  it didn't wow me though.  My boyfriend and I were the only ones who finished our burgers.  Also their boba drinks are not made from fresh fruits.  I was hoping they were, but good thing I asked before I ordered one.  I did try the green milk tea boba and it was ok.  I don't think I will come back here again.  If I do, it will only be to do take out for the sweet potato fries and edamame.",

So we went to Bachi Burger.   The burgers were excellent. In fact, I went so far as to say the shogun burger here blew Hubert Keller's Rossini out of the water.  And the absolute piece de resistance was the oxtail chili cheese fries.   I recommended the spot to everyone who would listen. I texted pics of the oxtail chili to encourage folks to go and check it out. Anyone who saw that fried egg sitting on that mound of chili and fries would certainly be compelled to go and order a plate for themselves.  Skip forward a year and change, and a visit from that Ferry guy with the frosted tips and that DDD show.  Inevitably, there's more patrons, the food quality suffers, and the portion sizes decrease. Getting on TV is both the best and worst thing that can happen to a restaurant.   People who went there in the past have reported back, telling me how it's just not the same anymore.   So now what?   I guess it's time to look for another place before DDD ruins it.",

When I put it in my GPS, I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place at first. The restaurant is located on the far end of the shopping center almost towards the back, but once you know where it is, it seems almost ridiculous that it was hard to find.  When you first walk in, you are immediately greeted by the host. I have never had to wait for a table any time I have come here to eat, so that is always a plus. During my last visit, I decided to try something new and order the Kiki Burger. It was Angus beef burger topped with enoki mushroom, greyere cheese and some kind of garlic aioli. The burger was cooked a little more than I desired, but it was still juicy and savory with each bite and there were no regrets.  I also ordered the strawberry lemonade. This drink was bottomless and I am so glad it was as it was absolutely delicious. I liked that they used actual straw berries and lemons to make it instead of from concentrate.  Overall, for two people the bill came out to about $35. It is a little bit on the pricier side for a burger, but completely worth it.",

    "text": "Bachi Burger is an Asian-inspired burger restaurant and it was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foodnetwork.com%2Fvideos%2Fasian-fusion-at-bachi-burger-0190103&s=695e22bfb8b51b3b611ccfabbe8213fb31aa81b30443dfdf9a38ee09399ec39e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foodnetwork.com/videos/a...</a>). This popular Las Vegas-based burger restaurant originally had two locations in LA (one in Pasadena and one in Sawtelle Japantown), but both locations were shut down in 2016. Our group came here for lunch on Friday and we waited about 20 minutes. Service was slightly slow, but it wasn't exactly a deal breaker.  ***   Pork Belly Steamed Buns (duroc pork belly, savoy cabbage slaw, boiled egg, hoisin BBQ - 3 pieces, $11): It was a pretty interesting take on pork belly bun. Pork belly had good soft texture and it tasted slightly vinegary. Overall a good appetizer, but not amazing.  Kiki's Burger (angus beef, sauteed shiitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, gruyere cheese, sweet onion marmalade, garlic chili aioli - medium rare, $12.50): This burger tasted a little bit like Hawaiian burger but without any slices of pineapple. Sauce tasted just right with a slightly sweet aftertaste and burger didn't taste too greasy. Sure patty wasn't super juicy, but it didn't taste super dry at the same time. I would definitely recommend this burger!  ***  I don't think Bachi Burger is absolutely a must-visit place in Las Vegas, but I am pretty satisfied with what I had here.",

Medium rare, it was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. Couldn't get enough of it and the beef, is so tender and fresh. Amazing!!  Paired with truffle parmesan fries and a mushroom sauce to dip. Those were great as well.   No complaints here. It's a definite must stop by when you're in Vegas!! You won't regret it.     The staff make you feel so welcome as well. It was a nice experience overall. I wish they had one in MN.",

    "text": "Came here on a whim after shopping for some ingredients for dinner. This was nearby so friend's wanted to come here for lunch. It's been a few years since I've been to this location, or at least a year, Bachi Burger in general  \"Pork Belly Steamed Buns\" - Duroc Pork Belly w/ cilantro, scallions, radish, boiled egg, chinese black vinaigrette and hoisin BBQ sauce.   The pork belly overall was pretty good, as well as the bun. All the other toppings made it too sweet than anything else. I think i could probably omit the hoisin BBQ sauce and it would still be good.   \"Truffle Parmesan Fries\" - Topped with Parmesan Reggiano w/ a side of black truffle porcini cream and sun dried tomato aioli  This was fairly decent. The fries were freshly fried topped with a small amount of parmesan reggiano. I tasted more truffle \"flavor\" in the fries than the black truffle porcini cream though. This was quite bland overall. The sun dried tomato aioli was non-existant. We were not given this Lol !   \"Kiki's Burger\" w/ angus beef, sauteed shitake, enoki, and eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli  This is typically the burger I usually get when I come to Bachi, granted it's been a few years since i've been to a Bachi Burger. Overlying theme of their burgers is firm, mildly overcooked burger patty, sweet everything... Lol.   \"Fresh Strawberry Lemonade (bottomless)\"  The strawberry lemonade was pretty good. The waiter did pretty good in keeping in eye on the levels of our lemonade and made sure to have it refilled before it was empty.   Overall, i'd probably get the steamed buns, fries, and lemonade again, but not the burger.. Lol.. oh man i feel like im one of those to a BBQ place and gets sides, and not the meats... not saying ive done that before.....",

    "text": "Asian fusion gourmet burger joint - with lots of traditional Asian ingredients not commonly found on burgers. I urge you to trust the chefs at Bachi and enjoy these incredible creations. They have crafted these delicious and unique burger  creations that blow my mind with every visit. The first bite is always, \"Mmmmmm ...\"  The edamame is enough to share, but I eat the whole bowl. The edamame is spicy goodness! It's got great flavor of chilis, garlic, and saltiness. It's super messy to squeeze out the edamame pods and so worth it! You will be licking your fingers, great flavor!  Burgers I've tried include Black & Green, Kiki's, and Miyagi-san. They're all fantastic and unlike any other burger. I would order any of those again. Kiki's is Bachi's take on bacon, mushroom, swiss. Miyagi-san is a burger with bacon and egg among other things. Black and Green is bacon, mushroom, and blue cheese. In the last year I've gone low carb (keto) so I order these \"protein style\" with no bun. I've had the buns and fries in the past and they're wonderful.  I generally have the iced matcha green tea. I like the casual atmosphere and the service has always been fantastic. Last time I was there during a college football game and watched that on TV.",

The server introduced himself and let us know that there was no ramen being served that night. That was a bummer because one of us planned to order ramen.   This was my first time visiting Bachi Burger since becoming a vegetarian. I opted for the \"no meat here burger\" and just fries.   The burger was \"meh\". Not horrible but not the best thing either in my opinion. The texture was different, the \"burger\" pretty much falling apart. I ended up eating it with a fork and a knife. The flavor was also not my favorite, though it's hard for me to describe it.   The fries were the best part of the meal. As good as they were, I think the fries were over priced for what you got.   With not many vegetarian options and the one I tried being \"meh\" I can't say I'll be back anytime soon.",

They make a mean burger. The staff here is so laid back and so is the restaurant. On this soon to be 100 degree day the music here transforms the customer to an island type vibe. It is way chilled burgers and cocktails. It is way to early for cocktails for me yet.   I ordered the bottomless matcha green tea iced and at 4.50 that is such a great deal. On the servers advice I tried the pickled veggies and the garlic that is pickled is the best. The burgers that I ordered were the angus burgers but added bacon to them both. One of the burgers at blue cheese and the other had Swiss. The burger seems to melt in your mouth. They are really large too. I have found my new go to burger place.",

    "text": "The food is okay, the service needs work, and the price is too high for the quality. Here's the lowdown ~  I got the Bachi Fish sandwich, while my boyfriend ordered the Miyagi burger. The Bachi Fish lacked texture and flavor. It wasn't particularly bad, but it wasn't very interesting. The egg on the Miyagi burger was well done, which is kind of disappointing for a $16 burger. And the truffle fries were neither crispy or soft. They were just firm? And the porcini cream sauce that came with it was too thin and and uninteresting; we asked for ketchup and moved on.   While service was friendly, it was turtle-pace slow -- to getting our drinks, asking for ketchup, and getting our check. Also there was a hefty delay between when our burgers came out and when our fries did. Timing could use some work.  Overall, I definitely would rather hit a fast food joint than Bachi again. Two burgers and an order of fries to share came out to $37 before tip. That's a steep price to pay for a very unmemorable meal.",

The ramen bar was closed when we went, which was fine since I knew I wanted a burger.   Their menu is pretty limited, which isn't a terrible thing but it made my choices of their signature burgers small. I ordered the Banh-Mi burger, truffle fries and a bottomless lemonade.  The fries and the lemonade were amazing, however I wasn't impressed by the burger.   If I return, I think I'll try their ramen instead.",

You're gonna charge me 16 dollars for a mediocre burger and can't even throw in some fries?! The straws are too short for the glass and I didn't even get my drink till 5 minutes after I ordered and there were only 2 other customers in the restaurant.  Pros:  Food came quick. The burger was not that bad. That's it.   All we ordered was two burgers and an order of fries and the bill ended up being $38.38. So 40 bucks down the drain basically.",

    "text": "I would like to give this place the title: \"Best Burger Joint in the West\".. comparing this to California burgers like Umami, Father's Office, and Back Abbey I've been here several times now and have yet to lose the awe from eating their delicious burgers and fries.  Each burger has their own distinctive flavor but the best, most amazing burger i've ever eaten is their KIKI BURGER(add a fried egg). I remember the first time biting into the burger at the other Bachi location.. I had one of those euphoric moments of satisfaction where all I was thinking was, \"WOW\"! The ingredients compliment each other perfectly, with the shitake mushrooms, caramalized bacon and the garlic chili aioli supporting the perfectly cooked patty.. amazing!  Other burgers I've tried: Ronin- the sauce in this one is great. Banh-Mi- a detailed mixture of Vietnamese flavors put on a burger. Looks simple but has a burst of flavor. Shogun($26)- so many flavors I've never tasted before generated in this one burger. Pretty amazing with the Wagyu Beef and Unagi.   For your first time, I suggest ordering the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries with your burger. It is truly one-of-a-kind. Sweet and meaty.. no need to dip in any sauce. If it seems too much, the Truffle Parmesan Fries is a tasty alternative.  It seems like Bachi's business and popularity is starting to blossom. Aside from the amazing food, it's a pretty modern and hip restaurant with cool employees. This is a perfect dinner date spot if you want to get away from the strip. They really need to open up the LA location already!",

On the same trip to Las Vegas, of course this was another one on the list for me to try. And I am so happy I did! I went with two other friends, both foodies as well, both love burgers too! Again, the wait for this place was long, 25 min. but worth the wait. I've found the trend that long lines, means good food :)  The three of us decided to each get a burger and share. The ones we decided on were the Shogun Burger, Kiki's Burger and Spicy Miso Burger. We started out meal out with two tasty appetizers in the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns. Both were Amazing! Great start to our delicious meal.  The first burger was the Shogun burger...$25. Yes, pretty pricey...But we went all out as foodies! This burger was so mouthwatering and delicious I could not believe all the flavors coming out in the first bite! The Wagyu Beef & Unagi was so soft and just melted in your mouth as the buttery miso helped smooth it out even more. There was a sweetness that hit me as well, not knowing what it was at first, I quickly recalled it being the peach and pear. Best tasting gourmet burger I have ever had!  Kiki's Burger was a delight as well! I have to say all the burgers were soft and tender and mouthwatering. Just the flavors varied depending on the ingredients...which were high quality. The last on was the Spicy Miso Burger. And of course I enjoyed this one as well because of the spice, still not that spicy, but had a kick to it. And of course the fried egg and garlic making a great taste combination.  Would highly recommend for burger lovers. The flavors of the burgers are Asian inspired, and work very well. Want to go again soon!",

    "text": "My friend Kevin told me about Bachi Burger when he was last here.  He said it was worth the drive of going all the way to the Southeast part of town.  Got here on a weekday lunch after 1pm and the place was still pretty packed.  I guess these must be the employees of the local companies.  Decor-wise, the place is very minimalist, a few paintings of Japanese theme to set the mood with white walls and standard track lighting.    I got the Ronin burger, parmesan fries, and the iced matcha green tea.  From least favorite, the matcha green tea was not sweetened and I didn't really get a strong matcha taste when drinking it.  It just tasted different as the tea I got from formal Japanese restaurants.  As for the Ronin burger, it was polished off...quickly!  The slaw, egg, and the burger really mixed well.  The only thing I wished for was maybe for a crispier bun.  The bun was a fresh, soft, warm bun but if I do come back here, I may ask them to toast my bun if possible.  The parmesan fries were also great!  I didn't even need the ketchup looking sauce that came with.  I did try it and the sauce really didn't help to enhance the flavors of the fries.   Except for a few things that I nitpick about, I'm ready to sign up to Bachi Burger's fan club.  They have a large beer list but all of them are bottles including Hitachino which has been a favorite of mine lately.  Lastly, the prices are a bit on the pricy side but the quality and the uniqueness of their product is worth it in my opinion.  Memo to Bachi Burger owners:  any chance of coming out to the SF Bay Area to open a branch?",

Their Oxtail fries were delicious and came out almost immediately. Then, chaos!!! Two chefs started to fight in the kitchen, one of whom was cussing profusely and throwing F bombs multiple times to be heard by ALL customers including my 7 year old. Of course, after these clowns settled down, it took almost an hour to get our burgers and when they came out, my burger had a cardboard stub in it. Manager wasn't on duty but this store absolutely needs onsite supervision and the employees need to be disciplined. The supervisor who happen to be the floor supervisor was very apologetic and comp'ed my burger and drink but this wasn't enough to us to go back. Food just didn't go down with all the fuss and 3 hour sitting. Food and service always suffer when there are bad employees.",

Too say it was worth every penny spent and every mile driven would be an understatement. We started off the meal with the pork belly steamed buns. The order came with three steamed buns filled with pork belly topped with cilantro, scallions, radish, boiled egg, a Chinese black vinaigrette and hoisin sauce. These hogalicious porktastic belly fat filled concoctions will wreck your life.  Pork fat is God and Bachi Burger clearly understands this concept.  Then came the burgers.  We ordered both the Bahn Mi Burger and the Ronin Burger.  We were both huge fans of the Bahn Mi Burger, however we could have done with out the Ronin.  I give them an A + for effort and creativity however the flavor combinations weren't necessarily working for me. Add a side of truffle parm french fries and choose one of the top notch stone or rouge brews they carry and get ready to start loven life.  I will definitely be paying another visit to Bachi Burger in the near future and suggest you do the same.  You'll easily spend $40 - $50 on a meal for two, however this is definitely one of those cases where you get what you pay for.",

I tried the Kalbi burger. kim chee was great, however they were a little heavy handed on the kalbi marinade which truly overpowered the other tastes. It did have a side of bachi pickles which were delicious.   Truffle fries are an explosion of flavor in your mouth... crisp potato fry with parmesan cheese and truffle cream... they're addicitng.  Don't pass on their sweet potato fries, dusted in just the right amount of sea salt. All fries are served with creative sauces.. however you can eat them plain and be happy.   Wanted to enjoy the food, so we stuck with water. A little pricey for a burger, but then again, you're not going to find another one like it in the valley.",

I had my hopes low because some of the spots of DDD that I've been to have not been great, while others have. I had the Shogun burger, which had foie gras and poached pear. For $27, that burger better have been great and it was. Vastly different flavor profile than any burger you've probably ever had. The flavor is so potent too that the flavor was still in my mouth even after I ate breakfast the next morning. Sweet potato fries and garlic fries were definitely great. I don't normally like fries but if they are dressed well and come with really good dipping sauces then I like them. That was the case here. Service was also on point. It reminded me of spots in NYC because the crowd and waiters are kind of hipster, which was cool with me. Definitely different than the strip. It looks like a place that was created and run by young people, but people who still know how to handle a business. I would recommend this place and be back when I'm in Vegas probably for the Shogun burger but I might try something else.",

    "text": "After reading numerous reviews on Yelp about Bachi Burger I was finally in the area around lunch time so I stopped in for a to-go order. The reviews on Yelp made it clear that Bachi Burger had two areas they could improve in: Service and speed. Since I was on my lunch break I didn't have all day to wait for my order, so I asked how long it would take before I even looked at the menu. 10-15 minutes is what I was told by a pretty friendly employee.  I decided to get Kiki's Burger, sweet potato fries and a cantaloupe milk tea with boba... Total was a little under $20, isn't Micky D's that's for damn sure!   My drink was made immediately and it was so tasty, my first cantaloupe milk tea definitely will not be my last! My food really did take 10-15 minutes. No complaints at all on the service, I was treated respectfully and they got me on my way pretty quickly.  Kiki's Burger comes with cheese, two types of mushrooms, bacon, an onion marmalade that was nice and sweet and a sauce on the side that I did not bother with. It was cooked perfectly, medium as I was told they recommended it. What a great combination of flavors! I would absolutely order this again.   The real standout was the sweet potato fries though. I shared some with my co-worker because I know how much she likes sweet potato fries and she told me that these were \"Off the hook, best she ever had\". I agree with her.   So I'm not sure about some of these negative reviews. Has Bachi Burger stepped their game up in recent months? Did I happen to go at the right day and time? Or were people just too critical? Not sure, I think I will need to go back to Bachi Burger again to find out.",

I will admit, sometimes the wait can be a bit long, but I have never had a bad experience food wise at bachi,  I have had the ronin burger, the kiki burger, the kalbi burger, the duck steamed buns, and the oooohhhhh sooooo goooooooooood ox tail soup (special biatch!), and all have been sublime.  On top of that, the fries (sweet potato or Parmesan or sea salt & garlic) are amazing.  Bachi is one of those places where you NEED to take a cab off of the strip and enjoy the food.  Better yet, rent a car and explore the amazing offerings off of the strip, which would include bachi burger and nielsens!",

We waited about 15 minutes for a table even though we could clearly see 4 empty tables.  Once we were seated it took about 8 (long) minutes for our waiter to greet us and it took another 10 minutes to get water, and after 15 minutes of waiting for our \"pickle\" appetizer to arrive we finally had to ask the waiter if we could get it before our food arrived.  Our waiter was a little clueless.  SLOW SLOW SLOW and the restaurant was FREEZING so it made the long drawn out dining experience a little painful.  By the time we left it was packed and the parking lot was full of people waiting to be seated.  I would have not been so happy with the whole experience at all if I had to wait even longer for a table and then have the really poor service we had.  I will not go back simply because of the poor service and cold temperature and \"cold\" atmosphere.  Felt very impersonal.  Too bad because the food was pretty tasty but here in Vegas there is plenty of tasty food with excellent service.",

My family ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, the spicy miso burger, the Ronin burger, and the pork buns. The food was really good. The spicy miso burger was the best. The friendly service and the unique combination of Asian inspired flavors with traditional fast food American, makes this a place we will be sure to visit again next time we're in town. I'm knocking off 1 star because the boba would've been way better blended, rather than poured over ice, and the oxtail fries didn't have much of a unique 'oxtail' flavor to it.",

Go early or late (open till midnight) cause it does get busy and as per every American restaurant they will take your empty plate away asap (Europeans hate that, wait untill everyone is finished cause we wont leave quicker anyway). I ordered the Ronin burger, honey had the Kiki burger, we also ordered pepper-salt-garlic fries (very good) and a fois grass appetizer (nice presentation).  The buns were soft, caramelized onions were sweet, Angus beef was cooked perfectly and the sauce on it was special. They have a lot of great soda drinks too.

Their menu is full of variety, uniqueness, and caters to every flavor and style you are looking for! Bachi Burger has a completely different approach from the standard burger you might find anywhere else, so give a look on the menu to try something you've never had before!   I didn't dive into their desserts or appetizers, but I had the eggplant, tofu, and mushroom burger (forgot the name of it), and OH MY GOD... HEAVEN without feeling an ounce of guilt! It was surprisingly delicious with the combination of the three of those things, and instantly has me hooked.  The service is also excellent. Take-out is fairly fast and efficient, and the ambiance of the restaurant is casual, trendy, and social. I'll definitely be returning to explore more options!",

The patty was cooked medium as asked and various toppings were interesting.   The fries were thin, crisp, and pleasantly under salted so when dipped in pineapple ketchup they were great!  Prices were reasonable.    Where they fail is at the seating and dealing with guests at the first point of contact.   Half the restaurant was empty but had to wait close to 30 minutes.   Very inexperienced hostess and manager. I HOPE they were inexperienced because if they were.....Having run very busy restaurants in NYC, their reason that they were under staffed was somewhat True but inexcusable because it happened both times I dined there.  Note to the owner-visit your restaurant more often,  now your only under performing by 25 percent but when you get some decent competition it'll be too late. Simply,  food is good but I'm not going back.",

Next time i go i'm going to get the Bahn-Mi Burger because I heard it was REALLY GOOD. We had two different bottles of sake, filtered and unfiltered. I liked the unfiltered (in the pink bottle). The server was really knowledgeable on his stuff. He was the one that recommended it. They now carry alcoholic beverages. They didn't when they first opened.  They have some really good Boba, but I wouldn't suggest getting it with your meal because it will just fill you up. So get it to go or something. Also the desserts are really good. I've had the doughnuts and the bread pudding. But I think they've added more to it.  I like how it is open late too!  I can't wait to go back again. If you go, ask for Lantz or Lentz.

The place is small and was very busy and lots of people waiting for tables in a small waiting area; very noisy.  We were told 15-20 minutes, we ended up having to wait over half an hour.  Then when we were taken to be seated, the hostess takes us to a back room with no other customers in it; I asked what about the main room?  It would take longer, so we decided to be seated since we were hungry.  A very unappealing room.  I was starting at the kitchen and back room area.  It's actually a whole other restaurant attached to the main Bachi Burger restaurant.  I guess they own it too.  Other people started to be seated in that back room.  We each ordered the angus burger and picked our toppings.  The food did come out in a timely fashion and our burger was very good.  Overall it was not a pleasant dining experience.  If we still did not have remaining money left on our gift card, we would not go back again.  Maybe they were short staffed, I don't know.  Next time we will try a week night and see how it is.",

They have some very bizarre \"Policies\" that you should know about.  First, when I walked in, I asked to be put on the wait list.  They do not put you down on the wait list until all parties have arrived per \"policy\".  So, had to wait for their arrival.  Meanwhile, the place was cramped with people waiting to be seated.  I witnessed many people come in and leave because of the 45 minute wait (It's 1pm mind you). We were seated and some guy comes up and slams waters down in front of us and leaves.  He spoke not one word to us.  I was shocked and starving.  Finally, another waiter comes by and takes our order.  I ordered just a regular bachi burger and asked for a second to be cut in half.  By \"policy\" they do not cut the food for you, but they'll bring you a knife.  What kind of place is this?  The burgers finally come out and I was very disappointed.  The outside of the burger was almost charred, the inside very dry.  Plus, it wasn't served with any fries.  You have to order those extra!!  Wow.  Would have been nice if the server had told me that when I was ordering.  The food was overpriced.  a lemonade was $4.00  They're trying to be this snobbish burger joint when really it's not all that.  Seriously?  I will never go there again.  Oh, and by the way, their waiters are rude and don't even talk to you.  I looked on the receipt and now I know why.  Because their tips are included.  They feel like they're getting tipped regardless, so they can treat you however they please.  I do not understand why people think this place is so great.",

Thank goodness that didn't get us out.  The burgers were fantastic.  We each tried a different one.  We took the waiter's advice and ordered 2 different kinds of fries he recommended.  I don't remember which, but they were both so tasty as were the dipping sauces.    Service was really friendly and helpful.  I would definitely go back.  We have talked about that smell a few times since.  It was that bad, however, it must have been just that night.",

    "text": "Mmmm Bachi burger I was impressed with you. The service was pretty good, decor was plain but nice and the food was also pretty good.The truffle fries and the sweet potato fries will definitely be a problem for my diet but the truffle fries just needed a little more truffles. And the crab cake burger was perfect, the right amount of crab without too much dressing slapped on to take away from the taste. Only complaint is that I just wasn't a fan of the actual burger themselves. Not to say that they're not good, it's just that angus beef wasn't exactly to my liking but others definitely enjoyed it.",

Our food took  45mins to come out (not that busy in the place) and then they only brought out my burger; not my friend's food or even the fries to hold her over!  The manager did come over and explain there was a mix up in the kitchen and he ended up not charging for the duck buns since they took another 15minutes after that...Definitely necessary after the wait.  The server did keep our drinks full, but the whole demeanor of the restaurant  crew screams \"new staff\".  Dessert is a must!  We tried the \"pop tart\" and the Vietnamese doughnuts (SO GOOD!). The food kept this review in the 4 star range.",

Not only the burger, drinks, and fries are pricey but the wait is long. It took an hour for us to get our food. If you read the reviews, the wait is pretty long. I think the owner came and asked how we were doing and we asked how long does it take to make the burger. He said 12 mins.  Hmmmmm.... Why did it take an hour?? Anyways, the fish burger I got was really good. I really liked the fried too. I would definitely come back to this place if I'm in town.",

    "text": "I will NEVER return to Bachi Burger ever again. And unfortunately, it's because of the service. I asked if the Banh Mi sandwich was a choice between beef, pork, shrimp and our server said yes. I said, I'll take the \"shrimp banh mi burger\" and then followed by \"no pork pate on that\". It arrived and it was ground meat and I thought, \"okay that's weird. Is that ground shrimp?\". I took a few bites and realized it tasted like a mixture that included pork. So I grabbed the server and asked her and she said that it was all mixed together. At the time I ordered my food, shouldn't she have corrected me when I asked for that \"shrimp\" banh mi sandwich? I tried to get something else but the server said, \"well, we'll have to charge you for the new item\". Excuse me? I grew up in the restaurant and hospitality industry and that is NEVER the answer. It wasn't the cost but the fact that she didn't seem to care. A few minutes later she came by and said, \"oh, we are offering a complimentary dessert to moms for mother's day. Would you care for the dessert?\". Um no, I would love some lunch before my dessert please. I am appalled that they allowed me to walk out their restaurant knowing that I was very unhappy and still hungry.  Really bad move on their part and perhaps a restaurant manager should have stepped in. They should have just eaten the cost of the new burger to make a customer happy. It would have resulted in repeat business that would have more than made up for that $8 burger.",

I got their salted caramel shake, and their truffle parmesan fries because I wasn't too hungry. Shake was great, but probably bad idea to pair with the fries. I wasn't crazy about a particular flavor on the fries that I couldn't pin-point. They had a fishy flavor to them, which I wasn't quite liking.

I did ask the waiter to explain a few items, but I ended up going for a safe choice.

My favorite is the Truffle Parmesan fries and the Ronin Burger (a burger with a fried egg, yum!) We've tried the Oxtail chili fries a few times.

Had to wait a few minutes before being greeted at the door, but it wasn't long enough to complain about.   Our server was very friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable about the menu.   Kiki burger, spicy miso burger, and Parmesan truffle fries were all pretty decent (even though the spicy miso burger literally had no hint of heat).  The only disappointment is that our server forgot to put in the chocolate peanut butter souffle. The dessert takes 20-25 minutes to prepare and we ordered it at the same time as our food. He said he would put it in five minutes after our food comes out so that it would still be hot by the time we were done with the burgers...but obviously forgot to do so.   I guess it was an honest mistake, but we were really looking forward to that souffle and waiting another half hour for it after our meal was not an option. Again, it wasn't even busy at all so I don't know how he forgot.   Another girl had taken over our table for him and ended up giving us a peanut butter chocolate milkshake to make up for the souffle. She was even considerate enough to put some berries in it so it was like the souffle.   As a side note - I can understand some of the other negative/impartial reviews about service. Not all of the servers were attentive/friendly. We did have to keep waiting for refills on our waters.",

We ordered the salt and pepper garlic fries and the truffle Parmesan fries as an appetizer. SO good. he sauces that go with both of them really complement the fries well. the Salt and pepper is definitely my favorite, since it has more spice and kick with the jalapenos and the sauce. Two orders of fries fed 7 girls well, so it's pretty well portioned here.  While many of my friends got Kiki's burger, and the Ronin, I got the Kalbi burger, mostly because of my love for kimchi. It's extremely tasty and ridiculously filling to the point of 'Oh my I'm TOO full...but it's so good!\" Kalbi ground  beef, kimchi, onions, a massive burger roll, and spicy cucumbers on the side. For someone who loves Korean Food, this definitely impressed me.   This is a pretty random place to go, especially when you surrounded by all this food on the main strip, but check this place out!",

I had Kiki's burger, which is an Angus burger, sauteed shiitake, enoki and eryngi mushrooms, bacon, gruyere cheese and a sweet onion marmalade. I loved everything about this burger. It was juicy, tasty, and the flavors were very well balanced aka MOUTHGASM. I also had the truffle Parmesan fries. Yum yum yum!  I would definitely suggest trying a burger off of their \"specialty burger menu\", rather than building your own -- because you can do that at any burger joint.  I'm hoping when I decide to return that the service experience will be a little better, but I'm not really here to rate service, just food. There were other menu options I saw that would definitely warrant a return visit.",

The burgers are at a minimum some of the best burgers I've ever had, if not the best, but that may lead to inflated expectations if you go  there so let's just agree to say they are really good burgers.  I got the miyagi something burger.  It was a wagyu beef patty with a fried egg, onion rings, chili mayo, and caramelized bacon.  The temperature of the burger was spot on, medium with a nice, warm pink center.  The egg was cooked perfectly as well, over-easy with a nice runny yolk.  The bun, an often unappreciated component of the burger, was soft, flavorful and appropriate in size (good mean to bun ratio) and absorbed all of the juices from the wagyu beef.  For sides, we did the oxtail chili fries and the truffle fries.  Truffle fries seem to be the new en vogue thing now, so I was not blown away by them (they were pretty good though), but the oxtail chili fries embodied what I would think of when I think of a marriage of Asian cuisine with american junk food.  There are generous portions of oxtail (unlike Animal in LA who chinsy oxtail poutine was somewhat disappointing).  In short, if you're willing to trek off the strip in vegas in search of a good burger, go to this place, you probably won't be disappointed, unless you're a charlatan.",

I always have a hard time deciding which burger to get cuz they're all good but I think my favorite is between the Kiki and Ronin. The truffle fries are DELICIOUS too!  I honestly was not too fond of the oxtail fries... It was a more heavy dish. Their version of a chili cheese fries. But they have soooo many great dishes I still think they deserve a five star! ^^",

    "text": "Found ourselves at Bachi after a long weekend, hungry for food that wasn't fast food,  yet not lemme-just-stuff-myself-silly buffet style either. Overall: love the concepts and menu but with a couple hangups!  FOOD: downright delicious. Not gonna lie, I was pretty impressed. We ordered the truffle fries ($5.5) (medium cut, parm cheese, truffle gravy drizzle + sun-dried tomato aioli)...what in the holy hayellllll. This was so amazing! I could eat this literally as a side to every meal. The truffle wasn't overwhelming and I love the substitute of the aioli for like, Heintz ketchup or something. Very classy, Bachi. The Kiki burger ($11) was #1) cutely named and #2) cooked to perfection with the best flavor combo ever! I loved the bun, as it was somewhat sweet and pillowy. It had a mix of mushrooms, a bacon/sweet onion glaze and gruyere cheese.   SERVICE: Not that great. It took a long time to get our food (30+ minutes). We were only 4 girls and didn't order anything out of the ordinary or massive amounts of food. Heck, the restaurant wasn't even that busy .. not all the tables were full, so I'm still a bit stumped why it took so long.  DRINKS: The lychee boba milk tea was aiiiiight. Nothing special. They didn't put enough ice, so it was a bit warm and milky.. not really what I hoped for in 100+ degree weather. The lychee flavor was good though and not overwhelming.  OVERALL: Satisfied, good for a try, not sure if I would go out of my way for this again, but if you do, it'll be a good choice!",

Quite a long wait, and I wish there was a reservation system, but I guess it makes sense for them not to have one. Also, I wish there was a birthday thing: I briefly glanced at their dessert menu, but didn't see a cake item or anything along those lines. And given that the waiters were being quirky about it being my birthday, it sort of made me feel like birthday people don't go there very often.   Non-alcoholic beverages: I loved their custom sodas. Apple lychee is the best, the white peach one just tasted sugary (and not very peachy). Strawberry lemonade was also really good, none of that unpleasant tangy taste so common for lemonades.   Burgers: I loved it and devoured it so fast, but I guess I would agree with the rest of my party. It was super greasy, and I don't know if this is what you would want for a day full of drinking. The grease+alcohol just wasn't a good combination.   Fries: so good, both the chilli cheese ones and truffle fries. Note: the chili cheese fries is literally a plate of fries, definitely get it for 3-4 people to share (we had two plates for 12 people, along with 3 sides of truffle fries, and that was plenty)",

A friend from out of town came in and first on our list was Bachi Burger!  Like the last time, the place was pretty empty, not too busy, but the one thing my gf and I spotted was a new burger!  *The Shogun Burger* (not on the website) $23 Features the Wagyu beef, eel, poached pear, and foie gras! Packed with major flavor and super exquisite! I highly recommend getting a taste of this one.  We also ordered the Crusty Crab and Kalbi Burger. Both which were tasty as well.  I loved the authentic crab on the Crusty Crab and the sauce on the Kalbi Burger.  We went with the eggnog creme brulee with gingerbread cookie.  There were comments of the rum flavor being strong, but I hardly tasted it.  The gingerbread man cookie was cool with powdered sugar on it and tasted perfect.  They also featured a treat all the way from Hawai'i called the Tako Toffee.  It's toffee with a thin layer chocolate and almonds.  Another great experience at Bachi deserves another 5 star rating!",

Get there early before you are super hungry. But wow is it uniquely good :)",

    "text": "Bachi Burger doesn't accept reservations, and our wait was about an hour.  There was about 4 parties ahead of us and plenty of tables available in the back to seat everyone, so don't know why we had to wait so long.  Our waitress took our order, but did not write anything down on a notepad. We ordered appetizers, burgers and fries.  She forgot to place our order of fries.  Half way through our burgers we finally were able to flag down another server to get our fries.  They apologized and placed our order of fries and charged us for one.  The service was okay, but the food was very delicious.  For appetizers, we had the duroc pork belly steamed buns with cilantro, scallions, radish with Chinese black vinaigrette and hoisin BBQ sauce. The pork belly was a thick cut, tender and flavorful, and the steamed buns were soft and warm.  The pork buns were really yummy.  My hubby had the Ronin burger - angus beef with caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ and yuzu citrus aioli,  and I had the Kikis burger - angus beef with sauteed shiitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli.  Loved the juicy burgers with the Asian toppings and flavors.  We had our fries towards the end of meal - sweet potato fries which were tasty, and the truffle parmesan fries with parmesan reggiano topped with black truffle porcini cream sauce.  The cream sauce was rich and would have preferred to have the sauce on the side.  Overall, we enjoyed our Asian American fusion burgers and appetizers, but the service needs some improvement.",

I came on a Thursday night and it was not too crowded and we were able to sit at the bar with really no wait time. We started with beer which was actually well priced and ordered 2 burgers and an order of sweet potato fries. We had the Kiki burger and the Mr. Ho burger. the fries were actually amazing and the sauce perfectly suited. The burgers however were not great, nor even really all that good. They were immensely salty and the mish mash of flavors did not work right together, they sounded good on paper but they lacked finesse and were really just redolent of salt not flavor. The burgers were cooked perfectly though and that is a plus. I really wanted to like this place and it really started to fill up as we left but there are certainly better options in Vegas where you can skip this place and hit the next gourmet burger shop. You won't miss anything by not coming here.",

I have contacted them by Facebook in the past.  They tell you what you want to hear.  The next visit will be better.  Nope!  Once I was told we couldn't sit at the bar(where they had seats available because we weren't drinking, and it cuts into the bartenders' tips.)  I love their Waygu burger, and usually get a double, but NO food, no matter how good it may be cooked, is worth this much wait, or trouble.  I hope one of their cooks opens a place with halfway decent service, and knocks this company off their high horse.  Their version of customer service leaves a lot to be desired.  My service should match the prices charged....not even CLOSE!",

Even though there is an outside sitting area, but it defeats the purpose in the 100 F weather.  So I would say the restaurant is more enjoyable on the off night, when you dont have to sit too close to other people and have the time to chew your burger.

This places does get pack during the weekend, but the wait usually isn't that long. I only got the Oxtail chili cheese fries since I was not hungry at the time. I tasted some of my friends orders and it was pretty good. I can't say much about this place since I didn't get to really try the food as much as I wanted to, but I will update my review it once I head back to Vegas.",

    "text": "The best Burger I ever had was from Bachi Burger.  I got the Wagyu build it yourself burger, and it was fantastic.  I have never had such good meat in a burger before.  You know how sometimes you go to a burger place and you get a bacon cheese burger and the bacon flavor just disappears into the over all meatiness of the burger?   Here it was like you could taste each flavor note individually and together at the same time.  I don't know how they did that but it was amazing.  We also had the oxtail chili cheese fries and the truffle fries.  I thought they were great but a friend I was with is really a truffle snob and his comment was that the truffle flavor really comes out in the oil that they put on the fries.    Another friend had the pork buns and commented on how amazing they were as well.  The Miyagi-San burger also came highly recommended in out group.  We finished up the dinner with the donuts which were like huge donut holes covered in cinnamon and sugar with some coffee ice cream on the side.  Again the entire meal was amazing.  The only draw back to the place is that it was recently on Diners Drive in and Dives and there was a bit of a wait because of that.  But they are certainly keeping the quality of the food up even though they are now busier than ever.",

Orgasm in my mouth every time I order it & one of my go to spots when I have friends from out of town visiting.   My boyfriend and I believe their truffle fries to be one of the best we've had in Vegas so far. thin sliced, crispy and comes with a delicious sauce.  Boyfriends favorite is the Banh Mi Burger. I am not so much a fan, but he really enjoys this one due to the pickle carrots and dipping sauce that comes with it. I actually prefer the original Banh Mi hoagy because that's what I'm use to eating, not burger version.  However, Customer service has its ups and downs. One day their super nice and friendly, the next day they're the complete opposite. For example, one time they walked away from our table when we didn't finish ordering our food, and on another occasion they completely forgot about us for over an hour. One time we even had a waiter who carried a face expression as if he hated his life.   Nonetheless, that never stops me from coming here cause their food is good.",

Not only did it come well done, but the burger itself was half the size it has always been in the past, looked like a McDonald's burger size. My fried egg was over cooked, no runny yolk anymore. The only reason I am giving 3 stars instead of 2, is because manager came right over to rectify problem. My husbands burger was also very small. Will try it one more time for deciding factor on weather to return again.",

It has not always been perfect, but they fix it when there is a mistake, they treat there customers well. And overall it's the best burgers I have had in Las Vegas. Much better than Holstein's where I recently got food poisoning.   Their fries are some of the best I have ever had. Just ask for the Salt & Pepper Fries that have jalapeno peppers, cilantro and ginger and come with Garlic Aioli.   Their normal burger is really good and I also like their Ronin Burger.   If you like a burger that's not quite well done but more than medium ask for \"medium +\" It took me a while to learn that.  I'm not big on raw meat in my burgers but I don't like then cooked until dry so Medium + is the ticket!",

We started our meal with the oxtail chili fries which are a must try.  The flavors explode in your mouth and you just can't have enough, the fries are cut thin and stay crisp even under the chili, the fried egg on top adds a nice creaminess in contrast with the spice of the jalapeno slices, just perfect! The pork belly steamed buns are delicious, thick slice of marinated pork belly, greens, radish, hard boiled egg, in a soft semi-sweet light bun,and a hoisin type dipping sauce.  We also had the Miyagi San's burger, the perfect combination of meat, crunch, creamy, savory, salty, and garlic.  Kiki's burger was another great one, the different textures achieved with the addition of mushrooms, and the creamy spicy aioli is just perfect. It is a first come first served restaurant so be prepared to wait but the old adage \"Good things come to those who wait\" really applies here.  Service was a bit slow but we came during their busy dinner time.  Their manager Alan Torres was just nice and came by to check on customers at their tables to ensure everything was going well with their meal.  If you are in Vegas you must try Bachi Burger!",

You will be just as pleased as your burger buddies if you head here. The crab cake is full of crab, perhaps a bit mushy, but delicious, and the fish sandwich is busting with flavorful pesce.

We waited a while but soon as we got seated, service was quick and very pleasant.  Since this was our first time here, the waiter patiently answered all our questions. The burgers are definitely flavorful. I was worried about all the different additions to the burgers but the flavors worked well together. The parmesan fries delicious! And my favorite part was the dessert \"Homemade pop tarts\" . Usually i'm too full to eat dessert after a meal but this was a must!  Can't wait for the West LA opening!

    "text": "This review is late times two... it is a combo review about both of our experiences to the same Bachi Burger location!  During our first visit, my husband and I stopped in for lunch on an early Wednesday afternoon in October. The restaurant was fairly empty at this time, we were immediately seated and our hardest decision was deciding what delicious goodies to try first!   We opted on sharing the Pork Belly Steam Buns, the Kiki Burger and an order of the Parmesan Truffle Fries. HOLY heck, amazing! I consider burgers and fries one of my True life weaknesses and these had me needing a new set of panties they were so good. As if all of that wasn't enough, we even opted to try their homemade Portuguese Donuts for dessert. Also scrumptious and well worth the splurge! Not only could we not wait to return, we wanted to bring friends and family!  Our second visit was a Sunday evening in late December, right before Christmas, this time with my sister and brother in law. Prior to our visit I tried to call ahead and make reservations. They don't offer that but the woman who answered stated they shouldn't be too busy on a Sunday evening around 8pm. You could imagine my surprise when we were told there was a 30-40 minute wait for a table. After reading numerous Yelp reviews talking about a long wait time, I can not fathom the reason for her saying that.  We did wind up being seated a bit earlier than expected (around 20-25 minutes) and were anxious to order. My husband and I wanted to start with the Shrimp Chips. Those were brought promptly along with our drinks, although my sister's beer took a moment. The Shrimp Chips were yummy and like pork rinds. Truly a unique treat.  My husband and brother in law both chose the Shogun burgers while I chose the Ronin burger and my sister chose the Kiki burger. Each couple also ordered Parmesan Truffle Fries to share.  Our server was kind and attentive but after waiting for our burgers and fries for over 40 minutes, I felt horrible that he had to be the one to keep coming over and apologizing for the wait. It certainly wasn't his fault and although we were very hungry, we of course were not angry with him. At some point, the manager should have been the one to do this and I feel he should have perhaps hooked us up with some extra fries on the house for the long delay. Neither happened.  Everyone agreed the food was again delicious and outstanding! It was my first experience ever tasting fois gras (via my husband's burger) and it was divine! I would absolutely return (and plan to) but a few suggestions for Bachi Burger....  - start taking reservations, especially for dinner and on weekends - learn to deal with heavy crowds a bit better, maybe via extra staff? - make those mangers do the dirty work  Those factors are the only reason both experiences combined equal four stars instead of a full five. If you want fine dining food available at average restaurant prices and a relaxed atmosphere, Bachi Burger is the way to go!",

    "text": "Went to dinner here tonight and had the Miyagi-San burger, the pork belly bao, the sweet potato fries, a cocktail, and a 22 oz beer for $51. The quantity and quality of the food was superb and warranted a 5-star rating. The service however was some of the worst I've experienced. No refills on our water, no offer if we wanted another beer or cocktail when we finished the first. We were left sitting with our empty plates and glasses for almost 10 minutes before I flagged down a different server to ask for my check. I would recommend this restaurant for their delicious food but manage your expectations with regard to service so you aren't disappointed. That level of service would not fly at any of the food service operations or restaurants I oversee.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to come here since the episode of Triple D aired. The thing that grabbed my attention: Oxtail Chili Fries.  So the parking lot is a good size, its in a decent sized strip mall. We got there around 11am and apparently just beat the crowd, cuz as we were leaving the line was out the door.   First thing I ordered - the Oxtail Chili Fries (minus the onions & cilantro). Now with that out of the way - lets look at the burgers. I decided on the Miyagi-san burger, which consists of Chili Mayo,Fried Egg ,Furikake, Caramelized Bacon & Crispy Onion Rings. I also got a soda to wash it all down with -which the waitress forgot to bring to us til halfway thru the fries cuz I asked again. Anyways - the fries are good. The oxtail is shredded and the the chili has a slight kick to it. The egg while its looks good, actually gets in the way. No one wants to be the first person to cut into it and if it were up to me - I'd pop the yolk and let it run into the chili!   The Burger - SO EFFIN GOOD! The first thing I noticed was that the buns are actually the same as the baked chau siu bao. Golden brown with a slight glaze. The burger itself was nice and juicy. So juicy that it runs down your hand and arm while holding it. So make sure you get extra napkins. The bacon and furikake was a nice addition! Possibly the best burger I've had.  Overall - great food. Service is good, minus the waitress forgetting our sodas. Totally coming back when I'm in Vegas the next time.   PS - They should totally change the name of the place. The word \"bachi\" and being in Vegas is not a good thing. Its a good thing I didn't gamble much after eating here.",

    "text": "Asian burgers.  I hear a mad scientist laughing in a kitchen somewhere.  Maybe a ninja wearing a lab coat.  I didn't think there'd be another successful fusion-ized dish after the Kogi Korean tacos, but alas they did it.  Dag gum it, they did it.  They somehow are able to capture that magical flavor of charred cow burgers, but still gently *remind* you that this is something with a twist.  And it's not just \"Oh, here's a burger with some bean sprouts in it.\"  They season and sauce so that each bite takes you somewhere.  I had the Banh Mi burger and it reminded me of Vietnamese vermicelli bowls.  I tried the Miyagi, and I felt like I was eating Dim Dum in Chinatown.  I had to look down at the plate to remember this was somehow just ground meat in a bun.  Only negative is the wait (just prepare for it), and it's pretty loud with the music, crowdedness, and everyone yelling to fight the music and the crowdedness.  A definite must-try at least once.",

I ordered the same items as my last two visits, truffle parmesan fries and a spicy miso burger. The fries, with the black truffle oil and tomato aioli are incredible. The burger; Angus beef, onions, shishito pepper mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese fried egg with an apple vinaigrette on a Hawaiian sweet bun; out of this world with so much flavor. If it was an hour wait I would not mind.   Try this place if you are looking for a great burger that is a bit different than most. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive and the food is great!",

    "text": "Where do I begin? Can I just start by saying, \"amazing, eclectic, and mouth watering..\"   If you want to experience a taste of hamburger heaven this is the place to be.  I would have given this 5 stars however, since the restaurant is fairly new, the service has yet to match up to its popular demand.  Although, it took awhile to get our food, it was totally well worth the wait.    The concept of Asian Fusion burgers is such a treat.  What's even more interesting was the story behind the restaurant's name.  From the owner's perspective Bachi is a combo of two things: abbreviated from the term \"hibachi\" which is Japanese style of grilling and \"bachi\" also means to treat others how you would like to be treated in return.   I had to opportunity to check this place out on my recent visit to Vegas.  This happens to be my brother's favorite new hot spot for good eats.  We ordered the following:  Ronin Burger   8 Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, Sweet Bread Bun, Yuzu Citrus Aioli on the side  ***** This burger gets 5 stars!!!  The combination of the ingredients makes it probably one of the tastiest and eclectic burger I've ever had. This was pure heaven taking a bite out of this fresh succulent burger.        Kalbi Burger   8 Ground Beef, Pork, Soy, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, Ciabatta Bun, Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo    ***3 stars- Personally I thought this was OK.  There was really no wow factor for me other than the fact that it was served with Kim Chee  Short Rib Steamed Buns   9.5 Two Tender Braised Wagyu Short Rib Bao Sandwiches, Cilantro, Scallions, Radish Boiled Egg, Chinese Black Vinaigrette, Horseradish Yuzu Aioli     *****5 stars-This was a real treat! Short ribs were extremely tender and the combination of all the ingredients were extremely  complimentary and super scrumptious.  Truffle Parmesan Fries   3.5  French Fries, Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle, Chives, Sun Dried Tomato Aioli     ****4 stars-Looses a star for the Sun Dried Tomato Aioli, sauce needs more work and kick down more truffle sauce too! Overall, the fries were awesome!  Portuguese Donuts, Vietnamese Cinnamon, Coffee Gelato     4  ***3 stars-I thought this was ok.  The gelato was quite tasty.  Overall this place is definitely a must see!  Ambiance is cool! Staff is quite friendly. Price point perfect...   I will definitely be coming back on my next visit to Vegas.",

One of the owners worked at a bunch of Hawaii fine dinning restaurants that are my favorite!    Bachi is short for \"HIBACHI\" , which is a Japanese word for charcoal-heated cooking, portable BBQ grill etc.  Livin' in Hawaii, we'll bring our \"hibachis\" to the beach = D  Prices are reasonable for the burgers.  The \"steamed buns\" are great, but I think their over price for 2 pieces.    I like their beers, its not your usual.  They have a lot of boba drinks.  The decor for the restaurant is modern and spacious.  They have photography art pieces for sale for charity (if I remembered correctly).    One thing I know for sure is..its open till 2am.",

A burger that was mediocre and pricey. Fries were ok, but not astounding. The staff wasn't attentive as I'd expect. They messed up not one, but two of my party's orders.",

If you ever had korean bbq short ribs then you know how this food taste when it's grilled. Sweet potato fries and sometype of aioli was very good. Also had the shrimp chips, haven't had these since I was young. Will come back soon.",

This is their tag line for this wonderfully delicious restaurant located about seven minutes or so from the strip.  Minh found this place while looking through Yelp one day and bookmarked it for us to try while we were in town!  Armed and hungry we invited our friends to join in on our adventure one sunny afternoon. Bachi Burger is the new kid in town located in a new strip mall, they have plenty of parking, but I could see it being a problem if it was the lunch or dinner rush hour.  As the four of us entered we were greeted and promptly seated at a nearby table. Our server gave us our menus and took our drink orders.  Minh and I ordered green ice tea, while we were waiting for our drinks to be delivered we all looked over their amazing menu and their selection made it hard to choose just one thing.  We decided to share among the four of us:  -Pork Belly Steamed Buns-Duroc Pork Belly, Cilantro, Callions, Radish, Boiled Egg, Chinese Black Vinaigrette, Hoisin BBQ Sauce.  What can I say about a fluffy soft steamed bun overflowing with pork belly except for yum yum in my tum tum!! The pork belly was tender with just a slight bit of fat still attached the bbq sauce and vinaigrette mixed well together. But beware this bun can be a tad messy as juices were dripping down my hand and onto the plate.  I ordered:  Kiki's Burger-Angus Beef .Sauteed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngi Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli.  Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries-Maui Onion Sea Salt, Garlic Chili Aioli.   The Kiki burger is more of a sweet tasting burger. Which I was not expecting, but was happy with my decision and ended up eating the whole burger. The buns were not overly bready more on the thinner side. The angus beef was tender along and the toppings meshed well together. The only thing I could not locate was the bacon! Where was it, I could taste it but not see it at all!   The fries were more than enough for two people to share, which I did with my handsome boyfriend! The chili aioli was okay but to me it did not really go with the fries. I am more of a ranch or ketchup kind of gal when it comes to my fries! Fries were crispy and not overly done.  Our server kept checking on us often making sure we were happy with what we ordered.   I think Bachi Burger needs to come out to So. Cali this would be one place I could never get sick of!",

It came with a mint tasting aioli on the side. The most juicy, flavorful turkey burger I have ever tasted. It did NOT disappoint me at all. I also tried the truffle fries w/ the sundried tomato ketchup thing on the side and that's when I reached food nirvana. I'm definitely coming back here when I come back to the Vegas area.",

    "text": "Went here with my boyfriend on a Thursday [5.27] & heard about this place from my coworkers about a month earlier. It was a bit of a drive for me, but hey~ they're open until 1am! Definitely worth the drive because this place is going green & sell local art that they have as decor :) They also have a flat screen tv by one entrance & a lounge/couch area right by the restroom by the other entrance.  I wanted to try the mango or honeydew boba, but the server said that they were powdered flavors :/ I ended up getting the green milk tea with boba & that worked just fine.  I ordered Kiki's burger; sauteed shitake with mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili with aioli on the side. This burger was awesome~ everything about the description made it sound great, & it was! The buns for the burgers are sweet, definitely a good size portion because all of my buddies know that I'm a slow eater.  I ate half of the burger to save room for dessert; Portuguese donuts that had Vietnamese cinnamon & coffee gelato. This really hit my sweet tooth & I'm not a super sweets kinda person, so I let my boyfriend inhale most of the donuts while I ate most of the coffee gelato :9   The service was good, since they are still a new restaurant I noticed that once in a while another employee would be shadowing &/or supervising the server. I know she wasn't knowledgeable about some of the questions we had about the menu, but it's totally understandable because I know that they're training for success! This place is doing great so far & I know that they will open one soon on the southwest area! *nudge nudge :)",

Ordered the Black and Green and it was just absolutely perfect in so many ways. Succulent patty, mushrooms, spinach, bacon, and blue cheese... oh dear! Even though it was a little pricier than your average burger, it's substantial. And I doubt you'll leave here hungry. None of that Umani sliders masquerading as burgers stuff here. Also the shogun burger with eel and foie gras is mighty rich but fantastic as well! The meat and buns really make the burgers. I don't know what they do to the meat here but it's closer to a fine ground steak than your typical ground chuck.  The fries are just fries, but I definitely am going to come back and try the oxtail chili cheese fries.  And what?! There's a foie gras appetizer? I would have definitely order me some of that if I had seen the sign on the way in.  Service is awesome and Mr. Ho is quite the gentleman.  Goal is to try everything on the menu before 2012 is over.",

We had 4 kids with us and they loved this as well! - Miyagi-san's grass fed burger amazing! - The Ronin amazing! - Kiki's Burger was very flavorful. - My cousin and I split the Shogun burger, we wanted to get our foie gras fix as we can't get it in CA anymore. Especially at $26 a burger, we figured we should share. It was delicious!  Honestly, even the burgers the kids ordered on their kid's menu was juicy and yummy.   All I gotta say is wish we had one in CA. I could go for some of their oxtail fries right about now. :)",

Customer satisfaction isn't necessarily a goal. Went in waited for an hour for our table, no problem we'll hang by the bar, but not allowed to sit and order since our party if 4 was too big? Looked over the menu, sat, knew exactly what I wanted. Waited another 15 minutes then server acknowledged us after two other tables have sat. Put in our order right away. Waited for 45 minutes, everyone at the table got their food after the other two tables were almost done with their meal. My food finally comes put, other two tables are done and paid. Waited for the server to come back with my coffee or refill my water but that doesn't happen until I finished the burger. I guess they were roasting the beans right after they picked it in Vietnam. Definitely will not be back. Sucks because we usually bring our out of town guests there all the time. Wouldn't want my guests to think this is how local places operate. Will do In and Out next time, I'm sure they're willing to serve food at a reasonable time.",

There garlic pepper fries have garlic sliced peppers and ginger, and a nice dipping sauce that has some kick.  There truffle parmesean fries are also amazing! What is nice is they aren't soggy or to thick.  My favorite burger is the kiki burger, but I have never had a burger I did not like there.  I will say the shogun burger, while being tasty, was not mind blowing enough for me to want to buy a 25 dollar burger again.  One thing to keep in mind is the burgers always have a sweet element to them, which I like, but my friend told me that even her burger with the blue cheese and garlic and such had this component to it.  She still really enjoyed it, but it could be that this component of their flavor profile is a bit redudant and overused in their burger dishes.  I greatly enjoy their boba milk teas, although way overpriced compared to other places.  I always get the jasmine. Their burger meat is grinded in house which add to the freshness, and allows them not have to cook it into submission, and their buns are super fresh too.  I will recommened that if you get a burger to not get it as a pick up, they are packed with saucy goodness and super juicy, which basically means on your ride home they will getting your bun super soggy.",

    "text": "Whoah, this place is right up my alley.  I am a big old white American dude (so I love burgers) and I also used to live in Taiwan (so I love Asian flavors).  This place combines both of my favorite cuisines in an amazing, affordable way.  I had the Ban-Mi burgers, it has pork, shrimp, pork pate, lemongrass, palm sugar, red oak lettuce, mint, cilantro, basil, curry aioli, pickled veggies, and nam plah dipping sauce.  Try to order THAT from burger bar.  The bun was great, soft, on the inside, a little bit of crispness on the business end, and a good color.  The meat was cooked perfectly (they didn't ask me for a temp preference, but they definitely got it right).  Good sear, a bit of pink, and the meat really shone.  The thing was, all the Asian and American tastes just came together perfectly.  The little dipping sauce it came with really set the flavors flying.  This is now my second favorite burger in town (my fave is still at Daniel Boulud's)  I also ordered the cantaloupe milk shake (with boba).  When I lived in Taiwan, boba was about 20% of my diet.  I don't know if I would really classify the shake as a shake, it was more like papaya milk found throughout Asia, but it was amazing.  Perfect summer drink.  Best thing about all this?  The prices were fantastic.  $7.50 for an amazingly constructed burger (doesn't come with fries, but the $3.50 truffle oil fries were also perfectly crispy, with the warm, smooth center that all fry places should aspire to.)",

    "text": "Innovation should always be rewarded.   And that certainly applies to Bachi Burger; a restaurant that combines inventive cuisine and the best ingredients available.  The \"classic hamburger\" may be the perfect food, but pretty well everyone from \"In & Out\" to \"Bradley Ogden\" does it essentially the same way.  But not Bachi Burger!  They are pushing the envelope. They are thinking outside the styrofoam box!  Here are but a few facts about BB: Hamburger buns and chinese steamed buns are from a bakery in Chinatown.  They grind their own meat. They make in-house pinapple ketchup, yuzu citrus aioli, and garlic chili aioli. They have Garlic and Pepper french fries, and Truffle-parmesan french fries. You can choose a burger made from angus, wagyu, crab, chicken/turkey or beef/pork/shrimp.  They make fresh boba tea drinks and milk shakes. They have an amazing dessert line-up including Portuguese donuts with Vietnamese cinnamon. They have wagyu short ribs on chinese steamed buns. They have a grilled cheese panini with gruyere, fontina, camembert and mezzo secco.  Lordy, I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it....gotta go back to try some of the other wondeful creations. Next for me is Peking Duck on Steamed Buns with boiled egg, chinese black vinaigrette and hoisin sauce.  Need I say more?  Even thought the location on Windmill is less than ideal, it's very much worth the trip.  Look out Burger Bar....you've been outdone.",

    "text": "So we actually wanted to try Shoku which is the Ramen side of Bachi burger. When we got there we found out they are connected. They didn't seem too busy and they said it shouldn't be too long to get seated. We waited about 20 min. When we sat, server didn't come right away. She seemed nice but when asked \"what do you have to drink?\" She named a few then said \"I can't really think right now\". We ordered two bowls of their Ramen. Flavor profile was great but man! They were salty as hell! I've never been to a Ramen Noodle place so I'm not sure if that's normal but we pretty much didn't finish our bowls. my husband ordered a Bachi burger and it was very good so that gave them 3 stars. You can't go wrong with any of their burgers. Also c'mon $12 burger and fries don't come with it???? A little over priced. Sorry but we won't be regulars here.",

    "text": "More like 2.5 stars because the food here is actually pretty good, there were just some other problems with our dining experiences here.  The good: Kiki's burgers all around for the 3 of us, and they were very flavorful. I loved how the burgers had a nice charred crisp on the outside but still fairly juicy on the inside. The toppings all worked together very well, the mushrooms, Gruyere cheese, bacon. It was nice that they left the garlic chili aioli on the side for you to spread on your burger as you please. Also, we had the salt and pepper fries along with the sweet potato fries to share. The favorite was the salt and pepper that is mixed with some ginger, cilantro, and chili peppers. The sauce also complemented it very nicely. The sweet potato fries were cooked nicely but the sauce was not good. The Yuzu citrus aioli had a strange herb taste that we couldn't place. But the best part was probably the drinks. We had the strawberry jasmine lemonade and it was so tasty! It has a fresh strawberry puree with real strawberry bits. We also had the Momotaro, which was good but I can see it being too sweet to finish the entire glass. Oh and it comes in a really large glass so it's worth the $4.  The bad: The two times my bf has come here, they have mixed his burger up with another person's in the party. He likes his burgers cooked medium-well but both times, they have been under cooked and we realized it was because the servers don't have an indicator for each burger's doneness. So while the servers remembered what each person ordered, they didn't know which burger was which.  The ugly: After eating a few bites, my bf noticed it was way underdone. So he brought it to the waiter's attention. They took away his burger and when the waiter returned, it was literally the exact same burger he originally had, only cooked again. This means they put the patty that he had taken bites out of back on their grill rather than cooking a brand new one, like they should have. COMPLETELY unsanitary!   I'm sorry, but a restaurant that will return already eaten food onto their grill is not acceptable. So although their food is good, who knows what else they do that's not exactly kosher.",

However, the hostess gave us great comfort by constantly checking on us and giving us frequent updates. I greatly appreciated that and wanted to make sure I called that out. The wait staff is also very good. They are constantly coming around and turn tables as quickly as they can. No complaints there.  In terms of the burger, it's a mixed bag. I got the Wagyu Burger & it was tasty. You can tell the beef was high quality. It was tender, juicy, and filling. My brother and father had the Ronin Burger & Kim-Chee burgers. Both were interesting as \"must-try once\" type of entrees. The Ox-Tail Chili Cheese Fries were average. They were standard chili cheese fries, but we couldn't really taste the Ox-tail. Nevertheless, this is a great place to try if you can venture off the strip.",

The Kiki burger with wagu was killer, according to our meat eater.  The fries were delicious, sundried tomato dip and pineapple ketchup added flavor.

    "text": "Let me start this by saying the food is great. The prices are a bit high for a burger place, but not high at all for the type of food you get.  The reason I am only giving Bachi a 3 star and not a 5 is becouse our server Matt. He seemed like he was on something that made it where he couldn't think straight, he truley seemed so high that he couldn't even remember that he wrote down our order.   When we first got to the table he took our drink order and then came back about 5 minutes later with the drinks and took our dinner order. I the server was a bit off when he kept making stupid comments about Bachi Burger (it Truely seemed like he hated the place he works at). Also his eyes where dilated and he couldn't hold still long enough to take our whole order and kept interrupting in the middle of sentences. He also didn't let us tell him we wanted appetizers becouse he wouldn't shut his mouth so we had to wait until her finished taking the burgur orders to get a word in to tell him we wanted appetizers. He asked if we wanted them before the meal or with and we told him before.   Well 45 minutes later I told my table that this was strange that we haven't saw are waiter or food in since he took our order and about five minutes after that the burgers show up. I then ask where the appetizers where and Matt told us \"oh shit I forgot, I will get those right out to you\". Just wondering how the hell he forgot when he wrote it down? Either that or he just acted like he wrote it down, who knows.   Well we finish our burger and at this point Matt hides again and other servers have to do everthing for us. Like bring us the appetizers 5 minutes after we ate our burgers (I guess their appetizers are now our dessert)? Well you would think that after the appetizers coming out this late they would take something off our bill of $108 for 4 people, but no they didn't even take off one of the two appetizers).   So would I suggest you try Bachi Burger, Yes, but I would recommend telling them you would like any other server then Matt. The rest of the servers seemed to be doing a great job with their tables, but the people next to us that had Matt as a server where also upset with him as well.",

They are so tentative and made sure we were happy throughout out meal.   Let's start with the basic.  Oh dear lord. THE BURGERS!!  The first night we touch down on Vegas we came here! Boyfriend and I had the kiki burger and miyagi San burger with a side of salt and pepper fries. Everything was made to perfection. I felt like lord Jesus Christ came down and blessed my burgers. It was truly  amazing. All the ingredient mashed together and made sweet love in my mouth.   The fries!! We usually get the truffles but the salt and pepper was to die for. With some jalapeno sprinkled on it? Ingenious. Simply ingenious. And the portions were a hefty amount I wouldn't be surprise if they used an entire ox in my fries...    The last night we were in Vegas we wanted to go out with a bang. So we had the shogun burger with ox tail fries. I personally like the salt and pepper fries but the ox tail was good too for you meat lovers.   People probably be like damn girl. You paid 26 dollars for a burger? You bet. And id do it again in a heart beat.   I don't know what they did to their burgers but oh my oh my, your in for a treat. If your in Vegas, you have to try this place!! It's worth every penny.

However, once we were finished, they were in a big hurry to clear our plates.  Food Review: Ronin Burger - quality meat and tasty bun, overalll good flavor Kalbi Burger - a burger with Korean flavorings, we found the kimchi to be too sweet  Ox Tail Chili Fries - little ox tail, IMO, not worth $11 Vietnamese Coffee - watererd down, not really Vietnamense style Sweet Potato Fries - crispy and tasty-- a hit at our table Parmesian Truffle Fries - fries were tasty, although most in our group didn't care for the gravy Caesar Salad- a little too cheesy for us  For $20/person including tip, it's pretty steep for what you get.

If you don't share this with more than 3 people... you're prob gonna be a bit stuffed by the time you get to the main courses!  - On to the burgers!  - Manga Burger - crab and scallop dyanmite on a 7 oz. Angus Beef , kainare sprouts w/ a sunny side up egg and a side of ginger.... not a bad burger! pretty good, but I felt maybe the crab cake portion was a bit dry.  - Shogun Burger - Wagyu Beef & Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, and Yamamomo Peach.... 26 dolllars for this... but damn.. every bite was worth it... would defintely order this again!!!  Overall, I would definitely come back again and try the other burgers. Probably the best burgers I've had in vegas to date.",

    "text": "Finally went to try Bachi Burger after the Yelp Olympics event, as the restaurant was not far from ClubSport in Henderson.  And I am really glad that I went, because I didn't really feel like going to check them out after some not really great comments about their food from when they first opened.  But after my first bite into The Crusty Crab burger, I was hooked.  The burger was very flavorful and I thoroughly enjoyed it, although it was not enough to make me feel full and more mushy than crusty. And as far as a crab sandwich goes, it was one of the better ones that I have ever had.  After that first visit with the Yelp crew, I went back to Bachi Burger for a late night dinner.  The place was relatively empty (weekday around 10pm) compared to a bustling Friday night, so I was seated quickly and was able to place my order shortly after I sat down.  This time I ordered the Bachi Fish, as that was the other recommendation from Nelson Q and other Yelpers, and the recommendation was spot on. I also ordered the Oxtail Chili Fries, which was decent but lacking in the oxtail department and at $10, not really worth the money.  I would rather spend that on another burger!    Service was pretty good on my first visit, when they were so busy that they were not able to seat us until enough patrons left for them to combine some tables to seat our large party.  But on my second visit, service started out good but kind of went down hill after that.  I didn't like how it took much longer than expected to get the food out (almost 20 minutes on a slow night), and after dropping off the check that I have requested my server basically ignored me.  I guess chatting with coworker and folding napkins or whatever he was doing at the side station, was more important than processing payment from the credit card I had intended to use or make change.  In the end I just paid cash and walked out the door, and of course that was when they had that startled look in their eyes, as if wondering if I am skipping town without settling my tab.    I am not sure if that is what people have complained about when they have less than positive comments about the service here. And I just don't understand why servers do what they need to do to provide good service, than can't finish strong and take/process the payment from the customer that are trying to pay. It is not like they work at a debt collection agency and have to cold call people on a list, and hating the negativity of their job that they procrastinate.  Food: 4 stars  Service: 1 - 4 stars. Seems like it is better when you have a large group or when it is busy, but really sucks when they are slow or you ended up with a crappy waiter.  Anyway, still giving Bachi Burger 4 stars for the food.  But if I go back alone, I rather just have it to go and not deal with this issue again and leaving tip when I really don't feel like leaving any. And I would not recommend The Oxtail Chili Fries, even though it is served with sunny side up egg on top (and I love that!), unless it costs less or there are more oxtail.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch thinking maybe we try a new burger spot instead of burger bar. Arrived just after opening at 11am. Plenty of seating since we were so early. Promptly sat down and ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and the black and green burger. The chili fries were large, flavor slightly on the sweet side. It would have been a good hangover meal.  The burger was cooked perfectly to a medium rare. My only complaint was that there was something clawingly sweet in the burger that I couldn't pick out. Overall the food seemed to have a sweetness to it that was a little too much for me, maybe not for some. I would say 3.5 stars but I can't give it that on yelp.",

My sister lives in Vegas so every time I come to visit, I make her take me to Bachi for that Kalbi Burger. The flavor and quality of the meat is just outstanding. The pickles that come with it is a perfect addition to the burger. And, Bachi also makes their own soda and it is so yummy and refreshing!   Their oxtail chili cheese fries are also to die for. I really wish Bachi would come to San Jose-- we need an Asiani fusion burger place down here!  This should definitely be on your list if you are going to Vegas!!!!",

    "text": "Unfortunately I was completely unimpressed by Bachi Burger.  In fact, I truly regretted wasting precious room for calories and fat on Bachi Burger and wish I had went over to Miko's instead and gorged on sushi and deep fried rolls.  To start off, the bf Landon L. and I stopped in around 10p on a Sunday night and the place smelled horrible.  I realize that parts of Las Vegas have this disgusting smell and if you happen to be the unfortunate restaurant, I feel badly for you.  However, I cannot help but have to include into the overall experience.   We asked to seated outside but they weren't serving outside for some reason so we sat at a table close to the back.  This helped a lot with the smell.  Apparently, whatever it was was confined mainly to the front of the restaurant.  The service was very friendly but slow.  It felt like forever waiting for our burgers.  We ordered the Miyagi sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, the black & green burger, and Truffle Parmesan Fries, all of it quite boring and unimpressive and over priced for what you get.  Don't get me wrong, I am more than happy to pay a lot of money for good food.  For example, $19 for the Buffalo Burger at Burger Bar?!  HELL YES. Any day!! Worth every penny.  I felt that the burgers at Bachi lacked flavor and punch.  They try to make them complex and \"fusiony\" but the ingredients were incohesive.  First, the Miyagi came with a fried egg, which was overcooked.  I guess when I order a burger with a fried egg, I expect the yoke to have some sort of runniness.  The black and green was okay, but really sweet.  And the Truffle Parmesan Fries were just okay as well.  We also ordered 2 beers.  All of this came to $45.  I would rather have given my $45 to Five Guys or In and Out.  I'm sorry but though the food is okay, I think everything about the menu is pretentious and the price tags are way too high.",

Unfortunately, when I got there for lunch on a Tuesday, they were closed!  I was unbelievably sad!  That is why, later in my trip, I made a second trip to Bachi Burger.  Boy, was I glad that I did!  I had the Ronin Burger and my wife had the Lonely Bird.  Both were AMAZING with amazing sauces!!!! Hers was better.  It had crunchy onion straws on it which just added something!  We also had sweet potato fries and Parmesan truffle fries, both of which come with heavenly sauces.  Heaven.  I was even able to get bubble tea!  They make their own homemade sodas too... My wife had a strawberry jasmine lemonade.  Very refreshing!  Prices were reasonable- about $10 a person.  Other than the wonderful food, the most memorable part of this experience was an angry woman behind me.  She apparently ordered her burger rare but when she got it, she thought it was too rare.  She proceeded to be VERY rude to every employee in the restaurant.  Even using the line \"I have worked in the service industry before.\" She said that she comes here 3 times a week and it is her husband's favorite restaurant, but now she isn't coming anymore.  Poor husband! The staff were all very nice and understanding to her even though she was acting like a crazy person.    All I can say, is that if I lived in Vegas, I would be there 3 times a week too!",

Foie gras, eel, pear, miso butter - my mouth is watering again just thinking about it.  My wife had the Kiki's burger and was very happy with her selection (but envious of my burger once she had a bite.)  We also tried the pickle appetizer (meh), the oxtail chili cheese fries and the salt and pepper fries (both very good.)  I had 2 different ciders (who's names I don't remember), and they were both excellent.  While the prices are high, this place is on the same level as Umami Burger - only better.  And I hear they are opening a few soon in LA - a definitely place to check out if you see one.",

We ordered the Ronin Burger with Wagyu and we both loved the taste!  My wife hates the beef taste, but she thought it was mild plus the pickled veggies counteracted the beef taste very well.  So that's a HUGE thumbs up for the meat... We ordered the truffle fries and if you love them crunchy, then these are the ones for you.  We finished the huge cone very quickly as a result. The last thing we ate was the pork belly bun.  It was SOOO tender and moist, and the bun is very light and fluffy, very similar to the buns used for Peking duck.  We actually had to fight for the third piece, but finally resolved to \"split\" it... meaning she had 3/4 of it while I got a small dot of meat and a little bun... hehe I figured by then, everything should be delicious here, so I ordered the Portuguese donuts for a dessert.... ehh.  I didn't care for it,. The outside was good and crunchy with the cinnamon and sugar coating.  But unfortunately, the taste didn't permeate into the inside.  So it was just doughy... and not even fluffy doughy but very dense.  I wouldn't order it again. But overall, I would definitely recommend this awesome burger joint and will definitely go back!",

However, they didn't have any reservations on OpenTable and my bestie who is a local has been saying how yummy Bachi Burger is.  And, after all, if you can get off the Strip, it's usually better.  I love fusiony burgers so I knew I'd like Bachi Burger.    It was a tough decision, but I finally decided on the Kalbi Burger.  He and I got the truffle fries to share.  My friend got the regular fries & both she and bf got the Miso Burger.  The wait for food was long, but worth it.  The burgers were huge and juicy.  Mine was cooked perfectly medium.  The sweet and savory sauce complimented the salty & semi spicy kimchee.  The truffle fries had a hint of truffles, however, while bf liked the gravy it was topped with I didn't.  Everyone enjoyed their burgers & my friend loved the refreshingly sweet pineapple ketchup that was served with her fries.  Prices are reasonable and the menu is eclectic and enticing.   Bachi Burger gets busy and I think the service can be a little more attentive (we were waiting awhile after we were done for the bill) but the food is so delish!  Though Bachi Burger is a ways from the Strip, I would say that Holsteins has serious competition from the restaurant for yummiest burgers in Vegas.",

I live down the street and would love to be able to come here more often but every time I do I'm reminded why I tend to stay away...the most consistently slow and inattentive service. There was the one time that our fries came after we'd finished our burgers even after several requests for them. Or the time we watched everyone around us get served but were somehow forgotten. I understand these are not your typical burgers and fries but waiting almost 40 min to receive them just seems out of line. Now it's not necessarily bad servers, I think their kitchen contributes a lot to the slowness. If you do go and brave the service...every burger we've had here is delicious.

    "text": "I was so excited to finally try this place because I've heard so much about it from other food fanatics. I love me a good burger! I do give them an A for creativity, but that's really it. I WAS warned that this place is overhyped, and I'm sad to report that indeed, this place is overhyped. However, that is not to say don't come here at all. If you've never visited, give them a try! They have really fun burgers that deliver in taste. It just didn't satisfy my craving for a burger though.  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: The portion received could easily feed 4 people who are also ordering a burger. I felt like my beau and I barely put a dent in it! They really skimped on the oxtail and chili cheese though. Taste wise, it's good, but nothing amazing or memorable. I was pretty disappointed that it just tasted standard and you were lucky if you caught a small string of oxtail with your fork as you dug into the fries!  Banh Mi Burger: We just had to try this one. It does remind you of a banh mi! Great flavor, but it still left me wanting a burger. It just didn't do it for me.  Miyago Waygu Beef Burger: It had great flavor as well and perfectly prepared as requested, but it still didn't do it for me.  Service: Though friendly, it was kind of lacking. They start slacking off once they put in your order and don't check on you after the fact.  If you're looking for a fun and different take on burgers, please give this place a try. It'll be worthwhile because everything is prepared well. I also didn't really have a good first experience on account of the table sitting next to me, which is no fault of the establishment's whatsoever. They just made me feel so uncomfortable and I almost didn't eat my food because the older white lady was staring at me and commenting on how only skinny people could eat food like that, etc. Seriously? If I commented on your body type and looks loud enough for you to hear while staring at you as you're about to eat, I think you'd be equally uncomfortable. Thank God they left shortly after I bit into my burger. Rude.",

    "text": "No problems with service here. Our server, Dan, was super friendly and worked quickly to get us everything we needed.   The wait was about 30 minutes. There were quite a few empty tables, so it seems like the wait comes mostly from lack of staff to serve all the tables, not necessarily from quantity of people.  Food was delicious. We had the truffle parmesan fries, Kiki's burger, and the Ronin burger. Kiki's burger was angus beef, shiitake, enoki, and eryngii mushrooms, caraamelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli. The taste wasn't as mushroom-y as I expected, was was nice. And since I love sweet and salty, the marmalade really made the burger. Ronin was angus beef, caramelized onion, japanese cole slaw, fried egg, and yuzu citrus aioli. Also, very good.",

One said 3 days ago, the other said last night, I was in a forgiving mood and said, hopefully not too long before we came.. Also had a very large piece of onion peel with my hamburger, we were a party of three but only two of us were ordering food, the waiter did not bring a third plate and we needed to wait a long time till he showed up again so we could ask for a third plate although they were told we will be sharing. The food does not taste bad, especially considering the fact it is not a low cost place, would expect management/staff to make sure the place is clean!?",

I love pairing them with a bowl of Ramen which again is pretty great. Typically what I do is share the ramen and the burger with someone else and end up pretty full. If you add the ox tail fries you're going to be stuffed.  When it gets busy the wait time gets up there. They have opened up another section of the restaurant which seems to be helping with that.  Dan is the server to have. We all thought he was the owner he knew everything so well. Each of my friends got what they wanted based on his guidance. Fantastic.  Food comes out quick, but good gracious. Last time I went I even tried the chicken sandwich and it is pretty fabulous as well.",

    "text": "Definitely away from the strip and traffic which is good, but they need a bigger parking lot! My first impression was good, Bachi Burger seemed like an asian infused burger place that knew how to do things right.   The only problem I had with this place was service.There was a 20 minute wait in which we said bar or table was okay. After 15 minutes in, the hostess calls the table before us and asked if they wanted to do bar. They said no, and so I went up to ask if we could take the bar seating instead since we were next anyways. The lady says, \"sorry, the bar isn't open seating.\" Umm.. what? The first hostess said that if there was available bar seating she would let us know and seat us. So we were like okay.... I guess. We waited another 10 minutes (she seats a big party of 5 in the meantime) and then calls my name and asks if we were okay with bar seating. Seriously? You rejected us 10 minutes ago.. and then you ask us if we wanted it after? What a waste of time and space. It's just been empty sitting there the whole time.. By this time I was super hangry and unhappy at her, so I just stalked to the bar and sat.  Our guy server at the bar was nice, but was extremely slow. We had to flag down multiple servers and busboys to get our check, and paying for the food was a really long process. For this place being busy all the time, you would think their service should be up to par and they should be running efficiently. But it's not... I would typically minus one for service, but this was at two points (hostess and waitress) where it was lacking...  Anyways on to the food- which was absolutely delicious. Salt and pepper fries- they were okay, I really wanted the oxtail fries but I don't think the two of us could stomach that and a burger. Will be back to try that next time! Miyagi-San- grass fed wgayu beef with bacon, fried egg, onion rings, and japanese spice (added cheddar). This burger was absolutely amazing! Everything was done so well, and the meat was delicious and juicy. Yum...   Will definitely be back to try different burgers and the oxtail fries. Hope their service improves by the time I return...",

    "text": "I love the urban and modern feel you get when you walk into the place. The entire menu is posted on a chalkboard on the wall inside. We were quickly greeted and seated by the host and our server was prompt about getting us some drinks.   The drink menu was fantastic, but the highlight of the menu was seeing Asian fusion inspired cuisine brought to life through the item descriptions.   We started off with the Pork Belly sliders. What a delight. Braised pork belly, pickled radish, and a hardboiled egg. Yeah, a hardboiled egg...I know. I thought weird at first until I bit into it. Then as I felt the creaminess from the yolk add in that layer of texture to the rest of the soft and plushy bun with the delicate tenderness of the pork belly and crunchiness from the radish slaw...pure bliss, really.   Next came the chili cheese fries. So let me ask you, how do you make your chili better than anyone else's? Bachi Burger will tell you to add oxtail. And I couldn't agree more! Using oxtail added more depth and richness in flavor to the chili and had us all licking the bowl to sop up the rest of what was left.   BUT, the highlight of the night was the Shogun burger. This is quite easily the best burger I've ever enjoyed...in all of the land. It's like a super burger consisting of: Waygu grass fed beef, poached Asian pears, pan seared foie gras, mixed greens and a miso butter, between a toasted bun. (What's that you ask?? Did you just read \"foie gras\" on a burger?? Why yes, yes you did.)   All I could think about when eating my burger was, \"Hello Bacon, meet your new challenger as Burger's best topping, Foie Gras. Your salty, crunchy smokiness may have just been surpassed by your opponent who offers salty, savory and buttery tenderness.\"   The Shogun has certainly raised the bar on burgers, but low and behold, it comes with a price. It's a $25 burger, but it is worth every bite.",

The hostess, if you can call her that, was running around like a chicken with its head cut off: one minute she's taking your number, then she's busting the table, next thing you know she's taking orders at the table...  We decided to take a seat at the bar after about 30 min of waiting. (Some lady had been there waiting for over an hour now for a table!) Like I had mention, the service definitely needs improvement. It was awhile before we got ourselves a menu, and even longer before our order was placed.   When our food finally arrived, it was DELICIOUS! I am usually not a hamburger person but the Kiki Burger won me over! I love the mushrooms, especially the shiitake mushroom. It was so juicy! And the angus beef was also very flavorful!  The only thing I can say is: Hire more waiters!",

It until we walk to the counter and check on our card that we saw our card on the counter with other cards.... it was a little ify for our comfort zone... 1 week later... we get a fraud alert that our card was used in LV.... we won't be returning there again!",

    "text": "5 Stars because for someone who rarely craves burgers, this place makes me want to crave them regularly. Glad they're opening one in L.A.   Since going gluten/dairy free, burgers without a bun has been - eh, okay.   However, my friend gave me the impression that this is one of the best go-to places in Vegas. I was hesitant at first because I was hoping for some good Thai, but my friend's enthusiasm got me suspicious -- could a burger place be that good that it warrants a visit by him and his family each time they're in Vegas??? So I acquiesced...  I ordered the Miyagi-san without a bun (and I gave away my onion rings since they were battered) -- and boy, it was so yummo-licious I wanted to lick the plate. I ate every morsel, and since I didn't eat a bun, my stomach had room for garlic fries & their perfectly-lightly-sweetened plantation tea.  My two complaints are:  1. They did not list their operating hours...we had to wait for them to open at 11am...seriously, this place needs to be 24/7!  2. Almost ruined my mood when the waitress told me the chef could not make my Shogun special with fois-grae without butter. =(  Anyhoo, place that can make a bun-less burger taste the way it does has my vote, and a perfect blend of burger-Asian fusion to boot! Can't wait to go back to try everything else on the menu!

The flavor was reminiscent of Korean BBQ especially with the kimchi. Nice touch.   Oxtail fries - yum! What a great idea.  I especially love the over easy egg on top.   Truffle fries - if you don't order this, you're not missing much. It was just ok.  Garlic fries - a lot better than the truffle fries, but alas, not that great.  Red velvet milkshake - if you like red velvet cake, this is a must try.    Vietnamese iced coffee - umm...this was just regular iced coffee. This was not strong coffee from a French press with condensed milk. Nope. Nope. Nope!  Service - ever time I've gone, the service has been friendly and they've Bon on top of soda/water refills.",

    "text": "I initially heard about this place from a friend who mentioned oxtail chili cheese fries and I was immediately intrigued. Sadly, I couldn't eat it during that trip, so on my next Vegas trip, I decided to make a stop here before heading to the strip. Thank goodness this place closes late because I didn't think we'd make in time from LA. This would be the first time I tried a burger with Asian infused flavors.  Food: 1) Ronin Burger was good, but not spectacular. I enjoyed the Angus beef, caramelized onions, the gooey fried egg, and the crispy texture of the coleslaw. However, along with the Miso Goma, Yuzu and Citrus Aioli, it was too saucy and it had too much sweet flavor going on in a burger. I actually prefer a more savory rather than sweet flavor on a burger. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=V5kPRRaoHF6UCdwU-3-XWg#7CC4LhQgNIOvut_ilHgPEg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>  2) Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries tasted just like chili cheese fries. The chili was surprisingly light for chili. I could tell that there was a little bit of a difference in texture, but the flavor of the oxtail wasn't obvious. If it oxtail weren't mentioned in the name, I wouldn't have known that there was oxtail in there. There definitely wasn't a noticeable difference enough for me to spend that money on it. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=V5kPRRaoHF6UCdwU-3-XWg#i_RIwA6P6rcLwhxdKJVBBg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>  3) Truffle Fries were some of the best I've had, but the sauce was only drizzled on the top, so there definitely wasn't enough of it for the rest of the fries. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=V5kPRRaoHF6UCdwU-3-XWg#TcId2ISk5G8_x0SGno4Stw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>  Service: Our server was friendly; Food was brought out in a timely fashion; Refills were constantly given.",

Kiki burger: pretty tasty, had a nice sauce that made the burger stand out.   Truffle fries: they were okay, honestly I've tried better fries. Maybe I should have gone with the oxtail chili fries  The wait to sit was like 40 minutes, the wait for the food was about 20-25 I think. Don't come here super hungry. It would probably be better to have a snack first because you can get really grumpy after awhile.  Service: our waiter was pretty nice. They let us sit outside even though it seemed like the patio wasn't open. Other people were seated outside too after awhile.  The food was pretty good, but not spectacular. I think it's a place that people should try, but not somewhere I would visit often.",

You can read my previous review to hear about my experience trying out 4 different burgers and 3 different fries.   This was my first time ordering the spicy miso burger and it was absolutely delicious. It honestly puts the other burgers to shame as far as flavor goes. A spicy miso sauce that's placed on the patty and the whole thing is topped off with lettuce, onions, sauce, cheese and a fried egg! Seriously, miso and a fried egg? How can you go wrong with that? It was so delicious that from now on that is all that I'm going to order.   Also another plus is that Bachi Burger is open so late. They were open until 2am and the last call for food is at 1:45am. Bachi Burger is a must if you are in the Las Vegas area no matter what!   **They are also opening one up on West LA for all the socal people!",

The menu: at least at the time I am writing this they didn't have their menu online so we had no way to gauge it or see the prices. When we showed up we were shocked to find an overpriced a'lacarte menu. I'm talking $16 for a burger, $5 for fries, $4 for a drink. They sure are proud of these things, so I am expecting the best tasting food of my life. NOPE!   The food was underwhelming. It was not bad per se, but not even in the top 50 burgers of my life. Not to mention, the portions are actually small. $16 for a plate with a McDonald's sized burger and nothing else. No fries.  I was in a party of 5 and each person's food came out at different times, like 10 minutes apart.. So we basically got to watch each other eat. FAIL! Can't cook more than one plate at a time? WTF!?  The environment was nothing at all. Tvs on the wall that were OFF. I regret wasting our weekly restaurant visit at this place.",

    "text": "Celebrating for Spartan Race we wanted to reward ourselves. Assuming everything in The Strip would be packed for dinner we decided to try avoiding the chaos and thought Bachi Burger wouldn't be packed...we were semi-correct. A decent wait for some delicious food.  Ambiance:  * Parking | It is plaza parking so it is quite busy. * Seating | A fair amount of seating, about 50-70 people bar or group seating. * Feels | Typical restaurant feel with trance/electric music and definitely always crowded.  Food: Caramel Milkshake | Sweet and caramelly. The smoothie smoothly went through the straw and was enjoyable with every strip Red Velvet Milkshake | The concept of red velvet is overrate but even I gave in. No regrets delicious it was.  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries | Definitely a unique taste with the oxtail, egg, cheese and the additional appetizers. This is plentiful so do share. Truffle Parmesan Fries |  Typical yet delicious truffle parmesan fries. If you are in the mood for something lighter, go for this. Banh Mi Burger | Where to begin? The delicious mix of pork, shrimp and vinegar just to name a few made these american feel into a good asian fusion. Mr. Ho's Burger | The sausage and mushrooms were delicious, juicy, and had awesome texture.  Customer Service: * We waited for about 20-30 minutes. It's strange we walked us in and escorted us to the back patio to wait where we just sat and listened to trance/electric music. Other than that the servers were attentive and fixed my order when there was a problem, no charge!  Overall:  * 5 stars. A very unique burger place, I can't think of any place. The wait was fairly respectable and worth it. The customer service was excellent and the food was unforgettably delicious: the creative marinations and combinations of lemongrass, fish sauce, pickled vegetable just to name a few... I would definitely come back and try their other menu items. Till next time, Bachi Burger!  Advice: * Come during non-common business ours.",

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen ($10) and the broth was so tastey I didn't even want to add any seasoning. The ramen was really soft and fresh. Loved that the yolk in the egg was still oozing showed the freshness of the egg as well. Two pieces of pork in the soul and it was good but it was all fat.  Also ordered a burger ($15) (forgot the name) but it had onion rings and a sunny side egg in it an it was delicious! The patty is so soft and full of flavor.  The waitress forgot our oxtail fries but that's okay because we were stuffed.   Giant burgers can definitely share between two people with an appetizer. They don't skimp on the ramen bowl either!  Good portion, good price, tastey food!",

My favorite burger is the black and green (only because it's so good that I haven't ordered anything else), the wagyu grass fed beef, mushrooms, blue cheese and spinach blend together deliciously in your mouth. These burgers are pretty good sized. The buns are super soft, and the meat is really tender. With every bite you take, it just melts in your mouth.   We ordered the Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries. I really like the garlic chili aioli, but next time I'd like to try the Truffle Parmesan Fries.   Our neighbor ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and they looked amazing. The plate was huge, although there was only two and they finished the whole plate without issue. I think it's because they are that good.  The only thing average about this place was my iced tea.  It was just ok. I'm definitely a little picky about my iced tea, so I just wouldn't order it again here. Maybe next time I'll try the Matcha Green Tea instead.",

But I want to give a shoutout to the Filipino guy working as a hostess, busser and server. He made us laugh and all the servers took care of us tonight. They all were bussing their asses tonight because they were understaffed. And everyone knows you have to work extra hard to make customers happy when you have to pick up slack. Our food took a little longer then usual but they still delivered and food is always great here. With better management I think this place can pick themselves back up and become the excellent restaurant they were before! Salamat bachi burger!!!!",

Furniture is in need of repair too... tables had scuff marks and the bench along the wall near the back corner of restaurant had a broken board under the seats.

    "text": "I anxiously awaited my visit to Las Vegas, just so I could try Bachi Burger.  I had heard so much about it, and it was all good!   First of all, the location-  off the strip at the South end of town.  It was conveniently located just four short blocks away from our RV resort, which was quite welcome after already having driven about 5 1/2 hours to get to Vegas.    The restaurant :  Kinda hard to find the entrance, but once we did, we were seated without a wait.  We arrived at about 5:45 on a Thursday.  I was surprised at how small this place was.  It looks like it only seated about 50 people.  The environment was very industrial chic.  The food: ORGASMIC, MINDBLOWING, AMAZING!  O.K.  I think you get the picture.  I loved the food.  We started with the oxtail chili cheese fries.  These super crisp fries are topped with a fair amount of the delicious chili, cheese sauce, and a perfect sunny side up egg.   My son built his own burger with an angus patty, cheese, bacon, and crispy onion rings.  My husband and I shared the Miagi-son burger.  It had an angus beef patty, furikake seasoning, carmelized bacon, fried egg, and chili aoli.  It was great!  I of course enjoyed their house Chardonnay, and my husband enjoyed his icy cold (however a bit pricy) craft brew.",

I thought it would be an off time coming in but they were busy!  It must be a winner!  We decided to try a few different burgers and split them so we could taste a couple different things on the menu.  Our choices were the Kiki Burger and Spicy Miso Burger.   ~ the Kiki Burger had a fabulous blend of sauteed mushrooms, caramelized bacon and garlic chili aioli.  The flavorful bacon really stood out.  The buttery soft bun complimented this so perfect. The angus beef was absolutely cooked to perfection.  This burger is an A+!  ~the Spicy Miso burger was also such a delectable, mouth watering treat for my taste buds!  The unique combination of pepper mayo, onion, cheese and apple vinaigrette sent my world spinning!  Not to mention that they inserted a fried egg in between all of the other yummy ingredients.  WOW!!   On the side we went with the Truffle Parmesan and Sweet Potato Fries.  OH YEAH! They were crispy, full of flavor and served with a delicious dipping sauce.  This was great to change it up from the usual ketchup.   The truffle sauce gave the fries a different yet fabulous flavor with a hint of garlic taste.  Score!  The Sweet potato fries were just as delicious.  They were crispy and perfect with their chosen dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what this was but I was in heaven!   I can't write this review without mentioning the phenomenal service they provided!  Our waitress was attentive, so friendly and courteous! She even asked us if we had any food allergies that the kitchen should be aware of.  This was the first time anyone ever asked me this!  That's amazing to me!  Plus they had others walking around with water pitchers to refill our glasses even when they weren't even half gone!  All restaurants should do this!   Why did I wait to long to try Bachi Burger? Now that I know how delicious their food is, I hope not to wait so long for my second visit.  If you want a different flare of a burger flavor...  this is definitely the place to go!   Can you tell I loved it?",

A little extra crunchy and crispy than I would have wanted (We mistakenly thought it would be more crab cakey), but a solid choice if you aren't craving beef.  Again, if you come here, you gotta try the Oxtail fries.  It is True oxtail, and super delicious and tender.  This is the best Asian fusion style burger in town.  We will be back again!",

Hard to go wrong with Bachi Burger...Wahlburgers better step up their game when they come to town with places like this to compete with. :-)",

    "text": "I've only been there once and it was so good and original.  I got a burger that was pretty spicy but not slap you're mom spicy.  The thing i noticed about the burger was how juicy and tender it was, the best piece of hamburger patty i've eaten. EVER!!!  The assortment of fries were delicious, try them all. I liked their special sauce with them.   The one negative is the crowdedness and smallness of the joint.  They need to find a larger restaurant, it is so popular that you have to wait a long time and then you feel cramped sitting so close to strangers.  which could be a good thing if the strangers are attractive and don't have BO, but lets face it, most people have BO and i don't like to smell it in a restauarant, unless it's my own of course, my smell doesn't offend me.   Get a bigger restaurant, you're business will grow faster and you'll make more money, it is too popular to have a tiny, rinky dink area.",

    "text": "Well just by reviewing some of the reviews mine wont be any different. First the good news: As far a flavor Bachi Burger is definitely a hit. If you you wanna try a \"non-conventional\" American Burger this place holds True flavor. I've personally order the black & green burger and it was delicious. You can taste all the flavors described. I've added gruyere cheese which was good also. Now the service: Service I will give 1.5/5 on this one. List: 10mins to be seated, another 10mins to be greeted and order. 15mins to be servers my drink. 15mins later my fries come out , then another 10mins finally the burger. All together it took about 50 mins from arrival to eating. Oh and I only sat by myself with no parties. I can understand food needs time to cook to order, but I shouldn't have to wait 30 mins to finally be served a drink. I think that's kinda ridiculous for the amount of time to wait. I thinks it's really the lack of communication of the servers of the floor. One guy kept repeating \"I need all staff on the floor\" and no one seems to care. It looked like they were trying to look like the busy instead of tending to their customers. What a shame. Overall the experience needs some improvement. Food quality 5/5, Service 1.5/5 Overall 3/5. Sorry bout I hope the location on Russell has better service then this one.",

Made the process even more fun! I like to get individual flavors, as well as the combination.  The patty itself was fantastic! I really wanted fries, so I decided to order just the plain ones so I can really get the awesomenss of a good fry...and they did not disappoint. Crunchy, not too salty, and it comes with great homemade ketchup.  Love the vibe...great service...great food.  I will be a regular here.",

But today I guess I have experience the worst service that I have been in my life.. They have like 4 servers and a bartender serving only 4 tables and still have to wait like 10 mins to get you order, If I did not ask the server who is passing by probably I'll be there forever or decided to leave..Plus over cooked my burger from medium to well done.. Sucks huh? And how could it happen that the burger comes out first before the apps? What's the purpose of the menu and the staffs who does not know what are they doing? I'm not sure if its the chef or a cook who did come out and stare at me like I'm the one who did fucked up after I talked to my server regarding on the temp of my burger... I love this place but not coming back after what happened... It is just a burger and thats a burger place, that there is no other way to overtemp the burger that far",

That's sweet...but that's not why I came to Bachi! This is why I came:  \"Grilled to your desired temperature, our burgers are glazed and caramelized over an open flame using a proprietary soy, sake, and mirin-based marinade. The perfect crust is formed holding in a succulent specialized mix of ground Certified All-Natural Chuck and 21-day dry-aged ribeye\"...GOOD GOD!  Bachi Burger is located in a small strip mall on the south side of Vegas. Bachi is a decent sized joint with a chill, relaxing vibe.   The menu is made up of burgers, steamed buns, sandwiches and salads, all made with Asian inspired ingredients. My honey, Eugine Y, recommended Bachi to me and boy, my baby boy was right; it was SO worth the drive.  Since I don't make it to LV often, I went balls out at Bachi. This is what I ordered:  Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger- Chili mayo, fried egg, Furikake, caramelized bacon, & crispy onion rings <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=V5kPRRaoHF6UCdwU-3-XWg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN...</a>                  Mr. Ho's Burger- Angus beef & pork patty, green onions, cilantro ginger, garlic, Hoisin Mayo, Lup Cheong, sauteed mushrooms, mizuna & a TARO Bun  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=aMy63-xKofPONtJqkZTVqg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN...</a>    Ronin Burger- Caramelized onions, Japanese Cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ & Yuzu citrus aioli <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=buuw6JhKpiwkp5ShWAqGqg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN...</a>   Pork Belly Steamed Buns- Pork Belly, cilantro scallions, radish, boiled egg, Chinese black vinaigrette & five spice Hoisin BBQ sauce <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=dbB6j3SqnngaPORSemc2yw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN...</a>         Truffle Parmesan Fries- Parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=EI77DnK2YetftJkN_EnR0A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN...</a>  Dipping Sauces- Sun dried tomato aioli, pineapple ketchup, Yuzu citrus aioli & garlic chili aioli <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=dzbNYbrAZdjErCp-T5F8kw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN...</a>  Portuguese Donuts- Coffee ice cream <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=u4J7iFwsi2cqeHtoxfcCcg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN...</a>  Watermelon Milk Tea <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=M7ZF6_JdMOdCoDxqZnpfkA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN...</a>  We started with the pork belly buns and fries, both were amazing. The PB was so juicy and fatty and the steamed buns were perfect. The fries, because of all toppings, had an awesome taste. The dipping sauces were all tasty too. But the burgers.. oh their burgers were unlike any burger I've ever tasted. My taste buds were in a state of euphoric shock. The intense flavors made me smile from ear to ear. I can't begin to describe how phenomenal each burger was. The patties themselves were so juicy and each had a glaze on them that tasted fabulous. And the toppings... so good, so fresh.  The donuts for dessert were great and their watermelon milk tea was easily one the best milk teas I've ever had.   Prices here are great. Everything was surprisingly reasonably priced. The service was great as well. Each employee we spoke to loved to talk about their food and told us all about how things are made and so on.   Seriously, if I lived in LV I would be a regular here. I know I only visited Bachi once but I'm so ready to call it my all time favorite burger joint. It was amazing. Please, if you like burgers check it out. It's worth leaving the strip for. TRUST",

Our server came and checked on us without overly checking, which was great because we were too busy stuffing our faces! LOL we then finished off the meal with Portuguese doughnuts...the coffee ice cream was to die for. I can honestly say, THIS has been such a great food orgasmic experience that we will ALWAYS come here when we're in town! Thank you for the amazing food and service! An absolute must if your in town!",

I ended up trying the Miyagi-san Wagyu Burger, which simply put was impeccable. The beef was buttery, the addons were fantastic and every bite was a myriad of taste. I imagine every burger has this taste so I'm looking forward to subsequent visits. Also tried the truffle parmesan fries which were the perfect accompaniment. Service was a bit slower than what i expect from a casual place but it wasn't an inconvenience.  Finally, this location is off the regular path which was great as there was no line on a Saturday night. Overall, a great experience. Thanks Bachi!",

The strip mall locale is awesome.  Parking is easy.  Expect to wait but don't get itchy.  The wait is worth it.    Whatever you do, do not overlook the oxtail chili fries and don't order it expecting it to be an appetizer.  It's massive, heavy, full flavored, spicy, amazing.  This is a meal for two on its own.  So don't get a burger and the oxtail chili fries.  You can't eat it all.  So sit back and enjoy!     I went twice on the same trip, you have to have a rental if you're a tourist.  Cabs are expensive.  So rent a car and drive out here from whatever strip casino you are staying at.  It's so worth it.",

I had the pork belly on a steamed bun and ho-ly crap it was good!  Pork belly had great texture and rich flavors that were complimented by the warm, sweet steamed bun.  Our group shared an appetizer of the chili oxtail fries - huge order definitely for sharing.  My brother-in-law loved the Bachi fish!  Couple of bummers:  problem with the air conditioning - it was quite warm and uncomfortable - and when my wine was presented it was warm.  Others in my group ordered beer, and although it was cold it wasn't as cold as it should've been.  When I requested the wine be taken back and removed from the bill (I only had one small sip), I was told it wasn't possible to remove something from the bill once it's been added.  Huh?  Our waitress, Christy, was attentive and pleasant and offered a free ice tea while the wine was chilling in the refrigerator.  I appreciated the attempt to rectify, but am not pleased with the policy.  In the end, this was not a deal breaker and the quality of the food is great!  Hopefully the issue with the air conditioning will be fixed soon, and the beverages will be served at proper temp.  If that happens...  definitely 5 stars!",

One of our party had the ramen, waited to see if we got food, we told him to eat before it got cold and he slowly ate. He finished his meal before we got our food.

I love their creativity though! I'll still come here again, but it isn't the best I've ever had.   I ordered the oxtail fries with my family. This dish was the restaurant's saving grace for me. These fries were crisp and the chili was tasty and meaty! Sooooo incredibly good, but fries aren't supposed to be what makes a burger place.   I got the Kalbi Burger. I ordered my kimchi on the side since I wanted to avoid it overpowering my burger. I'm glad I did because that kimchi was disappointing to me. Their kimchi is too sweet in my opinion, not up my alley. The burger was alright. I really liked the soft bun, but the patty was just okaye. What I was impressed with were the size of the burgers, since all the pictures make the burgers look smaller than they really are. I was really full after I finished, but it was just an okay burger to me. Maybe everything just didn't come together for me because in writing this review, I feel like the burger sounds special and promising, but that's not really what I was left feeling.  The service was nice though! Every one was very quick to pick up any trash. The place was very clean even though it was so busy.   Eh, give it a try for yourself. It is worth a try.",

    "text": "Holy sweet Jesus, this is some good cow.  They proudly display a sign that says \"Voted Best Gourmet Burger in Vegas 2010\"---and rightfully so.  Bachi Burger takes the classic \"meat, bun, & veggie combination,\" adds a bit of an Asian twist to it, sprinkles on some magic dust, and voila! What you have is a kickass burger waiting for you to devour it.  With every Vegas trip I go on, I've been more than glad to come back here. Service has always been amazing--almost as amazing are their Sweet Potato Fries. Semi sweet, super crispy, extra delicious. Get these instead of the gravy-topped Truffle Fries and you won't be disappointed.  It's not listed on their current menu, but last time I went, I had the pleasure of trying an appetizer dish...I believe it was Seared Tuna with Chips....it was utterly delicious. The salty chips paired nicely with the silky fish. The Ronin Burger, Kiki Burger, and Spicy Miso are always good choices as the main course.  Next time (if the blackjack tables treat me a little better,) I'll opt for the Shogun Burger!",

When I want a burger, I want a burger with ketchup, mayo, mustard, tomatoes, onion, lettuce, and maybe an avocado.  But this place was nice. although I won't be getting any hankerings for the burgers here(personal preference) there is nothing bad about the food here. Not over salted or over seasoned the flavors are mellow and easy.  It's clean, staff is friendly, food is fresh, and they are creative.",

The atmosphere of the restaurant is your typical Japanese feeling, the dark flooring and walls, sushi bar seating, and asian decor on the walls.  I ordered the Spicy Miso Burger. This burger was not on their website menu, but I must say, if you know Asian Food it is all about presentation and it did not disappoint. Not only did the burger look good, but taste remarkable.  If you are into Burgers with a twist, I would recommend a visit.",

    "text": "So here goes my first review since I moved back to Vegas..... Bachi Burger failed to impress me the first time I was here almost 2 years ago. I was staying with a friend the other day who lived nearby and we decided to go here for a late night dinner.  I was extremely happy I decided to give this place another try. The food is amazing and the service was excellent. My buddy already went back last night to pick up food to go. I ordered the truffled parmasean garlic fries and the Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. My friend ordered the Chili Fried Chicken and Kiki's Burger. No complaints about any of the food. I was surprised at how good the Fried Chicken was. I wasn't a fan of the sauce served with the fries, but not a big deal.  The reason I don't give them 5 stars just yet is I'm still a bit disappointed in the length of time it takes for the food to come out when there is nobody else in the restaurant. It was much quicker than the first time I went (took 50 minutes then). But I guess good food is worth waiting for. Also, I still think they could improve the atmosphere of the place a bit. It still feels like a strange cross between a fast food joint and a sit down restaurant when they could be so much more. With food that good its a shame they are not busy all the time. Maybe it's the location, maybe its the atmosphere... I'm not sure.  Anyway, I look forward to going back to try more delicious burgers! Hopefully I can bump this up to 5 stars in the future. Another plus was that the manager had reached out to me and apologized for my poor experience the first time around. That was probably the main reason I gave them a second chance.",

The atmosphere was nice, we were seated almost immediately, water brought to the table promptly. The service was friendly and informative, the place was clean and the decor was very nice.   I got the Kalbi burger (I'm Korean, what do you expect?!), and I can't recall what the husband got, but he liked it.   The menu didn't say anything (as far as I could recall) about jalapenos in the order of fries we got to share (the boy is not a fan of spice), so that would have been good to know beforehand.   Overall, we had a good experience there. I would go back again when I am ready to pay that price for an individual burger, but it might be a while.   Oh, and it would have been nice to get a refill of water without having to wait more than 5 minutes with 2 empty glasses, especially with the surprise of the jalapenos.",

The buns were soft and sweet and it kind of reminded me of Hawaiian sweet bread/rolls. I liked the caramelized onions but they were too sweet.

The only thing that we weren't super happy with was the shishito peppers, we added them to the burger and couldn't tell that they were there. We should have ordered it on the side.  Since we didn't get the burger with the egg on it, we did get the Oxtail Chili Fries with the egg on top. It was really really good. The chili could have been a touch more flavorful, but overall it was super yummy!  We will definitely come back here the next time we are in Vegas, and you should too!",

Also, the buns are so fluffy and airy, it's just MAGICAL!   Banh Mi Burger: MY FAVORITE. This has all the flavors of a Vietnamese sandwich. The added flavors of the grilled pork and the pickled veggies really make this burger spectacular.   Salt and Pepper french fries: This is also a MUST ORDER. From the sounds of it, it just sounds like they'll throw salt and pepper on your french fries, but it's SO MUCH MORE! They also flavor the fries with fresh slices of jalapenos and little garlic chips. At frist sight, the fries look like they would be extremely spicy (which worried me since I can not tolerate much) but the flavors were PERFECT. Just enough kick to make you keep eating more and more! These flavors are very similiar to the Vietnamese dish: Tom Rang Muoi if you're familiar with that. You must try it for yourself.",

    "text": "Bachi Burger is a burger place with an asian fusion theme. I've been here once and the Summerlin location once. Ive tried 2 of their burgers: Miyagi-san Burger and the Banh Mi Burger. The Miyagi-san Burger was pretty good..wagyu beef, chili mayo, caramelized bacon, fried onion rings, fried egg, and furikake seasoning if i remember correctly. The crispy onion rings, gooey egg, and saltiness of the bacon matched really well. When I finished the burger, I thought I had like a \"loco moco\" version of a burger with onion rings (minus the gravy). The Banh Mi burger knocked it out of the park..shrimp and pork patty with nuoc mam (i think thats how its spelled?) sauce and pickled veges. This was probably the BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD. It got better with every bite. As I was eating it, I was intrigued that i was eating a burger but the flavors REALLY DID remind me of the banh mi sandwich (which makes u think of the french bread cut lengthwise and eating it hot dog style). The resto is also know for their oxtail fries which i will try on my next visit.   The resto has a nice, cozy feel with some tvs. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. The only thing I would have to say negative is the boba drinks are a little too pricey.  Overall, Bachi Burger is the best burger place I've been to since moving to Vegas.",

Maybe some older or more experienced waiters.  Our waitress literally walked off in the middle of us ordering or asking for something more than once.  So of course a few things were not correct the first time.  We asked for water (for the whole group, after we had been in need of refills for awhile, and no one ever asked if we needed anything the whole meal) and she came up and refilled ONE GLASS, with everyone clearly needing more water.  She was not friendly at all and she seemed very spaced out and sulky at the same time.  So if you come here, better order plenty of drinks in advance and be prepared to wait a long time for a table, and then wait a long time for food.  But the food was excellent.

There were plenty of open tables but my party of 2 was kept waiting for almost an hour. And then she sat a group of 4 that came in after us.    We were finally sat at a table that had been open for about 20 minutes right next to the people they sat before us. The waitress then came and said she would bring us water, we didn't ask for water but she made the gesture that was never fulfilled until we finally reminded her.  Once we ordered we really didn't see her again until it was time to boot us off the table.  She did make speedy walk bys murming something but she would be gone before we could respond.  The food...many tables were ordering the ox tail chili on top of fries with an egg.  Woooooo (sarcasm). From the looks and smell, there is a fry truck that makes a brisket poutine (which this basically was) far better.  I ordered a double Angus burger with fried onion rings (tempura style), bacon (because the waitress made excuses as to why they could not add pork belly from their bahns whoch lead to the conclusion that the bahns were premade) and swiss.  They also offer waygu (which I suspect is not True or if it is its for those who would ruin a perfectly fine piece of meat and doing the ungodly things they did to their burgers).  Basically they grill their meat, whichever one you ordered and basted the hell out of it with hoison sauce.  Which brings me back to why order a waygu burger and then cover the flavor with a hoison bbq sauce?   And my friend got the waygu, it was tough and when I asked how it was he said he liked it. How was the meat? I just taste the sauce.  The fries are run of the mill, but you can get the truffle ones for those eaters who succumb to those parlor tricks.  In the end Bachi Burger isn't the worst burger joint I have been to, but far from the better ones.  Most people will probably like it (like the group next to us whose buzz words were \"waygu\" and \"truffle oil\"), but they also like Ed Hardy shirts, think Mercedes-Benz are awesome cars, and have rocked out to \"What Does The Fox Say\".",

    "text": "This place has a lot of potential.  I agree with Keith - odd location with entrance at the back of the place away from the street.  Ambiance is nice, simple, but too dark even with natural light.  My pics that I will post are dark.  Obviously being open a week, they have some kinks to work out.  This probably would have been a three-star deal if they had \"been around\" awhile.  I ordered iced matcha tea (unlimited, but still $3) and it was very grassy and delicious, like the one at Yokohama Kaigenro.  Refilled a lot.  I contemplated those steamed bun sandwiches but wanted to try a burger since it is in the name.  I got the Ronin (miso-sesame glazed burger, Japanese slaw, fried egg, caramelized onion, katsu bbq), a side of shishito peppers, and sweet potato fries with kaffir lime salt and yuzu aioli.  Boyfriend got the kiki's burger: sauteed mushrooms, onion marmalade, gruyere, caramelized bacon, garlic chili aioli.  He also got bubble tea strawberry-mango shake.  We got the fries first - crisp, sweet, hardly any kaffir lime flavor, but love the yuzu aioli.  Here is where we experienced a moment of weakness.  We get our burgers and mine has bacon - his doesn't.  I had made it very clear to the waitress that I don't eat pork when I asked for her suggestions.  So my burger had to be remade, and Eric asked for a side of bacon since his didn't have it and it was supposed to.  He was done with his before I got mine.  The owner (brother of the chef) came out and apologized, and that's fine - first week stuff getting worked out (the register put I ordered bacon when I ordered peppers (P/B mix up) and they just forgot his entirely).  My burger ended up being intensely juicy and flavorful, and the egg yolk perfectly runny, and the peppers were grilled with no annoying oil or salt all over them.  Our waitress seemed antsy and was constantly trying to take away plates and drinks while we were still eating and drinking, so it got annoying.  We also had to ask for napkins and silverware once we got food.  They were kind enough to give me a to go cup of matcha iced tea.  (I am used to this royal treatment at Blue Fin).  We split the bill but they do not duplicate credit card receipts - they just do merchant copies only, so we had to ask for duplicate copies of the main bill.   I will wait a while to go back so they can get their rhythm, but then I will try a duck or short rib steamed bun sandwich for sure!!  UPDATE: YUZU-CHERRY soda!!!",

The hostess is always frazzled, and tries her best to discourage customers by telling them \"it will be over an hour wait, and then it will take over an hour to get your food. We have another location in Summerlin, you should go there instead.\" She went through this song and dance with me and several other customers who had to interrupt her narrative and ask her to simply place our names on the waitlist. She was irritated by this and it showed.  We go to Bachi for the unique burger combinations, but the customer service needs an overhaul...perhaps a new hostess with customer service skills would help. I don't know if we'll return. Too many other burger places to try out that actually WANT customers in their restaurant. If you go here, try the oxtail fries, Burgers (shogun, miso, calbee), bachi fish.",

Amazing flavor in just one bite, but if you're not a fan of sweet food this burger is not for you.  Mr Miyagi - Husband loved this burger. Perfectly cooked and seasoned and not sweet. I love the crispy onions on it.  Truffle fries - the bomb! I've had truffle fries before but this is the best truffle fries I've ever had.  I'm glad they're opening a branch in Los Angeles in 2013.

Communication was more clear this time with their team and was apparent in servicing guests.  Had the Kiki Burger was was awesome.  If you don't like mushrooms, then this is not for you.  Flavoring of the garlic aioli, mushrooms, and bacon were perfect.  My husband had the Spicy Miso burger (topped with egg) which is more of his preference.  We had regular fries, which we could share.  On previous occasions we tried the sweet potato fries and parmesan fries.  All are great accompaniments.  A group could fit; however, this location is fairly small in size, so if it was busy expect a long wait.  Total before tax came to $27 for two burgers a one fries. Hopefully that will help you gauge what to expect for prices.",

On this particular trip I had:  Miyagi-San Burger -- This probably my favorite burger here. Wagyu grass feed beef, topped with a friend eggs, onion rings, and caramelized bacon. It also has a wonderful sweet glaze on the patty. Delicious!!  Kiki's Burger -- Also a great burger! I was trying to eat something a little healthier so a friend and I did halfsies on the Kiki and the Myagi-San. The Kiki is topped with caramelized ones and an array of mushrooms.  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries -- These chili cheese fries are great. Oxtail chili served a top fries with Cheese, fried egg and jalapenos. These are always so yummy, but probably not too healthy to eat too often. Our table shared one order, but I can definitely eat the entire thing myself.  Now for the best part of my review (drum roll please)..............  After having spoke to the owner it turns out Bachi Burger is coming to LA!!! I was very excited to hear this. My friends and I have been talking about how great it would be if Bachi were closer. Expect them to open up sometime in the fall. I can't wait! I better start buying my pants one size larger, because I'm going to need them. =P",

After checking out the menu we settled on the \"Miyagi-san Grass Feed Waygu Burger which consisted of the following...  Chili Mao Fried Egg Furikake Caramelized Bacon Crispy Onion Rings  This was to be accompanied by an appetizer that would substitute the side fries we would have to order. That consisted of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.  That was made with...  Fries Cheese Chili Garlic Aioli and a Fried Egg.  After having ordered...I noticed that there was a board posting the daily specials...I was sad that this was not brought to my attention prior to ordering.  The Boy drank one Root Beer and I had a very delicious Plantation Sweet Tea.  After consuming the above items, I found them to be OK and not worth hating or truly loving.  The service was awesome as I think I must have seen at least five different faces that checked in to see how things were going.    The real ball buster was the check. Granted this is not some trendy joke joint up on the strip it on Windmill and Bermuda for Christ sake's..but the total was why was basically two burgers, one fries w/ toppings and two drinks was $51.89 without tip...I digress we also got a Peanut Butter and Chocolate shack too. $51.89!",

On our way there we received a call from them that it's already is ready which is great & was a pretty quick for a service. The food was pretty pricey not going to lie but it worths it. The patty has been seasoned so well tasted like a different way of kbbq. I got the Kalbi and his was a Kiki. We got oxtail fries but it wasn't as great maybe I'm just not a fan but it's ok.

    "text": "Stop what you're doing and get a burger from here. All burgers here are made from wagyu beef. For those who dont know, Wagyu refers to several breeds of cattle bred for intense marbling and producing a high percentage of rich unsaturated fat. Basically this beef is high quality AF.  First of all, the restaurant is usually busy. So you may need to wait 10-30 minutes. BUT it's worth the wait. The staff is friendly, cleanliness is spot on, and the ambiance is casual. Enough with the basics, let's talk about the food.  I got the Banh mi burger. Under the bun is a patty made of Angus beef, pork and shrimp, topped with a thin slice of grilled pork pate, crisp lettuce and hints of lemongrass, herbs and curry aioli. On the side is are pickled slivers of carrot and daikon radish, with jalapeno slices and a shallow bowl of nuoc mam, a sweet sauce with a marmalade tang and a hint of garlic. The burger was very juicy, and \"fluffy\" if that's even a right term to describe it's texture. Basically the burger is cooked right, not too tough, and very meaty. It tasted really good, perfect for your inner carnivore. The burger is delicious and filling,  enough said. The fries are meh. Their tough and barely salted. It's the sauces you get with them that makes them good.  A great place to go too. Will be back again.",

We needed to head back to OC sooner than that on a Sunday evening, so unfortunately we didn't get to try it out until Cinco de Mayo/Fight Night weekend 2014. We went straight there upon arrival in Vegas around 10PM-11PM. My boyfriend was certain he spotted professional boxer Mickey Bey enjoying a post-fight burger...  A couple of us ordered Hitachino beers imported from Japan. At $9 each, I could have done without it since the burger was actually pretty filling. But when in Rome/Vegas, right? The Real Ginger Brew was light and refreshing, but not the most outstanding ginger beer I've ever had. I'm just glad that it was 8% ABV.  My boyfriend ordered Sweet Potato Fries $4.50 done Truffle Parmesean style for an extra $1. It was seasoned with sea salt and came with yuzu citrus aioli. He definitely couldn't finish them, so if you are very hungry it is a good value for an appetizer.  He also ordered the Banh-Mi Burger $11, a Vietnamese-style burger. It definitely tasted the way a Vietnamese banh mi sandwich would taste in delicious, beefy, burger form.  I ordered the Kiki's Burger $11 with a fried egg for an additional $1.50. I was very satisfied with this burger because it was a spicy and sweet tastebud party, but I could have done without the egg. Our server was talking it up, I feel like maybe he was just upselling me on the beer and the egg (tips for higher tax/tips haha). There was plenty of bacon, but of course I saved it for my last bite. I would definitely order this burger again, sans fried egg.  The buns at Bachi Burger are extremely fluffy, but once you start eating it will flatten out. Overall, the food is delicious and made with good quality ingredients. I am looking forward to the next time I come to Vegas for another yummy, fluffy-bunned fusion burger!",

We also split the Kiki  burger, which is topped with a garlic chili aioli, caramelized bacon, sauteed shitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, a sweet onion marmalade and melted Gruyere cheese. The burger is glazed with a delicious coating and came together beautifully.   The food was so good, I was still thinking about it the next day and craving more.

I am only rating this a 3 because of past great visits,  last night would be a 1 star visit if that.  We were seated at 5:55, waitress arrived at 5:58, I asked about the drink specials and she replied \"none\".  I knew happy hour ended at 6 so we pointed that out, her response was \"It is only a dollar off\" with an attitude.  If I had been alone I would have walked out but my daughter and her boyfriend were visiting and wanted Bachi.  At the very least I should have asked for a different server.  They ordered drinks anyway after showing the time to the waitress but I declined due to not feeling in the mood anymore plus I did not want to tip her more than I needed to.  I don't know if it was her attitude or if something was done on purpose, but our burgers were mediocre for the first time ever, and there were black hairs in our fries which we sent back.  Very disappointed and I'm not sure if we would ever go back, which is a shame because it was a favorite for sure.  I should have insisted that we just leave and go up the block to Steiners, they are always fantastic there and no attitudes.  Yes we still left a 20 percent tip because my daughter is a waitress and we know how hard the work is, but I sure did not want to.",

Everything we had here was made to perfection - the ox tail fries with fried egg on top,  Ronin burger (my personal fav) and the Shogun (foie gras any one?!).  The burger was cooked to perfect medium rare which made it juicy.  I ate everything on my plate and dug into my god daughter's salt/pepper fries with jalepenos.  OMG, my mouth is watering just thinking about our heavenly meal.",

Service was pretty good - food was ok...had the oxtail chili cheese fries, more chili than oxtail.  We both had Mr. Ho's burger but it was too sweet and our burgers were under done as we asked for Med-well which is slight pink but it was more medium.  Taro bun wasn't fresh it was almost crispy.  Nothing id rush back for but worth it to try if you never did.",

So still why the terrible review...its courtesy especially when eating with people you havent seen in quite some time to wait for all the food to arrive at the table to begin chowing...2 of our parties food took 30 minutes later than everyone else's to come out. appetizers came in too fast which were fantastic (sweet potato fries) huge gap in between that and the entree. the waitress kept telling us the kitchen was behind and that the burger was being made. 10 minutes later she told us that they forgot the order. finally after 30 minutes the burger comes out. i dont care how many orders you have, the next burger should have been ours but no...we watched tables come in and sit down and get their food faster.  when coming to visit vegas, my friend told me this place was great and he wanted to try it. sadly i was a little disappointed not by the food. but its not always bad food that ruins the experience.",

It was like they combined pork egg rolls and a burger in one meal.  They feature a decent selection of beers and the fries are rather fun and tasty.  What keeps me from giving Bachi Burger five stars is the crazy layout.  You enter the restaurant from what seems like the back, rather than the door closer to the main road.  This was rather confusing and at first had me thinking the restaurant was closed!",

My least favorite is the banh mi burger.  I've been here at least 10 times and have never been disappointed. However, I've never been satisfied with their  2-star service. It started with the hostess who seems upset we showed up. Not even a smile or a greeting. Whenever we go there, the servers always look unhappy.......maybe they should quit and find a happier place to work at. Otherwise, this would have been a 5-star rating.",

After flagging down a waiter for menus, he just handed them to us and walked away.  No one ever spoke to us after being seated for 20 minutes!  Boom...one star review.  Fast forward 3 months.  Decided to give the place another shot.  Took my Mom here for her birthday dinner (ironic, since my 1st visit was supposed to be MY birthday dinner).  We went on a Wed. night at about 7pm.  The place was pretty busy, but we were seated right away.  Our server was AMAZING!!!!  He immediately brought us drinks, (I got the house made strawberry peach soda-excellent!!) explained the menu and made some great suggestions.  After much contemplation, we got the Parmesan Truffle Fries, the Pork Belly Sliders and I got the Kiki Burger while my mom got the Kalbi burger.   It was all sooo good!  There wasn't any food to wrap up.  We ate every last crumb!  The sliders came with this great house made hoisin sauce that made something good even better.  The Kalbi burger was spicy, but in the best way possible. My Kiki burger was sweet like carmelized BBQ.  I cannot wait to go back to this place. I am so happy I gave it another chance.  Hooray!!  Original Review:  Worst service EVER! Upon entering at 4:45 pm, there was no host for several minutes. The entire staff seemed very confused and  uncoordinated.  When a host finally showed up, we were told it would be a few minutes despite there being several open tables in sight. After being seated, we sat for 10 minutes with no one even making eye contact with us. I finally physically flagged a waiter down & asked for menus. He replied with \"yeah\"? and when I asked for the menu he gave them to us & walked away. No apology, no anything. After another 15 minutes of being completely ignored, we got up & left. When we left, their waiting area was packed with very unhappy looking people waiting to be seated,  There were still lots of tables available, but no one getting served.  We went 10 minutes down the road & had a fantastic dinner with excellent service at a tapas restaurant. By the way, this was my birthday dinner. I had chosen Bachi burger b/c I had heard such great things. What a disappointment. We will not be returning. Thanks for nothing Bachi burger.  Get it together!",

    "text": "No matter how much I pretend to not be a burger person, every time my friends want to go to one of these joints, I end up enjoying myself. There is always a stigma that burgers and fries are unhealthy. I won't try to refute it, but you can learn to overlook it for a great piece of Americana especially when you spice it up with an international twist.   The interior of this place resembles that of an industrial art gallery. The mute walls are complimented with bright splashes of  Asian photography. The numerous lights above you do not flood the area with an obnoxious florescent feel, but emanates enough light to make it feel cozy. The earth tone place mates gives a warm contrast to the otherwise concrete room.  Did you know that I was on a search for the perfect balls? Yes, they serve boba tea here and I am impressed. The tapioca were smaller than I am used to, but they have the right amount of chewiness, so they did not turn into spitballs. The taro milk tea was perfect; the richness of the taro, the creaminess of the milk, and the right amount of sweetness. My friend ordered the jasmine milk tea. I normally tend to avoid plain milk teas because the tea tend to go M.I.A. Not the case here. The jasmine is ever present and bold. Flowery and aromatic, I would order this again. If they had durian, I would be here more often. For $3.50, I can come here to get my boba fix and save the gas money. Who am I kidding? I would end up in Chinatown anyways.  I walked in, expecting to get gouged, but found their prices reasonable. My dining partner and I split a Ronin burger and a Kiki burger. The meat used in these patties are moist and flavorful. The thick slabs of meat were definitely the star, but let the accoutrement boost it up. The Ronin burger is topped with an Asian slaw, fried egg, and pickled ginger. When I first bit into it, I was thrown off, and taken aback. The ginger can be off putting, but after the second bite it got better. By the time you had a few bites it is delicious. This burger is messy because the egg is over easy and the yolk will burst when you pick it up. The Kiki burger was perfection from the first taste. The mixed greens, bacon, and sauteed onions did not distract nor overpower the burger. The BBQ sauce did not mask any imperfections, but bound everything together. With an order of sweet potato fries this was a magnificent meal even for the \"indifferent\" burger consumer I pretend to be.",

We ordered the kimchi burger, Caesar salad, oxtail cheese fries, and peking duck sliders.  Let me say the oxtail cheese fries were probably the best fries I ever tasted.  I am not a huge fan of fries but with the added chili sauce and cheese, it was heavenly.  The portion was generous too.  Then the kimchi burger came afterwards.  Super juicy and tender.  The marinade in the patty made all the difference.  The sliders were okay and the Caesar salad was a unique blend topped with a slice of anchovy.  Overall will recommend to anyone who happens to be in Vegas.",

Ever since they changed out their old staff, the new staff is horrible. Not so much of rude but just lack of customer service or inexperienced. I think they try to hard to be a little fancy or proper but it just ain't happening in this joint.   However, on a more recent visit, I dined in with my husband and infant (brought him in with his car seat) and totally forgot about the sucky service! The host walked us to our table and kindly brought over a high chair for my baby. He then flipped it upside down and said for us to place baby's car seat on there. My husband and I didn't agree with putting out baby (or his car seat) on the bottom of the dirty high chair where it's been dragging all over the ground. So I asked if we can just have another chair AND the response he gave me was baffling! He said, \"So you're OK with putting your baby on a chair where he can fall?!?!\" Yes, you'r damn skippy, I gave him the dirtiest look AND he was lucky I kept my mouth shut. I replied, \"yes and smiled (while doing whatever possible to put my baby's car seat on the chair the safest way possible).\" Seriously, am I that stupid to just put an unsteady car seat on a chair. Anyway, point being, he should've just it to himself.   So after this experience... I don't know if I will be going back unless I really have to! I'd rather go to the Summerlin location, nice staff (a little slow) and less crowded.",

Too thick in my opinion.  The buns were moist and not that wet where it would break apart easily.   I'm not sure what's the big deal with the fries. It's something different I guess since it's ox tail chili? They use thin fries for this dish which was crispy and I like.  I shared the spicy miso burger with my friend.

    "text": "Let me first begin by saying I wanted to love Bachi Burger, but the food is not worth the wait.  When we walked in on Sunday afternoon they were busy and we had a five minute wait while they cleaned a table. When we sat down, our waiter brought us some water and didn't come back for another 10 minutes.   By the time our waiter came back almost everyone around us had their food and were almost finished.  We ordered and waited another 35-40 minutes for food without anyone checking on us. We then noticed people who were seated after us received their food before us.  We were hoping the food was going to be so yummy but it was disappointing.  My boyfriend order chili fries and they were cold. Although Bachi has unique burger combos, they aren't the best burger ever.  Of course we waited another 10 minutes after we were finished before any waiter came around so we could stop them for a check.  If you're really hungry, want food fairly quickly or are on time crunch, don't come here.",

For 3 of us with burgers and an appetizer was almost $80  For additional dressing for a salad was an extra .50 cents.   Burgers were average at best. Customer service was horrible. Will not be coming back again",

    "text": "My visits at restaurants featured on Food Network typically translate into unpleasant experiences. Bachi Burger, though, is one of the rare exceptions.   After arriving in Las Vegas, we were famished and decided on Bachi. It was actually quite premeditated, to be honest. Needless to say, we walked right in, at just the right time before the impending rush, and snagged a table.   Bachi offers some of the most inventive burgers imaginable. I sat for at least ten or so minutes agonizing over what to select. Finally, after drooling all over the table, I decided on Kiki's Burger, an Angus beef construction of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, an onion marmalade, and Gruyere cheese. My thought process was that the Gruyere would offer a nice balance to the sweetness of the marmalade. Unfortunately, it didn't function like I hoped it would; the burger was much too sweet for my liking. To Bachi's credit, they did cook it to a perfect medium. I don't fault them for my reaction to the burger -- it was just a miscalculation on my part. Next time, I'll be sure to select a burger that is made up of mostly savory ingredients.   Visiting Bachi without also trying the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries would be very unfortunate. Not your typical chili cheese fry dish, to be certain. In fact, it's more like an oxtail poutine. It arrives served with a fried egg on top that you are left to bust open so that all the yoke smothers the pile of potatoes. It's also lightly accented by a few jalapenos and chopped cilantro to give it a little heat. Indeed, it was my favorite part of the Bachi experience and will surely make anyone come back for more.  I agree that a San Diego location would be a welcomed addition. Please??",

My daughter had seen Bachi Burger on one of her favorite shows, \"Drive Inns, Diners, and Dives, and had eaten there before. She was right it was amazing!  We went all out getting the calamari appetizer- very nice, the Duck Bun Rolls yummy, and I had burger that has the same last name as the instructor in the Karate Kid, crazy good!  My daughter had the burger that was a ground combo of high end beef, pork, and shrimp- also a hit.   Our waiter was great, and the only reason I did not give it five stars is it is not cheap. This definitely isn't your Carl's Jr. $6 Burger.  But for a special treat, it's fantastic!",

They were able to accomodate my group of 20 at midnight on a Saturday no problem. Like the Asian themed burgers. Sorta reminds me of Umami burger but over there they serve sliders, they serve full size burgers here. House music plays all night long.   *SHOGUN BURGER (5/5)- $26. Wagyu Beef x Unagi x Seared Foie Gras x Poached Asian Pear x Miso Butter. Had me lickin my fingers like I was eating some fried chicken. Maybe it's because I haven't had foie in so long since it's been banned in Cali but the burger was...... So rich. So lucious. So much umami flavor. So good. The juicy wagyu patty was cooked to order and had that distinct flavor.

Burger mah sit sso yo!   *SPICY MISO BURGER (4.25)  $10  Still gotta knock Japan off my bucket list, but this tastes like something you'd get from there. The burger is huuuuge.   *OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES (3/5) $12  Good spice to the chili and I like the jalapenos but we were shorted on the oxtail. There was probably a few strands of tail in there. As good as it sounds, I'd recommend not ordering it. Truffle fries (3/5 - $4)  were OK. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=WiPeDnnQ-i-6y1Z_2UtEkg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>)  *RED VELVET and SALTY CARAMEL MILKSHAKES (4.5/5)  $6 ea.  Order these! Wish there was more but I really liked how it was sorta melted so you could drink the shake. Tastes as advertised.

You get sleepy, getting that -itis, and you can't breath because you're wearing skinny jeans and all you wanna do is lay down wherever you are.  But the next day, you look back and wanna do it all over again.  Yes it's amazing!  I tried out that Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger and immediately thanked the cow that sacrificed their efforts to complete my happiness.  Pure joy I tell you.    But it was the Oxtail chili cheese fries that put me over the \"unbutton my jeans and unzip my zipper\" line.

And why would I get wagyu beef if I can't taste it over the different sauces cheeses fried things brioche slaw blah blah piled high on top of it? It doesn't make sense to me.  Perhaps as inventive and novel as BB tries to be, the conscious creativity effort undercuts the taste and inadvertently over promises under delivers flavorwise. Good food styling though.",

Our waiter, Hector, was a pretty chill dude he was attentive to our needs. We got to ordering and we decided to stsrt off with an appetizer, Oxtail chili cheese fries, and they were DELICIOUS!! They had great flavor and everything it had complemented each other nicely. For our main courses we got the Kikis burger and Miyagi san burger with a side of Truffle parmesian fries and all of that did not disappoint. Went in with an empty stomach came out feeling 50 pounds heavier, in a good way, great first experience here and definetely not the last.

This time I ordered the Miyagi-san Wagyu burger. I ordered it medium, cut it in half, and the first half I had was amazing! Perfect flavors with the meat, onion rings, egg, and furikake. The second half, however, went from medium well to over cooked pretty much. Disappointing...how did they cook a single patty two ways? Ha eh...made my taste buds feel yucky. Wish I ate that cooked side first. But it was still good.   Two other friends and I shared the Oxtail chili cheese fries as an appetizer. It turns out it was a good thing the fries came out way before the burgers because I don't think we would have finished it all if it didn't. They were so tasty!   I'm definitely gonna come back next time I'm in Vegas. Hopefully next time my burger will be medium all the way.",

Our server took over 15 minutes to greet us, I had to literally pull aside someone and ask them to get our server. After we ordered he came back 10 minutes later to tell us they couldn't even make the drinks we ordered. After reordering it took 15 min for the drinks to come and another 45 for our food. Our fry appetizer never came. And my ramen came out with meat in it after I had asked for no meat. I had to find our server once again to order another round and ask for the check. At this point he told us he would take care of our drinks and the fries. When I got the bill the fries and drinks were still on there so I had to ask him to remove it. He then removed it and ran our bill and came back with our friends boxed up. That would have been an hour fifteen minutes waiting for the fries at that point. Our server only had a 4 table section too so he couldn't have been that busy. Also no manger ever was seen on the floor.   I also found out the next day they were on Vegas dirty dining for having cockroaches everywhere so after both those things I won't be returning.",

    "text": "Really great burgers with a pan-Asian flavor profile.  That's what most people come here for and won't be disappointed.  The Kiki and the Ronin are my favorites.  For me, the egg on the Ronin is unnecessary and I go without it.  One great feature of their burgers is the crust they develop on one side - really nicely browned and delicious beefiness.   Lots of people get fries with their burger.  The fries themselves are well-cooked (previously frozen) spuds with some interesting flavorings and dipping sauces.  The only one to avoid is the \"salt and peppers garlic...\" which, to me, tasted like it had way too much lemongrass in it.  Stick with the standard fries or the truffle ones and you'll be happy.   Don't forget the appetizers!  The pickles are unusual (good unusual) if you are wanting an adventure, the edamame is excellent, and the fried calamari are among the best you can find anywhere (and you can eat the fried lemons that come with it).  The ramen here is really good too.  Amazingly, perhaps more filling than their burgers.  Lastly, the service.  It is friendly and a bit on the leisurely side.  But, they tend to leave you alone to have a good time.",

I got the Miyagi-San burger while my girlfriend got the Ronin burger and while they were both delicious, it was a little too oily and the buns struggled to keep it together.

Parking isn't really an issue as its lot has plenty of room. I highly recommend this place especially after a night out because: one, it's on the way back to California (if headed that direction) and two, it's pretty heavy (good for hangovers)",

The patty was cooked perfectly, just slightly pink in the center, and soo very juicy.  Me and hubby split the kalbi and the banh mi burger.  The kalbi tasted exactly like what kalbi beef should taste like, with just a tad of kimchi, but in burger form.  The banh mi tasted exactly like what I would expect from a vietnamese sandwich except again, in burger form.  Who knew that asian inspired burgers can taste soo good.  Then there's the truffle parmesan fries.  I actually got a little upset at my DH over this.  We had ordered only one order, and he kept eating them all while I was still eating my burgers.  Towards the end,  I just stared at him stuffing his face and told him that I will no longer fight with him for the fries. Next time we would just order our own.",

    "text": "I've come to this place several times now and I must say, I've been satisfied everytime.  I'd like to think of myself as an old-fashioned burger guy or purist, meaning I like to let the burger, cheese, and ketchup do the talking.  I'm fine with lettuce, tomato, fried onions, and at times, mushrooms and bacon.  I think having too much condiments and toppings ruins or hides the real flavor of the meat and cheese.  Having said that, I didn't think I would like this place too much as other burger fusion places I have tried before were just ok, but was open to trying Bachi burger out.  I have tried several of their burgers and I must say, all are good, though I have my favorites.  My favorite is the kiki burger.  I think most of their burgers at this restaurant tend to be on the sweet side.  Initially, I didn't like this burger much because of the sweetness, but when I put the aioli sauce on it, everything just came together.   The salty taste that I like came from the aioli sauce and just brought the flavoring and ingredients all together.  This burger is what I would recommend for everyone to try first.  It is not too far off the classic ingredients of a burger, I think.  Note, I'm not going to describe the burger toppings too much, as there are better reviewers before me that have described the specifics.  You can also look up the menu at bachi burgers' website   The second burger on my list is the banh mi burger, which has a Vietnamese flare.  Again, their sauce just brings their fusion idea all together.  Yum Yum.  I would definitely pick this if I'm not up for the kiki burger that day.  The other burgers I've tried are the Kalbi burger and Mr. Ho's burger.  These burgers are fine.  All in all, I think it just depends on what kind of fusion burger you are in the mood for during that time.  If you are wanting something with a little Vietnamese taste, go with the Banh mi burger.  If you want a hint of Korean, go with the Kalbi burger.    Others in my party have tried the American Wagyu burger and the Ronin burger.  They liked these as well. The buns on these burgers are soft and really good.  Also, I have tried the steamed sandwiches, such as the duck and pork belly sandwiches.  These are great.  Their sausage appetizers are pretty good.  We order this for our little one all the time.  Their fries are awesome too, especially the truffle fries.     This place definitely has a good vibe and the waiters/waitresses are friendly.  It does get busy at times, so you may want to get their by 1130 for lunch or arrive on earlier dinner times (6??).    Whenever I have guests from out of town and are in the mood for burgers, I definitely recommend this place.  I do give them a heads up it takes a little while for the burgers to cook, so their expectations for a little wait are set.  The good thing is that they have TVs that you can watch while you wait, if you're not chatting with your friends.  It's always tuned to the cooking or food channel, so there's a chance you will get hungrier, while you wait.  It makes the food even better when it arrives and you take your first bites.  So far, I think everyone leaves satisfied and happy like I am.",

    "text": "I came to Bachi Burger after seeing many great reviews, and some not so great reviews.  Bachi Burger proved to be a great restaurant, with very unique features that make it better than the average restaurant.   I actually went out on a limb and took some friends from out of town to Bachi Burger to show them some unique, but still familiar food in Las Vegas.   We started with the sausage plate, fried chili chicken, and the truffl-parmesan fries.  The sausage plate had two types of sausage, both good, but not great; one of the sausages made from kurobuta pork.  Both had great texture, but the flavor was good, but very traditional.  The fried chili chicken was the best appetizer we had, and the chili-garlic sauce was what made it so special.  The chicken was lightly breaded, fried, and coated with a light chili sauce.  The sauce was a little spicy, but the dominant flavor is toasted garlic.  The truffle-parmesan fries were very good, and were served with a porcini mushroom cream on top.  It is also served with a creamy dipping sauce that is very good.  Maybe a little more truffle would have made it better, but the fries were very good nonetheless.    For entrees, we had the Rhonin Burger, the Kiki Burger, and the Steamed Duck Buns.   The Rhonin Burger was very good, served with a soy glaze, asian style cole slaw, and a very good yuzu-citrus aioli.  The yuzu aioli made this very unique, and brought great acidity to the burger, balancing the boldness of the soy.    The Kiki Burger was the best thing, served with two types of mushrooms, and a garlic-chile aioli.  This was the best overall because it worked best together as a burger.  Each bite had layers of flavor, and got better each bite.   The Steamed Duck Buns were also very good, with the Duck being the highlight of this dish.  The Duck was very moist and flavorful, and worked well with the five-spice hoi sin, boiled egg, and soft steamed buns.   We tried the Junmai cold sake, and was very impressed with how it went with the food.  Red wine would also go very well with the burgers, and they said that they will serve it very soon.  The thai iced tea was pretty good, but the texture seemed watered down.  A very minor flaw in a overall great meal.   For dessert, we got the Walnut Bread Puding, which was served hot, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  They said they had their own pastry chef make everything fresh daily, and you could tell.  The bread pudding was soft, and very flavorful, and worked perfect with the crunch of the toasted walnuts.  Great dish! Overall, the flavors that Bachi Burger has in all of the dishes we had were very unique, and worked perfectly.  It is very affordable for the food you get, and it a must try for anyone who lives in Las Vegas.",

We began with the Bachi Pickles, an assortment of eight different types of pickles, all handmade and very delicious. We had the Sweet Potato Fries dusted with sea salt served up with Yuzu Citrus Aioli dipping sauce, a delicious match. Each of us ordered a burger - think of your juiciest most succulent backyard barbecue burger ever taking a quick trip to Japan and stopping off in Hawaii on the way back, and you have all the wonderful influences that make Bachi Burgers so wonderful. I ordered the Kiki Burger: 5 ounces (1/3 lb) of thick, juicy, tender, delicious Texas Kobe beef topped with caramelized bacon, Gruyere cheese, sweet onion marmalade, very tiny petite mushrooms and tender fresh cool greens, served on a warm bun. My dining partner enjoyed a Signature BBQ Bachi Burger, a tender 5 oz Angus Beef burger served up on a warm steamed bun with crispy cool lettuce, a thick slice of ripe tomato and thin slice of raw onion. Everything was better than we dreamed it would be! We look forward to our next visit.",

    "text": "In Las Vegas from Feb 3 to Feb 6, 2011.  Via yelp reviews, I wanted to give Bachi a try and I am glad I did, and actually ate at Bachie twice during my Vegas getaway.  Arrived las vegas on Thursday Feb 3, grabbed a rental car and first stop was Bachi as it is somewhat near the rental car facility.  Ordered the Banh Mi burger, salt n pepper fries and ice tea.  Burger 9/10 - nicely compose burger, great flavor!  Salt n pepper fries, 9/10 spot on, perfect, blends nice with the burger.  Ice Tea - The barley tea is usually good, had a least 3 glasses, a heavy ice tea with full flavor ~ I only drink ice tea (no coffee or soda) so this really hit the spot 10/10.  Service - helpful and attentive.  Total price $17 plus tip.  So good I went back on Saturday Feb 5 - wife and I ordered the steam short ribs - three tasty, tasty \"asian sliders\" as the waitress called them - 10/10.  Sampled both the sweet potato and Truffle Parmesan Fries ~ Sweet potato ok 7/10, T Parmesan 8/10 too much truffle drowns out the rest of the flavors.  (Hey how about a fries sampler - great margins in fries) Shared a Ronin Burger, nice flavor, great presentation, 6.5/10, but undercooked for my liking ~ consulted with waitress, she explained that medium is the way their are cooked, hmm, hmm ~ a medium cooked burger has quite a degree of variance, from a sliver of pink to gushy pink as this was.... Bachi, I would recommend noting on your menu that the burgers are cooked \"medium\" and describe it as such and empower/train your staff to recognize and solve customer problems.  Saturday 2/3, the staff was ill equipped and had problems meeting the needs of a 3/4 full restaurant.  While we ate, it took Bachi over 15 mins to seat four parties (one group actually left) with many tables empty - gotta work that bug out cause I want you guys around the next time I am in Las Vegas.  I dropped off a menu a the hotel concierge (joe/doug at the mandarin oriental) and told them this is a great place.   Summary: Superior Food (noting the burger cooking issue), Service - needs improvement!  The food is too good to compromise with spotty sub par service.",

Had the truffle fries with special sauce, served maybe a teaspoon of sauce and when we asked for more we were told it was an extra charge of fifty cents. Never before been charged for extra sauce so I dont think we would be returning. They give you one teaspoon of sauce with the fries so you can \"purchase\" extra, which came full. go figure. Also ordered the sweet potatoe fries which were excellent but the citrus sauce literally tasted like bleech. When they asked how we liked everything I told them the sauce tasted funny and I couldn't eat it they said it must have been the strong asian citrus in the sauce however,, they still charged for the extra sauce which we needed to compensate for the disgusting sweet potatoe frie aiola sauce. won't be returning as I didnt feel it was a good value and to be honest the extra ketchup charge really irritated me. sorry thumbs down on this place and the extra charge for french fry sauce.",

    "text": "This place was the location of a friend of mine's birthday party.  He initially reserved 10 seats but there ended up being 15 of us.  Now, any normal restaurant would accommodate the additional people, but not this place.  They were more concerned about the other reservations, than the people standing around the tables, waiting for chairs, let alone another table to slide up to the group.  Then, on top of that, the waitress that was taking the order fully admitted to us that she was underage, but was still serving alcoholic beverages to our party, which last time I checked, I believe that's illegal.  The ordering was rushed, every question was replied by the waitress as \"i dont know, I've heard its good\", which in plain english means I have no idea what it tastes like.  The food was ordered, it took a good solid 30-45 min to get it, however, their additional servers were among the slowest I've ever seen.  I ordered some of the garlic and pepper fries since none of their burgers come with fries ( a severe crime if you ask me), but I wanted to give the food a fair chance regardless of crappy service.  The burger was the Ronin burger, which after reviewing the menu, had ALOT of ingredients, over 7 to be exact, including custom condiments which after tasting, i could do without.  The burger itself fell apart when i took my first bite, leading me to believe their cooks don't fully understand how to properly prepare the angus beef they claim to be using and just shovel it onto the bun, hoping no one will notice or care.  It was well done at least, not juicy at all, which i assume is why there was so many toppings to the burger to compensate for the lack thereof.  Our order of garlic and pepper fries came out about 20 min after we got our burgers, and to my suprise, it was jalapeno pepper fries, not black pepper like normal people use.  I can't handle spicy foods all that well, I tried 2 fries, and I was done, heartburn kicked in and I was miserable and upset that I paid $4 for fries that on the menu, said NOTHING about the pepper being Jalapeno peppers.  This lack of detail will seriously hurt this restaurant, along with the severely poor service and treatment of guests.  Then, after we ate, the server came back out and asked us all what we ordered because she screwed up the bills.  We paid in cash for our bill, and the server never came back with our change, again, I believe that's illegal as well.  So its a good thing we didn't pay with large bills, otherwise she might have thought she was being tipped massively for being a complete idiot.  I complained that I didn't even receive our receipt for the meal, and she looked at us like we're the idiots.  This place has a interesting concept, however, the size of the seating area, combined with inept service and shitty management, will be its downfall.  I'll be amazed if it lasts a year or two at the most.",

It ended up being closer to 30 minutes. The hostess was really unfriendly, but the waitress we had was great.  We tried the oxtail fries which I liked. Everything on the menu is very unique.  The burgers I saw coming out while waiting all looked really \"pretty\" and the meat patties looked tasty. I ordered the $25 shogun burger, with eel and foie gras on it. It wasn't incredible, but it was definitely interesting and new to me and I enjoyed it. My friends ordered the ronin burger and the lonely bird burger and they both loved it.   I like how the menu has such unusual burgers and I'd like to try more.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Came back again and tried chili fried chicken. It's made with a mix of chili, ginger, garlic and soy sauce, and tastes exactly like what you'd get if you mixed all those together. I think it was ok, the dipping sauce had a unique flavor.  Also had the sweet potato fries, which I think came with the same or similar sauce as the chili chicken did. The fries were cooked well, but tasted pretty much the same as sweet potato fries anywhere else.  Had the ronin burger this time, which had a very similar dark sauce flavor that the shogun burger had. I think i'd prefer the ronin over the shogun just because the shogun is a mix of such unusual flavors, and the ronin is closer to a regular burger.",

My first go around here I tried the garlic & chili edamame,  which I now get every visit, and for awhile I kept getting the lonely bird, which is a really good alternative to red meat if you are trying to stay a little health conscious. So I strayed from the bird and got the Kiki burger, wow it's so tasty, the different flavors in combination together give this burger 5 stars. I love french fries so I have to try all the different options, I have to say the sweet potato fries are my favorite and I like to dip them in the pineapple ketchup. I love boba tea so I usually get the milk tea or the taro boba for dessert.   Only downer about this place is we usually have to wait for a table, they should add some more tables, service has always been good.",

You can kind of tell that the fries don't have the same flavor profile as regular chili cheese fries, but I wouldn't say that oxtail jumped out at me. Granted, these fries were pretty freaking good and I'd get them again...but the oxtail flavor doesn't sing.   The Shogun burger ($26...pricey I know) comes with seared foie gras, asain pear, arugula, unagi (eel) and the angus beef patty. This burger was probably one of the BEST burgers I've ever had! The foie really put it over the edge for me. The foie was in-your-face delicious and the pear had enough acid to cut through the foie. I didn't really care for the unagi. I hardly tasted it at all so that was the only \"ehh\" part about it. But definitely one of the best burgers and if you're in a baller mood you should order it!",

    "text": "Bachi Burger is amazing. This is where I ate the BEST burger of my life. I wish it was a franchise cause I would totally invest every penny into it to bring it to NY. The Myagi-san burger changed my life, I will never look at a burger the same way again. This is not the burger that all other burgers will be judged against.  I went to Bachi Burger twice during my stay in Vegas. The first time the food was EXCELLENT. We ordered: Myagi-san burger, truffle parm fries and the kiki burger with a red velvet milkshake to go. Everything was amazing. 5  star food and experience.  The second time we went we got the Ronin burger, pork belly buns, oxtail fries and portuguese donuts. Everything was decent this time around but not outstanding like our first time there. Ronin burger was good but I felt it lacked a bit in flavor. The pork belly buns were different, but I thought they were only yummy when smothered in the sauce they came with. The Oxtail fries reminded me of just regular chilli cheese fries....the oxtail part did not really shine through flavor wise (Yelpers hyped this up so much I was kind of disappointed when I tasted it....go in with an uninfluenced mind and maybe you will enjoy them more than I did). I thought that the Portuguese donuts were a bit too dense and I would have preferred to have them served on a plate instead of in a paper cone.....sugar was everywhere. But these are very minor details. Over all the second time around I would still rate the food and experience 4 stars.",

    "text": "I guess I'm truly in the minority on this place.  So many of my Yelp friends gave it rave reviews that I was really excited to try this place when my friend was in town in March.  (It was also one of the only places that you could get boba at 10pm.)  So we go inside and there's a strange mix of smells.  At first you're like, \"Oh, this is different\" and I try to associate different with good, but the smells change and you're like, \"Hmm, not sure if good\" with a confused look on your face.  I think the servers are trained to ignore that look, because I caught a couple of people who walked through the door doing the same thing.  It was pretty busy when we went but I could see at least a handful of tables clean.  We still waited about 10 minutes to be seated.  We almost walked out but boba was the main goal so we stuck it out and sat down.  Waiter was OK.  Definitely not exceptional.  He wasn't thrilled when we first ordered waters and boba.  The boba was slow to come out and wasn't really boba... definitely wasn't 5-star worthy in any way shape or form.  I decided to suck it up and order an appetizer - their oxtail chili cheese fries.  Sure, why not.  They were decent, but certainly nothing to go crazy over.  And the sunny-side up egg on it was just...no.  Didn't really fit anything.  That's kind of how I felt about the whole menu, though - trying to be hipster and cool with all their \"weird pairings\" that didn't make sense unless you were also hipster and cool.  I dunno.  I'll eat damn near anything, but 95% of the menu sounded weird, ridiculous, or both.  And because of that, they feel like they can charge exorbitant prices.  $12 for chili cheese fries?  Ox is NOT that expensive of a meat, so sorry, I don't buy that.  We paid our tab for half-eaten fries and sub-par boba.  Won't be going back.",

    "text": "Tried the following:   Ronin burger -- Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ, and Yuzu citrus aioli.  Not bad but not spectacular either.  We ordered the meat medium done but it came closer to medium well done.  Personally I think there's too much going on with this burger.  Too many condiments for my liking.  When mixed together, the flavors become confusing and messy.    Miyagi san burger -- Chili mayo, fried egg, Furikake caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings.  Delicious!  The meat was juicy and tender.  The burger was huge because of the layer of crispy onion rings.  Couldn't fit it in my mouth so ate some of the onion rings first.  I'm a fan of onion rings so this was my type of burger.    Oxtail chili cheese fries -- good but nothing special about it.  To me taste pretty much the same as any chili cheese fries, but just with some minced oxtail meat. You could taste a hint of oxtail but for the most part the chili flavor overshadow the oxtail flavor.    Overall, good burgers.  I I would come again to try other items on their menu.  Next time I'll try the steam bao sandwiches.",

Especially enjoyable after two huge misses at Caesars Palace (Gordon Ramsey Pub and Serendipity 3).  We stopped here for lunch before heading back to Los Angeles on Saturday.  Service was fantastic (from a super cute waitress).  The only drawback was that the unagi was a bit \"chewy\".  So, I am wondering if that was undercooked.  But, I was so greatful so such yumminess, that I am upgrading my rating to 5 stars.  Food:  4.5 stars Service:  5.0 stars",

I wanted something new and different and so my friends recommended this place and by the Gods of Olympus was this place absolutely amazing.  The place was about 10 minutes from the strip, but for those going back to Cali through the 15, this is the perfect pit stop before going home. The place had a wait, but we got seated rather quickly. The inside was very modern with a nice bar and good selection of beers.  Anyways I split the Ox Tail Fries with my friend and ho' man was this goooooood! It was shoe string fries covered in chili cheese, tender ox tail, and one yolky egg. To absolutely die for. It is definitely big enough to feed three people so we were full after devouring it.   At the same time I got a Ronin Burger medium rare. The bun was crispy and the meat was juicy. It also had an egg and some sweet sides that I wish I remembered right now.  Customer service was great. They refilled our drinks all the time, took our trash, and was around enough to make sure everything was fine. Definitely deserves 5 stars.",

The furikake and fried egg should be more than enough to throw someone over the edge.  Delicious.  The other favorites are a tie between the Shogun and Mr. Ho's burgers.  One is uber fancy w/ the foie gras and the other has a weird Hoisin Mayo and Taro Bun combo... interestingly tasty.  As much as I LOVE this place... they do need to work on the dessert options.  The fruit tart was amazing when they had it (got discontinued).  Despite being almost always too full to order anything after my burger and truffle parm fries... sometimes I want something sweet.  Unfortunately, there aren't any decent options.  Please look into a Bachi Brick Toast (you know what I'm saying?!).  It's what you're missing!",

So we were glad to see they made it on tv:)) We purposely went so that we could order the Vietnamese style steam buns with duck and pork folded inside like a little taco. But once we got there and started seeing everyone else's burgers coming to their tables, we were like, forget it, we're ordering hamburgers!! They're beautiful and delicious! The buns are different than most. I don't have any photos to share but just look at the gallery!! We had fried eggs on ours:)) Umm...Cloud 9! And we also ordered the truffle fries. Wow. What a great thing?! We were instant fans. Nice modern place. Not a fast food joint as there is a wait staff. I think they opened a second location? We haven't been back in a while, but will definitely make it a purpose again!!",

I used to crave this constantly.   The banh mi burger is another solid burger choice with fresh vegetables and a delicious sauce to dip the burger in. It also has a very unique curry aoili that's a great addition.   Not a fan of any burger with a taro bun but that's just my own taste.   All the fries are great but the garlic fries are my favorite. Wasn't crazy about the oxtail fries, a little heavy and monotonous for my taste  but my brother enjoys them. The pork buns are okay but i wouldn't order them again.

Gluttony choices: - Oxtail chili cheese fries with egg (Speechless....is effn delicious too vulgar?) - Miyagi Waygu Beef Burger: juicy burger, lots of flavor, the cheese and fried onion strips sealed the deal!  - Pork Belly with Sweet Buns: subtle and simple  There was a slight wait, but I understand since it was small location. Service: was good, just seemed like it was the \"Sunday no one wanted to be there type of vibe\"  If you are in Vegas and tired of the food on the strip and willing to venture off....this is a must try! Highly recommended and definitely will be back!",

I came back for another Bachi-style lunch on my most recent trip to Vegas, and every expectation was exceeded -- all thanks to a friend named Miyagi-San.  Who exactly is Miyagi-San, you ask?  Only the BEST DAMN BURGER IN THE UNIVERSE.  A perfectly cooked, grass-fed Wagyu beef patty.  Fried egg.  Caramelized bacon.  Onion rings.  Chili mayo.  These glorious ingredients are what you can find on the Miyagi-San burger.  They come arranged in a vertical tower of architectural splendor.  The Miyagi-San burger pairs perfectly with a plate of Bachi pickles.  The umami of the burger plays in perfect harmony with the sour tang of the vegetables.  Every bite is heaven.  Meals like this are the stuff gastronomic dreams are made of.  If burger-induced ecstasy happens to be on your bucket list, a visit to Bachi is a must.",

The burger was perfectly cooked (medium rare) with bacon, furikake seasoning and onion rings.   The fries were the possibly the best 'dressed up' fries I've ever had. Topped with onion salt, cilantro, fresh jalapenos, lemon grass (?) with a delicious dipping sauce.   I'll be back for sure.",

Tried the Ronin and it was just so damn bomb. Patty was meaty, juicy and perfectly cooked. The soy glaze worked well to bring a tangy, salty-sweet flavor to enhance the meaty-ness. The egg just brought everything together.  Oxtail chili fries are just that. \"Oxtail chili\" - a chili made from oxtail. I was somehow expecting big chunks of oxtail in my chili but I guess they grind the meat. My misunderstanding I guess. Still bomb though.  A definite must try and/or return destination while in Vegas.",

Most people live and die by these (and the truffle fries I didn't try), but I thought the oxtail was too much chili like and not tender shreds of tail like. The fried egg on top of fries is definitely amazing.  The burgers are hit and miss: Ronin burger - reminded me of eating sushi rolls in a burger. Tons of great miso glaze, a fried egg, carmelized onion, multiple BBQ and other glazes. Delish. Worth $11.  Kiki burger - great use of 3 types of asian mushrooms, grueye cheese and sauce. Worth $11.  Miyagi-san grass fed Wagyu burger - very average. Didn't taste amazing. Tasted like a regular burger. Not worth $14.  Shogun burger - wagyu beef with foie gras. Didn't taste anything special at all. Definitely not worth $26, even with asian pear, miso butter and asian peaches inside. Skip it.  3.5 stars overall. The taste is very good, but it's not as amazing and not worth an hour-2 hour wait in my opinion. Definitely give it a try though.",

    "text": "Bachi Burger is easily THE BEST custom burger restaurant I have ever been to, and I miss it dearly now that I live in the Bay Area. I've had dreams about this place, and the withdrawal levels are running high, at this point.  My wife and I used to live pretty close to the Windmill location, and we frequented this location about a dozen times. We've tried a number of the burgers there, as well as the oxtail chili cheese fries ($11.50) as an appetizer. These oxtail chili cheese fries are amazing. They have garlic aioli and a fried egg on top of fries with oxtail pieces on top of it... incredibly tasty, even if you aren't traditionally an oxtail fan.  With regards to burgers, my personal favorite has always been the Kiki's Burger ($10.00). I recommend this burger if you are a big mushroom fan. This burger is packed with sauteed shiitake, enoki and eryngii mushrooms in it with caramelized bacon, a sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, with a garlic aioli spread. One of the unheralded parts of their burgers is the amazing bun that they use for the burger. It is toasted just perfectly, and it complements everything in between the buns. The patty is always cooked and seasoned so well. Extremely juicy, and it blends perfectly with the mushrooms, cheese, garlic aioli and the rest of the amazing ingredients. The Kiki's burger is to die for.  A lot of other people also love the Ronin Burger ($10.00) because it has a fried egg in it, along with caramelized onions, some sort of Japanes cole slaw, and a Yuzu citrus aioli. This is the one that my wife and my cousin always order and they absolutely love it. This one gets a little messy though because of the egg, but it's all a part of the experience.   For side dishes, I always recommend either the Truffle Parmesan Fries ($4.00) or the Sweet Potato Fries ($4.50). Both are served with an aioli dipping sauce. It is a generous portion of fries served in a large cone shaped serving container, and 1 order is more than enough to share among 2-3 people, unless you are a beast when it comes to fries, and can finish the entire order by yourself!  I don't really have any complaints about Bachi Burger, other than the fact that the wait can be a little long, but when it's worth the wait, it doesn't matter how long the wait is! I've waited an hour before, and it made us savor the meal that much more! The only other thing that I wouldn't recommend are the boba drinks that they serve. Just wait to get a real boba drink from Chinatown after you have finished your burger. I wasn't too thrilled about the taro boba I tried once, so I never ordered it again. Other than that, everything else is flawless.   We can't wait to get back to Vegas so that we can visit one of the two Bachi Burger locations. I don't rate very many places 5-star at all (check out my reviews), so when I give something a 5-star rating, I am not joking around. Haven't found a burger place here in the Bay Area that comes remotely close to the quality and taste that I miss from Bachi Burger!!",

Fries were a good serving to share, and lemonade was pretty sweet, really sweet for my tastebuds. Watered down it was perfect!

Kiki's Burger is  pure perfection, and it was cooked to a pefect MEDIUM for a change. I was so happy with it! Juicy and very beefy. Gor the truffle parmesian fries, and OMG, they were so wonderful!

There was maybe 12-14 people already there in the small waiting area so we waited outside in the cold.  We told the young man seating people we would be outside the door. After about 45 minutes we noticed everyone ahead of us was seated and the young man was seating people that came in well after we put our name in.  We approached the podium and questioned why new couples that recently arrived are being seated ahead of us?  The \"cluck\" replied \"Uhh...someone crossed your name off\" ???   Well he was the only one we ever saw seating people and taking names.   Instead of immediately seating us he said he would put us back on the list.  Amazing !!!   Can't this restaurant find someone that can handle taking names and seating people properly and efficiently???   We left.....and \"NO, we will never return.\"",

    "text": "It was past midnight as my homegirl and I were driving back to my place as conversation about grabbing dessert arose. After some driving, she suggested a place she actually used to work at that had boba and other snacks and before I knew it, we were pulling into Bachi Burger's parking lot.  My first impression of this place was obviously the interior. The place looked modern and so comfy. What made my experience here so dope was not only the food but the friendliness of each of the staff members. The manager made our visit very pleasant, as he joked around with my friend and I. The service was definitely top-notch and a lot better than even high end restaurants I've dined at in the past. It was easy to see that the servers were genuinely nice and enjoyed engaging in conversations with you. I even noticed how personable our server was as he made an effort to stop at every table every so often. I feel bad for forgetting his name so hopefully he sees this and pats himself on the back 'coz he is awesome.  Now.. onto the food. It took me a while to decide what I wanted since I wasn't hungry enough for a burger but had the appetite for something larger than just a dessert, which was what I wanted originally, haha. After scanning Yelp for a few suggestions, I went with the truffle parmesean fries and the mandarin orange tangerine soda (which I learned they make themselves). As cliche as this sounds.. it was definitely LOVE AT FIRST BITE. The truffle oil on the fries was the perfect touch with fries that weren't too crispy or too soft. The sun-dried tomato sauce paired with the fries was the cherry atop the sundae. The mandarin orange tangerine soda was simply amazing for something that sounds so simple. My friend told me this place is owned by two brothers, one being a former executive chef for Roy's Hawaiian Fusion. No wonder this place is so damn good!  As we sat and enjoyed our better than dessert midnight snack, I watched as the table next to us received their burger orders. The burgers looked mouthwatering. I was this close to ordering one but I'll save that for my next trip.This place is perfect for late night cravings, as they are open until 2AM. We left at around 130 and there was even still another table present but the dope staff didn't even rush them to leave. I definitely will be returning soon and by then, I'm sure Bachi Burger will be a household name. This is a restaurant that deserves to be part of the hype 'coz it sure as hell lives up to it.",

    "text": "In the early days of Bachi Burger....I honestly went here one too many times and got sick of the place, but I am so glad I went back this past weekend!  The menu is definitely expanded and refined compared to their early days.  Eatworthy items included the oxtail chili cheese fries.....think chili cheese fries dolled up with oxtail chunks, jalapenos, and then a sunny side egg on top.  It was a thing of beauty when it arrived at the table....I was almost reluctant to break the egg and mix it into the chili.  For those afraid of eating eggs slightly raw.....once the egg is broken, the hot chili cheese cooks the egg yolk into the chili cheese sauce...so don't worry ;)   We shared it amongst four and it was definitely just enough without over indulging.  Onto the burgers, they have many new burgers compared to when I frequented this place last.  The Miyagi-san grass fed beef burger I think was made with me in mind, since it included all my favorite ingredients: chili mayo, furikake, bacon, crispy onion rings, AND my favorite fried egg!  Other burgers, I've enjoyed in the past...but not as much as the Miyagi-san is the Kiki burger and for a little less beef action....the fish burger is quite tasty as well.  If we hadn't chose the oxtail fries...the truffle fries are a delicious alternative as well.  The service is just as slow as it was before....but I give the wait time to the fact that the burgers come out and look and taste of quality preparations.  And I still love the bun concept they have...instead of regular old buns...they have what is similar to the Chinese baked barbecue pork buns with a little sweet glaze...yum so soft and fluffy.",

My girl busted out laughing as we past this place after eating at the Japanese restaurant next door, figure we'd give it a try next time.  We ordered the ronin burger, the steamed buns with pork belly, sweet potato fries, truffle parmesan fries, matcha green tea, and the toffee cake for dessert.    The ronin burger was delicious with the egg yolk over the med-rare kalbi, but the steamed buns were a bit pricey for two small pieces even though it was good.  Both fries were pretty good eats.  I'll stick with my matcha green tea smoothie from Jamba next time, the tea was too grassy for my taste.  And unfortunately the toffee cake tasted like something pre-packaged, just ok.  We'll definitely come back to try some of the other burgers.",

Fries were crispy & done perfectly. I attempted to order the Bahn Mi burger medium rare which in most restaurants means medium. I has hesitant when the waitress said that the chef recommended it medium. I thought great I am going to get a dried out cardboard burger. But when it arrived it was so juicy, flavorful & was deep pink in the middle. We all cut our burgers into quarters so each of us could have a try of each one & I was so sad to have to let others try mine because it was soooo good. The other burgers were great as well but I loved the Bahn Mi Burger the most. It was my 1st time ever having one. I definitely will be going back to this place & rave about it.",

Just walking into the place, it smelled so appetizing that I couldn't wait to start eating. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful with choosing the things off the menu because this is definitely not what you would call a typical burger joint. We started off with the Thai iced tea and then ordered the Miyagi-sans Grass Fed Wagyu burger and the Truffle Parmesan fries. The food did take a while to come out but that is because everything is prepared fresh. The burger consisted of chili mayo, fried egg, crispy onion rings and caramelized onions. It was so big that I could barely try to take a bite out of it. The wagyu was so tender, that it just melted in my mouth. There was so much flavor in the burger that each bite put a smile on my face. There is no certain way to describe the truffle parmesan fries with the dipping sauce except that it was like a party in my mouth. The fries are drizzled with black truffle porcini cream and grated parmesan. All the food is very reasonably priced and I wish I had room to try some of their dessert. I can't wait to go back and try the different burgers and desserts on the menu. I'm not even a huge burger fan but I am in love with this place!",

I thought that the prices were a little high for an \"off strip\" burger joint as the Burger Bar at Mandalay Place had equally as good burgers at similar prices. I had a grapefruit soda that was good but cost $3.50. No refills!  The appetizers were very interesting and we ordered the Garlic stir fried edamame and it was good. The french fries were good but again due to the price of the burgers I thought that the fries should have come with the burger.  The total check for the two of us with the tip was $45 with no alcohol and I think that is a bit much for a small plain neighborhood burger joint.",

They fixed the cashier,  It seems to be a little pricier or I'm just more broke lately. Fries could have been hotter but not cold by any means. Lonely Bird is where its @.

There were five of us for lunch and everything we tasted was delicious.    I had the Miso Burger and even almost three weeks later I still have dreams about it.  The Patty was cooked perfectly and the flavor combination was terrific.  I actually split this burger and the Ronin burger with someone else and was sorry I did.  Not that the Ronin was great, just the Miso was that much better.   The table had 2 Ronin burger, a regular burger (my husband likes everything plain and simple), Peking Duck Steamed Buns, and a Kiki Burger(they brought this by mistake but the boys all shared it and they loved it.    We started with the Bachi Pickles, I liked them a lot no one else seemed to enjoy them as much.  The asian spin was a great twist.  We also had the Garlic Salt & Pepper French Fries and the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Although an afterthought in my review definitely not an afterthought here. They stand up very nicely on their own.  Particularly the truffle one, we were battling it out for the last bite.  Service here was very attentive even if mistakes were made.  The staff was very friendly and quickly corrected any issues.",

We got the parm fries and the salt and pepper fries, both were very tasty. I finished my burger within minutes, and one of the owners came out to check on us to make sure everything was good.

Their sauces really hype of the flavor and quality of their angus beef.   Appetizers:  Garlic, Truffle Edamame Holy edamame! These are jam packed with flavor. These damn soy beans just make me want to stop at the appetizers.  Sweet Potato Fries I think the fries come out perfect in terms of having flavor in EACH french fry. The sauce is great too.  Entrees:  The Ronin Burger is absolutely amazing! I love the fried egg on top as the yolk breaks during the first bite.  The Spicy Miso Burger makes me want to drool as I am writing this review. It continues to make an individual bite into its soft, delicious warm center. The sauce makes it even better because it is so unique that I can't figure out how to duplicate it.  Their Bachi Burger is also GREAT if you want to just have a plain burger and taste their wonderful angus beef patty.  Every individual in Las Vegas has to try this place!!!",

We had seen this place on DD&D and despite sometimes having mixed results when following their recommendations Bachi Burger just looked fantastic.  We shared an order of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries as an appetizer & they were fantastic - somehow the fries didn't go soggy when smothered in the chili, the addition of a fried egg and cilantro just added to the depth of flavor from the excellent meat/texas style chili.  We then ordered the Kiki and Ronin burgers to share with an order of onion rings.  The burgers were cooked very well (nice and pink in the middle), very juicy and the toppings were fresh.  The buns were good - kind of \"sticky\" like a steamed bun - but the onion rings were the stand out.  They were like tempura onion rings and I highly recommend them.  We also got a side of the pineapple ketchup with was great with the onion rings.  I would for sure head back here to try more of the burgers on the menu and also get an order of those chili cheese fries that i wouldn't share!",

We waited about 15 min for our table, there were three of us. After ordering, it did take about 50 minutes for our food. I ordered the Bachi Caesar Salad, and Sweet Potatoe Fries to share. My friend ordered this Pesto Burger and said it was excellent! I can't remember what my third guest ate, but he said he hadn't had a burger that good in a while.  The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it took 50 minutes to get our food (we noticed, because we were especially hungry that night). Also, our waiter and the water filled guy kept checking in with us to make sure everything was alright.... AFTER WE HAD RECEIVED OUR FOOD. It was pretty funny because they checked in with us about 4 times (not an exaggeration).   Burgers are good, but don't go here if you're in a rush. Oh, decent prices too!",

Immediately afterwards, the bartender asks if we'd like to sit down I told her what the hostess said and she told us to take a seat and that she'd take care of us. Awesome.   As for the food, the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries are a must have. EVERY. SINGLE. VISIT. All those flavors together coupled with the tenderness of the oxtail! Mmmhmmm! You really can't go wrong with any of the burgers. I've had the Kalbi Burger, Ronin Burger, Mr. Ho's Burger and the Banh Mi Burger.   The Banh Mi Burger was definitely interesting. I love Banh Mi whenever I eat Pho but I didn't quite know what to expect from the burger. It wasn't bad by any means but I wouldn't order it again especially over the other options.

Honestly there's not much more I can say in regards to this place this isn't summed up in that sentence but I guess I should back up a little bit first.  Being on a rare trip to the Southside of town with my mom, I pulled out my Yelp app (shameless plug) to find out what interesting place was nearby that I wanted to try.  Needless to say we were literally next to Bachi Burger so the decision was made.    When we walked in we had to wait a few minutes since there quite a few large parties there that night but once were seated the pace was a bit quicker, although it still took a while for the burgers to come out.  Luckily for us the Assistant Manager was incredibly friendly and made sure we were at least attended well all evening.    I ordered a Strawberry Boba Milk Tea while my mom had the Peanut Butter Chocolate Milke Shake.  While I liked my tea, in the end I wished I had gone with the rich milkshake instead.  We also ordered the Truffle Parmesan fries while we waited for our burgers, and their were tasty, but I don't think the combo really meshed for either of us.  Needless to say those went in the doggy bag for my brothers.    When it came to the burgers themselves, I tried half of the Spicy Miso Burger and half Kiki's Burger.  The Kiki's Burger is pretty good but I found the sweetness level a little surprising and sort offset the rest of the burger for me.  It was the Spicy Miso Burger that was the real winner to me.  The pepper, the roasted garlic, and the egg all came together in a perfect combination!  Each bite was flavorful and amazing!  Needless to say it will be a conundrum for return trips whether I'll stick with this burger or see what creations they have concocted, but needless to say, I will return.",

    "text": "Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.  Wait time: Always a wait  Ambiance: Not laid out well. You are sitting in a row of 50 other people eating 2 feet next to you. It feels like a school cafeteria. Last time we came they were going through a remodel. Maybe they added a few barstools.  Food:Fries brought out 15 min before the burger. They were soggy when they brought them out. Ordered the burgers medium/well because my girlfriend just recently had food poisoning so we didnt want to take any chances. Both of our burgers came out COMPLETElY RARE on the inside. Its was seriously cold uncooked meat in both of our burgers.   Staff: This is the absolute most horrible part about our experience. I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. We first sat at a table and after no one saying a word to us for 5 minutes, we decided to move to the bar in hopes of getting some service. Sat at the bar for another 5 minutes until a gentlemen named John who I later found out was the manager came up to us asking if we needed anything.  I answered \"yes we have not been helped yet, we're ready to order\". This guy gives me the most blank stare like he was stoned out of his mind and says \"ok one second\". He proceeds to go behind behind the bar and walks over to this kid with  mo-hawk like hair who's busy making drinks and points at us while telling him something. The mo-hawk guy shrugs his shoulders and the manager walks away. A few moments later a girl with blonde hair comes over an takes our order. Fries come out first. Soggy and not good. We look around for the waitress or manager who are both nowhere to be found to send the fries back. Here comes the most crazy thing I have ever seen in a restaurant in my life. The manager walks behind the bar, grabs a bottle of Fireball Whisky, and pours 2 shots in to shot glasses. He taps the mo-hawk guy on the shoulder, hands him a shot very sneaky like and starts walking towards my girlfriend and I. Right when I was about to open my mouth to say something about the fries he bends down right in front of us pretending to tie his shoe or something and takes the shot. He literally stands up with the most disgusted look on his face (as all people have when doing fireball). My girlfriend and I both sat there with our mouths dropped open. He knew instantly that he was busted. (stealing alcohol and drinking while \"managing\") He disappeared in the back room and the mo-hawk guy went back to making drinks. Our burgers came out a few minutes later. We both checked to make sure the burgers were plenty cooked. Cold rare meat. They were slightly seared on the outside. I figured The girl didnt hear me right and rang them up as medium/rare on accident. When she came by the bar I flagged her down showing her the burger and the uncooked meat. She asks us if we want the burgers remade. I said politely to her \"no thank you, we've actually been having a really bad experience. Nothing to do with you.\" Her only answer to that statement was \"OK\" then she walked away as if she was upset for some reason? I didnt know what that meant so I sat there for another minute when she came back to the bar and says to me \"Well I checked the order and I put it in medium/well how you asked. Sorry you didnt like it\". She then drops the check on the counter and walks away. I was very surprised that she not only brought me the check for food that we didnt take one bite of, but she didnt even bring a manager out or address our concerns. I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar. The blonde stared at me and looked at another server who said to her \"John\" implying that he was well aware of John drinking on the job. They told me that he was the only manager there but the nice male server agreed with me that I shouldnt have to talk to a drunk manager about my issues. He gave me the name of the owner \"Aaron\" and let them know I was not paying for food I didnt eat and I wanted to talk to the owner tomorrow to let him know about my experience. I could show him all the problems with his restaurant starting with his so called \"manager\" who stands around doing shots instead of trying to help the business flow better. This place needs to go on bar rescue. I hope the owner sees this and does something about it. He needs to get some real staff in there with rules and that know a thing or two about customer service.",

Make sure to get the pickles appetizer, it's really good.  And all of the edemame are fantastic! Oh, and go for the regular fries with the pineapple ketchup--so good!    I downgraded one star because I've been here 6 times over the course of the past two years and never once has my order been 100% correct.  It's never anything major, but it's always enough of an annoyance that it needs a mention.  And I think it's kinda weird that they charge an extra $1 for additional ketchup for the already pricey fries.",

    "text": "Bachi Burger. I don't know what it was about you, but when I saw your sign it instantly intrigued me.  My sister's recommendation solidified my decision to give this place a try. When I went, it was during their soft opening. The waitress told me they had just opened and hadn't had a grand opening yet. Despite this little detail, the place was packed! And up till now, every time I go to Bachi, it's always full. This unfortunately can be a problem. Seating is limited and I once waited 30 minutes to get a table for 2. They did offer to put in our order so the food would be ready by the time we were seated. This also relates to a second problem I have with Bachi: the wait time for food. It takes longer than average to get your food once you've ordered it. But if you're patient, you'll be rewarded. Don't let impatience ruin your Bachi experience.  Despite these few issues, Bachi Burger is awesomely delicious. I've had the opportunity to sample almost every item on the menu and everything is good. I appreciate the creativity and flavor combinations in the different specialty burgers. My favorite happens to be the Bachi fish burger (fish? at a burger place? i know...). With all the specialty burgers, I have had several family and friends choose the original bachi burger as their favorite, exhibiting that this burger joint knows how to make a good, simple, but very tasty burger.",

    "text": "i really wanted to like you bachi burger... but your burgers are just okay.  let's start with the service. i'm guessing that management read the negative reviews because our service was very good. we were asked if we needed a few more minutes to decide and once we ordered the server apologized for the wait. hmm... no apology needed.. we were the ones who needed more time!  the food didnt take long to come out. the crusty crab came out first with the garlic salt and pepper fries. i ordered the ronin burger which came out a few minutes later.   the fries were really good at first.. but soon became a little soggy. i read that the mango chutney on the crusty crab was not very yummy so i made sure that my friend ordered it on the side. he said if it had been in the burger it would have made it too sweet. as a courtesy... i think the server asked for my sauce to be on the side. im not sure but it was nice.   i liked the crusty crab over the ronin burger. i cut my burger in half and ended up throwing the second half away. i'll explain later. the ronin burger has a strong sour taste. it may be one of the dressings/sauces. i thought it was overpowering. i like the fried egg but thats about it. oh... well maybe the bun too. the bun reminds me of the top of the pork buns that are baked and not steamed. very soft!  so because i didnt like my burger i ordered the peking duck steamed buns because it was actually what i realllly wanted. but how could i go to a burger place and not order a burger right? should have gone with my instinct says my friend. the steamed buns were quite tasty. the hoisin sauce went well with it.  so anyway.. my friend got sick and threw up a few hours later. we suspect it may have been the crab but who knows. i only took a bite and i was fine. but we pretty much had the same thing to eat the whole day.   will i be back? only if im in the area.",

My favorites were the cheese fries with Oxtail and the pork belly steamed buns...NEXT level amazing. The Banh-Mi, Crusty Crab, and Miyagi-san were also crowd favorites.  The service was great. They handled the big party easily and we even did birthday shots and singing with our server.

However, this burger didn't lack for overall flavor in the slightest. I also tried my husband's (?) burger and son's Kiki burger. Both were great.

I mean that in a good way of course, however, the reason I am not giving this place 5 stars has nothing to do with menu items or cuisine, but rather the inconsistency of quality. It is quite obvious that they have one or two really good chefs that are phenomenal cooks, and all the others are pretty much bench players.  Now, I don't know how many chefs they have but I came to this conclusion through logical reasoning, for I couldn't imagine their star chef having such an off day that they would produce \"BBQ in the park with friends\" quality food. So, the first 2 visits were great and then one bad, one good, and the last bad. It seems that on the busy days, like on a weekend, are the best times to go which were my first to visits. The other three visits were done through the weekdays, so if you go through the week my experience has been hit or miss (but as the record stands more miss during the week). Although, if you are interested in a boba tea just shy away, especially, if you ever been to any boba place on Spring Mountain (China Town) for you will be very disappointed.",

I had the pork buns and was extremely happy I did. I had only two disappointments. First, our server seemed to be in a hurry to turn his table. I understand it may have been the \"lunch rush\", but when I tell you I have never been there, that's your cue to make a recommendation, not stand there gazing over the rest of the restaurant.  Secondly, did you guys really need to charge us for two 1oz sides of sauce. My wife's burger was ordered without any kind of dressing so she could enjoy the chili aioli. That's just lame.

    "text": "Bachi Burger been creating quite a buzz within the Yelp community and I can totally see why.  They have a creative yet solid menu at a very affordable price.    Friends and I stopped by tonight and tried their Ronin, Kalbi, and Banh Mi Burgers.  Each burgers were well executed with Kalbi Burger being our favorite which by the way was Korean approved by a Kimchi friend in our party :D  The Ronin Burger came with fried egg, coleslaw?, and a horseradish aioli that was quite addicting. The Banh Mi Burger was pretty much a burger with the pickled carrots and daikons and lettuce served with nuoc mam (fish sauce). All burgers came with an Asian sweet bun which isn't so starchy, so primarily focusing on the protein.  yARrrrr ;D  Thanks to Tomoko M.'s recommendation we got an order of the Truffle Parmesan Fries and couldn't be more delighted.  The sun dried tomato aioli that came with it had a nice touch, but our server, Kelsey, brought out a pineapple ketchup for us which completely sealed the deal.  I seriously can't stand pineapple, but man did i want to take that baby home.   We got the Donuts and Pop Tart for dessert.  I felt the Portuguese donuts got robbed from the spotlight since the Mocha Ice Cream it came with was quite strong on the palate. I can't really give a proper opinion of the Pop Tart since my North Korean Commie friend took the entire White Chocolate Yuzu Gelato in one bite leaving me with just the heavy port wine cherry flavor and the Pop Tart.  aRrrr ;(  The whole meal was a bit heavy, but well worth it.  Going to come back with reinforcement to try the other stuff.  Verdict: If you love Slidin' Thru, you'll defiantly love Bachi Burgers. Open til 2am!",

    "text": "Listen up folks, yelp exists for a reason.  See all those 3.5 star reviews for all the overpriced restaurants on the strip.  You know the ones that don't live up to and are more expensive than the original locations in New York and Los Angeles.  The ones that don't really care about how good the food is, because the celebrity chef whose name is on the marquee is at least an entire desert and mountain range away.  Those famous name places in the hotels, they care as much about return customers as those slot machines do.  They both know that as soon as they take your money, the next stooge is going to sit down in that same seat.  Bachi Burger belongs on the strip.  It so good and different that it should be featured in the Bellagio or the Wynn, but you aren't going to find it there.  You are going to find it tucked away in a hard to see corner of a strip mall south of the airport.  This gem who MUST expand to other locations, is a concept from Chef Lorin Watada, who has worked for Roy's for many years.  The fusion of Asian flavors and burgers are so perfect together, I have no idea why nobody else has really come up with an entire menu of it before.  Sure you sometimes see a Teriyaki burger on a menu, but this is a completely different level.  We started off with Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns.  While not listed as an appetizer, they are like 3 mini sliders, so good for sharing.  The buns were nice and sticky and folded taco style around a slice of sweet duck breast, cilantro, slice of egg, thin slice of radish, scallions, black Chinese vinaigrette, and hosin BBQ sauce.  While they were a good starting point, never order them in place of a Burger! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#3zjM4SbAXTNr8cRrcyHDeg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>  I split two burgers with my brother.  Both were so good, we couldn't decide which one we liked better.  First was the Ronin Burger.  7oz of Angus beef topped with caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, miso goma dressing, and katsu BBQ sauce.  On the side was yuzu citrus aioli.  I also had them add Gruyere cheese.  The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare.  It was nice and pink.  The juices of the burger and the katsu BBQ sauce went so perfectly together I couldn't distinguish them as separate entities anymore.  The Japanese cabbage slaw had a nice crunchy sweet vinegar flavor to offset the texture of the burger.  I'm usually not a huge fan of a fried egg on my burger, but this just seemed so right.  So many times, burger joints throw on a fried egg for \"shock value\".  Somehow on this burger it was tastefully done to enhance the burger.  The miso goma sauce was on the slaw side of the bun.  The sweet rice wine/ sesame flavor worked perfectly with the slaw.  At this point my taste buds were just singing.  How could you need more flavor?  What was this yuzu citrus aioli about?   I added some of it just on one bite, and  found that the burger really didn't need it at all.  In fact that was the opinion I had about every side of sauce served with each item.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#8s5ab8tv_OI9keGxjmPErw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>  The second burger may have been even better!  More unique in flavor for sure.  The Banh-Mi Burger.  Ok, brace yourselves.  The patty is made up of...ground angus beef, pork, shrimp, pork pate, lemongrass, and plenty of other herbs and spices.   It was topped with pickled carrots & radish, cilantro, curry aioli, and lettuce.  The nuoc mam dipping sauce (fish sauce with lime, garlic, vinegar, etc..) was served in a large bowl on the side.  Plenty of room to dip your burger in the bowl.  But once I did that, I felt the strong sauce covered up the wonderful flavor of the burger.  Again we had it medium rare and the juices were everywhere.  For those that complain that the burgers are too juicy and the bun can get soggy....Eat it faster!!!  I actually thought the bun held up well.  A burger that tastes this good, isn't going to last long on my plate.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#ETcasvkOZaGaNUM3ZVIoQA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>  A burger isn't complete without some fries.  We had the Truffle Parmesan Fries, which were enough to share.  This isn't your usual truffle oil just poured on the fries, it's black truffle porcini cream.  WOW it was great, but not very much of it.  I wonder if you can get extra of it on your fries if you are willing to pay more.  The fries were perfectly cooked and sliced thin.  Topped with a small amount of slightly melted parmesan cheese.  Really after you got past the the top layer of fries, there wasn't much topping left, so share nicely everyone!   We stayed away from the Sun Dried Tomato Aioli dipping sauce as the flavor overpowered a much superior flavor of the fries.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#z7-52AroniBC5F63yI0D4A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>  Nothing left to say other than GO NOW!",

    "text": "We came here tired of the usual eat-till-you-hate-yourself buffet that typically characterize Vegas trips but still looking for quality food. And we found Bachi Burger, the epitome of Asian-American fusion. What a gem to find in the middle of Vegas!  Faves: - Organic Edamame. I got the garlic truffle ones, which got a little too garlicky after a while, so I'd probably get the normal salted ones next time. - I ordered the Truffle Parmesan, but I ended up liking my roommate's Sweet Potato Fries more! The serving size is perfect for one person; so if you like your fries as much as I do, do NOT share/split haha.  - Sure, the Ronin Burger is super popular, but I also recommend the Banh-Mi. How creative. - Vegetarians! Many options for you. Plus, this is probably one of the only places on land that sells a real-life KRUSTY CRAB BURGER! haha. Plankton, eat yo heart out.  BE SURE to specify if you don't want kimchi on your burgers! It's an acquired taste, and the waiters definitely understand, haha.   Drinks were surprisingly tasty here! The boba here was probably better than a lot of places back in LA. Get one.  Only thing that keeps it 4-star: service was mediocre. It took a long time to get seated (despite there being many empty tables), food took a long time, and it was hard to get the attention of the servers at times.",

    "text": "So, this use to be one of my favorite burger spots, but I am so disappointed in my experience tonight! First of all the energy level of the servers is very low. MANAGEMENT take care of your people and they'll take care of your patrons. Everyone looked overworked and under cared for. Speaking of not being taken care of, the restaurant looks ran down. All the tables are chipped and kept stable by placing napkins under the feet. There's a huge hole at the bottom of the booth seats. But what really got me is the cooks in the kitchen playing music that was louder than the intercom music. Not only was the music loud but it was inappropriate rap music with cursing and a lot of use of the \"N\" word. There were children in the business and I know if I was offended, I'm pretty sure their parents were too. I'm a person who enjoys rap music as much as the next person but I was utterly appalled by what I was hearing while dining at your establishment. To top it off my burger lacked flavor. You all need some serious customer service training! :(",

We started off with the Ox tail chili cheese fries. Words can not begin to describe the deliciousness of this dish. I almost ended up eating the whole thing myself. This dish is a must have when going to Bachi Burger. I ordered the Myagi and the wife ordered the Spicy Miso with grilled onions. I ordered my burger med rare and the wife ordered her's med, but I ended up with a med burger and she ended up with med rare. I am not one to return food, so I ate it, and it was phenomenal! Didn't get to try my wife's burger but she raved about it, but only had one knock, and that was it wasn't spicy enough...But still awesome!! Next time I'm in Vegas we will definitely stop by again!",

Bachi burger doesn't have the best vegetarian burger but overall their selection of creative burgers are amazing. If you don't eat meat like myself, i would try the fish burger and the crab cake burger.  The fish burger is mouth watering with naturally buttery cod and the crab cake is full of flavor and leaves you full. All the fries are amazing with the not so normal ponzu cream sauce that gives a kick in ur mouth. I love the sweet potato fries. The only downside of this place is their dessert menu... not a big fan, i think it needs major improvement. nothing cool to mention here.

Service was ok... not as bad as some other reviewers experienced. It's obvious that the restaurant is new and the wait staff is new but they are working out the kinks. It's a mixed bag of people working there... some were spot on and attentive while others were too shy and one guy was cheesy, borderline annoying. They also need to quicken the pace with getting the food out sooner. We were probably 1 of 4 tables and it seemed like forever before the food came.   So this is what we ordered: Short rib buns Ronin burger Kalbi burger Garlic salt and pepper fries  All very flavorful and tasty! However, I have to say the short rib buns were my fav. And I could have munched on the fries forever. Really good! The burgers are a good size and easy to eat. Burger places these days seem to pile on so much stuff that it's so outrageously big that you can't even bite into them. Not the case at Bachi Burger.   All in all, we would visit Bachi Burger again. It's nice to have options such as Bachi Burger away from the strip.",

    "text": "I have such a wonderful friend that lives in Las Vegas, knowing that I was traveling alone (not uncommon for me), she brought me some food from Bachi Burger.  Although I don't mind eating alone in a restaurant, it's always more fun eating with a friend.  I had the Kalbi Burger, which consists of: Ground Beef, Pork, Soy, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, Ciabatta Bun, Kim Chee and Ko Chu Jang Mayo.  Got all that?  If you're from Hawaii, you probably didn't even bat an eye when I mentioned all those things because you knew exactly what I'm talking about.  But if you're not used to Korean food, you're probably scribbling frantically to go and Google the words you don't know, right?  OK, so go Google and come back.  I'll wait for you here.  *pause*  Now that you know what all the ingredients are, here's my review.  Oh wait, let me give you my disclaimer first.  I'm not a huge burger fan.  Your occasional Mickey Dee's or grilled poolside burgers are great.  But I'm not a burger seeker outer.  With that said, this burger was magically delicious!  Not in the Lucky Charms kind of way but in the it's-so-non-typical-it's-almost-like-eating-a-plate-lunch-with-bread-instead-of-rice kind of way.  (Plate lunch:  A mixture of different food items, laid out on one plate and usually includes rice, macaroni salad - did you know that Hawaii has the highest per capita of people that have diabetes?  Now you know why.  We eat starch with our starch and then put more starch on top)  Where was I?  Oh yeah, it's like a mini plate lunch but in sandwich format.  The beef was delicious, the sauce was good and the sweet potato fries gave it a nice compliment.  All I needed to go with it was a Korean bar lady saying, \"Buy me drinky?\" and I would've had the full experience.    If you're open to trying new types of burgers, this is the place to get one from.  ^_^",

    "text": "Just walked in, 40 minute wait. Not bad for a Saturday night. Waited about 25 minutes & 2 parties who walked in after me got seated. Went to host to see how many parties before me...my name was crossed off. No biggy, I'm with a large party, didn't make a big stink but just let them know that I've been waiting here & they never called my name. Host apologized & said it'll be no more than 10 minutes. Manager got us seated in 10 minutes & brought us an oxtail chili fries on the house. He put the fire out quick. Our server, jordan, was awesome. Had recommendations for us & attentive. I ordered the miyagi-san grass fed wagyu burger..delicious! Loved the egg, bacon, & onion rings in it. Just the right amount of everything in every bite. I ordered the pork belly steamed buns for the kids & my daughter loved it. We also had dessert...chocolate peanut butter souffle w/wild berry compote. It was ok, I was expecting more peanut butter flavor but it was made beautifully.  Check comes & they told us they took off all the gratuity for large parties. Great food and they handled everything quickly. This is how a restaurant should run. Great job, will be back when we're back in town.   Thank you bachi burger!",

The combination of sweet, juicy and crunchy makes makes bachi live up to the hype. I HIGHLY suggest making the drive from the strip just to try.",

For starters we tried the chili fried chicken and the garlic salt & pepper french fries....the chicken was not good at all...too much of their red sauce...it was both spicy and sweet.  We didn't care for it.  Fries were good on the other hand.  We ordered the Ronin Burger, The Crusty Crab, and Kalbi Burger.  The server didn't ask how we wanted our burgers cooked so we made sure that we told him.  Sheesh....After like forever we finally got our orders.  Everyone enjoyed their burger.  The bread was very good.  I loved it.  If not for their super slow service and annoying server it would have been a four star.  ;op",

The flavor that this burger had was insane! And the perfect squishy fresh roll that housed it was awesome! We also got the Bah mi burger. The flavors in this burger were so intense! It was full of flavor and both were cooked a perfect medium. We also got the fries with pineapple ketchup which were hot and crisp! Also got the belly buns which were fresh and delicious!  The chicken strips were to die for for as well! When I'm in the area again ill def be coming back here!",

Tonight we ordered the Ronin burger (..we enjoyed this from our last visit), spicy miso burger (..took a risk with this order and paid off!), and shared salt & pepper fries.  Not that we didn't like the ronin burger this time around, but we were extremely surprised & very much enjoyed the spicy miso burger much more!  We were expecting a wait tonight, as this was the case last time around, but we got seated right away. (Maybe cuz it's nascar weekend..?) Servers were friendly & attentive - always refilled our drinks before asking.   We are looking forward to our next visit and ordering the spicy miso again & trying a new burger next time around :)",

    "text": "Went to Bachi Burger the other night in a group of 4. I have frequented this restaurant before and would give it 3 to 4 stars on those visit. This visit was different for the following reasons:  1. We were put on a waiting list with our phone number so the hostess could call us. We returned to check on our spot and the hostess said she had just called our party. The hostess before did not communicate that they were using phone numbers. (must have been a shift change). Not a big deal by itself. We had good timing and did not lose our spot.  2. Server did not introduce himself and was very cold and lacked any personality or genuine concern. While the service was not terrible it was definitely lacking.   3. We were going to split 4 burgers. we requested that our burgers be cut in quarters so we could do this easily. The server told us her could bring us steak knives but they wont serve it cut. I asked another server and she said the same thing.  4. We decided to do one less burger since we were not able to have the burgers cut to share. We decided it would be too much of a project to try to do at our table with steak knives. Two of the people in our party were going to split a burger and the other two would have there own.  5. We asked if it was possible to get the burger that was being shared cut in half. It was a plain Jane burger and I was sure the kitchen could handle this. This resulted in a female staff member who I assume was a manager visiting my table to explain that they did not want to cut the burger because it would change the presentation(the cook wants the presentation his way) and the kitchen is really busy, \"so in order to expedite the cooking process they would prefer not to cut the burger\". This was a bit of an insult to anyone who has worked in the culinary world not to mention a paying guest.  6. The manager took a uncompromising position as I did let her know this. The server hawked over our table the remainder of the visit, most likely to try to regain any lost tip (we still tipped 20%).   In summary, the food was good, but there are plenty of burger joints in the Las Vegas area, many of which I will visit more frequently in place of Bachi Burger. They are pricey as well in comparison to more established burger joints.  The customer service aspect and the arrogant manner in which the manager handled a simple request was what drove down this experience the most. My sister reminded me on this visit that she had previously come here and the chef refused to add lettuce to a burger because \"it would change the taste profile of the food\".  Advice to the chef: despite your enthusiasm for what YOU want, what YOU want comes second to what the GUEST wants. The guest is paying for a product as well as an experience. Without us, the GUESTS, YOU are out of a job.  Advice to the manager/supervisor: If you want to help the business grow as well as add to your professional success you will have a much easier road granting a special request rather than insulting your patrons intelligence by discussing logistics of a burger kitchen. In the time it took to give your enthusiastic lecture on expediting product from the kitchen, you might have been able to cut 20 or 30 burgers or maybe even grant a simple request to go above and beyond your current set of service standards. Instead we ordered one less burger on this visit, skipped desert and probably wont be back. YOUR JOB IS TO ENSURE GUEST SATISFACTION WHILE CREATING GUEST/BRAND LOYALTY. THE GUEST IS ALWAYS RIGHT. WITHOUT THEM YOU WOULD NOT HAVE A JOB.",

To say that she was rude and disorganized would not be doing this post justice. Luckily the real hostess Stacy came to the rescue. She offered me and the hoard of people standing in what could only be considered a vestibule with one too many plants & too few chairs a cool drink while we waited. (Thank you Stacy)  Once seating became available for me to sit at the bar (about half an hour later) I was seated and given a menu. I asked the friendly couple sitting next to me what they would recommend and once they did I perused a little longer and then made my selection. I had the KiKi burger with a side of Truffle Parmesan fries & a coke.  I waited what seemed like a while but once my food came I was glad! it looked really appetizing and tasted even better!!! The flavors were dancing on my tongue and had a rhythm all their own. It felt like a party in my mouth and I was thankful for the invite. :-D",

    "text": "The food has been consistently fabulous. Most recently, I tried the Vegetarian-friendly NO MEAT HERE... \"BURGER\" and it was good. It wasn't amazing (like their other burgers), but the fact that they had a well-constructed and thoughtful dish for Vegetarians was awesome enough for me. It featured a shiitake mushroom patty, Japanese eggplant, tofu, red bean, mixed greens, and chili lime vinaigrette on a wheat bun. Pretty cool. I also LOVE their TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES and SALT & PEPPER GARLIC FRIES. The toppings are amazing and the aiolis are addicting (especially that Garlic Chili Aioli, drool). The other burgers I've enjoyed several times are the RONIN BURGER, KIKI'S BURGER, and SPICY MISO BURGER. Serious drool action all over the board. I've had the OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES once and they're pretty amazing too. Basically, I haven't had anything bad. I do enjoy the boba milk tea drinks as well. They're not the best boba drinks, but decent for a craving. The BACHI SAKE SANGRIA is really great too and unassuming.  The SHOGUN BURGER is really great! Loved the pan-seared foie gras and although I couldn't distinguish the Yamamomo Peach and Asian Pear really well, it added a nice sweetness to this rich sandwich. The Wagyu Beef was delicious as well. The Unagi seemed unnecessary though; it didn't add anything significant for me - taste or texture - and it kind of took away from the two main ingredients (Wagyu and Foie Gras). I also tried the SWEET POTATO FRIES for the first time along with my two favorite staples and it was okay. I liked the freshness and it not being salty, but with other amazing fry options, this doesn't come close.  We did have one bad customer service experience where we ended up leaving without dinner and going to another restaurant. It was a rather busy night (and I'm sure they have lots of those) and the communication with seating availability was horrendous. Especially since I had called ahead. There was lack of organization and the gentleman that appeared to be the manager poorly handled the situation. It was really disappointing. Very \"off-putting\" and since I'm a regular, it wasn't a complete deterrent, however, for my friends, it was bad enough to not warrant another visit. Not a way you want to lose customers! Otherwise, the service is just okay. Which is a real shame with food so delicious.  Update: I haven't visited this location for over a year because of my last experience. I have been to their Summerlin location a few times and prefer it MUCH more. The service is substantially better and it's not as crowded (no tourists!). I would stay away from this location.",

I was blown away with the service here, considering the late hours, Saturday night and the occasional drunks. The entire staff was extremely nice, my server (Joseph) was way nice and on the ball making sure we didn't need anything....loved him!  The food was BOMB! I'm not a fan of craziness in my burger so ordered a plain and simple 7oz Bachi Burger. The angus meat was cooked well, just as I ordered, AND still was juicy. The bun was perfectly warm, fluffy and ingredients were just the right amount.   Only thing about this place is the ridiculous add-on's. For these burger prices you would think they would come with Cheese, to the least. No. It's extra. Lol.   This is my choice when I miss In-N-Out's 1:30am cutoff. :-D",

It was pretty good, but I didn't even finish it. It was kind of bland other than the cheese, possibly because it followed some very flavorful fries.   It will become a regular stop, now that I found it.",

    "text": "So if you are in the Vegas area, and are on a Burger hunt.. We'll you've come to the right place....If you haven't been...you definitely are missing out.  So out-of-towners...If you have a rental...Bet your bottom dollar you'd wanna make the effort to come here.    The burgers are fresh, and has a spin when compared to your all american burger.  Their specialty are the burgers with the Asian twist to them.  The meat is thick and moist.  Very different, original and tasty! They have quite a few selections but I've only tried the Kiki burger and Ronin, both of which are good...wait I lied! I've also tasted the KimChi burger from a friend's plate= This burger was decent...a bit weird for me since I didn't know what to think of the kimchi veggies combined with my burger... Bachi Burger does have a small selection of your all american burgers but the waiter will advise you that people usually don't come to order those.    I've also tried their Ox tail chili cheese fries....De-LIcious!!! They even include a sunny side up on top of the thing.  :) Makes me happy just to think of this dish.  My friend ordered the bbq pork bun dish (its one of the three pictures I have up) ...I think they were good, but for the price, I think i've had better.    The only thing I think would make this burger not so appealing to people is if they are like me: I simply like less meat (like the amount you get in a cheeseburger at in N out).  I usually go with others who I gladly separate the pattie in two and hand half of it over to someone else.  The thing is, there is too much meat for me and that isn't a problem when you could share it with others (having too little would be a problem as you would have to maybe order more). :)   Come people!

    "text": "I've been here twice (can;t really be a regular from the Los Angeles area), but both experiences were impressive.  First time around, I had the Kiki.  The first bite was unexpectedly sweet, but after allowing the flavors to merge I was able to see how the sweetness fit with the profile.  I wanted a good burger, and this satisfied.  I left with a smile on my face.  I had it with a side of truffle fries.  Every visit from that point until the end of time will consist of an order of truffle fries.  While most of the truffle fries I've had are constructed with thin-cut fried and a generous coating of white truffle oil, these are not.  The fries ARE thin-cut, but the truffle flavor comes from an emulsion that is squeezed on top like it were some cheap ketchup.  Cheap ketchup this is not.  This is what every truffle wants to become when it grows up.  The second time around, I had the miyagi-san.  I was hesitant.  Some places will take something ordinary, throw some furikake on it, then call it fusion.  My hesitation was unwarranted.  The miyagi-san has become my standard at bachi.    The CFC (chili fried chicken) is a treat.  Little nuggets of sweet, spicy, crispy chicken.  Easy to enjoy up front, but enough flavor depth for a foodie to love.  Cherry Yuzu Soda...order it.  You'll want to down it.  Go ahead and down the first one.  Take the second one more slowly.  You'll enjoy it more, i promise.",

Everything was good by itself but it was a little too overwhelming flavor-wise when eaten together. I'd suggest getting a simpler order of fries if ordering a more elaborate burger or vice versa.   Something that bothered us though at this place was the abundance of flies. We kept getting harassed by a few flies during our meal and the other table next to us kept having to swat them away too. When we left, we noticed a whole swarm of them just outside the restaurant. Not sure if this is indicative of a sanitation issue but it definitely took away from our experience so taking a star off for that.",

We also order medium rare and the burgers came out medium.... so, try one one level bellow what you normally get.Not sure if it was the day or that's how they cook them, need to go again to check difference doneness.

Today after waiting 40 minutes we watched as our table was given away to a group that had just arrived.  The hostess was indifferent to the fact that we had been waiting and this was the last straw.

The first time we were there, we ordered as main course the Veggie burger, Ronin burger, and Sweet potato fries.  The veggie burger was ok.  The Ronin burger on the other hand was delicious. It has so many flavors.  It contains a cross between american and asian ingridients. Also, the sweet potato fries are as good as they get. Lightly salted and crispy. So the second time around we stuck to  Ronin Burgers and sweet potato fries.    As far as service, service was great.  We were seated immediately. A glass of Iced water is served right away and our food was ready in 10-15 mins.  I have been there during the week either on a Tuesday or Wednesday and there are always many empty tables. I have read other reviews where they mention how crowded it gets.  So I would recommend to go there during the week in the evening preferably.    All in all, I will be going back soon to try some of their other fries which I hear are amazing.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I would give more stars if the service wasn't lacking so much. We first arrived, the front area was packed. It was about a 10-15 minute wait. There was nowhere to stand or sit inside, so waited outside. The man told us he would come and get us when our table was ready. No one came for us so my husband went in to check to see how much longer the wait was and they just happened to be calling his name (they said they were going to come and get us, so I don't know why they were calling his name). The front area definitely needs to be managed better and set up differently. It seems way too small.  The server was nice but she seemed like she was overly busy. She wasn't very attentive at all. Her mind seemed to be elsewhere. We ordered our drinks and it took her a while to get them back to us. My husband was annoyed because his beer wasn't cold and the glasses weren't frosted (when she told us they were). The glasses were like shot glasses. I've never seen a beer glass so small. Is that the new thing? Maybe I'm out of the loop, lol.   The food was good but nothing I was amazed by. We ordered a side of fries for our son and we loved the pineapple ketchup it came with. That was yummy. We also started off with the oxtail chili fries. My husband really enjoyed them, me not so much. They were too spicy for me because of the jalapenos and I was also wondering where the oxtail meat was? There was also barely any beans. The fries were a bit overcooked too for my liking. Some of them were way too crunchy. Also, when the fries first arrived at our table, the egg was already broken. That's no fun!   For our entrees, we split the Peking Duck Steamed buns and the Ronin burger. The duck buns were very good with the hoisin sauce. The buns were steamed perfectly and the fried egg mimicked cheese. They were definitely delicious. I'd like to try the pork belly buns. The biggest disappointment of the night was the Ronin burger. We would have been extremely satisfied if they cooked it medium like we requested. The burger came out well done. They cooked the angus beef way too much. We don't like sending food back so we just ate it as is. However, we did let the waitress know that they overcooked it. The flavors of the burger were delicious though. If they cooked it medium then it would have been great. The cole slaw, fried egg, onions, and aioli had a great taste. The bun was also grilled a bit too much.   The decor was cool but there was a big eyesore out on the front deck of the restaurant. There is a pile of old cooking equipment outside which makes it look really unprofessional. At the end of our meal, we felt like we were being rushed out by the waitress. My husband wasn't even finished his beer and the waitress came over asking if we needed the credit card settled. We hadn't even gave her a credit card so I don't know why she thought that. Her mind was definitely lost. Overall, the place is good but has potential to be better than it is if they fix a few things.",

The burger had slices of pork, shrimp, pate and a pork patty along with a side of pickled radish, carrots and cilantro. Overall, taste was very unique but not something I would eat again. I much prefer the real Banh Mi over this burger.  Kiki's Burger- This had bacon, mushrooms and caramelized onions with a garlic chili aioli. This burger was amazing. Everything complemented each other and the beef was definitely moist and juicy.  Truffle Parmesan Fries- very good and it was nice and crispy.   Just Fries with Pineapple Ketchup- this was also very tasty and the ketchup was a great touch to it.",

    "text": "I randomly read about this place on Yelp and since I was going to be in Vegas, I decided to try it out.  It's nice to eat off the Strip sometimes.  It is definitely oddly located, and we missed it at first.  It was pretty dead for lunch, so we didn't have to wait long to get our food.  So we asked about the beef, and it turns out that the beef comes from Kansas and some other corn states.  The waiter had to ask someone in the back, but he said that the cows are grass fed.  They ground all the meat in-house.  Prices are definitely on the pricier side considering the portions.  In fact, my friend had to order another burger to split w/ someone bc he was still hungry.  All the burgers had a similar taste - I think the patties were glazed with some sort of sweet sauce, but the toppings made a difference.  We tried three burgers, and all were good, though I liked the Bachi Burger the best.    -Bachi Burger, Kalbi Burger, and Bahn Mi Burger - I'd recommend all of them, though the Kalbi Burger was nothing special.  The kim chee they use is not spicy at all and is made from regular cabbage.   -Pork Belly Buns - Good but not filling at all.   You get two tiny buns.  Nice for a snack, maybe. -Truffle Parmesan Fries - Shoestring crispy fries.  Yummy!!  We also asked for a side of the pineapple ketchup - they should really bottle that stuff.   -Hawaiian Sea Salt Coffee ($3.50) - This had an interesting taste bc the whipped cream was made w/ salt.  It wasn't as sweet as I would have liked but it was definitely different.  Another friend came later and ordered the turkey/chicken burger, but it never came.  Apparently the waiter forgot, so she ended up canceling it after waiting a long time.  The bill came to about $51, not including tip.  Our waiter, who reminded me of Jimmy Fallon but taller, was nice and did his best to answer all our questions.  I'd definitely come back my next trip to Vegas, though I wish the portions were bigger!!  PS:  The website says they are open daily from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. but they had a sign on the door stating they close at 10 p.m. on Sundays.  Not sure which is True, but I'd go with the sign!",

    "text": "After a day of slingin cookies for Rise Up Japan, I needed some fuel. I am rarely on this side of town and this has been on the list of curiosities for a while.  The BF and I shared:  Ronin ($8,Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, Sweet Bread Bun, Yuzu Citrus Aioli) - from the description, you can clearly see there was a lot going on. Somehow it worked for me but I think it's because those are familiar flavors I would find in a bento lunch but I know for some folks this won't work. It was very rich  specially when you're biting through the egg yolk area. You didn't need the yuzu aioli sauce served on the side (I ended up dipping fries in it). Both the BF and I were glad we split since neither of us can really eat a whole of that flavor.   KiKi ($8, Sauteed Shiitake & Eryngi mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Ciabatta Bun, Garlic Chili Aioli on the side ) I love me mushroom and onion burgers and happy that they were generous on the onions and mushrooms in it. I did use the chili aioli to add a bit of zing to it to balance the rich earthiness and sweetness of the toppings.  Truffle Fries ($4)- they drizzle a bit of truffle gravy on the fries but I wish they just give you that on the side. The fries were crisp and light and well seasoned.   They had a bunch of different drinks and I respect their nicely selected craft beers, but I was just feeling on a simple and refreshing matcha ice green tea.   Overall, service was friendly and decent with keeping up on the drinks.   I liked the sweet bun on the burger. I thought the meat was good quality, juicy and cooked right. I think the concept is good and I am curious to try more of their offerings. However, I don't think I would drive all the way from the NW to come down to eat here. If we're in Town Square I think this will be something I'd much rather go to instead of eating in the mall.",

    "text": "Saw this place on Diners Drive Ins and Dive a while back.   It looked amazing during the show so naturally once in Vegas, this was the first restaurant we hit up.   Its way off the strip which is the first plus.   The service here is a below par.  The first trip was just slow, and the second, there was one guy doing all the serving while two lazy ass girls stood in the back drying silverware and a guy in a suit stood and watched. Now to the food.  The oxtail chili fries are the best chili fries I have ever had in my life.  The mixture with the garlic aoli and jalapeno's are sooooo good.  They put a fried egg on top which was ok the first time.  The next time we went I got it without the egg and found it to be much more appetizing.  The egg just didnt go well with everything else IMO.  The pork belly sliders were ok.  The pork belly seemed to have been cooked a while before we arrived and it was really dry.  The flavor was good though.   Food gets a 4.5, but subtract half a star for the slow service. Pros:  Really good food, positive and upbeat atmosphere, location, staff is friendly. Cons: Service is slow.",

    "text": "I love asian fusion burgers, e.g., Fukuburger.  It actually reminds me of a burger I had on my honeymoon in the Cook Islands -- hello, egg!     These are gourmet burgers, so some burgers are slightly more pricey than the average burger at a restaurant.  But it's so worth it!  According to one waitress, the popular burgers tend to be the Ronin burger and Kiki's burger.  I can attest that the Kiki burger is delicious; the ingredients mesh together such that they complement each other (sweet and tangy) and there's no one overwhelming flavor.           And the fries -- oh, the fries! The burgers don't come with fries, so you gotta order them separately.  The salt and pepper garlic fries are simply a must try.  The fries are shoestring, with cilantro and jalapenos.  Just a great combination of ingredients that results in french fried goodness! And without the need of excessive drenching in sauce.  As a tip, the front entrance to the restaurant is NOT the door facing Windmill.  The place is in a strip mall (surprise, surprise), and there's a walkway and door on the Windmill side.  BUT, the entrance is actually on the other side -- facing inside the strip mall.    I'm a fan of this place and will definitely return!",

After seeing so many Yelpers recommending the Shogun Burger, I ordered that while my boyfriend ordered the Spicy Miso Burger. The beef patty for the Shogun Burger was so juicy and flavorful whereas the Spicy Miso Burger was just meh. Definitely make a stop at Bachi Burger if you love gourmet burgers and you're in town. Don't worry about the $25 price tag on the Shogun Burger; it's so worth it.",

With burgers that are high quality and entirely unique, and drinks that you'll remember (Jasmine Lemonade is a personal favorite), Bachi Burger is a can't-go-wrong place when you have a bit of money to spend.  Unfortunately the prices are bit high, so you probably won't want to eat there all the time, but with lots of specials and new things to try, there's always a reason to go back.  I don't know where these other people with bad reviews ate, but I've never had a problem with the service at all.  They're always very friendly and while they could be a bit more prompt, there's no complaint here!    First timers should try the Truffle Parmesan Fries, Jasmine Lemonade, and the Kiki's Burger.  I recommend the Banh-Mi Burger, but it probably wouldn't be for everyone's palate.",

With a large comfy couch nestled off to the side, walls displaying pieces by local artists and Jack Johnson and Dave Matthews streaming out of the sound system, it's just like being hanging out with friends at home but with delish eats that I would never be able to pull off.  There are burgers of all types that sound so good you are thinking about what you want to try on your next visit before you've even ordered.  The pickle plate is a crispy, tangy beauty with fun items like lemongrass and ginger.  The ronin burger was a garlic lover's dream and even had a perfectly cooked egg on top.  The crab cake burger was soft and perfectly seasoned.  Try it with their yuzu aioli for added zest.  The garlic & pepper, sweet potato and parmesan truffle fries were all wonderful but the dipping sauces were all beyond compare.  After polishing every delicious bite you probably won't have any room for dessert so take a bag of their homemade toffee home to enjoy for the rest of the week.  The only complaint is that so many others already share my love of Bachi Burger and had beat me to the punch on this Sunday evening, leaving the restaurant sold out of edamame, the grilled marinated cod burger and the cherry  pop tart dessert.  No worries, as they are all waiting patiently at the top of my \"to do\" list for next weekend's Bachi Burger outing.",

But overall the food was absolutely wonderful.   I'm giving this restaurant three stars though because of the service. I came in and had to wait almost an hour and a half for my food to come out. It wasn't jam packed busy either so I don't know what the deal was. Also, every other time I come, the waiters take a while to ring up my check. Like an extremely long while. Like I should order another burger to kill time. There isn't a hostess either so you pretty much just wait until a server sees you and seats you.   As for price, I went in with my boyfriend a few times and for two burgers two drinks and one side of fries, our bill came to about $35 which isn't bad overall. I'd probably come here again but not cause of the service, but for the amazing burgers.",

    "text": "Service: 3 Food: after having it the first time I rated it a 5. Now after the second time it's 3.5-4   We came here on a sat night knowing there will be a wait. We put our names down and was told that for a party of 5 it's going to be 30-45 min wait. Exactly 30 mins later we checked back in and it seems like they have already crossed our names out (we weren't waiting outside of the restaurant we walked around).  We were told that unfortunately they would have to rewrite our names on the bottom of their list again since we left the area. I personally have never heard of that rule or ever been to any restaurant that practices that so I tried reasoning with the hostess. Long story short turns out that they could \"make something happen\" and that there's another party just leaving and we will get seated right after. Our waitress was really nice and did a good job at recommending different menu items but she didn't check back in with us very often to see how things are going and if we needed anything.   I remembered the burgers being amazing the first time I tried them. However this time not so much, my burger tasted a lot more saltier than I remembered and to my liking. We got the truffle fries and a side of pineapple ketchup. I mean I LOVE pineapple so I just HAD to try it. It taste just like ketchup that's a little on the sweeter side but other than that I don't taste anything different. I'm guessing it's just ketchup mixed with pineapple juice but who knows! I got the \"banh mi\" burger and the bf got the Ronin Burger. Banh mi burger...like I mentioned was pretty salty, but I think that might be because the pickled carrot was not made correctly. I tasted the carrot on its own and it was extreme salty and nasty so I had to take it out of my burger. Other than that little hiccup..everything was wonderful. The bf loved his burger I mean you can't go wrong with a juicy patty and fried egg! OH did I mention their flavored soda is ammmaazzingggg! I've tried the apple lychee, the peach one, as well as orange tangerine and every single one is great!    Overall experience was great. Def will be back again.",

    "text": "Burgers re-imagined in the style of popular Asian comfort food...fusion disaster or synergistic food nirvana?  That was the question I sought to answer when I stepped into this southeastern joint with my sister visiting from out of town and two other friends.    Beginning with an appetizer:  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries \"garnished\" with a sunny side up egg...let that concept wrinkle your brain for a minute,  Portion is definitely worthy of sharing with 4.   Shaq would have better luck winning a game of Jenga than my attempting to eat this with one's hands without making a hot mess.   Armed with forks, we broke the egg all across the beautiful pastiche of crisp golden fries, hearty oxtail chili, and luscious gooey cheese that harmonized in a beautiful symphony of texture and flavor.    The hardest part was deciding on burgers, so we each agreed to order a distinct burger and cut them into quarters for all to sample.  Although the waiter suggested we order them medium, I think we chose wisely with medium rare.  Burger #1 The Ronin  In the movie Ronin, when DeNiro's character is asked about how he avoids an ambush, he replies \"Whenever there is any doubt, there is no doubt.\"  When I glanced at the description and read the reviews of my trusty Yelpers on what appears to be the gold standard of the Bachi Burgers, I had no doubts this one was going to be a winner.  Perfectly cooked patty topped with some nuttiness from miso-goma dressing, tanginess from Katsu bbq sauce, crunch from the Japanese slaw, binded together with the runny yolk of a fried egg and then slathered with a citrus-yuzu aioli, if you haven't started drooling on your keyboard, perhaps you need to get your salivary glands checked out.  Burger #2 The Kalbi Burger  Somewhat of a misnormer since they use ground beef and pork rather than the marbly beef short rib from which its name sake is inspired, but nonetheless well executed.  Along with a korean-inspired mayo, green onions, and a healthy punch of kimchee, the flavor profile is great although I would have preferred a stronger spice component with hotter chili paste.  Nice touch with a banchan accompaniment of spicy korean pickles.  Burger #3 \"The Crusty Crab's replacement\"  Can't recall the name of this one since it was one of the specials and is supposed to be the replacement for The Crusty Crab, which was essentially a crabcake sandwich, but this one is like a Steak Oscar between two pieces of bread so I'll temporarily call it the Krabby patty, in honor of Spongebob Squarepants.  Beef patty topped with crab, scallop, a fried egg, and some crispy vegetable component that has slipped my mind, Plankton would gladly hatch a scheme to serve this burger to compete with the Krusty Krabs.     Burger #4 Spicy Miso Burger  Highlights include Angus beef, roasted garlic, apple vinaigrette (side note: totally would have missed this word in a spelling bee because of that sneaky extra i), and shishito peppers.  This one was like the cute girl next door standing alongside the other three supermodels of burgers.  Nothing to complain about, but not much of a revelation either.  The finely shredded lettuce has a propensity to lose its crunch amongst the liquid components without providing any added flavors like a spicy arugula.  Don't be intimidated by the name, as shishito peppers are not considered anywhere close to spicy as its other Asian cousins in Chinese or Thai cuisine...not really sure if I could even make it out, which probably relates to the final point: the apple vinaigrette overpowers the other mild components so that you don't get the popping off of distinct flavors as in the other burgers.  In summary, the patties were well seasoned and sufficiently moist, the brioche-like bun is probably personal preference since it is soft and heavy as opposed to light and toasty (reminds me of the baked pork buns at dim sum), although I would have to say the Ronin comes closest to living up to Barney Stinson's highest compliment for any budding burger connoisseur:  \"I love this burger so much I wanna sew my ass shut!\"",

    "text": "55% Not bad. Burgers are so-so & a bit gimmicky, but the rest of menu deserves recognition.  ***Short Review  Came here for lunch on a weekend on Jul '11.  Cooking here has an obvious Asian influence. I feel knowing what to order may be key here, as some ideas work better than others.  Wagyu smokey-mountain burger (around $18) was so-so. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=H5rikXxhih1j-arkh9vnqA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN...</a> The patty was a bit too lean and lacked flavor. The condiments were overpoweringly sweet and overwhelmed the beef patty. I don't think this was a very well thought out burger.  Oxtail chili-cheese fries here were orgasmic. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=CuZzpQ4AZSIOQ-mQYsPf-w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN...</a> It's a large mound of thin fries topped with heaps of minced delicious  ox-tail, and topped with a fried egg. Portions are enough for 2-4 ppl to make a meal out of. Come here for this if nothing else.  Ambiance is so-so. The place is comfortable enough, but the interior is very generic suburban. Wait times are a tad lengthy, it took me around 30 mins to get my burger.   Service is about average. Value is very reasonable, although some items present a better value than others.  Far from my favorite burger, but overall not a bad place at all. Definitely worth the drive from the strip if you want to try something a little different.  Avoid if more typical Asian inspired fusion cooking isn't your thing.    ***Detailed Review  Wagyu smokey-mountain burger (approx $18) (Dish Rating, 30%)  Beef cuts used were chuck and rib-eye.  Cows were fed, if i recall correctly, a combination of hay, potatoes, corn, & wheat.  I was hoping this would provide a more robust and distinct flavor profile, but it turned out quite bland.  I ordered my burger rare, and it did come out that way.  However, the meat was fairly lean and didn't have too many juices.  Typically when I cut into a 'rare' burger, the meat is red.  Here its strangely more brown.  It might as well be 'mystery meat'.  Perhaps medium rare or medium might yield more satisfying results.    I've noticed a lack of flavor and fat content (but added tenderness in texture) with any burgers from Snake Rivers Wagyu, and this has been the case in my experience for other restaurant that offer the same beef.  It is important to note that some of the burger characteristics might come from the meat supplier, rather than the chef's preparation.  Skip the next paragraph if you're not interested in the details.  I've noticed that some of the patties are made by Snake Rivers are pre-prepared & frozen on site, as opposed to being made from scratch by the restaurant itself.  I'm not certain that this is the case, but it may be a possibility.  It's also important to note that I'm not implying the beef from Snake Rivers isn't to my liking, as I don't recall trying their steaks yet and therefore can't say.  I have provided a few links on Snake Rivers.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.snakeriverfarms.com%2Fhamburger&s=2eb77e7cb655f10a928a25ea3447c9cc4781aece31fa9528f437b4242b535eb4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">snakeriverfarms.com/hamb...</a> <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.snakeriverfarms.com%2FSnakeRiverFarms%2Fwagyu&s=a81016da007f66c0ccc37cbf4232ffd4a394a4f1fc1edb2874ebd35cbf1bc306\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">snakeriverfarms.com/Snak...</a>  You may get a much better burger experience here if you keep it simple with the condiments offered.  Because the flavor of the patty isn't particularly robust, I feel more subtly flavored condiments would work best.   The condiments used on my smokie mountain burger sounded interesting on paper, but turned out to be a mess.  Condiments used (heirloom tomatoes, truffle butter, what resembled caramelized onions, and some other ingredients I didn't find memorable) weren't balanced and gave the burger an overwhelmingly undistinguished mush of sweet flavors and mismatched textures.  Flavor of the otherwise bland patty was overwhelmed entirely.  The bun is more brioche-like.  It's nice and holds the burger well, but I felt was a tad hard in texture.  There was also more bread than I would have liked, so I opted to eat it open faced instead.  Overall this wasn't the worst burger I've had, but certainly not my favorite by quite a bit.  'Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries' were to die for.  This is where I felt Bach did a great job, using  their succulent minced oxtail, covered with jalapeno peppers, beans, (cheddar?) cheese, fried egg, mixed over a mound of fries.  Flavors here are very robust and well paired together.  The oxtail offers the most prominent flavor, but it's complemented well by the beans, peppers, and fries.  The flavors felt very Vietnamese to me.    Fries used are similar to a McDonald's cut.  They are quite crispy and light.  Seasoning used is minimal and they're good by themselves,   The absurdly large portion size was another wonderful bonus.  I felt it resembled more like a super decadent poutine dish.  Highly recommended.  82%  Looking back, I feel Bachi is capable of delivering some very solid ideas and cooking, but it isn't always consistent.  I doubt I could ever enjoy their burgers if no changes are made, but that's not to say they don't offer some other great choices.  Not bad",

    "text": "Based on raving recommendations from my friends, I had high hopes for this place. The long wait probably added to my anticipation too. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed. Either that or I was hungover from last night's festivities... but I don't think so...   I was very excited to try the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and they were good, but they didn't blow me away.   The burgers on the menu seemed carefully crafted and included pan-Asian tastes and flavors. It is a gourmet burger joint, so it wasn't cheap, but it wasn't incredibly expensive either.   I chose to build my own burger because all the burgers on the menu seemed to have one ingredient that I wasn't fond of. I didn't want to build a burger that was too big for my appetite, in fear that I wouldn't enjoy it, but I probably should've added all of those extras to counter the sweet patty. However, I'm not sure if the price of that would have sat right with me. Anyway... not that the meat was not cooked right--it was quality meat, juicy and well-seasoned--but I just did not enjoy my burger. Maybe it's just me, but when I go for burgers, I expect an all-American tasting burger patty instead of a teriyaki taste. Other people at my table agreed that their burger was overly sweet as well... but what do you expect from a place called Bachi burger--derived from hibachi I assume.   I would like to come back and try other non-burger items on the menu. Drink-wise, I tried the honeydew milk tea and it tasted like a Melona bar in drink form--yum :) I had to get it to go before the long drive back to OC!",

There's a good chance you'll come, eat a burger and decide that it's one of the best burgers you've ever had. Among your top 10 even top 5. This is how I feel about the burgers. Everything else on the menu? Craptastic. I mean, just garbage. The coffee taste like water, their cocktail barely had liquor in it, the dessert like some supermarket bought concoction, it just goes on. So just don't order anything else but the burger.",

The egg yolk dripping down the side of my burger was the finishing touch to this flavorful masterpiece. The parmesan cheese fries on the other hand, were anything but amazing. Had I known they were going to be lacking in flavor, I would have ordered them original with a side of ketchup. The waitress was attentive and not in the fill your glass of water every 5 seconds kind of way... We all know how annoying that can be! I will definitely go back as soon as I can. I will continue experimenting with all the different burgers in search for the best one. Any place that makes eating a \"burger\" an amazing experience is my kind of place.

I tried the Kiki Burger which was great since I'm a fan of burgers with mushrooms. The Garlic Chili Aioli that came with it was really tasty.   I also tried the Crusty Crab Cake sandwich which was delicious. The crab cake was nice and thick and probably too much for the bread to hold. They really don't skimp on the amount of crab here. I also liked that they put avocado to pair with the crab cake. They also add mango and tangerine jam for a sweet contrast.  The sweet potatoe fries here are outstanding. Each one is crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  I'll need to stop by everytime I'm in Vegas.",

The only downside is the burger buns tend to get soggy quick because the meat is so juicy. The food also takes awhile to come out...I understand it's not fast food, but it seems to take a lot longer than it should. The parmesan truffle fries are so good, I can't get away from ordering them even though I keep telling myself I need to try some of their other fries (salt/pepper or sweet potato). If none of their specialty burgers are to your liking, you can make your own custom burger with a variety of options and toppings. They have kobe beef too!  They also have an extensive drink menu with home-made sodas and even Thai iced tea :D I'd recommend trying the apple lychee soda...so refreshing! For the alkies out there, they also have a wine & sake menu!",

    "text": "Believe the hype - Bachi Burger is really good! Not only are the burgers really good, but the toppings and flavors are all really interesting and exotic. They have standard cheeseburgers as well, for those who don't want to branch out, but for anyone interested, they have burgers with all kinds of different Asian toppings (slaw, kimchee chi, different cheeses and bacons, lots of mushrooms, sauces, etc). Even for specialty burgers, the price is pretty good, unless you get up into the really fancy stuff (wagyu, crab, foie gras, etc).  My husband and I went and got one 'normal' specialty burger (I can't remember the name - Ronin maybe? It's the first one on the menu) and one of the more extreme (blue & green or something like that), an order of truffle fries, and one beer. Both burgers were REALLY GOOD, but I preferred the Ronin. The bacon on the other one was just a little too overpowering for me. Truffle fries were excellent as well. The whole thing cost $40 with tip and we had plenty of leftovers (not that you could save them long - the burgers are so loaded with sauces & wet toppings that they're soggy in an hour).  There was a decent-sized crowd in there on a Friday night, service was very prompt and friendly, and I love that it's near my neighborhood. MOST IMPORTANTLY - Bachi Burger is unlike anything else in the area! I love a great, new, unique, independent restaurant that's NOT on the strip!  Really, the review is only 4.5 stars because of one thing - the decor/ambiance inside the restaurant. It's kinda bland and the lights seem to be too bright, but because of everything else, I'm rounding up to 5.  I wish Bachi Burger all the success in the world so they can become longtime residents in the area and maybe inspire some other unique independent places!",

A restaurant that centers around offering quality burgers with an Asian flair. The price is on par for the burgers although they now offer a Wagyu beef burger for $23. Yeah. Kind of steep but I heard it's somewhat worth the price by dinner companions who ordered it.  I wish I could give them a 3.5 because the wait for our food was LONG and it wasn't even busy.   I ordered the Kiki's burger. It was as if all the right components were there but something was missing. Maybe salt? It needed something to transform it from good/really good to orgasmic.  The parmesan truffle fries were bomb though. Also, our server was really nice.",

    "text": "Asian Fusion Burgers...sounds interesting.  So my last day in vegas  I thought I would check this spot out since it was very close to the Cancun where my friends were staying at.  We decided to call in our order a head of time since it was a pretty large order to go.  We decided to order the Ronin, Kiki, Kalbi, and Banh Mi. Im a big fan of peking duck so we also ordered the steamed sandwiches in beef short rib and pork belly.  Hahaha the order keeps goin we also ordered the sweet potato fries parm truffle fries, and porteguese donuts.  Burgers: All burgers were cooked medium $ 9.00 each Ronin-  Im not a big fan of coleslaw  so this wasnt my favorite Banh Mi- With the all the fixings(jalapeno, cilantro, and special sauce) I actually was surprisingly good...it worries me when they call it banh mi and its not actually viet banh mi...but a good twist to their version. Kiki- I like all the mushrooms on this burger and the aioli i think is what made it good. Kalbi- This one my friend like and she isnt found of spicy.    Its the sauces and special dressings on the burger that really make them work.  Steamed Sandwiches: 3 pieces each Peking duck - love peking duck.. Their version comes with eggs which was different for me. $ 12.50 Beef Short rib- my friend john really liked this version. The meat was very tender. $ 14.00 Pork Belly- This one I really like the best.. Marinate pork belly that is grilled.....hmmm pork!!! $ 12.00  Fries: $ 4.00 each Sweet Potato fries- I have had better they were a bit dry. Parm Truffle fries- interesting and different. For 4 bucks each I was expecting a bigger serving or fries.  My friends asked what is the brown sauce stuff on it...hahah I guess the truffle oil sauce!  Portugese donuts: $5.00 for 4 pieces w/ vanilla ice cream they were basicly cake donut holes rolled in cinnamon and sugar. I never tried them before but my friend loves portugese donuts. He actually like them a lot...to me they were a lil dense but I assume they are supposed to be like that.  Service: The guy at the registar and who helped me with my order was very nice.  He even asked me where the party is at since i ordered a lot of food. I laughed to myself and told him um no where we are just having dinner at the Cacun resort.  \"Oh can I come too!\" LOL! He was a reallly nice guy and he helped me carry out my order to my car.  He even offered me water or soda while I was waiting for my order to be ready.  Nice change from the strip where all the wait staff are very superficial and too good to be working where they are working at.    The restaurant itself was nice.  I thought I was at the wrong place cuz it is actually set up very nice not like no regular fast food chain. Its an actually set down place.    Would I go back to eat here again when I visit vegas..most likely.  I really like the Pork belly steamed sandwich a lot.  But they are a bit pricey. For peking duck 14 bucks for 3 pieces is alot...i can order a freaking whole duck for that and the steam buns.",

I scored a single spot at the bar right away- the advantage of traveling solo.   I had the steamed bun with pork belly and truffled fries, both excellent. If I had to nit pick, I'd say the truffle gravy is a bit strange, and the pink dipping sauce along side is a distraction. Possibly consider moving the truffle gravy to the dipping sauce location and just toss those crispy thin fries with truffle oil.  Sunday, on my way out of Vegas, they were not serving at the bar, so I waited 35 minutes for my one-top table. Service was fast and efficient. I had my old favorite, the banh mi burger and their onion rings- which are amazing. Thinly sliced and tempura battered- perfectly crisp.   This is a don't miss spot- although you need to plan for a wait, it's well worth it!",

Service was great; but this is no fast food burger joint, and it was well worth the 10 or 12 minutes. Parmesan-truffle fries were a fine accompaniment, cooked the size and crispness I liked, and the drizzle of sauce was just the right amount. There was a little extra aioli for each item. and while I like them all, both the burgers and the fries were awesomely self sufficient. I'll be back with my wife (I'll drop the kids at McD's) again, and often. I think trying every menu item before the end of the year is a laudable goal.

Unfortunately, the service was extremely slow, taking 35 minutes to get our food.  On top of this, the waitress did not come one time to check on us.  When we asked about getting our fries, they informed us that it was up to us to ask them to bring it out before our burgers if we wanted the fries first (even though they automatically brought us our fries first on our last visit).  We ordered the peking duck steamed buns, which were very good, but not as good as burgers.  We also ordered the sliders, to which they forgot to add the fried eggs we had wanted.  The waitress gave us a %10 discount for all these mistakes and the slowness of the service, but I left feeling very dissatisfied.  I can understand the wait if the restaurant was packed, but almost 40 minutes for food when the restaurant is less than half full is incomprehensible to me, especially when the waitress doesn't even come to check on you.",

What a delicious combination! The burger and fries are good to share if you aren't starving. The juices from this burger is like no other. Definitely a go-to pit stop before or after Vegas.  From my experience the service was pretty good. Our waiter went out of the way to wish my friend and I a Happy Birthday, also. But I can understand why other people on this yelp page complain about service - - I got some nasty looks from other servers, but I'm not gonna let that take away from my own waiter and yummy food.  I'll be back!",

Burgers were well prepared, and the flavor combinations were interesting and tasty. Plus their truffle fries were delicious.   Their ramen sucks. They got the appearance right, but their broth was just awful, and the pork belly was reminiscent of dried bacon. I actually ended sending back a tonkotsu black garlic (which I rarely do), and requested the more forgiving spicy miso...which also disappointed.

I thought the oxtail fries would have chunks of meat, but it's just basic ass chili cheese fries with an egg on top. Also, its sweet. Why?! :(  The ronin burger was good, I would say 4/5. The bun was really soft and fluffy. This was sweet as well, which I would usually like, but with the overly sweet fries, it was a sugar overload.  The pork belly bao were okay, not bad but not amazing. Would not order again. The best part of the meal was the burger and my strawberry lemonade.  Unless a friend was really craving Bachi, I wouldn't bother making another trip out.",

I'm sorry, but don't even think of selling this perfect burger without all of the ingredients.  With this being the case today, I couldn't believe they wouldn't even offer some kind of discount for a burger that wasn't complete.  The Bahn Mi burger is suppose to have shrimp in the patty.  This was left out and I was given a plain patty.  I left there without giving a tip for the first time ever.    I gave the stars I did today because the truffle fries and the pork buns were spot on as always.  I removed stars because of the lapse in judgement in recommending an incomplete product and not thinking of giving a discount of any kind.",

    "text": "Great burgers, but not my favorite location.   Environment: It was my first time coming to this location, and while it was the busiest of any other location I have been to, I would say it does not have the best interior. The floor plan is not very open and makes the restaurant feel a little long and disjointed as opposed to the more open floorplans of the other locations which I have been to. However, they do have different types of seating such as a patio and a bar which could appeal to some other types of people.  Food: As with any location of Bachi Burger, the burgers are great. My go-to is the Spicy Miso Burger, which has a fried egg and shishito peppers which are the standout ingredients in my opinion. Additionally, I have tried other burgers before and am delighted with each one. From the appetizer list the oxtail chili cheese fries are great and filling, however if you are looking for something lighter I would go for the pork belly bao buns which are nice and light and don't fill you up too much to the point where you won't be able to finish your burger. I have tried a couple cocktails here however I wouldn't particularly recommend them. They don't have a ton of flavor and are either too strong or too bland in my opinion.  Service: Service was okay, but not the best. After waiting and being sat the staff did seem like they were busy but it was somewhat unorganized, with multiple people coming up and trying to take our orders for different things, making it a little confusing to know who is exactly was our server. Despite this everyone was nice and personable and it is not something I would fault them for to the point where I would be deterred from coming again.  All in all, this location is closer to home for me, however I think I would rather wait to get Bachi Burger until a day I'm on the other side of town to go to another location just for the environment and the availability",

I kinda wanted the yolk of the egg to be a little runny but it wasn't.   The flavors all together was spot on.  Burger was flavorful and tender.   Bun was a winner.   I wish it came with some fries but that's how things go.   We got the truffle garlic fries and it was enough to share with 4 people.  They were a little slow refilling sodas but other than that, the service was very good.  If I wanted a delicious burger and was feeling okay with spending $15 for it, I would definitely go to Bachi Burger.",

On the Bachi Burger side of the menu, gotta give some credit to their oxtail chili fries.   Oxtail Fries are definitely a shareable portion - eat them alone and you may or may not be too full before you touch your burger.   Burger-wise. There are angus and waygu beef options, waygu is 3/4 dollars more expensive. Well constructed and tasty burgers here!",

With all that being said I knew I had to, just had to try your food.   First off, I need to say that I will try it again and try sow thing different! So I made a take out order of the wagyu burger with lettuce, tomato & onion with an order of fries.  The fries were shoestring style cut and ok, maybe if I eat in then they would be crispier.  Now for the burger. Ordered it med, which it was! Nice thick burger sandwiched between a delicious bun. However, it had no taste. I know the meat is the star of the show but it had no seasoning. Now I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like this or not so I'll have to try again but for a first experience....disappointed!  I hope that the flavor doesn't just come from all the different sauces or specialty burgers, the taste of a  plain burger will set standard for their other burgers.   I plan on giving it another try next time I'm in Vegas, hoping for better.",

I believe they forget they are at work and are to layed back and unprofessional around the restaurant. The building is layed out backwords the 2 entrances are rediculous. this is just negative feedback that could help this gold mine. a little pricy for my taste, But my KIKI BURGER WAS FANTASTIC. And the front of the restaurant faces windmill ave. and they are storing broken equipment from the kitchen in plain view of guests really? they need to get this together. The triple D show is gonna have people flock here so get it together.",

    "text": "MMMmmm. Pretty dang good. Definitely a different spin on burgers. Not traditional, and would not recommend someone who is in search of the 50's diner burger.   Asian inspired and innovative! They serve a variety of different kinds of drinks like lychee green apple soda and other unique sodas (no refills though). The macha green tea is delishhh and plenty of refills. We did not have to ask for a refill for our green tea, very attentive staff.   So far, I have yet to try any beef burgers. I've got the \"Lonely Bird\" and the \"Crusty Crab.\" I would definitely recommend the Crusty Crab because it was light and delicately flavorful...  Only complaint, and not much of a complaint, but I wish fries came equipped with a burger... but how can something as delicious as truffle fries come with an already delicious burger... it's almost a sin.",

I almost want to retract my previous review of the Ronin being the Death Row burger. The spicy miso burger is definitely a knife-and-forker. The lonely bird was a picker-upper and held it's own. I swear everytime I come here and think that I had already tried the best burger, something new proves me wrong. Never a dull moment in the food adventure at Bachi Burger. Thanks to Melissa our server today for the recommendation! You guys are awesome!",

    "text": "I had suggested Bachi to a co-worker before I tried it because I mistakenly assumed that this place, as its namesake suggests, sells only  beef-based burgers.  After he went 3 times in a week, filling me with stories of a crabcake burger that blew him away... well, I had to see for myself.    My girl and I met for lunch and both ordered the Crabcake Burger.  Based on the reviews, I asked her to meet me early... but then got lost trying to find this place since it's sort of tucked into the back of a random strip mall on Windmill.  It was almost exactly noon when I walked in and, while there were certainly people in the resto, it wasn't packed the way I was expecting it to be.    Service was quick and efficient and... when the Crabcake Burger came out... the angels sang.  It was wholesome deliciousness that I hoped wouldn't end.  The crabcake was slightly spicy and had a hint of asian flavor... and the battered, fried onion ring perched on the cake was just the right touch.    Loved Bachi and am looking forward to going back.  Also, for those vegetarians among us, there are options for you too!! While I didn't sample, there are soy veggie burgers on this menu that sounded delish!",

It's a messy, salty burger with all kinds of stuff - egg, onion rings, bacon.  It is oooh so tasty. I had the Lonely Bird on my next visit.  That's their poultry burger (as if you couldn't figure that one out).  It's very good as well. I've tried a few of their different fries as well.  My favorite is their Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries.  I'm glad my server informed me that their are jalapenos in it even though I did not see that listed on their menu.  It made want it even more.  And more I shall have on my next trip to Vegas.",

It was very hearty, I did not miss the meat!  The sandwich was so huge that I had to use a fork and knife to eat it.  The bun was the best bun i've every had with a burger, wish I could have taken a dozen home with me.  We also ordered the truffle fries and I tasted my friends Ox tail chili cheese fries which was unreal!  My husband had a Angus burger which he will talk about in his own review.  There are many other menu items that i'd like to try.  Going back there again the next time I visit Las Vegas.",

It is soo incredibly good, I wish I got more then just a bite of it, I might order it next time I go...  The Kiki- It was also really good, I would order it again.  The Lonely Bird- This one was just \"eh\" to me, compared to the other burgers. I probably wont ever order it for myself, but recommend it to those who enjoy turker/chicken burgers...  That's Cheesy- This was REALLY good, for a grilled cheese. I'm not quite sure I'd order it again though.  The bachi pickles were also really interesting, I ordered some and no one at the table really liked them. I gave them all a try and thought they were some interesting flavors and textures...it was worth the try, but wouldn't try it again.  the FRIES: Truffle parm: YES, Yes, YES. So good, I almost ordered another order...but we really didn't need anymore food.  The garlic salt and pepper: these were also nummy! But I suggest the truffle parm over them!  When we were done eating I ordered the Pop tart, but they didn't have any...so I ordered macadamia nut toffee cake...it wasn't bad...but I wasn't impressed with it. We also ordered a strawberry smoothie, which I felt tasted a little off.  Go and Enjoy it! It was awesome!!",

    "text": "First off, it was a little bit hard to find going west on Windmill. The parking and door is around behind Subway. I think there was another door on the Windmill side it looked like.  I met a couple of my friends here for lunch at around 12. It was not that busy when we got there, but 30 mins later bigger parties starting arriving and seemed to get busy.  I got the kalbi burger which was topped with kim chee and a kochujung mayo. SO FREAKING GOOD! It came with a side of cucumber kimchee as well. Surprisingly, I would have liked it to be a tad bit more spicy, but the flavors were all there.   I got a side of the truffle parmesan fries as well, and those were very very delicious. I haven't tried anything with truffles before but heard its awesome. And.. IT WAS.   My friend got the ronin buger, and he said he didn't care for it too much. He didn't really like the pickled slaw. My other friend got the peking duck steamed buns, which looked awesome! We both thought it was weird that it had boiled egg in it. But she said it was really tasty, but could've used less of the cilantro. The next time, I will get that, and I love cilantro so hopefully they pile it on.  I got my boyfriend the bahn mi burger to-go since he was at work. So, we shall see if he likes it.. Then we can return, so he can get the full dining experience.  I have to say.. service kind of sucks here. Or at least when I was there. We never got our waters filled until we had to ask. Expect to wait 15-20 mins for the food.. but worth it for the food. We waited for a good 15 mins with an empty table and to-go bags, and ended up going up to the cashier to try to get our checks, where they said they'd be with us shortly. We had to wait another 10 mins before we got our check. With our waiter passing us, he didn't take our check with payment, so I ended going back to the cashier to pay. I saw another table try at least 3 times to get their waiter's (same guy) attention for something. The woman finally went up to guy to let him know they needed something.  Overall, service was definitely lacking.. but the food most definitely NOT. Will be back again to try that peking duck!",

    "text": "My hub and I have had this place on our list for over a year, came once before but wait was ridiculous, so we went next door to Shoku Ramen and we loved it. Anyway, we came back tonight, place is packed, hostess guy said 35 minutes so we said cool, but can we just eat at the bar? No! We don't serve food there, and mind you it has about 12 seats and no one was sitting there. Well, ok , then we will have a drink there and wait. So we have to order a drink over this stupid glass wall, and who knows why, something about a sushi bar, blah blah blah, makes no sense, especially since we work with the health department on restaurants opening and have never ever heard of this dumb partition, anyway, what a total waste of space for a place this busy, they could have turned tables like crazy if they would just serve some dang food at this bar!?!?  So after about 2 drinks each and forty minutes later and no one leaving their tables, we pay our bar tab and are about to leave but the hostess man says, our table is ready! Ok what the hell, let's just stay and see what the hype is about.....waitress comes over and I say quickly he will have the black & blue burger, and I'll have Mr. Ho's, and the truffle fries. Food comes about 20 min later, and the truffle fries are ok, some brown goop on about 5 fries, no truffle flavor, and they look like McDonalds fries but not nearly as good...then we get our burgers. My burger was on a purple bun, and I thought it was blueberry so I ask the waitress, she says it's taro, ok so what's that, and she says some thing called taro, it grows out of the ground, mmm whatever. It is a good burger, interesting to say the least, cooked perfectly, hubby said his burger was great but he won't be back due to the wait. I say fix the bar issue which is valuable wasted space, and suggest people sit on the patio which we didn't even know was an option.",

    "text": "So when you walk in to a new restaurant after the Yelp cycle has been kicked up and there are so many 5 star reviews from random people or even some friends you have this level of anticipation and expectation.  I alluded to this in a previous review. Its probably not warranted but, its unavoidable! So I went with a few friends to Bachi Burger, giddy as a school..... boy.  Bachi is oddly located in a strip mall so I missed it on the first pass and unfortunately for them they have an entry door on either end of the place so I imagine it can be hard tracking the new arrivals.  The venue itself is a small sit down type place that is clean, modern, and simple.  The 2 flat screens on the wall had news and foodtv running for some entertainment variety.  Our server came up quick after being seated and drink were served right away. The menu (if the name didnt give it away already) is asian inspired and has several options for food and drinks (yay boba tea). I ordered the Kiki burger and the truffled parmesan fries.  The first thing you taste on the burger is the bun and oh boy was it tasty!  Its an asian style sweet bun and it is awesome. The meat was very fresh and all the ingredients had a good harmony together and everything tasted great. The fries I expected to have more of a truffle flavor but, fell just a little short.  The only thing that kinda bugged me was our server kept trying to take plates that had a little food left on it. Now here is the kicker I would highly recommend this place to anyone here in town but, it only got a 4 star review from me.  Why? Because 5 stars is perfection. And this place fell just short on the flavor profiles. Everyone at the table agreed it was a great burger at a great price but, we just weren't blown away. I will be coming back shortly and ordering a few other things and will update this review then!",

I highly recommend avoiding the steamed ones, as they are extremely small - nothing but a bun with meat, nothing else, and not a lot of either. Absolutely not worth the price for them. (2 tiny things for $8.50 or more depending on meat).  Everything else was great, including the truffle parmesan fries and garlic salt & pepper fries.",

Although all their burgers are awesomely crafted and unique in their own respective category, my personal favorites to my taste would have to be both the Miyagi-Sans burger and the Black & Green burger.  The Miyagi-san is a grass fed wagyu burger with furikake, onion rings, caramelized bacon, fried egg and chili mayo. The flavors aren't overdone and easily craveable. As for the Black & Green, it's a grass fed waygu as well, with mushrooms, spinach, point reyes blue cheese (Medium/full flavored), roasted garlic and bacon. Very deep and rich without being too strong and overpowering. If you are a fan of blue cheese this burger does your fandom some righteous justice. Bonus is that their buns are fresh, sweet and made local! Mmm, respect.  For fries, I go for the Truffle Parmesan and if I have a partner to share with, the oxtail chili fries is the perfect plate with plenty to go around. for dessert, I have only had the chance to try their donuts. Covered in some quality cinnamon sugar and matched with a perfectly complimenting mocha ice cream. Although, tends to be a bit doughy and undercooked as I have come to find.  Service is service, nothing really outstanding or outlandish, but prompt and knowledgeable about their food. All in all I appreciate this place because the attention to quality and detail, and in that respect they put out some amazingly delicious and unique food.",

The drinks are always interesting and delicious, it's never the standard fare here. I really appreciate that, because who wants to pay for a meal that they can make at home? I can make a cheeseburger, however an Angus Beef burger patty with Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, and Yuzu Citrus Aioli is not as easily done. So the Ronin is a delicious meal that I highly recommend. I always leave Bachi Burger full and happy.",

Now all the cons - We had to wait literally an hr and a half for our food to come out and arrive when there were hardly any ppl dining inside. That was as long and if not longer than our wait for the oyster bar. And maybe if the food was good then I'd cut them some slack, but even then the wait was unreasonable and inexcusable. The food definitely did not live up to the hype that my friend had said. He said it tasted much better than the Pasadena location which I think closed down, but i thought it was even worse. That same friend I went with also said he heard what appears to be the manager yelling at one of his servers. Yes, the service wasn't good (and he wasn't even yelling at our waitress). But that was totally rude, unnecessary, unprofessional, and uncalled for to yell at a worker in front of guests and customers. By the way, my friend also kindly asked if we could get comped some fries while we wait or in lieu of having to wait and a worker said she would ask our server but no one ever got back to us. Never going back again especially when there 1001 options to eat in Vegas!",

    "text": "Oh Bachi, how I've longed to come visit you.   After a long wait, my family and I gorged on a wide selection of their menu.   We ordered the pickled vegetables, oxtail fries, Spicy Miso Burger, Kiki's Burger and Kalbi's burger.  Despite many raving reviews, I personally did not care for the Oxtail Fries. It was like chili over a bed of fries .. and the oxtail did not add much flavor, even the egg yolk (which was very minimal) did not wow me. I expected a lot more punch but it just tasted like chili over fries. If you didn't tell me there were oxtail in it, I wouldn't have known. For nearly $11, I was super disappointed.   Out of all the burgers we tried, I LOVED the Spicy Miso Burger. It was so good, mouth-watering as I reminisce the burger. Delicious combination with the egg in it this time, and a wonderful flavor with the spiciness and miso-sauce. The burger was cooked to perfection at medium, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.   I would rank Spicy Miso, Kalbi (the Kim Chee was alright. nothing too spectacular since I've had much better Kim Chee but there was a lot of flavor in every bite) and then the Kiki's   We randomly tried the pickled vegetables (see picture attached) and it wasn't anything special. It was good though, just very dainty.   The reason for the 3 stars as opposed to 4 is because I've had a lot of these different wacky speciality burgers and I only thought the Spicy Miso burger was worth the price. The food didn't wow me to the point where I would necessarily come here again because there's just SO MUCH more places to visit in Vegas!",

I don't remember what exactly we ordered, but judging from our most recent visit EVERYTHING IS good. Our first visit it was pretty packed, second visit not as much, but when we sat down several more tables started showing up. Our first visit we had great service, this second time not as good unfortunately. It wasn't as bad but our waitress wasn't very attentive but there may have been a possibility she was waiting a couple of tables as well as bar tending. On to the food, we shared the chili garlic wings, oh my gosh. Honestly, we both could have gotten our own order of wings and been very very happy, we shared and were still quite happy. I got the burger with Kimchi and subbed for a wagyu burger, it was delicious! We also shared an order of fries which were pretty good as well. I love that you can add an egg to any burger, that just puts it over the top. Whatever you get here you'll enjoy, love this place. (Yelp LA Challenge #14 of 100)",

Strike one was that my mom mentioned to the server that we don't eat pork meat (but we can tolerate pepperoni in small doses) but still brought our appetizer with pork mixed in. She said that it stated it had pork sausage but it's not like my family had any idea what the heck the name of that sausage meant it was a pork sausage but whatever.  When our food came our burgers were dry and kinda overcooked. Both my dad and I asked for medium rare so it's a shame seeing wagyu getting cremated that way. It was still edible and besides it wasn't cheap so I wasn't gonna waste it (plus the hangry-ness needed to chill out).  If I gotta say something positive their momowhatever peach strawberry soda is really good.  Anyways, long story short if you want a good burger worth the money there is other cows in the sea... or something like that.",

I m so confused what happened to the Spicy Miso burger. I have had it a couple of times at the Summerlin location and loved it! This time the burger was smothered in a red sauce that tasted very similar to the sauce on the Kalbi burger. My friend got the Kalbi burger and although I love spicy, kimchi, and kalbi, that burger just did not have a good flavor. The sauce was something like a Sriracha sauce but overpowered the entire burger.   Also, I have tried the Truffle fries here and don't like the taste. The salt and pepper fries have a strong pepper taste and among 4 people we did not even finish 1/3 of the fries. The sweet potato fries are the best among the fries choices but the dipping sauce it comes with is gross. Way too sweet and strong of a taste, not complimenting it at all.   I don't know if it was an off night or the chefs are just not as good or ingredients used were different. I really don't know why the experience was so different from the Summerlin one. We are big Bachi Burger fans and tell people we meet everywhere to try it and it's too bad this was a bad experience for the high price.",

The wait is kinda long as there aren't that many tables inside but since the weather was nice, it wasn't a problem. I'm not sure how I would feel about the wait if I was hungover and standing outside in the summer vegas heat though lol  Since I had peking duck buns at the Wynn buffet the night before, we opted for the pork belly buns instead and they were delicious. The oxtail fries were quite good, not standout-ish but a nice change of pace as far as fries are concerned. The Miyagi wagyu burger was tasty, and maybe a little messy but the strong flavors were there. The egg was nice but I prefer smaller pieces of bacon. I definitely recommend sharing a burger though with someone (especially if you're planning to order other things) because the fries are a huge portion and the burger is also big enough to be shared.   Definitely worth taking friends that have never been before.",

Their burgers are not your ordinary burgers you find at some plain old American place....no, they add some Asian essence into each of their food items!  From the Miyagi burger topped with a fried egg and furikake to a kimchee kalbi burger that is to die for!    Not only are the burgers BOMB, but their appetizers satisfies each and every one of those taste buds on your tongue.  A few of my favorites include the oxtail fries (which is a MUST order), the arabiki and kurabuta sausages, and even the duck skin and pork belly buns!    I was born and raised in Hawaii, and us Hawaii peeps know that food in Hawaii is the best!  Living on the mainland sure makes you crave things you can only get back on the islands. Bachi burger is the perfect place to fix some of those cravings!     I cannot wait to go back and try a new burger!",

Lots of flavor in the chili, and a great dipping sauce for the truffle fries. The calamari was delicious!!! Came with 2 dipping sauces, 1 of which was a super interesting basil sauce (YUMMY). I always get the tan-tan ramen, which is a red seafood pork broth, very tasty and always recommended!!  The downside to this place is the service. The waiters and waitresses are usually always nice, but not the best quality. We always have to ask for refills on the water, generally have to wait a long time to be greeted after being seated, and always have to get up to make our payments because they take forever to come to the table.  Also, it's a little pricey. Plan to drop $15-20 per person. The iced tea was $4 each with no refills, oxtail fries $11, and ramen $9-$11 each bowl.  I like this place but pass a lot because of the prices and the service.",

Fantastic. For the main course was miyagi burger and kalbi burger, on point like island flavor Alan wong's American fusion. A must try at least once in LV...",

The doorway and another 20 to have 3 groups in front of us seated when servers, bartenders etc are having drinks behind the bar. Another time we waited almost 45 minutes for a seat by was acknowledged and kept informed. I guess it just depends on the day.   Overall, if you are willing to wait for service or lack thereof the food makes it more than worth it. They could step it up though.  Recommend: based on food alone yes. Good luck with anything else.",

Let's just say it was not a pleasant experience. The service left a lot to be desired. Our waiter was SUPER slow, came back to our table multiple times telling us things we were ordering were out (mini corndogs, crab artichoke dip, bison for the bison burger, to name a few). He took at least 20 minutes to bring our drinks, recommended an appetizer, but when asked questions about it, he couldn't answer. We could see him reading the bartenders book to mix a drink that was ordered, and it left a lot to be desired. The food was decent, not as good as we remembered, but not bad, which is the only reason for the 3. The service was the worst part of our visit. I do not plan to visit again.",

    "text": "Whenever I go somewhere new, I look up DDD's in the area to try.  Bachi Burger came up, and even though I don't remember seeing them on the show, I wanted to try it.    It's a little confusing because there are more than one locations in the area. I went to this one, which I think(?) is the one that was on the show.  The location is in a nondescript strip mall.   I got the pork belly steamed bun appetizer and the bahn-mi burger.  The port belly buns were good.  Pro tip: be careful if you bite in to the bun, the strip of fat at the back of the pork will all come out as one chunk that you can't bite through.  Consider cutting it with a knife or eating the whole thing in one big bite.  It comes with a hoisin type sauce which is quite good.   When I ordered the bahn mi burger, the waiter asked me if Medium was OK.  I asked for medium-rare at which point he warned me that the burger contains pork and shrimp, but they will make it medium rare if you want, so I did. The burger was very good.  Portions appear small here but are quite filling.  It comes with fries which are also very good.  Nothing knocked my socks off, hence the 4 star rating instead of 5.  I think this place has the potential to be 5-star (perhaps I caught them on an off-day).  I would come back and try more entrees in the future if I come back to the Las Vegas area.  My waiter was young but was on the ball and on top of things.  The waitstaff refilled my drinks competently.  There is a parking lot in the strip mall so no issues with parking.  Pro tip: if you see Bachi from the road, you will be tempted to park on the wrong site.  The entrance is on the inner-side of the parking lot.  I parked and walked in but was on the wrong side of the restaurant and had to walk through it to get to the greeter station.",

We started with the ox tail fries.... delicious!  I was surprised at how sweet the meat was, but the spicy from the peppers and onions was a great counter to the sweetness... I had the miyagi-san burger, and it was maybe one of the best burgers i have ever had!!!!  My boyfriend ordered the spicy miso burger, that too was pretty great!  I will def. be coming back!",

At first we thought it was just a one off, but now we gave it 2 chances and are extremely disappointed. The last time we went the woman chef in the back was yelling and scolding her staff and wait staff so loud it became uncomfortable for the entire restaurant.  This time, I took my co-workers on a lunch break and it took us 15 minutes after being seated just to get greeted, get a drink order and put in our food order. Then it took 15 minutes to get our drinks and 40 minutes for 2 burgers! Not once did our server Rachel acknowledge us or sincerely apologize for the wait. Working in the service industry, we tried to be understanding in the beginning, knowing she had multiple tables. But after we ordered, we were her only table! How does a water and a Coke take more than 15 minutes? Rachel avoided eye contact when we tried to get her attention. We had to ask the woman cleaning about the status of our food. We loved their burgers but it's definitely not worth waiting over an hour for a consistently crappy experience.",

We have nothing like it in Jacksonville and the dishes are so unique and flavored so well that you ask yourself \"why didn't I think of that?!?\"   This go around, me and my buddy had the oxtail chili cheese fries, pork buns, Kiki burger, ronin burger and the Parmesan truffle fries.   The oxtail chili cheese fries were really good. The oxtail was so tender like pulled beef and made the chili so much better than just regular ground beef chili.   The pork buns were great! The pork belly was braised really well and the pickle and eggs together in the bun made the perfect combo. The side sauce (homemade hoisin?) was the kicker that sent it over the top.   The burgers are sooooo good here and so original. It's hard to describe the intense Asian flavors and the combinations that each burger has. All I can say is that you must try for yourself. Every burger I've had here has that perfect balance to create a tsunami of umami. Sweet, salty and savory mixed with sour pickled... And that potato bun... two perfect pillows holding everything together.   The Parmesan truffle fries are everything you expect. Shoestring fries topped with Parmesan cheese with a hint of truffle and topped with a porcini sauce. Really good side dish for the burgers.   Service was impeccable and the cleanliness was comforting. Always a great experience and will always come back!",

The appetizers came out lightning quick and we ate them up as we were super hungry.  As for the burgers.... they were no where to be seen. We waited and ordered drinks to pass some time and the waitress assured us our order was next. But as orders came flying out the kitchen, none of them was ours. We saw people who came after us getting their burgers and new sets of customers who were barely there for 15 mins to get their food. Our order should have been priority but they decided to put our order behind the orders of newer customers. Our waitress began to ignore us knowingly they jacked up order.  It took us well over an hour for us to finally get our food and when we finally got our food the waitress basically threw the burgers at us and tried to avoid eye contact with us. They ended up comping us a round of drinks but that doesn't make up for the time lost and the poor service.",

Visit #1: Walked in an waited 10 minutes for the hostess to acknowledge that we were waiting for her. She was at a table speaking with other guests and looked up at us at least 4 times prior to coming over, and all the while acting as though we were inconveniencing her. We gave our name and was told it would be a 20 minute wait. She promptly went back to the same table to ham it up with the customers. 45 minutes later, we walked out, amazed that a simple, accurate wait time could not be provided.   Visit #2: Provided our name to the hostess and was told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. It was busy, so we were asked to please wait outside (mind you, it is summertime in Vegas). At 20 minutes I went back in asking how long it would be. The hostess advised another 5 minutes. 15 minutes later, my daughter PASSED OUT OUTSIDE because she was too hot and because we couldn't wait inside. Obviously we left immediately after that episode.  My opinion? This place is not worth the wait, or the irresponsible manner in which they give their wait times. The service is severely lacking. I won't be back, and the sad thing is, I can't even comment on the food!!!",

The service was spotty as we visited during lunch.  After our starters, the food began to settle in and the mile high burgers finally came out.  At this point, I was stuffed, but had to put down this spicy miso burger.  It's not the cheapest place for a lunch, but it's so worth it.  Oxtail chili cheese fries: By far one of the best dishes I've ever consumed.  The shredded oxtail was so tender, the flavor of the chili has a sweetness to it and it goes so well with the salty fries. The sunny side up egg just makes it even better.  Truly amazing, it's a must get and you'll be disappointed if you don't.  Pork Belly Buns: Not all that but still good.  I really enjoyed the bao dunked in their hoisin mixture and the touch of cilantro and radish gives it a great fresh touch.  Spicy miso burger: This this had to be at least 6\" high, piled with toppings and goodness. What makes their burgers so unique is the Taiwanese sweet bun, soft, fluffy, and chewy, what a burger bun should be. There are so many great flavors in this piece, it was delicious, from garlic to peppers, onions, and a fried egg. The patty was cooked perfectly, medium.  If you're in Vegas, this place is a must.  Make a trip here, it's worth the short drive off of the strip.  As we left lunch, the place was packed and had a line outside the door.  I recommend going early.  It's a nice place with friendly staff.",

(only applicable if you've tried it i guess)   ...ok read this: ASIAN FUSION BURGERS!!! i.e. the Ronin Burger consists of Carameled onions, Japanese cole slaw, Miso Dressing, a a friggen fried egg!!! (yes its ok to drool) I love anything with a fried egg on top! Which brings me to their Oxtail chili cheese fries, yes fried egg topper! Ridiculous! I love their bao sandwiches also! Steamed buns stuffed with BBQ pork belly inside!   I haven't had anything here that i don't like, and i hope it stays that way! I'll keep coming back till i have everything on their menu! Thats a promise! Cheeee!!!",

    "text": "My wife and I are new to Vegas and love a good burger.  We live close to this location and had been excited about trying this restaurant.  We have 2 children under 3 so one day when they were napping I ran over to get 2 burgers to-go.  I placed my order and after 15 minutes of waiting I started to wonder how long it would take.  At 20 minutes I started getting a little annoyed.  After 25 minutes I was standing in front of the counter clearly a little ticked and nobody said anything to me.  I finally received my take-out and the general manager handed me the bag and didn't even say anything.  I looked at the receipt and it took 27 minutes!  I have worked at high and low end restaurants and NOTHING takes that long, not even a well-done steak.  All we ordered was a regular burger done medium and veggie burger.  Any manager with minimal customer service skills should have realized at 15 minutes it was taking too long and he was up there looking at the order tickets the whole time.  In addition, my wife said her burger was undercooked of all things and mine was average at best.    I was so disappointed that I wrote them an email on their website and they didn't even bother to respond.  Perhaps their food is better if you eat in but I have such a bad taste in my mouth for this business and how they run things, especially not having enough class to write me back, that I fear that will never happen.  So very disappointed.",

I have twice dined here after 8pm.  In comparison with the lunch crew, here are the differences:  1)  Service is still good, but it's not as quick as the fully staffed lunch crew. 2)  The food tends to be more salty during the evenings.  I'm not sure if this is their intention for you to purchase more beer or a matter of preference by the kitchen.  Compare the ramen and definitely the oxtail fries.",

No one, including our waiter, bother to check up on us, informed us of any delays in the kitchen, or refill our water. It was as if the staff was too ashame to face us.  All it takes to turn this experience around was to check in with us and keep us posted that our meal is taking a little bit longer to prepare.  Maybe we would have like an appetizer in the meantime.  It took me 5 mins to finally flag down a person to ask about our order.  She did not even bother to ask what our orders were. Then it took her another 10 minutes to come back and let us know what our order is coming....which actually took 5 mins to come. Once our food did come out, we had 3 people check on us within 10 minutes. One lady, who I assume was the manager,  even came by to give an empty apology for the long wait. She did not bother to look at our table. I am extremely upset and disappointed.  I used to recommend this place to everyone that comes into Vegas but that will no longer be the case going forward. I highly doubt I will return. Thank you to our server for your employee discount but what we needed was a sincere apology and much better service.",

We couldn't finish it because it's just so much food along with the burgers but we did not regret ordering all that we did. The fries  started getting a little soggy so I wouldn't want to take it back to my hotel.   Service was just okay and the night wasn't very busy.

Having choices of Wagyu beef for my burger was something I haven't seen since Mastros in Beverly Hills.  I'm starting to notice a trend of people using this more often than Kobe Beef.  I had the Miyagi-san burger.  The buns are soft and buttery, the tempura onions were amazing and the egg adds to the flavor presentation.  Side order of Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries and my vice... Thai Tea.  I like that they offer the option of adding a patty to their burgers.  While it would be impossible to fit it in your mouth with the leaning tower of ingredients found on this burger, I'm sure that for someone like me who is a protein hog would take advantage of it.",

Yes they're is a list of specialty burgers you can get, and obviously people love them.  (ie the Ronin, Kiki, Banh Mi, etc.)  but I seriously recommend you build your own burger.  I feel like a lot of the ingredients take away from the greatness of the beef in the burger.  Sometimes simpler is better, less is more.  Go with the Kobe, so good.

    "text": "[edit-- after subsequent trips back to this place and realizing that the cravings for bachi burger are never ending, I have bumped the rating from a 4 up to a 5. This place is one of a kind.]  This is not your typical burger. If you are craving a cut and dry, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles on a salted angus patty with a slice of American cheese, go elsewhere. If you are a little more open minded and crave the satisfying structure of a burger with a new and unique spin, come on down to Bachi burger.  The wait wasn't too long for the two of us. My girlfriend ordered the Kiki burger and I the Kalbi burger. We shared some parmesean truffle fries which were ultra tasty and came with a sun dried tomato aioli sauce that was perhaps one of the finest sauces I have ever tasted. They were cut thin like average fries but far from average in taste and quality. The burgers themselves arrived 15-20 minutes after ordering and were cooked medium rare as requested. The kiki burger featured sweet caramelized onions and three different kinds of asian mushrooms. My Kalbi burger came with a sweet korean bbq marinade, green onions and enough kimchi to give it a noticeable kick. It was blissful. The meat was juicy and plentiful, the marinade was not excessive or overpowering (although it did drip all over my hands and face) and the balance of the sweet with the spicy kimchi simply turned out to be a winning combination. I'm a man with a respectable appetite and upon finishing the burger and fries was thoroughly stuffed. I had the green tea to drink on the side.  We didn't try deserts or appetizers but we'll definitely be making a trip back here to see what other goodies this place has to offer. The bottom line is that Bachi burger offers a unique, Asian spin on the classic American burger with delicious results. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable for a burger that is anything but fast food in quality. Burger fans and foodies alike-- you simply have to try it.",

We got the fries first and before our burgers even came out, the plate was half gone, which probably explains why I couldn't finish my burger.  The Husband opted for their famous Ronin burger while I got the Spicy Miso Burger. Comparing the two, we both favored the Spicy Miso a tad more.  The burgers were good, but took a little getting used to... for some reason asian fusion burgers tend to be on the sweet side, definitely reminded me of MOS burger in Taiwan or Bun Bun.  Would we come back?  Probably, there's still plenty of other burgers and sides to try... oh and let's not forget the fries!",

I would have liked to try the short rib one but they told me they took it off the menu.  The Banh mi burger was also very good.  I would love to give this place 5 starts bu the location is not great for people staying on the Strip--about $20 cab each way from Mandalay, which basically doubles the price of anything on the menu.  5starts is you have your own ride but not worth the cab ride.    Please open a location on the Strip!  Please!!",

These were probably the best burgers we had other than homemade in a very long time. The combination of spices, sweet fish sauce, mushrooms, on the Kiki burger were perfect.  I loved the sweet, zesty flavor. We shared the two burgers and the other was the Black and Green burger. This burger had a total earthy, warm delicious flavor. What The buns were steamed and grilled to perfection. The burgers were a good size but not so overwhelmed with toppings that they were messy or difficult to eat. I would highly recommend this stop and according to the table next to us the Portuguese doughnuts were delicious for dessert!",

I ordered the bachi pickles, they were okay but very little and the just fries. The just fries was good and plenty but they gave only a tiny bit of ketchup and when requesting more it cost .50 for more ketchup. The burger came about 15 minutes after we finish the fries. They were very big but didn't taste that great. I don't recomend going there. I must say I did love the decor though, very trendy, wish I could say that about the food and service.",

    "text": "Three stars is not for the fantastic burgers because they truly are great but the obtuse way in which we were treated when we put our names down to wait.  I'm going to be back as I've been here before but tonight I decided I wasn't welcome for whatever reason and dined elsewhere.  Bachi Burger became Snooty Burger as I was talking to a hostess trying to get my name on the long list, the other host (or gasp maybe he was a manager) asked me if I would like a menu and I said no thank you. And then he proceeded to lean his body in front of mine because he wanted to talk to her and perhaps thought I was flirting or something?  Not sure but I still hadn't got my name put down on the list in the midst of all this.  He shot me a dirty look and called her away to the middle of the restaurant, berated her on the floor for what I can only gather was some seating slight and then came back himself to ask me if needed something. To which I replied, yes, I needed to make sure I had my name on the list and to tell him that was all I was trying to do and proceeded to tell him how inexcusably rude his behavior was. What a putz.  I hope a great name like Bacchi Burger has secrete shoppers to let them know how their staff is acting when they aren't around.  But the Burgers, some of the best in town.  I guess I'll just eat at the other location they just opened instead.",

The 4 of us were all Bachi virgins and our cherries were about to get popped like goes the weasel!  All of us agreed to get a different burger each and a different specialty drink.  I ordered the Kalbi Burger which I thought was the biggity bomb!  It had kim-chee inside! It came with a side of Kim-chee style mini zucchini/cucumber, wasn't too sure what it was but it was tasty, and went well with my burger.  The drink i had was the strawberry lemonade jasmine tea (no free refills). It was really pulpy so if you order it, make sure you get a glass of water too to wash it all down.  And I can't forget the ox-tail chili cheese fries... Mmm! I just wish they put more ox-tail.  The overall experience at Bachi was a memorable one.  Service was fast, music was good, environment was comfortable, and the food was Uh-maze-zing!  I will definitely be back!",

I guess I just don't understand why these are considered good burgers, especially when there are plenty of other gigs in town. I've been here twice just to be sure my first assessment was correct and because I have a friend who adores this place, but doesn't get to go often because his partner hates it. My second visit was like the first: lackluster, disorganized surface, and ok burger, followed by a $40 check for lunch which didn't include any alcohol. Maybe it's my indifference toward trendy that lends to this opinion.",

I thought it was normal ohh new restaurant opening they need to find their grove and figure out timing etc. yeeaaahhhh no. It could still use tons of improvement. Not that the anyone is really rude or anything. But food takes forever, the lack of skill, lack of organization, no ever seems apologetic when your food comes out wrong or late, cause it happens sooo often. Normally food coming out wrong isn't an issue, but the last 5 times I've gone this year it has. Those are just the some of them. I'm not saying don't come here to eat. You should the food is good. All I'm saying is prepare to a wait a long time for stuff. To get someone to come to your table, or get your drink, or the food. When stuff comes out right or at a some what decent time you like totally think it's a Christmas miracle. If not for the less than mediocre arrive the place would have a 5.",

We were all able to be seated, but I don't know how long the rest of the group was waiting to be seated, and I'm not sure if they made prior arrangements or whatever. (I don't know that this is really the best place for large groups though...the restaurant isn't that big). With such a big group, I thought we would be there forever waiting for food and everything. Not so...the staff were very friendly and everything was a lot faster than I thought it would be. I was actually pretty impressed with the speed. The staff were very attentive, and they joked around with us. Also, not once were our water glasses empty, which I really appreciated.  Anyhow, the food (which is why anybody is reading this review anyhow)... Oxtail chili cheese fries...fantastic! If you've never had oxtail, the meat is really tender and juicy, so it definitely adds a new dimension to chili fries. They also put an egg on it. Also, it's huge so consider sharing it.  I ordered the black and green burger and it was delicious! You can definitely taste the quality meat in it. the combination of ingredients was quite superb. I guess it's a fancy burger, and for a burger it is pricey, but I think it's worth it, at least once in a while. Definitely something unique.  I was quite satisfied, and had a great experience. :)",

Went here twice and this is what I've tried: Truffle parmesan fries: ordered it both times :) the fries are your good standard size fries and was the perfect crispness but the aioli dipping sauce is what makes it! I keep the sauce and spread it on my burger too :p it'll make any burger amazing   Burgers I tried: Kiki burger Blue and green burger Kimchi burger (forgot the menu name but it had kimchi on it)  I would come again for the Kiki burger but the other two were solid as well. ( my fiance got the blue burger, and then the kimchi the other time). He enjoyed them both but I'm just not a big fan of kimchi in my burger nor blue cheese but they are solid. The best thing about this place is there meat to bun ratio... Sooo much meat... =)  I also had the iced jasmine tea with boba. I was lightly sweet with a hint of boba. I like jasmine tea so jasmine tea + boba = good stuff.  I have can sensitive sweet tooth from time to time so I actually had to add a little bit of water to make it less sweet, but it was still good!",

But I regularly get the pork belly steamed buns or the duck steamed buns with fresh shrimp chips along with at least two glasses of the Apple Yuzu soda, that stuff is addicting!  I've also tried the oxtail chili cheese fries. Sounds good on paper but the ratio of soggy chili fries to normal fries was out of proportion. Too much chili and not enough oxtail. You wanna get a soggy fry, normal fry, chili, cheese and a piece of oxtail in every bite and that just wasnt possible.   Desserts are forgettable, which is fine cuz I go there for the food.   Wednesdays are industry nights for locals, I think this is a recent thing so take advantage while you can.",

My BF and I sat down, ordered the chili/garlic edemame, he had the Mata green tea and I had the apple/lychee soda.  My soda was yummy! My BF wanted sweet n'low for his tea but they didn't have any.  So our waitress gave us sugar, which doesn't work cause it wont dissolve and sinks right to the bottom..oh well.  Anyways- our friends finally get in and I order the duck steamed buns, my BF orders the KIKI burger and our friends get the Blue/Green burger and the Crab burger.  We also order sweet potato fries, garlic salt pepper fries, Parmesan truffle fries and shrimp chips.   My duck steamed buns were delish- wish they would offer a combo of all the steamed buns in one dish, that way someone  like myself that likes variety can try all three since I love pork belly too!  My BF and friend that ordered the burgers both thoroughly enjoyed theirs, they said the burgers were nice and juicy and were cooked perfectly.  I had a small bite of my BF's Kiki burger and really liked it too (next time!) I also tried my friend's crab burger and it was okay- the crab cake had a good amount of crab, hardly any fillers so it was quite flaky.  Now- out of all the fries, I actually loved the sweet potato fries the best, the wasabi aioli had a nice kick to it but the sweet potato fries were a thicker cut so you can still get the warm/soft potato bite to it. The others were just okay and the shrimp chips a little too greasy still.  Overall, a success as we will definitely be back to try more on the menu!",

Since then, I've gone back a bunch of times and every time the food has been delicious (It makes me sad to see that some yelpers had bad experiences 'cause I just can't imagine it).  I've tried a variety of burgers and appetizers now. You really can't go wrong with anything you choose. The flavors are delectable, and it's all so unique. I would have to say my favorite burger is the Kalbi burger--I order it without kimchi though. Fabulous flavors from the meat to the sauce that they put on it. I've also had the Banh Mi Burger, the Ronin, and a couple more I can't recall right now. Again, I can't think of a single thing to complain about any of them.   Everyone should try the oxtail chili cheese fries, though. I know the name can be intimidating to some who aren't adventurous in their food experiences, but it is so delicious! The meat part reminds me of bbq pulled pork, but it has a kick to it that makes it a little spicy. On top of thinly cut fries and a fried egg, this app is amazing. The fries, whichever way you get them, are good. Thin cut, so there's a bit of crunch to them. The other appetizer I've had was the Bachi Pickles. From my understanding, it changes almost day to day because it just depends on what vegetables the chef felt like pickling the night before. It was very different and interesting. I liked most of them, but I wouldn't say it's the dish for everyone.  Almost every time I've gone, I've ordered the jasmine milk tea with boba to drink. It's so delicious. I wouldn't say the boba is amazing, but it's decent for a restaurant. I just love that milk tea. It's very floral, though, so I wouldn't recommend it to someone that doesn't like very flowery tasting tea.  Finally, the servers have always been really nice. The wait time has gone up since it's aired on Triple D, of course, but it's never really that bad. It's almost a coin flip. I've gone on a regular Monday night and the place was packed; probably a 30-40 minute wait to be seated if memory serves me correctly. Then I've also gone on a Tuesday night and barely anyone was there, so it just depends on how lucky you are I suppose.",

    "text": "Mixed feelings - for one, the staff were awesome and let our party of four in just 10 minutes before closing. Thank you for that - it's not always easy to find a place to cater to four different tastes!  LOVED the handmade sodas - cherry yuzu is insanely refreshing, could not get enough. Sides are so-so, the jalapeno slices in the salt and pepper fries are kind of awkward to eat. The chili chicken was amazing, according to a tablemate.   For the burgers, reactions ranged from \"incredible\" to \"okay\" to \"not for me.\" I feel like some of the burgers have a bit too much of everything going on. I love the idea of a taro bun, but in reality, maybe not needed on a burger with five other flavors. I got the kalbi burger and was in heaven. It's a messy joint, but totally delicious. Probably the most satisfied diner at our table.   In retrospect, perhaps not that high on my list of places to return to, but it was there when we needed it. If you are an adventurous eater with a taste for Japanese flavors, you will likely love it, but if you are just a burger and fries kind of person, you may want to stay away or just keep it simple.",

Be prepared to wait as this place is gaining in popularity with new hours and a steady clientele. We were there for lunch this week and waited close to 30 minutes for our food to finally come out. Bachi also likes to charge for every little thing...$1.00 for extra sauce, $1.50 for cheese (1 slice) on your burger and $1.75 for one onion ring to add to your burger... really I don't think Sysco Foods your supplier charges that much for cheese & onions to justify that charge. Delicious mouthwatering  burgers but getting nickeled and dimed for everything is a bit hard to swallow. Staff could also be given more authority to make customers happy instead of always having to defer to management for approval. Love ya Bachi but please be more reasonable with your pricing.",

    "text": "EDIT: The manager of Bachi Burger contacted me with his concerns, and since I've had both HORRIBLE experiences with backlash for negative reviews, and decent ones, I MUST add this to my review: ***Because of how professionally it was handled and how polite the message was, if I was back in this area, I would likely give this place another try and just order different things. Management with excellent customer service skills? Good job.  Wow... I can't express the disappointment that myself and my friends experienced at this place. It should also be stated that I KNEW I was walking into a fusion restaurant, and I was expecting a different take on burgers - but I wasn't expecting a sugar rush or an upset too-much-sweets stomach from a burger for lunch.  We arrived for lunch, having driven quite a ways away from the strip (which is FINE if you want to drive; we didn't mind at the time. But if you're looking for a good burger and you're visiting Las Vegas, staying on the strip? Just eat somewhere down there, really), and we were starving. This place busy, but not full; having said that, it took quite a bit of time to get seated in comparison to other restaurants that were just as busy during our trip, and yet seated us sooner. When we were seated, it then took quite a while for someone to pay attention to us long enough to take our order - they seemed very impatient and annoyed with questions about the menu, or any of the three of us being indecisive. They were very much non-engaging, as well, if that makes sense - it didn't feel as though they gave a hoot whatsoever that we were there, spending our money at their business.  The items that we all settled on: Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns - These were the only thing I really liked about the meal. They were a new, interesting version of steamed buns; since I'm in LOVE with steamed buns and any form of dim sum, I liked the different take on this dish.  Spicy Miso Burger  Black and Green Burger  Kiki's Burger - this is what I ordered. I can honestly say that, along with the other people at my table, all I remember was how OVER POWERINGLY SWEET THIS THING WAS. Seriously. Sure, it was juicy and tender meat, but you couldn't even taste the meat itself because it was drenched in whatever marinade/sauce they use. For being told this was THE place to go for excellent burgers, I must say... not so excellent, unless you want a sugar high and have no interest in the burger itself. HOWEVER, the burger buns were divine and fluffy. Very nice touch, but would have been a nicer touch on a burger worth eating. If their quality of meat is sooooo great and wonderful, then they shouldn't hose them down with so much sauce that they kill the flavor of such \"quality\" meat.  Truffle Parmesan Fries - these were so unimpressive. It tasted like they took powdered brown mushroom gravy out of a packet, is the comment my partner said. On top of that, the overly sweetened mush burgers were enough food to have just skipped the fries altogether.  Taro boba was bland, I've definitely had better for a lesser price; my partner remarked that the thai tea was kind of dull, too.  We had a few other things, but I don't recall EVERYTHING that was on our table... none of it was good enough to really remember, except for the neat steamed \"buns\" and how fluffy the burger buns were.  In the end, our incredibly disappointing experience came out to $70-ish, and it should have been under $50 for what we felt we got out of it. The whole place seemed pretentious and snooty, especially for a restaurant specializing in burgers. The attitude (or lack of one, since they hardly cared to pay attention to us) of the service, the ridiculous marinade/sauced burger patties, and the overall disappointment is NOT worth recommending this place to others - at least, not from my point of view.  To top it all off, we had reservations at a restaurant that night that we were all very excited for, but within 20 minutes of leaving, two out of three stomachs were so soured from the sugar burgers that we had to cancel our dinner plans, and actually just return to our hotel rooms for a nap!",

Fries: 8/10- I wish there were more oxtail meat in the fries- it was tender, soft, and super freaking delicious. But regardless, the fries are crispy and delicious! Definitely much more chili than fries needed- a good and perfect amount. Burger: 10/10- ahmigaweeddddddddddd how can I describe it- buttery, meaty, sweet, and oh so just AH DELICIOUS. I had only half the burger but I was pretty satisfied. I really can't just simply describe it- you HAVE to try it. It's deliciously amazing.

The entrees took a LONG time to come out!!! We didn't get our burgers till 5:00! All the while a couple sitting at a table next to the bar got their food and left before the burgers even came to the bar (Keep in mind said couple was seated 10-15 min AFTER us)! The server was profusely apologetic about the long wait but I chose to stay classy in the end despite the temptation to complain. For as long as they made us wait and how often they asked us if there was anything we can get, I would have appreciated a comp on desserts or drinks! People shouldn't have to shout/req to speak to manager/make a scene just to get noticed! After finishing the Portuguese donuts, I just wanted to get out of there! So much so I payed cash and told her to keep the $1 or $2 change! I would have liked to tip more because I truly enjoyed the free bird burger and our server's attentiveness, but that was a horrendous wait for the entrees! Yes I realize you had 3 or 4 groups over 5, but that doesn't excuse the fact that others received who came to sit after us (including a couple newly seated next to me at the bar towards the end of our burger noshing) received their entrees faster than we did!  I'm open to going back when there's absolutely nobody or if I place a takeout order in advance! Maybe then the wait will be less long.",

We love that they do something different, each item is very unique and creative. You wouldn't think that the flavors would mesh so well but man do they!  Here is my MUST try list:  Oxtail Chilli Cheese Fries Spicy Miso Burger Truffle Parmesan Fries Chili Fried Chicken Black & Green Burger Ginger Chili Edamame Strawberry Jasmine Lemonade  Even if you aren't a big fan of Asian fusion, its hard to deny a good burger and fries.",

Of these, the peking duck wrap was good but not as good as gourmet Chinese such as at Blossom - Aria Hotel, or my usual high end Vancouver BC Chinese restaurants. However, the burger was excellent and the oxtail chilli cheese fries were superb.",

    "text": "(First off, I am giving this place a 4 star rating because I can't give it 3.5 stars which is what it really deserves.)  Parking: The main entrance is in the rear and there is no handicapped parking close.  WiFi: WiFi was iffy for Windows users. I suspect that this is a MAC snob establishment and not an issue for MAC users.  Noise Level: There is no noise dampening in the whole place, hence you can hear everyone and everything. The noise made it difficult to converse, even over a two-top.  No Booths: While not having booths may be convenient for employees to put together for large groups it is not comfortable for others. Personally I prefer a booth. Having only tables presented a unique situation for me; I have a hat and cane. I have a hat because it covers my balding head and the cane because I like to walk, but where do you put them at a two-top? The unfortunate answer is you put them on the floor.  Decor: The wall decor was lacking. They claim to want to showcase works from local artists, but it would seem that $2000 photos were the focus. Too few to be interesting, but the ones they did have were really big (not very good, just big). Maybe it is better at night.  Going Green: Want to be green, use cloth napkins for both dining and the moist nap after the meal. Also, offering a hot, moist napkin after the meal would be very classy. Cloth napkins also add a touch of class.  Place Mats: The place mats are \"natural\" and have a texture. They are uncomfortable to put your arms on. But when the staff was clearing the table nearby, they just wiped then off. The staff did not clean the sauce that had spilled into the mat. The mats should have been replaced. I am left to wonder what was still in my mat.  Table Setup: Each table has a salt pot instead of a shaker. I am wondering where the wooden spoon has been... There is no black pepper on the table, but a service of a \"chili water\" (WAY hot), and what I was told was \"Japanese Pepper\" that seemed to be some sort of pepper powder (again, spicy). Also a ceramic holder of toothpicks was on the table. What on the menu would I need toothpicks at the table for?  Service: We were greeted multiple times within seconds of walking in and seated promptly. All service oriented portions of the experience were done in a timely manner. However we had to remind the waitress to serve our fries and we were asked 3 times if we wanted dessert, annoying.  Ordering: You order everything a la carte. When you order a \"Bachi Burger\" for $6.00 get you the burger, nothing else. You then order your sides all separately and they all come separately. This a la carte ordering seems to be a trend around town, I have seen it before and I am not a fan. When the order comes and there are all these separate plates and serving vessels and glasses the table gets crowed really easily. In the fries all come with some sort of dipping sauce, but with everything on the table it can be hard to get to some times. When you see a burger on a large white plate with nothing else, it looks rather sad. Sure it highlights the fabulous burger, but it also point out how small it is.  The Food: My wife and I both ordered the Bachi Burger, it was lunch and that is all we wanted. The 5 oz. Angus burger was cooked correctly to medium (although I ordered medium rare) and the bun and fixings were correctly assembled. The burger tasted great and did not fall apart (believe me when I tell you this is an issue in the world of burgers). My wife also ordered the Sweet Potato Fries which we would come back for again. I ordered the Garlic Salt and Pepper Fries that came with a curiously strong Aioli that I would have loved to put on my burger. We both ordered sodas that were great (again, my wife's pick of the Mandarin Orange was the winner.)  I would have loved to have had all this on one plate; it felt so hodge podge it made for a slightly uncomfortable eating experience. Honestly, it should be: Pick you burger, add a sauce, pick your fries and other sides and give it at one price based on the burger. Put it all on one plate and dress it well.   Other Thoughts: 5 ounces is not a 1/3 pound burger and most other places around doing good burgers are doing either 1/3 to  1/2 pound burgers, so again I felt a bit short changed. Surely adding an ounce would put you up to snuff. The potato fries are cut too thin. I am hoping you are using fresh fries and not frozen bagged fries just dressed up, but in any case the fries are nice and crunchy but there is not enough fluffy potato within. Your Sweet Potato Fries are thicker and better cut (Hmm... me thinks kicked up US Foods).  This is dining at a level that wants to be fine, but without that stodginess. I can get behind that but there needs to be a slight rethinking of the menu and very minor changes to the environment with the dining area. What is has left me with is \"Pricey Burger Place\" that I will go to again in a few months to see if they have fine tuned the experience.",

My favorite were the oxtail fries, so tender and delicious and such an interesting take on the old chili cheese fries. The burgers were okay for me; they were interesting combinations, but I am just not a burger person. It's pretty spacious and the food is good.",

    "text": "The atmosphere is ok. The service is good. Nice place to get together with friends and enjoy a beer & burger. The sweet potato fries are what keeps me coming. They are simple and amazing. I've been here several times and here's what I think of the sandwiches I got:  Wagyu Burger - Ok. Not amazing. A little too salty for my liking. If you have ever had L&L BBQ Beef... imagine that in-between 2 pieces of a sweet bun. I guess the salty-sweet thing kinda works. I won't get it again. 2 stars.  Ronin Burger - Better. There is a lot going on in this burger. The slaw and miso dressing were tasty. The Yuzu Citrus Aioli gave a little horseradish that killed some of the sweetness. That worked well. The egg got lost in everything going on in this burger, I didn't even taste it. 3-stars.  Bachi Fish - Good. I'm not a real fish person but this worked for me. It's simplicity is what was good for me. One of the best fish sandwiches I've ever had.   Kiki's Burger - Best. I've ordered this several occasions. If you're a mushroom lover... you'll love it. The marmalade mixed with the salty cheese is a flavor explosion. I highly suggest accompanying this burger with sweet potato fries.   The Truffle Parmesan Fries needs more of the Aioli on top of it. It's ok but not the best fries.   I'll be back. Not the worst but not the most memorable. I'll give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.",

    "text": "Bachi Burger is an absolute gem, offering tremendous value and tasty food in a very unassuming location.  When entering the restaurant from the parking lot, you probably won't be expecting much.  I know that I was expecting to see a basic burger menu and not much else.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The menu is best described as Hawaiian fusion comfort food, which made a lot more sense when I read that the chef came from Roy's.  In addition to standard burgers, the menu has some unique Asian burger twists as well as tasty options such as pork buns.  There's also a nice selection of fries, a huge boba menu and an eclectic selection of beers and sake.  I went with the most straightforward menu option to get a feel for what they could do with a basic burger.  I ordered the American Wagyu burger with cheddar cheese and bacon added.  The verdict: delicious and incredibly well crafted.  The bun was golden and perfectly soft, and the burger itself was certainly high quality and savory.  The fries added to the enjoyment, especially the truffle fries with a magnificent aioli for dipping.  Oh, and I haven't even gotten to the best part... the value.  The Wagyu burger comes in at an almost unbelievable $7.  Add cheese and bacon and now you're talking $9.  Truffle fries come in at $3.50.  These prices fall in line with restaurants like Applebee's, and the quality difference can be measured in miles.  I didn't get to indulge in any of the desserts (which sounded like they should be on the menu at a Michelin starred restaurant) but they're all $5.  This could be the best value in the entire city.  I've seen several reviewers here bring up Burger Bar, and I respectfully disagree with those that say the Bachi Burger is superior.  However, my favorite customized Buffalo burger at Burger Bar is over twice as much money but not twice the quality or taste.  And the convenience of the location makes it that much more attractive.  Bachi Burger deserves to be a huge hit, and I highly recommend that locals check it out once.  Your taste buds and your wallet will be thankful.",

I had the Miyagi-San burger ($14), which had fried egg, fried onions, bacon, and an interesting sauce. The buns were very fresh and collapsed easy.  One thing I wasn't a huge fan of were the oxtail chili cheese fries ($12). They tasted like generic chili cheese fries and the fried egg was a tad overcooked, resulting in less yolk. Further, you could not really taste any of the oxtail.  The Parmesan truffle fries were solid. The sauce that accompanied them was delicious.  I am rating Bachi Burger 5 stars due to how unique the burgers are and the overall quality. Expect to pay about $25 for a share of appetizer and a burger. Everything is ala cart as well, so be sure to take that into account.   Great food, nice service. I would go back here.",

Bachi Burger is in a shopping complex with several other businesses, and lots of parking.  FOOD I was interested in the ramen since I've never seen a burger place sell ramen, and the two tables around us had ordered ramen.  Like literally, the table of 2 next to us both people had ordered ramen, and the table on the other side of us with 4 people they all ordered ramen.  There must be something up with the ramen and I will definitely try it next time.  -Truffle Parmesan Fries: My bf and I are suckers for any kind of truffle fries, and it was sooo good at Bachi.  I ordered it and it came with some kind of brown sauce (was that the truffle??) on top.  I also had mine Sweet potato - so good!  -Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries: My bf had this with his burger, I liked mine better but his was good too.  -Miyagi San burger: I had this, and requested it on salad since I have wheat allergies.  They gave me no problem and put it on a nice bed of veggies.  Yum!  I really liked the teri sauce, the furikake, bacon and fried egg on top of a juicy wagyu patty.  The onion rings I just ate on the side haha.  -Kalbi burger: Bf had this, said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had.  And he's a burger guy so I take his word on it lol.",

I think the concentration of combining two restaurants into one, along with hiring trendy people with fully tattooed arms,  men that have ponytails and handlebar mustaches has definitely gone to this pathetic crews head of what service really is. With a total of four tables being served I waited 10 minutes to see by a girl who \"was heading outside anyway\". To sitting at a table where I have to get my own napkins this was about as pathetic as one could get.   Now on to the food... wanting something light I have always been a fan of brussel sprouts and fried rice. If you cannot execute the food do not serve the damn food! Burnt to a crisp this brussel sprouts were absolutely atrocious. The fried rice was so laden in fat as well as lacking of  fundamental seasoning.  I know this restaurant pulled its claim to fame with unique flavor combinations and being on the Food Network. If it keeps on the path it's going it will be back on the Food Network only with Robert Irvine and Restaurant Impossible tried to save this disaster!",

    "text": "Came here by searching Yelp. Poured over the reviews and decided that this place was going to be my cheat meal. So the next day we drove over to some strip mall.  My boyfriend and I sat down. Nice big place. Lots of tables, photos of Japan, kinda dark for ambiance.   For starters we ordered the pork belly buns and a couple of beers. I think one reserve is if a place is going to be semi-gastropub with classy burgers and some microbrews, then THE WAITER SHOULD BE ABLE TO EDUCATE US ABOUT THE BEER. I asked him how the honey wheat was and he said it was from some company and I said, \"But yeah, how does it taste\" and luckily my boyfriend had compared it to another beer. The waiter clearly stammered, but I'm a dick because he and I are brewers and we just wanted to see what his view was.  Anyway, the steamed buns came. There was pork belly, a bit of cilantro and scallion, a small slice or radish and quail egg. I loved it! If I can't go to Momofuku, I'll settle for this. Honestly, the egg was totally insignificant and I could have done without it. It's already rich from the pork belly. The belly was was tasty. Very tender and melted in my mouth!  After I ordered the Kiki's Burger with Truffle Parmesan Fries. On man, enoki mushrooms, Gruyere, onion jam, and bacon? I loved how nothing overpowered anything and I can taste all of its components.  The Truffle fries were so decadent as well and I loved how you got the whole cone. There are some places that will crumple a ball of paper up so the fries get a lift making it more plentiful. Honestly, I couldn't finish it, but damnit I tried.  Next time I go to Vegas for rock climbing or whatever, I'm so coming back. I wish this place existed in California.",

    "text": "I live in Henderson, so this review is from a local.  I looked up what time they opened so I could be first in line for a take out for our lunch order. Looked up the distance and time so as to arrive around 15 minutes early. So I'm standing there and a bmw pulls up and sits right there in front of the entrance and of course leaves their engine on to run the a/c as it's around 100F out. The fumes started to bug me so when I saw one of the employees I knocked on the glass door and asked to sit inside (even though they weren't open yet) and he immediately let me in around 10 minutes early! One star.  I sat and people started coming in before anyone was seated, and I didn't feel like standing just to be first. When they started seating, the guy said ok, who's first (second star) and I stood, walked past the other people and said I'd like to make a take out order.  I just got two cheeseburgers and an order of fries. He asked me if I wanted L / T / O (lettuce, tomatoes, onions) and I said yes, how would you like them cooked? One well done, one medium. I forgot to tell them to burn my fries - I like them really crunchy. Oh well, next time.  The order took around 15 minutes or so (third star). The fourth and fifth star was for the first bite of my bachi burger. The bun is thin, so you don't have to unhinge your jaw to get a full bite. The burger is just tasty and juicy and I got l / t / o with every bite. Fries were good (crunchy next time!). For the fries, I'm in love with their pineapple ketchup. And they marked one well done!  Location: right off the 215, a couple cross streets down Windmill.  Total was $24 with change.",

    "text": "I have probably been to bachi burger about 30 to 40 times since they opened in Vegas a few years ago, with at least 25 visits being at this windmill location. Expanding throughout Vegas and now California, it seems that taste has gone down it bit. Perhaps the mastermind of the menu is the one who prepares and cooks the burgers best?  Brought my boyfriend here, and he was disappointed in the oxtail chili cheese fries and in his burger. He loves meat, so he was not pleased when the chili overpowered the fries and he could barely find any oxtail. He asked the server if the oxtail was real and was told yes, but I wish we were given some insight in the oxtail to chili to cheese ratio since we made it foolproof obvious that neither of us tried oxtail chili fries before. I try not to blame the server for he is not the cook and is probably used to the dishes being just...dishes. But, if the server was deliberately holding his tongue to watch us just order things to reach some sort of sales quota, then I would be deeply disappointed.   My boyfriend said the meat in his medium rare KiKi Burger was kind of tasteless, and said the same for my medium rare Miyagi-san. He loves meat so much that he expected more from such a popular gourmet asian fusion burger joint. I still appreciated the Miyagi-san, but I do agree that it has changed and slightly gone down in taste over the years.  For this location, the tonkotsu shio ramen by Shoku Ramen-ya (same management next door) had a delicious broth and tamago. We enjoyed it!  The 3 workers we interacted with were well-mannered, and we appreciate that.",

Now I should let you know that I'm not a fan of hamburgers whatsoever, and Justin knows this yet still chose this place for dinner. Whatever. The place was absolutely packed, as it was a Saturday night. Robin waited for nearly 40 minutes when we got there and we still had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. Crazy busy!  Wow, so this place is definitely a little speedy as all the sides are priced separately. I ordered the regular sized Caesar salad ($7). Robin ordered the ox tail fries - $11 worth of delicious. My salad was not the greatest, but it did come with a little anchovy on top. Justin ordered truffle fries to share and they were delicious, but could have used a little more sauce.   2 burgers, 2 fries and my salad came out to more than $50. It's just a little too spendy for my tastes for what it we received.",

I had to remind him about our drink orders that consisted of a basic coke and two plantation sweet teas and the kona coffee shake.  A table that was seated about 10 minutes after us and was being served by the same server received their drinks before us and they ordered a mixed drink from the bar and our shake came after all our food was at the table.

I could tell they were starting to get a little busy when all of the tables filled up a few moments after we ordered, regardless we were given just as much attention as we would have if they were empty. Genuinely great service!  The Parmesan Truffle Fries were outstanding!!! A sun dried tomato aioli was served beside the fries, it was perfect for dipping & complimented all of the complex flavors of the dish.   I ordered the smallest BBQ Bachi Burger, which was actually quite large- for something priced at only $6. I took some of it home with me, & I can't wait to eat it for a midnight snack. THE BUN- very oriental, & delightfully toasted. My boyfriend & I were extremely satisfied with our burgers (identical, only his was 7 oz, mine was 5 oz).   To anyone who has complained about their presentation- lets get real here, you probably pay $6 for a large combo at McDonalds- did you complain about their presentation too? I liked the simplicity, I would rather my food taste extravagant than just look that way. =]  I have 3 adjectives for them- mouthwatering, cutting edge, & hospitable.",

But what got us what the amazing food!  My party LOVED my burger the best, which was the Spicy Miso Burger, which was a special that night.  My friend orgered the Ronin and my other friend ordered the Kiki burger.  My sister ordered the steamed buns w/short ribs.  All was very good, and we ordered the truffle/parmesan and sweet potatoe fries to share.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate hazelnut cookie ice cream and the strawberry beignets.  Also great!  I love their creative and Asian inspired menu.  They put a lot thought in their presentation and what to add in their burgers and other menu items.  I wanted to try everything!  This was our first time and we are definitely coming back for more!!!",

I promise it'll make you smarter, faster, stronger, but won't increase the length or girth of your.....sentences?  If you're a strict cheeseburger purist, I got one thing to say to you, put an egg in your shoe and beat it.  This place puts an asian touch on burgers (I use the term 'touch' because the term 'fusion' should only be used when speaking about coitus).  Ok, so I'm only going to talk (type up) about the burgers only.  It's Friday and I don't feel like doing anything and I'm sure you don't feel like reading any more than you have to.  I'm glad we have agreed upon this arrangement.  Let's shake on it to make it official.  The Ronin Burger is aptly named.  The Ronin were samurai with no lord back in the day.  In this case, think of the patty as the Samurai.  Even with all the ingredients used in describing this burger, it stood alone.  No master, or in this case, ingredient to follow.  Not a bad thing.  The burger was still good.  Though description of it would lead you to think it was going to be layered with different flavors and whatnot.  The Kalbi burger is like eating Korean BBQ in burger form.  And much like eating the actual Korean BBQ, you'll be burping this up all the way home on that picturesque drive on the 15 southbound.  I would've never have thought about putting kimchee in a burger.  This was better executed than Sadam Hussein was.  You know, with his head all on the ground rolling around and whatnot.  I'll take a couple of those Portuguese donuts for the road. Thanks.",

I ordered a burger Togo about a month ago and they gave me the wrong burger. I picked it up before work and realized at work it was covered in Onions and I am Very allergic to Onions! I called back to speak with the manager and he said he would contact me the next day. After a week of waiting for a response I called back again to talk with a different manager. I was then told she would look into resolving my problem. Another week went by and I did the same thing; call and let them know they never got back to me and this happened 2 more times. I ordered a month ago to the day and all I have done is ordered a burger and fries for $28 which I never ate and nobody has ever contacted me to resolve this problem. Do I know if the food is good; No! Would I like to try it again; why would I go somewhere they don't care about the customer and all they do is push you aside. On a scale of 1-10 on how disrespected I feel from bachi burger would rank somewhere in the 100's. Thank you Bachi burger for bringing me to bashing you on yelp but if you had not lied to me 4+ times I would not do this. Have a wonderful Day! You are lucky I have to choose atleast one star:)",

The server named Bianca told us to wait when there were empty tables. She was rude and showed such attitude when we asked to sit in tables instead of the bar. There are 3-4 empty small tables and that is why we dont get what her problem is. When we finally got seated, my bf went to restroom to wash his hands. I was waiting to order. My bf's experience with the restroom was horrendous. Dirty, no soap, no paper towel. When he got back I was still waiting to order. There were 4-5 servers walking around without helping anyone. I should mention that there was no one coming to even offer us a glass of water. Needless to say we left feeling terrible. We love bachi burgers and every time we decide to come we think of how delicious our burgers are gonna be. But the service put us off every time. I'm sorry but I dont think i will step foot in here anymore because the service sucks. I hope the owners would come and check this place out cuz i think the employees ruined the good name you built for your place.",

    "text": "The Skinny: great steamed buns, great fries (4), service - better wait time for food (3), value - good on the sandwich prices (3).  We decided to brave this place for a second time. We were glad we did. After our previous review where the wait time was well over 30 minutes, we only had to wait about 15 minutes for our food - a vast improvement.   I don't know if it is the timing however we did get there around noon on a holiday Monday. Roughly the same number of tables were there. We did have the same server as the last time and she did a much better job today.  This time we tried the Lonely Bird (a tsukune sandwich), the steamed pork belly sandwiches and their garlic, salt& pepper fries.  I really love tsukune (ground chicken with shiso leaf) and this sandwich really nailed it with the flavours of the shiso aioli. The fear with most ground turkey/chicken burgers is dryness. However Bachi proves that it is not the case. The patty was juicy and delicious. Texturally, it was well balanced with the nice crunch of the onion rings.  The pork belly was a melt-in-your-mouth, succulent slice of heaven encased in a wonderfully, fluffy steamed bun. The mild acidity of the vegetables really cut through the pork's richness. Truly a well thought out dish.  Finally, the garlic, salt & pepper fries were very nice - crispy, salty with a hint of heat from jalapenos. Perfection and yes, very addicting.  I would definitely come again to try out other dishes.",

The pork belly steamed buns were wonderful.  Reminded me of the ones I had at Momofuku milk bar in NY.  The duck steamed buns were just OK, not as good.  My only knock on this place, and reason for not giving it 5 stars, is due to the service.  There were empty tables but our party of five waited about half an hour before we were seated.",

For a Saturday night, when most are out drinking, there was a surprising amount of patrons.  I won't bore you with a rundown of our orders, but I will mention a few things:  - Great presentation of fries, go with a group of 4-6 so you can try em all.  Unless you're a fatty.  - The Vietnamese coffee had a strong hazelnut flavor.  Fail in my book.  - Your burger choice may be hit or miss... but I'm pretty sure you'll have some interesting flavors to talk about.  I think I'll follow Arvin T's lead and build my own solid and regular burger with their quality ingredients.  By no means cheap, come here for a bit of a tasting adventure at a chic spot.  Plus its off strip, so you can claim some street cred for bringing an out-of-towner here.",

First time, I got the turkey burger. It wasn't very good. It had a flavor that was really strong (not in a good way), which probably put its sodium through the roof. Plus, I couldn't stand the minty sauce that came with it. Thankfully, I got to sample the Ronin burgers that my buddies ordered, which were delicious. Second time, I went for the miso burger. The sauce that it was marinated in overpowered the dry burger completely. It was almost like it was doused in soy sauce. A complete mediocre meal. It didn't help that the matcha green tea that I ordered smelled like sea water. Almost made me nauseous.  Not sure if I want to come back to this place again for a third chance. It's rare that I walk out of a restaurant angry. I walk in expecting something wonderful from the raving words that I hear about this place. 2 out of 2 times I was disappointed. The second visit was far more worse than the first, though I must admit that the service was consistently good.  Who knows? Maybe I just ordered wrong during my visits. I hate that these items even exist on the menu to tempt me. There shouldn't be any \"wrong\" items to order on a menu in the first place.",

What I ordered:  Spicy miso burger: meat was cooked just as I had ordered it. The condiments really made the burger, and overall it was just delicious. Salt and pepper garlic fries w/ chili aioli: nice complement to the burgers. I have this thing with fries where I get really dissatisfied with boring and \"typical\" tasting fries. This was definitely not the case. They weren't the best fries I ever had, but they definitely had \"character.\"  Service was also very attentive.

This was an amazing place to explore with your culinary taste buds, but the last two times have been riddled with poor service and poor taste. Three burgers ordered medium and three different versions of medium came out.  Our oxtail chili cheese fries had an overcooked egg and undercooked French fries. We asked for a redone egg and one only ever so slightly came back.   We had an order of fries that came out after I was two bites from done and my sister was half way through her burger. Another reason why all the acclaims and rewards are from years past on the wall.   The flavors for the most part were all very good though. The Kiki, the bahn mi burger and the miyagi san all are excellent takes on burgers, even with the meat not cooked well.   I want to love bachi again, I hope to love bachi again but until I hear something has changed I won't be back",

Somewhat hidden in an unassuming strip mall. Food is anything but. The flavors in the burger I had which was the Kiki smack you right in the face. So juicy and tender. Bun is very soft and warm. Although a good size did not feel stuffed or sluggish after I was done. Ordered a side of fries. Although I wanted to try the Ox tail which Jennifer C. mentioned to me.

I love Japanese cuisine, and I enjoy pursuing the elusive, better-than-In-N-Out, perfect burger.  I only tried the Ronin Burger and the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, but I wasn't left with the idea that I would be back.  (My bill came to about $25 without tip.)  The novelty wore off very quickly.  You'll enjoy your experience, however.  The restaurant itself was very busy--Los Angeles will have one of it's own this Fall, 2012--and the staff was very personable and all smiles.  The food is a new and refreshing twist on the sometimes commonplace hamburger, and the presentations are eye-catching, as you would expect with a Japanese influence.  Myself, I thought what I had ordered, which was highly recommended by our server and host, was too sweet.  I was expecting to bite into something that was much more robust.  Again, I hadn't tried everything; but for now, it's \"been there, done that.\"",

I think they're called chili wings or something like that. They were cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed the flavor! Sweet and spicy. Very good ;-)  Although they had interesting burgers with various toppings....I'm more of a traditional burger girl. I had a cheeseburger with bacon and regular fries. I was extremely pleased. The meat was cooked perfectly and the burger was topped with the most fresh condiments. The bun was steamed perfectly!!!! I didn't like the pineapple ketchup....more of a traditional regular ole ketchup girl.   My boo ordered the spicy miso burger and was EXTREMELY SATISFIED!!!!!! Apparently that burger was popular amongst patrons.   I'll definitely visit again. Maybe I'll try different burgers....",

While we were waiting we already decided what we wanted, but even then it took a while before a waiter got to us after we were seated. Beer took 20 min to arrive and was comped; Burgers took another 15min; Another 20 min after we finished the burgers we tried to cancel the dessert which was ordered initially and then it magically appeared.  It was boxed to go and was also comped. Overall we spent 1:30min which is ridiculous for 2 people at a burger joint. I don't know what their problem was, whether it was a lack of waiters (3) or if their kitchen couldn't handle the capacity. I wouldn't come here on a weekend ever again.",

We only waited about 5 minutes and we were seated. This was our first time here and I noticed they merged with the ramen restaurant next door. Very cool! We looked over the menu and I immediately saw they offered bao sandwiches!! They offered my favorite kind too! The peaking duck bao. Joel ordered Kiki's burger and we shared the truffle parmesan fries.   The fries came out first! They were thin cut, crispy and came drizzled with truffle sauce  over them. I also ordered a side of garlic chili sauce to dip them in. Yum! Next came Joel's burger and my duck bao. Joel's burger was messy!!! It had lots of shiitake mushrooms, a slice of gruyere cheese and a thick juice burger patty. By the time he finished I felt like I needed to hose him down he was so covered in burger and sauce. My bao was tender and the meat was flavorful. It also had a thin slice of egg and radish and came with a side of hoisn sauce. That complimented the bao nicely.   The service was prompt and friendly. I always love when places pay attention and refill my water glass when empty. The Bachi Burger staff fit the bill. The waiter even quickly brought napkins when Joel was messy.   The decor is basic. The wooden benches and chairs are not comfy. They also have a bar you can sit at, but those high chairs didn't look any more comfy.   I think it's great the Bachi has merged with the next door ramen spot. It lets them offer more options and a larger dining place. On the price it is a little expensive. ($3 for a soda. I'll stick with water.)   Bachi Burger was tasty, but I can't say I'd go out of my way to go back anytime soon.",

The garlic fries - nothing special, the garlic didn't even stick to the fries, it was all down at the bottom of the cone.  The sauce that the fries came with did have good flavor, but you only get enough for about half of the fries  All in all - some of the food is very well done and flavorful.  The prices are a bit high for that far off of the strip.  don't see a need to hurry back",

The service was very friendly and the place looks cool.  As far as the burgers, they were a knock out for me!    I had the Bahn Mi.  It was a straight out pho style burger with pickled carrot, veggies, jalapeno and fresh lush basil.  You dip this one in sweet pho sauce.  Very good.  4/5  There was the KiKi which had mushrooms bacon and looked good.  This was lil'bro's so I didn't try it.  The best one was the Miyagi burger.  With fried onions, fried egg a chimichuri/dijon sauce and a wagyu burger.  My it was a masterpiece of a burger. 5/5  The Truffle Fries had a Vietnamese type of truffle peanut butter drizzle and a straight garlic truffle drizzle between.  With a special aioli. It could only be better with actual truffle specks. 4.5/5  All the burgers were on a bun similar to a larger soft sticky bun.  Service and food make this worthy of 5 stars for me.",

However, IMO - the worst idea ever was to merge Shoku and Bachi together. For those that just want a bowl of noodles (which is pretty good) you are thrown in the same dining area as the Bachi customers. Imagine merging two restaurants together but only having half the wait staff. Maybe you're trying to save money, I don't know. But please understand that you don't have enough wait staff. Your tables are only 50-60% filled, yet you have 5+ parties waiting to be seated during peak times for more than 30+ min. This has happened on my last 3 recent visits. Don't you realize you're only hurting your own profits?  You may also want to train your kitchen staff that when people at the table order noodles with takoyaki and a kakuni bowl that you should probably bring those appetizers out \"before\" the noodles and not after.  I love the food, but I don't like how unorganized it is. Get your hard working servers some extra help!",

We went to the Windmill location which was about 20 minutes away. When we got there at 11am, there was already a small line starting to form. I got the grass-fed wagyu burger. It was good but it was a little bit on the sweeter side and I don't like my burgers sweet. I also got a chance to try the spicy miso burger. That was a little salty for me, but again, still very good. The winner of the day? The oxtail chili cheese fries. You will dieeee. Must get!!!   Since our meal was so good, we decided to come back a second time the next day before leaving Vegas. This time around we tried the ramen. It's really rare that a burger joint would also serve ramen, let alone be good at it so I was extremely skeptical. BUT, much to my surprise, the ramen was so good as well! My favorite is the spicy ramen with extra meat. Their meat is sooo fatty and melts in your mouth but it's so good. I suppose being a fatty every once in a while is no biggie :)  Their service is amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive. I will come back here every time I'm in town!",

    "text": "Fancy burger joints are part of the Vegas scene these days.  One, in particular, is known not only for its gourmet burgers w/ an Asian twist, but also for its local ties:  Bachi Burger.  Owner & Food/Beverage Director, Lorin Watada, is a transplanted local (Iolani grad) who now lives in Vegas. His cooking stints included Alan Wong's, Sheraton Hotels, Kahala Mandarin Hotel, & some 7  1/2 years as Corporate Chef w/ Roy's Restaurants, before opening  2 successful Bachi Burger locations in Vegas. The 1st location, just south of the Strip, opened in May 2010 in what was formerly a Dunkin' Donuts location in Windmill Plaza; the 2nd location opened in April 2012 in Summerlin, western Las Vegas. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=fIhDPCnCFfkcOHHi-jOJ3Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>   Having local ties, it is then not a surprise that the reasonably-priced burgers & food are prepared w/ Pacific Rim/Asian influences. Quality burgers are made from Wagyu & Angus beef (price range from $7.50 for an Angus beef burger to $26 for Wagyu beef/foie gras); steamed sandwiches (Peking duck in bao, pork belly); fish sandwiches; & even a Vietnamese \"ban-mi\" sandwich.  The sandwiches are served w/ Asian-inspired flavors & ingredients commonly found in Hawaii, e.g., miso goma dressing, shiitake, kalbi marinade, kimchee, furikake, lemongrass, hoisin mayo, mizuna, lup chong, unagi, & others. There are also appetizers & salads, w/ one of their popular dishes being the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries served with chili aioli & a fried egg. As much as possible, ingredients are natural, organic, & sourced locally.    We loved the delicious burgers, as the flavors of the various ingredients just complemented each other. We had:  - Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger ($13.50). Came w/ chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, carmelized bacon, crispy onion rings.  There was no way you could eat this burger, or any of the other burgers, w/ the sandwich in your hand. I had to slowly dissect it to make it smaller; the onion rings were perfect crispy w/ a flavorful batter. The Wagyu beef just melted in my mouth & was so delicious w/ the egg, bacon, & furikake. The hamburger bun was also a winner - fresh Taiwanese sweet bun that is rich, buttery, & chewy w/ a nice shiny glaze on it. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=ca3W5wdhrSem8ERFXnjI3g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>    - Spicy Miso Burger ($10.50). Came w/ red onion, Shishito pepper, mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, fried egg, apple vinaigrette. Lots of flavor in this slightly spicy burger from the sweet, green, &slightly spicy Shishito peppers; bold & salty flavors from the miso; & a sweet, tangy oil/vinegar flavor from the vinaigrette. The same Taiwanese bun was used to make it even more flavorful. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=6pgTs0isXtKI5nXRLSfe3g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>   - Salt & Pepper French Fries ($4). Garnished w/ slices of hot Jalapeno peppers, Maui onion sea salt, & garlic chili aioli & served in a classy stainless steel cone. Thin fries that are perfectly fried, crisp on the outside & moist on the inside, & seasoned perfectly.  The aioli was perfectly spiced & creamy for easy dipping; we also enjoyed dipping them in a tasty pineapple-tomato ketchup. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=I6fySTopYSja57efTht35w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>   The restaurant's name, \"Bachi,\" takes on a dual meaning:  a shortened version of the word \"hibachi\" which is a style of grilling; & a Japanese term meaning karma, i.e., to treat others how you would like to be treated & implied in a negative way. (I assume the name is more in line with the grilling aspect rather than negative karma.)  Service was adequate for this clean, contemporary 75-seat restaurant w/ exposed pipes on the ceiling to give the decor an industrial look. There are stylish recessed & track ceiling lights hovering over classy dark wood tables. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=KJAhWE22AH5ShHamqwWWOQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>   Bachi Burger was featured on the Food Network on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives w/ Guy Fieri. This stint has helped to generate the crowds that it has been attracting.  I would love to return to try their other burgers/sandwiches/sides. Hawaii residents will love the Asian twist to these burgers/sandwiches, as the ingredients are all too familiar here.  A must-do for Hawaii residents traveling to Vegas or better yet, maybe a Bachi Burger in Hawaii?",

We came after playing at glow zone and as soon as we came one of the waitresses looked frustrated and told us it would take 20 minutes for her to clean a table that had no guests sitting in it. The entire party was so tired and we had 5 of us at the time so we just decided to stay because we were already there. After a very long time we finally seat and the same server came and asked us for our drink order. We never got our drink orders until after we were almost done with our food and we had asked multiple times to different servers. That made everyone mad but what could we do? We got our appetizers which was truffle fries and regular fries that was okay, but didn't get those until 30 minutes after we ordered it. Then 30 minutes after that half of our food came out. I got the miyagi San burger which was good that's why I gave the two stars, but most us were finished with our food and we noticed one person never got their order! That made me very angry. So many things had already taken so much of our time plus we were really tired and now one member of our group Head waited over an hour and a half for their plain burger with tomatoes and lettuce? I was very disappointed to say the least with their service that night.",

The hostess who greeted us was very polite but our other party wasn't here yet and she had said that we needed to wait for the rest of the party before seating us! I thought omg what's the point if we could have have been seated and got our beverage order first. That was the only downfall.  I ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and the kiki's burger and the fries just tasted too salty. It was a good idea to have used oxtail because the meat is really tender and moist. The burger was the best thing. Nice and juicy on the inside and the flavors was all there.  My sis ordered the shoyu ramen and the taste profile is amazing perfect for a rainy day or if you have a cold. Overall, this place might need some work in customer seating but I would come back for the burgers.",

I've tried every single burger they have between myself and my friends and they are all good but by far my favorite has to be the Miyagi San burger. It's amazing and you have to give it a try!

    "text": "Just had to try this most talked about eatery.  This one is located in south Las Vegas...pretty easy to find. Our party of three got there at 9:30pm on a Sunday night.  It was busy, but there was only one couple ahead of us, so the wait was less than 10 mins.  The service was prompt and friendly.  Just viewing the menu was interesting.  This place has some really, REALLY exotic burgers (understatement of the day)!  However, it's a huge plus that they have the ingredients listed for each of the items on the menu.  For appetizers, we got the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, the Pickled Vegetables, and two dinner salads.  These were all fresh and very tasty.  The Oxtail Fries were huge.  We were quite impressed with these starters which only added to the anticipation of our burgers.  I got the Spicy Miso Burger, the wifey got the Ronin Burger, and the daughter had the Kiki Burger.  They were all pretty huuuge.  My Spicy Miso was not spicy at all, which didn't bother me a bit, but I suppose some you who order spicy, may expect spicy.  Well, the burger tasted just out of this world.  I loved it, and mopped it up.  It was tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  No strong miso taste at all.  The other two with me also enjoyed their burgers.  They're both smaller eaters and had to doggy-bag half of their burgers each.  The bun they use for the burgers is more like a sweet bread, which certainly adds to the exoticness.  All-in-all, this was a great experience.  Great staff, great service, awesome food.  This is a new must go spot for us.  I must say that this blows away the Shake Shack, which I reviewed last week.  I couldn't give it 5 stars as it was a bit pricey.  But then, I'm a bit cheap. Lol",

After a hot pocket, mcdonald's french fries and chicken nuggets, cuties and trader joe's salt and vinegar chips on the ~4.5 hour drive to Las Vegas we still had room for Bachi Burger.   Met up with my cousin and friend (who live in LV), they suggested the meatball spot/place at Town Square but I really wanted to go to Bachi Burger, so they met up with us there. :)  While waiting for them, we perused the pictures on the yelp app and decided we HAD to get the oxtail chili cheese fries.   We also shared the kiki burger, which was good but nothing to write home about. My cousin talked about this one drink they have that has like a burnt marshmallow on it, and when we asked the waitress about it she raved about it, sadly they only have it at their other location. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.  Their dessert menu is limited, my friend was craving mochi and the girl said we could go next door. Haha  Overall, Bachi burger is still satisfying..excited that they're opening one in LA! (David G. said so!)  After checking in, taking a nap, and gambling we went to eat again!

When I was eating the burger, the bun was like smashed super thin (like a pancake).  I would eat here again and try a different burger.  We had the fries also with the pineapple ketchup- nothing special here.  It was just fries.",

    "text": "This off-the strip burger joint is a hidden gem for those visiting Vegas.  I came here based on a few of my friends' recommendation and rave reviews of this place and I was not disappointed.  We were seated within 5 minutes during lunchtime.  Our group of 5 we got:  Bachi Burger (wagyu), Kiki Burger, Duck Bao, Short Rib Bao, and the oxtail chili fries.  I pretty much liked everything I ate.  The oxtail chili had lots of beans in it, which some of my friends didn't like as much, but I thought they were fine.  I think the burgers are better than the bao's though, so stick to those.  The parmesean truffle fries are good, but not spectacular, I've had better truffle fries.  The pricing is just right, everything is in the 7-12 dollars range or so, so pretty cheap for the delicious food.  Highly recommended place to check out to or leaving vegas!",

    "text": "I haven't been to Bachi Burger in years, basically since it became hip and everyone wrote articles about it and the masses descended.     The burgers I remember as being good but I make burgers at home so really don't go to burger joints in general.  I actually hadn't planned to go but the Izakaya in the same shopping center that was my plan turned out to be closed.  So I decided to go to Shoku Ramen only to discover it is now combined with Bachi.  Worked for me, there was a French fry dish I'd heard a lot about and I figured it would make an interesting combo with a bowl of Ramen.  I ordered the Tonkatsu Shio, which came out quickly and was very good. I actually prefer it to Monta's, even if the style (which is the same as Monta and everybody frikking else which is annoying) isn't the kind I prefer.  Sadly they did not have the oxtail fries on the menu or anything that looked like it so that was a miss.  Although, probably for the best because the Ramen filled me up.  I also ordered the Portuguese donuts, which do not come with a filling, but do come with ice cream. Both ice cream and donuts were good but not anything spectacular.  The place was very busy but the staff were responsive and friendly and somehow even managed to sneak in a staff photo while taking care of everything.  All in all, given how close it is for me, I might have to put it back on my radar as a place to go, especially since Shuseki closed taking with it the style of ramen I like.",

I love it!  2 stars = alone just for the Miyagi Son burger; best burger ever!  Caramelized bacon?  With an egg inside?  Come on, what's not to love!    3 stars = for having pork belly and duck steam buns.  I love these things and I can come here to get them anytime I want? Score!  4 stars = for making my boyfriend want to try every burger on the menu until he's tried them all.  So far not one has disappointed him and he's had the Ronin, Mr Ho's, Miyagi Son, and the Black & Green.  He loved every bite of each!  5 stars = for having 3 kinds of edamame, and 3 kinds of french fries to try with the huge variety of different burgers on the menu.  Variety is key to any restaurant so that it keeps customers curious to come back and try more!  Sorry Bachi Burger to have ever doubted you!  I'll be back to try the rest of the menu!  See you real soon!",

These burgers have been specially crafted to meet a specific flavor profile, making changes to them really diminishes the flavor they were designed for. Well worth your time & $$!",

The service has always been hit or miss, but I've always returned because the food proved to be on point. With that said, my last dining experience was terrible - service and food.   1. Our beer glasses were delivered hot and dirty. 2. Our fries were delivered cold. 3. Their burgers are served medium, so I always ask for medium well. My boyfriend asked for medium. Mine was served bloody and his was served well done. He ate his unhappily but I could not stomach mine and after we had to literally flagged down the waiter, I sent mine back. He brought back the same burger (which I had cut into) with the meat cooked to well. Again, not medium well. I found it to be odd that they would just reheat the patty, but oh well, I ate it. Mind you, this was delivered well after my boyfriend had finished his burger (I told him to go ahead because I did not want his to get as cold as our fries).  4. Nothing was done to make this right. I posted on Facebook, tagged them, and sent a comment to their fan page ... and nothing.   I realize dining experiences aren't always perfect; however, they should have comped my burger or offered a free dessert. This is why I turned to their fan page on Facebook and still nothing was done to rectify the situation. I'm saddened to say, we will not return to our once fav spot to eat.",

The food is freshly made and I was able to sample some of the other burgers that a couple of my friends ordered. I definitely recommend you try the \"Miyagi son \"Burger, and also if you order any other burger and it happens to come with a sauce, definitely use it. I am NOT one to usually put sauces on my burgers but after halfway through my order I decided to give it a try and it truly brings out the flavor in your meal. Something that may need improvement, is that when you go enter the restaurant there is a reception area where they will take your name and seat you, but 50% of the time there was nobody there. We had to wait about 5 minutes for somebody to finally show up and take our name down, but were a little surprised when somebody just rolled in with a suitcase and wrote her name down on the list.???",

Approaching the host stand, a tall brown-haired host told us the wait would be about 45 minutes for a party of 2, which is fine, considering its a busy place on a Friday night. After about 10 minutes, we were trying to decide if we wanted to stay or go somewhere else so we decided to see if there would be a table sooner considering parties of 2 are the easiest to seat (I work in a busy, upscale Strip restaurant, as a host).  I told my boyfriend to go check with the host and we were treated with complete disrespect. The host said,\"Well, since you waited 10 minutes and I told you 45, that means that you have 35 minutes left. Do the math in your head.\"   Wow, right?!   If I said that to my guests, I would not have a job.  I also called the manager today and told him what had happened and he did not seem to care, at all. He just listened, then said \"thank you, have a nice day.\"   Their burgers are good but not that great to be treated like that.",

    "text": "Celebrating the Husband's birthday (two months ago), we were looking for somewhere new that was children-friendly and had a variety of things to order.  Bachi Burger was his place of choice.  I called ahead to make reservations with our large party so that the table would be set up before we get there.    Once everyone was seated, and drink orders were in place, we got to break down the menu a bit.  Since the Ronin Burger \"Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma,  Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, Yuzu Citrus Aioli\" ($8) got a lot of praise, the Husband split that along with the Kalbi Burger \"Ground Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, House Made Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo ($8) with his friend. The Ronin was the favorite of the two he tried, enough that he ordered another to share.  The cole slaw gave it a nice contrast and bite.  Whereas the added kim chee to the Kalbi made it different.  One thing that the Husband thought could be improved was the size of the burger.  He felt they were a bit small, and one burger won't cut it for a growing man (even with fries).  I started off with the Organic Edamame Soybean \"Sauteed with Garlic Butter, Truffle Oil\" ($3) because who doesn't love a little truffle oil in their food.  It was good, greasy, but definitely yummy!  It's cooked in garlic butter, and I'm not used to cooking my edamame in any kind of butter!  You can't say no to their Truffle Parmesan Fries \"Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle Porcini Cream, Sun Dried Tomato Aioli\" ($4).  It comes in a nice cone with dipping sauce and it had all the kids grabbing some.  Another thing they do great is their Sweet Potato Fries \"Crispy Sweet Potato dusted with Sea Salt Yuzu Citrus Aioli\" ($4).  They are sweet, but salty and the dipping sauce complements it well.  The kids loved their Chili Fried Chicken \"Marinated in Ginger, galic, soy sauce.\" ($6) that they ordered a second round.  To close out, we ordered the Portuguese Donuts \"Vietnamese Cinnamon, Coffee Gelato\" ($5) with a birthday candle in it.  (Sometimes restaurants throw in dessert for free when celebrating a birthday, it's not the case here.)  They were donut holes with lots of cinnamon sugar on it.  The accompanying gelato didn't taste like coffee much.  Service - we got the waiter that everyone talks about.  He really does try, a bit too hard, and that's where he goes wrong.  You can't blame the guy for trying, right?  They could ultimately learn to work as a team though since we definitely had to wave down our waiter for things, and when we tried asking other staff for things, they just passed it on to our waiter.    Overall, Bachi Burger definitely had some interesting takes on their version of meat between bread. There were some high points and okay points.    3.5 stars",

    "text": "My husband and I came here on our last day in Las Vegas, and had been waiting since we planned our wedding and seen them featured on Triple D. We ordered the Oxtail Fries which are absolute heaven. Only need to caution they come loaded with jalapenos, and my husband isn't extremely fond of them ( i love them) and accidentally ingested a few pieces since they were covered by the delicious melty cheese gooeyness and chili cheese oxtail mixture. Not greasy, well balanced appetizer, wish there was one here in FL!. We ordered a burger each, he ordered the Kikki and I got the Miyagi. Both medium, served pink in the center, but not raw or bleeding, perfectly cooked. Meat still had the grilled taste, wasn't over seasoned, over all the burgers were well made. Definately favorite part was the fries, I was sad I didn't have room to try those yummy milkshakes listed, maybe next time!",

Hands down the best burger I've ever had. We also ordered a side of fries with the pineapple ketchup which were good as well. The portions were great and filling.  On top of that the service and management were wonderful.  Can't wait for my next experience here.",

The food choices is definitely asian-inspired where it brings multiple cultures mixed together very well.   It had a burger with Foie Gras which was pricey but very very well made. They had some burgers with eggs in it which was a huge plus for me as I'm an eggs guy!  Their pork belly steam buns was point on and just fantastic!   The nacho fries was just over the top!  Red Velvet smoothie really tasted like it! I only wished they were generous of the portion especially when it was $5!!

On paper, the burger sounded interesting, but in my mouth, it was amazing!  I recommend this burger to anyone that visits Bachi Burger.  You will not be disappointed.  Almost too good to be True considering the base ingredients involved, but all positivity here!  Service was OK....  The server forget our drinks and didn't really provide informative responses to our questions on the menu items....  But if you are in Vegas, this eatery is a must-visit!  I hear they are opening an LA location....",

    "text": "We went twice in two days, so...yeah. Somehow, my mom conned me into sharing with her both nights so that she could order wimpy non-burgers and feel cute and semi-virtuous while chomping down on half of my tasty meat creations.  Visit #1   Miyagi-san Burger - Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, Onion Rings - I love all these things, especially egg, on my burgers. Yes, I love egg even more than bacon. Everything together was...well, it's turning my mouth on just thinking about it. So good. So very, very good.  Peking Duck Buns - Ordered without cilantro - The egg was a nice touch, but  eh, give me real peking duck at a Chinese restaurant.  Truffle Parmesan Fries - Love the black truffle porcini cream. I could do without the sun dried tomato aioli, though. Just give my heathen self regular ketchup.  Going again the next night was actually not my idea, but I had no objections.  Visit #2  Kiki's Burger - Shiitake, Enoki, & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Gruyere, Garlic Chili Aioli - I love mushrooms and cheese, so I thought I might like this more than the Miyagi-san. It was fantastic, but the Miyagi-san was way better.  Pork Belly Steamed Buns - Again, ordered without cilantro - Honestly, I know it's trendy, but I am just not into ordering these Chinese bun items at restaurants. I can slap this together at home in about 30 seconds. Exactly like the duck buns but with pork (duh). If you live in a place where you can't get Chinese pork belly I guess this would be exciting.  Salted Caramel Shake - I had sort of wanted to have this the night before and decided the second visit was a sign for me to get it. It was very good but unsurprisingly very heavy. In all honesty, I shouldn't have ordered this. It was overkill.  More Truffle Parmesan Fries!  Because we went pretty late at night, there was no wait. Service was okay. In my crosshairs for future visits are the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (several eaters needed) and Shogun Burger (Foie Gras my love!). Highly recommended.",

Burgers came out first and were delicious. 2 of the 3 fries came half way through the burgers. Third fry came out as we finished burgers. Waiter apologized both as he delivered first 2 fries and again as he delivered the very late third fry, but didn't stick around long enough to see we were just about finished. Tried the third order of fries and they were luke-warm. Very disappointing. Couldn't find our waiter to get our bill, either. We had to ask the hostess to help us. She could tell we were frustrated and asked if we wanted to talk to management. We said no, just frustrated and needed to leave for a show. Waiter came back, saw the almost untouched fries, and asked if we wanted a box. A good waiter would have offered to refund the fries, since he knew it wasn't delivered as it should've been, but he didn't. Another disappointment.  Hard to say we'll be back for the delicious burgers.",

It was definitely busy for a weekend, but that was to be expected.  The host took down our name and quoted an estimated time of seating to be around 15-20 minutes. We waited patiently, the host did a great job controlling the flow of the restaurant and seated us right around the quoted wait time.    We sat down and Jade greeted us with a smile. She was friendly, prompt, and professional. Some of us had not been there before, so she went through the menu and addressed all the questions that some of us had. She suggested some cocktails and drinks along with her favorites on the menu. We proceeded with some shared appetizers and that arrived, we ordered our entrees. We loved the fact that everyone was served at the same time with entrees and our drinks were constantly filled. Jade checked up on us frequently and was very engaging, yet she let us have our space when needed. Since there was 9 of us, a good variation of the menu was ordered. The ramen I had was perfect! Not too salty, not to spicy, it was perfect! Everyone who ordered burgers was touting how well it was prepared and the cocktails were a hit. We loved that the manager Erika not only came by to say hello and check up on us, but she is every engaging with the entire restaurant.  She even ran some of our food to our table.  At the end of our night, dessert was ordered. Can't remember what we had but it was wonderful, definitely satisfied our sweet tooth! Jade asked if we wanted split checks for such a large party, we declined but was pleasantly surprised that the check was already split based on seating position. Not only was it split in each seating position, it was done correctly. We were impressed not just but the deliciousness of the food, the hustle and bustle of the restaurant, but also the staff. They were all friendly and definitely was a hit with everyone. We will for sure see you all soon! Bravo!",

Burger came with raw onions not grilled, he was told by server that he needed to order caramelized onions. Plus the staff disagreed with him about grilled vs caramelized onions. I guess they've never heard the customers always right??? I ordered mixed seasonal salad with free range chicken. The salad came and it was arugula, radicchio, sliced carrots and 4 cubes of chicken with skin on it. When I questioned the server I was told can I get you anything else. The kitchens been slammed today. I said no just charge me for the side salad. Not worth the wait!!!!!! If you have to wait then the food/kitchen service suffers......",

    "text": "Food definitely gets 5 stars!!! Going to a restaurant begins with the experience of the ambiance, service, and food quality. You walk in the front door and there's a tiny hostess stand with a \"waiting\" area of about 4ft by 8ft. They're very busy so after putting our name down & qoated an hour we were told to wait on the patio, or if we wanted a drink to go to the counter/bar, which was 2 ft from the hostess stand. It was a claustrophobics nightmare. The layout needs to be adjusted badly. Having one guy serve drinks to everyone, & I mean EVERYONE, servers, guests waiting, takeout orders, is crazy!! We waited 20 min in this long line stretching around peoples tables, which was awkward for them and us. Who wants to be surrounded by extrememly hungry guests while you're trying to eat at your table?! Then when we finally got up to the top, one of the servers told the hostess to start telling people to go to their other location. She turns to us and says, \"If you want to go to our other location, we can be seated faster.\" HAHA, that's in Summerlin, and we've already waited 30 minutes. That's the most rediculous thing i've heard. We sat on the patio which was 100 degrees outside and wasn't even like an actual patio, more like my un-occupied neighbors backyard patio with metal chairs and uneven tables. The restaurant wasn't much better then outside. For a well known restaurant, you'd think they could afford better a/c. They had floor fans in corners of the restaurant, which just blew hot air since it was soo hot in there already. I have never gone through such agony to try a burger in my life. Only getting take-out from now on. When we finally got a table, thank goodness we already had bought drinks because it took forever to get one from our server, granted they were busy yes, but when we're dieing of heat stroke, I wan't WATER!!! The staff you could tell were all over the place. No organization, or leadership it seemed. I grew up in this industry and just as fast as you go up, you can go down, and it's hard to go back up from there. The water had no ice in it, the food took forever, we're overheating from having to wait outside in the middle of summer, because inside waiting area was built for toddlers. But, the food was great.",

Got the Bahn-Mi Burger and Kiki's Burger and they were both delicious.  The beef/pork/shrimp patty oh the Bahn-Mi burger was awesome and house-made fish sauce - so good!!!  Perfect balance of tangy and sweet.  I couldn't get enough of it.  Kiki's Burger was really good as well and the caramelized bacon and onion compote added a whole other degree of flavor to the burger.  May be too sweet for some people, but I loved it.  Both burgers were cooked perfectly medium and I'm sure would have been delicious on their own, but the different toppings on each made them out of this world.  I haven't attempted to get a burger since eating here because I know it won't compare.  Didn't get the oxtail chili fries or the BBQ pork buns from other reviews because we were so focused on the burgers but saw other people getting them and  they looked delicious - will have to try next time.  Definitely check out if you're in the Vegas area!",

When we stepped through the door of windmill address restaurant, I was already impressed with whole ambiance of the place..  Not your typical burger place that's for sure..  After taking a look at the menu, I was floored by the concepts of all the food!  Even the alcoholic drinks were intriguing!!  After constant deliberations..  I decided on the Miyagi-San burden and to share some oxtail chili fries...  The fries was simply awesome!!!!  Best fries in the world for at least a few minutes..  Till the Truffle Parmesan fries landed..  We have a new champion!!!  Unreal!!!  I was thinking someone needs to open one of these back home in Hawaii!!  The burgers had then came out and it was perfect..  Thick and juicy burgers!!  I was content!!  By far..  The best burger place I ever went to EVER!!",

I normally don't like to eat fat but this was soo orgasmic.  Ronin Burger:: loved it!  So much flavor, it was party in my mouth!  Kiki's Burger:: only took a few bites and it was good but I prefer the Ronin burger  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries::  pretty damn good.  Surprisingly the chili was good.  Huge portions!

I called and put my order in for pick up at 11am and told the girl that took the order that I would be there at 12:45 to pick it up, giving them plenty of time to plan for my arrival. I showed up promptly at 12:45 only to be told that my order was never put in. I waited 15 minutes for them to make my food before trying to grab one of the waitresses for a status on where the heck my order was. When I was finally able to get the attention of one, she checked and still not order put in. I could see that many of the people at tables were very upset with the service as well because it was a packed house and there were only 2 girls waiting tables. When I finally got my food it was 1:20 and by then I was so upset that I didn't even want to eat anymore. I ordered the \"Banh-Mi\" Burger and it was cooked to perfection which I think is the only thing that saved this place for me. I have to say that I might go back because the flavors are great but I will only do so if I have a few hours to kill.",

My friends couldn't wait so they went to Subway to grab some food before eating lunch.  I thought that the truffle fries were amazing, probably my favorite! I ordered the Ronin burger. The yuzu sauce created a good balance for the burger, but at the same time, I didn't think that they complemented that well.  I think that this place is just average.

Katie H. saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and was meaning on coming here for a while. Glad we went to Vegas together so we could try this fine establishment together.  We took a seat at the bar which was great cus we got to talk a little with our waiter (tall red-head with a pony-tail) while he mixed drinks and such. Super nice guy with great food descriptions cus he made me want to try the entire menu, and I don't even eat pork or shell fish!!  We started with the black truffle parmesan fries. I mean, everything with truffle has to be good, right? But these were exceptional! Seasoned with just the right amount of spices, chives, parmesan flakes, truffle oil, and (surprise!) gravy! Suuuuuper good! Oh and with a sundried tomato aoli dip. Mmm mm mmmm!  Ok burgers. I got the Miyagi-San burger. I was nearly crying (and definitely licking my fingers...hell my whole hand) from the pure insanely good quality and tastes in my mouth. Beef medium, thinly fried onion rings, and an over-easy (not drippy!) egg. Buns were toasted, soft, sweet and yet so perfectly matched with the burger contents. Amazing, I was actually really sad when I finished eating.  They need to bring this place to LA, they will make millions! Until then, I look forward to coming back during my next trip to Vegas and trying more from the menu, even their cool cocktail and beer options.   One of the best quality burgers I've ever had. Well done Bachi Burger.",

    "text": "I first went to Bachi Burger last summer. My story seems to match everyone else's - good food but slow service. Shortly after my review, I received a message from Ehren stating that they had made improvements. I'm happy to report that this is indeed the case. Granted, I don't know how much faster the food came out. For sure, it didn't take 40 minutes this time. We had a large group of Yelpers and many ordered appetizers that trickled out at various times. Also, time isn't so much an issue when you're enjoying the company of a big group. Still, I noticed little things that demonstrate their attention to detail and I could tell that they've put in the work to improve.  So how was the food? The food quality at Bachi Burger has never been a concern. On this visit, I went with the Bachi Fish. I also went all out and added their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries to my order. The Bachi Fish was out of this world. Easily one of the best fish sandwiches I've ever had, the cod was perfectly cooked and the flavors mingled together to create an enjoyable experience in each bite. As for the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, they were good. The thing is, they might as well have been regular Chili Cheese Fries. I could definitely see there was Oxtail in it. I just wish it was more prominent.  The advantage of being in a big group is in the sampling of other people's dishes. Elnino ordered the Chili flavored Edamame and they were delicious. Someone else passed around a plate of Bachi Chili Fried Chicken. They were tender, flavorful, and came with a great dipping sauce. For me, the huge surprise was the Bachi Pickles platter that Nelson ordered. In particular, those cloves of garlic were insanely good. I'm definitely ordering that next time.  Well done Bachi Burger. You've really changed my perception of your establishment. My only regret is that it took me so long to come back.",

My favorite is the kalbi burger. I love the marinade and the kimchee and spicy mayo they use. I could smell this marinated beef patty from outside. In loooove with the oxtail chili cheese fries! Every time I bring someone here, that's a hit. Went one time and finally got to try the pork belly buns, but unfortunately the pork belly was cold when we got it, kind of congealed already. My family eats a lot of pork belly and being Chinese, I'm familiar with similar dishes. My friend and I were highly disappointed. I love their strawberry jasmine lemonade! So good ESP in the LV heat. Never seen the combo anywhere else.   They also opened a ramen house next door. You can order from both menus. I'll be back to try the ramen (but probably not until the winter) and to give those pork belly buns another try.",

Probably won't be stopping by again unfortunately.",

We eat Ramen in Las Vegas and San Diego all the time and never had such salty broth. The waiter apologized and brought it back after 10 minutes. Nothing got changed. I didn't want to complain anymore. Just ate the very salty noodle and couldn't eat the broth. Plus, my father-in-law's Wagyu burger's meat was cold. Very disappointed.",

Took almost 10 minutes to get seated and 15 at the table to even be acknowledged by the waiter. The pickled vegetables were decent and the pork belly bun was better. However, the waiter never brought small plates so we can actually eat and not make a mess every where; another waiter brought us some. Once finished with the appetizers we staked the plates and even though our waiter came by the table a few tomes he never took our dirty dishes away. Another waiter took them away when he brought our food. The spicy miso burger was 4 star worthy. The cocktails were about 4 stars even though our waiter tried to mess it upby only giving half an orange slice instead of  a full one; if you know anything about cocktails youll understand why thats a big deal. Once done eating we waited about 15 minutes and the waiter didnt come by with the check, instead we had to go ask another waiter for our check. The waiter was also stacking tickets; meaning hes run around to 5 tables taking orders then dropping them all off at the same time slamming the kitchen and making life more difficult for everyone in the long run. He also yelled in the restaurant \"everybody having a good time\" but in a sarcastic im stressed out way that should never happen in a restaurant. They also didnt have ingredients to make my original cocktail, after we orded and the food was about to come out (long wait) the waiter informs us they ran out of avocado for the burger, and still tried to charge us for the added avocado. They ran out of glassware for beer.",

Not clear if that intentional or a bit of cook laziness for a dish made too many times. The other accoutrements were also underwhelming but that may have been to let the patty shine (good flavor there). Fries were NOT worth the extra money. Staff overall had a solid pleasantness to them. Not impressed that one of the cooking staff was camping by the front door where customers come in - hope management can fix that.",

We walked to the bar to wait, and less than 5 minutes later, we got seated! Awesome  We got seated and our server introduced herself as Aubrey.  I ordered the Bachi Fish and added grilled onions and roasted garlic. I also ordered the Parmesan truffle fries with added garlic and fried egg (because I can't get the oxtail fries - I don't eat meat). So I made my own version sans meat with drizzled chili garlic aioli lol.   My friend Mike L ordered the Shogun Burger (with wagyu beef and unagi - $25 burger!) He really liked it and thought it was worth the amount he paid.  My friend Stella K ordered the Spicy Miso Burger, which our waitress highly recommended as her favorite burger, and she added grilled onions.   My friend Ritchie J ordered the Miyago, which he really liked too.  When our food came out, our waitress Aubrey fucked up our order and brought two bachi fish burgers, when we only ordered one... My bachi fish burger had no garlic either, although I specifically said to add garlic. Once we were almost all done with our burgers, my friend's spicy miso burger came out... How could our waitress get her order wrong when she's the one who recommended the burger? ... Horrible service. We also ordered the pork buns, but when my friend's miso burger came out we asked where our pork buns were and she hadn't even placed the order!  The food was good, but the service was shit. If I ever do go back to Bachi burger, I wouldn't go to this location.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time a few months back. I had never heard of it and had no expectations other than some of my friend saying it was a really good burger place.   Went with a group of about 15 so we had to wait about 20-25 minutes which was fine considering our group took a little while to filter in.   Everyone on yelp and in person raved about the oxtail chili cheese fries. So we got a couple orders to share amongst the group. All I had to say was... OMG!! The chili was flavorful. The fries were my perfectly fried in my opinion: nice and crispy on the outside with the right amount of creamy potato goodness on the inside. The oxtail moist and delicious.   Per the server's suggestion, I ordered the Miyagi-San for my burger. When it came, it looked good. It was a pretty hefty burger. But, nothing will compare to that first bite. I died. It felt like the perfect fusion of a burger and Asian flavors. Perfectly cooked to my medium-rare order. Juicy. Savory. Simply amazing.   A lot of people compare it to Umami Burger over here in CA. In my opinion, I liked Bachi better. But I hear it's a pretty close race and all a matter of preference (much like the in-n-out / shake shack debate).   Fast forward to this past weekend...  I took a group of friends who had never been here before. I told them it was definitely worth the price (~$10-$26 for a burger).   We got a few appetizers because it was our only meal that day. Ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, truffle Parmesan fries, and pork belly buns.   While all delicious, the pork belly buns were definitely the hit! The pork belly was so moist and melted in your mouth. For some, these were the highlight of the whole meal!  For our burgers, a lot of my friends ordered the Miyagi-San per my suggestion and they loved it! The few that ordered something different (myself included; spicy miso, kalbi, and banh mi burgers) still thought they were good, but not to the same degree as the Miyagi-San.   Would definitely recommend this to everyone whenever they're in Vegas! And I hope the one in LA is completed soon so I can treat my stomach to this amazingness more often!",

My truffle parmesan fries have been served cold and overcooked, which I always look forward to. It seems that the price of fame (featured on Diners, Drive-ins and dives) has caught up to them. Time to find a new fav burger joint. A plus.....the staff is always friendly, but that's not enough to keep me coming back.",

    "text": "It's been a while since my last review... since mid-2011 apparently, but after eating at this place this past weekend I just HAD to give this place a review.  YES, THIS PLACE IS THAT GOOD!!!  I went to visit a friend who's working in Vegas, and decided to hit this place up since I was craving a good burger.  I was debating between this place and Gordon Ramsey Burgr (mainly since I'm a fan of Ramsey... how can you not be?)  After studying up both yelp reviews for Bachi and Ramsey... I decided on Bachi.  I HAVE NO REGRETS!!  Although, to be honest, I did also end up going to Ramsey a few days later... Ramsey was nothing special, and definitely paled in comparison to Bachi.  But this is a review for Bachi, not Ramsey, so my apologies, I digress.  BACK TO BACHI!!  My friend and I went there Friday night, shortly after I arrived in Vegas.  I would say we got to Bachi close to around 745pm.  It's located in a medium-sized shopping plaza off the strip of Vegas.  Nothing about this plaza screams out that they are hiding the treasure trove that is Bachi.  There was already a good amount of ppl waiting outside Bachi at the time we got there;  when we asked to put our names on the wait-list, we were told that there would be a wait of around 30 minutes.  The inside of the restaurant is pretty big, they have a quite a few tables and lots of TVs hanging around... very modern and trendy.  They also have a bar area that was pretty empty, my friend and I just decided to sit at the bar.  I was hungry from my drive, and I wanted to eat!  After perusing the menu, I decided to go for the MIYAGI BURGER, along with an order of TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES.  My friend wanted to eat a little lighter so he ordered the Sausage appetizers and a Salad.... whatever, he's weird.  The restaurant was busy, so my food did take a while to come out... I think it was around 30 minutes or so until I got my food, but ohhhhh boy was it worth the wait!!  The Miyagi Burger was just gorgeous... everything was stacked neatly onto each other.  It looks like one of those burgers that you would see on a TV commercial.  When I took my first bite, I felt like I was in heaven.  The bun was nice and fluffy, and the wagyu patty was oh so juicy and oh so perfectly cooked.  Yes, I am a huge fan of bacon (what guy isn't?), but for some reason... I am not a fan of bacon in my burger.  Not the case here!  All the ingredients here, especially the caramelized bacon and the fried egg, worked so well with the burger.  Nothing was overpowering... everything just served as a perfect complement to accentuate the wonderful taste of the Miyagi burger as a whole.  The burger was a good-size, but I managed to finish the entire thing in about 5 minutes... maybe even less!  The only time I stopped was so I could take a few breathes, and tell my friend how delicious the burger was.  By the time I finished the burger, my plate was a mess from all the juices that had seeped out... but none of the juices got onto my clothes, so no biggie.  The truffle fries were really good too.  Not too oily, not too salty, the dipping sauces were good, although I didn't find them necessary.  What distinguished these truffle fries from other truffle fries I had was the brown sauce that was layered on. I'm not sure exactly what the brown sauce was... I thought it was gravy, but gravy isn't listed as one of the ingredients on the menu, so maybe it was the black truffle porcini cream...?  Either way, the brown sauce was soooooo good, I just wish the fries came with more of that brown sauce.  The place isn't cheap... ended up paying around $20 for just the burger and fries, but well worth it.  I can honestly say that the Miyagi burger was the best I've ever had, and the truffle fries are definitely no joke.  Definitely coming back to try their other items!!!  BACHI BURGER ROCKS!!",

However, there is a combination of different flavors that are nice on the palate.  I've tried a sampling of their menu - from loaded fries, to ramen soup, to burgers - the overall review is... Everything is a bit heavy on the salty side. Bacon jam is going to be salty, I get it. Use of cumin would be better than salt though. Their oxtail meat is super tender, however, I think they cook it with too much salt.  Let's point out the vegetarians. They're not really going to like Bachi Burger, as their aren't a lot of vegetarian options... Especially if you don't want soup. More variety would help bring in more clientele.  I'll go back. I do really like the oxtail fries.",

If you havent seen this place on the Food Network channel with Guy Fieri Diners, Drive Ins & Dives then you are missing out.  It is located off the strip so its not too busy, but when it does the wait is a little long and their waiting area is not equipped with a lot of chairs.  I love their pork belly sliders, the best ever. Its not on a regular bun its on a steamed bun omg the pork belly just melts on your toungue its soo good. Also try the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. Heaven literally an orgasm in your mouth and they top it off with a over easy egg. HEAVEN!   I ordered the Kalbi Burger Medium. OMG! Best burger they have and if you like Kimchee you're in LUCK! I usually add a overmedium egg on the burger and it tops it off. Babe usually gets something different or gets the Kalbi but this time she chose to get the Spicy Miso Burger which was really good. I think all their burgers are all good. They have really good flavors and what they pair them with its just perfect lol.  Their service sometimes suck when they're busy, takes them a while to come back to you. But the food really makes up for it.",

    "text": "If I were a cow and were to be slaughtered, I wish my delicious body would be brought here, for I know I would be taken care of with the utmost delicacy and cooked to perfection.  The way I discovered Bachi Burger was by my friends bringing me back a fifth of a burger while I was in vegas.  I was already full from eating at a buffet so I didn't go with them but when I tried their left overs, I took a mental note that I had to go back one day.  Fast forward 3 months later, I came here with Ellie, my brother, and his girlfriend and I was amazed at the taste of the burgers.  We went for a late lunch, around 4pm and we were seated immediately.  I must admit, the environment of the place was a little too dim for my taste and there was quite a bit of a smokey atmosphere but I'll try not to sweat the small stuff.    Our group ORDERED OXTAIL FRIES, a SHOGUN BURGER, and BBQ BACON BURGER.    The taste was extraordinary to say the least.  I really enjoyed the oxtail fries which was about $12. The entire group split it and my only wish was that there was more meat.  My lady ordered the shogun burger which was a hefty $25 but it included what I believe was unagi.  She split half of her burger with another but she said it was well worth it.  As for me, my BBQ BACON burger was exquisite.  I loved the bread and the meat was cooked perfectly.  It was tender, juicy, delicious and well put together.  I wish I knew what kind of bread they used because it was perhaps the best burger bread I've ever had.  It reminds me of the bread from in n out which never crumbles while you eat it and it had a somewhat shiny, buttery texture. My burger COST about $15.  I'm not usually one to eat gourmet type burgers but this was well worth it.  For DESSERT, I ordered a strawberry tart with vanilla ice cream.  It was a solid dish but it didn't \"wow\" me like the burger did.  Next time I'll pass on it but all in all, I had a great experience.  This has my award for best burger (so far.)  You gotta go here!",

My original plan was not to write a review until I gave them another try but the more I think about our meal, the more I realize I wont be returning.  The room is loud and uncomfortable. There are tvs on the walls and we were seated under one of them. A  game was on. At any given time, a dozen people were starting at  the tv above us, which just feels weird while trying to eat and several times during our meal some jerk literally walked up to our table to stare into the tv. Way uncool.  We started with a couple apps. The basic edamame was perfect. The grilled shishito peppers were bland, needed salt and were skewered with little tomatoes which were good and a tough slice of fibrous mushroom.  We had 3 burgers. The black and green burger was mostly good but had a weird sweetness to it and too much vegetable on top. The same goes for the spicy miso burger. again mostly good but a weird sweetness and a awkward assembly - too much vegggie, topping. Also, I felt like I had to eat it fast to save the bun. The bun made it to the end, but was a dime thin  rubbery disc by the time I finished, and I ate it fast. the third burger, the kiki was just weird. the mushrooms were hard and chewy with a bad mouth feel, it was strange biting into it. Like the previous two, it had a weird sweetness. I didn't finish it. It was just odd tasting. All three burgers felt like unresolved experiments. All three felt  awkward, like a poor attempt at fusion cuisine, too far removed from the familiar burger world but not like any asian cuisine I've had. None of the three burgers tasted all that good and all just felt strange, too sweet, poorly assembled, out of balance.  We had a side of truffle fries which were served in a cone with a spicy aioli on the side. The fries on top were very good but all of the ones below were wet and soggy.  We had their recommended portuguese donuts. They were disappointing. Very dense and tough balls of dough rolled in too much sugar and cinnamon served with a bit of rock hard ice cream. I didn't like them at all. Any donut ball from any donut shop would have been a better pastry.",

The answer?  It's short for Hibachi and it makes total sense.    They were kind of busy so we waited about 10 min for a table which was a good thing since we could study the menu in detail.  By the time we were seated, I knew what I wanted to eat.    Food took a while because someone in our party wanted their burger \"well done!\" - Yuck!  But they made it like they wanted.  Our server (forgot her name but she's from Waianae) gave us great information about the doneness and what she liked.    Needless to say our plates were clean after it was all over.

They spent some time decorating it and trying to have good Feng Shui and I can appreciate that.   Ah, but the food.  It was AWFUL.  I can't remember the last time the food was SO bad.    Unfortunately I can't remember the name of the burger I got but it was purple.  Yes, purple.  I actually thought it was pretty cool until I took a bite.  The flavor, the texture, everything about it, was just awful.  I literally couldn't force myself to take another bite.    Some of you out there may like it but I will never, I repeat, NEVER eat there again.",

    "text": "I went a few weeks ago with some friends . Only reason I am going with 3 stars is they had really good burgers , loved the fries but my burger was not so hot. Otherwise it would have gotten a 4 or 5 star. I got the Kiki burger . We were told the chef prefers medium which I went yay its what I prefer. So I got mine medium and the guys got theirs medium rare and medium. Let me warn you. Medium is not or at least for the person cooking that night a light pink. It was a lot closer to medium rare. Almost redish pink all the way through. I couldn't wait to try it since I adore mushrooms and a good mushroom burger. Its one of my favorite three things in the world to eat. My friend ate here all the time and just raved about it so I figured it had to be good.   When I cut the burger in half to start eating it I took a bite and went omg I can't eat it, it tastes almost raw. We called the server over told them it was to rare and found out that's what was considered medium here. So I asked for a medium well. While the guys ate their burgers. (both graciously offered to wait for mine to be made which I said no eat) I munched on the fries we ordered. Sweet potato fries probably one of the two best I have ever had. Yummy dipping sauce, crunchy on the outside and creamy middle. The truffle fries .... all I can say is so good and addictive. Salt and Pepper ate one but had to stop due to the peppers on it. :(    After a few minutes my burger came back out and much to my shock it was the same burger cut in half with a bite missing where I had taken a bite. Not wanting to cause issues I shrugged and ate it. Now i am sure had it not been cut in half it would have been wonderful (and less icky thinking of it going back on the grill and back onto my plate) not just good. Anyone who cooks knows you can't cut open a piece of meat and re-grill it without losing most of it juiciness. My friend had the Mister Ho and the other had the Miyagisan. Both looked really good and had rave reviews from them. I will end up going back to try once more. Hoping it is better next time.",

Based on the menu and prices, I expected great food, above average service. Between each course I ordered, the waitress took the dirty fork and knife and placed it on the table...nice mustard stains...I cleaned the mess for her as she was oblivious.     The people next to my table sent a burger back two times before it was medium well as requested by the lady.  They asked for a manager...while apologetic, she said the staff should do this, that, whatever, apologized again, said the staff really should have done better, but it seems to happen,  Sorry.  Come back again.   I had to ask three times for the waitress to bring a glass for a beer.  The bill was dropped off before the dessert arrived, three people hovered six times to see if the bill was signed while eating dessert.  I spent $45 + tip for one person and did not receive anything beyond Denny's level of service.    The Portuguese donuts were very good...the only thing I tried that was up to par.  Great concept, lousy staff training and execution.  A seriously poor execution...and the place was at about 20% capacity, plenty of staff awaiting a dinner rush....they should be in a training refresher meeting  before the rush hit.  I wanted to like it.  Three stars is really 2.5.",

He also kept calling me by another name even after I corrected him a few times. I asked for my Miyagi-san burger to be cooked medium, but it was medium rare. Since we were in a hurry, I just ate it anyway, but too red for my liking. I liked the fried egg and furikake that came with it, and normally I love fried onions on my burger too, but for some reason, it felt like too much. I have to say though, the truffle oil fries were pretty delicious. And the sweet potato ones were not bad either. Our waitress was good, but not outstanding. I'm sure if I came back at a less busy time, it would have been more enjoyable, but 3 stars for now.",

    "text": "First restaurant stop during my most recent visit through the Las Vegas area. Plenty of lot parking for this place that has been featured on DDD. Fairly close to airport.  We were greeted and seated shortly upon entering. Food and beverage orders for the five of us was taken relatively timely. Food delivery, refills, and check settlement were decent with time from Anna.   Between the five of us we ordered the oxtail chili fries, pork belly steamed bao sandwich, ronin burger, lonely bird and miyagi san burger. Burgers are cooked to the temperate requested. For our table from medium rare to medium.  Oxtail fries reminded us of chili cheese fries substituted ground beef with oxtail. It was not over saucy, balance of sweet and savory.   Pork belly steamed bun sandwiches. The duroc pork belly, slaw, egg, and hoisin bbq sauce. Smaller dishes. Tender pork belly. Not as fatty as I like. Not overly sauce. The blend of ingredients sound odd but worked.   Ronin burger filled with beef, sweet onion marmalade, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, and a side of yuzu citrus aioli. The onion marmalade gave a good sweetness balance to the savory texture of slaw and egg. The citrus aioli was one of the better sauces we tried between the dishes. Elements separated were all good. Aspects of the dish together were harmonious.   The lonely bird burger made of ground chicken & turkey \"tsukune\" burger with herb pesto, lettuce, tomato, and brown ale battered onion rings. One of the non beef burgers. Plenty of produce. Large stack of onion rings. The chicken turkey blend was not bad. I was not particular fan of it. It was moist but I wasn't feeling it.   Miyagi San burger made of wagyu beef, chili mayo, fried egg, furikake caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings. This was a nice burger. Meat was seasoned, juicy. Got the Asian fusion vibe. The accompaniments were crispy and sweet from the bacon and the onion rings. The sauce was okay.  Overall good experience. Asian fusion written all over. Would visit again.",

The restaurant is spacious and casual.  In the front, there is a leather couch, a table with menus, and a small chalkboard listing their specials.  ::Drinks:: I got the Iced Matcha Green Tea. It was not sweet and I couldn't taste the green tea flavor; it was watered down.  ::Food:: We got the Black and Green Burger which came with American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, sauteed mushrooms, bacon, spinach, blue cheese, and roasted garlic.  I also requested to add Fried Egg.  What I liked most about this burger was the bun, it was fluffy, toasted, and sweet.  Next is the KiKi's Burger.  It had Angus Beef, caramelized bacon, cheese, sweet onion marmalade, garlic chili aioli, and three kinds of mushroom, Shiitake, Enoki, and Eryngii.  I prefer this burger than the Black and Green Burger.  If I come back, I will try something different and I also want to get the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.

I ordered mine the only way a burger should be done (medium rare, DUH) and it came out perfect. The beef was juicy, unagi was sweet, while the foie gras was decadent. It got messy and all over the place, probably why there's always a line for the bathroom. My friend even warned me that I should sit closer to the table when our food came. Sound advice.   The parmesan truffle sweet potato fries were good, but not amazing. I am just a sucker for sweet potato fries.   There was no wait for us when we arrived. It was a Sunday during lunch, but then again it was just 2 of us and we had no problems with sitting at the bar. Service was top notch, (although there was a slight sexist incident.. I was dining with a pescetarian so obviously he had a fish burger. When our food came, the runner gave ME the fish burger and the shogun to my friend. I said \"other way around\" and he said \"oh I just assumed the shogun was his because it's meaty and manly. EXCUSE ME!? *rolleyes I digress)  and I would definitely wander off the strip for a Shogun burger again.",

The Kiki burger did not have much caramelized onions, which was the flavor I was craving for.  The Miyagi-san burger was delicious.  My favorite part of that burger was the fried onion rings.  Overall this place has great service and good food, I would recommend eating here.",

    "text": "Bachi Burger used to be my favourite restaurant. I came here for my birthdays, prom, etc. I was particularly fond of their \"No Meat Here\" burger, and always made a point to get it at least once when I came back to Vegas during my visits from college.  However, the last two times I visited Bachi have been rather negative. In January of this year, my grandma and I waited 45 minutes for a seat that we were looking at the entire time we were waiting. No one was sitting there, and it was already clean, yet we weren't seated. When we were, however, I found out they didn't have the ingredients for the burger I go there for, so I ordered the same thing as my grandma-- some fried rice. Not only did it take ages for us to get our fried rice, but for some reason, my grandma's plate didn't come out until 20 minutes after mine. We got the same dish.   Then we tried again today, myself, my uncle, and my grandma. My uncle needed to get soup because he got his wisdom teeth pulled, and they weren't preparing soup. Apparently that side of the restaurant was closed during lunch hour. Also the bathroom was broken.  Bachi used to be a hidden gem on my side of town I loved going to with my family and friends, but it's been in such a decline these past couple of years. It's sad. I had a lot of good memories here. I hope they take these local reviews into consideration so they don't lose all their local customer loyalty. Unfortunately, they've lost mine.",

    "text": "Horrible service Very disappointed  We were the first guests to arrive at 11am. We were promptly seated. There were three of us. My husband and I ordered burgers with oxtail chili fries and my mother ordered ramen with a side of rice. Our fries came out in 5 minutes. Our burgers came out maybe 10-15 minutes later. But my moms ramen and side of rice order still haven't come out. We were done with our burgers after 10 minutes and still the ramen haven't come out. The female server said it was coming out. Another 8 minutes pass and finally the ramen finally arrives but the side rice still not on the table.  Another 5 minutes or so pass and my mom ask for rice since she likes to eat ramen with rice. The assistant supervisor comes by to finally drop off the rice after almost 10 minutes of asking for it with no apology for the delay and walks off. My mom is so upset that she barely touched her meal. I ask to speak with a manager and she returns. My mom expresses her anger about the horrible service and she talks over my mom and tells us that the rice was not cooked or the ramen. There are two different kitchens. One for the ramen side and the other for the burger side. She also had a defensive attitude. My mom told her that she didn't like the ramen and do not want to be charge for it or the rice. So she quickly grabs the rice & ramen and walks away. Still no apology. I was very disappointed with how she handled the situation.   An excellent guest recovery for what happen would be for her to have automatically remove the rice & ramen off the bill and offer to comp the entire meal which included the two burgers & fries since our food did not come out at the same time; and they forget to cook the ramen & rice. We had to ask her to remove the ramen & rice off the bill. An apology as well would have eased the situation. It was obvious that they forget to make the ramen & rice. It was a very disappointing dining  experience. The burgers and fries are definitely good but the restaurant lacks management empathy & sincerity. Very very disappointed and will not return because of the very poor treatment that we received.",

    "text": "When I found out that Bachi Burger had a $25 Shogun burger, it was so sinfully delicious sounding, that I had to have it first thing once we arrived in Sin City.  Having arrived at almost closing, around 10pm, we were no longer allowed to eat at the restaurant, so I ordered my $25 Wagyu and foie gras burger to go.  The AC was broken on this particular night, as was the bathroom.  As soon as you set foot inside, we started sweating as if we were in a sauna.  I waited for my order to come out.  Once it came out, I took it out of the box to take pictures.  I said to myself, I might as well scarf this thing down; and so I did.  I don't know if it was because I was sweating while eating the the burger, or because I was being rushed, or because it was in a to go box, or whatever it was, it was a bit overrated.  It was good, but when eating a delicacy, you probably need to eat this thing on a plate, and eat it slowly to enjoy and savor the flavors ingredients.  The bread was great (mildly sweet with a glaze), the meat, well it is Wagyu and of course better quality, and the foie gras was nice, jello'y and fatty.  A small bed of lettuce gave it a bit of crunch and healthiness.  I've also had a fish sandwich here on another occasion.  That time I was severely dehydrated and so it got in the way of my enjoyment and being a connoisseur.  Next time will have to eat here in normal conditions/circumstances.",

    "text": "We've gone to Bachi Burger twice now with each visit we've made to Las Vegas.  It's an interesting menu, as the burgers are asian inspired and if memory serves, share a combination of savory and sweet in some form or another.  The first time I ate here last year, I tried a burger off the menu.  The beef was very tasty and the quality and freshness was undeniable.  Would I have made a burger like this at my place?  No.  The second time I ate here, which was last week, I requested a \"regular\" burger which wasn't on the menu because I wasn't feeling like having savory and sweet, and they obliged.  Again, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The food does take awhile to come out, especially if you're in a large party, so don't expect anything \"express\" style.  It's an enjoyable enough place if you don't mind the wait.  They're usually very busy.  If you're hankering for a more traditional burger, they'll hook you up with a smile.   No complaints about this establishment.  It's in the \"take it or leave it\" category for me.",

Set up was casual with TV screens everywhere, as typical with other burger joints. Bar in the middle that serves alcohol,  BOBA teas and fruit juices.  Adjacent and connected to a ramen place. Pretty  gnarly that both menus were presented (most likely same owners) and they welcomed ordering from either menu. A burger and some ramen??? Sweet!!  THE FOOD GIST:  The OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES were quite EYE CATCHING. Our friends posted a pix on facebook and I drooled just looking at it. Bookmarked it instantly.  How can you sit next to someone who ordered this dish and NOT want to have a bite?  This is a MUST HAVE for that very reason.   Overall, this dish was heavy and was a meal in itself. It was loaded with \"pulled\" oxtail, chili, cheese and topped w/ an oozing fried egg....CRAZEE!!  The fries were just the right size and everything went well together. Loved the garlic aioli!!  SHOGUN BURGER:  Hats off to Bachi Burger for creating a pretty magnificent burger.  The medley of ingredients are standing O worthy and complement each other well.  Check it out:  wagyu beef & unagi. pan seared FOIE GRAS, poached asian pear, miso butter and yamamomo peach. A hint of sweet and savory with every bite. BEST GOURMET BURGER in my eyes.  I recommend DECONSTRUCTING it with foie gras on the side.  I would take a bite of the burger, then a bite of foie gras. YUM-O!. I could've  also done w/o the patty since I'm not a big meat person and it was a bit too heavy.    I was feeling guilty and had to get a HOUSE SALAD: No bueno. It was blah. Dressing was lacking and greens were a bit too bitter for me. Not an arugula fan.   STRAWBERRY LYCHEE LEMONADE:  The waitress was so sweet and patient with me.  It took me forever and a day to decide on a drink.  I was back and forth between a boba tea and soda.  She assured me that this drink was really good and I went for it.  It was refreshing and made w/ fresh strawberries.  Lychee flavor was very mild though.   SERVICE: Friendly service and food came out at an average pace.   TID BIT:  1) Outdoor seating available 2) Kid friendly.  3) Only 1 public bathroom. Long wait time :(  The hubs and I really enjoyed our experience.  We sat their eating away and were at one with our food.  Will surely be back to try other burgers.",

The brussel sprouts were delicious and probably my favorite part of the meal.  The bacon and pear had such a great crunch and provided a nice salty/sweet aspect, plus the sauce was the bomb.  I was going to order the shogun burger but they were out of foie so I went with the miyagi-san's which was also quite tasty.  The truffle fries were ok, I could have gone with something else and the mushroom sauce wasn't for me, it was a little floraly and sweet.  My only problem with the restaurant is that service is pretty slow and I can't imagine what it's like when it's busier so I definitely recommend ordering an appetizer, which came out pretty fast, so you don't get hangry.",

Some people were currently eating, not sure how that went for them. Seems like they were trying to quickly and quietly get people out before health department made an announcement. I know restaurants have violations from time to time but I'd there is no hot water early in the day when there are very few customers, you should know it's unacceptable to serve food. Not hot enough to wash dishes or even hands!  ** they lied. They were on dirty dining a week later and were shut down for a week due to the massive roach infestation. Nasty.",

    "text": "Prologue: My girlfriend and I like to stay at an RV park on the south end of the Strip, which is right down the street from this restaurant. We usually arrive in town right around supper time, so this place made perfect sense as our first stop for some nourishment after a long drive up from Tucson.   The Plot: We started by sharing some Peking Style Duck Steamed (Bao, a.k.a. Fold-Over) Buns followed by a Kiki's Burger cooked medium.  The Scene: The portion sizes were good and just right for the two of us.  The buns were tasty with a nice combination of flavors and textures and all of the ingredients complimented each other very well.  The burger was perfectly prepared with a nice crust on the outside, cooked evenly throughout, tender, juicy, and had great flavor. The bacon and caramelized onions were also cooked perfectly, very tasty, and enhanced the flavor of the meat quite nicely.   The Rest of the Story: I appreciate that the fact that poultry is much more flavorful when served slightly under done. However, the duck meat in one of the buns was rather chewy and probably should have been cooked more thoroughly. I would have also expected more crispy skin in a dish called Peking Style Duck.  We thought the amount of greens served in the burger was a bit too generous. There are better ways to make a burger sandwich look tall when serving. For example, we expected the portion of meat in a specialty burger to be bigger and thicker than it was, especially when you consider that this sandwich was served with no side dishes.  Epilogue: The service was prompt and courteous; however it was somewhat overbearing. We ended up having to tell three different wait staff a total of four times that we were still working on our meal and not yet ready to have our plates cleared away.  Although we expect the prices at restaurants in Las Vegas to be higher than in Tucson, we still thought that this restaurant was somewhat overpriced considering it's off the Strip and caters to mostly locals.

    "text": "I like Bachi Burger - and was a pretty big fan at one time. But I'm just not as impressed these days.  Most recently, I tried the \"No Meat Here\" vegetarian burger. It was a good attempt to make an interesting sandwich. Sadly, the burger itself was just not that good. Too dense and bean-y for my taste. All of the other additions to the burger - no matter how creative - won't save it if the main 'burger' is not great.  My date had the steamed pork buns, which he didn't finish. \"Just not that interesting\" was his take.  We shared the Truffle Parmesan Fries - and these were actually disappointing. Almost no Parmesan that we could see or taste. The Truffle Porcini Cream had a generally mushroomy taste, but only the slightest whiff of truffle - and there was only a drizzle of the sauce on the whole order of fries. Basically, it was just 'fries' with a garnish of sauce. I'd like to see a good deal more cheese, and wouldn't mind the sauce being served on the side - if messy finger food is a problem. But please use more truffle if you are going to advertise it as such. I will go out of my way for good truffle fries.  I have had excellent food here.  Just not recently.",

    "text": "The food is absolutely fantastic. It's so fantastic that by the time I leave the restaurant after giving this place yet another chance, I think that maybe it's worth all of the issues. But.. after multiple visits over the past three years. It's just not worth it.  The fact is that this is the worst managed restaurant on the planet, and the food is just so outstandingly good that it somehow scrapes by.  Come into this place and be prepared to wait. There's always a waiting list. However, it's artificial. Look past the list and you'll see a restaurant with multiple empty tables and a complete bar counter that isn't sat. Management refuses to properly staff the restaurant.  Every now and then, you'll finally be sat at one of the multitude of empty tables. Don't get your hopes up because management hasn't staffed the kitchen either. Be prepared to wait for a very long time.   It's okay though. Look at the menu. This place has a decent selection of draft beers and an impressive list of bottled beers. The long wait won't seem so long as you partake of some drinks. Hell, the restaurant and the wait staff wins cause it's free up selling. Except, management won't stock the bar. The list of 5 draft beers? They only actually have one of those. They're out of the rest. This place is literally throwing away free money.   These are not one time experiences. I searched through my credit card history, and I've spent over $1500 here in 2016. I'm scared to look at the other years. I've been here multiple times and two things are consistent: the food is outstanding and this is the most mismanaged mess of a restaurant on the planet. And it has been that way for years. Just imagine how shitty this place has been managed that the amazing food just can't save it anymore.   Ha, there was this one time where I ordered Ramen, and this place ran out of chopsticks. Chopsticks. I can't wrap my head around how that is even possible. How do you run out of an eating utensil? It's the most absurd thing ever.",

It's honestly not that spicy but has a small kick that brings a great flavor with the rest of the sauce, fried egg and shishito peppers up in there.

    "text": "One of my favorite culinary movements that's finally penetrating non-coastal cities here in the U.S. is proper Asian-American fusion, and for that reason I really wanted to fall in love with Bachi Burger. The menu was spot on, but the product delivery fell just a tad bit short of what I've had elsewhere.  Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  No complaints about the service at Bachi. Service was fast and friendly, and while I was ever so slightly irked that I couldn't order just a single pork bun to try it with my burger (instead had to order three and later hate myself) everything came together. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  As I've now harked on at length, $15.00 is my cap on a sit down burger spot with very few exceptions. Bachi must feel the same way, as their most expensive burger the Miyagi-San comes in right at $15.00. The burger isn't quite as large as the oversized bun and the even more oversized onion rings allude to, but it's by no means a rip off.   From there, my three (small) duck pork buns were $12.00, or $4.00 each, which also wasn't a deal nor a ripoff. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Honestly both of my dishes at Bachi Burger were just okay -  I started with the Duck Pork Buns, which, while obviously freshly prepared and with good ingredient proportions, didn't have a ton of flavor. The cabbage and carrots and egg downplayed the duck a bit to the point where the accompanying sauce was needed, and the bao was ever so slightly sticky, which can happen if they sit out for two long.   The burger was a similar story. The absurdly large bun was unnecessary apart from optics, and while I like the onion rings I did end up picking two of them off so that I could actually taste the burger patty, which was decent but not packed with it's own inherent flavor. The cheese and egg paired nicely, but all in all this was just a good burger - not a great one. Single Star Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Vegas these days is so stacked on Asian and burgers alike that I can't say that i would. No Star Granted.",

The music is very local and the people are very welcoming. We came during lunch & looked like there were many tables available but the wait was 15 minutes. I didn't realize this place was also a ramen joint so my boyfriend ordered a burger & I got the spicy miso ramen. We also ordered the oxtail fries. The wait wasn't too bad either. They let you know that the burgers & ramen come out of separate kitchens so it will come out in variations.  My ramen was tasty & had a flavorful tamago in it! The burger & the fries were huge! We could not finish even half of it but all the food was great. Service was superb, Our waters were constantly refilled. Next time I'm in town, I will definitely get a burger for myself!",

I used to be obsessed with hamburgers and have tried them in many ways, shapes and forms all over the world.  Although there are many interpretations of \"The Hamburger\", typically, they all either tasted very similar, or very bad.  Bachi is the exception.   It is my opinion that the Wagu Bachi Burger with cheese, double patty, is the greatest \"crossover-hamburger\" of all times.   There are a lot of other great, and unique items on the menu, however, I would come just for the Burger. Furthermore, I would not diverge from the \"The Standard Burger\" on your first visit. They have all sorts of unique versions, however, trust me - just ask for the wagu with cheese and maybe a side of mayo.   Yes, they are a little slow. So? It's worth it.   Easy parking. Very nice staff. A fabled ramen bar in the back that may or may not ever open - but who cares?   This review is all about THE BURGER.   Japanese sweet yet grilled smokey heaven.  And yes, I feel awful for eating cows...But I was a vegetarian for many years and all it got me was sick, tired and longing for a burger...a Bachi burger!  Hurry , go now!!!",

Once upon a time, this place was standing room only and understandably so.   Tonight, it was suspiciously slow. And understandably so.

We ordered:  Miyagi-San burger:  This was pretty good! It has bacon, fried egg, onion rings, chili mayo and furikake (which is apparently a seasoning..thanks, Google).  After staring at pictures, this is one of the burgers you must try.  Ronin burger:  This burger has Japanese cole slaw in it which I've noticed was just added slices of that red ginger you get when you eat at Japanese restaurants.  There's also caramelized onions, fried egg, yuzu citrus aioli, katsu bbq and miso goma dressing.  I've only tried this and the previously mentioned burger but this one was my favorite.  Actually, we both liked this one the best.  If you're generally not a fan of ginger (like moi), you will hardly taste it and you'll survive.  Salt & Pepper Garlic fries:  I asked for recommendations on the fries and was told to get this one since it was the waitress's favorite.  It has jalapeno, sea salt/pepper and surprisingly more ginger than I was expecting, which didn't make it that great for me.  Get this if you are, again, a fan of ginger.  We couldn't really taste anything garlicky about the fries (and the sauce as well), but more of the jalapeno.  It comes with an amazing garlic chili aioli sauce.  Truffle Parmesan fries:  We really liked this one the best (compared to the other fries).  There's black truffle porcini cream on the fries along with a sun dried tomato aioli.  I think we liked these fries mixed with the garlic chili aioli  together.  Milk tea drinks:  These were THE most bland drinks we have ever had with its non-sweet flavors (honeydew and lychee) and too soft tapiocas.    For drinks, I was told that they do make their own beverages and I did see this one soda that seemed appealing (apple and lychee).  Other than that, we look forward to our next Vegas trip and we'll definitely be back!",

I ordered a medium rare Ronin Burger and it was made just right.  I would recommend this Restuarant if you want a well, unique and one of a kind type of burger here in Las Vegas.",

This was Salty, with just enough heat to give you a thirst for a nice cold beer. They have several great beers on tap. Fortunately the y had a beer on tap that I recently had at Hakassan. Hitachino Nest Beer White Ale. I then Had the Rhonin Burger.  Angus Beef  Caramelized Onions  Japanese  Cole Slaw  Miso Goma Dressing  Fried Egg  Katsu BBQ  Yuzu Citrus Aioli.  I added aged Cheddar for an added bite. Cooked a perfect medium rare as I like it. You need to cut in half to start the egg just oozes down the burger making your taste buds yearn for that perfect bite. It was a perfect bite. I will with out a doubt eat  here again. The service was excellent and attentive, and you know how I feel about that. Prices are moderate. I will say this joint is jumping at lunch time and the staff handled it well. Good place for group lunches. If you get a chance go check this out if you have not. You will not be disappointed.",

I didn't care much for the dipping sauce and thought it didn't need it. I ordered the fried rice for my youngest. He liked it but thought it wAs a little spicy. I ordered the pork rice ball. He enjoyed that a lot.  My husband ordered the MiYagi with fried onion rings, egg, garlic aioli served on a soft bun. He thought that it was great. My older son ordered the tonkatsu ramen and he slurped that right up. We ended our night with the chocolate cake and caramel salt milk shake. Both were ok. I thought that the cake would ooze out a bit but no luck.  I los ordered the plantation ice tea and had them add boba. Got my boba fix after all. I would recommend you give this a try.",

    "text": "A little disappointed. While the creative parings and toppings were high quality and tasty the taste of the meat in the burger was a bit lacking.  We ordered the sausage app, the sausages were tasty, served with a nice whole grain mustard. They were just sausages really, nothing special. We also had the chili chicken, that was pretty tasty.  I had the Spicy Miso burger and it was spicy! My sinuses started to clear just from smelling it but not too hot to bear. It was tasty but again I was disappointed with the flavor if the meat itself. The meat was a bit bland, hard and dry. I got the impression that it was a frozen wagyu patty. So while the overall burger was good, it was more like I had all these tasty toppings, sauce and spices wrapped around a bland burger.   I give Bachi props for the unique creation of an Asian/Burger fusion and the creative tastes but in the end an inferior or frozen beef patty will bring a good burger down and ultimately why I couldn't give them 4 stars.  One tip if you get one of the burgers with a fried egg, be careful with the over medium egg..... Bite the wrong way and you could have a blast of hot liquid yolk shoot all over you! LOL",

Everything sounded absolutely delicious. I wish I had a slider of each them. I ended up getting the kiki's burger and it was just what I expected. All the ingredients (garlic chili aioli, gruyere, all the Asian mushrooms, sweet onion marmalade, caramelized bacon) came together really well on top of the angus beef patty. Although I gravitate to simpler burgers (i.e. Father's Office Burger in LA), this burger was just a burst of flavor. It was inventive and delicious.  Now for my favorite part of the meal: the oxtail chili cheese fries. After my first bite, I seriously exclaimed: HOLY CRAP WHAT IS THIS. It was insanely delicious to me. The fries were incredibly crispy, and the oxtail with the chili was just superb. Topped with cheese and a fried egg, damn. It just doesn't get better than this. I would never think to put oxtail on chili cheese fries, but props to the people who figured this out.  Every time I come to Vegas, this is where I'm going to want to eat.",

They were both awesome - even my son's burger was surprisingly good for a kids' burger! My son scarfed his whole burger, and he is usually a slow eater. The truffle fries were great with the mushroom sauce and sun dried tomato aoli. The spiked milkshake was good too, a little strong, but who would complain about that?! What's not to love about grass-fed wagyu beef, funakoke seasoning, Vietnamese mint... It was a blend of happy ingredients having a party in my mouth.",

    "text": "Amazing burgers!  I love this place!  It was recommended by several friends, so I came here with my family, and it is possibly one of the best local burger joints in town.  Not to mention the homemade sodas.  Mmmmm!  We pigged out and order the kiki, fish, and kalbi burger along with sweet potato fries, truffle fries, Peking duck rolls, and finished off with Portuguese doughnuts.  The short review: Get the fish burger, sweet potato fries, and a Cherry Yuzu soda.  The fish is rich and just as good as a beef burger.  The sweetness in the fries pair off really well with the bitterness of the Cherry Yuzu.  The longer review:  The kalbi burger is really good, but also really sweet.  The first bites are tasty, but then my tongue got a little sick of the sweet meat.  Surprisingly, the kimchi on the burger wasn't overpowering.  The truffle fries are cooked just as well as the sweet potato fries: crispy yet fluffy.  The truffle gave it a richness that contrasted with the Parmesan shavings.  But, the truffle is only at the top, so everything under the first layer are regular fries.  I wasn't too big on the doughnuts only because I am not a fan of cinnamon, and the accompanying ice cream for the doughnuts were loaded with cinnamon flecks.  Loaded!    The atmosphere is really hipster.  The servers are young and relaxed.  The decoration is modern with an Asian theme, but still reminds me of a local coffee shop in Seattle.      Overall, the food focuses on contrasting flavors that complement which was done really well.  The quality is very high, and the atmosphere is awesome.",

Everything was great until I noticed some yelling like talk coming from the kitchen. It was a female and she was not sounding nice. I couldn't really tell cuz I wasn't trying hard to not stare but she seemed to be a shorter Hawaiian chef that didn't seem to be happy. I don't know why she was so mad , she makes great food why the anger? If I wanted to eat with anger I would go to my dad's :).

    "text": "So, recently I got a message from someone that works at Bachi Burger, I don't know if it was the owner, but they agreed with me that the restaurant was indeed too stinky from the egg smell, and actually hired repairmen to fix the problem and encouraged me to come and try them out again.  After I told my husband to \"suck it, I told you so,\" about the egg smell we decided to come and try Bachi Burger for dinner.  They were right, there was a huge improvement on the smell.  When it comes to eggs, my nose is like a shark.  I can smell eggs like they can smell blood from miles away.  While the smell wasn't 100% gone, it was at an acceptable level that didn't bowl me over as it did the first time here.  And overall the food and the service was really excellent.  I wanted to try some different things so I got the only salad on their menu, a mini chop salad, which was fresh and delicious.  My only complaint is that they don't have a huge variety of salads, but what they do have is delicious.  We also tasted the pork belly buns which were phenomenal, as was the lonely bird burger I had.  Normally I would try to stay on the beef path on a burger place, but seeing that Rick Moonen had enjoyed this sandwich, I wanted to give it a shot.  I am not a fan of chicken burgers but this was flavorful and great.  My advice, if you have complained about Bachi Burger in the past, and you happen to be somewhat near to the area, I would give them a second try.  They are definitely going to be on my regular rotation for restaurants.",

The ketchup was very good, we thought it tasted even better inside the burger. The burger was different yet unique like I said before, but it definitely was not worth what we had paid for. Our bill came out to be almost $40 with just the order of two burgers and fries & all we drank was water.. Probably won't ever go back to another Bachi Burger to spend that much on just two burgers.",

It comes with approximately 8 different types of pickles (radishes, garlic, etc.), all of which are deliciously different.  The edamame with garlic, ginger and chili are positively addictive. This was the first place I'd ever had edamame stir-fried with seasonings. I thought it was a great idea and have been experimenting with different flavor combinations at home.  We've tried the garlic salt and pepper fries and the truffle Parmesan fries. Both were delish!  The Peking duck steamed buns are very good and have a nice, sweet sauce.  We've tried the Kiki's, Bahn-Mi, and Kalbi burgers. All were perfect fusion burgers. Very unique but made perfect sense when you ate them.  The only bad thing is Bachi Burger is on the other side of town from me. Love the place!",

    "text": "During my recent business trip to Vegas, Bachi Burger was BY FAR the best meal that I enjoyed!  Arriving during the prime dinner period, my friend and I immediately noticed the good amount of people waiting to be seated.  Note: they do not take reservations.  Our party of 2 put our name in and sat down, fully expecting to wait the 30 minutes that we were told by the hostess.  Shockingly, within 5 minutes we were called up and seated; sometimes being just a party of 2 helps a lot!  I ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger, which came topped with chili mayo, a fried egg, furikake,  caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings, as well as their salt & pepper garlic French fries, with a side of pineapple ketchup.  From the first delectable bite to the last, this meal was fantastic.  The burger was prepared perfectly and every bite was FULL (FULL!) of flavor.  The fries were great and the pineapple ketchup was sublime.  I enjoyed three burgers during this recent Vegas trip (Bachi, Fukuburger, and BurGR) and this meal was by far the best!  The two locations are off of the Strip, but do yourself a favor and go!",

Somethings missing, but i cant complain.

Where can you get a burger with kim chee or miso dressing on it?  Want a braised short rib sandwich in a bao bun?  Even Burger King won't make it this way!  I had the Kiki's burger.  I'm a bacon whore and this thing has caramelized bacon, so c'mon how could I even think about ordering something else?  I asked for it to be cooked med rare, which the waitress was more than happy to take note of.    When my bacon came out, it was delish!  It wasn't quite enough for my taste, but it was placed between (what looked at tasted like) sweet bread, some damn fine shrooms and  a thick, juicy patty.  Other than more bacon, I would have liked a more flavorful cheese (or maybe just a bit more) and for the meat to be cooked less.  It was more pink than red, but it was still tasty.  Aside from my bacon burger, we had sweet potato fries (awesomely crisp on the outside and tender throughout) and truffle fries (quite ordinary and plain, IMHO).  I also had an iced green tea, which was really dark and dense (the way I make it at home) compared to most other places I've had it.    Overall, the food was good.  Not mind blowing, but definitely a departure from your typical neighborhood burger joint.",

We wanted a decent meal before our trip back home to SD; so off to Bachi we were.   It's a little off the strip but way worth the drive! We ordered the Ronin and the Kiki burger and just ONE order of the truffle fries. We both split our burgers so we could kind of have our own sampler plate. The Kiki was bomb, but the Ronin was better! Wanna know what was better than the Ronin? THEIR TRUFFLE FRIES! We had to order a second order they were so damn good! This is going to be a frequent stop for us on our many trips to Vegas!",

I tried the KIKI BURGER and it had sauteed shitake, enoki and eryngi mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese and topped off with garlic chili aioli! The burger was fabulous! And as I looked around at my friends, they had the same \"mmmmm\" feeling.  Funny enough -- of the six people there, 4 had the KIKI burger, 1 had the Kalbi Burger (w/ Kim Chee), and another was adventurous and made her own burger with Wagyu Beef, fried egg and bacon!  Unless I am mistaken, most burgers are made with Angus beef or  Wagyu ... and there is a bit of sweet flavor to it!   Watch out Carl's Jr because if this is in your town, I will definitely pay up for Bachi's Specialty burgers at $8.50  than your Angus burger at $6!  If you're going to have a burger, you have to order fries with that, right? Right! So, add the sweet potato and/or truffle parmesean fries to your order!  So if you can find your way here, definitely go - hope you enjoy your meal as much as I did!",

The last few times I have ordered burgers the buns have been stale and hard. The first time I overlooked it. Things happen. Tonight I ordered the Crusty Crab burgers to go. I waited for them to be prepared then took them home. I live less than five minutes away. Once again the buns were stale and hard. This time I called to complain. The manager on duty said the buns were fine. He offered to replace the buns.. Not remake the sandwiches. That was a horrible remedy for a bed situation. I will never go back again. What a shame!!",

We ordered the pork dumplings, the chili fried chicken, the sausages, and their Parmesan fries. All were hot and lived up to the hype. We ordered the wagyu burger medium and received it overly well done. At this point we had a long day and were over the experience. Ashley didn't check back on the food till we all finished. Gave us our checks and didn't even thank us when she picked up our credit card receipts. One person at our table also had an over cooked burger but the one who had the pork belly steamed buns said his food was amazing. Left hungry and dissatisfied.  I was shocked of how terrible Ashley was. Spent $40+ a head for that? I think not again",

We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, tantanmen ramen, spicy miso ramen and spicy miso burger. There was a mix up in the ramen orders and the waitresses that brought them out were very rude about it. I'm all about service and I was pretty shocked to get an attitude from them, especially when the mistake was on their end. No apology or anything. The food was so delicious though that we just brushed it off. You must order the chili cheese fries. It was sweet and savory. I wish there was more oxtail on it though. I had the spicy miso ramen. The broth was very rich and flavorful. It can get quite pricey with the add ons. It comes with chasu pork. The meat literally melts in your mouth. I had my fair share of ramen around Orange County and their pork beats them all. The noodles were cooked to perfection. It had the right amount of chewiness. Overall the food was great. I would definitely come back the next time I am in town but I hope for better service.",

There was an abundance of seats so I wasn't concerned with the wait. We had prompted several servers numerous times with no acknowledgment. We then approached the server with the hope of getting seated. They seemed completely oblivious to our presence. I would have liked to have tried their burgers especially after reading all the great reviews. Unfortunately they failed miserably. I would like to have given them the benefit of the doubt but there was simply no excuse for the lack of service.",

Its like a Japanese Hawaiin infused burger place with a fun menu that is just oozing with creative takes on burger restaurant staples. The service is amazing (thanks Lantz) as well. They are very attentive and know their menu inside and out. If you go make sure to try the Wagyu burger, get an extra patty, some bacon,  throw a fried egg on it and add some shishito peppers wash it down with Morimoto Soba ale then get the pop tart with plum ice cream for dessert. You will cry.",

First of all, the music (like so many restaurants in this town) is so loud that you can't have a conversation with the company at your table.  Is this to cover up the Mexican families 5 little brats screaming or the weathered strippers puffed up boyfriend seated next to your table's homophobic rant about how 'he crushed that little f**'' ? Anyways the service is very poor from the tattooed waitress I had.  Certainly no training or even effort involved.  Bad attitude, although it did make me feel like I was back home in Portland.  She plopped down my undercooked $13 burger with no fries and left, never to be seen again until she plopped down my bill.  No thanks Bachi. I will never be back.",

The fries are crispy and not oily but I can hardly taste the oxtail in it. To me it tasted more like a regular chili cheese fries with some shredded meat. The Shogun is good IF you can finish it. I can only handle 1/2 of it. I love the Asian pear in it, somehow it makes me feel the burger is not as heavy and fruits make it healthier. My husband is not a burger eater so he ordered the ramen which is just average.",

    "text": "Bachi burger serves asian fusion burgers.   One word for this place: innovative.   That being because the different choices of burgers and sauces, etc all compliment eachother with all around goodness. No burger is the same. & they don't use the standard mustard and ketchup.   I always order the Ronin burger. Something about that combination of flavors keeps me comin back for more. Everytime I think of bachi, I think of that flavor! I've been conditioned to it! :)  The ronin burger contains Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, Katsu BBQ, miso goma dressing, and the yuzu citrus aioli. All in between two warm and soft hawaiian sweet roll buns. The beef was cooked to perfection - medium rare, just the way I like it.    The oxtail fries are a must try. They load up the plate with pulled oxtail meat with cheese, chili, and a fried egg. The fries were perfectly hot and crispy.   The Parmesan truffle fries are a great side as well! They too have that same crisp and hot (fresh from the fryer) texture and man oh man I love those esp with the side of sundried tomatoe aioli sauce. They also have ketchup on request AND pineapple ketchup if you want a kick!   I notice that they also have special seasonal items that are always changing and they are usually unique as well so keep your eyes peeled!!   Their beverage menu- again, unique and fun. They have different sake combinations as well as different types of beers. My bf really likes their Japanese white beer Hitachino Nest White Ale. I've tried and it and it makes a great pair with any of their burgers.",

What happened slowest service ever, hostess with major attitude and doesn't smile.    Last night I wanted to introduce my friend to bachi because I talk so highly about this place, major fail !  The guy host was kool he put our name down and said it was about a 45 min wait.  There was no room to sit so we walked across the street And set a timer on our phone to come back in 30 mins just incase we get called sooner.  While waiting I just looked up yelp reviews out of boredom and I read a one star review from a guy below, how they told him an hour and he came back earlier and they skipped over him and the hostess was super rude to him so he didn't even get to try the amazing food.  I thought it was unfortunate. Then same shit happened to us but we made the mistake of staying.   We came back in 30 mins instead of 45 and there was a gal at the host stand this time, we gave our names and she stated,  \" I called you guys and u weren't here so u have to be put on the end of the list, that's why I tell people to tell me you're leaving. Our cooks a falling behind today\"  Wtf woman u didn't tell us shit because u weren't the ones to put our name down.  The guy then came back n told her we were up next. Nice save dude and thank u.   They appeared short staff, our server Ratha super sweeetheart she gets 5 stars.   Food slowwwww I feel bad for the cooks the hostess said you are slow, but I still love the food so yum.   What killed it was the host chick, whatever you're going through leave it at home.  You're the first face people see when they walk in.   Reading more about past employees it makes sense, having a bad boss is like a cancer.    The food is still great but I'm hesitant to bring my friends here from out of state because of the service.  And that sucks because they really want to try bachi.  Maybe I'll just make the drive to the other location.  I think I will take them to Holsteins to be safe.  I now owe my friend a better dinner, and I should have listened to yelp.   Dear cooks your food rocks! I will miss your food:(",

It was pretty good, but the combination between hamburger and Banh Mi was a little too weird for me.  - Truffle Fries- 3 stars. Nothing special. - Duck in steamed bun (forgot what it was called) 1 star. Tasted like all of the nasty parts of the duck were used. I could barely bite a piece off. It was chewy and bland.  Back to the service, it was a really long wait for our food to come out. There were a bunch of empty tables, yet the the wait to be seated was about 30 minutes. It looked like there was only one waitress on our half of the restaurant. For a weekend, they should've been more prepared.",

But not to be derailed by their holiday closing we returned the very next day 37 seconds before they opened. Yeah, cause thats how Tanya S rolls!  When you first enter you notice how clean everything looks. Nice tables, lighting ext. The ambiance was on! We were immediately greeted by the hostess who took excellent care of us as well.  We started of first with the pecking duck buns (~$12 for 3) and they were SO good. The pecking duck was toped with a slice of boiled egg and some greens.....it also came with a dipping sauce that was so tasty.  Next we had to share the Truffle and Parmesan fries (~$4). These were AWESOME! The tamatoey dipping sauce was perfect and the overall taste just won me over.  I had the Ronin Burger (~$9) and it was amazing! It was a teriyaki based burger with fried egg on it, Asian slaw, and caramalized onions. Every now and then I would take a bite and get a little too much ginger for my taste but the burger was amazing! The meat was cooked medium and the bun was so good.  We had planned to try desert but by this time we were stuffed! So on the menu next time we venture to BB: Ox Tail Soup and the mini doughnuts.   If I wasn't already taken I would marry Bachi Burger....just saying",

They claimed to have called our name, but it was never called and two parties ended up sitting before us. The food was poor quality and noodles weren't cooked, no egg came in the soup even though we were told it did. We ordered a beer and chili sauce that never came. We had to go track someone down for water and the bill. When asked if we could split the bill with cash and the rest on card they said no because the card had to be swiped first. We then told them to split the bill between two cards and the waitress came back and said that she only swiped one card, without even asking. I wouldn't recommend Bachi Burger. I've heard good things and the group that I was with, went in the past and said that the food and the service has done a complete 180.",

    "text": "I'm writing this review as a long time customer who will never return.  I've been eating here a couple of times a month since they opened. At first I used to go in with my family and friends, but eventually the service sucked so bad I started taking my food to go.  No big deal, as I live two blocks away, and I still loved the food.   Recently they instituted a policy that you had to give a credit card number to place a to go order. That's right folks, you have to give your personal financial information to a nameless stranger over the phone for...a cheeseburger.  Ridiculous.   I often pick up burgers on my way home from work, so I just told them I couldn't give a cc number since I was driving.   They were often cautiously polite, asking for reassurance that I would actually show up...for a cheeseburger.  Tonight I called as usual, and the young lady on the phone refused to take my order.  \"If you're already on your way here, then why don't you just order when you get here?\" Oh, really?  Look, I'm not going to knock the food. Despite all of the poor service and B.S., I've still been eating here for three years. It's that good. But I'm going to miss it. It's not worth it anymore.     I've been in the restaurant biz for twenty years, fifteen of them in Las Vegas. I know how these things work, and I can tell you that the flaws of this business are the fault of the ownership. I'm guessing it's owned by a chef, because the food, concept, and consistency of product are great. But they are clueless about how to run the front of the house. Lack of training, no supervision, (I've eaten here dozens of times and never seen anyone resembling a real manager) and ridiculous policies that no one with a clue about customer service would implement.   It's too bad. I'll miss it. But I won't return.",

They are all so different, its hard to even describe to someone what they might like. I recommend you come here with a bunch of people and everyone takes a small slice of each burger :)  The french fries are awesome as well, nice and crispy with a few different flavor selections, all are good.   Nice staff as well, always have had a pleasant experience here.",

We ordered oxtail chili cheese fries, one of my sisters ordered a kalbi burger, the other ordered a Miyagi-San burger, I got the banh mi burger, and my boyfriend got the spicy miso burger. We finished the fries, which were oh-so-delicious! They were a little sweet, savory, and the egg on top made it a million times better. Excellent. The burgers were awesome, but we didn't have room in our tummies to finish them. We did, however, finish them later that night. Even though we came before closing, they did not rush us. I heard they are opening a Bachi Burger in LA! Can't wait!!",

The service is really hit or miss though. By the look of the staff there's consistently new faces so there's an obvious turnover problem.  At times we thought we'd get around that by just ordering takeout but that's only if they decide to pick up the phone.  Don't get me wrong though we've had some very positive dining experiences too. Unfortunately we've had one too many dining disappointments that we'll only go here at very off peak times or if we're really craving that Miyagi burger and oxtail chili fries.",

The presentation of the burger was something they just slapped together. The bottom bun was hard...maybe the bread was old. It's hard to imagine that this restaurant would have old bread to serve because it is packed with people. Be prepared to wait a while for a table. The hostess will try to convince you to drive to their other location which is about 20-25 minutes away...not 15 min unless you are a race car driver. Lastly, the service was horrible. Our server or the kitchen lost our order and we were left waiting a long time for our food. What is worse is that the server never acknowledged that our order was not put it right away and did nothing to try to rush our food out.",

When the first order came, we noticed the portions were big and asked if it was two orders on one plate. The tall blonde female server (not our server) responded with \"..maybe the second one isn't out yet..\" Uh, ok.   There was enough staff, but oddly the service was slow. Like I mentioned before, it was not super packed. Food came slow. I understand that we were a bigger party, but we noticed the smaller tables around us hadn't received their food yet either.   They split the check by guest, which was nice. We ended up paying with one card, but it still took forever to get our card back.   Overall, the food was good, the atmosphere was nice. Ordered the Ronin burger. Everyone at our table ordered something different and enjoyed their burger. Staff was a killer for me. Not sure if I would go back.",

    "text": "AMAZING FOOD BELOW AVERAGE SERVICE / Experience  After 4 visits to Bachi over 2 months, two certainties - the food is great, the service and atmosphere is not.  Really nothing on the menu is not superb, but, the restaurant has a consistent \"we are too busy for you\" vibe, and it seems to be impacting some quality.  The good:  Perfectly cooked meats, and very flavorful blends. Even their turkey/chicken burger combo is seasoned well.  All the speciality burgers (we tried 6 different ones over the visits) blended nicely as presented.  You don't have to do much to modify, and we recommend trying as is to get the full experience.  The bad:  From the moment you walk in, this place is not welcoming. They seem to have the wait staff double as greeters, and they are almost always none to happy to see you come in.  Expect no greeting, and even if the place is half empty, expect to wait. Its their thing to put on a list - and they know nothing less then 15 minutes.  The place is lacking severely in a \"boss.\"  The staff is one of the most poorly trained across the board for a restaurant so popular.  Expect to sit for a while, have to chase the staff for drink refills, more ketchup or sauce for items, your check, etc.  The first time we thought it was an aberration, but, on every trip the same experience.  They are understaffed, and its odd but for always having a wait they do a terrible job of keeping tables turning.  While waiting one time (for 25 minutes) we saw two tables that could have been sat 15 minutes earlier trying to flag down a wait person to pay.  The fries were cold every time we ordered them. They either are sitting too long, or they don't have proper heat staging.  They don't put any condiments on the tables, and provide a small amount in crucibles.  This was rather annoying (also to other guests) we had to ask to get more, further stressing the wait staff who were trying to do it all.  They have poor support for the wait staff - odd that management hasn't figured out 2-3 bus staff can help them bring in 3X that cost in more revenue.   Bottom line - go with expectations that your atmosphere and service are subpar, but you get one of the best burgers in Vegas.  Bachi isn't after giving you a great dining experience, none of the staff are what you normally expect with the Vegas service quality (which is typically one of the best in the country - Vegas is about service).  Oh - and the lobby is the worst.  Room for 6 people, so you kind of have to linger in the \"smokers zone\" while you wait or just stand in the \"holding cell.\"",

    "text": "I figured someone should do a write up on this small, unknown local burger joint. They have been flying under the radar for  a number of years and I just wish more people knew about them.....I kid. This place is very popular for a very simple reason. It's putting out delicious food. I finally made it there last week and I was moved. I don't need to be blown away by a meal to appreciate it, but I love it when I have an experience. And Bachi Burger is serving up a unique burger experience.  I'd seen a number of of the over 1,000 photos posted on Yelp, so I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to order before we stepped in the door.   FOOD:Between three of us, we ordered Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, Kiki's Burger, and a Black and Green burger. All three were excellent. The high quality meat was cooked properly and was sandwiched in a a slightly greasy bun.  The star here is the flavor combinations they create with their burgers. Wow. You will pay for it (our bill came to around $65), but these were thoughtful, creative, and flavorful burgers. I see now that I should have gone for the more adventurous burgers. I can get blue cheese on a burger anywhere. Where else can I get Lup Cheong Sausage or Japanese eggplant on a burger?  Other places might have some of the same ingredients on their burgers, but I cannot imagine them doing it with as much style and creativity as the folks at BB are. I had a well crafted burger. If I'm going to pay more than $7 for a burger, I need something beyond what a Bobby flay recipe can offer me. I need an experience!  They prepare their onion rings they way I like them: sliced thin with a light batter. I didn't dare ask for ranch and betray my lack of sophistication whilst eating my $14 burger. But that is the only thing that would have made the onion rings better.  We also had fries, a house made soda (the Lychee was entirely too sweet), and the red velvet shake. Hubby fell in love with the creamy shake.   SERVICE: Our server was a professional. This was a busy night and he (like all of the wait staff) was taking orders, serving, and busing. With all of that, he never let our drinks get too low and he checked on us a number of times during the meal. There was a gentlemen there who seemed to be a manager who was keeping an eye on the speed of service and the table turnover. I like seeing that level of care given to providing efficient service.   AMBIANCE: Meh. The decor was nice, but there was a large party hanging out a the bar area and they created  tremendous amount of noise. But it's a burger joint. A little noise isn't the end of the world.   OVERALL: The food was outstanding. I feel like I am ruined for other burgers. I cannot wait to return.   Service: 5 Food: 5  REVIEW #50!",

I love everything about this burger.  The meat is always juicy, it has onions (good!), bacon (better!), cheese (best!), and this aioli dressing that is fantastic.  About once a month, I get a sudden craving for this burger and have to go back.  The kalbi burger is also something that should be probably be noted.  It's not just a burger with some kimchee on it or something.  The meat has so much flavor infused into it.  Very good, thumbs up.  I love the buns they put the burger on as well.  Its those buns that you can find in china town that's super soft and kind of sweet?  Even my cousin who said he despises those buns said it was good.  I always get the truffle parm fries.  In my opinion, its best NOT to share these.  Get your own!  =)  At about 8 bucks a burger and 4 bucks for the fries, its reasonably priced and well worth it.  I'll be back next month when my Kiki's burger craving comes back.",

We had edamame, which was good but not everyone's going to like it; regular and sweet potato fries, the latter being noticeably better than the former but both were good; Miyagi burger is five-star; kimchee burger (forgot the menu name) is nearly as good, the plain burger (for the 4-yr old) was good too.  Nice selection of beer; the Rogue River Hazelnut Ale is very good.  The next day, my sister and I went back for a ramen fix.  We split an order of the duck bao, I must not have had duck for a long time because I've probably tried it many years ago and vaguely remember not been impressed, and I wasn't here, either.  The rest of the bao was done just right, I'll try the pork belly bao next time for comparison.  We both had the tonkatsu ramen, she thought it was good.  I agree for the most part, but to me the broth was a bit on the sour side, and the pork belly didn't strike the right note for some reason.  The noodles and egg were OK.  I've had better ramen recently in NYC.  I'll go back, the miyagi burger alone is worth the trip.",

    "text": "After seeing this place on triple d I HAD to try it.  First stop after a 6 hour bus ride? Bachi Burger, man they didn't disappoint.   Started with the Oxtail chili fries. Incredible! Melt in our mouth oxtail meat chili over crisp fries, top with an over easy egg and freshly cut jalapenos. A little bit on the sweet side, but almost bought another one it was so good.  For my burger I went with the Banh Mi Burger. Quite delicious. Thick beef and shrimp patty topped with Vietnamese Greens and pickled radish/carrot. There is also a Vietnamese dipping sauce which is quite nice. All served on an awesome toasted bun.  My other friend got the Shogun Burger which could be possibly the best burger of all time. Nice slice of foie gras, unagi, waygu patty, all on that same awesome toasted bun.  You want to do Vegas right? Start at Bachi Burger, its a slam dunk!",

I preferred my selection over his, but they are definitely very different!  The Mr. Ho's burger is perfection, with the lapcheong (Chinese Sausage), and taro bun! That screamed greatness off the menu!   The Manga has a very subtle taste,still good,  but paled in comparison to the Mr. Ho's I had that was BURSTING with flavor.   They've upped the portions on the fries, and somehow I believe the Garlic Salt & Pepper fries have been improved! Unless I just hadn't had them in very long. Regardless, the flavor is always on point.  We also had a chance to try their special dessert, the Grilled Mochi Sundae. We both loved it! The grilled mochi atop azuki (red bean) sauce and a scoop of green tea ice cream in the middle with matcha powder sprinkled all over! Simple, but wonderful.   I can't wait to go back in a few more months and hope they have more items added on to the menu!  Bachi never disappoints me. oh, and rumor has it, they may be opening another location... shhhh...",

    "text": "Having experienced Japanese/American fusion burgers before (fist to chest bump with two fingers kissed in the sky for you B Man's) I still thought that the food at Bachi Burger was fresh, innovative and most importantly, delicious.  Bookending our first Vegas trip together, mi corazon was absolutely adamant that we stop by this restaurant on our way back to LA...  which made the 8 hour drive back home somewhat more palatable...  somewhat.  :T  More on that later.    And on a related note, I firmly think that the mindlessly reckless drivers that one invariably encounters on the long stretch of road between the IE and Las Vegas are terrible people...  and if they crash their cars in the median due to their utter stupidity, they should be left to their own devices.    With that said, Corazon immediately declared to all within earshot that she had decided on the Shogun burger.  I'd like to think that it was her sense of good taste and high breeding (after all, she is dating me!)  that led her to choose the delightful mix of American wagyu, unagi, foie gras and other accoutrements and not the fact that it was by far the most expensive item on the menu at $25.  \"25 Dollars!\" I mentally screamed to myself in shock and awe at the price tag of the appropriately named \"Shogun\".  \"Well, two can play at that game\" I told myself as I prepared to use my most persuasive tone normally reserved for dealing with irrational minorities and sleazy car salesmen.  Me:  \"Hey sweetie, great choice on the Shogun.  I was thinking, I'm not really that hungry.  Maybe we should just share the burger and get an order of the oxtail fries.  I saw another table order them and they're so big.\"  *inwardly snickering at circumventing an astronomical bill*  Corazon:  *small voice*  OK, we can do that...  but it's suuuuch a goood buuuurgerrrrr...  *heartfelt sigh along with sad eyes looking off into the distance a la Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind*  Needless to say, dear readers, I ended up ordering a burger for myself and mi corazon happily partook in her Shogun burger.  To add further insult to the injury that I am a chumo that gets swayed by sad eyes and a cute face:  I would ask for nibbles of her delicious burger and she'd purposely put her fingers really high up on the bun, effectively funneling my bites between her delicate fingers at 15-20% of normal bite capacity.  In response, I angrily accused her of culinary stinginess, but she responded with a heartfelt denial coupled again with sad eyes, and I just gave up the ghost...  $85, dear readers, for a couple of burgers and fries.  Still, I'd like to think the look of sheer bliss on mi corazon's face was worth it.    To also take the sting out of the bill, I made sure to hoard 80% of the delicious oxtail/aoili topping on the fries, as well scarfing down my 1500 calorie burger and a tall 22 oz bottle of Dogfish Head Pilsner.  And as we walked back to the car, ready to make the 280 mile trip back to LA, I tapped her on the shoulder, broke out my saddest eyes and asked her, \"Sweetie, I'm really tired.  Can you drive?\" and hopped into the passenger seat and promptly fell asleep.  Best $85 I ever spent.",

    "text": "Just don't know quite where to begin. When Bachi Burger first opened it was a culinary experience worth the prices of the food. Another couple, wife and I went on Sunday and what a change had happen since last visit, the wait staff was not the same for knowledge of the food on the menu and was confused easily. The appetizer of pork bellies on steamed bun turned out to be the best part of our meals. The burgers which are the star item on the menu seemed to have been downgrade in patty size by at least 30% and were over drenched with sauces, making the taste of the actual burger indiscernible. 1 appetizer, 2 orders of fries, 4 burgers and a couple soft drinks came to about  $120.00 with tip. I am only guessing but this sort of thing happens when business's are sold and to make more of a profit food quality is downgraded or the business has gotten so big that quality of food becomes over looked. As for me we could of had just as good of conversations, had we went to Wendy's for doubles and fries and way much cheaper. Sorry but iBachi was so good when it first opened here in the valley. Bachi Burger has gotten my last dollar and I will surely tell my friends to steer clear..",

[+] Ronin burger..yummm [+] Kiki burger...mine was a little over cooked, but I like how they have shitake in my burger. I also like their buns. Its very \"asian market\" style buns. [+] Pork belly steam buns...soooo fatty and yummy [+] Oxtail chili fries + Egg....must get ....it is sooo good [+] Edamame with ginger, garlic, chili....one of the best edamame I've ever tasted...perfection! [+] Kalbi burger...soo good [+] Truffle parmesan fries are good..but get the oxtail instead...so much better! [+] Lychee milk tea..refreshing!  [-] Banh mi burger...go get a real vietnamese banh mi instead.  [-] Fries with pineapple ketchup...its nothing special...and there wasn't enough pineapple taste in the ketchup. It taste like regular fries with regular ketchup with a pinch of pineapple juice.  [-] Strawberry milk tea..taste fake/wierd.   I will definitely hit Bachi Burger up the next time I go to Vegas!

    "text": "Honestly, Bachi Burger is one of the best gourmet burger joints in Las Vegas. If you expect to have a plain burger with your average toppings for just $2, then go to McDonalds. Otherwise, if you want a next-level, out of this world burger and don't mind forking out $13 just for a single burger, then Bachi Burger is your place.  The employees at Bachi Burger make sure that all of the ingredients are of the highest qualities. Like I said, do not come to Bachi Burger expecting a McDonalds burger. Their burgers are HUGE. The patty itself is thicker than the dining tables. The bun is even thicker, yet it also doesn't overpower the party at the same time. Regardless of whatever burger you get (I got the Miyagi-san burger), it's going to be rich, juicy, and full of flavors.  Don't even get me STARTED on the fries. No matter what kind of fries you get, they cook the fries to absolute crispy perfection. Their oxtail chili cheese fries, especially, is the best fries I've ever had. Oxtail meat, chili, aioli sauce, and French fries all on one plate with a fried egg on top? The combination itself sounds really weird at first, but it is so delicious and fitting that you'll wonder how no one has thought of it before. Even their fry sauce is amazing and nothing like you've ever tasted. Bachi Burger may be famous for their burgers, but their fries actually won me over.  Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone and everyone! I wish I could be a regular customer. However, I will definitely be back another day.",

The burgers that my husband and 18 yr old and me ordered were $12, thats why we let my daughter choose a burger we had no idea there was such a pricey burger and what waitress lets that happen, obviously not a caring one.

Burger was delicious but not worth $10 especially with no enjoyable side. Might try the Sahara location  but I don't plan on coming back to this one.",

    "text": "If you have the ability to make it off the strip and haven't injested enough beef products already to keep you steaming through the throngs of people - you NEED to make it to Bachi Burger!  The storefront is very unassuming and you actaully enter in the back from what I can tell.  The service staff is super attentive and very cordial and the decor is somewhat minimalistic with the exception of two flatscreen tvs - although each was playing either the Food Network or Cooking Channel - brilliant.  On to the food - by the name, burgers are the fare of choice - but Bachi has so much more to offer outside of the main entrees:  The pork belly steamed buns...YUM...melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness.  The pork is super tender and the rice-buns are sticky/gooey hold the roof of you mouth.  The hoisin BBQ dipping sauce is tangy and thick and a perfect compliment to the pork and the egg and the bun.  Sweet Potato fries - killer.  Probably the best I have had anywhere.  The Yuzu Citrus Aioli is a decent compliment.  (We found that the sauce that came with a burger was a better choice).  Burgers - Both we delicious and had the makings of an outstanding burger (depsite not being beef).  The Bachi fish is what drew me in - whew, what a burger!  The crab cake burger was outstanding.  Patty was thick and teaming with seafood and the sauce (ordered on the side) is what we used primarilly for dipping the sweet potato fries...even our server was surprised at that and said she would try it.  The homemade soda was a hit too - zinging with taste but a refreshing break from the typical coke/pepsi routine.  If we hadn't come for lunch, I may be inclined to try for an evening meal to try some of the sake.....just saying.  Go here!",

We decided not to get the Yelp offer of BOGO beer, because we just wanted to enjoy the meal.  My husband ordered the Ronin, Kiki burger and a side of Garlic salt & pepper french fries. We drank water. But I noticed the drink list has grown, also they have a good selection of alcoholic beverages.   As we engaged into small talk about the menu, decor, and his opinion of the place...out came our burgers, not long after we got our fries. I the presentation of the burger and fries are done nicely.  We decided to half our burgers so, we both could taste each others burger. I loved the flavor of both burgers and fries are very fresh. The server made sure our glasses of water never we're empty. By the way, the server was an older Asian male and with his accent sounded like he was Vietnamese or Thai. I always seem to get them confused.   Anyways, we definitely will be back because we want to try the rest of the menu. The big plus is that it is open late. My husband and I really like the flavor of the burgers, I had no complaints with the service nor the atmosphere.",

Because I was in a rush, I placed an order to go. I wasn't really all that excited about the experience of dining in, just wanted to see how tasty the food was.  After placing the to-go order, I waited around 25-30 minutes, reasonable.   After getting my food, I was beyond surprised. These are truly gourmet burgers. I ordered the Kiki Burger and it was delish. Also got a side of Oxtail Chili Fries. Everything was tasty, pretty expensive though.   All in all, if I wasn't trying to save every penny, I would have loved it even more. I wouldn't say its worth it, but I wouldn't say its a rip-off, its a treat.   Best gourmet burger i've had.",

    "text": "A more accurate rating would be 3.5 stars. I have mixed feelings about this joint. On one hand, I like that it's locally owned, away from the strip, and it's a fusion of an American classic with an Asian twist. But it's faulty service made me lower it's rating.   The food was great. My banh-mi burger was recommended by the server and it didn't disappoint. The burger was delicious with amazing flavor of mint and lemongrass. It came with a great dipping sauce that smelled like fish sauce. Other people in my group got the crusty crab, lonely bird, grilled fish sandwiches and they all enjoyed it. Our sides of sweet potatoe, truffle parmesean, and plain fries was a great complement to our sandwiches. It came in this pseudo-cool funnel container that's supposed to mask how little you get. Nonetheless, the fries were good but a bit thin. For dessert we got the Portuguese Donuts with coffee gelato, and their berry poptart. It tasted fresh and not overtly sweet.   What prevented this place from getting a higher rating was the service and weird entrances. There are two entrances. One with a couch and tv with a lounge vibe. The second was cramped and messy with chairs and newspapers. We were at the latter. I think this is totally detrimental to the quality of service. At the time, there was one guy working the front and he had to juggle both sides. He looked flustered while holding his clipboard. The wait time for food was unnecessarily long. Look, I like my food cook to order, but damn, if I'm going to be waiting this long, I better be shitting platinum, gold, and diamonds. I will say the servers were friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the food. The place is new, so I'm giving it another chance. And I'm intrigued about their other items. Especially their steamed sandwiches. I would recommend it but hopefully you don't have to wait 20-30 minutes for a burger.",

    "text": "One of my favorite burger places in town. First off, the oxtail chili cheese fries. Normally, I'm not a fan of chili, but I would eat a bowl of this stuff any day. It's not overloaded with cayenne or chili powder like some chilis, but is perfectly balanced. Smoky from the spices, rich from the oxtail and a creaminess from the fried egg on top. Put that on top of their crispy, fresh from the fryer French fries and you've got the best chili cheese fries I've ever had!  Second, again, fries. This time, the Parmesan truffle fries. The sauce is a mushroom puree of sorts with truffle, and lots of shredded Parmesan. It comes with a sun dried tomato aioli, but I prefer the truffle sauce poured over the top. Delicious.  And finally, the burger. This is the best burger in town. Now, I'm a simple person, not into anything complicated on my burger. I get the custom, the Angus with bacon and cheddar. Sounds pretty basic, right? Wrong. We'll start with the bun. They bake their buns in-house, a sweet, light, almost Hawaiian bun taste to them. They come out crispy and buttery, slowly absorbing the juices from the bacon and burger, and simply wonderful. Now, the bacon. Somehow, they've managed to make bacon even better. It's applewood smoked and caramelized, giving it that extra depth of flavor. A sweet and smoky taste in addition to the typical salty, porky flavor of bacon. Finally, we come to the burger. Juicy, tender, perfectly cooked a beautiful medium, perfect grill marks. It's a masterpiece of a beef patty. I can't give this place enough praise. Everything I've tried there has been delicious, but the three listed are easily my favorite. If I could, I'd eat there every week. Five stars. Ten out of ten. A+",

I like the sweet potato fries over the truffle ones, which were soggy. The pork belly bao were nice, but much less filling than a Kiki burger. The boba was frothy and less sweet than a typical bobo, which was a nice departure from the norm. But they have some classics on the menu -  including shrimp chips! YUM!",

I can't give five stars for only one visit, but it was close to a five-star experience. Someone there knows what they're doing, especially with the burgers. These aren't your typical teriyaki cheeseburgers passing off as Asian fast food.   First, the salt & pepper fries were first rate: thin, crispy, a little spicy (topped with some jalepenos). The fried chicken \"kara-age\" appetizer was also very good. They know how to fry food and season it to go with your beer.   The pork belly steamed buns, sort of like sliders with bao-style buns and excellent hoisin dipping sauce, were very tasty. My 7-year-old son gobbled them up.   I was skeptical about the Banh-mi Burger, but it blew me away. They go to great lengths to capture the essence of the classic Vietnamese sandwich, right down to the pate, herbs, and fantastic nam plah dipping sauce. Dip, bite, chew, smile. Repeat.  I also tried the Lonely Bird, a blended poultry burger (turkey/chicken) that somehow captures the flavors of \"tsukune\", the chicken meatballs doused in sweet sauce that you order at Japanese yakitori houses. Again, someone here knows their Asian flavors and makes sure these creations are not just burgers with different special sauces.   I can't wait to return to try their other menu items.",

The burgers were very good - nicely cooked, soft brioche buns, good flavors.  The fries are average, but the pineapple ketchup picks it up.  Service is very good - but the place wasn't busy at the time.  Pricing is a little on the high side.  Overall, it felt like an upscale asian version of Red Robin burgers.  The combinations are intriguing... each element is strong on its own, but the combinations may not always work.  I gave it 4 stars because I was satisfied but not overwhelmed, and it was good.  It is a place that is worth visiting at least once for the experience if you're into trying out a new upscale burger.  Not sure I'd go out of my way to eat here again - I'd really have to be in the mood for this type of fare.",

    "text": "I can't tell you how many times Guy Frieri has let me down.  Almost every Triple D location I've been to has been less than ordinary.  However, Bachi surprised me with their delicious flavors and Asian influenced burgers!  They use high quality ingredients, but everything is entirely affordable...especially n Vegas! I went twice on the same trip.  ---The Food----- I tried the Ronin Burger (medium rare---$10) which had 30 day aged Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing!!! (dipping sauce regularly found in Shabu shabu), fried egg, katsu bbq, and a citrus aioli.)  The meat which is super tender, thanks to their \"bachi\" style of grilling and the combination of flavors are sensational.  Another item you MUST get is their ox tail chili cheese fries ($12) which is in a different class all by itself.  Supreme layering of tastes that is indescribable.  I'm a lover of chili cheese fries too, and don't hand out these recommendations willy nilly.  I would not mind ordering this as my meal one of these days.  Their oxtail chili cheese Bachi dog is delicious as well! But the size could be better for ($10)  My burger quest to find the best has stopped at Standing Room in Redondo Beach, but this place comes a close second...which is why it gets 4 stars.  Bachi has three different locations in Vegas and the next time I go to Sin City, I'll be sinful and order more of their burgers! I encourage you to do the same!   Extra Notes Takes Credit Card Long Wait...expect a 20-25 minute wait every time Beautiful oriental decor Great Service Clean restaurant and restrooms Many TVs  Small parking lot Bachi, in Japanese has two meanings:            1) its short for Hibachi which is a Japanese style of grilling.             2) Its a word which means to treat others the way you want to be treated.",

    "text": "Bachi = short for Hibachi = Grill  My friends kept raving about this place and telling me to try it, so I went here on my recent trip to Vegas. I got here late in the afternoon at around 3 PM, and the wait was about 20 minutes. I think that's pretty good considering the other reviews I've read.   We ordered the truffle parmesan fries, Wagyu burger, and the Kiki burger. The truffle parmesan fries were ok. I'm not too sure I liked the truffle sauce that much. It tasted very similar to Asian cafe mushroom sauce to me, but a little saltier and tangier. I think I would have enjoyed the fries more if it had just parmesan on it.   While we were waiting for our burgers, I noticed the staff was in disarray. I saw way too many employees in the restaurant, and all of them were running around looking frazzled. The guests sitting at the table next to me were unhappy and complained about their burgers taking a long time. Our waiter later explained to us that they were having a problem with the computer system. I'm guessing some of the orders did not get put into the system, which caused the delay. Despite that, it seemed like a bad day for the staff. Our waiter did not even ask my husband how he wanted his burger cooked. When my husband told the waiter later that he did not get to tell him how he wanted the burger cooked, the waiter said he thought he said medium. Actually, I was the one who said medium. My husband always prefers his meats rare, so it's not possible for him to say medium.   Anyway, when the burgers came out, they looked just like they look in the pictures: juicy and delicious. I was quite pleased with my Kiki burger, although I found it just a tad sweet. I enjoyed all the flavors mixed in together with the shiitake mushrooms, juicy Angus burger, the veggies, and the soft bread. I had a bite of the Wagyu burger and immediately fell in love with the Wagyu. I think I might have liked the Wagyu more than my Angus burger!   I can see why people wait for this restaurant. It's one of the better burgers I've tasted, but the way that the restaurant was being run could have been a lot smoother, especially with all those employees. I'd like to come back to Bachi, but I hope that the restaurant will operate much more fluidly when I return. It would be good if they could expand outside of Vegas and open it in Los Angeles. I bet it would be a hit!  UPDATE: They're opening one on Sawtelle!",

    "text": "This is probably my favorite burger place in town. I usually go to the other location but this one was good. The service was good. The food is as tasty as I remember.   It's portions/price taste and service hit all the marks.   I typically have to limit my eating throughout the day to properly enjoy this place. Many times I will only go if I have someone to go halvsies with. I've been to a few burger places that charge you $3 for fries and bring you a pretty wimpy portion but bachi doesn't disappoint there either. They have several kinds and you should take note of the type of ketchup or dip yours comes with because you might prefer one over the other. I typically do with the regular, but ppl I've been with love the truffle and sweet potato variety as well. I've had the oxtail several times. They're with trying once but they're not a must have in my opinion.   My favorite burgers are the $12 ones. Miso and kalbi are the ones I clearly remember but I've tried a couple others. Two things 1) doneness - don't go beyond medium well (I personally don't go beyond medium), it's not as flavorful when it loses too much pink 2)less is more - a lot of their burgers have a lot of ingredients but sometimes too much stuff gets in the way rather than compliments. I recommend going with the simpler options.   Note: I've never tried the waygu cuz I don't think my palette is that discerning.",

    "text": "So here is my last trip in a nutshell: out of nearly all ingredients, service was MIA,  tables were a mess and food quality seems to have dropped off a cliff. A few years ago Bachi used to be one of the more creative burger places in town but they have been on a steady decline for some time. Go ahead and sort the Yelp reviews here by date and you will see that I'm not the only whose noticed that Bachi is circling the drain.   On this last trip, Bachi did a great job of making our party wait for nearly 30 minutes while half the tables sat empty. When staff was finally done ignoring us, our server informed the our party that the kitchen was pretty much out of everything: no Oxtail fries, no blue cheese, no duck sliders, no Portuguese donuts, and nothing on the ramen menu was available. Umm why didn't they just put a sign up to tell us this?   I ordered Kiki's burger which came out overcooked and dry. The desperately needed aioli showed up 20 minutes later after having to ask our server twice. I don't know how they justify charging $15 for a charred burger with some KBBQ sauce drizzled on it.  Food came out inconsistently, half of our party was done while the other half hadn't even been served yet.  What makes this whole ordeal even worse is that Bachi actually used to be pretty good a few years ago. The only reason this isn't a one star review is thanks to me fond memories of what this place used to be.",

That's $20 worth of yumminess in yo mouf right there.  Definitely worth it Truffle Fries - It was topped with what looked like gravy; something I wasn't use to.  Truffle and parmesan was subtle.  Texture was not as crispy.  I was quite disappointed with the fries here  Me: What's that pink fruit right there? Dylan: It's a Yamamomo berry Me:  Spell it and I'll eat it Dylan: Y-A-M-.......

    "text": "I'd have to say, I've been to this restaurant many times since it opened. As far back that I actually have had the meat based meals on their menu. Bison is amazing and if you haven't had the pleasure, do try it!   As a vegetarian, Bachi isn't really pinging a lot of my interest due to MOST of the menu items are meat based in some way. (Sauces, bacon, burgers, etc...)   When I have business meetings or want to enjoy a clean atmosphere, its a great go-to and the \"No Meat Here\" burger option is really tasteful.   Today's missteps finally reached a pinnacle that forced me to speak to it. At the end of the day, you would think this establishment would have worked toward elevating the offering. Bachi is known. From TV spots to publications, its no question of how they rose to success.   The tide is changing though and its time to really move into an offering that accommodates more healthy eating choices fused with the traditional flavors Bachi already presents.   Heres my complaints:   Was out of the best vegetarian option which is the \"No Meat Here\" burger. Worst part is Dillon was quite unapologetic about it. Staff should really look to turn around a let down like that in a better way and not default to \"there's a salad\". (We're tired of hearing it really)   Next, simple requests like iced water, appetizers out before entrees fell completely waist side. Speed of service is still a big deal, especially during a busy Friday lunch hour in a large commercial area.   The ask:   More Vegetarian options or enthusiasm to accommodate and reinvent for the customer on the spot. Work with the customer, explore the ingredients you have and come up with something fun! You never know, it may end up on your menu and a popular favorite. I've met so many chefs and cooks willing to take their skill challenge to new levels so I would think this is a fairly attractive opportunity.   Last, hire exceptional people. They should be excited to bring an experience for the traveler, business person and foodies that come in purely on reputation. The negative effect of an experience can cause ripples in this current world. Easy misstep with long term effects.",

I remember seeing this place on \"Diner's, Drive-Ins, and Dives\" and had to put it on my must do list in Las Vegas.  This trip I met friends who live in Las Vegas at this place for lunch and it didn't disappoint!  I chose the Ronin burger just based off the description: angus beef, cole slaw, carmelized onions, miso goma sauce, fried egg and katsu bbq sauce.  Making me hungry thinking about it again.  The burgers are big, so big that when it is served, there is a knife down the center to hold everything in place.  The flavors of the Ronin go well together and is one of their top sellers.    We ordered an appitizer plate of oxtail chili fries and these are uncomparable to anything else I've had on french fries.   Very tasty and messy!  The order was large enough to share with all four of us along with our burgers.    The staff that served us was very friendly and accomadating. The kept it up even as the restaurant began to fill up and get busy.  I will definitely be back.",

Where was the oxtail? Nothing elevated or special about this dish  - Kiki's burger: good, and probably the reason why I'm giving this 3/5 and not 2/5 - Ronin burger: disappointing, I only took a few bites   They also took the taro burger off the menu which was disappointing because that was my favorite burger.

We liked him a lot!  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - We always get these. It's topped with a fried egg and runny eggs make everything better! Fries were perfectly crisp. Chili had a nice flavor and the touches of jalapeno peppers gave it the nice kick.   Miyagi Burger - Fried egg and onion rings. Yum! We got this to split today because we are doing an all you can eat thing tonight but if we got two (like usual), we would also get the Ronin Burger. Meat was juicy and it had an Asian marinade taste to it. Onion rings were nice and crispy. Runny egg topped it off.

They quickly took the cup away and then brought one back in under a minute that did not have lipstick on it so my assumption was they took it around the corner, whipped out a napkin and wiped  the lipstick off and then brought it right back out to us  based on the amount of time it took.   Next we placed an order for Burgers and Fries the waiter brought out the hamburgers and said the fries will be out a little later. After I finish my sandwich a minute or so later he brought out the fries. They was room temp and really would have been better if I could have had my side with the burger.   Also outside smells like horse manure since there are apparently stables near this restaurant... our ticket was $44 for two hamburgers a shared order of sweet potato fries and two teas.

They've honestly put an amazing new twist on something so classic.",

    "text": "Boba and burgers... what can be better than this!  It covers all the bases when it comes to Asian food. Finding a place like this in Vegas... money. The Wagyu Beef Burger (Miyagi) has a very nice, sweet crunchy crust on the patty. The Ronin burger on the other hand, has a softer, melt in your mouth angus patty. It also contrasts the sweetness of the sauce with something else (something i couldn't figure out because i ate it too quickly) sour.  It's not just about the burgers for me though, not like Umami burger in LA. It's about the entire experience. The fries... the fries. I believe it's the garlic fries, but it is tasty. It emanates a slight bit of heat from the peppers. The fries also seemed to be cooked with some fish oil, which makes for an interesting flavor combination with the sauce.  And finally, the boba. Chewy, and simple.  5 stars  Almost forgot... get the portuguese donuts.",

Will definitely go back in the future to try different burgers.",

    "text": "When you're middle aged and been married for double digits, you start to not care if a restaurant is hip or trendy.  You just want good food.  This place, located in a small, suburban, strip mall, is decorated with open ceiling painted black, colorful prints of Asian cities, fake bamboo mats, and cheap track lighting.  Just the sort of place for young Asians with Pink hair and dragon tattoos.  But with all this hipness, it also delivers some delicious food.  I don't give 5 stars readily, but for these flavors and reasonable prices, I couldn't give anything less.  So forget about the ambiance and go for the great food.  While billed as a burger joint and food shaped like one, this not just a hamburger but rather a fusion of western comfort food with Asian and Polynisian enhancements done with great success.  The meat is high quality and generous.  The flavors integrated and complex.  Don't ask me what the names of the ingredients are because I think they are in another language, but they are delicious none-the-less.  A few things we have tried:  Sweet Potatoe fries:  thinner cuts of sweet potatoe, fried, and lightly salted with sea salt.  Comes with a sauce that is slightly spicy.  Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries: slightly spicier than the sweet potatoe, but I like it better.  The sauce is also spicy.  Kiki's Burger:  This is lighter flavored burger, slightly sweet with mild cheese.  Really good for the sensitive palate.  Kalbi Burger:  The first time we visited, my wife was scared.  She couldn't recognize any of the ingredients. When I pointed out that this burger had Kim Chee, which she likes, she gave it a try.  This burger is loaded with flavor.  It has sweeter flavors from the teryaki offset with sharper flavors of onion and garlic.  The Kim Chee offers a nice crunch.  This is my wife's favorite burger.  Spicy Miso:  This burger is loaded with flavors.  The egg is a real addition to the spicyness and meld of teryaki and onion.  This is probably my favorite so far.  Bachi Fish:  If you want to go a little lighter, the fish sandwich is outstanding.  Again, lots for flavors that meld.  The fish says it is pan seared but looked like it was fried.  But not too greasy and not overcooked.  All sandwiches are between 9 and 14 dollars and are ala carte.  So with two burgers and an order of fries, enough for my wife and I, total will come to about $30 including tax and tip.  While it might sound like a bit much for a burger, the flavors make it a bargain.  On the drink menu is an impressive list of some of the best beers on the market.  Based on that, I imagine the Saki is good, too.  But I haven't tried either.  Either will add about $10 onto your bill.  I guess I'm a little too cheap to go the extra distance.  So ingore all the BMW and Lexus machines out front and enjoy the food.",

    "text": "Normally I hate the words \"Asian Fusion\" but the sample size of various Asian cuisines is large and authentic enough not to butcher various cultures. I'm a fan. Easily the best (flavor : price) burger place in Vegas.  Burgers: So far I've tried the Miyagi, Kalbi, and Bahn-Mi burgers. And for the most part, flavor profiles are retained throughout the various cuisines. The Kalbi burger evokes Korean BBQ and Kimchi, and the Bahn-Mi burger tastes like the sandwich. What makes the burger special, however, is the texture profile. Unlike Umami burger, there is a light crunch on the outside due to a combination of caramelization and maillard, the same found on top-end steaks. Doneness is perfect and the burger balances texture and moisture, rather than having the patty soak into the bun.  Fries: Salt & Pepper fries. Delicious. Reminds me of Filipino/Vietnamese flavors (ingredient hint there).",

The prices were a little bit on the expensive side for a burger, but it is not too much more than you would pay for a burger at any other sit down restaurant. The one area where they excel over other places is that they cook the burgers to your liking, but also have other foods that most sit down burger places wouldn't off. Additionally they have some incredible in house fruit flavored sodas.  The feel is not too bad, but it would be way better if it was located elsewhere, and not in a strip mall.",

Located in a strip mall off the beaten path this burger joint does something unique and special with the gourmet burger craze. The beef is Japanese as well as the interesting toppings. It's not cheap but it's also not going to leave you disappointed and still starving. The have different styles of flavored edamame that far exceed the typical steamed and salted you get everywhere else. They also have some great beers to accompany the amazing burgers and a few are from Hitachino Brewery, like the White Nest  Ale and Red Rice Ale. Check out the menu online and I bet, no Vegas pun intended, it will make you want to go.",

We finally get checked on and 15 after they come back to let us know that our food somehow got pushed back. They were kind enough to offer something free. I declined and asked to have our food packed so we could leave. Keep in mind the restaurant was getting busy and we were just sitting there, while others could be seated. I didn't realize how pushed back our order was after realizing about 5 other tables received their food. If one of our food orders was going to take longer to cook, it would have been nice to know and I wouldn't be annoyed about all this. Unfortunately this will be my last time coming to this place. I'd rate this with no star but they won't let me. PLEASE REVIEW AND RETRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES!!!",

The road to Bachi Burger was an interesting one, as we were heading to Monta Ramen, then to Carnegie Deli at the Mirage, and somehow Bachi came up and none of us in the car had ever eaten there before.  So it was decided, to Bachi we go.  We walk in, and are promptly seated.  the place was smaller than I had imagined, but on a Wednesday night, it wasn't busy, so there was plenty of space.  We sit down look at the menu, and are pretty much floored.  The three of us had no idea what to get.  The entire menu sounded amazing, from the Ronin burger to the Kalbi burger to their special of the night, the Spicy Miso burger.  After hearing the description of the special, we decided at least one of us has to order it.  And the other 2 ordered the other aforementioned burgers.  To round out the meal, we each ordered some sort of side.  We had the sweet potato fries, the garlic salt and pepper fries, and the parmesan truffle fries.  Thoroughly satisfied that we had ordered almost half the menu, we waited anxiously for our food.  The wait was a tad bit long, but the music there really helped the time go by.  They had played really nice throwback, old school music along with some hits from earlier this decade.  Lauren Hill, Ice Cube, John Mayer, Talib Kweli were some of the artists I remembered (It Was A Good Day was the song by Ice Cube, such a chill song, and a very fitting considering the meal we were about to just demolish.)  They also had ESPN on the 2 tv's in the restaurant, but it was just sportcenter at the time, so nothing too exciting.  Finally the food had arrived, and we were ready to pounce like tigers.  The burgers were without a doubt amazing, all of us taking a bite, then rotating the plates, so we could taste all the burgers and their deliciousness.  I had to give the burger of the night award to the Spicy Miso special.  The waitress highly recommended it, and she definitely wasn't lying to sell product.  The fries were amazing, with the parmesan truffle fries stealing the side order show.  They tempted us with dessert, and boy, did we fall for it.  They had hyped up their dessert special of the day, and they once again did not disappoint.  I dont remember what it was called, but it was only 5 bucks, and between 3 people, barely 2 bucks added per person.  Granted the serving was for more like 1 person, we were all so full, that it filled up all the left over spots we could have left.  After it was all said and done, we definitely agreed we have to come back.  I can't wait to see what special they'll have next.",

    "text": "Ok so when I heard of this place from my buddy Jon D, i had to go at least check it out.  And I would agree with him 100%, perfectly 4 stars.  Not quite 5 stars, needs better desserts.  Our table of 11 people had tried all the desserts and I would say that the custom pop tarts were by far the best.  The Portuguese Doughnuts were quite overdone and very hard and worst yet oily/greasy.    But lets concentrate on the positive shall we?  Well the service once you get past the long wait.  And in our case our table of 11 people, we were told that it would 1:20 minutes wait.  Any by reckoning, they had drastically underestimated the time, since it was Black Friday and there were so many people there.  But we got very lucky and a party of 6 people had decided to just bail and take off, so were pleasantly surprised at the short wait time of only 1:10 minutes.   As for the food, it was as I like to say \"pretty ok\".  Nothing stuck out as awesome and nothing was completely a Fail either.  We had ordered most things on the menu.  Kalbi burger, Mr. Ho's, Peking duck bao, pork belly bao.  All in all a good list of choices available for you to eat.  Fries were pretty good.  Drinks were also good.   Now for the one sour point.  Well i have to take a star away, as the service here was a bit on the leisurely side.  It could take them about 20 minutes before they would come back to get you something that you asked for.  This happened several times, no napkins, and also quite some time to refill drinks.  Now I will say that perhaps it was more the short sighted manager on duty, who probably didn't expect that Black Friday would be so busy?  But I think they were understaffed this night.    Otherwise I can't wait for the LA branch to open up in a bit.  I was just in the Sawtelle area of LA over President's weekend, and saw the sign that they were coming soon.  It was rather bitter sweet, as they took over from a small Mom N Pop grocery store.  But alas progress marching on.",

First of all, we were sat down by the server Anh, he was extremely helpful in not only deciding what to order, but made sure we were at a table where we could easily see the NCAA game playing.   For an app we had the chili fried chicken which was spectacular. Way better than I expected. Also, I decided to try this strawberry lemonade they had. Honestly one of the best tasting drinks I've had anywhere. This is a MUST. As for my burger, I had the Ronin burger which has caramelized onions, cole slaw, and a fried egg on it. I have to say, it was a pretty damn amazing. Now mind you, as far as gourmet burger places, I'm from LA so I'm used to Umami and Stout (the Shu burger at Stout being the best burger known to man) but for an Asian Fusion style burger it was fantastic.  The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is merely because I still consider Stout in Hollywood the best gourmet burger place around. But as far as Vegas is concerned, I've yet to see a place that beats it.",

    "text": "SO happy we stumbled upon this gem! The amazing infusion of excellently asian flavors into these exquisite burgers make this place our favorite burger place we have ever been to, and we travel A LOT! As you can see by my photos, they were incredibly appetizing, the sweetness of the brioche and other magnificent ingredients made the Blue & Green burger spectacular! The husband and I are both not fans of bleu cheese, so we subbed it out for the deliciously amazing gruyere cheese. The one bummer is the expensively lavish pricing when it does not even come with any fries or sides of any kind... They have a M-F happy hour from 3p-6p I believe, and it says they have milkshakes (& adult milkshakes too) on their, but it's listed as the exact same price as they are regularly on their menu.. odd.. He go the unlimited iced Matcha green tea, which was very diluted, and around $4, my pomegranate & Ginger soda was only 1 fill for about $4.5 & very strong and delish. I <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftook.it&s=b34133c532050db3e3561fc827c40d96c2818a51af35736212726465f63ffe0f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">took.it</a> in a to-go cup, added water & ice and finished it all the way thru Whole Foods after. As you can see in the pictures, we also ordered the Kale salad, which was about $9 for my meal I believe, and since these burgers do not come with any sides at all included (that price you see next to the burger is legit JUST the price of that individual burger), we ordered sweet potato fries on the side additionally, for around $4 or $5 for that small portion that you can see in the pictures I uploaded. It came with some sort of Wasabi aioli ( it tasted like Wasabi, but was not sure of exactly what it was), and when I asked for ketchup I was brought a little dish of very odd tasting ketchup, not sure what it was, but somewhere else on the menu I remember glancing over they are option for pineapple Ketchup, so it could have been that, but it's hard to put a finger on exactly what that funky taste was.  There were some tasty looking items, and fun milkshake creations, including adult milkshakes, but we were so full that we will have to come back again and try that next time. Our bill for just those items was close to $60.. a bit pricier than we expected for that meal, despite it being very tasty.  They had so many delicious options, we seriously cannot wait to go back for more... Maybe if we win some moola on the strip.",

    "text": "A little over a year ago, I saw signs for Bachi Burger while I was in LV, and  wondered about it. This year I had the opportunity to research on yelp and make plans to go on my most recent trip there last month.  So, having done my research, we aimed for Bachi Burger on our first day in LV. At first when we arrived, we were a little discouraged because there was a group of 6 or so folks that looked like they were waiting in line outside the door. Luckily there was a super nice guy at the front of the line and he suggested I go inside and see how long the wait would be and get on the list. Good thing! The wait for larger groups was long, but they sat my party of 2 immediately. The wait for a table would have been 5 minutes, but we were more than happy to sit at the bar.  Our food choices (shared) were the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Kiki's Burger. I just could not pass up the fries, based on everyone's reviews. Ohhhh, they were really good!! I found them to be more of a \"fork & knife\" kind of fries, rather than finger food, since there's so much going on in there--chili, cheese, fried egg, aioli....All of the flavors went so well together, and yet you could taste the individual components, too. Yummy! The Kiki's burger was also really good. If you're thinking \"mushroom bacon cheeseburger\" ok...but there's so much more! First of all, three different mushrooms (shitake, enoki and eryngyii) make the mushroom flavor profile so much more complex. The cheese (gruyere) was strong enough to keep up with the mushrooms, and the sweet onion marmalade added a counterpoint of sweetness that just well, sang.   I ordered a house made soda--the cherry yuzu--which was also good. I'm not usually a soda drinker, but I just couldn't pass up the yuzu. It was a little more cherry flavor than yuzu, but that's ok.  Service was very friendly, and yes, like others have said, it was kind of like being at home in Hawaii--so many local-looking faces both working and eating at Bachi Burger. Hm, now could we just convince them to come home and open up a place here?",

Literally empty (see pics). Waited 7 mins at host stand before being seated. Another 10 mins before waiter acknowledged us. Food took forever to come out. Service was sooooo slow. Anytime we needed waiter we had to hunt him down. Only one waiter and one host and they both gave off the vibe that they hated their jobs.  Appetizers were good but burgers were disgusting. Everyone in my party said they were nasty and we all got really upset stomachs from them.  Place is also grungy inside; seats and tables rather damaged up.  They opened an Asian restaurant next door and it too was completely empty.",

I didnt tell the kids what they where eating at first and then they were a little weirded out, but still thought that these where the best chili fries they had ever had...  The day we where there it was packed but didn't set us back from getting in quickly for a party of 10 and fast service...waitress was so nice and on point.

When I asked about the large number of items that they were out of, I was told the owner just hasn't ordered stuff, and they're out of a lot of beers too and that it's because a lot of people are always coming in.  Eh, I'll probably help them out by not coming in, that way they won't run out so quick.",

I've tried a few of the burgers, but I never stray too far from the Myagi-San. We have an off-and-on relationship, and we like it. The ox tail fries are delicious, but warning for those sensitive to spice -- ask for a few less jalapenos!   The wait can be anywhere from 5 minutes to 45 minutes, but the burgers are so juicy and delicious, I think it's worth it. Maybe just don't come with me when I'm hungry.",

    "text": "So this place was highly recommended by coworker when visiting vegas. Arrived Tuesday evening around 8:30p and was told 30min wait so we agreed. Asked for menus while we waited and noticed the empty bar. Approached the host about sitting at bar and was told that they only had two servers and couldn't handle the capacity seating. Later we discovered there were actually more than two servers and empty tables in the very back. After ordering our drink menu the waiter forgot to bring our drinks and had to ask another waiter to please bring our drinks which they brought over within couple minutes after asking.   As for the food, we ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, Miyagi burger with onion rings, tonkotsu ramen, and banh-mi burger.  First off the oxtail fries has chili beans cheese garlic aioli and sunnyside egg on top. The chili beans seemed to overpowering over the rest of ingredients and tasted more of a chili fries dish. My Miyagi burger was ordered with med done but was dry and not that much flavor when compared to the Banh-mi burgers so not consistent. I suggest medium rare for more juicer flavorful burger. Banh-Mi burger was basically a Vietnamese fresh roll burger which seemed off.  And the tonkotsu ramen was okay. Thought the noodles seemed over cooked. Overall the quality of food and poor service didn't justify the higher prices paid. Vegas being the mecca of food, I know there are much better burger joints for less money.",

It could be the kitchen got back up with orders, or maybe the waiters/waitresses put priority over other people for different reasons.   I try to come here when it's not \"rush hour.\" Judging from people reviews they are slammed during rush hour which makes me believe the owners don't hire enough people.   The food is good. I will comment the food is very good but to be honest it's easily strip prices for very simple food. I didn't know this restaurant was on diners drive ins and dives. I came here to try it because I live pretty close. Which in my opinion is overrated.  While the menu is different (Kalbi burger, truffle fries, wagyu burger, etc) I feel you can pay similar prices by actually going to an Asian restaurant and eat the actual food the burger is inspired by.   This isn't a place I would go for burgers unless you want some fusion burgers.",

The girl stated she was going to split the check into 2 ways. Not really what we wanted since there 3 couples.   We ordered our burgers and it took approximately 20-30 mins to receive it. It would've nice to get an update instead of just silence.  After we were done, it took them about another 20 mins to realize we wanted the check. Then the entire bill was on 1 check, we asked Hawaiian dude to split it and he comes with 3 checks! HOLY CRAP, looks like you can split it 3 ways! Either A, trainer girl didn't wanna do the extra work or B, she herself didn't know how to do it.   It took a ridiculous 30 mins for them to run the cards for each check. Again no updates on why they were taking so damn long. The girl then explained afterwards on why they took so long, complications with using cash and card, different POS, blah-blah-blah. Next time don't let a customer wait for an entire tv episode. Be attentive!  We saw you guys avoiding eye contact!  So we spent an unnecessary 2 hrs at a fast casual burger place. Bachi Booty.",

We had seven people with us and spent roughly $130 and every order was messed up.   Our order wasn't super complicated, 4 people ordered the bison burgers with different levels of done-ness. My brother wanted his rare and with lettuce instead of bacon. 2 of us the KiKi burger, both well done and my daughter had ordered a well done cheese burger.   When the food came no one got their burgers cooked the way they wanted. My brothers burger had bacon, no lettuce and was very well done. My mom had to ask twice for them to bring him lettuce. Once after the waiter started tending to another table and he rolled his eyes when asked. Only one person got refills on their drink and it was once. The burgers had such potential but wasn't as flavorful as we were expecting. The bison burger has Brie cheese on it, but it was literally the size of a 50 cent piece in the middle so you only got a bite or two with it.   The women's restroom was disgusting. Pee every where. Literally.   Honestly we won't be going to Bachi Burgers ever again. I wish we had gone with our second choice.",

This time, I got the Kalbi burger. If you're a fan of spiciness and kimchi, it'll probably be your favorite! The ambience is casual with upbeat music shadowing in the background. I tried some of the tonkotsu shio out of my girlfriend's bowl which was good, but nothing too special. The service was good; neither overwhelming nor did I have to deal with a server abandoning me until check time. Lol  3.5 for the ramen 4.5 for the burger 4 for the service",

Wait staff was efficient, drinks were filled promptly, and the food was incredible.   I'm not a burger fan, so I opted for the ox tail fries. By the look on my server's face I knew I made a good decision.   The fries were crisp, the toppings were just perfect, and the meat was nice and tender. It was a great flavor combination.   Not being a burger fan I probably won't be coming back here often, but would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a tasty, filling meal.",

The service was very fast and staff was friendly. I ordered the white and red sangria and they were both equally delicious! We also had the truffle fries, which are always fantastic and come with a tomato type sauce to dip in. I ordered the Myagi-san burger and it was amazing,  although the egg was a little overcooked for my taste. My husband ordered the shoyu ramen and it wasn't as good as usual. There was an strong flavor of tap water in the broth. This place is amazing 9 times out of 10. I would highly recommend to anyone who likes ramen or unique Asia inspired burgers.",

    "text": "Oh Bachi, if this were 6 months ago you would've been a 5. But you've kind of let yourself go a little... maybe you're getting too comfortable?   Anyway Bachi Burger is one of those foodie locations that all my friends seem to want to try when they visit Vegas and I usually do highly recommend it to visitors. The restaurant is on the small side, very casual, and filled with tons of modern angry panda art. Their menu covers a huge variety of Asian cultures and flavors in a fusion format combined with classic American burger options such as bacon and fried onions. Generally sweeter than salty. If you really want to get fancy feel free to slap on a side of foie gras though. They have a nice selection of beverages and craft beer as well.   Things I like: Spicy Miso burger, KiKi's burger (underrated but I love the mushrooms and bacon and gruyere), oxtail fries, sweet potato fries, Hitachino Nest white ale. I haven't met a burger I didn't like!   Things I dislike: My waiter - he was awkward and cracked a \"Ho\" joke, regarding \"Mr.Ho's Burger\", to a party of Chinese people one of which actually had the last name Ho. It was way more weird than offensive. My burger has been undercooked the last two times so I started ordering it more well done yet it still comes out equally undercooked. I hate asking people to take things back but when they do take your burger they return it to you with the same bun and patty but new toppings. I've never been to a restaurant where they've done that and it seems strange. Parmesan fries are slightly off too lol.  Overall yeah I'd still come back and hope I didn't get the same waiter and that my burger is cooked to a nice correct medium rare. When they do get it right THAT IS A TASTY BURGER doe.",

The restaurant was busy and waited about 20 min during lunch rush. I didn't like the place as soon as I walked in. It felt like a night club with the music blaring. I don't mind some mood music but when I have to shout to have a conversation then there's a problem.   Let's get to the food, ordered the oxtail chili with very little meat for $15 it was decent but not $15 good for some fries and chilli.  There was three of us and we all ordered different burgers. The problem with the fish burger was that the fish fell apart as you ate the burger so the fish was basically falling off the buns. The mr ho burger had way too much sauce on it and my grandma couldn't eat it. The problem with these burgers were that they were way to busy, multiple sauces that conflict with the burger itself.  I felt for the price the burger could have been bigger. Lunch for three over $60. I also thought their non alcohol specialty drinks were way over priced.",

The service is friendly and attentive. Took off a star because of how long it took for our entrees to come out but the server apologized many times for the long wait. The bachi burger was delicious! I recommend it to any fish lover. With an Asian twist, the burger is plentiful and savory. It had some sort of teriyaki soy honey glaze and it was amazing. In addition to the burger I tried the truffle fries and salt fries both were delicious. The salt fries had jalapenos in it which gave it a delicious kick! We talked about the burger the entire drive to our hotel. Will return and will reccomend this place to friends!",

Pork belly buns for appetizer = Yum! The bun finishes the taste to where it isn't too sweet, it's perfect.  My husband ordered the Miyagi burger, he said it was \"the best way to wrap up out date night\".  I had the Kiki burger which was delish. I wanted something simple but fixed to how I like it, medium well, mushrooms and Swiss, the patty still had an Asian flavor to it. As much as I wanted to put all of it in my belly, I couldn't finish it all, we will be going back to enjoy our burgers with beer next time, after my pregnancy. ;-)",

    "text": "Just today a friend swore by I'd and said it's the best burger she ever had. That turned into a challenge so I drove all the way there (15 minutes from the strip). When I got here the place was packed with a long wait line, but that made me more determined to find out if it's just a hipe or is it really that good.  Had the regular burger with garlic fries and oh boy was it good! The presentation is beautiful and the flavor is like a royalty chef cooked a burger. With my high expectations I wasn't let down at all. It's made the \"best burger ever\" list.  It's no fast food menu though. Burgers start at $11 and fries start at $4. But you can taste the high end ingredients.  Wish there was a Bachi Burger closer to where I live.  Highly recommended.",

The beef was really fresh, and I loved the bun/bread that was used. The creativity and diversity of burgers here was definitely interesting. However, the fries were a bit on the bland side. I still enjoyed the freshness of the potato. On the other hand, I was disappointed with the milk tea. There was way more ice than drink, and so I'm feeling quite ripped off. I could buy a bigger milk tea for just as cheap elsewhere. Overall, I will come back for their burgers, but definitely not going to order their boba or milk tea again. A littler bit pricy for a burger, but it was definitely high quality.",

    "text": "This restaurant was a mixed review from me for a few reasons.  1) The menu does not indicate that shrimp is added to marinade sauces, kimchi, ground into patties, etc. LET THEM KNOW IF YOU HAVE A SHRIMP ALLERGY. I didn't know when I ordered the Kalbi burger so I am thankful that 2) happened.  2) I got a wrong burger (it happens everywhere, so I'm chill with it)! I felt bad for whoever's burger I got, because it looked delicious but I cut it in half and instead of the Kalbi burger with kimchi I found... bacon? The waiter was very quick to take it away to replace it, but when I mentioned my shrimp allergy he told me that shrimp was in almost everything! Did I not read the menu very well? I couldn't find a warning anywhere when I went online and skimmed it.  3) The replacement burger they gave me just had lettuce and the spicy mayonnaise on it. Turns out, the kimchi also had shrimp (a lot of kimchi doesn't have shrimp, so I didn't think to ask if it wouldn't have any shrimp) so instead of being given the option to change my burger, they just gave me a very plain burger.  4) The plain burger was decently moist, the bun had the right amount of crispiness. The spicy mayo was delicious!  5) Service was quick and good.  So for all that the burger was good and the fries decent (parmesan, truffle oil, something fries), the lack of clarity on their menu for shrimp related items left me very disappointed and almost sick. Decent and quick service but it left something to be desired when I got the wrong burger and then a slightly plain burger to finish off the night without any choice for a change.  *Update: Boyfriend suggested it after seeing it on the Food Network.",

    "text": "I'm drooling as I am writing this review....  I went here last weekend and I must say, probably the best burger I've tried:  The following items I tried:  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries:  Warning, this item requires more than 2 people to finish if you are also eating a burger. Me and my buddy made a mistake in chowing this down first. A few points, its absolutely delicious, the chili tasted great, theres a friend egg on top and some cilantro, and some sort of mayonaisse based sauce. The fries were crispy, just wonderful, but yeah just make sure there's 3-4 of you to share, or you'll fall asleep after eating this.   Pork Belly Buns: These bun taco type psuedo-sandwiches are popular nowadays. (I've tried the one at momofuku in NYC, so that was the benchmark). Tasted very good, not at the momofuku level, but very well prepared. The pork belly was well flavored, tender and the dryness of the sliced egg really balanced the sweetness and fat of the pork belly.  The portion is a little small but these really should be appetizers.  Ronin Burger  Probably the best burger you will try, the meat can be either angus or wagyu (similar to Kobe Beef) if you have the wallet. Honestly you can't go wrong either way because the meat quality is excellent. I asked for Medium Rare and it came back closer to the rare end, which is perfect. It is literally steak tartarte in the center. Well flavored, can't say enough great things. The bun was like Hawaiian sweet rolls (Taiwanese bread).  Only downside is, with all the money they are making they should invest in a better ventilation system, cause all the smoke from the kitchen made it difficult to see the other end of the restaurant, but all in all a must visit. I'm coming back next time im in Vegas.",

    "text": "*I don't usually write reviews.  But for this place I had to.  **Good (albeit extremely over-priced) food vastly offset by TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE that runs on Filipino time.  First thing I did when I moved to Vegas was check out all the burger reviews/joints/best-of-lists.  You'll see In N' Out, Burger Brassiere, LBS, Burger Bar...  and Bachi Burger.  So I had to check it out.  When I arrived there, there was a wait and I was hungry so I figured I'd just order To-Go.  I ordered two burgers (Kiki Burger & their Special at the time w/ blue cheese) and two fries (sweet potato & parmesan truffle).  Simple order?  I thought so.  Like the reasonable prudent person, I asked how long it would take.  Melissa let me know that it would be 15 minutes.  15 minutes sounds reasonable, right?  That is if it were really 15 minutes.  So after waiting for more than 30 minutes (I timed it) and giving a dozen different looks into the kitchen/Melissa, I asked politely how much longer would I have to stay hungry.  \"Three minutes\", she replied.  \"What a completely arbitrary number?\" I thought.  But I'll trust her.    So 10 minutes later, wondering if I was high because it didn't feel like three minutes, I asked again how long it would take.  I think she finally started to feel guilty, so she said it was coming right up.  I'm so gullible.  So five minutes later, magically as I approached they started bagging my food.  It took another five minutes to finish bagging me up (they forgot my sauce) and ring me up.    Because I was far beyond annoyed after waiting for so long when I was told 15 minutes, I asked if I could express my unpleasant experience and offer constructive  criticism to the owner/manager/person-in-charge.  Melissa told me he's not there and she's in charge.  Great.  She told me to just call later and the owner would talk to me.  So I called later...  In fact, I called later multiple times and on multiple days.  I left messages.  Nothing.  He never talked to me.   Don't get me wrong, food was good.  But spending $32.43 and waiting more than 50 minutes for 2 burgers & 2 fries is not justifiable in any sense unless I was told from the get-go what to expect.  Instead I was lied to repeatedly, never apologized to or compensated, and was not even able to express my displeasure to those who count.  Arrghh... Just thinking about it makes me so angry.  Like a big emo tornado of emotion.  Thank God for In N' Out.   Peace Bachi Burger.",

When I arrived, I was surprised that it was a sit-down restaurant because I associated burgers with fast and casual dining. Nevertheless, the service was fantastic, and the atmosphere was lovely. The only critique I have to give is that I ordered a bison burger, but they were out of bison. Instead they gave me a wagyu burger without charging me extra for it. I must say, I was extremely disappointed that they didn't have the bison. However, the burger that I did get was fantastic! The beef was juicy, the cheese was perfectly melted, and the fig chutney gave a hint of sweetness. It also included grilled onions, which I loved; and this is coming from someone who normally despises onions. Love the food, love the place. I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys upscale burgers.",

After a few days of all you can eat buffets and high priced restaurants, Bachi Burger was a very nice change of pace. I heard this was the best burger place in Vegas. I knew I had to try it. Here's my take:  What I recommend: If you love blue cheese as much as I do, go with the Black & Green. I have no idea why they don't call it the Black & Blue. I ordered medium rare and it was delicious! It's a great burger. The burger patty if flavorful in itself, but with the mushrooms, bacon and spinach- I enjoyed it very much. One thing that I really liked about the Black & Blue is that the burger is not overwhelmed with the blue cheese. I would say it's in every other bite. Pretty smart if you ask me. Be sure to get the Parmesan garlic fries. Wash it down with a good beer. You'll be glad you did.   If blue cheese is not for you, try the kiki burger. Different cheese, different tastes, but equally amazing.",

I was so excited about my Banh Mi burger (especially after all the rave reviews), but I found the burger to be so overloaded with toppings and sauce that the actual burger meat suffered. It just wasn't as juicy as a good burger should be, and the sauce itself was a bit too salty. Someone else in my group ordered a medium burger that came out still mooing.. When he asked them to cook the meat they were beyond gracious about it, but the \"medium\" burger came out rare again- hilarious- Ecoli be damned..There's so much potential, but Bachi burger just didn't work for me...",

It's definitely not a light meal. Paired this with a strawberry guava shake which was nice and thick and perfect with the burger. Also shared the oxtail chili fries which were spicy and delicious.",

My friend recommended trying this place out and it did not disappoint. This was by far the best thing I ate on my trip to Vegas!  I had the Kalbi burger and the oxtail chili cheese fries. I also got to taste the Ronin burger, and the pork belly steamed buns. All of them were excellent! I would recommend all of them. Bottom line: Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   The Kalbi burger was great. I asked for it medium well and it was perfectly done. The bread itself was soft and buttery, the beef patty was moist and tasted amazing! It also had kimchi as well as some lettuce. It has a wonderful combination of Korean flavors with picked cucumbers on the side! Everything about this dish was excellent and I would come back for more!  The Oxtail Chili Cheese fries were also great but I could have done without it...although their fries were amazing! Crunchy and not overly cooked.  Service was wonderful and our server was friendly and willing to explain everything!",

My wife and I sit down at 6:30, no line and no one at the door while the team shoves a 74 dollar burger dinner down our throats over nearly 38 minutes. Seriously, the ambiance sucked as a 25 year old supervisor is running through the place like a mad man yelling table numbers and reset directions at a bunch of staff that aren't near him or listening to him and creating chaos around the room. Staff are trying to clear items not done, I was 2/3 thru my burger when the server stopped the check. Are you serious? Still no one at the door. Too many great places in town to pay 16 dollars for a medium well burger ordered mr and get rushed out of the place. Sharing review with friends. A Shame too.",

Best burgers we have ever had. They had such nice combinations of flavors with the burgers. For example the spicy miso burger came with Apple vinaigrette, and normally I cannot stand vinaigrette so I got it on the side in case I didn't like it- it complimented the burger so nicely I can see why they had it in on there! Staff was also extremely friendly and helpful as to what to pick and what influenced the different burgers.   Absolutely wonderful and we would definitely come back. We fully agree with the assessment that these are the best burgers in Vegas!!!",

    "text": "I truly waned to like this place. We were in Vegas a few weeks ago to visit family and my husband recommended this establishment.  He happened to dine here with colleagues while on a business trip and he enjoyed the food.  I would like to explain why I gave them two stars.  Firstly, the wait was about an hour. There were no sufficient chairs available to sit inside the make shift lobby of the restaurant (it's pretty compact) so we ended up waiting inside the car while the car was running. Why? Well, it's summer and it is Vegas at above 110 degrees. Of course you need cool air! After an hour, we were seated and was waited on by a courteous server.  We ordered our drinks and he returned after 15 minutes to get our food orders.  Everyone in my family ordered burgers while I chose ramen.  The ramen came out after 20 minutes and we were told that the burgers will be coming out in 5 minutes. Well, 10, 20, 30 then 40 minutes went by and no burgers were in sight.  I finished my meal and my family haven't eaten yet. It was past 9:30 at this point. My Dad is diabetic and his blood sugar was low as he felt shaky.  He was not feeling well by the time their food arrived.  Shortly afterwards, we were handed the check/bill and my Dad has not even tried his burger!! How rude!!! I don't get it.  There's anything obviously something wrong with how this restaurant is managed and ran.  Tons of people running around by not enough people in the kitchen.  Needless to say, we left feeling swindled!  I do not recommend this place and definitely not going back.  Their only saving grace is the nice guy who served us. He was not the guy who gave us the check by the way.",

    "text": "So I dunno if you've ever been in a situation where you're really hungry and you're thinkin, 'Do I want a Burger, or do I feel like a hot bowl of Noodles?'  So typical..... I've been there on numerous occasions and let me tell you, I could ponder that fork in the road for hours...if only there was a place that served both..... Tadaaaa! Well, it's not exactly one place, more like two places adjacent to each other by chef/owner Lorin Watada; whose fusion burger fame, 'Bachi Burger' has propelled her into Ramen game - the current 'it' food in Vegas.  Not that there can be enough Japanese fare in my opinion!  Hachi Machi, give me a Bachi!!!   Bachi Burger is a Japanese Hybrid Burger joint serving the American classic  with Japanese twists.  It's become the culinary zeitgeist to throw a bunch of 'Asian' ingredients on anything and see what whacked flavor comes out (yack) yielding moderate to disastrous results.  Innovation is great but sometimes you just have to go simple.    But when I feel like having something other than you standard Burger fare, I look to Bachi - the flavor combinations are nostalgic and the burger quality is pretty good.  Also, there's a proximity and it's open all the time (unlike the Foodtrucks that are sooo good, but just a scheduling/coordinating pain).  There's a previous review of Bachi - go ahead and read and you'll get what I'm talking about below...  Did you read it? Ok, good. Just as a summary, they serve a lot of Asian style dishes as appetizers, Chinese Bao's, Chicken Karage and Edamame, so you get a harmonic blend of Asian bites with All American Burgers. And for a guy like me who has trouble deciding on one cuisine, I get a bit of everything like an international buffet..but with good food.  Truffle Parmesan Fries:  Parmesan Reggiano + Black Truffle Porcini Cream + Sun Dried Tomato Aioli.  In my previous posts, I complained that I enjoyed what little gravy they provided for this cone heap of Fries that they stingily provide. It seems that someone was listening; upon my recent visit, the Fries came with a generous portion of the creamy gravy that made those Fries uber luxurious and thoroughly fulfilling.  The Sun Dried Tomato Aioli does not work at all with the Truffle cream, however, since there is a portion of fries near the bottom of the cone that is not coated with decadent sauce, the Aoli serves a good condiment for those untouched by the earthy goddess...  Kiki Burger   I've had the Ronin Burger which was pretty good, and the Black and Green Burger was amazing.  But my favorite is the Kiki Burger: an Angus Beef Patty with sauteed Shitake, Eryngii and Enoki Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese and a Garlic Aioli.  When I first reviewed this Burger, my biggest complaint was that overabundant smattering of the Aioli drowning out the flavor of all the other ingredients, including the Burger.  Well, much to my pleasure, they had listened; the Plate was served with the Aioli on the side, which could be knifed on to one's liking.  This made a world of difference, you could taste all the awesome flavors that this burger has to offer: The charcoal permeated through the Beef, which alone was satisfying, the Gruyere + Caramelized Bacon elevated the unctuous bass level notes, while the Sweet Onion Marmalade was savory and sweet. I added my own level of Garlic Aioli, just enough kick to spice it up before each bite....Super delish!  So, now it come down to the Battle: who won?  For Appetizers:  I don't know, they both so different!! For Main:          I can't choose - they're both sooo good!!! For Dessert:      Bleah.....  There really is no battle, if you feel like having Burgers, ie. red meat, got to Bachi.  If you cold and need to warm up with a great bowl of Ramen with some great Broth, get yourself on over to Shoku Ramen Ya.  I love both of these places and it's always hard to decide each time I'm in front of these two doors!  Bachi Burger                                                      Ratings (Out of Five Stars)                                    Food:         4.5                                                    Ambience:  3                                                       Service:      4           Always start off with a plate of Gyoza, it's like a cultural tradition of Ramen Shops to provide these half dozen, moon shaped crispy delights stuck together like little piglets.  It's always a little game to try and pick them off without ripping the skin, retaining the piping hot filling within its crackling confines.  As for t",

They were super accommodating, considering we took up almost the entire restaurant on a busy Friday night. I had the Kiki burger and was very happy with the flavor. I mean mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere, and garlic aioli - how can you go wrong? My husband and I split an order of the truffle fries and I was really sad I had to share. The fries are slim cut and delicious. I really enjoyed the sun dried tomato aioli that came on the side, in fact I found myself slathering some on my burger. My husband had the fish sandwich and it had really great flavor. The fish was not deep fried, but pan seared which was unique and the glaze on the fish made it really tasty.   My only gripe is the wait time, since the place is so small. We recently visited and they had remodeled and made more seating. They even installed a bar/counter area to help seat smaller parties. I really like the new look and hope it cuts down on the wait time, either way the food is worth the wait.",

I've never had burgers that had a fusion of asian flavors... my [kalbi burger had kim chee in it!] tasty, flavorful, and the perfect size for one sitting.   star 4: price! everything was reasonably priced and you definitely get your moneys worth... if more!   I tried a little of everything we ordered and everything was an eye opening yum.. loved our experience here... except for that weird smell!  you sit around for awhile and it soon fades.. but bad smell and food does not mix.. not at all.",

Then upon finally being seated we were told there's an hour backup on food. After placing order & waiting on empty glasses of water, the server let us know he couldn't run my card because machines were down. We had to sit there an extra 25 minutes after eating for them to finally run my card. It's clear they don't care about their customers. I used to go here all the time but after the last few times of very poor & unfriendly service, I'll be going to Skinnyfats or Burger Bar at Mandalay for a much better burger & service.",

I had to see what all the yelps were saying and what I could gather is that the wait is pretty long to sit down.  I figured that I heard so many good things about the burgers so it was worth the chance of a wait.  You walk into the the narrow restaurant find some big comfy couches in the front.  I thought, great there has to be a wait if they have these couches.  So we put our name and sat down with my 2 year old grabing Las Vegas Weekly and Seven magazines and piling them on the couch.  We didn't really wait that long and were seated pretty fast.   We sat down and now the next hurdle.  What do we order?  I didn't know where to begin. I scanned the menu and the only word that stuck out was \"Kimchi.\"  I had to order the Kimchi burger.  My wife ordered a regular angus burger.  We ordered fries with the variety of fries.  I think we got my daughter a grilled cheese.   when the food came it was awesome.  The burger had many flavors.  Try to go early if have a large group because when we were eating a large group was waiting for some time.  Bachi burger is in its own class.  I recommend! Cheers!",

    "text": "I got to say I was not impressed.  My husband and daughters have dined here in the past, but last night was my first experience and it was not good.  We took 6 people there from out of town and it was around 8PM.  We were seated rather quickly and then the troubles began.  My guests ordered the tapioca drinks and the rest of our party ordered beers and cider.  Beers and cider were brought to the table quickly, but halfway into receiving appetizers, tapioca drinks were still missing.  I said something to the server and then a little while later those drinks came out, dripping all over the table and it was quite a mess.  I was stunned that no one in the kitchen had the sense to wipe and clean the glasses off.  On to appetizers.  We ordered shrimp chips, no cigar.  They were out of them.  Truffle fries were just so so.  The Oxtail fries were not the greatest.  The beans were far too raw. I am not talking al dente, rather RAW.  Now come our burgers.  I ordered the Kiki, medium well.  It so happens I get the mid rare. When the overly zealous manager came to check on how everything was I showed him my not so cooked burger.  He took it away.  15 minutes later, everyone else at the table was done eating and my burger appears.  Not a newly fired one, but the one I took a bite out of.  I thought they should have redone my order, not try to recook it.  All in all, I was very disappointed and somewhat embarrassed taking some very important people there.  And, our tab was in excess of $120, which, in my opinion, is a little pricey for what we got.",

I gave the one star, so I wont have to get into talking about how the service was. \"Angela\" the girl that helped me, was; sorry totally clueless, Learn how many ounces your burgers come in. its not so hard, ask your chef, or your manager, eye ball it im sure you serve it hella times in one day. Ok maybe im being unfair with the one star, but this is my yelp review.   order:  wagyu burger with  swiss and maple wood beacon with the specification of \"rare\" please, and the black truffle oil french fries.    25 minutes later my burger comes out looks delicious, The buns looked like they were glazed with love and passed though a line of inspectors for flaws, my cheese is yellow, I didnt know swiss came in cheddar! my burger pattie, very well done.   I wait patiently for \"Angela\" and as she comes to my table with a distraught look on her face. I calmy explain that I ordered a \"rare\" burger, at this point she doesnt know how to respond to me. I explain myself very respectively, and so while I wait for the awkward silence, she says to me \" well we can fire up another one, But we would have to charge you for it.\"  she saw my expression change even before she finished her last word. (awkward moment)  she grabs my plate and shows the gentleman who looks to be a manager, being kind and  understanding, he asked to have another burger re-fired , at this point, im knawing away at my truffle oil garlic french fries, and they are good, but first off, Ive never met anyone who thought truffle oil had any sort of aromatic value, and I understand this is a fusion restaurant, and Im assuming black truffle oil and wagyu gave them the $$. Well all in all my service was bleh, My burger, even after it was re-fired, bleh, and the $$, I couldve easily gone somewhere else and then go to another. Anyways the likely hood of me going back is slim, But everyone deserves a second chance.",

We had to think what restaurant is close enough and had some meatless options.  Since we have been hearing good things about Bachi Burger, we decided to see what the hype is about.  I have to say that they're vegetarian options are slim pickings for sure.  I ordered the Bachi Fish Burger, my partner got the That's Cheesy, and we shared the Garlic Salt and Pepper Fries.  I liked the Fish Burger but my partner wasn't a fan of the Grilled Cheese sandwich.  He didn't like the combo of the cheeses in it.   We traded because I saw his face and he wasn't liking the dish.  I liked it enough.  I thought the fish was overcooked and that made it somewhat dry.  They were pretty stingy with the tartar sauce.  The fries we're pretty good.  I just wish they were a bit more crispy, or at least let the oil come off a little longer.   The biggest thing that was disappointing was the service.  With a very generous staff, I was surprised how slow the service was.  Granted, they were full to capacity with people waiting to be seated, the service left a lot to be desired.  Took them about 10 minutes after I have my card ready for payment to be picked up.  Good thing we weren't in a hurry. I have to say again, this isn't a reflection of their staple, the burgers.  They might be a good place for burgers but I have to say that the service needs to be more attentive.  If you like burgers, I'm sure you would like it more.  Also, they need to update their menu on the wall because they don't have some of their items available.  Also, they need to have spell check.  Instead of Chocolate Hazelnut Ice Cream Sandwich, they had \"Cocolate Hazlenut.\"  I just think they should have more vegetarian options.  Then again, it is a burger joint.",

Ok, so about the food. It's delicious. I had the ronin burger and sweet potato fries. The burger was nice and juicy and flavorful, like amazing flavor. The fries were so good. If you've never had sweet potato fries, over them. I would say they are borderline dessertish with a nice salty sweet mixture of flavors. Btw Lantz the server is awesome. Good attitude and really good with explaining everything and making suggestions.",

I rather so fukuburger or slidn thru...",

    "text": "I decided to try this place after reading all the reviews, boy was i wrong!!  I live in Orange County, was in town decided go out the way to this place instead of eating the overpriced food in the hotel.  Low and behold it's definitely overpriced for not so great food.  I'm not a food snob, but I'd like to think I know what great food tastes like.   Oxtail chili fries (what oxtail??) - can't taste the Oxtail and the chili itself is somewhat odd tasting left like a sour after taste. 2 stars   Duck Steamed buns - nice presentation, but duck was cooked a bit rare and so tough that you can't even take a bite without pulling all the meats off.  I've had better...I told the server and he was nice enough to it take off the bill. 1 star  Miso Burger - I thought it tasted pretty good, flavors all work together. 3.5 stars  Shogun Burger - Of course the server recommended this burger, it's the most expensive burger on the menu $25.  First off all if you don't know what Unagi is it's (eel) not everyone is familiar with the term.  My son who I think is a food snob wanted to try it, I only noticed it had Foie Gras.  Since it's illegal to eat Foie Gras in California, I thought we're in for a treat.  Let me tell you this burger combination is terrible...It has eel, Foie Gras, Pear, and beef, how does all this come together???!! Fish, beef, duck and pear in a bite is so weird and it left a fishy after taste, totally not what we expected.    At the end the meal for 3 people cost $70 that's we 3 drinks and with the steamed duck buns taken off the bill.    I'll take the all you can eat buffet at the hotels anytime...sorry Bachi Burger you're overrated!",

    "text": "Hands down the best burger I've ate.  I ordered Kiki's Burger.  The burger consists of a bun with a hint of sweetness, caramelized strip of bacon, several types of mushrooms and a sweet onion marmalade that balances out the burger perfectly.   The Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries were very good but did not compare to the burger.  Finally, I also had a side of their oxtail chili. This is definitely something that should be ordered.  Lots of oxtail and cheese!  The beans were kept to a minimum.  Overall I found the food quality was superb.  My only gripe about the place is that it gives off a pretentious vibe.  The decor is lacking.  Walls are painted brown with a couple of TV's.  The wall above the kitchen area contains two chalkboards with some items of the menu written out.  Don't see the point in that as the words are too small and congested to make out unless you sit close.  On a final note, the chef making the burgers seemed to have a hard time getting the meat cooked properly when I was there.  I noticed three tables sending their burgers back due to incorrect temperature, including mine.  A positive experience overall and I definitely recommend trying it out.",

I think because we were confused who was our server and they were confused whose table it was yadi yada.  It could have been a quick lunch but in the end it was quite exhausting flagging one waitress down, then another, then another.  Botchy!  Food wise here's the review!   *Oxtail chili fries - everyone else likes it, but I say 6/10.  Are you suuuuure it's oxtail? We didn't have much meat on ours plus I like oxtail because of the gelatinous-y texture and it didn't have any of that.  Also, our egg was well done...we needed a runny yolk to make this mission successful.  Fries tasted alright, kinda like McDonalds.    *Fish burger - really salty!  I think 6/10.  By the time I was hitting my last few bites, i just couldn't do it.  My tongue was numb.  But the bun was uber soft, uber pillowy.  Nice.    *Mr Ho burger - hubby rates it 8/10.  The lup cheong and mushrooms tasted really rich and complemented the patty well.  As for me, I thought my first bite of his burger was far too sweet.    *Strawberry lemonade 10/10!  Fresh, tart, not too sweet.  I could drink gallons of this.    *Cherry Yuzu soda 10/10!  Same as above!   So wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but from the airport it was a 5 minute drive and close to Tarjay so it's useful that way.",

Although when i finished and left, there was a huge crowd outside waiting to be seated.  Miyagi-san Burger; Amazing burger! perfect combination of Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings. Has a unique Japanese taste. Reminds me of eating specialty rolls at sushi places.  Kiki's Burger: Perfect combination of mushroom that gives the burger a unique taste. Hard to decide whether i like this more or the Miyagi burger. I would say if you want something less guilty... get this one! It was great, but not too heavy.  Truffle Parmesan Fries - Unique taste I would get this again. Prefer this over the Oxtail Chili cheese fries  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries- Pretty interesting to try once, but i would skip this and try an extra burger next time!",

    "text": "Bachi, you had me at Oxtail Chili fries.  With Egg.  WHAaaaT!?    I read on the menu and find Wagyu Shortrib Baos, yum.  OMG, then come the burger choices.  The following jump out at me: -  \"Banh Mi Burger\" (Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp and Pork Pate)  -  the Kalbi burger (Angus beef, Kalbi Marinade and KimChee) - \"Shogun\" (Wagyu Beef, Unagi, Foie Gras)  I feel like if I was telling you this review out loud, my voice would be an octave higher.  Even I am a little annoyed by my own high-pitched excitement (lol) and lack of more intelligent words but Its been a while (if ever) when I looked at a menu and I wanted to try 4-5 items equally - so this was how it felt to be happy and confused at the same time!  In the end I got the Kiki's burger (which was awesome) and I got to try a bite (or two or three) out of everyone's plate from our party of 4.  The duck, pork belly and shortrib baos were delish.  Damn, everything was good.  For you Vegas visitors, know that this is off the strip - but so well worth the trip!  Will definitely come back.",

    "text": "I've been here before and had the Shogun burger and Oxtail chili cheese fries. I Remember both being so incredibly AWESOME I had to come back, so we did. My wife and myself weren't all that terribly hungry, but it was kind of a \"to do\" list on the way back from Vegas.  We walk in at about 10pm on a Thursday night. It's slow and there's a lot of staff on hand. We get seated by a guy who seems entirely indifferent about his job and just life in general. You may be wondering how I know this about a simple  host /  hostess???? Because he was our waiter also. There were TOO many people working and only two other tables seated to get bad service. Not that bad service is ever excusable, but there are times when you understand to some degree.   Like I said, we weren't that hungry so we ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and a side salad; which sounded decent in the description. Micro greens, some kind of walnuts, avocado, and an orange vinaigrette.   The fries come out first and the first thing I notice was the fries to chili ratio. Way off. Too much fries and not enough chili. Not a big deal cause there's no way we're finishing them. We start to dig in and holy crap is there a TON of salt on there. Enough salt to start my own mine if i was feeling  entrepreneur-ish. We didn't complain because fries don't save well and we were already full.  The house salad then comes out. Being a MAN, I feel a certain sense of obligation to conquer this small salad, even though i already feel like a glutton (first world problems, I know). So I take a bite.....  GOD DAMN!!!! Did a salt grenade go off in the back or something? Not only were the fries too salty, but the salad? Maybe someone in the back just discovered how great salt can be and was of the mindset \"more is obviously better\"? Enough about salt. The orange  vinaigrette was good. The avocado was pretty much non existent (two small chunks), but the walnuts were delicious.  Maybe my memory deceives me, but i could have sworn I LOVED this place when I came about a year ago. Bachi has a unique twist on the whole burger thing, but that twist isn't good enough to keep me coming back",

    "text": "I'd have to say that Bachi Burger did a superb job of bringing Asian flavors into the typical American burger.  The buns and meat that Bachi Burger uses both have a distinct flavor to them that you could taste in every single one of the four burgers that I got a chance to taste.  It was very interesting to experience how the different toppings from the different burgers enhanced the inherent flavor of the meat and buns.  The four burgers we got were the kalbi, miyagi-san, kiki, and spicy miso.  Of the four, I thought that the kalbi and miyagi-san tasted the best, but that doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy the kiki and spicy miso as well.    The oxtail chili cheese fries were absolutely amazing as well.  These fries tasted less greasy than normal fries, and had a little bit of a sweetness to them that you don't normally get from normal chili cheese fries.    I'm not a truffle fries connoisseur, but the truffle fries here tasted pretty much the same as they did at other places that I've had truffle fries.   Bottom line: Bachi Burger is the end game to what all asian fusion restaurants aspire to.",

    "text": "If you live in Vegas, you NEED to come here (and damn you for being so lucky!).  If you're visiting Vegas, you NEED to come here.  It's seriously worth the little distance you drive from the strip.  And if you don't have a car, CAB it here, it's worth it, I promise!!!  BH took me here because we needed a break from all the celeb chef restaurants on the strip and wanted something a little more low key with dishes at reasonable prices.  What I did not expect was that the food would be as good as the $$$$ restaurants with a $$ price!!    The restaurant is very clean, spacious, and nicely decorated.  The waitress we had was very helpful and awesome.  We sat down and perused the menu, and we immediately spotted about 10 things we wanted.  We whittled the list down to a mere 5 dishes. . .the foie gras appetizer, the oxtail chili cheese fries, the kiki burger for BH, the Ronin burger for me, and a side of truffle parmesan fries. We finished it ALL.  The foie gras appetizer is only $12.50 and comes with salty mushrooms, sweet golden raisins, a beautiful reduction sauce and plump, juicy figs.  The foie gras was seared perfectly so it was crisp on the outside and soft and luscious inside.  Each bite rendered pockets of fragrant fat to explode in my mouth and coupled with the sweet raisins and juicy fig, I was on cloud 9.  The pieces of foie gras were also quite big. . .and for $12.50 I thought it was a steal!   The oxtail chili cheese fries were my next favorite. . .though it came a VERY close second to the foie gras.  The fries were golden and crispy, and very soft and fluffy on the inside.  The oxtail was so tender and almost melted in my mouth.  I don't like beans in my chili but I did not mind the beans in this chili.  It gave it a nice, creamy texture to the crunchy fries that was different from the gooey cheese.  The jalapenos were crisp and gave each bite a little heat, which offset the slightly sweet and salty chili, and the cilantro kept my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  Oh god, it was pure heaven. . .BH and I cleaned the plate and eagerly awaited our burgers.  BH's Kiki burger was pretty good.  I am not a big fan of mushrooms but his was very flavorful, the meat was perfectly cooked (we ordered medium rare. . .the meat was browned on the outside and pink THROUGHOUT the entire patty!) the bacon strips were candied, sweet, and chewy, and the bun was soft and pillowy.  BH commented that the bread reminded him of cha shu bao - asian style where it's very light and fluffy, golden brown on top and just a tad sweet.  I agreed and felt the bun really made their burgers.  My Ronin burger was just okay.  I was a little disappointed that it lacked a bit of flavor, imo, but I think it may have been because I had foie gras and oxtail chili cheese fries before the Ronin, so my palate might've been built up to expect something more. However, I think if they put bacon in the Ronin, it'd made it even better than it already is.  But I think if I had the Ronin without all the luscious apps, I would've thought it was perfect.  The meat, like the KiKi, was cooked medium rare, it was juicy with the soft, golden bun and the fried egg. . .it was a True delight to eat.  BH and I could tell they also put a lot of thought and time into their sauces, which came out very interesting and paired well with the burgers and fries.  The truffle parmesan fries were really good as well.  Like the oxtail french fries, they were crisp, golden brown, and had a nice, subtle flavor of white truffle with a bit of tangy parmesan.  It went with our burgers quite well.  I was so impressed with the meal, I flagged down our waitress and begged her to talk to the owner so they could open a Bachi in LA.  She said the owner is in the works and is hopefully opening one by the end of next year!  I nearly jumped for joy.  She also mentioned that the chef/owner used to work at Roy's Hawaiian and just started Bachi.  They plan on opening a ramen house in a few months, also in Vegas.  Ramen is abundant in LA, but I feel we have a lack of great burgers, especially Asian fusion burgers.    Overall, I felt the burgers were like a combo of Umami (in terms of creativity and presentation) + Bun Bun (for the Asian- fusion style flavor).  Bot Bachi blows both out of the water. . .by far.   The bill was just a little under $50.  BH exclaimed that it \"wasn't right\" because he felt he was somehow cheating them.  $50 for 5 dishes. . .each made with such precision and skill as a $$$$ restaurant???  It was the best meal EVER.  I understand prices in LA might be a bit more, but I don't care.  I just want my Bachi!!!",

    "text": "To put bluntly, if you're a burger lover, you will absolutely appreciate all the work that goes into the making of this over-the-top, eccentric, amazing menu.  I went to the Windmill location with my husband and mother-in-law, and we had been looking forward to this since seeing Bachi on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives.  I already knew everything we were going to order: the steamed buns, oxtail fries, and lots and lots of burgers.  I swear I wanted to order every burger on the menu (and I thought I could honestly eat every single one because I'm currently pregnant).  The wait: We were told there would be a 40-45 minute wait (lunch rush, totally understandable), and we had nothing else to do, so we sat. We waited maybe 30 minutes before being seated.  The service: We had great service.  The waitstaff were attentive even though it was crazy nutjob busy.  The food: We ordered the following -- (1) pork belly steamed buns: AMAZEballs!  I'm not a big pork belly fan, but the sauce on the side and the crisp radish in the buns make it a great appetizer.  It comes in a plate of 3, so we each had one. A fabulous amuse-bouche.  (2) oxtail chili cheese fries: very yummy!  Thin, McDonalds-like fries doused in chili beans, garlic aioli, oxtail and cheese. A huge serving -- you can easily share with 4-5 people. (3) Miyagi San burger, (4) Kiki's Burger, (5) Shogun burger.   Note: The Shogun burger is no joke.  A $26 burger touting amazing high quality ingredients like wagyu beef, unagi, foie gras, and a bunch of stuff I can't remember. It was incredible.  Foodies will delight, just as we did, I'm sure!  Drinks:  Make sure to ask which drinks have free refills and which don't.  The lemonade, for example, is fresh pressed and you order each separately.  All in all, 3 burgers, the steamed buns, oxtail fries, a large Asahi beer and 3 lemonades cost us $100.  Which, for Vegas, isn't bad in my opinion.  I can't wait for their Santa Monica location to open up in January.  This could be dangerous.",

Our server was so hospitable - he was polite, attentive, and really seemed to enjoy his job... his cheerfulness actually made me a little happier...

Love the Kalbi burger with truffle fries, Kiki, Ronin, sweet potato fries, their homemade pickles, sausages... everything I tried I liked!   It is nice that they combined their ramen with the burger place so now you can order off of both menus, so everyone can get something instead of having to only order burgers or only ramen.   The only thing that sucks is the wait time, if you want to eat during dinner time there is a guarantee wait time, especially on weekends. So either eat a little early or a little later...or go to their second location on Russell and avoid the wait time.",

I was excited to try it but mehhh - way overhyped and not worth the steep amounts they're charging for fusion burgers and fries.  Rachel and I had a kalbi burger ($11), oxtail fries ($11.50) and a side salad ($5). The food was decent and had very nice presentation but still this isn't a fancy restaurant and just because you make it look like Gordon Ramsay's BurGR, I suddenly have to pay prices upwards of 20 bucks? I got the kalbi burger because it was one of the more affordable options and sounded good. It is basically a regular beef burger with Korean BBQ style sauce drizzled on the patty and some kimchi that didn't have much taste. Nothing special. If I had some Korean BBQ sauce, I too could make this exact burger at home. The oxtail fries were good but nothing more than some chopped beef and a sunny side egg on top of some cheese fries. It was good but not worth the $11.50 price point which cost more than my burger WTF.  Service was decent and we kept getting water refills without having to ask. There are certainly some characters working here and Rachel and I both had some good laughs at the staff's expense. Inside jokes so y'all needn't worry about it haha",

Ratha was our waitress and she absolutely took care of us and helped us decide what to get. We both got the pickled veggies of the day, as well as the oxtail chili fries.

    "text": "Well, after nearly  2 years we decided to give Bachi Burger another chance(yes, I hold grudges).   I'm quite sure this opinion is not going to be terribly popular and I will definitely be in the minority, but I just wasn't all that impressed.   Allow me to explain.   We were thinking it wouldn't be that busy at 2:30 on a Monday, but that was way off base. This place was slammed! A far cry from my last experience, we were warmly greeted by the hostess almost instantly! Already off to a better start! We were quoted 3 minutes for the bar, but after 5 we were escorted to a table! Nice!  We got our waters right  away and went through the menu. After a few moments our waiter came by and took our orders. I opted for the Ronin burger ($12), while my friend tried the Miso burger($11.50) and we decided to split an order of the parmesan truffle fries($5.50).  Now it did take about 15-20 minutes to get our food, but since they were so busy, it was understandable. The service here was like night and day from last time! Our drinks were refilled without having to ask anyone. The hostess, the waiter, and every other employee was very friendly despite it being pretty busy.   Well, the food finally arrives and...well..it was ...okay. I mean, I just wasn't blown away like all these other people apparently were. I'm not saying it's bad. Actually it's not at all. I just don't think it's for me. My ronin burger was sweet, the patty was nice and juicy, but there was too much BBQ sauce on it , which made it pretty messy. I don't know. I just wasn't feeling it. Not only that, I had to go home and make myself a sandwich as the meal here just wasn't very filling at all.  The truffle fries were very yummy and very tasty! We did thoroughly enjoy those! They are served with a side of honey mustard, I believe.  I am glad that I was finally able to experience the famed Bachi Burger, but honestly, I just wasn't impressed enough to warrant a return visit. The service was good, but I just think I can get a much better burger at a much better price point here in town.  3 stars.",

    "text": "I have had this place bookmarked for ages, waiting for the day I finally get to Vegas! Finally finally I got the opportunity last week! We took a cab from the strip which was maybe a 20 minute cab ride. When we arrived there was people lined outside the door but only a 25 minute wait. The restaurant is small and not set up for waiting, we had to stand against the wall or wait outside. Wall please, it's 110 outside! To speed up the process we agreed to a seat at the bar. The bar has a wall up so you have to order with the waitress behind you, during this busy time I was not impressed by this set up.   I already knew what I wanted to order but hubby kept changing his mind. Even after getting advice from our bar neighbor lol and taking pictures of his burger, Hubby decided on the Kiki burger?! Ugh I really wished he got another one but his choice right?! Kiki Burger, Oxtail Fries, and Duck Buns, let's do this!  Kiki Burger: Kobe patty, onion jam, mushrooms, cheese and an added egg. Very disappointing! The onion jam was overpowering and super duper sweet! It completely ruined the burger. I can say the burger was cooked to perfection but the jam made it inedible. Hubby ate half.  Oxtail Fries: This was my favorite dish out of the three! The meat was shredded and tender! Loved the egg but wish it was bit less cooked. This dish saved this review.  Duck Buns: I should have ordered the pork belly buns! The duck was plain and bland. The sauce was sweet....I took jalapenos from fries and added it to the buns. Boo!  Service was great! Young gal was sweet and excited to serve.  If I ever get the opportunity to go again, I would. Overall glad I tried, next time we are picking other options.",

Environment: Good decorations, not too noisy, and tables are a little close together, but spread out enough.    Service: Our waiter did the bare minimum. He came when he was supposed to expect when we needed our check. Had to flag him a few times. In the end our busser was the one we saw more, and requested our check from.   Food: We had the Parmesan truffle fries to share. I really enjoyed those! They were the perfect crisp and seasoned very well. The sauce with them was yummy as well. Perfect sharing size.  I had the Kiki burger. It was tasty, but I felt a little bland at times. When I read the ingredients, I thought it would be a lot more flavorful than it was. A little disappointing, but still a good burger.  Same thing for my fiance's burger. He has the blue cheese one.   Overall: Decent fusion burger place. It was good, but we are not dying to go back.   Our total bill for two burgers, fries to share, and a coke was about $40 before tip.",

    "text": "Came here with some friends and enjoyed my meal. Only thing keeping it from five stars was the service and the value. It was expensive (at $11-$17 per burger, and burgers didn't come with any fries or your typical burger sides).   I was eyeing the lamb burger which won the James Beard award but when the server was asked about it he said they were out of lamb. We asked if we could switch the patty out and he goes \"no it's all out.\" Ok... Thanks for your help...?   Also the server didn't explain any of the condiments on the table. I hope this isn't the servers full time job bc he isn't doing himself any favors by being so sullen.   I got the Kalbi burger (kimchee) and it was good. Probably a 1/3 lb patty with a lot of thickened soy sauce. It wasn't as spicy as I was hoping, but it was good. I ordered it medium but it came out medium rare :/. Also, it didn't seem like the value was worth it. My $11 burger (made with regular angus beef) was good but it didn't come with any fries, or your typical burger sides. My party had to order the fries (see below) as an additional side. Other people in my party got $17 burgers which were made with wagyu beef, so that price makes sense.   The fries were extra but deliciously hot.   The restaurant was pretty basic but clean. Had two tvs on the wall so I could catch glimpses of the March madness basketball games.   Overall, four stars for the good food.",

    "text": "It's been almost two years and too many visits. Just kidding, you can't make too many visits here. Anyway, time for an update!  Bachi Burger is a fantastic burger place that I always recommend to friends and family, locals and visitors alike. The specialty burgers are obviously what you want to get, but don't turn a blind eye to appetizers and fries.  I've enjoyed the kurobuta and aribaki sausage w/ honey mustard, chili fried chicken, oxtail chili cheese fries, and the sweet potato fries before. However, my favorite side is definitely the truffle parmesan fries with parmigiano reggiano, white truffle oil (shut up, I know it's not real truffle), porcini cream, and sundried tomato aioli. I don't tend to have it while I'm in the middle of a Bachi burger, so I usually try to get them to bring it out earlier than the burgers.  I will detail all the burgers that I've eaten in reverse power rankings style:  7) \"Banh-mi\" Burger. Brownie points for the quotation marks. I always enjoy a good banh mi, but I am not a fan of this burger, and it still saddens me that this is the one that they chose to feature on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. The flavors just don't work or harmonize together for some reason, and I always steer people away from this.  6) Mr. Ho's. The highlight is probably lup cheong, a sweet pinkish red pork sausage. The problem is that the overall flavor profile is too sweet and only has that one flavor. Glad I've tried it, glad I'll never have to order it again.  5) Spicy miso. I had this tied with Kiki's before, but I've gotta make a choice. Nothing especially wrong here, and really love the fried egg. Heat seekers, do know that the sauce isn't that spicy, even for someone with a delicate palate like me. If I had a rotation, this would make my rotation.  4) Kiki's. My old second favorite burger. Bacon, lots of mushrooms, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli. Sweet overall but not too sweet, and a good layering of flavors.  3) Miyagi-san's grass-fed wagyu. Relatively simple combination here to accompany the default \"wagyu\" patty. Chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings. It's really weird though, since I specifically taking a bite, not enjoying it, then flipping my burger upside down and really loving it. I guess the flavors hit my mouth a lot better that way. Try it both ways and see for yourself.  By the way, I couldn't really distinguish wagyu from the normal angus beef, so you're likely better off not \"upgrading\" any of your other specialty burgers.  2) Manga. My burger from today. This was a special posted on the chalkboard outside. It is a 7 oz patty with sunny side up egg (presented without top bun not layered), sprouts, crab and scallop dynamite, and a side of pickled ginger. Apparently, enoki mushrooms also were in it, but I don't recall. Anyway, if you're a fan of dynamite, you need to eat this. The egg contributes as usual, the dynamite flavor is all there (most tender baby scallops I've ever had, by the way), the beef flavor is always there, and the pickled ginger can add extra sweetness if you so desire. I couldn't decide whether I enjoy it more with or without ginger.  1) Ronin. Still my favorite, although the manga made a really, really strong case. I think the yuzu citrus aioli adds enough acidity that it pushes the Ronin above a very strong field of contenders. Caramelized onions, Japanese coleslaw, miso goma dressing, and my beloved fried egg complete the flavor combination.  All burgers really should be enjoyed medium-rare. It's cooked, but you still get that nice pinkish center and keep all the juiciness. If you order it well-done, I will personally hunt you down and even haunt your dreams if I must. They have always delivered the right temperature and never gotten me sick, so don't under or over-order.  Some don't believe that it's the best burger in town. I haven't eaten everywhere in Vegas yet, but this is still my favorite place, even in spite of the recent menu-wide price hike. I will also note that some guy who writes a blog solely about Vegas burgers has apparently been almost everywhere, and he's named Bachi as his favorite. You will have to see for yourself, and I hope you manage to go early or late enough to avoid the ubiquitous crowds.",

The reason why I gave them three stars it is because they didnt have a lot of food in stocks. They weren't serving ramen and also they didn't have the loco moco. It took awhile to have our food ready.  It is a pretty big size. My friends and family struggled to finished it all. I would recommend sharing with your significant other or whomever. I got the Kiki burger and it was okay. You definitely can taste the mushroom. Also I ordered the fresh strawberry lemonade. It was sweet not sour at all. Overall, I would only return if my family or friend insist of coming back.",

Just slow and not attentive.   The food - I just don't agree with whoever put the menu together. There's too much going on in most of the items. When a place upcharges you for ingredients like wagyu, foie gras, truffle, you want them to shine, but bachi covers them up with a bunch of garlic, onion, sugar, sauces, etc.  My spicy miso burger had 0 amount of spice, and all I could taste was miso and sweet. The meat and egg were cooked nicely. The truffle parmesan fries were OK. They had parmesan, chives, truffle oil, and a mushroom sauce, and were served with another sauce on the side that didn't go with those flavors at all.   Glad I tried it, but wouldn't go back.",

The waitress came over and spoke with them and went to correct the mistake, however, she never greeted us. She then came out and checked on another table and went back to the kitchen where her and 3 other members of the staff were talking. After 10 minutes of sitting there without anyone coming to our table we left.    Apparently their business is so good they don't need new customers.",

Many workers walked past us and didn't acknowledge us even though it's very obvious that we still had menus and no drinks. We understand restaurants at busy but to not get drinks for over 15 minutes is pretty ridiculous.   Prior to arriving, we were calling for over an hour to ask to place a pick up order. The phone was constantly busy and when they finally answered, they put us on hold for 15 minutes and never picked the phone back up. After being put on hold we decided might as well just go and eat there after all this hassle .. sooooooooo as you can see, we were pretty upset already but I was craving the ramen and it was close by so we wanted to stay optimistic and hope the night got better.   The food was bomb. And the guy who helped our server was amazing. An experience and lasting impression starts once you walk through the door, and in our case when we first called. We will be back cause we love the food, we just hope the service is a lot better next time!",

For a more savory flavor to complement your bread and patty, try something like the mr. Miyagi or the oxtail fries.   Burgers are served without sides.

We came during the lunch rush on a Sunday so we had to wait about 15 minutes while reading through the menu. Our server Jasmine was awesome!! Super helpful and attentive. We ordered truffle parmesan fries, caesar salad, kiki's burger (MINE :D), miyagi's burger and just a plain ol' hamburger for my dad. We loved all of our burgers. The burgers were cooked so well, crispy edges but juicy in the middle. I was so into my own burger I didn't ask to try the other two :// My mom also ordered a strawberry lemonade and it was so refreshing for the heat! Will definitely take my friends here if I was ever in Vegas again.",

Men's bathroom door would not lock (single user).  Mentioned it to the waitress - got deer in the headlights look - no manager visible to get message to.  At least put a hanging sign on the door to give the next user a heads up it is occupied. 2.  Back up bathroom (on the noodle side) has a door that squeaks to high heaven, and it wasn't that clean. 3.  Music was too loud - politely mentioned this to our waitress (nice enough).  She said she would see what she could do (which was apparently nothing). 4.  Ordered the spicy pickles, which we do love.  BUT, they arrived right when our main courses were arriving, NOT when expected (as an appetizer).  Fail. 5.  Food was up to standards, but it is just not worth going through the hassle when everything is not up to speed. Just my opinion.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place. I'm only giving it 4 stars because the service can be pretty spotty. Sometimes the server is ok, most of the time, the server is absent. As in, forgetting your order (happened on multiple occasions), forgetting parts of your order (multiple times), and more! So the servers are absent a lot because they're off trying to fix things. I've never gone when it's incredibly busy, so I can't imagine what happens then!   I started going to Bachi Burger after a coworker recommended it to me, since I was new to the area. I love the Kiki Burger & the Spicy Miso Burger. Totally amazing burgers - juicy, flavorful, hearty, the whole nine. I recently tried the Spicy Miso ramen, and it is totally worth a try. Next time, I'd order the spicier version, because the regular spicy didn't have enough kick for me. I personally think ordering the fries (they come separate from the burgers) is a waste because the burgers are so filling on their own, but the oxtail fries do look pretty tasty.  Overall, Bachi Burger is a great restaurant if you're big on, well...BURGERS! They are phenomenal & considering the quality, the prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is nice, but the seating can be a little cramped. They offer other items as well, but I'm clearly partial to the burgers  UPDATE: I have since tried the Oxtail fries & they are amazing!!",

Firstly, we ordered 2 Miyagi burgers & both came out BURNT! Yes, literally burnt whereas we requested it medium rare. I took an effort to inform the server that the food is burnt.. she barely stopped for few seconds to listen to me & her reply was \"sorry, we are busy today so the food could be bit off\"..... BIT OFF??... It was 'burnt' for God sake... she just brushed it off as if I am making a big deal of it.  Cmon! I am a foodie.. I Love my food so if it's burnt, it does bother me.... especially if i am spending $16 on a damn burger.  Just think, Gordon Ramsey's Burgr bar at PH has an awesome Hell's Kitchen burger at $14 with exceptional service & ideal location. Why should I ever spend more to eat a Burnt burger with horrible service & who-cares attitude of the server? I will be reporting this incident to their manager tomorrow. Let's see if he can do something to get my confidence back in this place.  Btw, I am not even highlighting other service issue like no one filling my water glass for 20 minutes until I waved my hand 5 times...server talking to me while walking & not even caring to stop to listen to me...inspite of their App saying 10% off on the bill if you download the app, the server refused to honor it even when I clearly showed it to her..",

The burger was pretty good! However, it was a little new to me since it was a wagyu beef. Wagyu beef is a grass feed cow. It was a little too lean for my taste, to be honest. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it.  The place was very friendly and intimate. The food was fairly price. Overall, I had a great experience! I would definitely go back for that steamed bun pork. Yummm!",

But the fries itself was pretty good.   I originally ordered the Kiki's burger and my husband ordered the Miyagi Wagyu burger but then I totally changed my mind so we switched burgers. I personally like the Miyagi burger better. It reminded me of the Manly burger at Umami burger. And my husband says he liked the Kiki's burger better so I guess it all worked out.   I'm giving it a 3 stars because their food is really yummy but it's also expensive. Also this is the first place in Vegas that has decent boba. I've searched long and hard for boba places that can give me almost the same thing I had in California and this place came pretty close. The only problem is, like I said, it's expensive. And such small portions. But I mean overall I'd still eat here again.",

    "text": "I'm not entirely sure why people rave about this place! We've been here three times or more and have not enjoyed it any of the times. The most recent time was terrible.   We arrived and the place was empty meaning literally no one was there. We arrived a few minutes before two members in our party and they refused to seat us until our whole party arrived. We sat in the front of the restaurant with nobody coming in until our party arrived. Lame! When we finally sat down they took forever to come over to give us our drinks. One person in my party wanted well-done meat but the server insisted that he get it medium-well. He insisted that well-done was not good and wouldn't let him ruin their meat.   I ordered the kids chicken nuggets (for my kid) which are called something else I realize but let's be honest it's glorified chicken nuggets. He badgered me for a few minutes telling me 'oh these aren't chicken nuggets they are much more'. Get over yourself!   Finally the food came out after more then 45 minutes--Remember the restaurant was at this point almost empty--and they brought out the adult food first. Then more then 10 minutes after they brought all the adult food the kids food came... Uh what the heck! Sure my 4 and 2 year old are super patient and waited very well for almost an hour for their food uh not!   The food was bland and almost flavorless. The salt & pepper fries had no pepper and whatever other toppings were listed as being a part of it were not there! My black & green burger basically tasted like meat with a stale bun. It was supposed to have blue cheese (the reason I ordered it!) but no cheese to be found. I should have returned it but I really didn't have 55 more minutes to wait for a new burger and didn't want to talk to the condescending server about food again. On a side note the music was loud and awkward. It did not fit the lunch crowd!   This isn't out first bad experience here, but it will be our last! Service-terrible. Food-bland. Atmosphere-loud and awkward. Prices-extremely high for what you get. Highly disappointing $60 for a terrible lunch!",

My husband ordered the Sho Gun Burger and I ordered a bowl of ramen (which is actually next door at Shoku Ramen). I love that you can order ramen while you're sitting at burger place. I also ordered the bone marrow as an appetizer. It was my first time having it anywhere so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was a little sweet. I don't think I'd care to order it again but it wasn't terrible. We went on a Saturday around 4:30-5:00 and we waited probably 20 minutes for a table. It got busier once we were seated. I do wish their waiting area was a little bigger.",

    "text": "Was In Vegas for the week. Saw this place when watching Guy on Diner, Drives, & Dives. Had to try it...tried the Bachi 7 oz burger, the \"Banh mi\" burger, the pork belly bao, the oxtail chili cheese fries, the PB milkshake, and the apple lychee soda. Total cost was around $57.   Bachi burger was good! I think it was a brioche bun toasted creating a crust on the inner buns...sandwiched with red onions, lettuce, tomato, and the pattie that also had a nice crust to it and meat was still juicy. I kept telling my hubby that that's how I liked my burgers.   \"Banh mi\" was almost the same, minus the tomatoes and onion. In place was the usual pickled carrot and white veggie and fresh cut (although it was freshly cut) jalepenos on the side. Not much difference compared to the Bachi burger, but I preferred the Bachi burger.  Pork belly bao was good. I was expecting more from the pork belly, but I guess not. Just your typical cut of pork belly dipped in sauce thrown with a few leaves of lettuce and a slice of egg between the buns. Small and cute, but eh.  Oxtail chili cheese fries were Chilli cheese fries! The Chilli was overpowering and you couldn't enjoy the taste of True oxtail. (Because oxtail is super good by itself already!) The fresh thinly sliced jalapenos were a good garnish and created a kick to it! And there was a sprinkling of chopped cilantro.  The PB milkshake was good. I'm just not a big fan of PB like that. But the quantity for the cost of $6 was not worth it. Think of it like a $6 TALL milkshake (YES, LIKE AT STARBUCKS...OR SMALL EVERY WHERE ELSE).  And the apple lychee...it's apple lychee...not a taste you find everyday...but it was $4! (Perhaps 12 fluid oz size served in a long/tall (longer than a straw) skinny glass (because the straw sunk in the glass and you had to pull it back out in order to sip).  By the way, place was packed. Place just combined with the Ramen next door, so there was 3 total menus in front of you: bachi, ramen,  and a drinks menu.   Service: had to wait for table,  but it was quick. Had to wait for waiter. Waiter didn't come by to check up on food or drinks; only checked on drinks once towards the end. And it took a while for check to be brought after we had already finished dinner.  I would go back for the burgers; probably nothing else though, but who knows!",

Unfortunately for me batchi bueger didnt live up to the hype.  The staff was really nice and accommodating.  I appreciated our servers input and attentiveness.  We started off with the pork belly steamed buns. I enjoyed them they were something out of the ordinary and I dont usuall like pork belly. I would recommend you try them especially if you like pork belly.  I also ordered the truffle parmesean fries and the mr miyagi burger. The fries were just ok for me they were cooked well. I enjoyed the parmesan but I really didnt care for the brown sauce I believe it was a truffle sauce. The mr miyagi burger was just ok for me as well. It had way too many sauces and seasonings. You can tell its quality ingredients I feel there is no need to mask the burger in all that sauce. Even though batchi burger is off of the strip you wouldn't know that by looking at the price of the Food.  I would still recommend you check out batchi burger, but it was nothing exceptional and I dont plan on comming back.",

Server was nice enough, took my order brought me my drink and chopsticks. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen which was so salty. Not once did the server notice that I didn't have a napkin because she was too preoccupied with her two friends that sat at the end of the bar. So she offers my bill to me. I immediately give her my credit card. And she goes and exchanges a few words with her friends then does her rounds and then brings me my credit card back. So I decide to go use the restroom. Paper towels everywhere, whatever no big deal. I try to lock the door behind me and the lock is broken in the men's room. I mean, does anything work around here. It isn't her fault for the salty ramen or the broken restroom lock. Still tipped her $3 on my $10 bill. I also work in the food service industry so it can be hard I get it, but all around fail. Not sure if I'll go back.",

A friend wanted to go on a double date here and my husband and thought, \"why not?\"  I am so happy he suggested here!   Oxtail chili fries ($14.50)- A definite must as an appetizer. It comes with a healthy portion of everything the names says it will as well as a sunny side up egg and slices of jalapenos on top. It is easy to share and a definite crowd pleaser. I am pretty sure that everyone at my table considered splitting another one.  Spicy miso burger ($10)- This was my burger pick for the night. It came with a huge Angus beef patty, roasted garlic, cheese, peppers, onions, and a fried egg.  I was hoping for something spicy but it didn't matter, I really enjoyed this burger without the kick. It was full of flavor and cooked to perfection.  It is a little hard to eat cause of the size and sauces, so be sure to ask for some extra napkins.    I am sure I will be back in the future to try out their other burger creations. If you find yourself in the area and are craving a meaty treat this is the place.",

I convinced my husband to check it out after a late night out (they were open til midnight). We ordered the Ronin burger, Oxtail chili cheese fries, and the Pork Belly Buns. The wait was decent (probably less than 15 mins) for the time of night, about 9:30 pm.  The Ronin was an excellent choice if you just want to dip your taste buds into the Asian infused waters of this place. My husband (who's half Vietnamese) was nervous about trying the Kalbi burger, which has Kimchi. Go figure. But after sharing the Ronin with me, I think he's willing to come back to try all the burgers. The fries were delicious too. We'll have to also try the Parmesan Truffle Fries next time. My husband wanted to try a Pork Belly Bun, but half of the burger and fries filled him up and he couldn't eat another bite.  My son was asleep by the time we arrived and was too tired to wake up to eat, but we ordered the Pork Belly Buns for him just in case he woke up in the middle of the night and was hungry. Well, just as expected, he woke up at 2 in the morning and was hungry and ate the buns and he said they were good. He ate all three!  We will definitely be back here several times to try more on the menu.",

    "text": "One word:  Ridiculousness.  I already knew Bachi Burger was amazing before their appearance on Triple D, but they really have outdone themselves with one of their newest burgers.  But first! The appetizers!  I had the oxtail chili cheese fries for the first time. The chili is sweet unlike the norm. And I liked the spicy mayo-like sauce that was drizzled with it. Lots of flavor and definitely filling. Make sure you share this one!  I also had their pork belly steamed buns. A nice thick, tender piece of pork belly in every white, fluffy bun. The pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth amazing, but the sweet hoisin-like sauce was the best. I could drink that.  Now onto the main attraction! I saw their Shogun burger written on their chalkboard of specials and I knew I had to have it. A burger made with a wagyu beef patty, foie gras, unagi, Asian pear and miso butter with a Yamamomo peach as a palette cleanser.   They had me at foie gras.  I come from Cali where the delicacy was recently banned, so I was all in with this burger!  You start off with the Yamamomo peach which looks more like a piece of lychee. It's the sweetest piece of fruit you'll probably ever have. Good stuff.  After you take one bite of the burger, you'll feel like eating it slowly so you can savor each bite. The saltiness from the foie gras enhances the sweetness of the pear and unagi. And there's also a hint of truffle oil on the top of the bun. The combination sounded weird at first, but all the flavors really work together. Probably the best burger I've EVER had, but it has a hefty price of $25... WORTH. EVERY. PENNY.  If you love foie gras and burgers, you definitely have to try it. Share it with someone if you have to. Just make it work!  By the way, there always seems to be a wait here, so don't starve yourself too much before you get there (like I did). You need to be awake to try this ridiculousness.   I can't wait for them to open up their next location in Los Angeles!",

    "text": "Once upon a time, long long ago, Bachi Burger used to be my favorite restaurant. How can you beat great food, great service, and a great atmosphere? I didn't think it would ever come to this, but here I go.   The last two times I went to Bachi Burger, something was different. They changed my favorite item on the menu. I used to love their Spicy Miso Ramen. It was loaded with flavor and super authentic with \"strange\" ingredients. They changed it and quite frankly this thing is horrible. Either way, that wasn't what stopped me from going there.   The last time I was there our waitress Theresa was so belligerently rude. We waited at the door for over 50 minutes. When we looked inside 80% of the seats were empty, but we decided to wait anyway. I asked to see if everything was okay and the really nice hostess let us know that the kitchen was running behind. We understood and just waited patiently.   When we were finally seated we were approached by our waitress who looked at us and said \"Might as well get you some water so you can be more patient.\" Keep in mind this whole time we did not say anything. When she came back to fill out water again we told her we were ready to order. Now get this. She looked at us (no exaggeration), tilted her head to the left, rolled her eyes at us, and said \"Its going to be a minute\" and walked away. I am surprised we didn't get up and leave right there. We sat patiently waiting. 10 minutes goes by and she comes back and starts taking our order.   My dad has a thicker Brazilian accent and had a question about the food because of health issues. She wouldn't even look at any of us when we were talking. When he tried to ask her a question she rolls her eyes again and responds with \"yep.\"  Our experience was so horrible. I don't know what is happening with this place. Im not sure if there is new management or new ownership, but someone please keep an eye and try to fix this before it continues to get worse.   I believe I will give this place one more try. It definitely is no longer my favorite place, but I still think the food here is amazing. I hope that the last two time were just outliers and not actually the reality of what this place is turning into.",

    "text": "While my meal was pretty yummy, part of me tells me to give this an average rating because I've had many-a-burger in my life. Namely, Umami Burger and Gott's Roadside, just to mention a couple. I am from San Francisco and currently live in LA so I've had my fair share of gourmet burgers. Bachi Burger is good, no doubt, but it just didn't have that \"oomph\" I was looking for. Maybe it was the burger I had and I wasn't really feeling it (The Ronin Burger). The Truffle Parmesan Fries weren't even that good compared to other places I've them. I didn't get a chance to try other burgers or the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. I wish I had gotten a different burger because the Asian cole-slaw-like veggies in my Ronin Burger were not good. The patty wasn't even that succulent.  I think that this place is only popular because it's somewhat near the Vegas strip and tourists from around the world hear about it. Honestly, if you've had your share of American burgers from gourmet-est of gourmet, this place is just alright.  Service is great, the restaurant is spacious, and they seem efficient about seating people. Would I come back again? Maybe, but probably to another location and definitely not getting the Ronin Burger again.  Oh, also minus points for not having a fully functional website so that I can review what I ate.",

    "text": "This might have been 4 stars if we hadn't been so turned off by the service. Our waitress was not very accommodating and tended to ignore us, and the food took about 30-40 minutes to come out after we ordered. If it hadn't been for that, I might have rated this restaurant higher.   I was excited to try this place and bring my dad because he doesn't venture out to try new places very often. I thought he would like the asian-fusion style burgers and flavors. I was super excited to try the Peking Style Steamed Duck Buns because it's my absolute favorite dish to get when I'm eating at a legit Chinese or Cantonese style restaurant. I didn't expect Bachi Burger's version to be as good, and I was right. Overall, the flavors just didn't work for me (a lot of cilantro, radish, boiled egg, black vinaigrette and BBQ sauce) and the duck didn't taste fresh. Nice effort though.   My dad tried Kiki's burger, which is angus beef, shiitake mushrooms, caramelized bacon, onion marmalade, cheese and garlic chili aioli. I can't really recall how this tasted, so it must not have really made much of an impression (doesn't mean it was bad though). I thought that their burgers would be similar in style and flavor to Umami Burger, but luckily their burgers are bigger and seem more filling than Umami's.   We also shared the Truffle Parmesan Fries, which had some black truffle porcini cream on it. It was good, but I love all things fries. Expect burgers to cost around $10 each, which I would say is a fair price.   Atmosphere-wise, this seems like a fun place to go with a group to watch sports or just eat lunch/dinner. They serve a variety of milk tea/boba drinks also, which is nice. If you're looking for some unique flavor combinations and you have a taste for asian-style cuisine, by all means check this place out. But be prepared for less-than-stellar service, a long wait for your food and don't expect to be blown away by the flavors.",

This made my husband really cranky and we almost left, as we had a movie to catch.  However, the food was good.  We liked the oxtail fries.  I had whichever burger they said was their popular sweet one.  I *think* it was Ronin but I am not 100% sure.  I remember thinking \"IT's a 4\" because I mentally review everything I eat, but I honestly don't remember details.  I do remember that there was another burger I really wanted to try next time I go though (I think it was the banh-mi burger).  It wasn't as good as our local asian fusion burger place (LA Burger in Irving, TX) but it was good and I'd go back.",

I have tried almost every burger on the menu, as well as the duck buns. I haven't had anything here I didn't like! Flavor combinations are unique and tasty. They use quality beef, so I always order burgers cooked medium and I've never had a problem.  I suggest this restaurant to friends all the time. I have been here with my most adventurous friends, my Asian friends, my friends that don't like to try new things, friends who have lots of money, friends who have hardly any, and friends who climb on rocks. I kid you not, every person I've taken here has loved it too!  My favorite burger is the Bahn-mi burger, but like I said, I haven't had one I didn't like! So why only 4 stars? There has been more than once that our food took forever to come out. Also, sometimes they have a big wait at the door, but open seats. They say they won't seat because the kitchen is backed up. Lame. Hire another person.  Only other thing I'd change is their Boba tea just has a regular plastic lid, rather than that Saran Wrap type lid that most tea places have. Sad.  Overall, hit this place up, and if you do, I'll probably be there... Haha.",

    "text": "Boooo.  This place was totally overrated and not worth the money or time.    We got to the restaurant around 1:00pm on a Sunday and they told us it was going to be about a 20 minute wait.  We put our time down with the host and went to sit down.  30 minutes later, our name still wasn't called and people who had arrived after us were getting seated before us.  I asked the host how much longer the wait was and he told me he never put our name down on the list.  He said he didn't have the correct name.  This is also after he repeated our name to us TWICE when we first got there.  There was no apology for not having our name down, and when I was asking if they put it under another name by accident, another server or host decides to butt into the conversation and tell me that she called the name of \"Alex\" about 4 times outside an no one responded.  First of all, I wasn't even talking to you, and second, my name is NOT Alex!  This was already extremely frustrating.  After being seated, the host still never managed to utter an apology for his mistake.  We sat down, drinks came pretty quickly and was greeted by the server in a pretty timely manner, which was good.  The server took our order and she had said she would bring out the food as it came out, which was totally okay with us.  35 minutes later, we still had no food.  The table next to us, a party of 6, who was sat about 15 minutes after us, who also had ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, got their order about 10 minutes after placing it.  I asked the server how much longer our food was going to be because we had already been waiting 35 minutes for the food, she said we were 2 more tickets behind and that they were really busy, so the food came out slower.  We finally got our food after 40 minutes of waiting, only for everything to come out on the table at once.  Half of the things we ordered were cold too.  So after waiting 40 minutes to get our food, we just got cold food?  Seriously?  Yeah, I didn't know that I had to pay this much money for cold food.  Here's what we ordered:  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries:  meh, totally overrated.  The pictures people were posting on Yelp looked fantastic.  However, the egg was overcooked, and the oxtail chili cheese was full of beans and not really much oxtail.    Shogun Burger:  Since the ban for foie in CA is arriving soon (which is going to be the absolutely saddest day ever), I got excited when I saw foie in this burger and had to have it.  The foie was extremely overcooked to a point where it was just grainy.  Way to ruin a great tasting food item!  The burger was cooked to a medium well, which I had asked for a medium.    Miyagi-San Burger: This burger was definitely better than the crap the Shogun Burger.  It was tasty, but the meat was still overcooked.  Ordered medium, came out medium well.    Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns:  This dish was definitely mediocre.  You say Peking Style Duck, and I expect Peking Style Duck.  Some crunchy duck skin, some nice meat.  Instead, the meat seemed to be stir fried in some sauce.  Not exactly what I would expect and had I known it was going to be like this, I would not have ordered it.  The taste was alright, but I definitely would not order it again.  Salt & Pepper Fries:  Fries?  How could you go wrong?  They put jalapenos inside too, which definitely made it taste better.  It came with a tomato aioli, which was tasty.  But of course, something had to ruin it.  It was cold when we got it.  I don't know about you, but after waiting 40 minutes for food, cold fries aren't going to cut it.  Overall, this place claims to have the best burgers in Las Vegas.  I'm sure there are plenty of other places you could go to to get better burgers.  This was very mediocre.  While everything sounds amazing, it really isn't.  The taste is alright, but not worth the price and definitely NOT worth the wait.  Plus, the service is absolutely horrible.  UPDATE! There is an owner response to this review that I wrote.  However, the comment back is completely False.  I was pretty much being accused of not having tried the items that I wrote about because it wasn't on my receipt?  I've only been to this location once and I know exactly what I ordered since I went to the restaurant yesterday.  For me to be told that there are things that are inconsistent is ridiculous, given the fact that the receipt that the owner is claiming is my order, was not.  The items that is stated that I ordered wasn't even what I ordered.  It was also said the manager took our order himself.  That was also not the case, given the fact that we never even spoke to the manager once.  We had a server who took our order, just like every other table.  It is also claimed that our ticket was pushed ahead of 3 other tickets.  I think that's funny, since the table next to us, that was sat 30 minutes after us, got their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries 20 min before us.  This should again show what kind of service this restaurant provides.",

Walked in at 12:10, were seated immediately (about 4 empty tables).  We had studied the menu online and ordered immediately, did not even get menus.  At 12:39 we questioned the where abouts of our burgers....  We were told they got slammed but ours were next up did we want our fries first, we said sure....  At 12:47 our burgers arrived, but no fries, we asked for to go boxes, our fries and our bill.   12:51 another laid back server stopped by asking if we needed anything we said yes, boxes, our other food and the bill....   12:53 boxes arrive....   12:56 bill arrives still no fries....  12:58 I walk over with the 33 dollar bill to the manager and ask how long it takes to make fries, he informs me it takes 6 minutes but they only have one fryer..  I suggest maybe then they only have 5 tables instead of the 20+ in the restaurant that their kitchen can't handle.  I inform him I am not paying a bill for food I haven't even received.  He asked what I wanted him to do about it.    I informed him I would not be signing the bill and I didn't want the food and I walked out.     If it is a week day lunch hour, you INFORM your customer that you have 60 minute ticket times PRIOR to them ordering.  Give them the opportunity to walk out.  Also don't open a huge restaurant if you do not have the kitchen staff and equipment to serve your dinning room!!!!!!  This place is an absolute train wreck!!!!!

    "text": "As I savored a bite of the Kiki burger, I looked at my husband and said, \"Dare I say it? I think this may be the best burger I've ever had.\"    \"Those are bold words,\" he said, taken aback.  He took a bite out of his Banh Mi burger and, nodding approvingly, said, \"...but I think you're right.\"   We have scoured the Las Vegas Valley trying to find our premiere burger joint and always came so close but no cigar until Bachi Burger.     We started off with edamame and it wasn't the typical steamed appetizer you usually get a sushi joints. Their edamame is stir fried with chili and garlic.  We also had the truffle parmesan fries and were blown away.  It was such a great way to tease our appetites.   My co-workers strongly suggested that I order the Kiki Burger.  After reading the description, I knew it was the one for me.  Everything was perfection. The meat was juicy and tasty, the bun toasty and crisp, the bacon and onions caramelized... all of the ingredients created a harmonious experience. The husband ordered the Banh Mi burger and it also didn't disappoint.         I am surprised that other Yelpers experienced bad customer service. We were greeted and tended to by friendly staff and we were checked up on regularly. We received everything promptly.  Timing between each course was perfect.        The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars is really not that big of a deal but is a hindrance nonetheless. I ordered the lychee boba drink and I didn't taste a bit of lychee flavor in it. The husband ordered the calamansi soda. If we hadn't seen \"calamansi\" on the menu, we would've thought it was just regular soda. For dessert, I had the fruit tart and the husband had beignets.  Both were good but I'd probably just stick to the burgers next time.       I still catch myself daydreaming of the Kiki burger ever so often. I can't wait to find out what else Bachi Burger has to offer.",

    "text": "Bachi Burger is a nice composition of asian influence with all american hamburgers.  Pretty much everything on the menu looks amazing, but I didn't have a large enough stomach to try everything.  Just pick out one from the special burgers if you are adventurous and want to try something different.  If you are more traditional, you can get the standard burgers but go for the wagyu beef or kobe.  Be sure to also grab an order of the truffle fries.  One of the most impressive parts of my visit was the Black Milk Tea.  Maybe it was because I was hungover, but I must say it was some of the best milk tea I've ever had.  Service was excellent and it wasn't too crowded on a saturday afternoon for lunch.  Pretty much come here and try new stuff if you can.  Its a bit off the strip but its worth it.  Bachi Burger and Burger Bar in Mandalay will now have to compete to get my visit whenever I go to Vegas.",

    "text": "NEVER AGAIN.   I would end the review there because I refuse to spend more time on this place (and hope that no one else wastes their time either) but I guess this deserves some explanation.   Got here a little before 1 PM and was seated with the boyfriend. We were handed menus by a girl who said, \"Uhhh I'll let you have a minute to look this over and then send someone over.\" Uh oh. Already knew that no one had any clue what they were doing and could already tell this was not going to be a good indication of what was to come.   5-10 minutes go by and we haven't even gotten drinks yet - or have been able to order them for that matter. We push our menus to the side and gaze at the workers behind the counter to see if someone is going to wait on us. A guy finally comes by and takes our order after explaining that there was some issue with the computer. Rule #1: The customer doesn't care what is wrong. We are just hungry. Let us order and just apologize quickly for the wait.  When I ordered my edamame I physically had to point to the item on the menu since he wasn't sure which of the three I ordered. No, I'm not kidding.   5 minutes after ordering we finally get our drinks - water. Yes it took about 20 minutes to get water. About 5 minutes after that we get our edamame. It doesn't look like the truffle oil and garlic oil edamame I ordered and I ask him if this is the correct one. He says yes and walks off. Well guess what? It wasn't. It was the chili one. I physically pointed to the menu which one I wanted, then ask as it is set down if it is the correct one, and it's not? It's not like there are 100 different edamames on the menu - there are three. Had to get his attention to get us a new batch which came out a lot quicker this time. It was good, but had too much garlic oil that overpowered the truffle oil, and it was way too oily. Each piece was dripping - not too appetizing.   The waiter comes by a couple minutes later to give us the sweet potato fries (which were very very good, although I didn't like the sauce too much) to tell us our food is ready but they're waiting on the pickles. WTF? Then he tells us he is going on break and someone else will be covering our table. Right. Food comes out a couple minutes later. The grilled cheese I got was okay, but totally not worth $7. Matt got a Ronin burger which he thought was alright as well but didn't like some of the mix of flavors. The same waiter who I guess didn't go on break comes by and asks us if we want dessert which we say no, and then asks us if we want the check and hands it to us.   We walk up to the counter to pay and I hand it to the girl there and say I am going to be paying cash. SHE WALKS OFF. SHE FUCKING WALKS OFF WITH NO EXPLANATION TO GET FOOD AT THE COUNTER. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Our waiter comes by a minute later, my mouth agape and I pay and get out of there.   I said in a previous review that Macaroni Grill was the worst service I have ever had, but this takes the cake. I would rather exclusively eat at the Macaroni Grill for the rest of my life than return to Bachi Burger. All in all it took us over an HOUR to have what at other places would be a quick 30-40 minute lunch. No one knows what the hell they are doing and they also seem like they don't care either. The food was alright, but not enough to make me ever come back with that kind of service or lack thereof. Jesus Tap-dancing Christ on a cracker, if you hold your sanity dear to your heart do not go to this place because the service is absolutely appalling and I refuse to return to this establishment because of it.",

He recommended the Alaskan Cod burger and the Ox Tail chili cheese fries.  The best burger I've eaten so far.  My friend had a Wagyu burger (name of the burger escapes me).  Although the Wagyu burger was great tasting as well, the Alaskan Cod burger felt light and had a great taste to it.    The buns on the burger were soft.  Although the burger has a tall look, you can press it down to fit into your mouth.     I didn't find anything special with the Ox tail chili cheese fries.    I will get one of these burgers every time I stop by Vegas.",

No flavor, extremely bland  Chili chicken appetizer wasn't bad, but the chicken itself was dry.  Also extremely expensive for the amount of food you get.  Prices are pretty high for \"local vegas standards\".  I use to live in Vegas, and paying $10-$12 for a burger (without sides) is pretty expensive.  I can get a $12 customizable burger loaded with toppings and sauces (The Counter), or an F.O. burger in LA for the same price....I don't expect to pay this in the boondocks of Vegas/Summerlin  What I liked:  Variety, serves beer, parmesan fries  What I didn't like:  blandness of food, slow service/poor, overpriced",

    "text": "i really, really, really wanted to like this place and i did -- i just didn't love it.   first of all, let me come correct about my prejudices. i think good food is 80% good product (what did TED WILLIAMS say about hitting ?? look for a good pitch and try and do something good with it). the rest is 15% good technique (if you've seen the THOMAS KELLER video where he roasts a chicken, you know that that line blurs with genius but for us mere mortals ...) and 5% good recipes.   BACHI BURGER works pretty darn hard at getting good product. they seem very conscientious about (locally) sourcing premium ingredients -- i mean LAS VEGAS is in the middle of the desert. i believe their recipes are stellar but their execution (at least the night we were there) is mediocre at best.   other reviewers have complained about the service. ours was fairly attentive -- she did disappear toward the end of dinner and we had a bit of a time getting our check -- surprising because we came early (on a friday night) and by the time we were ready to leave the place was really filling up. but my biggest complaint was that she seemed bewildered by the menu and couldn't answer any of our questions and we had a few.   the menu was confusing -- for example the THAT's CHEESY burger under the specialty burger heading and just above the notation that all their burgers are 100% angus beef is a cheeseburger sans burger -- who knew ???   kid's GRILLED CHEESE was nasty -- no ifs, ands or buts. JULIANA and WYATT took one bite, made faces and pushed their plates aside. bad idea. bad execution. delete from menu offerings sooner than later.  the STEAMED BUNS (we had the short rib) were really interesting but a bit dry. love the idea. wish they offered a trio (duck and pork belly too) so we could have tried all three. horseradish-yuzu aioli was stiff and a surprisingly poor pairing with the beef.   the FRIES were limp. i'm sorry but fries are supposed to be crisp. the dollop of black truffle \"something\" looked like my spuds had been strafed by sea gulls in a fly by. the flavors were amazing but ...   the seemingly endless array of little dipping bowls (house made ketchup and various aiolis) got confusing and nothing was soft and creamy -- mayos really shouldn't be hard and crusty -- should they? the flavors were amazing but ...   who decided grease spattered buns toasted on a grill next to the burger are a good idea ?? they're slippery and hard to hold on to and you have to wipe your fingers every single time you pick them up. mine fell apart about half way thru the sandwich and i had finish up with a fork. the flavors were amazing but ....   house made sodas and the PORTUGUESE DOUGHNUTS and VIETNAMESE CINNAMON-COFFEE GELATO were fabulous -- no buts. well, would have preferred the gelato in one of those little bowls the aiolis come in so i wouldn't have had to chase it around my plate with a spoon but ...  my understanding is that at least one of the \"BACHI\" brothers was executive chief at ROY's -- your restaurant shouldn't be good. your restaurant should be great.   you've already done the hard part. now get to work a little harder at doing the rest.",

When the food came out there wasn't any spicy paste. I flagged down a waitress and told her there was suppose to be a spicy paste on the side but she gave me a weird look and pointed to the chili powder which I knew she was wrong. I waited till another server walked by and she knew what paste I was talking about right away. She asked the waitress who gave me the weird look to hand it to me. In which she wasn't too happy about and just left it on the table. The whole time I was observing the waitress she seem frustrated and angry as if she was having a bad day. She never once smiled and also sighed every time someone asked her something. She never checked on me again or even asked if I wanted more ice tea when my glass was empty. Btw the menu says (unlimited ice tea). Honestly the food wasn't so bad we enjoyed the ramen and burger , but she completely ruin my lunch with my girlfriend and I. The worst part is that we are out of towners and my girlfriend has been hearing great stuff about bachi burger, but from the experience with the waitress she completely spoiled our meal and we'll probably never come back. If you're a server/waitress/waiter if you're having a bad day either don't come to work or suck it up and put a smiling face on. 50% of the experience at a restaurant is the service.",

The waiter said there was going to be about a 15 minute wait and I looked around and there was a few tables opened. I got a bit confused.. but I sat down anyways.  We got seated about 10 minutes later. I did feel a bit rushed in the beginning because the waiter kept reminding us that the kitchen was going to close. BUT.... the rest of the dinner went well with service. This server was TRULY very nice and at that point, I didn't feel rushed at all. If you ever get LANCE as your server, you hit the jackpot for friendliness!!!!   On to the food,  I choose THE RONIN BURGER. Which was delightful... but it get's a bit soggy. That's my only complaint. There's just a lot of saucy stuff going on there... I put the wasabi mayo on but I actually would have preferred to have it without it. But that fried egg and juicy meat.. god, it was gold! The one thing that I really liked about the burger was the sweet hamburger bun. Not like your average bun. Light fluffy and a good compliment to all the ingrediants in the burger.  The fries were craziness. We ordered the sweet potato fries and the truffle parmasean fries. Both my new favorites...  The malasadas (portuguese donuts) were very good. They ain't no Leonard's Bakery but they were damn good with that cinammon ice cream. It was a nice ending to my already nice experience.",

The waitress seemed to be new, maybe just had the training wheels taken off, but she was very polite and was able to answer our questions.  I went with what has been dubbed \"their plain burger.\"  I thought that the meat had a great flavor to it, but what threw it off was the sweet bun that it was on.  The salt & pepper garlic fries were GREAT!!!  They even through in jalepenos(which one snuck up on me.)

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place sinec it was so close to home. But it really fell short.   Initial impression of the place was that it looked nice and very clean.   We were excited and tried the Wagyu burger and a Ronin burger. Took a while for the server to take the order but we figured it must be busy and it's ok if the food is worth it.   Sat aroung for 15 mins, looked around and some people waited for about 15 mins and still didnt get water and have orders taken. Others looked like they have been waiting for a while to get thier orders...  How long does it take to cook a hamburger, its not an elaborate meal or anything.   So food finally came and we were not impressed.  -Salt and Pepper fries: man they smelled soo good but soft, soggy fries are hard to over look expecially when they look store bought.  -Wagyu burger: the plate looked very poor in presentation, a $10 burger with the add ons should look a little nicer, a burger in the middle of a plate with nothing else looks dinky, maybe leave it open faced with side sauces or fries to fill space for presentation.  Ronin Burger: It was ok, nothing to write home to mom about, the meat tatsed the same as the Wagyu one though.   Asked for our check and took forever that to come as well. Seems like the servers take the order and just hang out at the food window instead of walk around and give refills or give any kind of service at all.   Overall, this dont not impress at all. Same price as the Burger Bar (minus the foie gras, truffles of course) but not even close to the service at all. Not worth a second try, we both agreed an In-N-Out meal would of been better and less than half price.",

    "text": "I had heard a lot about this place and everything I heard was positive so I wanted to try it.  I've gone twice and enjoyed it both times.    The main attraction here are the Asian-inspired hamburgers which fall under \"Specialty Burgers\" on their menu.  They are a little different and you will not like these if you're expecting a normal, American-style hamburger.  They do a good job of blending asian ingredients into a hamburger and the buns are a very good sweet bun.  If you want a normal, American-style burger, they do serve these as well although I have never partaken of one.  If I want a normal American burger, I will go to In N Out. You don't come to Bachi Burger seeking out something you can have anywhere which is a regular American-style burger.  You come here for something different, the Asian-inspired burgers.  The different varieties of fries they have are all very good.  I tried the Truffle Parmesan fries and the Sweet Potato fries which were both very good.  They serve them both with a special aioli.  The service I experienced on both of my visits was a mixed bag.  The main server, an asian female that I don't remember the name of, who took our order, was very good and efficient.  She was very helpful with explaining the different things on the menu while being very bright and cheerful.  The male server, who could have been the busboy, was a little slow and absent-minded refilling drinks and collecting dirty plates.  Overall, the service was good though.  I did enjoy my two meals here and the people I was with both times also enjoyed their meals.  The prices are a little high when you think you're just getting burgers but you have to remember this is a sit-down restaurant, not fast food, and they are using high-quality ingredients.  In my opinion, the prices are fair.  I would recommend trying it out.",

I ordered a burger with a fried egg on it since I had never had one before, it was so amazing I am afraid to order it from anywhere else because I don't want to be disappointed.

    "text": "I hate to be the buzz killer in the new buzzing restaurant on Yelp, but I feel I have to.  @ Jasmine Green Milk Tea w/ Boba ($3.50) - This is about the price for boba drinks if you go to a boba place. In the taste department, it was good. Nothing really special that makes them stand out like Easy Life Boba or Boba City Cafe.  @ Taro w/ Boba ($3.50) - Someone in our group got this. Taro was fine, but they said the boba wasn't cooked in the center. My boba seem fine though.  @ Truffle Parmesean Fries ($3.50) - Very good and flavorful fries, mainly because of the truffle oil. This reminds me of the awesome truffle fries at ENVY, except a lot cheaper. Probably the best fries to get out of their offerings.  @ Garlic Salt & Pepper Fries ($3.50) - Good and flavorful as well. Taste almost identical to the truffle fries, except without the truffles. Just stick with the truffle fries, you'll get a stronger better flavor. One point I have to ding them on is the cone shape containers serving the fries makings it seem like you're getting more than you really are. Cool presentation but not good for my tummy. I also noticed that someone else from the other table go more fries than us. *Shakes fist*  @ BBQ Bachi Burger American Wagyu w/ Cheese ($9 + $1 Cheese) - First bite made me say yes finally a restaurant burger worth its price, I can actually taste the difference in using quality ingredients. I should have spent the extra $3 to get an extra patty. Is there a limit to the # of patties I can get? Like can i get a 100x100 Wagyu burger (bwhaha).  @ Ronin Burger & Kiki Burger ($8 each) - The others in our group got this. One says its a lot better than the stuff at Fuddruckers. Both happy with their burger.  @ Peking Duck Steamed Buns + Pork Belly Steamed Buns ($8.50) - One person in our group decided to split the orders, so he got to try 1 of each item. This item reminds me in Vegas. Calling something Asian fusion and charging up the wazu for it. This is literally 2 buns with meat in it. Literally. You can get comparable items at Diamond bakery for a $1.25 each, a boba drink at Volcano Tea, and a banh mi sandwich at Hue Thai for a little more than the cost of this item and that would fill you up.  Sure you get a hard boiled egg and I get some salad, but thats still some crazy markup. Either charge less for this item, or give some more value for this item. This is more of an appetizer than an entree.   @ Portuguese Donuts w/ Vietnamese Cinnamon + Coffee Gelato ($4) - This is donut holes with cinnamon and a side of coffee ice cream. So Portuguese donuts is a type of donut. But WTF is Vietnamese cinnamon? The waitress said its just cinnamon and it sure is. The donuts were okay (like you have to try to make a donut taste bad), but stuff at Ronalds taste a lot better. The coffee gelato ice cream is just okay as well. I guess they wanted to take a twist on coffee and donuts.  @ Cherry Glazed Pop Tart w/ Gelato ($4) - Pop Tart? I think everyone has memories of those Kellogs Pop Tarts you toast into a toaster as a child. Well now that we're all grown up and more sophisticated, we have a restaurant pop tart. The combo of the pop tart and gelato is good. Has a good flakey crust. Definitely something to order if you don't want a coffee based desert.     Service is very friendly. They ensure that everything is good and ask if you need anything. When the kitchen got backed up, the waitress did acknowledge this and apologized.  The wait time is a little ridiculous. I don't expect fast food times, but 30 mins is a little ridiculous. Then another 20 minutes for desert. The kitchen got backed up, but how do you get backed up with only 2 table orders? I can imagine how bad it might get when this place gets filled up to a higher occupancy rate.    New restaurants are traditionally understaffed, but surprising this place seem overstaff . On a Friday night, you have 4 waitresses, with only 6 tables with patrons. Over staff at the front of the house much? It seems like there was 1 person solely just making boba drinks, but I saw the waiters making the drinks as well. Then you have another person who looks to be manning the cashier and not doing much. Then you have the overseeing owner or manager taking care of paperwork. With all of these people \"busy\", you have 2 cooks in the kitchen. Maybe they need to devote more staff to getting the food out in a timely fashion, instead of doing damage control towards its patron for the long wait.  The food is good no doubt. But pricing on some items is questionable. Just because something is Asian Fusion or you give it a fancy name, doesn't mean you can charge more for it. They have a friendly staff, but they also need to work on getting food out in a more timely fashion. A great restaurant that might have a bright future if they address some of these issues.",

    "text": "My husband and I just moved to this area of town and every time we drove by this place, we got more and more curious. I decided to read the reviews here on Yelp and since they're mostly all good, we finally stopped by a few days ago to try the food.  The people there are really nice. You can tell they're still getting used to the place since it's only been open less than a month and some aren't too sure how to describe some items on the menu but overall they're helpful, attentive and very friendly. The restaurant is very clean and the servers do a great job at keeping it clean. The wait for the food is a little long but haven't you ever heard: \"Patience is a virtue.\"? It just made the food taste even better.  We started with the Sauteed Edamame w/ Truffle Oil & Garlic - so soo addicting! I tried the Crusty Crab which was fantastic!! The crab cake patty was tender and flavorful and the mango-chutney sauce in it was perfect. I also had the Truffle-Parmesan Fries which were yummy!  My husband had the Garlic and Pepper Fries and the Kalbi Burger but with the Kimchee on the side. He absolutely loved it!! We were completely satisfied with the food and it is now one of our favorite spots to eat.  The GM came over to our table and introduced himself. His name's Guy and he is very nice! He told us a little about the place and made us feel welcome.  I also had; a Taro Boba Milk drink which is always good almost anywhere you go, and a Lychee Apple Soda which was yummy too even though I couldn't finish it cuz I was too full. I want to try all the other mixed Sodas that they make.  That was the other day.  Tonight we had: The Kiki Burger and The Banh-Mi Burger - both delicious. Can't wait to try every other item on the menu, and believe me, my husband and I will!!!",

The fries was ok, didn't try the fish sandwich, couldn't comment on it.   I was never a fan of asian fusion food - as for this place, i probably would not go back.

    "text": "After driving past this place countless times, my boyfriend and I watched the sign outside go from \"Yumburger\" to \"bachi burger\" over the course of a year. Especially after trying it's tasty neighbor, Miko Izakaya, our curiousity peaked even more. On a random Friday afternoon while on the hunt for something tasty and new to kickstart the weekend, I checked out my Yelp app to see what food-talk was blowing up and lo and behold, it was Bachi Burger.   It's an easy location to spot from the street, but the actual door can be a little tricky to find. Once inside, the simple elegance of the asian-influenced decor, homey ambience, and general mood of the place evoked a familiar feeling I couldn't quite put my finger on. I realized, after taking a look at the menu, the reason was because the food is an ingenious blend of hawaiian/asian/pacific island flavors with the never-failing, good ol' american burgers.   The burgers themselves are fantastic for all the non-typical reasons  usually makes food fantastic-in-a-weird-only-in-Vegas way. They're just the right portion, not too big and doesn't come all-you-can-eat, everything in it is made in-house, even down to the bun, and they don't skimp on ingredients to cut down on cost. Don't get me wrong, I love all those typical Vegas places too, where you can have multiple steak and egg plates for less than $10. But Bachi Burger is kind of like that special girl that comes along only once (maybe twice) in your life and you want to treat her right, where it's the quality of the experience(s) that matters most.   My boyfriend got the Kiki burger, their most popular one, and I got the Bachi Burger with ground angus. They also have a steak burger, a galbi-rib inspired burger, and a banh-mi burger to name a few of the most memorable. My burger was made to perfection, and by the look on his face and how quickly he ate it, I'm sure the Kiki burger was equally delectable.   In addition to the amazing list of burgers, there's boba drinks, exotic soda drinks, eco/trade/small business-friendly coffees, and a small but powerfully tasty army of sides, salads, and dipping sauces. Our favorite side was the parmesan fries with truffle oil with an amazing aioli dipping sauce I couldn't quite discern. We also tried the yam (aka sweet potato) fries that had a tangy dipping sauce that complemented the fries perfectly.   Also, if you're a fan of appetizers, try the chili-garlic-ginger soybeans or the fried chicken pieces.  The fried chicken was so good my boyfriend ate them so fast I hardly had time to try a bite!",

It was awesome and was promptly devoured.  Mr R ordered the Bahn Mi burger and loved it as well.  I was a bit nervous about the service and the wait as I have seen other Yelpers who weren't so happy with the service - but we were very happy with BJ who took care of us and everyone else.

The cook was wrong (one burger was a burnt hockey puck and the pork belly were sliced pieces of charcoal).  And the cook time was completely off...not only was the food was late, it was timed so badly, after one entree was delivered, the next entree didn't come out for at least 15 mins.  To make the situation worse, when the staff was asked for the manager, it took forever and the manager showed up right after the third entree delivered (another 15 mins later).   It was clear the manager's attention was elsewhere and he just wanted to be done with us.   And after he was done with us, he didn't go into the kitchen to address the cook and timing issue, he walked into the new restaurant he was working on opening.   The place needs a manager dedicated to the restaurant and not one who could care less with the old place and focused on the new place.   Terribly disappointing experience.",

The burgers are cooked perfectly, the buns are the best (I usually use that phrase in different context!), the fries come a la carte and all options are great. I would recommend trying the Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries. You'd never know it's ox tail, trust me. I wouldn't eat ox tail in any other situation but I gave these a try and almost licked the plate clean. It starts off sweet with a little kick at the end, just try it! I don't venture off too far into the options of burgers but they have Asian Fusion styles and they all look good, just not for me.   Tip - call ahead and check the wait. They have a Summerlin location that has more room if it's busy.",

Their oxtail fries were good for large groups, but it was ok also. This place is better than Gordon Ramsay's BurGR though.",

    "text": "Disappointed.  For father's day, I was really stoked to finally get to check out Bachi Burger from all the rave reviews and being '#1 Hot on Yelp' for the past last weeks now. My expectations were high from reading 4+ 5 star reviews.   Upon arrival, we parked near subway. There's apparently two different entrances? I don't know if the way we entered was the back or the front (near bathroom)? There was no sign that said anything. When we walked in, we waited for a \"host/hostess\" to seat us. What we didn't expect was for this guy who was sitting with his family at a table to get up and greet us! Was caught off guard at first. Thought that guy was a customer??   [[ Food ]]  Appetizers - the \"Chili fried chicken\" was thebomb .com! The taste of the fried chicken with the chili, ginger, and soy sauce gave it so much flavor and kick. And! the sweet potato fries was addicting.  Entrees, we had to try there famous Bachi specialty burgers, not no steamed sandwiches. I picked \"KIKI's BURGER\" because I thought the name was funny hahaha :x  it had sauteed mushrooms, caramelized bacon, and gruyere cheese. The bff ordered the \"KALBI BURGER\" - ground beef, green onions, kim chee, with Ko Chu Jang Mayo. We both shared half of each other's burger so that we can say who ordered the better burger haha! Well... both tasted okay. It was good, but was it OMG that's frickin good!? NO. That is where the disappointment came in. The bff didn't expect the Kalbi burger to be what it was, which is like any other burger, but a different bun. We expected an actual Kalbi in there or something?! In my opinion, I thought the burgers tasted the exact same, only with different condiments. To wash it down, we drank a CHERRY YUZU SODA - made with pure sugar cane. Not like the cherry pepsi or coke. More on the sweeter side with less carbonation. FYI - not part of the free refills.  [[ Restaurant ]] I'm a bit confused with the whole restaurant ambiance. Too many things going on. I think for business, it would be better if they added table booths for seating rather than just regular tables and chairs. OH! and can I say that I HATE there place mats!! Those darn things kept giving me small checkered imprints on my elbows. wth.   Overall, customer service was fair. Food was average. Food presentation needs work. Prices is not too expensive, but $8 for the \"quality\" of the burger's is pushing it. Is it worth coming back? yeah sure, everyone should go to Bachi Burger at least once. i'd probably come back later and try the others.",

We had: Truffle Parmesan Fries Peking Duck Steamed Buns (3 in an order) Kiki Burger Portuguese donuts with Vietnamese cinnamon ice cream  We started with a few craft beers which were all really good.

Often places that are super good have a particular clientele but this place has all genres. The plantation sweet tea w/pineapple and mint is the most flavorful beverage and I've tried to duplicate it at home and it's not the same. The best thing here is the oxtail fries. It's Spicey and sweet and yummy in my tummy fries w/egg and oxtail so who doesn't want that. In terms of a meal I get the non ground beef items bcus I feel some sort of way abt it but the first time I came I got the pork belly buns and they were a nice surprise. The pork is crispy and I actually like the mixture of varieties of crunch and softness. However this time I got  the Lonely Bird which was perfect. This thing seriously has a nice bun and all the flavors jus taste nice in my mouth. Anyways my friends had the Banh Mi and Mr Ho's which of course are delissshhhh. My advice go of the strip and eat and explore but clearly you are if your reading this review.",

    "text": "I thought I reviewed this place already. I mean, why wouldn't I jump to write the review on this awsome burger joint right after my experience? Must have been the food coma from this yummy food.. or perhaps the beers that followed the food... oh well.  So I stopped by Bachi Burger with some friends (party of 5) sometime in the middle of August. I was worried about the previous reviews about the service. But we had no problems. Our server was awesome! It was about 9:30p and the place was half full. I wish I remembered the name of our server, he seemed so happy and passionate about his job! And gave us recommendations and whatnot.  So we started off with the truffle fries and I got the Kiki Burger, the BF got the Ronin, and our friends got a ronin, kiki, and a traditional burger. And the bf got some kind of lemonade thing, can't remember what it was, but it was good!  Fries came out pretty quick and they were gone in less than a minute! yummy stuff. The burgers did take quite a while. But the server did come by to check on us, so at least we weren't ignored. What sucked was that our burgers didn't all come out together. So some started grubbing before others cause we were starving and didn't want the food to go cold!  LOVED the kiki burger. Something about the sweet bun, it makes the burger. The flavors lived in happy harmony. Oh and the dipping sauce, interesting flavor. They gave me the wrong sauce by accident so I got to try 2 different sauces with my burger.  Haven't been back there since but I sure hope I get the chance again soon! LOVING Bachi Burger! Though this review may seem kinda not so helpful since I can't remember the details of my visit.. but I had to say something. I need to try their whole menu..! And I am sure I won't be dissappointed. Only thing is, it's kinda pricey for just the burger with no sides... oh well!",

This wasn't a mistake by any means but I certainly felt like I could have worn jeans instead.   Parking seems pretty ample, it was busy and I still got a spot right up front. From the second I walked in the staff was polite and accommodating. Everyone said hello when we walked in, promptly sat us, and helpfully explained their unique menu. The waiter was very energetic and upbeat... which I really like when I'm having a night out.   To start, we had the Japanese pickles. Let me tell you, if you're a fan of vinegar or simply anything pickled... Get these. They were absolutely AMAZING! Our main meal consisted of the spicy miso burger (which is messy so be sure to ask for extra napkins) and (while the name escapes me currently) a rather amazing burger with home made kimchi. We cut both burgers in half and traded some so we would each enjoy both flavors. We settled on parmesan and sweet potato fries as our sides and we were not disappointed. By the end of the meal there was not one stitch of food left in sight. I even finished my sweet mango milk tea boba.   The hours of this place are great for any schedule so don't hesitate to drop by after work. If a big dinner or a late night snack isn't your forte, they have plenty of beers to suit all of your needs. While I think it would be convenient if they had a bar area, the tables are just as good a place to 'hang out'.   I can't think of a single thing about this place that didn't deserve 5 stars.   Now hurry up! Put on some pants and get a bite.",

Long story, short, FRONT OF HOUSE has gone straight down-hill.  Waited 15 mins before I went to the guy behind the cash register and asked him if there was a list to be seated.  I noted the dining room was 75% full, four tables were waiting to be bused, three were ready to be seated.  I brought this up to him, and he stated that the kitchen was backed up.  HUH?!  What the hell does that have to do with my party being recognized, and we would like to be seated?....or get on a list?....or SOMETHING other than the woes in the BACK OF HOUSE?  Only reason we waited another 15 mins to be seated, and not walk out, was because my brother was visiting, and I had been bragging about Bachi since he arrived.  Food was ok....definitely had better in previous experiences.  I reviewed the other 'Yelps', and agreed with most, if not all, of the complaints and compliments.    I wish them well, especially now that the other location has been opened.  I hope they get-it-together sooner rather than later.

After spending about 30 minutes trying to find them I was really pressed on time. Since my bf loves burgers, the only place I could think of was Bachi since it's next to his work.   We previously had a bad experience here due to the fact that they were slow as molasses, but I decided to give it another shot since I was out of options. I came in and ordered to go. The cashier said my order (2 burgers, 2 fries) will be out in 15 minutes and to my surprise it was! That was a huge difference compared to our hour wait when we dined in last time. The burgers and fries seemed to taste better too.   Bachi now has my attention. I just hope they don't eff up the next time I dine in!",

Even though there were plenty of empty tables, no one was in a rush to greet customers and seat them. Waitresses were standing around by the bar, chatting, one of them on the cell phone. Finally sat down, took a long time for someone to come over and offer to take an order. Service unfriendly, after food came, no one stopped by to ask if everything was good. Waitresses did not smile or acted like they wanted to be there. Not sure if they are underpaid or just happened to not like their jobs.  Because food is always good, will return, will try their other location. Just thought the owner should know how customers are treated. When I am paying over 12 dollars for a burger that is not even grass-fed, I hoped for better customer service.",

I've never waited more than 15 minutes here even though I was given 40+ minute wait times. Service is decent, food comes out inconsistently, we noticed tables after us got served before we did, etc. The food definitely makes up for everything bad that could ever happen here. You have to get the oxtail chili cheese fries, it is sweet and savory and the fries are so good. I would definitely recommend the Ronin and Kiki burgers. I've also tried the Miyagi-san and spicy miso burger - they don't stand out as much as the Ronin does. If you're feeling adventurous, upgrade to a wagyu patty, you can taste the difference. I love the food here and I make it a must-visit spot every time I come to Vegas.",

    "text": "To begin with I should probably mention I already had a negative bias against Bachi after having called on a Sunday and wanting to place a takeout order and being told \"No, they are not accepting take out orders Today\". Ok, of course I was wondering just what that means...they don't accept takeout orders on sundays because of the sabbath or something? Makes zero sense but whatever. So the next day I decide to give them a second shot. I call again and ask to place a takeout order. The hostess or whoever answers the phone, says she is not sure if they are not taking takeout orders and i ask WHY NOT. She says some BS about it depends on how busy they are and she will check. So I'm on hold for 2 mins while she probably figures out how to ask such a simple question to her mgr or whoever and gets on the line and tells me they'redoing takeout orders. Well praise the Lord, my trip to vegas is now complete since I get to have one of your stupendous culinary creations...not. It could be the fact that it's takeout...but I doubt it since I only had to drive less than 10 mins back to my hotel. The kiki burger was ok. The parm fries were ok. Chicken caesar was ok. Kalbi burg was ok. of course I did not eat all of these...this is based on others' input. Like I said, the initial contact often can make or break one's opinion just like in a job interview and that might have been the case here. I have no prob paying good money but I expect good food along with good service...or at least one of the two. From this Bachi, I would say i received mediocre of both. Sad to say I would not return here and rather go to KGB or one of the other high priced burg joints on the Strip even.",

After Jesse B.'s review with the awesome sweet potato fries, bachi burger has been on Dan T.'s and my list to eat. We lucked out and even convinced his parents to venture out and try this place with us. Melissa was our server tonight. She was very nice and helpful. went over everything with us and even told us a little background on bachi burger. We started with some chicken karaage, oxtail chili cheese fries (complete with a fried egg on top,) and edamame. out of all three i highly recommend the chicken karaage. so crispy and tasteful. and that sauce. i don't even know what it was but i was loving it. the oxtail chili cheese fries had jalapenos all over them, but they were not spicy whatsoever. more sweet actually. they were still good and i enjoyed them. moving onto our actual meals i ordered the lonely bird burger protein style. a chicken and turkey patty combined? I'll take it! the pesto sauce on it was quite lovely and i won't deny that i wiped that little saucer clean of it. i tried a bite of Dan's cheeseburger with bacon and was quite pleased but i will stick with my lonely bird personally. we all shared sweet potato fries and truffle parmesan fries. my choice was to order the truffle parmesan and i wasn't TOO impressed with them for the mere fact that about only 6 or 7 fries actually had the truffle sauce on them. all the others were pretty basic but still good to dip in the sun dried tomato sauce. I'd go for the sweet potato fries over those. the sweet potato's were crispy and packed with sweet potato flavor. i didn't feel the need to dip those in any of the fancy sauces. needless to say, after all that yummy food we were all too stuffed to order dessert. I will be back though to try some of those little donuts with some ice cream and maybe sneak in a coffee. I was pleased. thank you bachi burger for filling my little stomach and putting me in this food coma.",

We started with Pork Belly Buns $10 (good flavor and various ingredients) and Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11.50 (hard, dry fries with barely any oxtail meat -- pricey & over-rated)  The burgers (Miyagi-san $13, Ronin $10 and Kiki $10) were juicy and tasty, but not sure the Miyagi-san was worth the extra $3 for the wagyu meat b/c we couldn't taste a difference.  Parents loved the Bachi Fish $9.50 sandwich, so would try that if we go again.  5 burgers/sandwiches, 2 starters and no drinks = $95.74 including tax & tip, so not a bargain, but certainly worth the experience. Though the wait was long, our server was very nice and the management apologized for the long wait.",

    "text": "GREAT LOCAL FIND! Good place to eat. I love their drink selections, and their food. I'm a big fan of kimchee and beef so my favorite burger has to be the Kalbi burger. I also like the Ronin burger. I mean who doesn't love fried egg and katsu in their burger. Right? Their fries are awesome! I recomment the garlic parmesan fries are awesome. LOADED with flavor. Very garlicy and lost of parmesan in it if you like that. If you want to go for a softer tasting flavor for fries I'd say the sweet potatoes. Those go really well with the Kalbi burger. I also might suggest that you try at least ONE drink that isn't a coke or pepsi product. Their beverages are one of a kind, and tastey. So be brave! Try one of them. The feel of the place is very simple, hip, and urban. Easy enough. It doesn't have all the extra mumbo jumbo or glitz and glamour of the strip. So if you are looking for a casual place to eat with great service. Try it! I swear it is an experience!",
