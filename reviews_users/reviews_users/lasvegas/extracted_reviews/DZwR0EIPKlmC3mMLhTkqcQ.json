I was a little disappointed with their gyro sandwich and I found that their gyro bowl is a far better deal. What I mean by disappointed is the size and amount of meat in the sandwich. I ordered a grilled vegetable kabob along with the sandwich and it did not really satisfy my hunger. The kabob included 6 pieces of vegetables. I probably won't order that again.   Their gyro and shawerma bowls are the way to go. The bowls include some of the best rice I've ever had from a 'take-out' restaurant, choice of meat, Israeli salad (tomato, cucumber, onion, seasoning), plenty of fresh pita bread and a side of tzatziki sauce. Delicious!",

They really couldn't deliver as they were busy so I picked it up with my daughter.  We asked the server to double check the order to make sure everything was there. She assured us that everything was there but really rushed us out.   When we got home, we were missing many items that were listed on the receipt. We called the restaurant to alert them of the mistake and to have the missing items delivered. We where put on hold for quite some time then finally got Stephanie, the manager, on the phone whose first solution was to to credit the missing items. We had kids to feed so that was not an option. We asked Stephanie to please deliver the items to the house. She in turn said \"it'll cost you extra for delivery\". Flabbergasted, we just went to the restaurant to pick up the missing food. When we got there there was no urgency, concern or any hint of basic customer service. Very disappointing. Great food is great but great customer service tastes better. Stephano's, if you are reading this letter, you lost a customer. Hopefully you'll learn from this experience.",

The fries were good, but I really enjoyed the dipping sauce for them.  (Not sure what it was, but it does have a nice bite to it).  Service was good.  They bring the food to your table, which is nice.  While they were pretty busy, the wait wasn't too bad and the food was hot.

My friend Loren decided on this place for lunch and since I haven't had Greek food in a while, I was like, why not. I remember going to the location by UNLV and I wasn't very impressed with that spot. It's been a few years and it's a new location, so I figured I would give them a shot.   I ordered the shrimp skewer plate ($14.95). All plates come with rice, Israeli salad (cucumbers and tomatoes in a vinaigrette) and pita and hummus. I'm trying to limit the amount of carbs and sugar I eat, so I opted for no rice and to substitute it with salad. Easy suggestion right? So guess what comes out? I get rice after I specifically said NO rice. The Israeli salad has been substituted for regular salad. That's not what I wanted!!!!!!! The girl offered to change it, but I know what happens to food when you send it back, so I just ate it in disappointment. The shrimp was a little too charred for my taste. I ate the rest of my food except for the huge pile of rice. And to pay $16 for food that I didn't even finish was kind of a bummer. I tried to give you another chance Stephanos, but I just can't like you.   P.S. The baklava was good though. That's the reason for the 3 star and not 2. Moist and not too sweet!",

What I can comment on it the food: it was delicious. I am so happy that they offer a low carb option and I am, frankly, happy to pay the price because the helpings are extremely generous and the Stephano's meat and Israeli salad are as good as it gets for me.   Thanks for offering this option. I will definitely be eating more low carb Stephano's in the future.",

I love Greek food and on a curious night I decided to try Stephano's with my boyfriend. We each ordered the beef & lamb gyro, which comes with hummus and Israeli salad. The portion was huge, for me at least. First bite, we both looked at each other, eyes wide, with a smirk of pure satisfaction on our faces. The meat was perfectly seasoned, didn't have to add any salt to it. The pita was warm and soft, the lettuce and feta just added extra texture to the whole thing. We decided that Stephano's was going to be our only place for Greek.   I usually only order the gyro, but yet another curious night, I ordered the grilled shrimp plate. OH MY GOODNESS! Words could not describe how amazing that plate was! Shrimp was cooked to perfection. They give you 10 shrimps, not the small ones either. The Greek rice.. ROUND OF APPLAUSE! It was so good I had to ask the manager what type of rice they used. He told me how it was made and I complimented how great they are! I definitely recommend the gyro and shrimp plate to anyone! You will not regret coming here.  Service is phenomenal! Every time I go here the cashiers or manager are so nice. They are super friendly and knowledgeable with their food. They also always give me some type of sample of their new desserts. My first time there, the cashier gave me a free order of fries and drink to go along with my meal. Just because. They're just super friendly. They are obviously all about customer service. And for that they gained me and my boyfriend as regulars :)  PS- Do NOT forget to ask for the garlic sauce, for all you garlic addicts, like myself.",

It comes with a side of tzatziki sauce as well. I highly recommend Stephano's and if you're pressed for time, they have delivery as well as online ordering.

They have the real deal carved off the spit here- no pre packaged frozen slices. The rest of the sandwich fixings were fine. They serve it with plenty of sliced onions and tomatoes. The tzatziki sauce was the real deal too- no ranch dressing like some places put on their gyros thank goodness. The only downside was they served it on a pita that was soggy on one side. Looked like they toasted it on the inside but the outside was soggy and stuck to the foil wrap and my fingers.   The fries were hot and crispy but I did not like them. They serve the kind of fries that have some kind of crispy coating on them that give the fries sort of a light breaded texture, not just cut potatoes.   I ordered to go, but while I was waiting I noted the restaurant is small, but nice. Clean and new with a few tables and a couple of TV's on the walls.  The service is where you order at the register then you get your own soft drink. They also have a nice selection of bottled beers. Your meal is brought out to your table by an employee when it is ready.   I'll probably go back for a gyros sandwich once in a while as it was above average but I'll pass on the fries.",

We liked how their menu had pictures as well as descriptions. They did bring food to our table which was nice. I got the spinach pie plate. Came with spanikopita, two dolmas, hummus and tomotato with cucumber and onion salad. It was soooo much food but it was all really good. The seasoning on the dolmas was the best I've had in town as spiced it up, the spanikopita was nice as actual pie not those silly triangles people claim are spinach pie. The hummus was seasoned well and the salad was a nice touch. It's nice how they have wheat or white pita options as well. My friends got the gyro combo and the falafel combo and they both loved their food. They got fries and loved how they were seasoned. The falafel she hadn't had since Europe and was quite impressed. The kids all got dessert. Rice pudding they liked but the hit was the warm NUTELLA and pita! They couldn't get enough of it! Nutella in a Greek joint... Definitely a hit for kids!  We all enjoyed and are definitely going back!  The only reason not five stars is there were 7 of us and we had to sit separately as no table for more than four and some other tables were taken so it wouldn't have been possible to move tables together. It also therefore was crowded at the table for four once the food came.",

I ordered a Gyro after drinking for a bit (yeah that 151 was rough....) and honestly, it was the best Gyro I have ever had. On numerous occasions I've ordered Gyro's in the past and they just didn't taste fresh. Whether it was the vegetables, the meat, the flatbread etc. Here? Everything was fresh and hot. The lamb was amazing. And the portion is a good side.   The decoration is pretty good. They have TV's and the diner has a very rustic charm to it. They also serve beer and wine so you can get that fix if you want.   Price was about 8 bucks per Gyro so it's a little pricey but you can taste the quality. Better to spend an extra 3$ on something that's done right than be a cheap skate and get a average to meh Gyro.   The only downside is that it's a little small in the inside but you should be able to get a seat. Overall it's a great little place to check out.",

I got here at 8:40, 20 minutes before they close which isn't unreasonable. I love the food here but this whole situation is really bad service.   Update: just got my food as I was writing this (chicken kabob rice bowl). I haven't received this before but it's about the size of a kids meal for $11? Only 1 skewer of chicken and barley any rice or salad. Maybe they skimped because they want me to leave? Very upsetting overall.",

Then actually lied to  Henderson Police Department stating the charges would be refunded, which NEVER happened either. Not really understanding why they lied to HPD but that should show you what kind of \"Business Owners\" we're dealing with. I was a frequent customer at Stephanos and order the same thing every time. This LUNCH order was approximately $28.00 (Salad, Gyro and Delivery). All they had to do was correct my order, but they couldn't even do that. Instead it was an argument. They're food is good but severely OVERPRICED!! It's fast Mediterranean food with restaurant prices. This location in particular does bad business!! Again all they had to do was make it right and correct a $28.00 lunch order for a frequent customer!!",

I've had this spot bookmarked for awhile and I finally grabbed some takeout last weekend. The restaurant is in the same shopping center as the Smith's grocery store tucked in the same corner as the Baskin Robbins.  There were several items on the menu that appealed to me, but I narrowed to the Kofta Plate to go. I also used the Yelp check in offer for free Baklava. The meal ended up being enough for two servings so I had dinner that night and lunch the next day.  The Kofta was excellent in flavor and texture. The rice looked simple, but had great flavor. The Israeli Salad was fresh, but had more tang than I expected. The hummus was tasty, but a bit chunkier than most hummus I've ever. It's personal preference, but I like my hummus more creamy. The pita bread was nice and soft. The Baklava was great and some of the best I've had.   My to go order didn't take more than five minutes to be prepared and was priced fairly. I liked the food and would definitely return if I was in the area. This restaurant would be a five star in most towns, but Vegas has serious Mediterranean food competition.",

Both the beef swarma and beef/lamb gyro meat were delicious.  The hummus was tasty and went well with the wheat peta bread that we ordered with it.  The rice bowls were more ideal for my picky tweenagers, although they could've used a little more meat.  Also picked up a small plate of their baklava and it is the best baklava I have ever had. The whole family enjoyed their meals. We will definitely be back",

My \"boss\" had never been here but I've been to the location near unlv so I suggested we try this one together.  It's a little different setup then the other location I've been to. I'm not sure why but when I get to the register to order, I'm always overwhelmed with the options. This location at least has pictures of the plates but that still doesn't seem like enough. Everything kind of looks the same in the pictures and the descriptions are long so when I feel the person behind me breathing down the back of my neck, it gets a little frustrating trying to decide if you don't already know what you want. It's almost like it should be a server type restaurant with seating and menus.  Here's the catch though...I've been here several times and whatever I order is good so maybe it doesn't even really matter what I choose. I just feel like there are different things I would like to try but I don't really have the time to look. I don't even really know what I order because I just point and pay. And that seems fine.  Which comes to the only other thing to discuss, the price. It is a lot of food with lunch box type plate meaning you get a little of everything but it costs like a sit down server type restaurant averaging around $13-$17 per plate. Very worth the price though but be hungry because it's a lot for one sitting.   I'm happy with this place but I'm just giving my review of what I notice and what other might read.",

They have a very extensive menu form plates to wraps to bowls. I always find myself ordering the gyro bowl which comes with rice, gyro, Israeli salad and a choice of wheat or regular pita. I love the salad which has great dressing on it and always go with the wheat pita, which has a nice sweet taste to it.   I've also tried their seasoned fries and special sauce and it's delicious. The fries are a wonderful crisp and the sauce is just nommmm.  It's located in the same plaza as Smith's, Starbucks, Baskin Robbins and Robertos so there is ample parking!  Oh, and if you order before 3pm, they include a drink with all of their meals!",

This way, menu perusal is easy, you can be out of the way of the line *and* there is no giant menu taking away from the gorgeous decor! Well done, Stephano's!  I continue to think that the gyro bowl is the cat's pajamas. SO stinkin' good! I keep meaning to try something else, but I just can't go without the warm pita, tangy tzatziki, succulent meat, amazing salad and that rice! I have dreams about that rice. It's a ton of food and will likely fill the belly of even the hungriest person.   Stephano's has earned itself a top spot in the dinner-out rotation!",

The reason I'm writing this review just because this place stands out as absolutely awesome. I've been all over the world including the Middle East and their salads tastes exactly like my wife's mother salad who was born and raised in Cairo. The chicken shwarma is absolutely the best I've had in Vegas it's fresh soft and crunchy it's truly the best chicken shawerma I've had. The gyro was great. the bread is fresh and soft it's basically 5 out of 5 stars . You get great service ,very nice people ,good price , and fantastic  food. if you're looking for a a gyro,  or sawarma or Middle Eastern stuff this place is clean and delicious. Extensive menu  grilled meat,  sides. This place ROCKS! !!!",

Staff member said..what did I order. I told her...she said it normally takes 10 minutes or so because I ordered a kabob..I said then why is my food not done...if it's almost been 30 minutes.....she apologized and still did not bring the kabob out with or order...she said they forgot I would have given a 1 star but the food was not that bad.....",

You get a good amount and will have leftovers. Bring an appetite and prepare to see what all the hype is about.   My advice: get a Shawerma plate. I like the Chicken Shawerma with a side of rice, hummus and the Israeli salad. I always order extra Tzatziki sauce as it's delicious and always fresh. I also recommend the 1/2 chicken plate, gyro plate, kabob's etc. They have delicious large Greek salads for the vegetarians out there. The Baklava is AMAZING! Makes for a great dessert and I suggest you splurge and try it. Really never had a bad meal here. It always hits the spot.   I usually eat here 1-2 times a week. Been eating here for years. Used to order it daily at my office when I worked near their UNLV location. Have not gotten sick of it yet. Don't expect that I will. They are good people and know me personally by this point. They take great care of their guests and feed us well.   It's without hesitation that I recommend Stefano's to anyone looking for a delicious meal. You can thank me later, after you get out of your food coma.",

There were so many fries in the container i had to have my son help me eat them and we still didnt finish. They were pretty good with just the right amount of cheese. Gyro sandwich was good, i thought the meat was charred in a few places and wasn't as tender as i would have liked. Meal with a drink ran me about $13.00.

The second time, I had the gyro and French fries.  Overall, I'd say this review is maybe a 3.5 stars.  I can't go up to 4, but it certainly is better than 3.  Solid fries (thin and crispy), and good sauce.  My main issue that prevents me from bumping Stephano's up to 4 stars is the grilling of the gyro meat.  Not every place does this, and in some bites, it's FANTASTIC.  I love that flame kissed taste.  But, in a lot of places, really more often that not, it was overly cooked on the grill.  This results in a black and \"charcoaly\" taste and mouth feel.  It was these bites that I did not care for, and each time I had a lot of these bites.    The fry sauce has a nice tang to it, it's not just ketchup and mayo mixed.  It's probably the best fry sauce I've had.  I also like the special during lunch wherein they give you a free drink if you order a sandwich and side.  I've taken advantage of this both times I ate at Stephano's.    The check in offer is a small piece of baklava, which was fantastic.  It was the perfect size to finish the meal, and was very moist and sweet.  It was a great representation of baklava.  Overall, I understand why this place is so popular.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable and service is friendly and prompt.  But, the grilling is too aggressive for me and what should be a benefit ends up overwhelming the entire meal.",

    "text": "After getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist, I checked out the Yelp app and found this place for dinner. It's located in a strip mall surrounded by crappy fast food restaurants. The inside is clean and spacious -- at least when it's completely empty it feels big. I went with the tri-tip shwarma which came with a salad full of chick peas, cucumbers and other deliciousness. There was also some hummus and pita with it. I loved the flavor of the steak, especially the crispy edges. There was plenty of spices and seasoning on it.  My kid went with the kid's pizza. It's actually just a pita topped with sauce and cheese. Good in concept, but not execution. It was a soggy mess and my kid barely ate it. Next time I'll just get him some chicken.  Prices were decent, staff was friendly and willing to help out a first timer there. If this place was closer to me I'd probably be a regular.",

    "text": "I used to visit Stephano's all the time when I was on UNLV campus regularly. For four years, this location has allowed me to continue to frequent without the travel time. The strength for me has always been their consistency with fresh, made to order protein with portions large enough to leave me satisfied every time.  I have yet to try the lamb shank, but I've had the chicken and the shrimp which are pretty standard. My go-to is either the filet or the beef/lamb gyro meat. The beef is always tender and the roasted gyro meat is sliced with each order and seasoned just right to bring out the flavor of the meat. The wrap is the easiest way to eat your protein and usually the method of my preference, but you can also have your protein in a plate, salad, or in a rice bowl, which is what I had last. An order of hummus, Israeli salad, rice, and your choice of white or wheat pita comes with the plates.  Ordering is typical fast casual where you'll be given a number and the food will be brought out to you if you're dining inside or at one of the tables outdoor. Wait times are typically around ten minutes so order online or call it in if you're pressed for time. Expect prices right around $$/person obviously depending on what you order. Make sure you get your free order of baklava with check in.  Service is usually pretty friendly and accurate with the exception of our last visit when the young gentleman, who was a younger one of the family members that run the restaurant, seemed to be in a rush with everything causing him to make mistakes left and right. I don't know which train he had to catch but when I ordered at the counter he asked, \"is that it?\" after everything I said. Even though he took our order, he no recollection of it whatsoever when he delivered it not repeating the items we were receiving, dropping it off, and just leaving not asking if we needed anything else. When we looked at the order it wasn't ours and after bringing the order back to have it corrected, the young man was on the phone fumbling through receipts obviously doing damage control on another order he screwed up. Everything was rectified and our food was delicious, just be on the lookout for this kid.",

Granted it wasn't busy and he was probably just bored, it was a breath of fresh air to have such customer service rather than looking at a bunch of bored coworkers standing around! Props young man!",

I got the lamb and beef gyro. So good! Sometimes gyros are so full that it's really hard to eat. But this gyro had a good ratio. It's definitely something that I'm going to just crave.  My boyfriend got the lamb and gyro plate. There was so much food and well worth the money. They fill the plate with meat. He loved it! He was a little hesitant at eating Mediterranean because he doesn't love it but he loved this food!   We also shared some feta fries. It was good, but I didn't love it. I think after a couple of bites, I wished it was just regular fries. It was just kind of hard to eat with the melted cheese cause it congeals, so I ended up cutting the cheese with a knife.   I'm a huge fan, and will definitely be back!",

I've only had chicken when I've been here.  More specifically, the Chicken Kabob plate.  It comes with pita, your choice of wheat or white, Israeli salad, hummus, and rice with 2 kabobs of chicken that is SO flavorful and delish!    If you like garlic you HAVE TO get the garlic sauce with your meal.  It has a similar consistency to butter but it is AMAZING.    Also, with your check in you get a free baklava.    Today they had a special where with any entree, appetizer, or plate you get a free drink.   The food is still top notch and if you have a love of Mediterranean food this is definitely a go to!",

We have been coming here over a recommendation from a friend. We've loved the gyros and pitas and were never disappointed with whatever meal we had.   Once we moved, we started getting more delivery to make life easier. That's when we started having crappy service. Whomever is the dude taking delivery orders is short, doesn't listen well, and likes to argue instead of find a solution. We tried to order online to avoid the call tonight and once again the website was broken. We had an item missing and onions on our gyros when we said no onions. When I called to get it corrected, the same guy just argued with me and told me that's not what my husband said (I was right there when we called) and so I said if there was no resolution we just won't order from them again. His response: \"okay.\" He didn't offer to deliver our missing items or to make anything right.   Bummer, cuz the food rocks. So, if you don't mind below par service but good food, this is the place!",

I am going to compare Stephano's to Great Greek because it has set the bar for me.   I feel like the chicken shawarma greek salad was good, but didn't quite measure up to the salads at the Great Greek. The great greek's salad is loaded with feta cheese, olives, tomatoes, etc. Stephano's also put them in their salad, but it seems a bit lacking in comparison. In addition, the fries here aren't quite as amazing as the feta fries at the Great Greek. The pita bread here are also a bit smaller and stiffer. Meat quality seems to be pretty good and I have no complaints there. Overall, I feel like Great Greek has more flavor in their dish than Stephano's. I honestly can't place my finger on what it is, but it is just a tad bit better.   In my book, Stephano's is a close second to Great Greek. I will always opt to go to the Great Greek over this spot, but if I happen to be in the area or if Great Greek is closed for the day, I would be more than happy to come here. I highly suggest that you try both places and then make your own judgement call.",

To our surprise there was a lunch special, free drink with purchase of wrap or plate before 3pm, yippee (my first time at this location)! The young man working as cashier was friendly as was the rest of the staff. They were accommodating with my friends' order with substitutions. I ordered my usual beef/lamb gyro and an order of large fries, with yelp check in I was also able to get free baklava. As always their food tasted great and those fries and sauce is to die for.  Not oily and have a great crunch and seasoned to perfection. Yum, just thinking back as I write this review is making me drool . This location is smaller than the UNLV and their SW location, but sat my group of 8 comfortably at their largest table.   Wouldn't mind coming back to this location if I was in the Henderson area. I was too hungry and forgot to take any photos",

Had a subtle flavor to it... maybe chicken broth and butter but it was definitely the best rice pilaf I've had. -tri tip shwarma: this is my favorite dish here! I ate it with some yogurt sauce and it was the best thing I did all day!  Tri tip was flavorful and tender. MUST TRY! -Beef kefta kebab: this too had a good flavor  My friend's picky 2 year old actually ate the food! She was a big fan as well.",

I'm a big chicken kabob guy, I get that dish first anytime I try a new place like this. And after eating here for the first time, I've been back 3 others to get the same dish!!!! It's very good, nice portion sizes and great taste. I order mine with rice, you can get French fries, salads, and other items if you want to. Chicken and rice works for me. They also have lunch specials, can't remember the exact times, but it's a good deal. Your order comes with a fountain soda. So it saves a few bucks.  Overall the place is good, clean, friendly, and doesn't break the bank.  Everyone seems to enjoy the food, there busy every time I've been there, so they must be doing something right!!!!",

I get the filet mignon kabobs, and they are cooked perfectly every single time (medium rare inside).  I've also tried shrimp and chicken, they're amazing too. The amount of food lasts me two servings, they definitely don't skimp. The wheat pita bread is really good, and so is the israeli salad. They have an orange-ish fry sauce that I like to dip everything in. They offer a low-carb option for their meals, which is double meat and no rice. That's 4 huge kabobs!  Overall, the food is fantastic, but so is their service. They always tell me delivery will be 45 minutes to an hour, I always have my food in half an hour. It arrives hot and the delivery guy is really nice. They earn every one of their 5 stars!",

The Israeli salad is pretty lazy, just cubed veggies in dressing. Would be much more palatable if it was sliced , just to give the impression it's not gruel. The meat options chicken swarms and gyro was average with tons of salt. But 46 bucks??? Service was pretty slow took 18 minutes to get these out to us with 3 other people sitting in the resturant. The great greek is definitely worth the drive to save on cash and get alot more return on taste and service.",

He was very helpful in our lunch choices all with a friendly personality.     I decided on the beef and lamb gyro with the feta fries on the side.  The gyro was great.  It is definitely packed full.  The meat had a great flavor! The mound of feta fries were too much to handle.  They were good but a little different with the sprinkled oregano all over the top.   I would have liked them better without the oregano but not too bad.    With the Yelp check in, you received a free baklava.  It was absolutely perfect. It is a small piece but after the portion size of their lunch you don't need anymore than that.    I am pleased to find another Greek restaurant with great food.  Thank you Stephano's!",

You order up front and get a number.   The food costs over $10 which is very expensive for this type of meal. The portion size is fine for 1 person and most plates come with hummus, puta, israeli salad, rice, and then meat of choice.   I tried falafel and chicken and both stood up to fast food cuisine of this type but it didn't really blow me away in any aspect of the meal.  Worth a try but I think there's better alternatives for Greek food in town.",

I should have remembered that even though this is a strip mall store front restaurant, it's not exactly Fast food, they cook some items to order which tastes fantastic, but it takes a while.   Today, I ordered the Filet Mignon Kebob plate.  This comes with 2 filet skewers, rice pilaf, hummus, warm pita (white or wheat), and a cucumber tomato salad.  At $14.95, it may seem a little pricy for lunch, but it's more than enough to share.  The steak is melt in your mouth tender, the rice is fluffy and flavorful (they make it with chicken broth), the hummus is creamy and has a nice lemon/garlic flavor, and the cucumber tomato salad is crunchy with a good vinegar bite in the dressing.  The pita is very good, but it's a brand you can buy in the store, so it does not need much description.  I also bought a box of Wedding Cookies for $9.99 to take home.  They were good, but a little dry.",

    "text": "I'd read some reviews of Stephano's before but never really had it on my list. I was going to cruise up Eastern to Silverado Ranch or Richmar for lunch today, but since I was in the very immediate vicinity of this place, I popped inside to look at the menu. Noting that the various pita wraps are mostly priced at $6.95, I went for the beef and lamb gyro on a wheat pita and used the Yelp check-in for a free baklava (normally $0.99).  The wheat is perhaps the first thing you'll notice when you take a bite. It's a bit of a sweet taste and different from a regular pita, and it has a pre-made feel. Some may not like it, but I didn't mind too much. Then you'll realize that there's a very generous amount of meat, up to six slices of not-so-thin gyro meat in my wrap. I was pleased since I honestly didn't expect that much meat. The tzatziki sauce isn't as special, but it's vital for the creaminess and bit of sourness. Tomatoes and onions complete the experience with some texture and acidity. I thought that the overall flavor profile was balanced and tasty, but not especially daring with the spices. It's a safe gyro choice and a solid lunch portion.  The baklava is a fairly small triangle. It's a very honey-ful pastry of phyllo layers with pistachio, and it's advertised as being made from scratch daily. Perhaps that's what gave it the softness that I don't normally get from baklava. I'd say that the baklava is definitely above average as far as these things go.  I probably won't be drawn back here very often due to its remoteness from me, along with the presence of other Greek places nearer to my neighborhood, but I think it's worth a shot if you're in the area. Grab a couple of wraps or a plate-sized portion of whatever appeals to you.",

    "text": "I happened upon this place when my kids were wanting Subway and I was looking for something different.  It is great if you avoid bread, like me, because you can get a double meat plate and it makes it a lower carb meal.    Since my first visit I have been back twice.  There is a lot of food on the plate, so I tend to share with my kids or bring home food for later.  It is easy to over order and I thought it was a bit pricey at first, but there was so much food that it became more than one meal.  Everything we have had there has been excellent!  The location is deceiving.  It is near many \"fast food\" choices like Subway, Starbucks, etc.  but really, this is \"sit down restaurant\" quality food.",

The Baba Ganoosh was rich & creamy or eggplant and garlic, served with two warm pitas.. YUM..  The  Keba ball is kind of like cooked Kibbee.. flavorful meat on the inside with a seasoned breading on the outside and then fried.....  So good, I ordered another one to go...

At this point they are already 30 to 45 min later than they said they would deliver, so we decided to cancel our order and just go to a local bar, the reason as to why they don't even deserve a star is the rude customer service and the fact they have our phone number and did not decide to call us and tell us they were running late l, instead we called twice well after the estimated delivery time and still did nothing to provid customer service or apologize for being so late, I used to eat here atleast 2 to 3 times a month, but after this I will not even consider them again",

Fifth, the atmosphere is mixed...the windows are covered with written advertisements like a fast food place, but the inside is like a mall food court. We had to wait until we received our food to get napkins (the cashier had disappeared and they weren't readily available). I would have given only 1 star, but it takes someone intentionally making the experience miserable and someone getting sick for me to give only 1 star. Basically, we definitely will not return, far better options elsewhere.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places to eat. It's the perfect place to go if you want to sit down and have a nice lunch and take your time, or in somewhat of a hurry and want a fast food type of lunch without the fast food quality of drive throughs. The food does take a little longer to come out, but that's because it's extremely fresh and cooked while you wait. I also love the staff at the locations, they are always super friendly and you can tell that they care about the food. The hummus is amazing, it has a great flavor seeing that the hummus at other Greek restaurants tend to be bland and taste the same. The Feta fries are also incredible as well but my go to is the chicken kabobs- they're always juicy and never dried out, which is usually the problem when I get chicken from places that grill it there themselves. It's clean, the price point isn't bad for the amount of food that you're getting. Great food!",

Didn't get the combo with the fries and drink because I felt it might be too much food. I was right - there was a lot of meat, too much, in my opinion anyway. Although it (the meat) was very well seasoned, there were a few too chewy pieces and a lot of the tahini sauce which made the pita bread soggy. The Chicken Kebab Plate that my husband ordered was okay, nothing extraordinary. The hummus was good, though. Will I be back? Maybe, maybe not. I could give them another try but for me, there is definitely a better Greek Mediterranean place than Stephano's. Sorry :(",

Tried this place for the free baklava and it was fairly close to my apt. I ordered the combination chicken and kofta kabob. The chicken was juicy and tender while the kofta was dry and tasted like it was sitting out for awhile. The rice that came with my meal was dry and undercooked. Maybe I came on an off day?  I liked the garlic sauce and the baklava was tasty so I will be back to try them out again hopefully ill have a better experience next time!",

I ordered the cheese gyro and unfortunately was disappointed. Mind you, this is just my preference, you may think I'm nuts, and that's ok. I love feta. And their portion was generous. Too generous. Feta is a strong flavor which overpowered everything else. I was unable to taste the tsaziki on its own. I would have like more sliced onion and some shredded lettuce. The meat was thick but a tad salty for me. The girl at the register seemed very busy, maybe stressed out, as she wasn't particularly friendly or inviting. That never feels good to a customer. Maybe I'll try another gyro without the cheese on another day.",

In addition we ordered some Greek fries and an appetizer of the tzatziki and pita bread.  Figured the tzatziki can be a dipping sauce for our steak and some of the extra pita for the hummus would be great. So the order arrived fairly quickly. The steak and shrimp were good, the rice was decent and so was the hummus. The pita bread was hard. The Greek fries were cold and soggy. The cheese on the fries had hardened up and made just one solid mass of goup. The separate chicken skewer was WAY over cooked. It was black and hard and completely dried out. The tzatziki sauce never arrived. So all in all, could've been ALOT better, but could've been worse too I guess, hence the 3 stars.",

The portions were alot smaller than the one we used to go to and im not sure if it was because we came later in the evening but most of my husbands chicken was burned ends. Luckily he likes that sort of thing. But for $12 a plate for fast food it should be what you like. Still on the fence may try this location again at an earlier time.",

They have whole wheat pita, which is silly, as you'll never find that in Greece, but I guess so close to California, you have to do what you have to do. (Don't get me started on whole wheat pasta -- sham. No one in Italia will eat that!)  But the product is good, tasty, and well made.   The Greek salad is Americanized with lettuce, which is a shame, but the taste is good.  The Israeli salad is very good, too.   The baklava, which you get one free piece with check in, is excellent.   Now...if they only had Greek Frappe!",

And make sure to get the garlic sauce for the chicken because it is sooo good. The reason I gave 4 stars out of 5 is because a couple pieces of the chicken seemed to be pretty chewy.

Not a good low carb option. However, I went with two chicken skewers and a veggie skewer a la carte . Same 12 bucks and not a carb in sight. The chicken was moist and tender. The veggies were grilled perfectly. A lot of food for a lunch. But good eating. If I'm in the area, I will definitely return for a very informal fast lunch.",

When I walked in, there were two ladies ahead of me and they took forever. They were unable to make up their  minds and the girl behind the register was having trouble putting in the order.   After placing my order, the girl asked me again what rice I had ordered and when she handed me the water cups she stuck her fingers on the inside of the cup. I could tell she had not been trained on common sanitary procedures. Also everything about her and the process of placing my order was extremely slow.  As soon as the tray was put down on the table I saw that the side of pita was burnt. Also, the pita containing the gyros meat was drenched in grease. The gyros meat was tasty as usual and both sides were good enough. However, I am not a huge fan of their hummus because it is has zero flavor. The baklava's phyllo dough was also dry.   Stephano's is a great Greek fast casual alternative to Daphne's Greek Cafe that serves artificially tasting Greek food. The food also comes relatively quickly no matter how busy they are and the food is consistent.",

Now that they are open* next to my house in Henderson, I am looking forward to having one of their unique beer selections not found in many other local places. (*they told me on their soft opening that the beer will be available later in February).   Best of luck to Stephano, Nick and the crew in Henderson!!

In fact, I would say that this place is healthier than most Greek (gyro) places as well. Also the baklava here is SO delicious!!! Even if you're not really into sweets at all, please try a piece of the blaklava (it's $1). I come here every couple months or so and I'm never disappointed. You guys are amazing!!!",

Recieved the order in around 10 min, they even included exta sauce without me even  asking. Thumbs up for that. The dinning room and kitchen are very clean, you can see the whole kitchen area. Food was great, meat was tasty and flavorful. Portion size was big I was stuffed, but it was so good. Frys were great if you like crispy frys, which I do. All around great food and service definitely A+ establishment",

We also tried some complimentary pickled turnip that was nothing if it wasn't colorful.  The gyros were pretty good though the pita was from a package and there was a wee bit too much grilled onion and a wee too little tzatziki sauce. I am not sure if this mini chain has deteriorated or we caught them on an off night, but our experience in the past at the UNLV location was much better.",

Everything was so fulfilling.

My food came out about 7-10 minutes later. The gyro was wonderful. The pita was warm, soft, and chewy and the sauce, meat, and everything else were on point. Could not have asked for a better gyro and a decent portion size too. The fries were also excellent. Crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. A major bonus was the fry sauce they served with the meal. Super delicious.   No doubt I will be back. The overall experience was very good.

My husband and I ordered our meals at the counter and took our seats.  When my meal was served, I was disappointed.  I assumed that I had ordered the wrong thing.  Just five falafels (non-meat balls) on a bed of lettuce with fresh tomato and raw white onion slices.  Not even pita bread to put them in, even though I had been asked if I wanted white or wheat pita bread when I placed my order.  I returned to the counter and asked for the pita bread.  A different cashier told me that my meal didn't come with pita bread, so I bought some for $1.08.    I was about done eating when Jennifer approached us with a receipt, cash and a meal in a to-go container.  When she heard me inquire about the pita bread that either did or did not come with my meal (Schroedinger's cat??), she did a little investigating and discovered that I had been served the wrong dish; I did not get what I ordered; I did not get what I had paid for.  Accordingly, Jennifer refunded the cost of my meal.  (Not of my husband's, which is fair.  He got what he ordered and he ate and enjoyed it.)  She also refunded me the $1.08 for the pita bread.  She brought me the meal that I had thought I'd ordered; the meal that I actually wanted.  It was EXACTLY what I wanted.  I had already eaten, so she put a lid on my meal; gave me more pita bread and wrapped everything into a nice large plastic bag to enjoy for my dinner this evening.  She didn't charge me for the meal, as an apology for the inconvenience.  Now THAT is customer service.  Because of that, I fully intend to return to Stephano's, and will eat there more often.  Until that happened, I had already said \"I don't think I'll be coming back here for a while.  I didn't want a bunch of balls of food on lettuce.\"  My husband's order came with french fries which were very tasty and crisp!  Best fries we've had in a long while; we hate limp fries.  When you 'check in' to Facebook from Stephano's, you get free baklava.  So I will have a nice Mediterranean meal tonight, complete with baklava for dessert.  Thank you, Jennifer, for turning our not-too-great lunch experience around.  I hope management appreciates the job you do.",

I ordered a meal:  beef shawarma, steak kabob, hummus, baba ghanoush, rice, and received a free piece of baklava for Yelp check in.  The wait time for the food was reasonable.  There is one t.v., and a small beverage and condiment section near the registers, dining area, and bathroom facilities.  The pickled turnips were good (never had them before).  They no longer have the Lamb Shank on the menu, which is fine by me because the last time I had it at a location on the West side it left much to be desired.  Hoping they'll eventually consider adding lamb chops to the menu.  Overall the food was very good; the rice being a tad too salty for my taste.  I would return.",

My constant companion ordered a gyro and I ordered the chicken kebab plate. My plate came with 2 skewers of chicken, rice, hummus, salad and your choice of white or wheat pita... AND a small cup of garlic sauce. I don't know what they put in that cup besides the obvious garlic, but I have thought about it almost daily since that first taste... when I fell in love. I have thought about the different items I could put it on: steak, pork, fish, eggs, bread - the list could be endless.  The chicken was delicious even without the sauce. I enjoyed the wheat pita and the salad was very tasty too. The rice and hummus were good, I think the plate was too much for an average appetite. I think it would be the perfect sharing size for an elderly couple. The service was outstanding. The lady at the counter was very helpful in answering our questions and she is generous with her genuine smiles. This cozy eatery is one of my new favorites and I try to think of reasons to go to that part of town just to partake of that delicious chicken kebab plate with the amazing garlic sauce. Coke Zero is served here also.  Enjoy!",

The restaurant was about 75% full with a good stream of people ordering to-go.  The layout flowed well and they had a open kitchen to the dining room only separated by plexiglass.  Service was great!!  Young lady at the register was friendly and provided suggestions for a 1st timer.  The food was pretty good.  I got the chicken gyro wrap and a shrimp skewer.  Food can out in about 12 minutes with a busy restaurant.  There were 2 cooks, expo/food runner and cashier.  Well staffed for the size of the restaurant.  I would definitely recommend to try this place if you like Greek and Mediterranean food.",

It was buy one get one half off, so I tried the chicken and the beef. Well, after YEARS of the best at Stephano's, I was so disappointed in the other place, I have taken a vow that from this day forward, I will always be True to Stephano's. The food NEVER disappoints, the garlic sauce is amazing, the hummus,  pita bread, rice pudding, the Moussaka, baba ghanoush, baklava, Stephano's grandmother's rice recipe are all wonderful! Even the Ultimate Grilled cheese is savory and delicious. I pray Stephano forgives my fall from grace! I promise, it will never ever happen again. Stephano's your my one True Greek love!",

    "text": "Pretty good first impression- the chicken kabob plate was very filling and had some unique surprising flavors. It came with two generous kabob sticks and a garlic dipping sauce on the side. I was very skeptical because the garlic \"sauce\" looked more like a garlic paste and I didn't want to scare off all the vampires in the immediate las vegas area. However once I gave it a try, I couldn't stop eating it. It does have a very strong garlic punch, however it complimented the chicken perfectly. I found myself constantly going back to the dipping paste for more. The kabobs came on a bed of \"rice pilaf\" - which was just white rice that was very fluffy, but nothing extraordinary. The Israeli salad was nice a refreshing- a good mixture of bit size pieces of cucumber and tomato. It was a nice compliment to the chicken. The place also came with a generous helping of hummus- however with all the garlic partying in my mouth, I couldn't really discern much with the hummus. They do offer wheat or white pita bread and I think I found that I don't care for the wheat bread much- just stick to the regular white pita.  And check in on yelp! You'll earn yourself a complimentary piece of Baklava cake- just perfect. Buttery and nutty and just a perfect way to end your Greek fest!",

I got a whole mess of food to bring back to a family lunch when I was in the area. It came to about 90 bucks.  What I liked right away is there are low carb options so that is great for Atkins and diabetics, dieters etc. Always nice to have an option. They even have a large meat platter you can get. So I ordered that, no one liked the smaller bits of meat, I forget what it was called... but the other pieces were nice.  ( I decided to just try out a whole mess of different items, great way to find out which are your favorites).  The desserts looked tiny, as in bite size. They were cheap too. So good if you just want a bite but are watching your waistline too.  To us the Salad was very grassy tasting and not very crisp, but that is just about personal choice in lettuce preference. It might be the ideal salad for someone who actually wants some greens and not ice burg lettuce.  The rice was just rice, I wasn't disappointed or impressed. The casserole dishes needed some help. They were small for the price with way too much cheese. The staff were fine, I got helped to the car with the bags.   Considering the choices on Eastern Ave, this is a better bet than most,  but if I really want amazing Greek food I'll keep going to my favorite the Great Greek on Warm Springs.  So this is a good review, the place is mentionable. One just needs to know a little bit about the menu to work it to your best advantage and preferences.",

So at least for $30 it will be so delicious that I wont care that I am cheap.    But in the end, meh, it was just ok.... Will never eat here again.  Super bummed.  I think $5.00 is a tough sell when its just for one person.",

I am biased when it comes to falafel as I have a great place I go to in California where I live but every time I am out here I make it a point to get their falafel and the great thing was with their lunch special I could get the falafel as a side to the chicken schawarma sandwich! The only problem I had was the garlic sauce was a little runny but other than that I will definitely keep coming back!",

    "text": "Stopped by for a quick lunch during their soft opening this weekend. I knew right away I was in for a treat when I saw a couple of their upright gyro rotisserie grills grilling up the meats. Also what caught my attention was that they offer low carb items in their menu and also your choice of wheat pita bread. Love healthier choices!   Ordered the Beef & Lamb Gyro sandwich which I upgraded to a combo that included an appetizer and drink. Great deal for under ten dollars.  Meat was seasoned nicely and real tender, pita bread soft, and the tzatziki sauce in it was outstanding. . Love the generous portion of Hummus that I chose for my appetizer as well. Also got to try a sample of salad and baklava. All I have to say is I'm happy that we have another authentic Greek restaurant in the area. Everything is fresh and definitely made from scratch.  Casual dining area.. there is enough seating to handle a busy lunch crowd ..order at counter and they bring your food out to you. Service is helpful and friendly.  Big plus they are open early for breakfast and also will have a breakfast menu.  Their menu has some of my Greek favorites Pasticcio and Moussaka! Even a Vegetarian version of it! So I'm looking forward to trying out more dishes from here so I can update this review. I bet then I can bump it up to five stars! Find this place in the Smith's strip mall near the coffee shop.",

The decor is much more conventional. None of the comfier seating options like they have at their Maryland location. But since I'm here to eat and not lounge around, it's not of concern to me. It's not a small space, but I can see them needing more seating once word gets around about their new place.  It's a friendly and efficient you order and they bring you your food type of arrangement. We ordered the Lamb Shank plate and the Chicken Kabob plate. Both plates came with delicious hummus, pitas, Israeli salad and rice. The lamb shank was accompanied by sauce covered mushrooms and carrots. Delicious. The chicken kabob was served with some kind of SCRUMPTIOUS garlicky butter. It was like cocaine in butter form.  There are many very good Greek restaurants in the area, some even closer to my home, but none of those have the variety of foods that Stephano's has. Definitely a good deal on really good tasting food. You won't regret giving them a try.",

    "text": "The Skinny: decent eats for very reasonable prices... kudos on the garlic sauce (I love toum!) (3) counter service: pretty friendly and quick (3) value: plates are large and filling and provide good value (3).  We've been on a Mediterranean bent lately. After a lengthy doctor's appointment, the hubs and I decided to hit Stephano's for a quick fast casual tuck in.  I got the chicken shawarma combo plate (with a side of toum - or delicious garlic sauce) while the hubs got the gyros combo plate. We came during lunch hours, so we each got a free drink! Sweet!   They have a small selection of fountain drinks available. The hubs got some unsweetened ice tea while I just got some water with lemon. The drink station also sports some self-service pickles as well as fresh slices of lemon to go with your meal.  The combo plate comes with a sizable portion of hummus and Israelis salad and two slices of pita bread. At $11.93, these plates really fill you up! When I got my plate, there was a huge amount of meat on there. The amount of meat on the hubs gyros plate could have easily made up two sandwiches.  Both meats were caramelized off the spit and kind of grilled again to give it that charred flavor which I love. The beef/lamb gyro meat however was a bit blander for me and could have used a bit more spices. The chicken shawarma was a tinge too salty but when mixed in with other things, it was okay.  The Israeli salad was okay and perhaps a little over marinated the time I went. The hummus, although filling, didn't have enough lemony bite to it and was only okay in my books. The toum (or garlic sauce) is great! Would have asked for some more because it totally reminds me of the awesome Mediterranean joints in Dearborn, MI. The tzaziki was okay - nothing spectacular. The baklava was pretty generic so I would probably pass on that.  It's basically a counter service joint but the food is prepared to order and tastes pretty fresh. Prices for the amount of food is very reasonable and the staff is pretty friendly despite us taking a few minutes to decide what we wanted(they have a pretty big menu). I wouldn't necessarily make a trip out here specifically to eat at this joint but if I was in the area and felt like Mediterranean, I'd certain give it another go.",

They greet you as soon as you walk into the door. Their menus are located near the entrance or you can walk up to the register to order. It can be quite busy during lunch time but they're quick with orders. Once it's placed, they'll give you a number to take to your seat.   I've gotten a few things from the menu. My favorite is any of the rice bowls. It's usually enough food for at least two meals for me. Comes with a soda too. The Israeli salad is amazing and the tzatziki sauce is to die for!

We got to Stephano's around 7:30PM and since they were going to close at 8PM we decided to get our orders to go. So this review is mainly about the food, although I can say that the cashier was pretty personable and the staff seemed pretty attentive. The interior of the restaurant is like a mix of sit down and fast food. In other words you order like you would at a Wahoo's, pay, they give you a table marker, you find your own seating, and someone from the staff finds you and drops off your food when it's ready. Interior looked clean and spacious.  Anyways here's what we ordered and what we thought: -Chicken Shawerma Plate - The chicken was good and tender. It was seasoned and had a hint of curry or something similar. Rice pilaf was standard issue nothing to write home about. The Israeli Salad reminded me of Mexican salsa except that it was more tangy and not spicy. I thought it was okay The hummus was....???....it was hummus. I'm not a big fan of hummus so I didn't really finish most of it. I'm sure if you're a tree hugging, yoga practicing, avocado toast eating person then this hummus was the bee's knees. (What does that even mean? Do bees have knees? If they do what's so awesome about them that warrants a saying after them?) Wheat pita bread tasted like a thick tortilla.  -Beef and Lamb Gyro - This plate was identical in components as the Chicken Swarma plate with the difference being the meat. My girl said the beef and lamb were tasty. Seasoned well, moist, and not tough. She thought it was a good selection. Like me she wasn't a big fan of hummus even though she likes avocado toast. Go figure?  -Half Chicken Plate - Again the side items were the same as the Chicken Shawerma, but the chicken was actually the bone-in grilled pieces. The chicken tasted fine, but I would say the grilled chicken from El Pollo Loco tastes better, grilled better, and has a better flavor in the seasoning department.  -Baklava - This pastry wasn't bad. Pretty sweet. Had some flavors that reminded me of pecans? It came free since we used the Yelp check-in. The baklava reminded me of the pastries you'd eat with coffee at fancy-smancy places that have doilies under the tea cup plates. Speaking of tea cup plates what was the point of the tea cup plate? You pour in some milk or sugar into your tea/coffee, stir the mixture around then take out the spoon and set it on the plate? Just leave in the cup like a real American!   Anyways I'm getting off track...  The meals came with Tzatziki sauce which was tangy and white. Also Garlic Sauce which was a blend of garlic and olive oil. I really enjoyed this garlic sauce and had it with the chicken. It help make the chicken more garlic-y and flavorful.  Overall I thought the food was A-Okay, not terrible, but I can't honestly say I'm a fan. Keep in mind I'm not a real Greek & Mediterranean food connoisseur so I probably didn't do the food justice by fully appreciating all the subtle flavors and textures. Check it out if you are a Greek foodie and like hummus since the place might be up your alley.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FIpFJ4WxspDc&s=543405e6d135f2d797b0b7adb87f0ddb5bb8969145c5fffa9da551714e3f1cf3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/IpFJ4WxspDc</a>",

His gyro was also slightly not filled. Dry too.  Fries were overcooked and warm not hot and crispy. Also, when a server passed by with a tray of fries they were filled up. Ours were about a little halfway filled.  Waited a while for the food as well.  It was okay. Not great.",

I like hummus as much as the next guy, but I'm not going to eat it with a spoon. I live 20 minutes away from the restaurant. When I called to ask what they could do, they apologized and offered to give me \"free\" pita (which I already paid and tipped for) if I drove back to the restaurant. There is no way in hell that I want to spend 40 minutes of my time to deal with a mistake that a restaurant made, while my meal gets cold. They refused to offer any other type of recompense for their mistake. To be clear, I know that mistakes happen, especially in the restaurant industry. I likely would have been happy with an apology and offer for some type of discount on a future purchase. I USED TO BE a semi-regular customer, because even though it's expensive for Mediterranean, its decent and it's on the way home... This terrible customer service decision has caused Stefano's to lose a customer.",

    "text": "Yesterday for lunch, I meant to get pizza. as I left the office, I made the wrong turn. as I made my way back and kept driving down Eastern, I realized I didn't know where the make-your-own pizza restaurant was. So I pulled into the parking lot trying to figure out where to go for lunch when I saw the sign for Stephano's.   Because I went to lunch a little after 12, the restaurant was a little busy.  I waited a few seconds at the counter which is good because this was my first visit. From the distance in the kitchen, I heard, \"thank you for coming, I'll be there in a minute.\"  I waved back to acknowledge that I heard her.   So I decided on the chicken shawarma gyro combo. I'm Not an expert on Greek food but I do think the gyro was tasty. I always thought gyros came with lettuce in it, but mine only contained tomatoes. Which is fine because my gyro was loaded with chicken. Because my gyro was really hot when it first arrived, I started off with the seasoned fries and dipping it into the special sauce it came with. Not sure if the sauce was for the season fries or gyro but it was really good.   While looking around, it seems like the employees enjoy working there but maybe a little too much as I did see the cook throw a wrapped gyro across the kitchen for the runner to bag for a take out order.  at least it wasn't mine.   I thought the restaurant was nice and clean, great variety of menu options, and good prices. Look forward to my next visit.",

Upon looking at places I came across Stephano's...so happy I decided to go with them! Absolutely great food and very generous portions!! Plus they came & set up and brought paper goods which really made life easier! To top it off, the catering prices are great compared to anything else you can get that's delivered straight to your room. Maria helped me with all the details and I was very pleased with everything. A million thanks!! I will definitely stop by when we return to Vegas!",

    "text": "Stephano's is my latest addiction.   If the government ever outlawed mediterranean food I'd be like Bubbles from the Wire, walking the streets of Las Vegas looking for a hit of Gyro to \"scratch the itch\".   Thankfully it hasn't come to that and I can instead legally swing by Stephano's every few days (sometimes daily, it's come to that before) for a fix before the withdrawal symptoms set in.  I've tried several menu items.  My favorite overall item is probably just the gyro rice bowl.   It's basically a bowl of rice with several pieces of gyro meat and a small side of israeli salad (which always consists of seemingly fresh tomatoes and cucumbers) and some pita bread (white or wheat).   I think the portion size is perfect with the rice bowls as opposed to the plates which should only be used for feeding large families.   Okay that's a lie as I still from time to time will order a plate because really the food is so good I always want more even when I finish.   That's probably a medical disorder that I just admitted to you all, but I like these reviews to have that extra special personal touch to them.    The plates are a little more expensive, and are loaded with more meat, more rice, more everything essentially and some hummus to boot!   I can highly recommend the gyro plate, and also tried one of the mixed skewer plates with chicken and lamb, and everything was great.   On occasion I also will just get a straight up gyro or the \"cheese gyro\" which is the same but with feta.   Stephano's makes an excellent version of this classic.  The gyro meat, obviously the driving force, is always tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  They don't skimp on the meat either.  I usually get an order of feta fries with those, and don't be fooled by the order sizes of \"small\" or \"large\".    The small is large and the large is unconscionable.  Even if you're sharing with another, the small will do.     The only item I've ordered that I wasn't a huge fan of was the chicken shawerma wrap.   I found the mix of tahini and garlic sauce to be overpowering and the chicken was overcooked.  It may have just been a one-time thing, but I haven't tried it again.   The other items that I mentioned above have more than made up for it.   I can safely say that if you stick with the dark meat, you'll be okay (someone less civilized than I could make a joke about Kim Kardashian here)  So whether you're jonesin' for falafel or just out for a one-time recreational usage of Tzatziki, let Stephano's be your pusher.",

The meat is perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection.  You don't have to add anything to it.  The portion is also good.  I always have extra for the next meal/day.  The baklava is amazing!  I ordered the 1/2 tray back in December and finished them before my relatives visisted of out of town.  I was so loyal that they gave me the Punchcard without me asking for it.  I have never considered myself a fan of Greek's food until I found this place  I strongly recommend this place before you go elsewhere.  You will not regret your money and time with this place.  Cons:  I tried to the location by UNLV twice in the last month and I wasn't impressed with it at all.  The lentil rice was dry, hard, and stuck together; and the portion was much smaller.  The only plus side is that the UNLV location offers teacher's discount - you get free soft drink with your order.",

    "text": "They should name another Greek Goddess Stephano!! I was really impressed with the food at Stephanos. I even came back second time just make sure not dreaming or delirious. Lol! Really the thing that stood out for me was just about the whole experience from the five star service, food, and great atmosphere dine in. My first visit tagging along with another first timer Suzy H. I went with the beef and lamb gyro plate, Talk about HUGE portion size. I was like really dam this is awesome!! Once I digging in every component was delicious! Hummus has always been measuring stick comes to Mediterranean food for me. The Hummus was spot on awesome. The consistency was perfect, tasted fresh made, and my meaning  fresh creamy texture, thick, use fresh garbanzo beans start with not ones out of can. (Trust me had bad Hummus nothing worst), The israeli salad is bomb comes to side salad. Talk about refreshing! It basically diced cucumbers and tomatoes but the vinaigrette or whatever dressing tossed in brings it all together. Light, refreshing, healthy, and perfect compliment with the plates. The gyro meat was tasty. It had great flavor could eat the meat by itself or with tzatziki sauce. You get decent size portion of meat. The pita bread was hate say it again but tasty stuff. You have option of white or wheat. Pita stands out is nice thick bread not flat or thin pita bread. So really perfect bread load up anyway heart desires, and you never need to worry about the bread falling apart on you. Awesome plate for lunch!!!   The second visit tried one of the bowls this time tri=tip shawerma bowl. Talk about portion size! It was loaded with tri-tip, israeli salad, and rice. All the same things that stood out the first time did again the second time.   Some little things that enjoyed about Stephano. Lunch specials plate or bowl get free drink. Surprising cause not many places know that offer free drink with any meal. No silly not talking alcohol but fountain drink. In the fountain area couple pickled options that can take as much as you want. I like the jalapeno. Warning it thick cut your one pieces does the trick for me. Another tasted like daikon or something white match stick cut pink in color. Not fan. I think great option they also offer for free.   The service the gentlemen working the counter great job explaining everything for first timers, friendly, and great service.   The dining area not all that big. Still nice relaxing atmosphere on top of fact it open kitchen so if need entertainment watch your food being made to order.   Great value for your price. Great service. Awesome food! What else is there to justify five star review. LOL!!",

    "text": "Ordered the lamb leg, & gyro.   The lamb leg was soooooo good. the portion size was huge, and the meat just fell off the bone. It tasted like it had been roasting & slow cooking for hours. The person I was with did away with the polite pretense of cutting the meat off the bone with a fork & knife and instead just ripped at it like a dog... It was that good.   My gyro was fine, pretty standard, and satisfied my craving for Mediterranean food. Generous portions of meat and it came with two Pitas. I'm used to my gyros having more veggies in it, so the little slices of tomato were fine, but not what I was expecting. My meal came with tsatiziki and tahini.   The store was clean, had a self serve pickle-like-stuff station, & self serve drinks.    It's an interesting set up because its very casual (order at a counter, food is brought out to you, you bus your own table), but it sometimes felt like their method of preparing food would be better served as a formal sit down restaurant. For example, their prices were a bit higher than what you'd expect from a \"fast food\" place, but once you taste it you understand why. And their service was a bit slow, we waited about fifteen to twenty minutes before getting our food. The longish wait for a fast food place is not an issue considering how awesome that lamb was, just wish I knew what to expect before going. Now that I know, I won't go there if I'm in a hurry, but will definitely make time for it now.",

    "text": "Geeked for Greek!  Five stars? Yeah, I'm just as surprised as you. The food is an easy four stars and the helpful service pushed it into the five star realm. Ordering takeout can be hit or miss, I mean who doesn't like their food fresh and hot. Stephano's was a definite hit with piping hot meats for my mouth.   I ordered the Beef and Lamb Gyro meal. This came with sliced gyro, onions, tzatziki sauce, hummus, Israeli salad, and a carb fueled mountain of pita bread. The Gyro meat was juicy and cut thick which is a nice change from normal gyro cuts. The menu says it comes with two pieces of pita bread, but they gave me at least five pieces of soft pillow love.   The pita bread was soft, but durable and made for the perfect meat holding pocket. What's a pita pocket without all the fixn's? That's where the Israeli salad and hummus come into play. The hummus was creamy and worked as great edible seal to hold in the fresh Israeli salad.   This type of salad isn't the leafy green type you're thinking about, this salad is made of tomatoes, parsley, onions, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, and salt. Which is almost like Greek salsa and it's delish! You can tell theirs is made daily because the veggies still have that crunch - Five star fast Greek food all the way!  PRO TIP: Free Baklava with check-in!",

Food came out quickly and was incredibly flavorful, tasted fresh and homemade (there is a difference!). I checked in and got the baclava for free, walked out with a dozen because we loved it so much.   We went early, it was pretty busy but they moved quickly. When we left there was a line to order with tables filling up. It's an open kitchen which is always a good sign, looked clean and everyone was working really hard.   Also, they have beer and wine. Bottle of the Greek lager was $3.75 and wine (plastic glass but tasted good) was $5.50, definitely one of the more affordable places to have drinks with a meal.",

My one exception to the deep-fried is the feta fries, and yes, you must get them! Don't skip this!!  We like to call ahead and have it ready for pick-up. Easy to get to, and they have a rewards program where they remember your order and preferences.  They're good about modifications and substitutions, but they have forgotten our pita bread on multiple occasions. They still get 5-stars though.",

The steak was super tender and flavorful, and I was super surprised at how flavorful and juicy the chicken was as well! No dry hunks of meat here (like at other \"kabob\" places I've been to). The plate came with hummus, pita, a Mediterranean salad, and some rice as well. I ate twice off of this one plate, and I believe I paid around $10-12 (sorry I forgot the exact amount). If you're looking for a quick Mediterranean spot, definitely check it out!",

    "text": "Our usual Greek place we go to  in Henderson is closed on Sundays.  We got a craving for Greek food that day and decided to try Stephano's based on Yelp reviews.  Sadly, it did not compare to the reviews on Yelp.  Maybe it was a bad night.  Maybe it was at the end of a holiday weekend and the food was just running thin (two items we ordered turned out to be unavailable and substitutions and refunds needed to be made).  Or maybe we have just had better food and our expectations have been raised.  We ordered the whole chicken, the beef and lamb gyro plate, a side of baba ganoush, a rice pudding and a grilled tomato.  After ordering and paying for the meal, I was told that they were out of the grilled tomato and that they were out of the dark meat parts of the whole chicken.  They credited my account for the tomato and offered all white meat for the whole chicken . . . in other words 4 breasts with wing and no leg/thighs.  Well . . .the chickens breasts while seasoned nicely, they were terribly dry.  The beef lamb gyro meat was also dry and the edges were burnt.  The tzaziki was runny and tasted more like a ranch dip. And the rice pudding while it tasted OK, was a super small portion for $2.49.  On the rice pudding.  The usual Greek place we go to charges $3.49 for their version . . .but it is 4 to 6 times as large.  It also does taste better.  So . . .here is the summary of Pros and Cons  Pros: Hummus is quite tasty baba ganoush is also quite tasty large amount of pitas included  Cons: Slow service - took 30 minutes to get food after order Chicken dry Beef/Lamb dry, burnt and too much pepper Israeli salad is horrible and over seasoned / marinated Rice pudding while tasting ok, it is a VERY small portion Food overall salty requiring water during the night We still taste the food 12 hours after eating it (NOT GOOD)  In conclusion, I think we will keep our urges for Greek food away from Sundays and stick to our usual place also here in Henderson.  We really wanted to like you and were sad.  In fact, all three of us stated that if this was our 1st experience of Greek food, we would never order it again.",

I decided to try them again tonight (haven't ordered from them in awhile after a delivery mishap) and I am so disappointed. We always order the same thing, 2 chicken shawerma salads and an order of fries. The salads came with no dressing and the fries were unbelievably salty and soggy. What happened guys? I will not be going back and also recommending to my family a few other Greek restaurants. I just paid $35 for salads with no dressing and fries that are too salty to eat. They raised their prices but lowered their standards :(",

Not oily, not dry, perfect. And the feta fries, good call Ron! I was stuffed then I heard about the nutella pita they have for dessert. It was bomb!

Josh said he'd already eaten there two days in a row for lunch, but was game to eat there twice in one day, it was that good. I was just looking forward to spanakopita and baklava, which I assume every Greek place has. Much like the Great Greek and Greek Bistro, Stephano's is more of a casual establishment where you order at the counter and then your food is brought to you.  I chose the Vegetarian Combo and had water, a $13.50 meal and a bargain when I saw the amount of food that was brought to me a few minutes later.  Hummus, two stuffed grape leaves, wheat pita bread, spinach pie, tabbouleh, and falafel--great goodness me!  It was definitely a combo.  I was disappointed in the spinach pie--flat, a little overbaked, and more phyllo than spinach. The rest of the food was good and I couldn't finish everything. Then, one of the employees brought a platter of baklava to the table and gave us each a piece for free--score!  THEN, Anna gave me her piece--double score!!  Josh ate his--whatever.  All in all, it was a pleasant way to end the Hallmark Holiday and I'd eat there again.",

I just got the gyro combo, my wife got the gyro with cheese, and my daughter got the grilled cheese.  Quite good!  Combo portions are pretty generous!  If anything my wife says the gyro with cheese could have used more cheese.  She's a cheese lover haha",

    "text": "I have never had a bad meal there.  Yesterday Nov 19 my wife and I stopped in and ordered a beef and lamb gyro and a chicken gyro.  After I ordered we sat down.  After 25 minutes passed I went to the front register and told the apparent manager how long we had been waiting.  I was met with a deer in the headlights look.  I then proceeded to ask for a refund as a lady next to me said she was waiting for 30 min for her food also.  One of the staff in the back heard our complaint and rushed to bring our order out.  The manager then said,  \"no don't give it to them, they cancelled their order.\"  I was a little shocked by this but not really surprised by the initial reaction I got from the manager.  This should not have happened as at least 4 customers who ordered after us got their food within 5 minutes of placing their order.  It is not like it was busy as it was 2:10 pm when we ordered.  They had 1 person working the register and 3 or 4 in back working the food line.  It should not take almost 30 minutes to make 2 gyros.  Like I said, I have never had a bad meal there. Yesterday, I just never got a meal there.  Looks like I will be getting my gyro fix somewhere else unless something changes.",

There were four other girls behind the counter, goofing around and not one asked if I needed help. As I started to observe what they were doing, they were holding trays of dessert. I believe it was the baklava. They put the trays down and now imagine you were going to take a bite of something, but didn't. These girls put their mouths to the food to \"pretend\" to take a bite and the other girl was taking pictures w her iPhone. DISGUSTING!!!!!!! People are going to eat this food that you've now had your breath on. I didn't want to make a scene in the restaurant so when I left I called and asked for a manager. Selena was the manager and I asked if she was just up at the front or was in the back. She said she was in the back. So I explained what I witnessed and she said \"I don't think they would handle the food like that.\" Hi Selena, welcome to the convo because I JUST saw this with my own eyes and suggested she watch cameras if they have. I told her I would never be back because of this incident and Selena could of cared less. For a worker to put their mouths close to any food that anyone is going to eat is beyond disgusting and never mind a health code violation. NEVER, EVER AGAIN! I give this place zero stars!",

So... it was like getting 2 meals in 1.  Always a nice thing.  Service was \"mixed\". The cashier was nice and friendly and walked us through his favorites when we asked. But the kitchen seemed to have issues... we waited a really long time for our dinner.  A couple people who ordered after us were done with their dinners and left before we even received ours. The cashier gave us free baklava in exchange for having to wait.  So, we had dessert before dinner.  The baklava was not overly sweet but the phyllo dough was really thick and a bit dry. So, it wasn't my favorite but being free... I ate it. The beef/lamb gyro was juicy and tasty. The veggie kabob I ordered had a nice flavorful grill on it and the veggies were fresh and not overcooked... not undercooked... cooked just right.  I'll be back to try more of the menu. But I'll try to go at a less busy time of the day.",

We got the chicken shawarma and beef & lamb gyro plates as well as the lamb shank rice bowl. It was so much food! Everything was delicious. They give you a big serving of hummus and salad with the plates. I've had gyros in Greektown of Chicago a handful of times and I'd say the meat is comparable, if that helps at all.  Because I checked in, we got free baklava and I don't know if it usually comes in two's but they gave us two baklavas cut in half since we had four people. I was honestly expecting just one but it was nice that they did that. :)",

    "text": "I've been here a dozen times and that says a lot for being new in town.  My husband and I like to try a variety of cuisine and good Mediterranean food can be hard to find.    What looks like a chain restaurant, with a huge menu, is surprisingly a really great place to dine in.  They must cook everything fresh, because even ordering meat off the spit, can take awhile.  Don't expect a quick dine-in experience, because they're always busy with take-out orders, even if the restaurant appears to be half empty.  Trust me, it's with the wait.   The chicken kabob is super tender and flavorful with the obvious choice of being the healthiest option if you're opting for a diet meal.  They have filet mignon served as steak kabobs and they are out of this world tender with really great marinade.  The lamb/beef gyro off the spit is usually high in sodium, but always satisfying.  The tri tip steak, though a little tougher than the filet, is still thinly sliced and makes stuffing my pita into a sandwich even more satisfying.    They offer wheat pita bread and the tzaziki sauce along with their garlic spread is the best combination when smothering my meat in those sauces.  Though their pita bread is packaged, I do appreciate the fact that they make it a point to offer both white and wheat pita bread.    Their cucumber salad is refreshing and has a bit of a kick to it.  Their rice is pretty good, as I could taste that it's cooked in chicken broth.    Some of the stuff may be a bit generic, but overall, you can beat the price for the quality and quantity of food here.  I appreciate the coupons in the mail that offers 50% off and free drinks for most of their meals during lunch hours everyday.  Yelp check-in offers a free baklava, but I'll pass on that honey filled pastry that just taste like sugar overload.",

It's a small place within a crowded plaza with several other food options, but this place is worth fighting for parking for!  Like I said already, Stephano's is small...it's got several tables inside and one or two outside, with an open kitchen that you can see right into. The menu is pretty big (and so are the portions), with sandwiches, salads, rice bowls, and meals (as if everything else isn't a meal??). I've had the gyro rice bowl and I love it! It comes with rice, gyro meat and a tomato/cucumber salad. You can get other meats instead of gyro, but I love me some gyro meat! The bowl comes with white or wheat pita, which I found the white pita to taste too doughy and under cooked. The wheat pita was delicious, but also a bit too doughy. Certain times of day, the bowls and salads come with a drink...get the iced tea! It's delicious!!!  The staff has always been professional & courteous, though I wouldn't really go so far as to say that they're friendly. The service is quick and you can be in and out pretty fast if you're on a deadline (not as fast as an actual fast food restaurant...everything here is made to order).   Stephano's is tasty overall and definitely recommended!",

We've been going their since the day they opened...5-6 years ago and even had the place cater for us a few times. Everything was amazing and prepared with love and fresh ingredients.  The recipes have changed and its more Lebanese then Greek. I am not saying its bad, just different, cheaper meats, bread and different spices and now very salty.  Their shawarma meat use to be made daily and grilled extra to order - now its boiled and mushy with onions....way different. The Gyro meat is also the standard cheap product that can be bought at any place, food truck or sidewalk cart...just bland and nothing special.  I hope the new owners are smart and go back to the original \"owners\" recipes, otherwise they will not last on the super competitive Eastern Blvd.  Advice - don't lie about your new ownership, embrace it and i hope you take this feedback and move forward and stay special as Eastern Blvd needs a great greek restaurant.

Their chicken is moist and very tasty! They also have great hummus and their rice is quite amazing. I could live on chicken and rice as long as it's done well. When you check in you can get a free baklava, and their baklava is also very good. Comes in pretty small pieces but it is worth it, it almost reminds me of a flaky gooey cinnamon twist from great buns bakery, if you've ever tried that. Everything I have had from Stephano's has been exceptional in my eyes, that means a lot coming from someone who isn't a huge Greek food lover. It can be a little pricey and take a while but it is worth it.",

    "text": "Came here usually to pick up food ordered online since its so close to the hospital.   The most recent visit, we had an order of 5 items consisting of 3 Beef & Lamb Gyro plates and 2 Beef & Lamb Gyro salads. Stood in line for a few minutes with a few people in front of me but was fairly quick.   When I had told the cashier the name for my order, the cashier had gave me a small bag. Knowing my order I had opened the bag to check, and it was filled with wrapped pita bread, dressing and tzatziki sauce, and utensils. I asked the cashier where the rest of my order was and she saw the other bag with 5 plates. She told me they usually label on receipt on bag stating there are multiple bags but I guess it didn't this time. I decided to open that bag (omg why do they double tie it... HARD TO UNTIE !) to check the order. 3 normal gyro plates, 1 normal gyro salad, 1 gyro salad without feta cheese and dressing. Had to check the \"special\" one as the one who ordered it is very particular and I didn't want him to be mad LOL... Luckily enough, the order was made right and I left  As a student in the past at UNLV, I had dined at Stephanos many times for their gyro bowl which I had recently got at the SW location too. My friend had suggested the gyro plate and to make the order easier, I had opt'ed for that as well.   When I got my plate.. WAO THERES A LOT OF FOOD ! lots of gyro meat, a large amount of hummus, a good amount of Israeli salad consisting tomatoes, and 4 pieces of pita bread.   For only a $3 difference between a plate and bowl... DEFINITELY worth getting a plate. You get much less meat and don't even get hummus when you get a bowl. It was so good ! love gyro meat ! Wiped the hummus up clean with pita bread. Suffered from FOOD COMA right after.... LOL still wasn't enough to hold that alcohol I drank later ... .dot dot dot xD",

The chicken is mouth watering, well cooked just the way I like it, and goes perfectly with the white rice. The pita bread was big and tasted really good dipped in the cucumber sauce. The salad was good but i can't have that much spicy foods so I wasn't able to eat much of it, but my boyfriend did. Lol. We will be going again real soon! Thank you!",

We went in for lunch because I was craving Mediterranean food and I was THRILLED to see the sign for this place, and right away the staff was friendly and helpful. I wish j would have asked the girls name who took our order, but she was cool and very hospitable.   Then I went to check in on yelp (about five minutes into waiting for our food when I see that you get a FRWW BAKLAVA for checking in!!! Omg.) I RAN up to the counter. The girl laughed pleasantly (understanding my plight entirely) and said \"here's an extra piece for your boyfriend too\") what an angel!! I mean, I have been at TONS of places that won't give you the check in bonus if you check in after you buy your food. I can't even tell you how many times. But this girl, she was so sweet and didn't think twice about making our day.   She then went on to tell us about the other locations in town and I will say this: I am now hooked. And it is because of her. I hope she reads this and I hope she knows it is about her because people that provide amazing guest service are the type of people that make this industry great. (She was young, brown hair, ponytail/messy bun, brunette, and a great smile)   I know robots are supposedly going to take over the food service industry, but you would be hard pressed to find a WALL-E who could make your day like this girl did. You simply cannot program human warmth  hospitality.   I don't know how your pay structure works, but if you are the owner or manager, she deserves a raise. If it helps (to search for the check) we ordered a gyro plate to share (which she was so helpful in describing and was honest with us about how much food it was) and we got two drinks. I got an iced tea and he got a coke/Pepsi. I am a 28 year old blonde lady (thin, 5'6'' with my hair in a bun) and my boyfriend is also blonde (clean shaven, 6'0'', not heavy, but with a belly for sure) hopefully the girl working will remember us. Oh! I pointed to the baklava and I asked \"what is this called again?? I am drawing a total blank\" and she answered me with kindness and eagerness. :)   Anyway I really hope this doesn't fall on deaf ears because this experience really was a great one.   There aren't many times in life (especially as you get older) where you get to be wholly shocked by the authentic kindness of an individual, so when it happens, you remember.   I remember you, brunette young lady with the great smile who gave us the extra baklava. You are awesome. Keep it up!!",

However, the service was simply unacceptable.   We ordered a meal for 9 people and when picking it up it seemed as though some wasn't present but we were assured that all items were in the bags. After a 15 minute drive back home, an entire meal and side order was missing.   My wife called to see what could be done to correct the situation and asked if someone could deliver the missing items. The manager  (Stephanie) actually said  (this still shocks me) \"Yes, but that will be a $3 charge.\"  Rather than not only offering to deliver the items for free  (which would go without saying) and likely offering to put in an extra side (a fairly standard practice to make sure the customer understands that you are aware that a mistake is made and want to keep their business), she actually said we would have to pay for delivery.   My wife opted to go pick it up (15 minute drive) and when she arrived they had completely forgotten who she was and had to search for the bag with the items.   Mistakes happen, it is how a company deals with it that matters. And Stephanos fell flat on their face and I will not be opening my wallet to them again.",

I have no idea what that tangy fry sauce is but it's great make sure you have it.  The only thing that kept them from getting a full five stars was their super rude delivery driver. The restaurant charges a $3 delivery charge and I tipped the driver an additional $2. Being that my order was only $10 adding an additional $5 was more than generous. However the driver didn't see it that way and made sure my entire office including our clients heard his displeasure.  Way unprofessional and that would stop our office from ordering from them again ever.",

For entrees I had the chicken souvlaki wrap on a wheat pita and my other half had a shrimp kabob salad. They offer free drinks with any wraps or gyros and also we received free baklava for checking in on Yelp!   It was quite a long wait (around 20 minutes) as everything is prepared fresh and it was the busy lunch hour. I highly recommend ordering by phone or online before arriving. Now for the food:  The baba ganoush was just ok. Comparing it to crazy pita it was much more \"chunky\" and not smooth. It also lacked the real smoky flavor that I love. I thought the chicken souvlaki wrap was very good. The chicken was moist and juicy and had a nice char from the grill. The pita was soft and had the right amount of tomato, onion and tzatziki. The shrimp kabob salad was large and also very good. The one complaint was that the tails were left on the shrimp.   Overall we enjoyed Stephanos, I don't think it was good enough to stop frequenting my other two spots, but if in the area I would definitely go back.",

We both ordered the original beef and lamb gyro combo, but upgraded the regular fries to feta fries. One large combo and one small combo, which we didn't need the small because the large was plenty!! We had the entire small fries left over and there was 3 of us eating. The gyros are a good size, not oversized and stuffed with meat like most places.   Besides maybe being a little pricey, it was great. It is quality food made well.",

Their gyros are good and I just tried the filet mignon bowl tonight, which was awesome. Everything is always fresh and delicious. I love their Greek salad and their rice is bomb. I've done take-out, eat in, and even catering and I've never not been satisfied. The atmosphere in this location is a little more updated than the Maryland location, and has a kind of hipster/industrial feel to it. Employees are always very nice at both locations. The Maryland location has discounts for UNLV students, but has weird hours. I definitely recommend Stephano's!",

I checked in to get the free baklava and he said he'd be right back and get it for me...he never came back. He also didn't give me a cup for my free drink. Ended up having to ask someone for it when I was given my food. The chicken was mediocre nothing special. There was no rice which was desperately needed. The hummus was plenty and the pita were thick. The plate as a whole was just okay, came with a tiny salad. $11.90 chicken plate, no baklava, no rice, and asked for my free drink. If there was a little bit more care in the customer service my experience would've been much better.",

    "text": "I grabbed take-out from Stephanos on my way to visit a friend in Anthem this past Monday night. From the look of the place, everyone (dine-in customers included) orders from the counter, which added to the home-cooked flavor of the place.  Based on the menu, I have a hard time understanding why this restaurant bills itself as a \"Greek\" place because there were so few greek options on the menu! They serve mostly the standard middle eastern fare, which is more than fine by me. The baba ganoush was really good, as were the kofta kebas and chicken shwarma. I was really excited to see kibbi on the menu (can be hard to find in Las Vegas!), but I was pretty disappointed - no meet in the shell, I think it was just bulgar wheat. Maybe it was just some sort of greek kibbi I have never seen before, as it was spelled differently. They offer whole wheat pita, which I thought would be interesting, but we preferred the white.  I live very far away from this location (and not close to the other location either), and it wasn't good enough to warrant a special trip just to eat here. However, I would definitely go back and for those who live nearby, I highly recommend it for weekly middle eastern takeout!",

I have a lot of family who lives there and I make sure that every time I visit them, that I at least come to Stephano's once, if not, every day I'm there! The food is always consistant and I'm in love with their hummus! I can't get enough of this place. I only wish they had one in California. Not only is the food amazing, but the employees are really nice! They always answer every question with a smile on their face, and they really know how to take great care of their customers.  If you're looking for an amazing Mediterranean Grill, Stephano's is definitely the place for you!",

    "text": "Craving gyros and willing to try to search for a closer Greek joint led me to Stephano's.  We got the chicken gyro, a gyro bowl, and an additional large side of hummus. The two cashiers were nice and we got our food fairly quickly. Everything was carefully packed and delicious! My gyro bowl was outstanding, the rice is definitely what makes it! The beef+lamb meat was sooo good, there was definitely a good amount. No skimping here! The hummus was good and the pita was soft and warm. The only downside was that there was no lettuce in the chicken gyro. I had to double-check the online menu to confirm this. It's ok, it was still devoured in True fat fashion. I also got the free baklava when I checked in and the girl was really nice helping me figure out how to check in (yeah, I'm like an old person lol) it was my first time having one and it was yummy!!!   One word about he pricing of the hummus. Unless you really, really don't want a lot of hummus, it's best to put in another $2 to get the large size as the small size is pretty small.  I would come back for the gyro bowl and baklavas!!! . I'll probably give the delivery service a shot as well since we live close by and I'm pretty lazy ^_^",

I have been here a few times and have enjoyed everything so far.  The gyro meat Greek salad is large and filling. A mountain of greens are topped with feta cheese, onions, olives, and no shortage of fresh shaved meat. The choices between salad dressings and pita bread makes it even better. The pomegranate vinaigrette and whole wheat pitas are the special touches to a classic. The gyro pita sandwich is filled to the brim with fresh ingredients when paired with fries and a drink, it is more than enough food. The most recent visit had me sharing a chicken skewers plate and that is enough food for two. A side of cucumber salad, hummus, and rice will have you full in no time.",
