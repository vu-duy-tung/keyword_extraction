This place looked kinda greasy and worn down, which actually made me want to try them out. Got mine \"whiz with\".....it was too cold to sit in the outdoor seating so I ate in the car....I almost made a mess, which is how these sandwiches should be.....it was very tasty, high meat to bread ratio. I'll be back if I'm ever craving a cheesesteak, probably wouldn't make it a destination on its own.",

    "text": "This place is freakin' great! I made mine a chicken philly and my hubby had a classic steak philly with provolone, bell pepper and mushrooms. The classic Philly is a 32 on the menu. The sandwiches were so good. Both the sandwiches were freshly prepared and tasted great because the chicken was thinly sliced.   Next time I'm going to ask for extra cheese though. One slice isn't enough for all the delicious meat. Also the sandwich is amazing with onions, so be sure to request them with your sandwich!  Also I loved the fried okra! I would have never thought of dippin okra in ranch, but it was the perfect accompaniment.  Lastly, and most importantly, the grill master Steve was sooo nice and personable!   The only draw back and thus the 4/5 was the price. 11 dollars for a sandwich is pricey!  This place has great food and service; I NEED one in Los Angeles.",

Although the taste is sketchy sometimes, it's worth going out of your way for... and since it's DEAD CENTER WEST it's not really close to anything.  I think it's be awesome (and cheaper) for them to use nacho cheese instead of cheez wiz. It's probably taste better too since it has a kick.  Big Sloppy sandwiches just like I like them!",

Having passed by it from time to time I always think to myself, why haven't I been there yet. Well, I have seen and I have conquered. All I can say is I can't believe it took me so long.   The atmosphere is pretty cool and they are QUICK with the orders. We waited no longer than five minutes for our entire order to be ready after paying. Even better, they cook it fresh.  This place offer a great dining experience. I had the cheesesteak with mushrooms and whiz, my fella tried the cheesesteak with bacon and swiss. These sandwiches are no joke. Large and in charge. I could barely finish half of a half after also ordering some battered mushrooms and cheez whiz fries. We could definitely have shared one sandwich between the two of us.  I found the sides to be fantastic. I tend to judge a place by it's sides and this place did it for me. They were greasy and delicious, even after a long car ride home.   I'll definitely be back to try some more of their heart attack inducing menu items.",

Our Mestre rented all of us out of towners a place nearby here and when running errands we spotted this place. It reminds me of a 50s carhop. They're menu is pretty big. I settled on the cheesesteak with cheez-whiz, mushrooms and onions and an order of fried okra.  The service was really quick and the sandwich was HUGE, and they were definitely generous with the fried okra. As soon as they placed it in my grubby little hands one half of the sandwich didn't even make it to my table. I'm prided on an Asian mouth and I was reading some reviews about it being too hot. Some may call it hot and mouth burning, I call it fresh.  And after we all ate our sandwiches, we were the first ones back to the house to shower and even after that, people were still waiting for their food at the other food court!",

The bread was really good, the meat was pretty good, but overall it made me remember how much I miss that same sandwich from SteakOut. Since it is closed, Pop's will have to do. Don't get me wrong, it was the most tasty philly I've had in a long while. The cheese fries were real good. The husband is partial to the three cheese chili cheese.",

For starters, the cheez whiz was room temperature...yuck. The beef was bland and not well seasoned.  I ate half of my sandwich and simply could not find the wherewithal to finish it. To date, I have never failed to finish a cheesesteak. I guess there's a first time for everything. To add insult to injury, I had way too many impromptu visits to the porcelain thrown after my visit, I won't be back.  If you insist on eating here, get it to go. The outdoor covered seating was fly ridden. It's hard to eat your steak in one hand and swat fly's with the other.",

    "text": "Not really a Philly steak sandwich fan ,but was intrigued by the building and the  reviews on yelp. We both had the Philly wit cheez whiz an mushrooms and onions. The meat is cooked and sitting in jus,  after u order cook puts meat on flat top w your toppings then put in bread they bring in from Philly . The meat is juicy and tasty, bread is soft and chewy. Liked the cheez whizz , onion and mushroom combination . The sandwich was extremely hot had to wait a couple mins to let it cool. We also ordered fries and fried okra. Fries and okra were made to order , the okra was the frozen stuff served with ranch, it was good not great same as the fries. I think I like capriottis cheese steaks a little better, but would come here because they serve fries :) and have more sides then just chips.   Our two phillys , fries and okra came out to $25, which is not cheap  , I'm glad I read the reviews on yelp , which said it was a little spendy, that's y we stopped by 7 eleven and bought a double big gulp for a couple bucks, saved a little there , I think I'll make it a quick tip . They also have hoagies  .  I will back to try the other menu items. I luv a sandwich shop that serves fries.",

    "text": "I've been coming here for years, but just now getting around to writing a review.  So I'm a West Coast guy, and while I've been to Philly and had a few \"Originals\", I'm hardly an expert on what would be considered a Classic, or Real Philly. I do, however, know what I love, and Pop's is it. I've had Cheesesteaks in so many states, plus a few countries, and each and every time, I can honestly say, \"Wish it was Pop's.\" Seriously, it was this place and Carl's Jr. that I was always fiending for in the sandbox.  Personally, I get the Steak, Provolone, Onions and Mushrooms, plus Sweet and Hot peppers.  The fried green beans are kickass. Their sodas are imports as well as their desserts, Tasty Kake brand. The Black Cherry soda is perfect, but unfortunately expensive because they get it from (I'm assuming) Philly. Tasty Kake Butterscotch is my favorite, although some will probably just compare it to normal packaged bakery stuff, it seems higher quality to me. It's all still packaged sugary baked goods though.  This place is also open 24/7. These poor sods are there to provide losers like myself a Philly on Christmas or Thanksgiving at any time of the night.  If you don't carry cash and want to tip, you have to tell them before they run your card because they can't add anything once you've signed. Has to be done where they add it to your total. Some weird system, I dunno.  The seating is outdoors only, and for some reason the corner there is a vortex of whirlwind. Seriously though... it can be hot as heck outside and you go stand there on the corner at Pop's and the wind is blowing 70 MPH and all of a sudden you're freezing. It's really strange.   The seats are not comfortable, but then, you didn't go to Pop's to sit on the corner of a busy intersection and suck exhaust while eating fried everything with extra cheese Whiz and ranch because of the padding in the chairs. Most likely you're providing the padding yourself.  Parking sucks, I think they offer a grand total of maybe 9 spaces, at an angle, and if you can get out the one way drive through portion of the oddly built building, then you're pretty much stuck heading east on Alta. Turning around when the lot is empty isn't tough, but when it's packed it can be challenging if you're not a great driver. I seriously feel the need to specify the great driver part because we are in Vegas and I drive around town for a living, and Vegas drivers suck in general compared to most other places.",

Kudos Pop's for making every taste bud in my mouth a happy camper. My husband had the #32 and it usually takes a lot to fill him up, the 32 did the trick. He said it's like out of this world good.

I got me a classic steak, Swiss cheese, mushroom, and bell pepper sandwich.  Bread was so soft how I like and beef made my mouth water more. Fresh mushroom and bell pepper all combined well. Also had chili cheese fries. It was a thin chili and fries were cooked the right amount of crispness. They were tasty but messy. Extra napkins are a must. I've never been to Philly but I'll be back to Pop's that's for sure. You never know who you'll run into. One guy was from San Diego and another from Philly. We all were craving a cheese steak.",

The ordering system confused the folks in front of me (despite the big sign that says \"ORDER HERE\" they were at the wrong window and looked upset when I pointed it out to them), but we got our orders in regardless.  The Cheez Whiz steak was awesome, and I also had half a #32. Both were delicious. Service was pretty prompt, and overall I liked the vibe.

Ok, you probably want more info on it, so here you go:  1. These cheesesteaks are big and tasty.  They are stuffed full of meat and toppings on soft, flaky bread. I've tried a couple and have loved them all.  My faves are the 3 cheese steak and the Mushroom and cheese steak.  Delish!  2. Choices on top of choices! Steak or chicken, then 3 types of cheese, add in all sorts of veggies, and you have a lot of variety. You never get tired of the menu.   3. They have Tastykakes!  4. Lots of tasty sides like Cheez Whiz fries, Fried green beans, chips, etc.  Gotta love the sides.  5. The grill man.  I've been lots of times and it always seems the same guy is working. He is super friendly and knows how to cook.  He's just cool and deserves his own line.   Pop's has been on this corner for as long as I remember.  The food is consistently good, the staff is friendly, and you will always leave with a full belly.  What could be better than that?!?!",

The cheesesteak came out with larger pieces of steak and wasn't chopped finely like a True Philly cheesesteak. The meat was not seasoned and was pretty bland. The only good thing was the cheese Fries. I will not be returning to this establishment.",

But the sweet potatoe fries were soggy and mostly just batter (might be the way they wrapped a paper around it, and steam was trapped).  Great for the phillys, not so much on the fries, and a downer for me to not have indoor air conditioned seating (we are in the desert people)",

You have to yell your order at the grill person who is usually distracted by the previous order, nothing is written down so expect to repeat your order five times. They seem to get annoyed if you want your order a specific way (and I'm just talking about basic things like mayo, double cheese, steak cooked well, etc.). I told the guy American cheese five times and ended up with Swiss and provolone. I get the ordering directly to the grill person (common in philly) but either the guys can't hear well through the mesh and noise or they don't understand. I usually go when it's not busy. I've been more than 10 times because the steaks are good for Vegas, but the process is a pain.",

I was hoping to taste the best cheesesteak ever, but unfortunately it didn't happen tonight. The cheesesteak was good sized and it was filled up it just lacked flavor. The meat was bland and the hoagie was salty and stale. I'm not sure if it was fresh being as it took less than 5 mins for the guy to call my name. Anywho I'm saddened it wasn't an amazing cheese steak as I was really craving one, but hey at least I tried this place once.",

My husband can eat a whole sandwich and be satisfied I personally can only eat half then save the other half for later it is well worth the money. This last visit was nice because there was no line! Sometimes there is a line but it moves real quick.   I recommend it to anybody that loves cheese steaks and all who think they don't. It is on a old school original A-frame wiener schnitzel and if it is your first time you can drive through the middle of the \"A\" but don't think there is a drive-thru to order food it is simply a place to get you back on the road you must park in the lot and walk up to the window.  The \"Mozzarella Sticks\" and \"Cheese Whiz Fries\" are super yummy.  You can sign up for their e-club and get coupons and deals.  I have seen that they now have a food truck as well at a couple food truck events so give it a try!",

I don't understand the allure of cheese whiz.   I also don't eat beef, which may compromise the legitimacy of my review for some people, but I'm pleased with requesting a sandwich with chicken, onions, mushrooms, provolone, and hot peppers. The bread that night was different. Not as smooth, but instead had a slight grainy feel on the outside. It was still warm and soft, but I prefer their typical loaf, which doesn't leave as much of a crumby mess.  Everything is made to order and hot. It's a good guilty meal. My only gripe is that I never want to eat there because the tables are dirty.",

The cook was really friendly and I enjoyed watching him cook it was a great 1st time experience if your ever in the area you should definitely stop by and check them out.   Ps. Make sure you have a lil money on you though these ain't Mccy dz prices!",

If your wondering if it's authentic as a philly steak I would say it's close. A simple change would be that the cheese to under the meat not on top. I know it's semantics but that's how they do it in philly which by the way is where I'm from.",

I had a program at the Nevada State Museum and after doing a quick check of my bookmarks, this is where I stopped.  Ordering is through a screen on the left side, pay on the right side window, and pick up there also.  I ordered the #32, a cheesesteak with peppers and mushrooms.  The cook asks if you want onions and I got them, too.  I also ordered some fries and a diet Coke.  All seating is on the patio.  Keep that in mind when it's in the cold months or in the middle of summer when it's 100 degrees at 9 PM.  My sandwich was tasty and it was OK.  I should have ordered extra cheese because that was the only thing I found lacking.  When I make cheesesteaks at home, I always load up on the cheese.  The roll was great.  Very fresh.  The fries were pretty standard.  I did notice that they have other foods they deep fry including Oreo pieces for deep frying.  I might need to stop here for a dessert some evening before it gets to be the hot days of summer.  The parking lot is small.  The staff was very pleasant.",

Cashier was friendly and so were the cooks. The cooks also take your order to help speed it up which helps.  So since I'm from the East coast all Phillys come with CHEESE WIZ. I was beyond excited to finally try a place in vegas with Cheese Whiz. I ordered fries and a philly with onions and peppers and I specifically said CHEESE WHIZ, because I was so excited.  Going off the trust system I didn't watch them make it and told them to go even though I was eating it there. I get to my table and my sandwich has PROVOLONE :( :( :( :( I asked for cheese whiz. My partner saw I was upset and asked me if I wanted him to go get it fixed. Since I work in restaurants I never complain and just take it. Plus the line was long again and knew it would take forever honestly and I waited long enough for this one in the first place. I was excited for my partner to try it too.  I only want to go back because I want to actually have what I ordered. Next time write down the orders. This could have been avoided if you had tickets to go off of and not memory. Remember that. I gave this place a three star because the staff was friendly and they handled their own. It wasn't super fast, they just kept up.",

It's not healthy food, but it's delicious fried and grilled food loaded with cheese. I haven't had a \"True Philly cheesesteak,\" but I would say they make a good one. I had the chicken Philly cheesesteak with cheese whiz, and it was hot, gooey, and tasty. The bread was soft and fresh. I also tried their cheese whiz fries, which I would also recommend. They had tons of other fried choices to go with your sandwich. If you aren't looking for a Philly cheesesteak, or something fried, then this place can offer nothing to you.  The cooking area looked clean and sanitary, and the dining area was clean and picked up, with just a couple trash cans overflowing.   Service was quick and to the point, and I got my food pretty quickly. I was there at 10:30 pm on a Wednesday, and it was moderately busy.   It's all outdoor seating with slightly uncomfortable stools that are at a fixed height and length from the table as they are bolted into the ground. Each table has no more than four seats. They have a nice mural, and on a day with nice weather, it's delightful       Part of the lower score comes because the surrounding area isn't quite the safest. While in line, I heard three gunshots, and soon after the place was buzzing with over 10 police cars. They were driving around leading me to believe there was still a suspect at large. There was also a man asking people in line for money and getting pretty close. The employees firmly asked him to leave, and said he is a common problem. There is also a sign entering the dining area warning customers that the employees will defend themselves with guns. There were also some shady \"transactions\" happening in the parking lot area.",

However, I decided to make the trip.  I am so glad that I did.  The place is a walk up stand with out door seating.  I have only been in the winter time, and I am a wimp when it comes to cold weather, so I have only gotten it to go.    The service is fast.  The ordering system is efficient.  The cashier is fast and efficient.  The menu is limited, but what they do, they do well!  I have now been several times.  The sandwiches have been consistently great.  They are flavorful, slightly greasy (in a good way) and definitely sloppy (which is the fun way to eat).  I have had both the chicken and the beef cheese steaks and both have been absolutely delicious.  The bread is soft and absorbs the juice and grease.    There are two things I do not do at restaurants - wait more than 15 minutes for a table or make a special trip for a fast food restaurant.  However, for the food from this place, I will definitely make the trip, no matter how inconveniently located.  You should note that if you are going to use a credit card, they pass along a credit card fee to you.  Also, don't stick to just the sammiches.  The fried mushroom appetizers are delicious.  But if you don't let them cool for a few minutes, you are totally going to burn the roof of your mouth.",

The meat quality is so substandard ... Its chewy, salty, and would never fly in Philadelphia.  Dont waste your money here, try anywhere else.  The meat and saltiness of their philly with onions and wiz was foul!  Sandwich tossed after two bites (the first bite was wtf?... The second bite was 'i cant eat this shit)...  I warned you",

    "text": "Meh... it certainly it not BOO's Philly Cheesesteaks in Los Angeles, but I guess if you want something this does fine... I'm picky about flavor and their cheesesteaks lacked flavor, it was it's just too salty. Star snatched. Salt doesn't equate flavor. The meat tasted like \"steakums\" not fresh to me. Fresh meat has a texture to it that is tender and you don't have the chomp down on a cheesesteak... it should practically melt in your mouth, regardless of the toppings selected. Star snatched. I ordered the mushroom steak and asked for bell peppers as well... get home they aren't even in the sandwich- and no they weren't busy enough to excuse it. Star snatched. On top of all of that...The provolone cheese wasn't even melted... everything was \"extra\" and I've never been anywhere that charges \"Per topping\" it's usually whatever steak-combination you choose and you can say if you do or do not want grilled onions and/or bell peppers... not that it is an extra charge unless you actually want EXTRA. no grilled onions just a sad excuse for a Philly cheesesteak IMHO, but alas this is Vegas. My search for a cheesesteak home out here continues. The primary plus is it's open 24/7... but the only people who care about that is those who believe this to be good. Won't be back.   3/3/2017 Soooo the owner wants to reply about using fresh ingredients but what I got was clearly not fresh- nor was it good. No comment on my missing items though... interesting. Give you all another try? Not unless it's free seeings that I didn't get what I actually did pay for on my first visit- but even then, I'll pass. Sorry- the food just wasn't good.",

My sweet friend Sergio I noticed often has a very large appetite on the nights we hang out. Pop's is close to his house so it makes a stop very convenient late at night since they are always open.  The staff is friendly and they make good solid food so this review will be sweet and simple. I have had a variety of their cheesesteaks in the past and they have always been good with quality ingredients. I must say that I really enjoy their sweet potato fries that come with a yummy coconut dipping sauce. Their regular French fries are great as well and are fresh cut.  Service is great, food is great and they are open 24/7. My only tip to you is that this is not a place to come to if you are low on cash, you better save those coins for the dollar menu somewhere else if you are on a budget! lol  Take out is your best option as it is a free standing store with a few patio chairs and tables to sit at outside. It is on a busy street so it may not be as comfortable relaxing to eat with cars whizzing by plus the crazy wind.  Check Pop's Philly Steaks out!",

Not impressed.. nothing was fresh I don't care what they say..i suppose bc of the fast nature of the business maybe they precook the veggies. We ordered chicken Philly with provolone and Philly cheese steak with provolone..cheeze wiz is the most horribly processed ingredient and we couldn't bare the taste so we passed on this Philly tradition. We ordered okra as well which was frozen but I expected that.. the ranch dressing dipping sauce was from a powder that I didn't like.. the chicken and steak was that quick frozen thin sheet type of meat.. this was just not my type of place.. now I'm craving a east coast cheese steak.  ..$12 for each sandwich..a, waste of money",

    "text": "I've always been a fan of Pop's Philly sandwiches, even though they are a little expensive. And while the now-defunct Triple Play was better (and cheaper), this is the place to go if you're craving a cheesesteak.  We ordered one provolone and one Cheez Whiz, both with onions. At $10 a pop (plus an extra $5 for fries and tip), this was a pricey lunch! But we don't eat there often (and no one should probably be making a cheesesteak part of their daily diet), so the splurge was worth it. Plenty of meat, nice chewy bread, and a healthy (or not) helping of cheese on each. The fries were kind of mushy, but they served their purpose. Next time we'll try the fried okra. (They also have fried mushrooms, sweet potato fries, and a few other sides that didn't appeal to me.)  If you take a trip to the A-frame building, know your protocol before stepping up to the window: Order on the left, watch the guy make your food, then pay on the right. There's a small outdoor dining area if you want to breathe in the smells of fried onions and exhaust fumes from passing cars. Otherwise, do what we do: Take your cheesesteaks home, where you can enjoy them with a nice cold beverage of your choosing.",

When it comes to sandwiches though, the bread is as essential as what is inside of it, and just like many other similar sandwich places, the bread is very average, if does not scream fresh, especially for a place that serves nothing but sandwiches. I am not saying it is not fresh, just that it is very plain with the same doughy substance as the bread you buy from your supermarket that has been sitting there for a couple of days with an expiration date on the bag. When a place serves sandwiches, it is imperative that the bread is amazing, after all it is the first thing that will enter your mouth and determines the substance of every bite and chew. They meats are good, but nothing that screams amazing; I think people are attracted to it because of the locale and the length of time it has been there, and it would be nice to compliment it with the best of everything; after all for what you pay, investing a few more pennies on good bread is a small price to pay in cost to give the customer a True value for what you would expect from such an old fixture in Vegas... I have not tried anything else on the menu, but with a place called \"Philly Steaks\", that is the only item on the menu you need to try....",

The only thing that puts this as a 4 instread of a 5 is the location. Though I have never had any issues here, I also don't feel it is the safest part of town.

    "text": "I've dined there a couple times over the past year that I've lived in the Las Vegas area.   As a vegetarian, I basically get a massive, molten glob of several cheeses, grilled onions, lettuce & then add some ketchup or BBQ sauce (*if* I can find it there).     The reaction I get from other customers is always interesting as I tell the cook I'm a vegetarian, HOWEVER it turns out that one of the cooks that's there often is actually a vegetarian too, and note to some of you tough-guys: just because some of us vegetarians care enough about other animals to not eat them, it does not imply we don't mind fighting & hurting some dumb human who decides he needs to offer his opinion on vegetarians if he overhears our order.    The bread is very fresh, and of course it & the rest of the gooey, heart-attack-calling mess tastes great.    I used to get a side of fries, but they weren't anything special, and even 200+lb glutton me doesn't need to fries if I'm planning on eating the whole sandwich then & there.    I can & will continue to try other cheesesteak joints.   I know this will disgust some of you carnivores, but some cheese-steak places actually have a fake meat item (called seitan) that they'll use to create a vegetarian cheesesteak that looks and YES, once you add the cheeses, onions, sauces, etc. TASTES very similar to a real cheesesteak, so I am still looking for places that do that (Pop's doesn't).     However, the product I eat at Pop's is great, and another wonderful thing about it is that it's open 24/7.   It's shaded but otherwise outdoor seating, right along the race-track/circus show that is Decatur Blvd near Arizona Charlie's -- NOT a place to be for the faint of heart, so either get it to go & get the hell out of that area, or strap-up your gat & go sit there at 2AM & enjoy your food & the 'entertainment' the street & Pop's provide.",

I only eat seafood so wanted the fish philly but they were out. We arrived just short of midnight. Decided on the tuna but there was only enough for one of us so me and the wife had to share. Ok so with all these hiccups why the 5 stars? I explained that I wanted my tuna sub like the philly sandwiches. They had never done it before and was very confused. Then out of nowhere I got the \"what the heck\" and he went for it. He made it just for me and I couldn't have been happier. It came out amazing!!!! Get there earlier if you want the less popular foods (seafood).",

No indoor dining area and no drive through, but yet somehow this place it getting a four star rating from GA.   I ordered the #3, Steak and American cheese. 'Merica! Topped with grilled onions for good measure. It got better with every bite. Juicier and juicier with melted cheese all the way to the end. The French fries were hot and crispy. Next time I'll try the Cheese Whiz fries like JR got. They looked they could have been named after some crazy 80's band. They looked \"Totally Cheezy Awesome.\" They have a sign that says they welcome you watching your food being prepared. So I did. It was kind of cool. They serve breakfast sandwiches too. Can't wait to try one.",

    "text": "My hubby is obsessed with Philly's and this 24/7 joint has been in operation like what seems like forever. There are so many places to eat in Vegas that we didn't find this place until we lived in Vegas for 7 years. Really.  Alright you'll want to go here when the weather is cooler and not during the main eating hours as you have to stand in a very long, long, long line and then wait for a place to sit and open up and that's not easy when you're carrying a brown bag full of sandwiches and cheesy whiz fries and drinks. The menu is simple and you can top your Philly with anything you like and watch the staff cook it right in front of you through their walk up windows.  Didn't add anything complicated with the sandwich except have onions, peppers and cheese on it and that was enough. The steak was lean, nicely cooked and all the toppings fresh and the cheese melted just right. It's a mouthful of a sandwich but def worth the wait and standing in line.  Little tip, at night this area can be considered a little sketchy, remember you are eating outside near a very busy main thoroughfare in a corner location and that there are on occasion homeless people wandering and begging for food. But don't let that deter you from having a great sandwich here as it's a great local hole in the wall and the quality is consistent.",

I settled on the number 32.. cheesesteak with peppers, onions, mushrooms, white American, and cheese whiz! Also, Cheese whiz fries with the whiz on the side! Whizzup with that you ask? There would be quite the drive home, and I just couldn't imagine improperly reheating the whiz!   Anyway, the steak was so delicious the seasoning was really perfect! The bread did the sandwich justice holding up till the last bite, soaking up every bit of tastiness! The veggies, perfectly cooked with a touch of bite, nothing too overpowering for the next item!   The whiz fries... very simple but I could add them into my weekly routine of \"don't stare at me I'm eating for two\" pregnant binge eating stops!   Also, tip the cook! He's very friendly!!",

    "text": "First time out to Pop's today. I wish it wasn't so windy. There is no inside dining area. Just tables and stools under a roof right off of noisy Decatur Blvd. Not the best ambience but cool atmosphere. All kinds of retro feels with the A-frame and the 50s style diner stools. Little old roadside stops like this are a piece of Americana. I was reminded of the legendary Pink's Hot Dogs in LA. Pop's may not have quite that legendary status but that doesn't mean the food isn't great. It most certainly is.  I ordered a #32 which has fresh mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, beef and choice of cheese. I chose cheese whiz. That is the way to go. I also ordered fried mushrooms because of my well documented love of the fungi and a Dr. Brown's root beer.  I was struck by the smells emminating from behind the cage today. I was already hungry when I ordered. Had I not been hungry the smell of the steak cooking would have gotten me there. I could hardly wait for my sandwich. Then I saw another persons order being wrapped. I was drooling by this point. I needed my food!  My sandwich was ready first. The order of mushrooms did not seem to be communicated from the cook to the cashier. They were ready in just a couple of minutes. No harm. No foul. Both sandwich and shrooms were piping hot which was nice considering I had to eat outside on a cool windy day. That will warm you throug and through.   But its those first bites which warm your soul. The salty beef, sweet peppers and onions, earthy mushrooms and funky orange cheese whiz harmonize so beautifully. The roll is just sturdy enough to contain all the excitement without being over bearing. The ratio of filling to bread is spot on.   The same is True for the fried mushrooms. Whole meaty shrooms and a few stems lightly breaded and fried golden brown. Not too bready. Just enough to keep it crisp. Served with a cup of ranch dressing. To me, a little ranch goes a long way. It wasn't a necessary condiment but welcomed to the party in my mouth.  The food was awesome today at Pop's. Service was friendly but seemed disjointed. From my order of fried mushrooms not being readily recognized to the delays in being rung up as the cashier was also working the fryer. It took a while all around from standing in what seemed like a short line, to paying and to receiving my order. And for the life of me I could not find napkins anywhere. At a place that serves one of the messiest sandwiches known to man you would think there would be napkins at the tables, at the order counter, in the bag. But no. No such luck. I resorted to licking my fingers. Sssshhhh, don't tell my mom. I still have cheese beneath my nails. Crazy. But I'll be back. Mark my words.",

    "text": "POP'S is bringing me out of retirement!   So I was a YELPing machine a few years back. Then I wasn't. Now I want to be again. What better recipe for my return then a sloppy, cheesy, fresh made, amazing smelling, awesome tasting, authentic Philly Cheese Steak from POP'S? Honestly, there is no better recipe.  I'm no philly cheese steak aficionado, but the minute that sammich hit my mouth it was love at first taste. The peppers and onions were cooked amazing (I asked for them to be well done), the extra cheese wiz requested actually wasn't even necessary, and the steak meat was tender, juicy, and went perfect with all of the complimenting ingredients. This was one of the better sandwiches I've had in my life. This isn't diet food, then again, if you go to a place named POP'S looking for something healthy, you're probably the same person that goes to McDonalds and orders a super size fry and a DIET coke.   POP's is a treat and I'll definitely be back. Hit the jackpot when someones order got messed up and was given complimentary chili cheese fries. I mean chili cheese fries are a gift in itself, but FREE chili cheese fries? Wowee.   My POP's (aka Dad) told me he ate at this place in 1979 and called it the \"finest cheese steak in Las Vegas and probably Nevada.\" When Pop's gives POP'S props, it's legit.",

    "text": "Ok, so im from philly. So this review is for you transplants who may want to consider eating here.   If you grew up in or around philly (im from lower bucks), you know how a cheesesteaks supposed to be made.  The guys are supposed to take your order,  grill up the meat, grill the onions& peppers alongside the meat, add the cheese and hash it all together with a spatula. Then its supposed to be served on a foot long (aka 18\") hoagie roll.   Pops did it a bit differently. The meat & veggies were precooked and sitting to the side of the grill. The cook took a scoop of each and put them on the grill, stirred them up a bit, and added my cheese. Then he took a roll, opened it and put it on top, scooping it up so that the cheese was only on the bottom of the roll.   The taste was still pretty authentic, but i wish id gotten mine fresh.   The \"restaurant\" itself was similar in feel to an old-time drive in restaurant, except it did have a covered patio with 6 or 7 tables. Very dive-y. I liked it.   In conclusion, this was a perfect spot for a post-drive in movie date (10 minutes away on rancho), fun, and a decent cheesesteak, at least for vegas.   Ill be back for sure. A solid 4 stars.",

Two times we ordered the chicken Philly with peppers mushrooms, onions, AND CHEESE WHIZ and BOTH times provolone was put on the chicken Philly but not the steak Philly. The first time I figured it was a mistake but the second time was just extremely disappointing. I do not live close to there so when I finally make time to go over there for a Philly and the order is wrong it's just disappointing. In my eyes a Philly isn't a Philly without cheese whiz... and we do not look at it until we are home across town. So I just wanted to write this to bring awareness to the cooks. The food is amazing and I will never ever say it's not. It's just when you're in the mood for something and get exactly what you didn't order it kinda sucks.. we love Pops though and will forever be customers. I just hope this changes some things.",

They are fast, there's plenty of meat, the cheese is nice and gooey, and They have good sides. I've ordered their wings and they were decent. But I almost always go for a #32 Philly cheesesteak with everything. The sandwiches so big I usually eat half the next day.  I keep coming back to Pop's because even though it is not a superior Philly Cheesesteak, it is tender, the veggies are great, they are fast and there is plenty of meat.",

I recommend the philly cheese steak. You can have it with provolone or Cheesewhiz. Take sandwich is quite large so you can save half of it, especially if you order side items. They have different fried side items like onion rings, fries, fried mushrooms, fried green beans and okra.  It's not too far from old town Vegas off of Decatur. Highly recommend this place to you carnivores!",

The breakfast grinder is another great option. As for sides, fried mushrooms, zucchini sticks, fries, and jalapeno poppers are all great choices.

There is no indoor seating but during the nicer times of year it is really nice to sit outside on the patio. I found this place on accident just after moving to Vegas 4 1/2 years ago and i've been hooked ever since. Love love love Pop's!!",

The bread is amazing, and makes sense that they bring it in from back East.

It was very delicious and the topping were piled high almost falling out of the hoagie roll. Open 24/7 it works with my work schedule very well. A little pricey compared to some places but it makes up for it in a packed sandwich.",

CANNED mushrooms..YUCK!) And now here I am 2 DAYS LATER still throwing up. Tried to email them, yet their email is INACTIVE! SUPER EXPENSIVE!

I'd rather drive 7 hours back to Franks in San Marcos, CA for real cheese steaks. Pop's steaks were salty tasting with stale Amoroso's bread. And the service sucked. I exspecting rudeness when you ar in Philly, because that's how we can be. But I do not exspect it from a culture who is not from or even been to the East Coast. Do not go to Pop's cheese steak Resturant. It's a waste of time and money.",

Sides are expensive too at $4 for an In-N-Out sized paper tray! =/  The did have variety on sides you can get cheez wheels, deep fried zucchini and deep fried okra. The side of sweet potato fries I ate wasn't bad at all, had good crunch (the number one thing I look for in a fry) and natural sweet potato flavor. The flavor was enhanced even further with this syrup dipping sauce that had a hint of cinnamon. =)   I don't get how people can eat Cheez Whiz it's so processed it can't even be called cheese! I just didn't grow up with it, but apparently it's THE topping to get for Philly Cheesesteaks. You can even get a side of fries slathered with it here.   This location was most likely converted from a Wienerschnitzel since it had the signature triangle roofline and drive-thru. The covered seating provided sheltered for our group when we experienced a spontaneous downpour during lunch. I enjoyed the mural of Benjamin Franklin affably holding a Philly Cheesesteak, just drives the point home that what is in his hand is indeed a Philly Cheesesteak and if you don't order one here you are un-patriotic! =p",

I was there one day when the UPS guy showed up with the boxes of rolls from Amaroso's Bakery in Philadelphia.  My complaints are no indoor seating, which is a problem during the miserable Las Vegas Summers.  From May to September, you basically have to get it to go.  And it's not as good unless it's hot and fresh.  The person taking the order doesn't always get it right. Double check your orders before you leave.  And it is very pricey.  You'll pay over $15 for a sandwich, fries, and a drink.  But I guess you pay extra for the Philly imported ingredients.  The taste is good though and it is the best cheesesteak I've had outside of Philly.  I do like the fact that they are 24/7/365!",

They are also serving up grinders, have a bunch of sides (fried mushrooms, cheese sticks, pinwheels, etc.). They also serve TastyKakes (and you get a free one on your birthday)! Best part of all this awesomeness is that is available to you, Las Vegas, 24/7!  I've  been to Pop's several times. I've always ordered their cheesesteaks and you gotta get the Cheez Whiz. I NEVER eat cheez wiz ever (cheese from a can?! What?!) and it a MUST and Philly tradition to do so. I always order mine with peppers, onions, and mushrooms. I've seen people say that everything was pre-cooked. The veggies were, but the meat was laid on the grill fresh, we had to wait for our fries, too. So, that may have been the past, but it's not True now. This was also at 10 PM on a Sunday night. The roll was soft, the meat was juicy and tender, and the whiz, the whiz was the whiz. A great sandwich. It came out to $10.99 before tax, but I can only eat half a time.   If you have a late night craving or are needing something to soak up all the alcohol from your late night Vegas shenanigans, pop on over to Pop's!  They only offer outdoor seating and no public restrooms.",

The meat was flavorful. The shrooms, onions, and peppers reminded me of pizza.  IT WAS DELISHHHHHHHHHHH.  It was open late which is a big plus.   Considering that it's open late, it's kinda scary!!!  We were the only ones there; and the workers work behind a bullet-proof window (OK, I WAS KIDDING BOUT THE BULLET-PROOF WINDOW!!!!!)  Alas, the food is worth getting shot at for..... WELL, I, MAYBE, NOT SHOT AT... maybe, a stab wound.........lol j/k  My review: MUST SAMPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "I really hate to leave a bad review for this place. I've been going her for as long as I can remember. Since it changed from Philly Steakout to Pop's. I absolutely love their sandwiches and never really had bad service or a complaint for that matter.  I was craving a Philly Cheese Steak last night, but couldn't get one until my check hit. So I really really really wanted a Philly Cheese Steak tonight.   It was a bit chilly out and there was a couple on the side, I was told they already ordered. So I placed my order a #32 and a #6 both with bacon. The previous two times prior they were pretty sparse with the meat and bacon compared to what I'm used to, I figured it was just the Grill Master. This time was no different, he put a lot of onions for one sandwich and barely any for the other, I didn't say anything because I don't like to complain. He made my sandwiches, then cut them wrapped them and put them aside. I figured he was waiting for the cashier to come ring me up, so I patiently waited. He began assisting the couple that had already ordered. (It appeared they were waiting for wings) I figured it would be just a minute or two and I would get my food, however that was not the case. I ended up waiting for over 7 minutes, the couples card declined 3 times. I decided I wasn't going to pay $25+ for two cold sandwiches that have been sitting there for about 10 minutes.   Money is tight so I haven't been able to indulge as much as I would like and I was really looking forward to a Hot Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. I think the employees really dropped the ball this time. If I'm paying around $12 a sandwich I want it hot. If you're helping someone else, that's fine I'll wait. I want my food hot off the grill.  I want the old Grill Master back. The Philly was stuffed to the rim and there was bacon in every bite. I never once got cold food.",

The sandwiches were a little expensive, at least in my opinion, but they were full of meat and toppings, so I can't complain too much. As for flavor, well, to be honest, I've had much better. These weren't  bad, just not that great. Plus, they have no restroom, which is really weird for a food place. It's also not the cleanest place around, but I suppose that's part of it's seedy tasty charm. :P  We'll probably be back at some point, simply because it's open so late, unless we find something better.",

    "text": "Yummy food with a really good value. I have now been here twice in less then a month. First time was by stumbling onto it on accidents while trying to find another Philly cheese place I had a coupon for. They have a walk up window where you watch the grill master make your sandwiches.  Both times I got the mushroom, pepper and onion philly.Juicey, cheesy and big! Room mate got the pastrami both times as well. Another big juicy sandwich. I normally don't like pastrami minus a place in Cali name The Hat! Stole a bite to try it and may actually get it next time. We have had the fried green beans , yummy with a thick ranch sauce. The sweet potato fries with some sort of coconut dipping sauce. They should be considered a sin. So sweet and yummy. Whole reason I went back a second time was to have my friend try them with a to go order.  Also had the banana fosters bites. First one was yummy second one was ok, third one I only had the half of before I stopped eating it. Tasted like warm banana pudding with a soggy graham cracker crust and deep fried with a thin batter. Think they were store bought  rather then made on location. A good thing to try in a group but I won't be ordering them again for just me.    Prices are good for the amount of food you get. Main and pretty much only draw back I can think of is no indoor seating. Definitely going back more in the summer . Right on the street and fun to watch passing traffic but in the winter its a bit to cold. We wolfed down our food as quickly as we could the first time, and wised up the second time with a to go order. If you like Philly Cheese this is a great place to go  and well worth the drive even if it is across town!",

There's been a lot of hype recently over Pop's Philly Steaks--especially now that they have a food truck running (I see them parked in front of LVAC and downtown for Vegas StrEats.)   A few of my friends went down to their free-standing restaurant to eat and said the food was awesome! They're 24-hrs which totally works with my hectic schedule. So I made it a point to stop by.   I went around 10 or 11pm. No crowd, little wait, quick service. The food is cooked right there in front of us and they prepare everything \"to-go.\" I ordered a Philly with onions and provolone and a heaping portion of fried okra luxuriously served in a large paper bag. My meal cost approx $15 w/o a drink.  I think Pop's is simply a hot sandwich. Not particularly flavorful or delicious. It's alright food, I would just rather spend my $15 elsewhere. I might give them another shot in the future. I've heard this place is hott on the cheese whiz. But overall it was a mediocre meal. Not bad food, just maybe not my kinda food.   The seating is entirely outdoors (not so great for the hot summer days or cold winter nights)--make sure you dress appropriately.",

The cheese wiz was actually one hell of a good idea, tasted really good with the sandwich and different from what I expected if I would have just chosen the common cheeses such as provolone.  The only difference from what my friend told me that would have made this equal to Pat's or Ginos was the bun used.  The bun in Pops was not that great in my opinion as well.  I have never tasted Ginos nor Pats so I can only go by from what he says.  I do recommend this place however. Still the best Philly u can get in Vegas from what others I have tried so far.

I was surprised to discover it was an outdoor establishment with no indoor seating, and wasn't sure what to expect since the place doesn't look like much at first glance.   But looks can be deceiving, and I was VERY impressed with the food -- everything is made to order, so even though we sat outside in the 60 degree evening to eat our phillies at one of the tables, the food was piping hot.  I liked that they had a few options for cheese since I'm not a cheese whiz fan, so I got provolone instead with peppers and onions and it was delish.  My boyfriend got the same and we shared the crunchy fried green beans with marinara sauce, which were very good.  Portions were pretty big so you definitely get a lot of food for your money.  I'd definitely go here again!",

    "text": "So I heard about this place from some family and was craving something savory in bread so I wanted to try it out. The place Is tight on parking but I came at a not so busy time 3pm and there was parking and no line. It is outdoors, it was a little windy and the eating area is small. I looked at the menu and went for the #32 and fried mushrooms to go with it with ranch. It came with steak onions provolone cheese bell peppers and mushrooms. I have this review a 4/5 flavor wise because it tasted a little flavor less to me and I took this to go so I was at home and added some salt and pepper which made it a million times better. The steak was juicy and the veggies were grilled perfectly. Just needs more flavor like I said. The bread was soft tho and perfect. The fried mushrooms were okay, I rather try the chili cheese fries next time. But overall like I said I give it 4/5 stars. The chili cheese steak looked interesting too, but I'll maybe think of coming back",

But then again, I'm from an island in the middle of the pacific and now live in the desert so my experience with Philly Steaks is limited.

I am super disappointed. The green beans and Cauliflower were over cooked in old oil. This has never happen in the 7 years I been coming here.

We both thought is was OK, but no match for the steaks at the Triple Play and certainly not close to Genos, etc in Philly. Yesterday was no exception, but perhaps a little worse. I don't know what kind of meat they used but I can't believe it was rib steak. It tasted either old or previously frozen. It was WAY,WAY overcooked also. Maybe it was only fair because they were so busy, but I'm not going to go back to see. The bread,wiz,onion, and peppers would have been a better combo.",

I can see why they call this place pops philly steaks, because now whenever I'm hungry I think pops lol",

Cheesy side murals, dim lighting, hand painted signs, all the makings for a secret delicious spot.  I ordered the chicken Philly with bell peppers, provolone, and mushroom. It was very hot and cheesy, which was a plus! But almost too hot....I had to pause in between bites or else risk third degree burns. Overall it was kind of tasteless. And dry. The fries were no good, we ate a couple and tossed the rest. That's pretty bad considering I love fries so much that my standards are pretty low. They tasted like fries you would get at the public pool snack stand when you were a kid.  Overall I would say this is fine if you're hungry and in the area....but definitely would not make a special trip for it. Most likely I will not be back again.",

I was looking for a post-workout meal ( some Phillies can be quite nutritious depending on what you pile on) and this place came up on yelp.   The first thing I noticed was the large helping of steak Pop's puts on their sandwich (hello protein), I had to look more. Then I saw they serve sweet potato fries... Then I was sold.   The philly I ordered was a #32 which was a 9\" philly served with about 5 oz. o strip steak, onions, bell peppers, red peppers, your choice of cheese, and mushrooms (I didn't get the mushrooms)  I also got an order of sweet potato fries with their cinnamon for sauce ( I didn't care for the sauce)  Well I calculated the nutritional information for my meal and it was as follows: Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich  Cal 414   Protein 30g   Carbs 36g    Fat 15g  Sweet Potato Fries (3 oz.) full portion is about (5 oz.)

There are many more places to get a great cheese steak in the valley, and unless I'm in the area, I don't see a need to come back here.  I got the Bacon and Swiss Cheese steak.  Everything should be better with bacon, right?  Not in this case, the bacon didn't add much flavor, and the swiss was definitely a mistake.  A good cheese steak always comes with whiz.  Provolone is acceptable but if you really want the flavor, the whiz is where it's at.  The steak itself was sliced perfectly and was melt in your mouth, except it lacked a flavor.  The sandwiches were nice sized for what you pay, but overall for someone who is just a Philly Steak place, it was a bit of a letdown.    They have a lot of sides, and I can't comment on their flavors.  If you find yourself in the northern part of the west side, this place will more than meet your need for cheese steak at all hours of the night.  They do have a nice seating area, and they have misters for the heat.",

I prefer my philly steak sandwiches to have a garlic mayo, noticeable slices of onion and bell peppers and mushroom. I got a #4 which is the steak with provolone cheese.  size was good and steak portion was great, so was the steak flavor.  I didn't see too many noticeable onions though since it was pre-sauteed and mixed in.  just the sandwich was $10.80 after tax.  meh, I'd say it was worth it.  I am not a fan of cheez whiz, which there seemed to be a lot of varieties of items using it, but at least it is Kraft brand. Oh well, take it as you will.  I would recommend this place though.",

Maybe we just went on a bad day I don't know, I would try it one more time but as of right now I was not impressed. They do not offer any sort of kid friendly menu such as hotdogs or something like that that was a downside for us as well.  UPDATE:  after reading a message from someone at this establishment who was unhappy with my review, I likely WON'T give it a second try. Seriously, for you to say your demographic isn't children which is why you don't serve any kid friendly food is ridiculous! You are not a bar or a club, if you were I'd totally understand and would not have even mentioned lack of kids menu. This is a freakin sub shop... and FYI there are tons of families in the area and having a few simple items on the menu MIGHT boost your business!  Funny I saw high chairs at your restaurant ... WHY? you don't serve kid friendly food! Oh well.  Lesson learned.",

I was looking forward to trying Pops, as many people have said they're the most authentic in the city.  Well, they tried too, but unfortunately, it wasn't the experience I'm used to from Philly. The meat wasn't browned enough. The roll was somehow too soft, which is weird because they use the same Amoroso rolls that are used in Philly. And then the whiz.... they poured it on top of the meat. Travesty, I tell you. In Philly, they mix it in with the meat so that you have an equal bite of cheese to meat. I honestly didn't think it'd make much of a difference, but i had a ton of cheese in the bites I took from the top of the sandwich, and no cheese on the bottom of the sandwich.   They did have tastykakes though. That made me pretty happy. I also like how they're open 24 hours a day. I'll have to try one of their breakfast hoagies (incorrectly named by Pops as \"Breakfast Phillys\".... honestly, if you go into a sandwich shop in philly and ask for anything called  \"philly\", they will not know what you're talking about).  So why the three star review if I was dissatisfied? Well, I hate giving low reviews to perfectly good businesses. I'm sure what I ate was a great sandwich. For people from Vegas who want a good cheesesteak, this is a great option. For people from Philly who've had the real deal however, you may be a little disappointed that it doesn't taste like it's from back home.",

Anyhow, POP's is even more fanatical about cheesesteak. Look at their website and the detailed manifesto explaining why they use Liberty Steaks, Amarosa Bakery rolls and other carefully sourced and authentic ingredients.  It shows in the finished product, a Pat's style sandwich with ribeye chopped on the grill. I order mine wit extra onions (caramelized to a beautiful brown) and Cheez Whiz. I recommend you do the same. Can't go wrong with the classics.  This is a True Philly style experience with a walk up counter, metal tables on a patio, and a mural of Ben Franklin on the wall, and it's open 24/7. It's a half hour drive for me but well worth it. Best cheesesteak in Vegas, easily.",

I was fine with the waiting until the man at the register automatically started ringing up the woman behind me without even acknowledging me or asking for my order. Another five or so minutes passed then the woman next to me apologized for them taking her before me and even asked if I could just get an Italian Ice to which the guy at the grill gave an annoyed look and said the other guy would get it. I waited another 5 minutes of nothing with no line besides the woman who was orginally behind me before deciding to just leave. The man ran out the back door to say he'd take my order when we were already across the street getting into the car. Never have had their food but for that alone i will NEVER EVER be back nor recommend it to anyone. I wish I could give this 0 stars for that alone.",

The steak itself makes up for that and then some or I'd have given this a lower rating. I'd say it's not like a \"Philly\" cheesesteak and you can probably get a better cheesesteak within the New York - Philly corridor, and maybe slightly outside of that area... But honestly, out on this side of the country where you can't bake good bread, it's the best you'll find for a thousand miles.

    "text": "In the worst of times people often think of the best of times.  Rex is no exception.  Gather around kids and let Uncle Rex tell you a story...when Rex was a small child he spent many a month on the East Coast. It was a magical time.  My father, who beat young Rex mercilessly if Rex called him anything but \"The Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora\", was originally from the Northeast.  My father was an odd man, a brutal man, a man with big dreams and small child like hands.  On my fifth birthday he brought Rex with him as he knocked over a 7-11.  As Rex helped him tie up the store clerk he let me pick any one thing Rex wanted in the store.  Young Rex wandered around the store, trying very hard to not step in the pools of blood, Rex saw the object he wanted...Rex turned and said \"Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora can Rex have THAT?\"  He nodded.  Rex kicked the 87 year old man laying on some of it...and picked it up. It was a bag with a delicious cheesesteak in it.  Rex danced. Rex smiled. Rex took the wallet of a crying soccer dad.  Rex was happy.  Rex and Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora drove down the street, the sound of sirens in the distance fading...the smell of the cheesesteak wafting into Rex's young nasal passages.  A great cheesesteak is a gift from above.  A wallet filled with 20 dollar bills and an unused condom...icing on the cake.  After we divided the ill gotten booty, Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora always took 70% (until I turned 9...but that is another story)...Rex ate his cheesesteak.  Perfect bread. Juicy shredded meat. Perfectly cooked onions. The right amount of whiz. Juice ran down Rex's chin. Juice ran down Rex's hands. Rex shook in delight. That memory, and the 8 months Rex spent on the run after Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora ratted him out...will always be with him.  Pops Philly Cheesesteak is not only an insult to that memory it is an insult to all things with meat, cheese, bread or even hot foods.  The front page of the their website has a picture of their pitiful attempt of a cheeesteak...one of one of their abominations has green pepper on it. GREEN PEPPER!!  Let me explain something to all of you who are not from Philly...IF there was a place in Philadelphia that put green bell peppers on their cheeseteak...THE CITIZENS WOULD BURN IT DOWN!!!  It is ABSOLUTLEY 100% NOT ALLOWED IN ANY PLACE IN PHILADELPHIA!! Even if asked they WILL NOT DO IT!  So, first and foremost this is NOT A PHILLY CHEESESTEAK PLACE!!! IT IS NOT! END OF STORY!  Apologies. Rex passed out and needed a shot of \"Happy Serum\" to get up right again...what is \"Happy Serum\" you ask...heathen...it is 1 part gasoline, 1 part peach schnapps, 1 part wiper fluid.   Anyway, now that we have established this is not a Philly cheesesteak, let's talk about it from a cheesesteak on it's own merits.  First, the rolls are good, the sad part is you can tell the bread is shipped frozen or frozen after it gets to Pops.  Big mistake. It really messes with the bread. It isn't bad, but again it isn't East Coast good.  Cheese...never enough. Never. If you get provolone instead of whiz it is almost non-existent. Shame on you for skimping on the cheese.  The Whiz isn't bad sometimes but more often than not there isn't enough.  The meat isn't bad. It is done well, with one BIG problem...it is often dry. Not enough oil or cooked and then recooked, whatever the reason it is not great.  If you get to Pops on the right day and get lucky, and order correctly, it isn't bad...but the overall consistency is not there.  Lastly...the \"Philly\" part of the menu...the Tastycakes, the birch beer, the rest of it...all WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! At Glaziers Market you can get all the stuff for 1/5th of the price.    Here is my biggest problem...Pop's plays on East Coast memories and locals who don't know any better. That is the biggest crime. It isn't Philly. It isn't a great cheesesteak. It is over priced. It is inconsistent. It just isn't right. It just isn't good.  Most of you will never know better unless you go back east (and my next review for Pizza will tell you how to find GREAT east coast food), and they KNOW you don't know. Pop's has been a place I have tried off and on for almost 8 years.  Rex wants to love it. Rex needs to keep trying every 2 years or so...but much like when his father turned him into the cops at the tender age of 5...Rex is always hurt by Pops. Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora and Pops...shame on you...you know better. Rex knows better. Rex deserves better. So does everyone else.",

All have been really good, but I love fried green beans so that hits this happy spot for me with sharing a Philly Whiz cheese steak. Very curious to try the bananas foster, fried okra and whiz wheels.  Open late so a plus for night owls like us. Since it's made piping hot to order, it's still nice and warm when we get home. You go to any other fast food and that crap is cold when we get home- another 10-15 minute drive on the FWY. MMM... night owls deserve something warm in the belly too.",

    "text": "Ok... Ive had enough. I will NOT go one more day with the reviews on here that aren't addressed. If you rate POPs below 4 stars; then you are a complainer. First of all; my favorite food on a piece of bread is The Cheesesteak. I have been to Philly on numerous occasions and have been to all the touristy spots Pats...Genos... Tony Lukes and out of those 3 Tony Lukes is by far the best. Pops is the best representation of Philly in Las Vegas.  The grillmaster makes all the difference. Steve is far and away the man on the grill. Yes, you have to speak up; the man is from Philly and he doesnt reward meekness or stupidity. I like that. Its not a 5 star restaurant. The sandwiches aren't cheap; this isn't a 99 special joint. If they are just recooking your meat then speak up. Ive only had fresh meat and chicken. He brings his Amorosos in from Philly... So for those of you that are from Philly and complain about the rolls: you know nothing. I will continue to seek out Cheesesteaks everywhere that I live and in Las Vegas, I found my spot once again. Its called Pops.",

Everything about it was bland.  I couldn't differentiate between the meat and the onions. It was weird. And the bread was awful- it was soft and did not taste like an Amoroso. Looks were most definitely deceiving. That said, the patio is great! And so were the sweet potato fries.",

Except this cowboy ain't packin' a Colt Six-Shooter, Pop's is packing meaty goodness wrapped in a tasty bread device.  I highly recommend the Philly cheesesteak with Cheez-Whiz!  The grilled onions and cheesy, oozy goodness will put you in an immediate good mood and cure any hangover.

The filling is cooked on a well seasoned griddle which picks up more flavor as the day goes on. The Cheese Whiz is plentiful. The fried zucchini were some of the best I have had. They are not freshly made, but the batter holds firm.   The cons: The meat and fixings was on the skimpy side. Some of the sides are worth the $3.95, but items such as the pretzel costing that much is ridiculous. Especially since they are so cheap to produce.   One item I am tempted to go back for is their breakfast philly. From 7am-10am, or something close to that, they run a special where it is only $5. That would be worth another visit.",

    "text": "The most legitimately Philidelphian Cheesesteak Joint in Las Vegas.  The way they select the meats for their sandwiches is superb. Fat and stringy beef, just like the ones in the East Coast when I was a child. When you chew your bites, the meat sort of falls apart and melts in your mouth. I have spent years trying to find the \"right cheesesteak\" in Nevada and California for ages.   The problem I noticed when it comes to ordering a cheesesteak in any place is not Philidelphia is that the establishment can't get the ingredients right. They usually love to bastardize the recipe with their \"lean, organic, and fat free\" ingredients that fuck up every aspect of the experience, the taste, texture, and even the look. I couldn't believe how many people can bungle a SIMPLE recipe of melt-in-your-mouth CHEESE... and steak.   A proper cheesesteak is a sloppy and messy one. Sort of like a Sloppy Joe, but cheesy. Its where the wrapping paper still has bits of that \"cheese paper\" still encrusted and stuck to the sides after you are done and you feel like you want to lick it off your fingers and the trash. Cheesesteaks should have a pungent, cheesy, and greasy odor that alerts the entire block within the vicinity of your possession of a good cheesesteak.   And many restaurants couldn't even get the basic concept of it right. I was about to give up in frustration until I looked online and found this place on Yelp. My first impression was, \"You guys are full of shit\", but I had extra money on me so I ordered a classic cheesesteak with fried okra.   After the first bite, I went into a epileptic seizure where I relived my best moments as a 6 year old, experiencing authentic Philly Cheesesteak for the first time as a kid. From what I was told by the hospital staff, the cooks found me lying on the sidewalk with yellow cheesy saliva foaming on the edges of my mouth, and paramedics picked me up to drop me off at Sunrise Hospital.   My diabetic stroke was worth it!",

In fact, I don't even like Geno's (sorry) and consider Jim's the only place for me whenever I'm in Philly.  For my first visit, I ordered the #32 mushroom & peppers with Provolone. What a hot, delicious mess! I'm glad I ordered it to go and ate it in my own kitchen. Seriously, the bread is a little too soft to support all the fillings. It was damn good otherwise, maybe needs a little mayo and/or ketchup for the \"salt\" factor. The meat seemed to be of good quality and I didn't end up gagging on any fat or gristle, thank god.   I will definitely be back for more, especially since I don't have to worry about the place closing before I get there. Open 24 hours and not McDonald's is a win in my book.",

Now no east coast guy so have no basis just local boy from the islands. I do know is lot of east coast peeps one was visiting from the islands. Always told me the key is cheese whiz if its  not very good then just not real deal philly. It been years since I came here just cause out of the way from my house. Years go by but somethings never change. Yay!!  I had the works with mushrooms. onions, and without question get me some cheese whiz. The meat perfect thinly sliced, cooked perfect, moist, hot, and top it with saute mushrooms/onions. The icing on the cake or this case philly. Cheese whiz. Hot! Cheesy, and enough whiz that it never ending cheese whiz down till your last bite. Not only last bite but know good cheese whiz all over your hands. The bread has nice crust on the outside, moist, and fresh baked bread feel. Put it all together nothing better too soak up long night of drinking at 3am Vegas style. Reasonable price for late night or anytime grubbing. Philly True Philly no room for sides. They have lot of different sides too choose from and not only steak can choose too make Philly. Really is there any other way then steak?? Think not.  The atmosphere without doubt not only adds so much too Pops with no True seating just open patio area and ideal place too hang out talk stories with friends. It open late at night. It perfect spot after long night drinking, hang out open area one that no need worry about shout over people have conversation with friends, and bonus get best Philly desert every seen!!!!",

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an authentic Philly cheese steak. the price was a little high but I will chalk that up to being as far away from Philadelphia is you possibly can without being on the West Coast and getting your ingredients from Philadelphia costs more. I will definitely be coming back here as I drive for Lyft and have to eat out quite often. I will also be telling my riders that this is an excellent place to eat",

It's more like a takeout. They have sitting area available. If you come here on a windy day like I did, the best place is your car to chow down the food. This place is located close to downtown Las Vegas so don't expect Strip like atmosphere if you know what I mean.  We ordered #1 whiz philly cheesesteak and some sweet potato fries. There's no best way to get a philly cheesesteak on photo. It's not the easiest photo to take. But the sandwich was soft, meat was cooked just right with right amount of whiz cheese. Sweet potato fries were very different from other places. It was pale orangey color with light salt and fresh tasting. It came with cinnamon water that you're supposed to pour over which we didn't know until later.  They take your order on the left side and when your order is ready you pay on the right side. Make sure you tip because \"the grill man can't go on a date.\" I'm assuming he doesn't have enough money. But whatever the reason is it's always nice to give some tip especially when the food is freshly made, excellent tasting, and cheap.",

The ordering window is now covered so you can't really watch them make the sandwiches anymore.  We got our food to go and waited for our order. It is outside, so be aware of the noise from traffic on Decatur.  The sandwiches are not bad, though they forgot my mushrooms. Hubby enjoyed his mozzarella sticks and the zucchini wasn't too soggy. Overall, I think we'll wait a bit to give them another try. I miss the mushrooms!!!",

    "text": "This review has been a year coming. I'd never had a Philly in my life, so my boyfriend decided to introduce me with Pop's. I ate a full cheese steak, an entire order of fried mushrooms, and then half an order of their fried banana bites (oh man, how I dream of those golden mouthfuls of deliciousness). Everything was absolutely killer, so much so that despite being stuffed, I was tempted to go back for another sandwich, you know, \"for later.\" I was in love.  One housebound night several weeks later, I was hit with a cheese steak craving. I ordered in from the highest rated delivery place I could find and was promptly let down.  Don't get me wrong, it was okay, but nothing more. Since then I've tried half a dozen sandwiches from as many restaurants and as it turns out, I don't crave cheese steaks; I crave Pop's. They set the bar high and ruined me for other places.  Beyond the food quality, the atmosphere is great. Open outdoor seating makes a great place to bring a casual date or good friends. It's fun and comfortable, with great service.  The only negative I can think of is that once a line forms, it doesn't let up. But I can't fault the place for doing good business. If anything, it's a testament to just how good Pop's is.",

I've been to a few in cali...but even their attitude is east coast here (not that i've ever been to philly haha).  I heard people ordering in philly on the food network....\"with or without\"  wasn't sure what it meant but i didnt wanna be foolish so i just said \"with\"  guess it means onions LOL.  I ordered the whiz cheesesteak and some wings.  they use the amarosa rolls from philly...shipped here from philly...and that is part of what makes the cheesesteaks good.  the wings flavor was pretty good...the wings themselves could be a bit crispier...but hey its not a wings joint...so good effort on the wings.  I hate the straws they use for their soda...thats my one beef.  i just noticed the coupon for 2nd steak at ,99 doh!  need to check with yelp more often!  seating is outdoor only...but has a neat back to the past feel....i wanna try their chili cheese pastrami next hahaha yummmmmm",

It is worth driving out of the way for, however, to satisfy my craving.  I always order the #2 Cheese Whiz Steak with onions. The gorgeous pictures on their menu always tempt me to order something different, but the memory of that gooey delicious cheese on top of tender steak just trumps all other urges. When it comes to sides, I've had the fried zucchini and the whiz wheels. The zucchini was alright. Nothing to write home about really. I didn't care for the whiz wheels. When asked what they were, they described them to be \"like fries.\" They're nothing like fries. Rather, they remind me of Asian shrimp chips.  The service isn't amazing. Half the time, the person working behind the grill is very inattentive; doesn't really greet you and merely waits for you to order without saying anything. The patio eating area is a bit run down. The stools aren't the most comfortable to sit on either, but I guess it's part of POP's charm.",

For a reward of  'FREE french fries' in which they did accept but that's just like cheating in my opinion. Where's the yelping officials on this one?  After working on the pops cheese steak truck for one day I realized this is not a steak and cheese at all. It's frozen meat \"NOT FRESH\" and they precook lots of that frozen meat and let it sit in water until ready to reheat for you to eat.  sound good I think not.   I won't get started on the sanitation of this place, pop's and pop's cheese steak truck must have it easy with the heatlh department because I don't even think he has soap on the truck for washing hands.   If I were you and looking for a steak and cheese I would look up other alternatives like some of these new food trucks around town like the \"Yellow Lunch Box Truck\" or \"Food Slingers\" in which they both serve fresh meat and it's even fresh rib eye. For a lower price as well.   The Vegas Villain",

I ordered the steak with whiz took a bite out of it and burnt my tongue ;(   Luckily I had a coke on stand by because it saved the rest of the meal :P  It's an out door eatery here, and the drive-thru order window is no more.  They have ceiling fan around the patio so air circulation is good.  The heat from tailpipe and cars on Decatur wasn't an issue, but the crosswalk bleeping noise was.  The steak are cooked already and sitting in a pan full of juice and goodness.  Once I order my steak they scoop a large amount and reheat it on the grill.  The steak was in the bread before I even paid.   Wow!  Came with a fork too.    Steak was good.. flavor was good, and the bread was really good!!  It was just enough, not too doughy.  Cost me about 10 bucks for a drink and steak with whiz.   Going to have to come back when I'm drunk to give it a real rating lol jk! :X",

First of all you have to have good bread and pops gets there bread flown in from Philadelphia Amoroso bakery in Philly is the best bread around that area.. pops uses the best bread in town. The meat on a scale of 1 to 10 is a 6. .they don't use fresh rib eye meat. They give a generous portion. They could put more cheese on there steak sandwiches... All in all its a decent philly chesesteak.  The grill isn't to clean and I often worry about how long the meat is kept warm in that pan...they cook the meat in advance and it lays in a pan of hot water for who knows how long. The employees are friendly. One time they forgot to give me my receit and according to there sign that posted right by the window where u pay 4 your food if they don't give u your receit you get your food for free... What I told the person at the cast hurts if they forgot to give me my receipt at first he tried to give me the receipt but i said said no its too late so he had to give me a free sandwich he wasn't too happy.....",

I've had them in Philadelphia and, I have to say, POP'S is so much better. The meat is to die for! It is cooked to perfection - juicy and full of flavor. The vegetables are cooked with the meat so the uber beef flavor envelops the vegetables like a warm blanket. Just like Pat's, they served Cheez Whiz. If you're not a fan, try it on the side first. The provolone cheese melts to a gooey goodness and covers every bit. The Amoroso bread is wonderful. It has a sturdy crust on the outside, light and airy on the inside. It has a subtle french/sourdough taste to it which works great with the steak. Thumbs up, way up!",

They load the sandwiches up with lots of meat and whatever else you'd like. So they make it worth it... I usually get the pork BBQ sandwich and who ever I'm with usually gets a Philly cheese steak and we are all always satisfied!!",

It was my first hoagie since actually GOING to New Jersey and getting my first hoagie ever! It wasn't bad, but maybe my expectations were higher than they should be. I mean, we aren't actually in Philly so I shouldn't expect the hoagie to taste like we are. But it wasn't bad either. It was pretty good. But the price was a bit high for the quality. $10 for an Italian Hoagie was wasn't as big as the picture made it look and bread that didn't hold up well to the oils after time in the fridge But again, I might just have way too high expectations after having a REAL Philly hoagie.",

    "text": "Wow!  Just had lunch at Pops. We lived outside of Philadelphia for 9 years, we feasted on Philly cheese steak sandwiches regularly, sampling different ones around the city and surrounding area...and...drumroll....Pops was better!!!  We are huge Capriotti's fans and it just so happens their second restaurant was in Kennet Square, PA where we lived. We were thrilled when they came out west. So whenever we are in Vegas we eat there. We decided to try Pops on our way out of town today.  We are so glad we did. We had #32 with provolone. I can't stand fatty meat, I gag on it. This was perfectly lean yet tender and moist. I never thought I could eat the whole sandwich but I did as it was so delicious. A guy in line told me that their chili is great too. He goes there for the chili cheese fries.  Don't be discouraged by the appearance, it's a dive, yet all the tables were clean, etc.   Enjoy...we sure did!",

It was pretty busy that night and I waited for a good 20-30 mins before they took my order.   We tried the peppers & mushroom cheesesteak and the cheese whiz cheesesteak. Also two orders of whiz fries.   We split the cheesesteaks in half so we can try both. I tried half of the peppers & mushroom and half of the cheese whiz. Peppers & mushrooms is really good, I recommend 8/10! Great amount of filling inside and bread was so good. All it needed was a bit of salt imo. The cheese whiz is really cheesy and good, but a bit too salty for me, 6/10. It can get messy because of the cheese.  Cheese whiz fries were bomb dot com!! 10/10  After paying, if you like hot sauce, make sure to ask the cashier for hot sauce because that stuff is amazing. I have a feeling it could be a hot sauce from a bottled sauce we know, but cant pinpoint which one. Either way, taste great in the cheesesteak & with the fries!  :-)",

I just knew it was going to be an great food experience.  Ordered the #9 and the chili cheese  fries. As always when I have an negative review I never bash or criticize the food.  So since the mob was a great part of Vegas. I'm going to use an analogy from a great mobster movie. My experience turned out like Joe Pesci's experience did in the movie Goodfellas when they shot him in the head down in the basement. I just knew that Pop Philly cheesesteak was going to make me a made man. Instead I  got shot in the head and there was nothing I could do about it.",

    "text": "I'm not known for being a cheese steak fan, but I do love cheese. Add in that this place is about a mile from home for me, and that it's 24 hours, and it's pretty much kismet that I would finally come here and actually really like it.  First off, its a bit  pricier than expected: spent $25 on dinner for me and the BF. As others have said though, the sandwiches are beyond huge enough to share.  We got the #32 peppers and onions cheesesteak with provolone ($11), added on sides of chili cheese fries ($4) and an order of wings (10 for $8), and a Franks black cherry soda ($2).  For the price, the sandwich and wings were good portions. I didn't think the same thing about the soda or fries though- but then again, I'm not a soda person in the first place, though I understand this brand is apparently something special.  The sandwich itself, in addition to being huge, was stuffed full of meat and veggies. The cheese was a little light for my liking, and it was slightly on the dry side toward the ends of the sandwich, but it was good. In the future, I'd probably stick to the mushroom one though. The chili cheese fries were fairly standard and a smaller portion than I expected but we still devoured them in record time. The wings, though, were a surprise. I ordered the mild ones rather than hot, and still found these to be surprisingly spicy. I'd definitely hesitate before ordering their \"flamin'\" style, I can't imagine how much hotter they must get. Portion was good for the price, wings were an average size without being too small or overly fried or breaded. Huge portion of ranch for dipping. I liked how easily the meat came off the bone, too. A little less messy than usual.   We ate at the patio area, and it was noisy and difficult to carry on conversation, as others have said. However, it wasn't a total turn off and in fact kind of added to the experience. I'll have to come back and try the sweet potato fries...and the breakfast sandwiches... maybe I'll add the Whiz next time, too.",

    "text": "Pop's Philly Steaks are some of the best Philly Cheesesteaks in Las Vegas. This place is open 24/7 with very limited parking.  Pops Philly Steaks is located off of the 95/Decatur exit. A few blocks down, sits at a small intersection. There is a large sign for Pops Philly Steaks, so you can't miss it. There is limited parking, so, just be aware of the availability if you are coming during peak times such as lunch time during the week-day or dinner.  This is a order at the restaurant and pick up your meal when your name/order is called. There is a variety of tables and benches for you to sit on at Pops Philly Steaks. All table seating is covered as well, but just note that all seating is outdoors. It can be hot, especially, if you're going during mid-day during the summer.   My family and I ended up getting the following  [1] Philly CheeseSteak with Provolone [1] Philly CheeseSteak with Cheeze Whiz [1] Mozzarella Sticks [1] Fried Mushrooms [1] Chicken wings [7 count]  Both Philly Cheesesteaks had the meat, onions and cheese. Due to the type of orders, all of the food came out rather sporadically. The Philly Cheesesteaks came out first. I had ordered the Philly CheeseSteak with Provolone. It was delicious! I had tried my boyfriend's Philly CheeseSteak with Cheeze Whiz. It was amazing! Between the two, I actually preferred the Cheeze Whiz over the Provolone. It gave the Philly Cheesesteak more of a bang and added a variety of additional flavors. The bread was a perfect touch.   The Mozzarella Sticks were deep fried and not too loaded with the breading. The sticks were thin, not thick. We had received the order hot out of the kitchen, so the cheese was still melted and mixed well with their Marinara sauce provided.  The Chicken wings were really good! My daughter enjoyed them thoroughly. The wings were good sized, not too small and not too large. It was crispy on the outside, and not overdone. There wasn't too much breading and there was more chicken then breading on the wing, which is great as well!  The meal came out to approximately $40.00 which included [3] drinks and a bag of chips. Well worth the amount of food, and great food quality!",

Flavour: 6/10 -- if it weren't for the cheese wiz, the lack of flavour in the meat would be very obvious. Size: 10/10 -- I was able to split it into two separate servings.  They do have a wide variety of sandwiches to choose from and the cheese wiz is yummy (if they remember to put it on the first time).  I got mine to-go last Friday and it was about 11:30 at night.  The wait time was brief as there were only a few customers at that time, but I'd much prefer waiting longer to get what I asked for vs. having to drive all the way back to get it done the right way.  They offered me a new sandwich or a drink for the trouble, but 1. I don't like to waste food (I just asked them to add the cheese on top) and 2. I already had a drink that I purchased.  Hopefully next visit they will get it right the first time around.",

The customer service is good they help you figure the philly that you'll like. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars because the fries were soggy instead of crispy and philly didn't have any mayo. Maybe original Phillys don't come with mayo but without it, the sandwich is a bit dry. That's okay I'll request how I like it next time.

So after 20 plus years, tonight I did. The outside patio is cool and has a old school vibe to it. The seats would be something you find at a 50s diner. For my first time, looking at the selections wasn't daunting. I ordered the number 7. Basic cheesesteak with peppers and onions.....I decided to eat it outside. Yeah was still 102 out, but didnt feel that bad. My order was ready within 10 minutes. The service was good, friendly. The cheesesteak was pretty good. Peppers were a little sweet, but the bread was great and the meat was tender and juicy. My fries were cooked right, and it was a good meal. Seemed a bit pricey, but I'm all about supporting local businesses. Good food, good vibe, and good decision I ate here finally before I went home.",

    "text": "This tiny cheesesteak stand is hard to miss and I have driven past it for years. Finally stopped by and I see why there is always a line outside. Good food at a low price.   Important info: parking is a pain. Outdoor seating only. Always because of their ordering system. The line does go pretty quick though. Not good for more than 4 people in a group because the stools and tables are all stationary so you can't get together. A group of 6 of us went and a few of us stood around the table but it was tight.   All that aside I thought the food was very good. Cheesesteaks either the best or very close to the best in Las Vegas and for $8 or $9 (depending on the toppings) you can't beat it.   The steak was really flavorful and with cherry peppers and onions on a really solid hoagie roll was a solid move. I could easily eat one myself, but my wife and I could have split one and shared an appetizer.  Speaking of appetizers:  Mozzarella sticks were about the same as low quality frozen ones.  Buffalo cauliflower bites were surprisingly good. I don't usually enjoy cauliflower, but these were really good.  The pretzel with orange honey butter was interesting. The pretzel was still cold so not good there. But the butter was delicious. If they had just cooked the pretzel so I could dip the warm pretzel in that yummy honey butter I'd be all about that, but the undercooked and still ice cold pretzel wasn't appetizing.  All that said if I needed a late night quick bite in the area I'd stop by and get a cheesesteak and fries. I don't think I'd make the 20 minutes drive from my house or go out of my way, but I'd be happy to go back again.",

The bread was soft, but not too soft. The cheese, cheesy and gooey. Onions cooked well and it all tied together for a fantastic late night splurge. My only complaint was the the cook went heavy on the salt. Doubt if its a continuous thing . . . just that night he shook the container too much.",

    "text": "For authentic Philly Cheesesteaks, POP's is the best place to fill your cheesesteak craving, whether it is at 12pm, 4am, or whenever since this place is open 24/7. This popular local joint sits on the corner of Alta and Decatur. It is really hard to pass it with its vintage looking POP's sign that sits on top of this corner stand. The parking lot is small so be prepared to park on the street or wait for parking during busy times. Everything is made to order and you can peek through to watch the grill master at work. Beware, it gets pretty hot though. There are various cheesesteaks to choose from and side dishes such as sweet potato fries, fried okra, fried cauliflower, zucchini sticks and many many more. For those who want their cheesesteak fix but want to be a little healthier, they have a cheesesteak salad so you don't have to feel too guilty. And if you can't decide, there are pictures for all you visual people. PRESENT! After you have ordered you can enjoy the sights and do some people watching from their outside seating area. There are some high tops and low tops. During the summer days there are misters so you don't have to eat in the heat. Prices are more than reasonable since the cheesesteaks are enormous.   Tips: Please tip the grill master as he has no friends and can't get dates. (That's what the tip jar says anyways).",

Ok, the cheese steak itself:  the meat was not fatty or greasy, but slightly bland.  I enjoyed the cheese whiz and the bread was very good.  I think if they had included the onions, things would have been tastier.  Also, in the hours since eating the steak, I have been a bit 'indisposed', but this in and of itself has never been an index of whether I would return to a place if the food tastes good.  (masochist!)  So all in all, I think I would try it again probably.  But I'll also try their competition in town and yelp the results.  :)",

    "text": "BOY!!!! This place is off the chain. Open 24 hours? Man you can't beat that. I simply LOVE this place. Why the 4 stars you ask, well for one thing I really didn't like their pastrami fries and yes it was enough to bump it down one star. For one thing I strongly believe that if a business/restaurant deserves 5 stars, you better believe that everything they serve and their customer service is top notch. And I failed to believe everything on the menu was good, but you better believe that their philly cheese steaks are probably the best I've tried in LV and in the Bay Area.  The first time I was here I ordered the philly cheese steak with bacon and swiss #9. It was just as good as advertised and just as good as it looked while the cook was making it. I also ordered the cheese whiz fries and boy was that also yummy. I also ordered fried 'shrooms, and those little mouth watering bites were simply just awesome. It was the first time I tried anything mushroom fried in batter, and I was damn glad this place was my first. The second time I ate here I ordered the pizza philly cheese steak.....mmmmm, was that yummy it was like ordering on of my two favorite things and smashing it into one nice juicy hoagie. I also ordered cheese whiz fries again, but this time I had the master cook add some bacon in it, man was that good.  If I really had more time to spend in Las Vegas, I sure would come here a few more times and try more off the menu. I also love the fact that this place is open 24 hours. With me being on Vegas party time and coming home about 3 or 4 in the morning after the casino, this place just becomes a savior.  Thank goodness for Pops Philly Steaks open 24 hours and its yummy juicyness of flavorful cheeeeeeese steaks. Keep up the good work guys, when I'm back in town you better believe I'll be back for more! It's like philly cheese steaks from heaven. YUM!",

It's the only cheese steak establishment I've ever seen in sin city so I thought I'd give it a try and I'm sure glad I did.  It's just a really good cheese steak.  That's all there is to it.  The bread is soft but not too soft.  The steak is cooked just like it would be in Philly and the toppings are plentiful and tasty.  There's also many different variations to choose from like the cheese, peppers, onions, and what kind of sauces you want on it.  I always go steak 'wit' provolone, peppers and onions.  Writing this review right now makes me want one.  I guess I'll have to settle for Philly's Best tonight, but that's another review.",

No question about it, if you're looking for authentic Philly cheesteaks, this is the place. Anyone who doesn't like these sandwiches also wouldn't like Pat's or Geno's or Jim's from Philly.",

    "text": "It's good and the sodium levels are not as high as other places. You can really taste the flavor of the beef but if it cools down then it'll start to taste kind of bland, it's better to eat it right away while it's hot. I love how it's 24/7 and the staffers are friendly. I usually get a #4, #6, #34 and I have yet to try # 32. If you want an awesomely tasting cheese steak but without the added sodium (salt) then I would highly recommend POP's.  Sometimes I get the Chilli Cheese fries with pastrami which is also good but can make you kinda heavy.  Some say the cheese steak is bland but that's because there isn't as much salt like other places which can really alter the flavor/taste of the cheesesteak., so if your lookin out to have more foods with less salt then I recommend this place.  I don't think the drive through actually works to get your order, I mean I went to POP's like 33 times and it doesn't look like they actually take orders in the drive through, if they did, i'd probably give POP's another star.",

I love the building though (it's an old converted Wienerschnitzel) and the neon and logo.  They do have Tastykakes and Frank's sodas (!), so if you are craving some Black Cherry Wishniak, Pop's is your go-to place.  I'll try Pop's again maybe and get the provolone instead of the whiz, but my initial assessment is that there are better cheesesteaks in this town.  Most of the other reviews already have the alternatives covered.",

By kind of blah I mean they weren't necessarily bad but they weren't great either. I understand its a small place to not have indoor seating but if you are going to only have outdoor seating you need to have a drive-thru too in my opinion. I went on a pretty chilly day and had to stand outside to wait for my cheesesteak. Worth the wait for sure but they would probably do more business if you could sit or even order indoors. I don't know about you but I don't exactly enjoy standing outside when its 30 degrees in winter or 120 in summer. And when its windy and you are trying to eat outside everything is blowing all over the place. They aren't something you really want to eat in your car either (can be messy).   The Philly Steaks are by far the closest I have had to Philly out here. I'm from the Northeast and these are pretty close if not right on the money (its been a while since I've been to Philly).   Overall - looking forward to my next visit but I will make sure its a nice day out.",

Very authentic, you can definitely taste the freshness. Prices are good. I think I spent around $12 after-tax buying a bottle water along with the cheesesteak. Must try place in Vegas.

This is another area of Vegas where I'm afraid to get out of my car.  The huge iron fences on the windows when you order from here says it all - this neighborhood is crap.  Don't kill me people but, I am not a fan of the cheese whiz on these sandwiches, as I think it completely ruins the flavor.  But I am a fan of provolone.  One thing I should mention is that they had soft pretzels on the menu when we were there last time.  My husband, who orders soft pretzels pretty much everywhere he goes wanted one, and was informed him they took these off the menu, because no one really orders pretzels at a cheesesteak place.  They went in back anyhow and dug one up for him and warmed it up with some of the cheese wiz on the side.  Very cool of them to do that.",

I was so pissed off because by driving by it looks like a place that would have great food and its always busy, So i decided to try this place I felt ripped off it was way over priced for lousy food.   PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, do not eat here if you like good food especially if your use to traditional Philly steaks!",

I came here with my boyfriend a few nights ago to try it out. There was nobody there except for one worker who was cleaning up the eating area.  We walked over to the menu to figure out what we wanted. We decided to get the #32 (mushroom/bell peppers/steak/cheese) to share with a side of chili cheese fries. I liked that you could watch the person making your food for you, there was even a sign that invited you to do so. The guy made our order pretty quickly and we took a seat at one of the high tables.   First we tried the chili cheese fries, which was delicious. I love cheese whiz! Then we both took half of the cheesesteak and began eating. I knew it was Bomb after the first bite. It tasted even better after I stuffed some chili cheese fries in it! Yes, I know that sounds unhealthy, but I don't care! lol.  All in all, this place was good. The worker could've been more engaging though. He didn't talk or smile at all, which made us not want to go back to the counter to order dessert. We just felt like we were bothering him or something, even thought there was no one else there.  I'll definitely come back next time I'm in need of a late night bite!",

    "text": "You're supposed to go for the whiz, but I was wooed by their patio. There is no interior dining here, and no, the patio is not fancy, but while I was chewing on my wonderfully soft hoagie stacked with meat and cheese, I couldn't help but admire this mildly grimey but charming outdoor eating arrangement. I felt like I was on an adventure in another country, anonymous, unable to speak the language, and unexpectedly eating a Philly cheese steak. It was wonderful. Sometimes a place just transports you, and for some reason Pop's was that place on that Saturday afternoon.  I admired their plethora of fried offerings from okra to green beans to mushrooms and zucchini. Alas, the only thing I could sell my husband on were the sweet potato fries. I didn't want to consume an entire heap of fried okra alone, so we went with those. We shared a steak hoagie with American, not whiz, and onions and peppers.   The sandwich was solid. The star was definitely the roll. And, the sweet potato fries were as good as any I have sampled, especially because they were served so hot that I could feel my fingers melting beneath the wax paper. I was tempted to pour their magic coconut water sauce all over them, but I showed restraint. If you are braver, definitely pour away and let me know the results.   I of course adore the building and the fact that they are open 24 hours. I am sure we will have a 3am cheese steak sometime in the near future, and when it gets cooler, I will definitely go back for the unexpectedly charming patio.",

Don't understand the complaints about the prices, i think for what you get its fine.....We didn't bother eating outside since it's too damn hot this time of year, so we just brought everything home and it was pretty darn good....

POPS is open 24 hours and the sandwiches and sides here are just so yummy!!!!  The sandwiches are made to order, and are great! I usually get the chili fries or deep fried okra as a side to go with my sandwich.   It's an outdoor walk-up orders type kind of place. Open outdoor seating. It's in a convenient location near Meadows Mall, right on Decatur. Easy to drive pass this place, but I'm sure you won't miss the huge POPS writing on the roof!   Parking lot is small, but there always a spot you can get since they are super fast with getting orders made.   Don't worry for those who are not really into philly cheese steak sandwiches, they have salads and chicken and other options as well. So there's always something that everyone can order.   This is a place that i highly recommend!!! Well worth your $10-15!",

Some may think $9.99 is pricey but it's not for the size, amount of fillings and the flavor. They make it right in front of you and they have an awesome menu of variations and sides. It's patio dining which works best for evening and overnight dining. They do not have a drive thru but service is very fast. This location is 24 hrs which is a blessing for late night runs; I'm glad I moved back to this side of town. With their Philly's and wings, they have seriously changed my Sunday morning Football plans... I can dine in at home!",

They use sirloin so there isn't any grizzley pieces. I topped mine with cheese whiz. Props on them layering steak, cheese, steak so the cheese gets evenly distributed!   Menu was extensive. I wish I was drunk and not eating here on my lunch hour so I could have gotten a little more into some of the cool things (fried bananas foster? Cheese whiz wheels?).   I mean I guess the atmosphere is \"authentic\", but dining literally 2 feet from Decatur isn't all that great .

For starters, the food is cooked in front of you and visible through the window. When you receive your food, it's warm and ready to be devoured. Another great aspect of this place is the amount of meat that you get for the price. The Philly steak's is between $6-10 and I believe is properly priced. Another positive aspect is that this place is 24hrs. After a long night at Vegas and there is a need for cheap grub, this is a good place to check out.  Now for the things I didn't like about this place. For one thing, I enjoy my Philly steaks with a little kick of hot sauce. There is a small charge for hot sauce. Yeah I know $.50 is not expensive, but come on now, a charge for hot sauce. Secondly, side orders are extra. Who gets Philly steaks without fries or something? These negative is very minor, bit it did disturb me a little bit.  Overall, I would rate this place a 3 1/2 star but because I don't have that option it gets 4 stars. This place is one little spot that needs to checked out of your tired of going to the typical Vegas buffet's and restaurants.",

Average hoagie bun. Cheese wiz was good but who am I kidding cheese wiz is always good. Not impressed at all with this place and I will not be back. Even if I am faced I will walk past this place I am 90% sure... Haha",

I order a sandwich and fries for around $14.00 bucks.  So I just ate my food... The following thoughts cross my mind... 1) WAAAAAY OVERRATED  2) WAAAAY OVERPRICED 3) SUPER DUPER GREASY ( in a bad way) 4) I CAN'T BELIEVE I JUST WASTED CALORIES ON THAT SH*T 5) DAMN YOU MISLEADING FALSE 5 STAR YELPERS!! 6) WHY DID I GO SOLEY ON AVERAGE TOTAL STARS? READ THE REVIEWS WOMAN!  I tried this place and can absolutely positively say I won't be making an encore appearance- EVER!  I have had a better sandwich at Great Steak at the mall or maybe even Starbucks. Right now I am really regretful to have wasted a meal here wishing I would have gone to Subway or IN and OUT instead. Seriously, this place had a piece of dry whatever bread which a bunch of overly greasy crap in it. No special flavor, delightful texture, wonderful aroma, extra special something..NADA. The only reason this place is getting two stars is because the fries were decent and well done( which I like) but still average.  Also, although the cook was extremely friendly and helpful he handled the money and then went directly to cooking without washing his hands or wearing gloves. Can we say GROSS or FLU?  Help me help you. Don't let my review go in vain. I'm trying to do a public service here. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEEEEASE don't fall for the hype and avoid this place. If for whatever reason you must visit go for some side orders and be on your way.",

Well, it might not be at an ideal intersection or neighborhood but I'm always down for a good Philly!  I've gone here 4 times (could of been much more but its kinda far from me) and this is what I've tried:  Provolone Cheese Steak, Mushroom Cheese Steak, Peppers with Mushroom Cheese Steak and Cheese Whiz Steak  = All Excellent!!  Fries: the fatter type when you can actually taste the potato! Must have with their cheese steaks!  * Bread is made and flown from Philly, Sirloin Steak is cut, marinated, packaged and shipped from Philly, Wisconsin and New Jersy Cheeses but the Kraft Cheese Whiz is manufactured from Philly..... Did I mention that they get most of their stuff from Philly??!!!!! Can you say Authentic??!! Well, this place saves me from flying to Philadelphia to grab a cheesesteak because whatever their doing here, their doing it genuinely right!!  If you want a Real and Excellent Tasting Philly Sandwich that'll fill you up for a fair price then I suggest trying this place out!",

    "text": "Once upon a time, this place was a Straight From Philly Steakout. (Then again, once upon a time it was a Weinerschnitzel & then it was a Weanie Bender, but that's beside the point. :-D ) When it turned into Pop's, I wanted it to be as good as Philly Steakout, which I miss terribly. They largely kept the same menu, after all. However it is not quite as good.  Don't get me wrong, it's still pretty decent. I still come here from time to time. And of course, middle of the night dining options are always good. However, the phillys aren't quite as tasty as their predecessor's. It seems like maybe they really love oregano. A lot. Like, really a lot. That appears to be the main flavoring that they use to distinguish themselves from other philly joints. Chicken phillys are better, not so over seasoned. I really want to love the cheese fries, but at least when I go there in the evenings the old, old fries are just thrown back in the fryer for you. Now I know that some places double-fry their fries. However, if you double-fry really old fries, you just get nasty over cooked & over greased fries. It's a consistent thing here. Perhaps during the daytime I'd have better luck w/ the fries.  Also, I've witnessed several times where people will go from money handling to directly touching food. Not a cool thing. Soo, yeah. Not terrible, but just ok.",

Sitting at It's a Grind coffee shop on desert inn and durango at 3am, a couple stumbles in, orders, and bumps into me. As a rather \"fluffy\" guy, they asked if I knew anywhere for food and open late. I suggested Porchlight behind of the coffee shop, Girl 1 says I wants fried cheese, Girl 2 said steak and onions, I say \"cheesesteak perhaps?\" The couple then proceeds to say, \"Follow us!!\" I seriously got a little scared on the way there, kind of out of my comfort zone of West Vegas...but I'm here to say, TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!  I ordered a regular cheesesteak with onions, half provolone, half cheese whiz, peppers, and onion rings as a side. SO GREAT, best cheesesteak i've ever had. Other notables are the fried zucchini, fried cheese, and hot wings. The menu is huge so take your time. I was rushed because the couple assumed I've been here before, put me in the front of the line.  Service was excellent, cook laughed at the randomness of our story.  Get out there and try a TRUE philly. So great.",

There's a walk-up window where you order and pay for your food. The service is nothing special; not horrible but not the greatest, either. The guy that took our order was also the cook, and he makes the cheesesteaks right in front of you.  Both, my husband and I, decided on the #2 Cheese Whiz Steak  w/grilled onions (the onions don't automatically come with, so be sure to ask for them), and an order of fried okra and onion rings.   Cheesesteaks: The bread was nice and soft and held up well to the decent amount of filling. The meat, on the other hand, was kind of dry and lacking in flavor - it needed some seasoning.   Fried okra and onion rings: They were both perfectly fried and not too greasy, but they're the frozen stuff that you get at the store.  All in all, not a bad place, but I've had better.",

The only downside was that it was scorching hot outside when we came here to eat and we were sweating while trying to enjoy our food.  They also serve Italian shaved ice here to cool you off but we didn't try it..  Good idea though.

The philly's are huge and they make them right in front of you however you like them. It gets pretty busy there, but is definitely worth the wait.   Oh and parking kinda sucks when it gets busy. I always feel bad parking in front of people's houses when there's no parking available in the small lot. I assume the people that live in those houses are used to it since Pops has been there forever!",

Hands down the best cheese - steak sandwich in the greater Las Vegas area. They take their beef and season it with a flavorful mix of spices and herbs while they grill it up. The beef is never greasy always tastey and then served on a toasted, warm bun. Then they give you the perfect amount of cheese to meat ratio and serve it to you with a side of fries and drink if you choose. They are also open late for those of you who have a late night craving or are coming out of the club. This will curb any craving and your only regret is that you didn't buy 2.",

Everything probably would've tasted much better had the weather been warmer and indoors.  This place has only outdoor seating.  It's been around.  The cool thing about this place is that they make sure they get your order right and give you your receipt.  If they don't, your food is free.  It's stated on the wall...

The giant triangular building has been serving up Philly's 24/7 for years now and has become a local favorite. Pop's exudes that hole in the wall atmosphere and really belongs on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives. Yes the Ben Franklin mural has seen better days but for me this mildly grimey look just adds to the experience. There is no in door seating just the outdoor patio so dress accordingly. They menu is pretty big, tons of philly variations along with plenty of deep friend snacks and TastyKakes (you get a free one on your birthday!)  I am sure the guys here can produce a edible work of art with the cheez wiz but I was a little disappointed in what I got. My bacon philly and a bottle of water came out to twelve bucks; for the price I expected more. The philly was surprisingly dry and lacking flavor. Normally adding bacon to any dish is an improvement but here it just added a rubbery textured ingredient to otherwise soft sandwich. The hoagie looked great at first but became soggy and fell apart as it soaked up the grease. I've heard rumors that the place was sold a few years back had hasn't been the same since.   I might have ordered the wrong thing or just been there on a off day so I am willing to give the place another shot. Perhaps until next time.",

    "text": "Some background: I have lived in and around Philly for 29 years, and just moved to Las Vegas in July. I used to live down Passyunk from Pat's and Geno's, and for the last 4 years I lived near the Dalessandro's (the real king of Philly steaks). Soooo I think I am fairly qualified to give this review.  After finding out that Pop's was a short drive from my office, I decided to head down there to devour thousands of delicious calories in one sitting. I wish I saved those calories for something better. What a disappointment!!   I asked for my go-to, a cheesesteak hoagie (typically it's steak, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion). He told me mayo was included, and I told him no mayo please. After waiting 5 minutes for my steak, I get it in a paper bowl thing with a fork stuck on top. Never saw that before... Sat down, pulled apart my steak to put ketchup in there, and I realized the thing is slathered in mayo. NASTY. Brought my steak back to the counter, told the woman at the register about the mistake, and they made me another. I had to get this to go since I needed to be back at work. Back at my office, I take a bite of my steak and there is some kind of vinegar flavoring in the hoagie. I don't know if the onions were cooked in it or if the guy thought this would be good or if was just suffering from temporary insanity.... Ugh. I ate it, but only because I paid $14 with a drink and chips.   First, the prices were a little much for what you're getting. My cheesesteak hoagie was $10. I used to pay $8 at Dalessandro's. It's $6.50 at Dalessandro's for a plain steak and it's $8 at Pop's. The quality was a 2 star compared to Dalessandro's 5 star, so confused on the mark up of price. Maybe because the rolls are shipped from Amaroso's?   If you've never had a Philly steak, I can see why you might like these. If you have experienced the best of the best, you will walk away disappointed. Between the price, flavor, and authenticity, I won't be returning.",

Both times we went and ordered our food they screwed up our sandwiches. Mine was a philly with mushrooms and peppers. NO ONION.  I went up and told them there was a mistake so being that it was 11pm and pretty cold. My boyfriend was eating his food and I had to watch.  Okay well he tells me it was really flavorless.  How do you kill the flavor of the meat?   I had to completely agree when my order was ready 7 minutes later... I went for a bite and expected there to be gooey cheese on it and SOME seasoning. Nope.  It was so bland I couldn't eat the rest of it and decided the second try was the  LAST TRY.  I don't get it, we came at all the way out from our side of town to try it.  We even went as late like everybody's recommended. Still awful service. Not to mention the two guys working were miserable.  I rather spend the money and go to Green Valley's Buffet and have them make me a Philly COOK TO ORDER.  At least there the meat was juicy, flavorful and I could SEE what the hell they're up to in the kitchen.",

Got a #2 Cheese Whiz steak sandwich and some onion rings.  Greasy?  Yes.  Pricey?  A bit.  Good?  No doubt.  It was pretty darn good.  The onion rings were good thick onion rings, and a fair price of 3.95 for what they gave you.  I got a free side of ranch with that, no complaints there.  Food came out minutes after ordering, took it home and devoured it.  For 15 bucks overall, I got my money's worth and a full stomach.  Limited parking as it sits on a corner, outdoor undercover seating only on tall diner stools and tables.  Reminds me of the old snack bar days at the baseball fields as a kid.

    "text": "Terrible customer service from the large man behind the counter!  I drove in at around 9:30 to get one of the sandwiches, that they are currently promoting on a couple of large scale banners hanging out side of their establishment. I thought what a good deal for a sandwich only 6 bucks n i could get a nice breakfast snack, but all i ended up getting was an attitude from some guy who for some reason decided to fight with me. I went to inquire about said sanwich and was quickly cut off by him saying \"we dont have no 6 dollar phillies, not ever.\" (Noting that the sign  specifically reads breakfast phillies, steak, bacon, or ham phillies.) To wit I replied, \"no I'm talking about your sandwiches on the sign\" at which point the Genius behind the counter puts his brain in high gear and repeats \"We dont got any phillies for 6 bucks.\" its like no sh!t Sherlock! Thank you so much for explaining to me that you only have a slight grasp of this thing called communication, how enlightened I am now to the fact that you do not sell 6 buck phillies, and thank you ever so much for the attitude of treating me like I was a 5 year old instead of using commen sense and telling me about the sandwiches I was inquiring about. I left with nothing other then anger, fustration, and a bad taste in my mouth from your customer service skills. Perhaps look elsewheres for your morning meal or you may have to fight with him as well!  update: tried them out again for the first time in a year and got a totally f#d up case of food poisoning ughhh they used to be so good...",

    "text": "I  had been wanting to try Pop's for the longest time.  And every time I drive by the colorful stand, I think to myself \"Why on God's green earth have I not been there yet?\".  Well, all this anticipation contributed to the big let down.    I love anything authentic.  And supposedly all of the ingredients (rolls, cheese, meat) are flown in directly from Philly itself. I ordered the provolone mushroom cheesesteak, and it was just OK.  Maybe I needed to order the cheese whiz to make it more authentic, but I just can't bring myself to eat something that artificially bright yellow.   The roll was definitely piled high with the tender meat.  I only ate half because it was so filling.  But it wasn't as seasoned or flavorful as I was expecting it to be.  The mushrooms added some flavor, but that was it.  Perhaps I am just not a phillycheesesteak type of girl.   There were 2 people ahead of me in line, so there was a bit of a wait. I am just grateful I went in the spring and not in the middle of summer.  I doubt i will have any cheesesteak cravings any time soon, but it is comforting to know that if I do have one, they are open 24 hours.  *Yelp 100 Challenge: Review 26/100*",

The cheesesteak comes in several varieties including wit whiz, american, provelone, and cheddar.  The steak is flavorful and grilled right before your eyes.  I would avoid the sides though, not only are they prepackaged items like zucchini sticks, mozzerella sticks, mushrooms, etc, but they are all fried in the same oil.  They did not look good. Still the sandwich is one of the better philly cheesesteaks in Las Vegas so give it a try.",

Provolone oozing off the sandwich. Give me anything with cheese that oozes and I'll dive in, face first. Jalapeno poppers were good too! Not super spicy, but hits the spot.   They make every sandwich to order, and take one order at a time at the window, so the wait can get long, but it is so worth it!   Love the vibe of this place. All outdoor covered patio seating.

And it was really really slimy inside. Yes I know it's okra... But when they are fried well... The sliminess goes away and sadly this was not the case for them.  So sad as I love love me some fried okra. Flavor (2/5)  I also got the fries and they were just fries. Not really crispy.... Kinda sad soggy fries. My bf liked the fact that they gave ranch with it.... But eh... Flavor (2/5)....I would've given it 1 star but since my bf loved the ranch I gave then another star for the ranch. :/  For the main course I got the #6... The Philly with mushrooms and cheese.... OK... The bread was freaking awesome! Perfect chew and softness... Just perfect. BUT the meat... Mushrooms and onions were really really under seasoned. It was very blah. I mean the Philly cheese steak at subway tasted better then this. :( very disappointing since this is what they are known for. (2/5)... And that is being generous.   Service was OK... Nothing mind blowing....(2/5)  Ambiance was.... It's a mom and pop type store.... So it was kind of ghetto.... Without the cutesy stuff that u normally see in a mom and pop... And no bathroom at all either (1/5)  Will I be returning.... Most likely no.... One it is too far and for the price there are other things that I would rather eat.  The prices for the sandwiches ranged from $10 and up and the Specialty sides were $4.... And as nothing that I had made me want to have another bite....I don't think I'll be returning. :(",

Once I have it, I'm good for months.   The food is always already precooked and I can understand that for busier rush times but that doesn't make sense when you show up here around 2 or 3 in the morning. The location is also a little scary being on a busy corner in a shady area and there's no indoor seating.   With all that said I love the super thinly sliced steak and this place has been around since 2002 with an old school vibe operating out of a building that was built in the 60's. Its open 24/7 and has a drive thru. It's definitely not like the stuff from Philly but it's still pretty good and ultra messy which is how it should be.",

There's good enough seating, and there's a cool bench to the side that you can sit on.  The customer service was amazing as well. I'd give them 10 stars for service if I could.

My cheesesteak was just okay and I wasn't really blown away by it. The meat tasted fresh and had a good amount of grilled veggies, but I think what upset me the most was the top and bottom of the bread was soggy. It was like eating a sloppy mess. The cheese fries weren't anything spectacular either. Pop's is really one of those places you don't get a desire to eat unless you feel like pigging out or need to eliminate a crave.",

We ordered various cheesesteaks , fries and drinks. When I saw the cook put the frozen meat on the grill I knew the taste would be compromised, but I was hungry and we were already there.  Once we got our food, I will admit the sandwiches were hot but the rest left a lot to be desired. The mushrooms were from the can , the meat was not brown but at all, the grease needed to be changed for the fries as they were dark brown, the onion rings were ok . I was very disappointed because I had heard great things about this place. Wouldn't come back. I will stick with Straight out of Philly over this place. Sorry no photos",

Cheesesteak was pretty good!  Whiz with onion is the only way to order and I believe it was served on an Amoroso's roll too!  Good proportion of chopped steak to whiz and the onions were sized perfectly to the gooey mix.  My only mild complaint is that there was an odd seasoning on the steak... soy sauce, magi or something that threw off the steak a bit... not sure what it was... not bad, but it was unexpected.  Such a simple sandwich that's difficult to get right...  In Vegas, Pop's probably does it best.",

    "text": "Solid 3 1/2 stars!  I suppose Pop's is a bit of an institution here in LV, probably one of the oldest places here where you can get a Philly cheese steak.  Hard to believe that I work less than 5 minutes away from here!  I can now come here whenever I want for some steak!  I probably would have given a 4 star if I had just stuck with their mantra...any of their famous steak sandwiches.  Possibly some fries.  We kinda did a detour by ordering things you wouldn't ordinarily get at a Philly cheese steak place so that took it down a notch.  Came here on a late night (probably the best times for one of these) and wouldn't you know, Pop's was hoppin'.  Parking lot was full!  We had no problem waiting in line though, goes pretty quick.  Wifey and I ordered:  *#4 - Provolone Cheese Steak ($9.99) *#35 - Pork Bar-B-Que ($9.99) *Fried Okra ($3.95)  But of course, best thing we had was the Provolone Cheese Steak!  Roll was light but still fresh tasting, there was a lot of meat & cheese in this sucker!  Oiliness galore!  Just like it probably should be.  Fat = FLAVOR!  Meat was seasoned well and was the focus of the sandwich.  Basically meat, cheese, bread.  Pretty damn delicious cheese steak.  Took away a star though for the rest of our order.  The Pork Bar-B-Que sandwich they said is an award winner but I just didn't like it that much.  The pork was overly stringy, but the sauce?  It was wayyyyy too sweet!  Like almost sickly sweet!  I was looking for more tang or bite to the sauce.  But the sweet was just too overpowering.  Really not on my want list.  The fried okra was OK, it was just really fried okra.  A little bland but fried fresh, could have used a bit more seasoning.  Plus it didn't really go well with our sandwiches so it was kind of forgettable.  Prices are fairly reasonable, but man paying nearly $10 for a sandwich gets to me for some reason - I guess it's because we have so much cheap food in town.  I mean come on, I can go downtown to get a prime rib dinner with sides, salad bar & dessert for the same price!  But thankfully Pop's cheese steak is tasty.  I'll be a regular at Pop's especially during my lunch days at work.  But I'll just go for a steak sandwich from now on!  #sweetmeat",

Perhaps deserves a 3 star rating.  Keep in mind it was at 1am! Open 24 hours! They had me at hot pretzel, I add mustard. Yes, mustard that's how it's done in PA.  Try it, but beware...you will be addicted.  Now, it's a walk up with handful of outside tables  and nothing special.  Trust me in that, please scroll through my pictures and read those signs :) Sweet potato fries, tasty.  Fried green beans, always hits the spot. Now, I was with a friend and we shared. Except the hot pretzel.  Let me be frank and honest, that hot pretzel was my dessert.  My cheesesteak consisted of provolone and mushrooms. I even always order that on a burger. Another time I was previously here I had capacola, salami and cheese.  The capacola was a bit tough and I was slightly disappointed. I Never ordered that again.  Guess what made up for it- the hot pretzel ha;) The Italian ices here are good.  Again though, what's my usual dessert... spot  But, if a hot pretzel is not your dessert choice.  Please order the cheesecake, can't beat it.  It's sweet potato maple and it may sound different.  Yes, it is different in an amazing way!",

I can't really begin to describe the poor tasting cheesesteak I had. I'm pretty sure the actual steak was steakumms or some other byproduct beef, there was som weird pink compressed square of \"meat\" on the grill. Couldn't finish it and tossed it in the garbage. Pretty disappointed",

But he hooked me up on the #36. It was delicious, but was. It worth $12.00??? UM, NO!  Adding bacon costs $2.00. Ridiculous.  This place also advertises bananas foster. I was expecting some deep fried banana caramel goodness but...it tasted like deep fried cheesecake bites...in fact I know it was. Somebody has to fix that, either fix the menu or fix the product ordering.  It's open 24 hours but I assume if you go here at 3 AM you are drunk...and this is pretty pricey for \"drunk food\".  My life partner and I shelled out almost $32.00 for two hoagies, two drinks, fries and fried cheesecake AKA BANANA FOSTER bites.  We agreed if the hoagies were $7.99 instead of $9.99 (not including extras) the pricing would be spot on.",

It was a nice evening and plenty of people were eating outside at the tables on their patio. There were about 5 people in line too but it moves pretty quick. I ordered a Whiz w/ onions and extra cheese. The sandwich with free whiz fries was almost ten bucks, not bad. My sandwich was  good but some of the meat was cooked a tad too long. The whiz fries were good as always.   There is no place to eat inside here... Just a walk up window and the tables and chairs on the patio and no drive thru. I kind of like it like that.

While I do like fast service, getting served already cooked meat, onions, and mushrooms swimming in meat juice and reheated on the grill isn't what I was hoping for. Three distinct flavors that should all be tasted in a good philly, and everything tasted like the meat juice. I asked for American cheese and I think I was given provolone, on account that it was especially stringy for whatever reason. There was so much bread in comparison to the meat, onion, and mushrooms that was in the sandwich.   The frier was broke or being cleaned, so I couldn't get any fries or other side items to go with my sandwich.  I always hear positive praise for this place, but for all the years I have occasionally bought food here, I have yet to have a good meal here that would make me understand the hype.",

I also thank them for respecting that my husband & I are veterans by always giving me the Military discount.  The people leaving bad reviews are obviously not cheese steak connoisseurs.  You can't beat the price for all the meat you get and it's always hot, fresh and delicious.",

The cheesteak was pretty good. but I don't have much to compare it to being that I am an LA native, and I have never been to Philly :(   My bf did have to add a little salt to the steak meat, he said it needed more seasoning *shrugs*  Would I return to Pops when I visit Vegas again? Yes, I would. I want to try the green bean fries.",

    "text": "Well, this is an iconic Las Vegas eatery and as someone who appreciates anything left of Old Vegas I think it's important to preserve and advertise whoever is left.  Unfortunately, the last 2 times I've eaten here the food has been complete slop.  Granted, both times have been late night excursions, but being a 24 hour business that shouldn't make a difference.   Few weeks  back I grabbed an Italian sausage sandwich with peppers and it was an abomination.  The entire sandwich was drenched in something resembling marinara sauce but it had very little flavor and was so messy you couldn't even really call it a sandwich anymore.  Tonight, I got a philly (their claim to fame) and once again it was just complete slop.  The bread doesn't taste toasted, the meat has very little flavor, very few peppers and slimy canned mushrooms.  Worse, they just dump a ton of Cheez Whiz on it and expect that to make up for the utter lack of taste.  Pretty sure this will be my last time, but I will give them props for variety and business hours.  I hope they bring back some quality soon, because this stuff is like food you cobble together yourself out of the fridge when you come home from a night out drinking.",

    "text": "Not a real Philly Cheesesteak! Went there with high expectations because any place that claims to have Philly Cheesesteak better know how to make a Philly Cheesesteak.  Not here.  Being a native Pennsylvanian and growing up on REAL Philly Cheesesteaks, this was a big disappointment.  Meat was not cooked to order on the grill, instead, probably cooked the night before( or worse) , put in a big pot and then simply re-heated on the grill when orders placed.  This process allows meat to sit in its own juice making the bread extra soggy.  So soggy that you can't pick up the sandwich with your hands.  He gives you a fork to eat it.  WHAT??  The meat had absolutely no flavor, very bland and chewy.  There is a reason that people stand in line in Philly to get a real sandwich and they don't mind the long wait because they know it will be the real deal.  Pulling meat out of a pot is not acceptable to call yourself a Philly Cheesesteak.  For all those leaving good reviews, well, I guess if you haven't had a real one, you just don't know any better.",

And somehow each one is just as amazing (though the chili cheese one is my personal favorite).  Their menu is to the point, but they have a lot of options within the cheesesteak and fry families.  Even their chips are good.  I see that they have Italian Ices as well, but I'm not even bothering with that until the weather warms up.  I've driven by this place so many times.  For YEARS now.  How could I not have explored this amazing place before?  I LOVE cheesesteaks!  It boggles my mind, is what it does!    But I'll put it this way: Now that I have found this place, I will make up for lost time.  I've already hit this place up several times in the last month.  Heck, I even hit it up on Christmas Day night after being over the whole turkey and ham thing.  24/7, they never close.  I could get a cheesesteak at 3:17 A.M. if I wanted to, and there's no force of man that could stop me.  Truly a marvel of modern invention, this place.  .....  And if you haven't gathered, I've quickly grown to love Pop's in the last month.  Wow.  Cheesesteak.",

Well, let me tell you! He wasn't being totally honest with me. Pop's is even better than our old haunt in PA!  I had the Cheese steak with onions, peppers, provalone and marinara.  What a treat!  There was so much stuffed into this sandwich, I couldn't eat it all in one sitting!  The flavor was amazing. The grill master was on point.  He must have had 10 different sandwiches going on and never messed up one order!  Kudo's to you, Grill Meister!  They were all very friendly and never rushed us or got irritated when I decided to change what was on my Cheese steak (sorry guys).  I try to get by there at least once a month to have a different sandwich everytime I go (they've got so many). Oh, and did I tell you about the sides? What a selection!  Any way, you have got to check them out!  And don't forget to sign up for there special coupons to be sent to your email.

The mushrooms are gross - straight from the can. I used to love this place, and would make my way to get there. Totally disappointed. Don't waste your time. One star because they're fast - go figure.",

If you are ever in town, you definitely have to stop by. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's outdoors so it's kind of inconvenient on a windy day and the sides are good, but not amazing. Despite those things, I'll be back to try other sandwiches anyways!!!",
