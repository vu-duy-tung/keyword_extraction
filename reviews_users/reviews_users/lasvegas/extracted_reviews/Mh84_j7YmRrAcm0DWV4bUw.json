    "text": "First time visit based on Yelp review.  Absolutely awesome!!!  This is a small family owned Italian deli/restaurant with incredible food. We ordered the Cugino's Special Pizza.  Thin, crispy crust with very flavorful tomato sauce, nice chunks of sausage, onions and mushrooms (we omitted the green peppers).  My husband must have said \"this is really good pizza\" at least 5 times while eating.  Well, it WAS xcellent!  To top off dinner, we finished with Chocolate Italian Ice.  Yum!  The owner came by to see how we liked the pizza ... he was very friendly and chatted a few minutes.  Very warm and friendly environment.  If we lived in Vegas, Cugino's would be our #1 choice!",

There was plenty of prosciutti on it, but it was the saltiest prosciutto I'd ever had. The bread and balsamic dressing wasn't anything special, and the mozzarella lacked the creamy flavor I love about good mozzarella.  That not so good sandwich was $9.00, and to top it off customer service was lacking.   Try this deli if you want, but definitely don't drag all of your coworkers here off of hwy 15 based on these other yelp reviews.",

    "text": "Man, I feel badly about giving this place three stars. I mean, look at the other reviews! People seem to really like this place! So why do I, someone who loves pasta, just give it a three? Well, here we go...  When I first walked into this place, I thought \"Oh, man, this place looks legit!\" They sell tons of Italian products here, different kinds of meat, and has a ton of Italian-like memorabilia on the walls... kinda like what Applebee's would look like if it were decorated by Rocky Balboa. But, I didn't come here to look at this stuff. I came here to eat. Everything else is incidental.  I ordered the most basic thing on their menu that still qualifies as Italian: spaghetti with sausage. I should note that the servings come with bread and a salad, though neither are something to shout about: the lettuce wasn't 100% crisp, the ranch dressing wasn't really cold, and they were served on the kind of plastic plates I buy my baby cousin. Already I was getting less and less enthused.   About ten minutes after they brought out the salad came the pasta. Man, it smelled good! Its the kind of the smell that you have to kind of appreciate for a second before digging in! Unfortunately, the scent of the food was better than the food. The noodles were somewhat overcooked, it seemed, and were thinner than I like (though I do not take off points for that, as that's a personal preference of mine). The sauce was good, kinda... good like upscale pasta sauce I buy at Vons, but not good like an Italian person who knows their business made it. The sausage was good, though not spicy like I was expecting (and asked for).   On the plus side, the portions were fairly generous and prices were not too steep. The guy at the counter was nicer to us after a few minutes, though he was never really mean... more like he was tired because it was late.   All in all, I'll probably come here. A lot of the reviews here are really positive, and maybe my experience is an isolated one. But if I come back here again and this place is still a three, it'll be on my list of places to come when you're hungry and aren't feeling too picky.",

While there I got real Parm Reggiano, mortadella, Genoa salami, and bread. I also got an Italian hero #2, at first I was disappointed in the size, about 8\", and I thought this wouldn't be enough. I was wrong! This hero was loaded with meat, cheese, lettuce tomato and the perfect amount of oil vinegar and oregano. Although somewhat of a drive I WILL RETURN!!",

    "text": "I cannot believe it has taken me this long to review this place when I ate there like three weeks ago!   I will admit, I am giving it four stars currently only because I need to go some more to really be sure that it is as good as it gets. I am an Italian lover and from an Italian family (by marriage) and I would like to try more of their foods before I give it a five.   This was the first time I have ever been, which is kind of dumb, considering I have been going to school and working at UNLV for the last four years, and only recently discovered an Italian place near by. How silly of me.   I like the way the place was set up. It had neat pictures and memorabilia stuff that made it feel really chill. It also had like a small grocery store like space where you could buy like 20 different types of noodles and other yummy Italian stuff to cook with. They also had this deli like set-up, displaying the enormous amount of meats they sell by themselves, or make a sub with! Pepperoni, Genoa salami, sausage of many flavors, just an abundance of eye-popping varieties.   So, now to what I ordered for my first meal at Cugino's. I had the Penne a la Vodka dish. OH MY GOODNESS! Amazing! I love vodka sauce and other then this pizza a la vodka I had in Portland from a food cart, I have not had good a la vodka pasta anywhere. Here though, it was delicious. The sauce was think, but not too thick, and thankfully it was not too creamy either. It was perfect to me. *Doing that kiss the fingers motion (hard to explain in words).   With the meal you get two bread sticks and a salad and it equaled $15. Which is pricey in a way, but that pasta was so good I did not care.   Now I am not sure if all their food is like that, but my first experience was fantastic and I hope to get back there soon!!!",

I'll just chalk it up to the fact that I like my Italian food spicy and/or with a strong basil flavor.  Maybe I just tried the wrong things.  I won't complain about the Olive Garden generation.",

Rice balls (meat and cheese)- yummy!! And the marinara sauce- OMG! Owner said they cool the sauce for 4 hrs.  Jamaican patty- it was good but overshadowed by the rest of the meal.  Frutti di mare- a-mazing! Lots of seafood! Yummy sauce!  What the place lacks in ambiance and presentation, the make up for the taste and quality of their food. And in the end, that's all that matters!",

The pizza is pretty spot on every time. I have had better in Vegas, but its right up there in my top 5 or so. They also make great salads and sandwiches. The staff is always friendly to us when we go in. If you go in, ask Donnie if you can try a piece of their fresh homemade mozzarella. Its the best Mozzarella i have honestly ever had.",

Not only was the Italian dishes authentic and scrumptious but the owner and all his sons were super friendly and warm and made us feel like family!!we came to Las Vegas because we were thrown out of Florida early, although we had planned a National Parks trip already to fly to Vegas..hurricane IRMA forced us out early. we found the place by accident and I cook Italian food from scratch at home and every dish we ate there was done perfectly. \"altente\"  just like we like on the pasta and they had Broccoli  Rabe and did it just perfectly WHAT A FIND!!!! We ended up eating there three times prior to our journey to the parks and came back and ended our trip going back to say goodbye as the guys hugged us. You walk up and order your food and then when you sit down, they bring it to you with a warm smile or chat. The bread was fantastic and they also have stuffed rigatoni!!! their sauce is delicious and pizza was out of this world!!! What a warm Italian kitchen feel...... thanks \"Dom\" and bros and family!!!

    "text": "Amazing New York Italian food by actual NY Italians- their food is delicious and they are friendly, despite the gruff reputation New Yorkers usually get. You can't go wrong with the sandwiches, but always check out their specials.  SANDWICHES: Once had a sausage and broccoli rabe special here that blew every other sandwich I've ever had out of the way. It was that good. The #1 and #2 are both solid if you dig cold sandos, the Tony Soprano or Goodfellas are tasty hot options. Regardless which one you pick, they're all served on some of the best bread outside of Italy.  PIZZA, PASTA, & OTHER OPTIONS: Haven't tried a whole pie, but their Sicilian square slices are crispy, cheesy, and delicious. The rice balls are a good, cheap add-on to your meal. Neapolitan is not stuffed, but still delicious. It's basically risotto with a crispy exterior and a side of sauce for dipping. AKA, heaven.  I've mostly focused on sandwiches here, and you can't really go wrong with what you pick from that section. Go in with an appetite!",

They have a makeshift market selling pasta, sauces and other staples on racks off to the left. On the right they have a deli/restaurant counter where you can order traditional Italian eats.  The folks here weren't the nicest....they just took orders, and didn't care to much to smile or make conversation. They were also in a bit of a fight with one of the tables - I made out that they were family and were arguing about something in the kitchen.....pretty unprofessional. But, on to the food.  I got the Italian sandwich. It comes with salami, mortadella and provolone cheese with a zesty dressing, some tomatoes and lettuce. Super fresh - and a pretty big portion. The wife got 2 slices of Sicilian pizza (along with a soda for just $6 - it was the special of the day!) Haven't had Sicilian pizza in a super long time and this was great. Thick, cheesy and the sauce was delicious. Great deal.  Overall it's a no thrills place to grab a bite. We came here straight from the airport, super hungry and left satisfied.",

    "text": "Cugino's Deli and Pizza delivers the deliciousness of New York pizza and eggplant parmesan subs to Maryland. That is  Maryland Parkway in Las Vegas, Nevada.      Born and raised in the New York metropolitan area, I grew up with sicilian pizza and eggplant parmesan subs that we call heros in New York. Thanks to businesses such as Cugino's Deli and Pizza, I get to relive the remarkable taste of New York pizza and eggplant parmesan subs.      Cugino's is located in the Runnin Rebel Shopping Center directly across the street from the UNLV Student Union. College students are amongst the many people that patronize this New York transplanted deli pizza restaurant.     The one thing that UNLV cannot teach is a zest for trying new places. This Yelp's job. When I was searching to find a new pizza place, Yelp led me to Cugino's. Subsequently I dined there two times in the last couple of weeks. On the first visit, I enjoyed their $5.99 two slice sicilian pizza special with a fountain beverage then on the second visit I savored an egg plant parmesan hero on toasted bread.      When I stepped into Cugino's, the inside put me in a New York State of Mind. If you have seen Greenberg's Deli in NY-NY, it trails behind this deli. When I looked straight, my eyes took in a display case that included deli staples such as Boar's Head. When I looked to the right my eyes saw the counter, deli groceries, and an additional dining room. When I looked to the left my eyes took in a TV, New York memorbelia including the NY Met's logo, and a refrigerator featuring Dr. Brown's soda. When I looked down, I saw my food on the table. I will discuss the in the following two paragraphs.       When I bit into the sicilian pizza, it was a historical personal Las Vegas dining moment. From the time that I moved here in September 2004 and the preceding Las Vegas vacations, never do I recall eating sicilian pizza. Sicilian is a square pizza that is usually thick. Anyway, since this is the leading sicilian pizza that I recall eating in Las Vegas it truly is the best that I had in this city. Comparing it to New York sicilian pizza is a different ball game. If I compared it to New York sicilian pizza, it is good. After leaving Cugino's and walking toward Coffee Bean, I was determined to return to here try their eggplant parmesan sub.      My determination paid off when I tried their eggplant parmesan sub on toasted bread. The eggplant parmesan sub on toasted bread was out of this world delicious. The $9 and change that I exchanged for the sub was money well-spent. With the fountain drink (only one refill allowed), it came to around $13. In similar style to my previous visit, I paid at the counter, the man filled my soda cup, I waited at the table taking in the New York deli scene, then a few minutes in the future he brought the food to my table. In my opinion, Cugino's did a better job with the eggplant parmesan sub than the sicilian pizza. The eggplant parmesan sub gives New York pizzerias a run for their money. Writing this makes me hungry as I think about the thick juicy eggplant enveloped with mouth watering mozzarella cheese topped off with red sauce between warm toasted bread. Kudos to Cugino's for capturing the taste of a New York eggplant parmesan sub.      I really appreciate that in recent years the taste of New York eggplant parmesan subs and pizza is following me to Las Vegas as more pizzerias and Italian restaurants open and Yelp opens my mind to the established restaurants. The upshot is that I appreciate Cugino's Deli and Pizza.",

The price was okay, and the customer service lacked just a bit. You can tell this is a family run restaurant and that they don't mess around about their food. Overall, I will definitely come here again and try other items. The inside reminds me of a Bodega in NYC where you can find good Italian made pizza. There are shelves with Italian products and treats and some tables and chairs inside if you'd like to eat there.",

I cant enjoy. Lunch or dinner. When people are rude .      Example. ,  my friend she asked for vinger and they wanted to know why.     And gave a big speech how it doesnt go. Except on a  salad.       Does it really matter?  Who cares?. She asked for vinger.   And then there was cheese. Why did i ask for that chesse on my sandwich? .    Who cares!!? its my preference. .  Everytime we went in there we were questioned why, this?  why that?  Who can enjoy. A meal. When You feel like you being interrogated.  And this wasnt. During ordering,   this was. During  when we were in the middle of eating!!!!!!!!,  when one of them came up and questioned us about what we had ordered it happened just not once not twice but numerous times,   we've had it!!!! we found a much better place,  , more authentic.   And the other place doesn't have a market to where they have to make money on products they focus on one thing and one thing only food Italian New York food they don't have to sell products to get ahead the stuff that they sell in their Market I can buy on Amazon or in any Market.  Im orginally from New York. The Bronx.   So i know. Food.    We're  not  going to miss anything   at Cugino's   Arrivederci",

Lol I swear it was like listening to one of my aunt's going off about how I should know better. I found it uncalled for but amusing at the same time. I guess it's an Italian thing. 5 minutes later my pizza and rice balls arrived. The pizza soooo good tastes home made. The Rice Balls were ok. My aunt's are better.

I didn't even mind waiting 20 minutes for a pre-made peice of pizza and steak sandwich...  That much... :-)  All that being said, the pizza was not that good.  In fact it was mediocre at best.  I would prefer something from the mall.  It wasn't Dominos bad, but it wasn't Gino's in Chicago good by any means.  The dough was really tasteless and the rest wasn't that good either.  The sandwich was ok, but I would expect more.",

Las Vegas should be lucky to have this local place because it's still the best overall Italian eatery in the city.   Everything they do here is quality that's consistent every time. Their fries, cannolis, meatballs, rice balls, mozz cheese, garlic knots, and cheesecake are all standouts. Their sauces are excellent and are made in-house.  They have good standard Italian fare such as pizza and pasta, but it's the sandwiches that are their star items, both hot and cold ones. I was even floored by the quality of the non-Italian sandwiches such as the Reuben and the Philly cheese steak. Try them all!  Cugino's is run by a hardworking family who just get it done. After all my years of going, they're still going strong in doing what they do best. The food is still as great and of the same quality as it was a decade ago and I still eat here to this day, which I can't say for most places here!",

The sauce is spectacular, and finally the cheese, oh the cheese, it was fresh and flavorful. I savored each bite and limited myself-two slices, I didn't want a belly ache but it was so hard I yearned for another slice. We also ordered the fried ravioli and cannoli, once again the cheese, oh the cheese was so flavorful. The cannoli was creamy and devilishly good. Great find for my neighborhood gym cause I'll need a double membership in order to work off all the calories that I will be consuming now that I have found the most AMAZING pizza.",

The philly cheese steak was tasty and full of steak. Pastrami was real Jewish deli style pastrami. All delicious. And the cannoli was yummy too.

As a NY Italian I have been trying to find authentic Italian food (I'm not talking Olive Garden people, I mean REAL Italian food) ever since I moved to Vegas almost 12 years ago and I found it at Cugino's.  I have never had anything off the menu that I didn't like but my two favorites are their Pene A la Vodka and the Goodfella (roasted veggies with roasted red peppers, homemade mozz on a toasted roll with a little olive oil and balsamic) sandwich.  Oh and their pizza is the bomb too!  Everything they make is homemade... the sauce, the cheese (ricotta and mozz), the meatballs, the soup, the sausage, the.. well you get the picture and it makes such a difference in the taste of the food.  The prices are great and the people are friendly.  If you decide to go for lunch during the week when UNLV is in session, get there early because its not uncommon to see a line to the door.",

    "text": "EVERYTHING at Cuginos is good.  From the pizza (they ship in the water from NY to make the dough), to the sausage (try the chicken and provolone), to all of the sandwiches (the best, juiciest pastrami I've had in Vegas).  Everything is good.  Probably because they make everything themselves in house and cooking great Italian food runs in their family.  I am so happy that I discovered this place.  It has that cozy neighborhood NY style deli feel that is hard to find in Vegas.  Besides all of the Italian lunch and dinner items, they also have some of the best quality cured meats, cheeses, and other deli items that you would expect from a True Italian deli.  I live down the street from this place and I go there several times a week.  I have been lucky enough to get to know the family that owns the place.  They are all very nice and are so good at what they do.  When you eat at Cuginos you can tell that they know what they are doing.  And if you go in and you're not sure what to order, I have two words for you: Donnie Special.  It is chicken cutlets with roasted peppers, fresh home made mozzarella, and oil and vinegar served on a toasted roll.  I like to get it with a little extra oil and vinegar on the side for dipping.  It is one of the best creations I have ever had in my life.",

Many of you may be wondering why Italian's love Mozzarella so much, it's so average at most places you get it.  But once you have real Mozzarella, you immediately understand.  Cugino's makes it fresh everyday, many times several times a day.  It is creamy, salty, and has the perfect texture for mozzarella.  You can slice this stuff and eat it raw, and you will finish it within a couple minutes.  If you've never tried it, go get it now!",

My wife and I stopped in about a month ago was was VERY pleased with the pizza they served. We just stopped in again today and was equally pleased. I have lived here for 8 years and this is serioulsy one of the best pizzas I have found in the valley. If I remember correctly they make their own sausage. The crust is fantastic, hand made, a nice crispness, even the smell alone screams quality. We have also had the bread knots and the toasted/fried ravioli. I havent seen toasted ravioli on a menu since I have moved here. Everything has been delicious.  We are looking forward to exploring other aspects of the menu, including some things we are not familiar with, but must be more popular on the east coast, including rice balls, and Jamaican beef patties. They also sell various sauces, olives, homemade sausage n' cookies, and other Italian goodies for the kitchen. Pizzalicious!",

The guys who run the place were great, and NY natives in visiting and chatting about the old neighborhood give this pizza joint a ton of charm.  My pizza was delicious, cooked to perfection, but was lacking a little in the flavor department (sorta bland - my own fault for not getting a classic cheese) and the crust was crisp and just the right thickness, but the dough was a bit tough (likely from Vegas' highly treated water).

Says the sausage was made in house?? It was link style, I prefer crumble, good but not great. My son got the regular slice of cheese, pretty large slices. The try highlight was the Rice Ball - deep fried full of mozzarella with an incredible side of marinara. It was a delight. Finished with the cannoli- it was ok.  Definitely give this place a try. Get off the strip and get some real reasonably priced Italian.  Also the sandos all looked fantastic. Next time !",

The guy at the register insured to me that the pizza was fresh even though I can completely tell it was at least sitting there for 10 mins. which is fine for some people but not me I was even willing to wait. But I went ahead and got the pizza they had already made I ordered pepperoni they had cheese out and just added the pepperonis on top and put it back in the oven for a few mins. The pizza was just OKAY! I'm sure if it was actually fresh out the oven like I wanted it would have been better I'll try it again next time HOT! Fair price compared to competitors.",

    "text": "Oh man! After meeting my French tutor at UNLV I was feeling hungry. As I was walking to my car I looked up and saw pizza. Who doesn't love pizza?! I wandered into this little hole in the wall with French on my mind, and almost left speaking Italian! The food was so authentic, delicious, and reasonably priced! Instead of trying the regular slice of pizza, I opted for a pepperoni calzone. When in Rome! ;)  OMG! SOOO GOOOOD! The bread was the perfect mixture of soft and crunchy. It was loaded with cheeses and pepperoni with a side of warm marinara sauce for dipping. It was a hearty meal leaving enough to take home for later.  They have so many dishes to choose from I may gain 50 lbs. trying them all, because I will definitely be back.  The atmosphere is friendly. The inside is slightly rundown (not dirty, but not new) but the employees are very friendly. It seems family owned.  Check it out. You won't regret it.",

This pizza was incredible. This place is definitely on the top of my list now and I will forever recommend it to all my family and friends. The garlic knots were beyond my expectations. Crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. Lastly, the fried raviolis were amazing! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!",

    "text": "I know I am going to get some yelper heat for this one, but I was not all that impressed with Cugino's. I thought about it and it's probably because I don't have some emotional connection to the place. The food was good, but it wasn't like I had a cool college memory attached to my slice of pizza. Sometimes food tastes better when you eat it during a special time in your life-- I get it. But for me, it was just pizza.   The food was good-- the quality is what really made this place stand out. Just walking through the door you can tell that this is a REAL Italian joint. The deli was stocked and they had a pretty extensive grocery section where you can buy all the Italian cookies and treats you've been looking for.   Lasagna-- It was very homemade and the ingredients were fresh. You could tell that this was not a lasagna that came out of the freezer. My portion was a little on the wimpy side that night. Kind of looked like it was the last slice in the pan and they had to scrape the sides to fill out its lopsided shape. The lasagna came with a garden salad, again nothing fancy.   Pep & sausage pizza-- Ordered a small aka a personal pan. It was very simple. The toppings were of good quality, but it wasn't all that impressive.  Chicken wings-- Great flavor, but not something that I would order again. The wings were small and not really a meal (even though it was a meal and it came with fries).   Would I come back? Yes. It was good enough to come back, but not a place that I could get excited about. I love to support local, small businesses so this place will always have my money over Pizza hut.   Plus, I am very curious about those rice balls and the cannolis.",

Came hot and was a square about 6\" x 6\".  Very crisp thick crust good amount of cheese and sauce.  I like thinner crust but it tasted very very good   The rice ball.  OMG.  Let's start with the sauce.  First of all it was like Momma made.  Rich fresh ingredients tasted like fresh tomato and basil little hint of sweetness.  I could have eaten spoonfuls alone.  The rice ball was tender and full of goodness.  It's a meal alone.  The ricotta was fresh and just enough.  Unbelievably good.  A must try!!!  The cannoli was cold (most of the time you get these delivered and they are warm).  It was crisp the center was creamy and there was just the right hint of cinnamon on the crust.  Amazing.    All in all it was delicious!!   I will be ordering again and again!!!",

    "text": "I have never written a Yelp review, but found it highly necessary to write one for Cugino's Italian Deli & Pizzeria. For starters, growing up in NY and living there about 25 years, I have been fortunate enough to experience a lot of good food in my life, not to mention some great Italian food. Well, I found Cugino's by chance, or in my case, maybe it was the luck of the Irish! So, Cugino's is tucked away in a strip mall across the street from UNLV, maybe a couple of miles from the strip. This truly is a hidden gem. It is the epitome of a family owned east coast Italian deli. In the three days that I was in Las Vegas, I had lunch there twice!  The owners/employees (all family) are extremely courteous and very friendly.  Checking on me during my meal to see how my food was. Everything is made fresh on site and is truly to die for. It's hard to make recommendations because I had the same sandwich, the Donnie Special (with my own little tweak going back to how I got the sandwich in NY), during my two visits. My GF had the large rice ball the first time, prepared by Donnie, parmigan style, and on our second visit, she had a side of meatballs and a side of their homemade sausage. Cugino's \"gravies\" (marinara or meat sauce) were both amazing. I  actually had Donnie freeze some of the marinara for me to pick up when i was going to leave Vegas and head back to SoCal. If you happen to be out and about or even out anywhere near Las Vegas, do yourself and your stomachs a favor and go enjoy this special family owned treasure. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Yelp, I'd like to applaud you for not letting me down. I bow to each of you, fellow Yelpers, for you steered me right tonight.  You see, tonight I got home from work and was just too exhausted to do much of anything. So, I settled on delivery and headed over to Yelp to guide the way.   I ended up ordering a Sicilian Rice Ball, the Donnie's Special Sandwich, and the Garlic Knots.   Delivery: I ordered using the site Eat24, which was easy enough. Because of their handy dandy little timer, I was able to see that my delivery took about an hour and ten minutes. I'm right up the road, so I'm not sure if they were just busy tonight or what. I didn't really mind the wait, since I'm just lounging at home--- but if you are rushed, keep that time window in mind.  Let's start with the knots: they're delicious. Flakey on the inside, crisp on the outside. VERY garlicky (which is a huge plus in this Italian girl's world). I feel like they might be slightly improved with a little cheese or something, but I'm not mad at all. My order came with six knots and a thing of marinara--- which was actually a nice sauce, for the record.   The rice ball is. . . well, I don't totally know what I was expecting, but it's big (like, half a softball?). Cooked well, slightly crisp on the outside, mushy in all the best ways on the inside, good flavor.  The meat and pea situation in the middle is really great. Goes really well with the marinara.   The sandwich is the stand out though. Like, the sandwich will be the reason I'll order from here again, no doubt. The bread is flakey, the chicken is huge and cooked well, the peppers are flavorful but not overly sweet, the balsamic is just the right flavor. . . and the mozzarella? Amazing.   Actually, I was saving the other half of the sandwich for lunch tomorrow, but now I think I'm going to grab that other half. Thanks again, Yelpers!",

The delivery charge was only $5 additional, very reasonable considering gas prices are so high, this is a steal!   The delivery lady was 3 min early and the food was very fresh still. Ordered the Godfather sandwich $10, side salad $4, Rice ball $2.50, Cannoli and the Cugino Sampler. The sandwich was huge - loaded with lots of meat, and very tasty. My favorite has to be the rice ball, can't fault a girl for loving balls! The Cugino sampler contains 2-3 of the mozzarella sticks, chicken wings, and fried zucchini. The salad was meh, just some veggies with pre-packaged salad dressing.   Probably will try their pizza next time.",

The Sicilian is the kind you find in New York/New Jersey and usually not too many other places, with a thick, crunchy crust and a particular flavor that nails the NY style.  And they have cannolis and other Italian treats, and the staff is friendly (they have the NY accents, but not the NY brusque manner).  There's no decor to speak of -- just New York stuff on the walls, unadorned Formica tables, a TV with a ball game on -- but the food's on target.",

They really made us feel welcomed!  We were craving pizza; but we're on a budget so this is where we ended up!  It's a deli/restaurant where you can also get your Italian supplies, like pastas not carried at traders or Vons.  What we got: 1. A 10 inch Vegetarian pizza $9.99: 9/10. Thin crust, crispy, with mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, olives, onions and bell peppers. I would hold the bell peppers cause they taste canned. Everything else. Very fresh.  2. Spaghetti and meatballs 10.99. 9/10. Comes with breadsticks and a salad. Plus 4 homemade meat balls. Will request for more sauce next time  3. Large canoli $3: creamy and crisp. Very good 7/10.   Will be back!",

    "text": "We visit Vegas maybe once a year, if that.  When we were there last June, we sought out this little place, off the strip, in kinda of a dirty little strip mall, across from UNLV.  Upon arrival, we were a little hesitant to go in but decided what the hell.  It was a small, casual place with Italian grocery items here and there, meats and cheeses hanging from the ceiling over the deli counters but you immediately get the feeling these folk know what they're doing.  The guy who took our order is the same guy who took it today.  He's the owner's son and understood our indecision.  We ordered a couple different items (antipasto, Stromboli, fresh homemade mozzarella, etc. are sold by the pound so you can get just enough to taste if you want to try several different items) and every last dish was fantastic.  Memorable even.  Their marinara is fresh and tomatoey and is served with most dishes as a dipping sauce.  Our guy checked on us several times to make sure we were enjoying everything.  We finished and had successfully overeaten but more so, we knew we'd be back. Today was the day.  We even skipped breakfast knowing this was our lunch destination.  We ordered enough antipasto to taste, a big enough sliver of the Stromboli to each try a little, garlic knots with marinara (holy omg ), a pepperoni and salami calzone to split and a small cannoli.  I'm pretty sure they add a little creamy ricotta with their homemade mozzarella to the calzone and what a unexpected treat.  But that marinara.  I swear it's half of why everything is so delicious.  We again successfully over-ate but don't regret it a bit.   The fact that this place is family owned, 1000% authentic & delicious and these guys are so friendly with those accents....it just wins every time.  We'll be back every trip!",

    "text": "Food: sandwiches are about $9 each and took about 15 minutes to come out.  We ordered the meatball parm sandwich and chicken parm sandwich which were very good quality sandwiches.   Meatball one was super moist and the bread had the right amount of crunch.  The sauce didn't make the bread soggy which was to my surprise.   The chicken was Katsu style which I did not find to go well inside a sandwich. The Katsu got pretty soggy after being inside the sandwich so I had to remove it as I was eating.   They do have some free samples on the cashier counter for small chips and what not.",

That's a different story.  Everything about their pizza is fresh - the crust was the perfect thickness and texture (crunch on the outside, soft in the middle,  just the right amount of (homemade) cheese, and perfectly cooked toppings.  I'm usually a one-slice kind of girl, but I couldn't stop eating this pizza.  Oh - and the garlic knots?  I bought three (two for the b/f, one for me)...and I ate two of them myself before I even got the pizza home.  GO HERE.  It will not disappoint!",

Yes, there are plenty of popular favorites that we all know: pizza, meatball subs, chicken parmigiana, etc., and there are also some traditional Italian foods you might not be familiar with.  I have an \"old world\" Italian heritage thanks to my mom. Every St. Joseph's day, she made arancini, and every Easter she made a pizzagiana. When I first found Cugino's I was floored! Arancini readily available! Mortadella in the deli case! Checkerboard cookies by the dozen! Frozen sfogliatelli to take home and bake!  If you've been looking for food like Nonna used to make, or you're feeling a little adventurous, or you just want some good pizza by the slice, head to the University district and give Cugino's a try.",

Meat lovers pizza came with slides meatballs, which were seasoned perfectly and a delight to pick off and scarf.  Eggplant parmigiana was delicious and authenticly beautiful.

I just moved here a few months ago, and had no established pizza joint, which i deserately need. Ordered a pep pie off Grubhub, and that may have been part of the problem, but definitely not all to blame. After patiently waiting over an hour, my pizza arrived. Upon opening it didn't look promising. The crust was rock hard and tiny, sauce barely there, and was something that you could find at your local snack bar in a skating rink. I logged on here and saw all the 5 stars, completely dumbfounded. If LV thinks this is the best pizza in town, I'm in trouble.",

After my son polished off his pizza I gave him a bite of my sandwich and he immediately offered to eat the rest of it for me...no way!  But I did feel guilty about not sharing so I let him have a few more bites (but that's all).  The service was fast and really friendly.

We shared an Arancini, some Garlic Knots, The Sicilian Pizza Special, and whats probably the tastiest Meatball Parm I've had in a very long while!  Looking forward to returning to try other Italian specialities....ALOHA!!!",

You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, to be honest. I usually get the Italian-2 cold sandwich, but I'm trying to cut meat out of my diet and I was pleasantly surprised that this joint has vegetarian options! The eggplant parmigiana sandwich was extremely delicious, as well as their rice balls and garlic knots. It's a very homey feel here; service is always spectacular and friendly. Always will be coming back!",

I have not found anything like this here on the west coast.  I'm an east coast girl at heart and this restaurant made me feel \"home\".  Nothing fancy about it...pretty straightforward.  Clean, fast, fresh, and inexpensive.  Can't ask for much more than that!",

The food was very authentic and there is such a good variety of Italian dishes to choose from so there's literally something for everyone.   The best thing about this place is the service from the owners and the family! They are so welcoming and knowledgable about their business heritage, their menu and offerings, and very accommodating to what you are asking for. Planning a wedding is hard enough, especially when trying to place a $2000 food order for guests. Cugino's staff was very patient and available for all of our needs, and even delivered everything to the venue with supplies to keep the food warm.   I love this place! Truly a gem here in Las Vegas! I only wish they had a location that was closer to my house!",

Serve warm. *Stromboli - thin dough rolled with various Italian meats and cheese. Sliced and served warm. *Eggplant Parmasen- Large portion of thinly sliced lighted breaded eggplant and mozzarella cheese covered in their amazing homemade sauce. Served with a salad and pasta. Bigger than a restaurant portion. *The Godfather Sandwich - Fried Eggplant, Mozzarella, Roasted Pepper and balsamic vinegar. *Donnie's Special Sandwich - Chicken Cutlets (thin), fresh mozzarella, roasted pepper, balsamic vinegar and oil. *HOMEMADE on premises mozzarella cheese. The best I have had in Las Vegas. Firm and lightly salted. EXCELLENT.",

The food is good and its cheap eats.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall, behind UNLV with a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and a Chipotle at the street front.  When you walk inside, the wall is decorated with photos of famous Italians, Italian food items are lined along the wall and shelves, and New York team logos are plastered throughout the store.  On this visit, we needed something quick before going to the KA show at the MGM.  Aside from hot and cold sandwiches, this place also serves pizza and pasta, and offers affordable daily specials which won't break the bank (and that's important in Las Vegas!).  We started off our dinner with their garlic cheese bread.  Its a simple starter with garlic and melted cheese on a thick Italian roll.  For our entrees Stephen and his dad ordered the spaghetti and meatball special, which came with 4 meatballs. Stephen's mom and I had the meatball Parmesan sandwich special. It was loaded with lots of cheese, and I could have easily shared one.  The portions are generous, and you won't leave hungry. Its a great place for a starving UNLV student. As I said, the place won't break the bank.  The total for all 4 of us came to $45 with tax, and we left in a food coma.",

I'm no pizza expert but I have never seen that done before, and it came out very dry and greasy. The saving grace is the authentic Italian deli atmosphere and thankfully the cannoli was right on par with with I expected out of an authentic Italian deli.

The restaurant is very cute and clean inside and the staff very attentive and friendly.",

    "text": "Again, another time I am asked to leave a review to a place I already reviewed, so here it goes: I went there on a recommendation from a friend, so my expectations were high. Although you won't find similar authentic quality food and choice of delis in Vegas (run by actual Italian owners), but I have to say, I was a little disappointed. Apart from the decent choices of Italian meats and salads, and the freshness of the food, the taste kinda left a bit to be desired. Bread is a major factor when it comes to delis and pizzerias, and I have to say it was not as much as I was expecting; maybe because my friend's recommendation made my expectations too high. I ordered both a slice of pizza and a sandwich, and I found both their bread and dough about average. Still pretty good, compared to most places, but there is definitely room for improvement when it comes to their bread, especially when you use the word \"Italian\" in the name of the business, and that comes with big responsibilities....",

When the pie arrived, I immediately needed to have a look at the crust because it is crucial to good pizza. The crust is similar to a Brooklyn, New York style. Nice and crispy on the bottom with the remainder pleasantly chewy. The sauce wasn't lathered too think, nor was it too sweet or too tangy. When you have the opportunity, do yourself a favor and give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed. Excellent pizza!",

It is a very popular place for many of the UNLV students and there is good reason. The storefront is like walking into little Italy, it is a very happy and an open atmosphere. Right from the start it smells like those old fashion deli's that use to be here in SF. I knew right there I was in heaven. The counter has many delicious salads and of course desserts like this delicious silky cheese cake which I ordered. They also have many delicious cookies and Italian food which gets shipped from New Jersey. The family who runs this business are very sweet and welcoming. They welcome you with a warm smile and it's like being on the East Coast when you hear their accent it is absolutely charming.  Now let's talk about the food, I finally had like a real calzone and I mean it was so delicious and bigggggggggggg. The sauce was so amazing and it was fresh so you don't get heartburn like you would from business that use canned products, this sauce was made fresh and from scratch.  I barely could finish it and Timmy had this Italian sub and my brother also had the same thing as him. The sandwich was a True Italian sub and again since it is all made fresh you don't experience any heartburn.   We also bought these delicious Italian cookies. So I encourage all who go to Vegas stop by this shop, the prices are cheap compared to what you would pay in the Bay or on the strip and again you have real Italians from the East making this food and a REAL CALZONE! Next time I am going to go for their famous pizza which they are known for all over Vegas as having the best pizza. I am not going to lie though I am going to have that cheese cake because I haven't had one that tasted that good since the Elk's club and again that was made by Masonaries :} from the EAST COAST. :}",

And I still haven't found it... I'll probably go back and try their pasta but so far I'm not impressed by this place.  First, the smell.  Any good italian deli and/or pizza place has a tasty smell when you walk in.  This place didn't have it and if I was blindfolded walking in I probably couldn't tell it from any other place. Not terrible, but nothing special.  Service was pretty mediocre.  There were at least 6 people behind the counter doing their own thing.  Looked like one of those 'kitchen nightmare' episodes.  I'm standing for the longest time waiting for the guy at the register to stop talking to the two ladies in front.  Then the guy gets my pizza and he asks this other guy 3 times what the total was, 3 times, $22.78 (a bit pricy).  What's my change?  1.22  Okay fine, some places charge extra for take out so whatever.  Granted the pizza was cold by the time I got home but still it wasn't that good.  The crust was soggy and the sauce tasted somewhat like pappa john's.  The sauce killed it for me.  I got the special and the sausage and pepperoni and cheese didn't seem very fresh and the dough was nothing special.  Not the worst pizza I've had but not that great.   I don't get the high reviews here.   I've had better pizza at costco.",

I guess that's the reason why it's always packed with students (their dorms are just on the other side of th road).

I must have talked to all the wrong people because four years of university and everyone I asked persuaded me not to step foot into this place. Now I know all of them were selfish bastards who are trying to keep this place all to themselves.   This Italian deli and restaurant is so diverse that even people with dietary restrictions would be able to dine with few problems. I met a friend after work for dinner. I wish I had taken some pictures, but I was ravenous by the time it all came out. The food appears at a slower pace at Cugino's. Do not write them off. It would be a major loss. We split everything to ensure a large variety. The Goodfella Sandwich is filled with grilled and marinated bell peppers, eggplants, and zucchini. These veggies absorb the aromatic balsamic vinegar well. Fresh mozzarella, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions also come on the crusty roll. I wish they had peppers spicier than a jalapeno or pepperoncini, but it was fantastic. The Garlic Knots and Linguini in Clam Sauce were great, but not as magnificent as the sandwich. We ended our meal with a cannoli. It was not blow your socks off, but anything would pale in comparison to the meal we just experienced.   Now I will go and spread the word of Cugino's like those before me should have. I will not selfishly cling to this shop. Instead, I want everyone to enjoy them as much as I did.",

I brought some of my east coast friends with me for lunch one day and they all agreed that they felt like they were back home :)",

    "text": "I'm tempted to give this place 5 full stars, but I'll reserve that review after a full sampling of the menu. So far, ridiculously good!  I've been there twice in the last same number of days. I had their Lasagna Bolognese yesterday, and their Spaghetti with Marinara sauce today. The Lasagna with their home-made ricotta was gigantic, piping-hot and straight out of the oven, and wonderfully seasoned for my taste (which is light on salt and right on spices). Their Spaghetti was on the money with slightly tart marinara that tasted fresh, and a portion size that could easily satisfy two patrons with a shared appetizer.   The place seems family owned, and you'll find a splattering of Italian regulars that chat it up with the lady at the counter. This place is good. Everything from their Italian dressing, to simple breadsticks, and pizza that my dining partners had -- I gotta try more pizza for sure -- all of it is just good.   The restaurant/deli has a wide selection of fresh deli meats and cheeses, home-made mozzarella and ricotta, and appealing-looking sandwiches that are very reasonably priced, and I suspect, will be delicious when I try. This place is 4.5 right now! Try it, like it, repeat.",

    "text": "Molto bene!  Prego!  With overflowing gratitude to my co-worker and Yelp Lt. General Supreme Goddess Jaime who HIGHLY  encouraged I forgo a boring Subway lunch for something a little more exciting.  With only 30 minutes for lunch, a person has to really ponder the worthiness of the extra 3-4 miles each way.  In her most nonchalant way, she mentioned she loved her meatball sub SO MUCH that when she inadvertently dropped a meatball on the floor it was almost good enough to pick up and eat.  My kind of foodie!  The General also recommended I call ahead but I opted to use their online ordering service via  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Feat24.com&s=f6a43a39d83313a99e0c9648cc2dfb057d7893980b27777fec0cb32d6333a670\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eat24.com</a>.  (Cugino's has their own website, but when you want to pre-order to are redirected to a Cugino/eat24.com website.)  The online ordering process was a breeze.  I am a web guy and I really appreciate that.  The ONLY reason I only rated Cugino's with 4-stars was it was my understanding when I provided my CC to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Feat24.com&s=f6a43a39d83313a99e0c9648cc2dfb057d7893980b27777fec0cb32d6333a670\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eat24.com</a> I had already pre-paid for my food.  So, when I arrived to pick up my food I was surprised when the nice lady asked for my CC.  I understand now why they do it that way....If I actually never pick up my food, I could request my CC company Noneify the charges.  Major props to Jaime as when I picked up my food at 12:05pm, there were at least 10-12 people in line.  So, I was able to smile and breeze right by.  The few times I get to feel superior in this world is when you order food correctly and leave the average joe's (hi Terri.....lol) in the dust.  Brought the food back to the office and I was not disappointed.  In fact, if I had dropped a meatball on the floor in our workplace kitchen, I WOULD HAVE PICKED IT UP and eaten it.  LOL  As you can tell my photo, the side salad was pretty huge.  A great lunch value for $11.  I would highly recommend this place, I would become Yelp friends with Jaime (cuz, she knows her stuff), and I would order ahead online.",

    "text": "Another bookmark bites the dust! I actually bookmarked this place a long time ago after seeing someone post a picture of a yummy looking pastrami sandwich, which I knew my husband would love trying. When we walked in and I saw they had pizza and other stuff on the menu I was excited to give this place a try. They had the typical \"pizza by the slice\" sitting out on the counter as well the same thing with the garlic knots. I don't mind when pizza is sitting there and gets re-heated, if it is good pizza it can handle it. What I don't like is when it has actually been sitting there for hours. With this place being located across the street from UNLV, I would figure if good pizza is put out here, it wouldn't last long with a college crowd around. I love trying garlic knots from different places, but just couldn't do it here since they looked greasy and like they had been sitting there for a long time. Bummer.  I just asked for a regular slice of cheese ($2.25 each) and a Sicilian slice ($2.50 each) to-go. The regular cheese slice was almost not edible. The slice had too much cheese on it weighing it down and when I picked up the slice it immediately flopped. No folding with that slice! It just lacked any \"wow\" flavor for me. The Sicilian slice however was perfect. The crust was crisp and chewy where it needed to be and I enjoyed every bite. I'm really glad I tried both because just trying the regular slice wouldn't have me wanting to come back. I don't usually see places that sell Sicilian by the slice so that is a bonus plus the fact that it tastes legit.   They have Boar's Head lunch meat for sale and a variety of sides. Inside appeared clean and there are tables or booths inside and tables outside. Catering is offered. Delivery is offered.",

I use to chain smoke Cloves at Cafe Copio when I was in my teens and consume large quantities of cheap beer listening to the Beastie Boys at Tom n Jerry's when I was barely 21. The days when I had less bills and belly fat. My Doc Martens and I ruled the world. Great memories were had here. This made picking up this pizza that much better. On to the pizza.  When I walked into Cugino's for the first time I was overwhelmed with all of the authentic cheeses, meats, breads, pastas. This was the moment I realized I am not just a foodie, but a gigantic food pervert. This is Food Pervert Heaven!!! Just walk in and you will know what I mean.  Fresh Tomato and Basil Pizza- Large for $16.99. Do not make any changes to it. Everything about this dime piece is bangin just the way she is. If you don't like garlic than this isn't the Za for you and we are not friends. I happen to LOVE garlic and this sexy pie is packed with it. Then they throw fresh, earthy basil and firm tommies to the mix and walla. The perfect pie. Don't even get me started on the crust. Let's just say every great painting starts with a fine canvas. I love this pizza.  It's simple and simply phenomenal and everyone I shared it with agreed.   When I was driving home with the pie I felt like I had the hottest date in my car. Seriously, the aroma gently traveling from that box to my nostrils made me high and I couldn't stop smiling from ear to ear.  I can't wait to do this dance again only next time I will be rockin out to Violent Femmes remembering the good ole days in my hometown.  Kudos to Yelp (Rex's review) for leading me to Cugino's. Nacho C. and his birds would have loved this food. Mad props to Cugino's for making an incredible pie. All the other pie shops can sleep with the fishes.",

I would love to try more here from what I saw there, and pictures on yelp, everything looks good.  Large pizzas are pricey. I paid 64 for 3 large, good thing work paid for it. We had 1 veggie, 1 Margarita and 1 special. All were really good, not quite a 5 star, but still good, among the best so far I've had living in vegas, most of my other pizza experiences here have been ranged from VERY disappointing to just so so.",

    "text": "Came here with my wife on a rainy afternoon. Been craving Italian food for a while, and the last place we tried that was similar was Rocco's. That establishment was outstanding so I was kind of using it as a benchmark.  Cugino's is located in a strip mall near UNLV. It was totally packed inside. Everyone was wedged in their like sardines. But it was lunch, so it was to be expected. The line moved quickly and the service was fast and friendly enough.  I first noticed the pizza they had sitting out looked old and pretty dry. A little disappointing to say the least, especially since pizza is what my wife originally wanted. We opted for the meatball parmigiana sub and a riceball.  The riceball was good, but nothing special. The meatball sub was pretty good. The meatballs were flavorful, and the marinara sauce was decent.  The bread was toasted and fresh. If there was any cheese it was very little. I guess this was the disappointment. The sandwich was tiny!!!. Not at all like i'm used to getting at an Italian Deli. Most deli's your so stuffed when your done, you roll out like a beach ball. No such luck here.  Overall I'd give this Deli 2.5 stars. Service is friendly. Food is good, but i've had way better, portions are small, and the dining area is small and crowded. Much better options in Vegas.",

Girlfriend got a bolognese and came out extremely oily asked to get something else without even touching the pasta and they refuse and finally exchange it was 2 slices of plain cheese pizza which wasn't spectacular either. $13 for $4 worth of pizza. Beware of this place, I don't understand the other review here, doesn't add up to me. I could go to subway and get a better meatball sub then this place or go to metro pizza down the block and get better tasting pizza!",

I  Ordered a dozen canollis and I was expecting to get them right from the case but little did I know they were going to make them fresh on the spot. I am extremely impressed I got them made to order. I will definitely be back tomorrow to order another item from there menu and every day after until I leave to go back to California. Cugino's is going to be on my number one list of places to visit every time I come back to visit Las Vegas. This was a great find I found on yelp thanks to all the pictures and comments. Thanks to all fellow yelpers! If you are looking for a old school Italian deli this is your best bet in Las Vegas!!",

But the food was good, my friend and I both ate for about $25. Overall, the food was good but maybe not the type of place I'd spend twenty bucks to eat.   The ambiance was nice, we were there late afternoon and it wasn't too busy. The inside of the place really gives you a traditional feel. The place does look a bit dated but I think that just adds to the old deli feel of the place.   Overall a good mom & pa restaurant. Support your locals!",

To make a long story short these guys wanted some of the best and authentic New York style deli and Italian food in Las Vegas.    So we figure lets go check this place out. I'm proud to say that after about 5 years this is still one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.  And that's not even with me getting to the food.  Julia and her family are the nicest, kindest,  sweetest people on this earth.  It doesn't matter if it's been a day, a week,  or a few months,  they take the time to chat with you.  Ask how the family has been and always have a smile on their faces. That awesome attitude translates into the food.  Fresh sauces made daily,  authentic New York style pizza,  garlic knots to die for,  and those rice balls.  When I first started going to Cugino's they weren't regularly available,  you had to ask or pre order them.  I always get the larger rice balls with the meat inside.  If you are eating in store ask them to heat it up and put some sauce and cheese on top. Everything from a basic plate of spaghetti to the linguini and clams is always top notch,  hot and amazingly fresh.",

Now, I will be coming to Las Vegas to eat at Cugino's Italian Deli ... and the rest of Las Vegas' attractions will have to wait.  Yes, it's that good.  If you're expecting a $$$$ experience you can take your butt to the strip. At Cugino's ... it's more like coming home and seeing the family.  It's comfortable and you feel like they've prepared the food how they'd serve it to their own family.  It's like sitting around the table at home.  The flavors here are authentic and the service is friendly.  You can tell by the number of locals that are clearly returning customers, that this place is doing everything right.  My wife and I ate here for dinner.  She's a big fan of thin crust cheese pizza and is very picky about it ... she ranks Cugino's among the best 5 she's ever had.  She says that the perfect cheese pizza must be perfectly balanced between crust, sauce and cheese and she found it delicious.  I couldn't make up my mind, so I had the #2 Italiano sandwich AND a Meatball Parm sandwich (granted, I only was able to eat half of each).  But, WOW!  I'm hooked.  The Papa Cugino came by to each table and gave each of us a sample of what seemed to be an egg, ham, and cheese bread cut like a biscotti.  I forgot to ask what this was, but it was delicious too!  In a town full of self-proclaimed \"best this\" and \"best that\" ... we found a place that doesn't have to toot it's own horn ... their customers keep coming back.  In my review book, that means a lot.  When I'm in town, Cugino's has my dedicated business for their excellent tasting food and the heart and soul they put into their business.",

The first thing I noticed was the sticker on the door advertising Boar's heads meats and when we walked in they were speaking Italian, double win! This place is part deli, part Italian grocery store, and part restaurant. Although, I did find the plastic meats and cheeses hanging over the deli counter a bit tacky.   I was initially going to try their pizza, but it looked like it had been sitting all day. So after a quick look at the menu, we settled on the pastrami melt and spaghetti and meatballs. The pastrami sandwich was gigantic! It was also pretty delicious, although I am not sure I could eat a whole one simply because it was so rich. The pastrami, melted cheese, and secret sauce made the sandwich fantastic. I am not a huge fan of rye bread, but I did end up stealing half of the sandwich from my husband. The spaghetti and meatballs were good, nothing spectacular, but good. The sauce definitely made the dish, it was simple but also had a depth of flavor. The meatballs were good, but nothing special. The spaghetti was OK, but could have been better. There was little bread stick on the side and let me tell you it was fabulous. It was crispy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside. So delicious and unexpected! Overall, I would like to try more of what they offer, but I think that sandwiches are definitely the way to go here.",

My boyfriend turned me on to it, supposedly his dad and him have a tradition of getting the Donnie's Special and the Italian and each getting one half of each. Let me tell you that's a perfect introduction to their sandwiches. The Italian is thick with meats and cheeses but it's cold and crisp and a great counterpart to the Donnie's Special which is chicken cutlet with roasted peppers, mozzarella, oil and vinegar. When it's hot it's amazing. When it's cold it's still great but try and get it hot. The shop itself is basically a deli/market with black and white checkered floors and some tables to eat at. It really feels like people come here just to hang out. You know the people that come here are regulars. I haven't had any of the pizza or desserts but they look fabulous. I'd recommend coming here if you need any fresh mozzarella or meats as well. Make sure you bring cash because you can't tip with cards!",

We also love their Calamari Salad whenever its available. Folks...please..highly highly recommended!",

Too bad they close at regular times by all standards outside of Vegas, because this would be a late night sensation. There is no better pizza around. Sorry strip...overpriced. Sorry Tony G...this family run operation has you beat. Sorry Metro...not even close. Thank you for living up to my dreams and expectations! This is my favorite restaurant in this city...I obsess about you at least once a week for months now. So good you may need a restraining order...I'd wash dishes for a slice. Keep it up family, you are the American dream",

I had the spaghetti with meatballs because... why not? Asked for the rice ball heated up with sauce and cheese, soooo good. The garlic knots were perfectly soft and seasoned. Also had a cannoli for dessert because you can't go to an Italian restaurant and not have a cannoli. Yes, I ordered a lot for one person- I'm aware! LOL but I wanted to try a little bit of everything and also had left overs for my daughter.   The staff was so friendly, kept checking on me, came and refilled my fountain drink for me. It was also kept very clean even though it seemed to be pretty busy. I'd definitely go back because there's a lot more to try on the menu!",

Thin crust, flavorful sauce, and hot melty cheese that doesn't slide off  Besides the heavenly pizza, they offer pasta, sandwiches, and a variety of meats and deli items as well. With shelves stocked high with Italian specialties, fresh dough being kneaded right behind the counter, and walls lined with knick knacks and memorabilia, this charming little deli provides a classic East Coast feel and is without a doubt worth stopping in for",

When my days on earth are done, I hope that some of my ashes can be sprinkled in the cappacola locker - so that hopefully my spiritual ethos will live on within this stoic establishment. I took my bride to Cugino's, she liked it too.",

We met Rob at the cashier stand and was instantly greeted with a warm welcome. The first sight of the fresh, steamy, cheesy pizza was already enough for us to eat our hearts out. The first bite though... Oh boy. My taste buds were exploding with flavor as my dopamine sensors synonymously fires at all cylinders. It's been awhile since I've smiled from ear to ear like this upon ingesting a pizza pie. The texture was phenomenal. The cheese was substantial enough to be the profound star of the dish but not too heavy where it stole thunder from the crust. I can't wait to finish this whole damn box. Great job fellas!",

I shop at their deli for items that I cannot find at the grocery store. The cannolis are great but nobody will ever make better Struffoli than my Dad. I did appreciate the fact that they had some ready made at Christmas time! All in all a great Italian experience.",

Received confirmation via email that the order was received. To be on the safe side I called the morning I was expecting delivery to ensure we were are all set. Glad I did bc not only did they NOT know anything about it, the guy who answered the phone (i think his name was Dominic?) was a complete dick about it. He gruffly told me it wasn't his problem I'd have to call the third party vendor. Real nice customer service (note sarcasm) I called Grubhub/EATS24 who said they did in fact send it over but the restaurant never responded. Why have this online order feature if you don't bother to look at it? Long story short, Grubhub/EATS24 ironed it out and the pizzas were delivered, a half hour late (which is a big deal when it's for staff who use a punch clock to record their hours) and two of the pizzas were wrong. And they weren't very good- not that any pizza in Vegas really is, but they were like cardboard crap. If Cugino's had apologized, or helped me in anyway, I would possibly give them another chance, but their nasty attitude, no way. they'll never get another penny from me.",

It is a great NYC style deli that I'm so happy I found. The must have items that I order every time are their stuffed peppers and their cannoli's. The peppers are stuffed with bread stuffing and soaked in italian dressing. They are both to die for and taste so good!   I usually get the chicken parm sub but this time I split the linguini with tomato basil sauce with my mom. It was a perfect portion for us to split since we both don't usually eat large portions. It was yummy but since I'm not a huge fan of cut up tomatoes I would have preferred a marinara sauce. I would recommend trying the chicken parm sub over the pasta. It's one of the best subs I've ever had.  At the deli they also serve other hot and cold subs, pasta, and deli items. You can also buy boxed pasta and other Italian food items. We tried their raviolis they sold in the past and they were really good!   They also sell italian rainbow cookies that they make and those are amazing! A little pricey though (12.99 a lb...) But worth it every once in a while for a splurge!   If you are a big Italian food fan you need to check out Cuginos. You will not be disappointed!",

I had Donnie's Special, a huge chicken cutlet on a perfect roll with peppers, onions, lettuce, balsamic vinegar, and mozzarella cheese.  The cheese was the real deal.  Thick mozzarella.  I did a lot of thinking, because I didn't want to be hyperbolic, but I am pretty sure this is the best sandwich I've eaten in Las Vegas, it's between the Donnie and catfish sloppy joe at RM Seafood at the very least.  The bun was crusty at Cugino's, but held everything together well.  And, this is a LARGE sandwich, side of chips not necessary.  The balsamic was an awesome addition to the sandwich.  Finally, very thinly sliced onions, always a good addition.  My wife had the Cugino's special, which is basically the same as the Donnie's, but with prosciutto.  It frankly had so much prosciutto on it, I wondered how they made a profit.  Another enormous sandwich.  I look forward to eating here again very soon to try everything.  But, I don't know how I can go here and not get Donnie's Special.",

Crispy crust and delicious toppings. And the cheese, the cheese just kept going and going. After dinner we had the tiramisu and the cannoli's. Again they nailed it. The tiramisu was made in house along with the cannoli 's. I haven't had these deserts in years since my grandparents passed and it brought back memories of what I have been missing.

I wanted to like Captiotti's, but their bread is no good.  Cugino's has that proper blend of crispy outside, chewy inside that makes it so great.  Service was quick and friendly; interior is nice and clean with ample seating.  There are also a few tables out front for days when it is not too hot or cold.  I will definitely return to try the pizza, but I can see how if you don't get a slice from a fresh pie, it might not be so great.  A full report will be forthcoming.  But in any case, if you want a great Italian hoagie, Cugion's is the place to get it.",

A friend picked up some meats and cheeses from this deli that I had never heard of but vowed to one day visit. Then Lisa L gets ROTD. I decided it was high time.  I went for lunch last Friday. Walking in there, I felt like I was in New York. The place is so Italian, right down to the incredibly friendly people working there. I decided to get a Meatball Parm and some slices of prosciutto. Man. That sandwich was off the hook! The prosciutto was also great, but I went cheap by getting the domestic ($13 a pound). Next time, I'll try the imported ($20 a pound). I was amazed at how full I was after the Meatball Parm and five slices of prosciutto. Maybe because the sandwich came with a 20oz soda.  I wish I knew about this place when I was going to UNLV. Or maybe they weren't there yet. In any case, Cugino's is definitely getting added to my lunch rotation.",

    "text": "Finally got to try this place out.  Garlic knots were just as everyone says.  Very good but the styrofoam plate they served it on had a microwave hole in it. I thought they say you shouldn't microwave styrofoam bc it releases unhealthy chemicals or something. Maybe I'll just get some to go and throw them in my toaster oven.  We also ordered the large rice ball (which has meat where as the little one don't)  with the upgraded Parmesan cheese and tomato sauce .  It was interesting but the taste was dominated the rice and tomato sauce. One thing peculiar was that portions of the rice ball was still cold.  The reason for the low stars is my gf and I got pretty stomachache and spent a better part of the day running to the bathroom. We're guessing it was the rice ball. Maybe they weren't thawed correctly or were a little old.  The place had a NY deli feel. I will go and try the NY pizza slice but after some time to forget today's stomachache.",

I decided  to try it and got an authentic new York feeling (never been to NY but I imagine they know a thing or two about a then tic new York food). So I decided to try the pastrami melt and fell in love with it and I would  only order that sandwich on several occasions, nothing  else. So a few nights back my wife was going to order pizza from a place I'm not fond of , I suggested she order from cuiginos  and she picked up a  ny deep dish.i had never tasted a sauce so original  it was amazing .I'm so used to pizza chains that I had not expected  the pizza to be that good but it was great. Last night we decided  to get a another pepperoni pizza and wings but not deep dish (pan tossed I think) it was even better .the people who work there and give a real authentic  family vibe and positive  service. I can't wait to try more things on their menu. Good job cuginos and I will continue  to recommended them to everyone  I can.",

    "text": "Yelp comes through again.  I was craving some pizza--east coast/NY style.  Thanks to Peter A.'s pictures/review of Cugino's, I decided to talk the fiancee into picking up a pie.  Half plain, half pepperoni.  In the three years of living in Vegas, this is pretty darn close to being an authentic NY style pizza.  The dough was thin, foldable, and slightly crispy.  The sauce was not overpowering, thin, but had enough flavor to compliment all of the other ingredients.  Gosh, I hate when I buy a pizza and it has clumps of tomato--I didn't order a salad!  The cheese...was perfect, ratio, flavor, etc.  When the fiancee got the pizza home, I even noticed a beautiful grease spot on one of the corners of the box (love)!  I know I've been praising the pizza forever now but, I just want to mention the fiancee's Easter Pie.  While he was waiting on the pie to be done, he asked the owner what the \"thing\" in the case was.  He said it was Easter Pie.  The owner cut off a slice for him to try, for free!  Todd tried it and the rest is history.  Needless to say, he bought a huge slice for himself.    I did mention in the 3rd sentence of this review, I sent Todd out for a pie (one, singular, uno item).  Well, as you know up until this point that he comes home with the pie and the Easter Pie.  He also bought a meatball sub.  Give 'em (men) an inch, they take a yard.  He said it was good but, too much sauce.  Thank you Cugino's for keeping it east coast, and Peter A. for your helpful review and pics!  Cugino's we are fans and will continue to drive from the opposite side of town to inhale your food!",

My friend has tried the chicken parm sandwich and liked that as well.  I've also tried the garlic knots, and while I liked them not sure if I'd order them again. Not because they're \"knot\" good, but because the sandwich fills me up and I wasn't able to finish them. Maybe I'd get them and share.  I haven't tried the pizza yet...maybe next time.",

Good, no frills service that's quick and efficient.    Now I have a caveat...although I've come here many times I've only ordered the meatball sub, cause it's the best in town. The meatballs are made the right way, covered with a good marinara and mozzarella, then toasted, giving the edges of the bread a crispy texture that juxtaposes well against the tender meatballs.   My only beef with this place is the price.  They used to be really cheap, closer to 5 bucks for lunch, now it's closer to 10.  But they make up for it once I bite into that sub.  A coworker gets the eyetalian sub and it's packed with so much meat he eats on it for 2 days.  But for me, Cugino's is all about the meatball sub.",

    "text": "First of all, I would like to start by saying I honestly do not know what any of these bad reviewers are talking about. From the second my husband and I walked in, we were greeted with a smile and amazing service(HE is from Minnesota, and was the one who ordered, so their politeness had nothing to do with the fact that the owners & myself are both from NY). I do not ever give 5 star reviews, but this place deserves it. Having just moved to Vegas from NYC, I expected to have to have my father Fed-Ex us pizza from our local pizza spot if I ever wanted to to eat good pizza again. Well, THANK GOD for Cugino's for making that unnecessary! I am Italian and normally make my own amazing-if-I-do-say-so-myself sauce. When I took a bite of their Sicilian pizza and their sauce tasted EXACTLY like mine(and my mother's, and my grandmother's), I knew I had found a piece of home here in Vegas. The crust had the perfect amount of thickness, and just enough cheese, but not too much, which is just the way I like it. My husband ordered a chicken cutlet hero with lettuce, tomato, and mayo; it was absolutely AMAZING. The sandwich had more than enough chicken to cover the bread, the cutlets were perfectly breaded, and the Italian bread it was on was just right for the perfect sandwich. The owner came over while we were eating to make sure everything was right with our food, and to ask us how we liked the place. This is definitely the best pizza & deli you are going to find in Vegas. P.S. I'd like to send a nice kick in the butt to all the people with negative comments about this place; you obviously do not know what good pizza tastes like, nor are accustomed to quality, home-made food. =)",

Our flight doesn't leave until 11:15 pm so we checked out of Planet Hollywood. We booked a room at a great very boutique feeling Fairfield inn on Paradise Rd instead of being miserable hanging around the airport and decided to order take-out. The lady at the desk recommended Cuginos. We ordered online and it came direct to our room. It was hot and absolutely delicious. We ordered for two and they delivered enough food for at least four hungry people. It also tasted like authentic Italian. I highly recommend this place. Great value and great food.",

    "text": "Cugino's is the real deal.  Its like I was transported into Queens when I stepped in the place.  Hard to believe that such an awesome little Italian Deli & Market can exist a stone's throw from UNLV in a non-descript mini-mall.    The sandwiches could lay claim to the best in Las Vegas.  I'm not quite ready to make that claim 100% but give me a couple weeks and I might be able to.  The meats and cheeses are freshly sliced Boars Head products and the bread is crisp yet soft.  No I know a lot of you're are probably saying \"A lot of places use Boars Head, thats nothing special.\"  Well you're right in one regards but the mixture of ingredients, the freshness of the produce and care put in assembly make this sandwich truly magnificent.  Personally, Im a fan of the #2 Italian with capicolla.    Not a sandwich fan?  No problem, the pasta and pizza is just as good.  The pasta tastes as if some old Italian mama is in the back making it for her son and his mafioso pals.  Al dente and always the perfect blend of meat, cheese and sauce.  The pizza is phenomenal for Las Vegas.  In New York it would be above average, but with a dearth of good joints out here, this pizza is noteworthy.    I must make time to also acknowledge the garlic knots.  A great appetizer and just loaded with flavor and grease....a worthy combination, especially when I need a break from studying over at the UNLV library.    Cugino's also has a number of pastas, salamis, sauces and other Italian specialty products for sale besides their prepared foods.  There are a small number of tables if you wish to dine in, but service is at the counter.  I love the causal ethos of the place.  The staff is helpful and you get the feeling they are East Coast to the bone.    People are starting to discover Cugino's but it still amazes me that the Chipotle in front is always busy and people don't realize there is this gem 100 feet behind it.",

The cheese was excellent with a delicious flavor and fresh moistness.  The bread was tasty and overall, all the ingredients just worked together perfectly.

Had the Italian #2, it was a great size and delicious, if I wasn't so full I would have had another! The garlic cheese bread was great and the marinara was the BEST I've ever had- don't tell my grandmother on my Italian side.  Can't wait to try the Meatball Parm and the Sausage and Pepper sandwiches- mmm, I'm drooling thinking about it.  Definitely going to be going as often as the skinny wallet will allow (it's such a pleasant change from my usual packed lunches that I bring to campus)  I always knew about this place but I wish I tried it sooner!",

We ordered a cheese pizza, fresh tomato & basil (that came with approximately 8 small pieces of basil, but lots of garlic the garlic, the only nice surprise), cannoli (flavor was good, but it was unusually crunchy and we couldn't get over the texture) and a tiramisu which we haven't tried yet - we couldn't because we are in a hotel room (which they knew, they delivered it to us) and were not given any plates, napkins, a fork to eat the tiramisu with... Nothing.  Even with that, the BIGGER disappointment was how long it took. It was estimated at 45-60 minutes delivery through Eat24 and it took 90 minutes!!!!  At 80 minutes I used the check order status stating we still had no food and their reply was \"We know you're hungry (we're hungry too!)\".   What?!?!?  Really?!?!? Ok, but YOU didn't order the food 80 minutes ago!!!  It's NOT about YOU, it's about an unhappy customer who gave you an opportunity to explain the delay and when we could expect our food to arrive. We received ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Not likely to order through this again. Not happy.  I wouldn't order delivery if you're actually hungry.",

Let me tell you Cugino's is a diamond here in the Las Vegas desert. If your looking for a good Italian pastries/pies, Italian ice, Bronx Special Sandwich (fried eggplant,, red peppers, mozz, and sauce), or Pizza this is the place you gotta come too! ----Oh the homemade cannoli's yum!!  They even have a great grocery store with a ton of Italian cuisines (pastas, meats) you can only find at Cuginos.  The family that runs the place is very friendly and accommodating, so if you want something you had in New York they can most likey make it.  These people are straight from Italy via New York so you know you're gonna get some real great food. I highly recommend that if you come to Vegas or you're a local you should defiantly eat or shop at Cugino's over and over again.  I just wish it was closer to Sacramento!",

I love the deli and the various Italian products. I love that when I was feeling under the weather and craving soup, they had pasta fagioli (and other soups, too) Do you know how hard it is to find a big  bowl of hearty soup around UNLV? Their caprese salad was a bit pricey at first glance ($8.99) but they give you a lot of fresh sliced mozzarella with basil and garlic. Again, where else am I going to get caprese salad within reasonable walking distance from campus? I am sad I didn't come sooner.",

As per the previous reviews on Yelp, we also got some garlic knots.  The garlic knots were fantastic- warm, crispy yet chewy, and covered in garlic butter with chunks of fresh garlic and parsley. The meatball sub had a bright tangy marinara sauce, fresh slabs of mozzarella and a soft yet crusty bread. The meatballs were amazing- very well seasoned with a fine texture. The same sauce and meatballs were in the spaghetti special. The pasta was perfectly al dente. This was our first meal after 4 hours of traveling on the road and it hit the spot completely.",

Two things that are often hard to find in Vegas.... at least of this quality. I couldn't wait to eat my pizza so ate a slice in the car on the way back to the office and it was glorious. Brings me back to the good old days back in NY.  If you haven't had a sicilian pizza, you are missing out and this is one of the best in town. They go a little heavier on the cheese than I like but that is typical for sicilian pies. I prefer mine with less cheese and more sauce. After all, anyone can get good cheese... not everyone can make a good sauce.  The rice ball was great as always... walking into this deli is like transporting right to Brooklyn for me. If this place was just a bit closer to work (or home) I would probably be there a few times a week.",

In the 7 years I've been a regular here they've never disappointed.  It's also a small Italian market if you need to grab the real deal ingredients for a perfect meal without any hassle. What? You're not sure about a recipe? Just ask Donnie or Christopher (the sons.) The entire family is happy to help.   Bottom line, from sandwiches to fine dining style pasta dishes, and easily some of Las Vegas' best pizza. Did i mention the scratch salads? Olive, artichoke hearts, potato, Mac, mushroom.  Wait, the fresh sausage and Mammas meatballs.  I guarantee you'll feel like you just visited the Bronx.  Go for it.",

Turns out, I am not Italian, but for 45 minutes last Saturday...I felt Italian.  Cugino's is exactly what I look for in an Italian deli.  Pasta and cans of tomatoes on the shelves, a nice selection of meats, cheeses, olives, and sausage, and a couple old school guys behind the counter with white shirts and white aprons.  I walk up to the counter to the appropriate greeting of \"How ya doin?\"  I respond to that question with the appropriate answer (which happens to be the same question) \"How ya doin?\"  The guy behind the counter then asks, \"Whaduya havin'?  We ordered the Italian Combo#2 and the Meatball Parm sandwiches, a couple bags of chips, and drinks.  The total came to around $20 and we both left stuffed.   The Italian sandwich came loaded with salami, capicola (gabbagool), provolone, and I asked to add some pepperocinis.  Don't forget about the bread, which is the key to the success of this sandwich.  We will be heading back in our next Vegas trip for sure.  This is a nice lunch option and break from the smoke filled and overpriced casinos.",

Both of our sandwiches (the Godfather for me - eggplant, fresh HOMEMADE mozzarella and roasted red peppers, and Donnie's special for my husband - Chicken cutlets, fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers and balsamic and oil). We enjoyed 2 cannoli's for dessert and learned they are made with homemade ricotta cheese - which explains why they were so light and creamy.

I ordered one to go, was quoted 10 min but ended up 30 min....but whatever, it was lunch rush etc.  My issue was with the sandwich itself. The meat had no flavor, so probably wasn't seasoned. The onions were caramelized, which gave the sandwich a sweet taste. This wouldn't be such a problem had they properly seasoned the beef, which would have balanced the sweetness of the onions. Next issue was the cheese. They just melted some on top and didn't actually incorporate it into the meat, which caused the beef grease to saturate the bread making parts of the sandwich inedible.   I give 3 stars, because everything else I've had has been on point. But if you want a good cheese steak, go somewhere else.",

    "text": "From past experience, it seems like every Italian deli I happen to go to always seems to have good eats whether it's pizza, sandwiches or pasta not to mention the selling of good products like deli meats, olives, cheeses, and of course bread!  Cugino's fits this criteria. As you come in you see all the deli meats (Boar's Head is what they are representing), pizza and garlic knots behind the glass case, and Italian groceries lined along the walls.  I came for lunch so something hot was what I was looking for. On their menu I see all sorts of hot sandwiches from meatball and pastrami to Italian sausage and several aptly named sandwiches (which I am more than happy to check out the next 20 visits or so!)  I went with my all time favorite, Philly Cheesesteak with all the fixins'. It is I would say about 8 inches in length cut in half. From my pic you can see the melted mozzarella on top of grilled, thinly slice peppered meat mixed with green peppers and onions. Man, my mouth is watering just typing this. As for the bread, WOW! Crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. One bite and I knew this bread was freshly baked here because I could probably eat the bread by itself.  Service was great from beginning to end. I came in, ordered, sat down, and they brought my sandwich out to me. From that point on, I didn't get up until I finished my sandwich.   The atmosphere has that New York/Italian feel to it. On the walls are posters of New York teams like the Mets, Yankees, Knicks, Jets, and Giants. This place is exactly what you find on the corner of just about any street in New York.  Overall, I cant wait to come back and try everything else. These guys are kind of hidden in this plaza towards the back. Once you find it, you will definitely remember where they are from now on.",

This was our first time ever trying this restaurants food. So it was very disappointing. My husband still ate the pizza he just rearranged the toppings. I also had the shrimp Alfredo. Which half of the shrimp in my entree weren't cooked all the way. I ended up picking out the rest of the shrimp and ate the pasta which was still good. But sadly the pizza incident just ruined it.

While I saw my sub being made, I went out on a limb and asked for \"extra hots\" (what I call hot giardiniera) but got a confused look. Instead, I was offered a \"spicy spread\" for a $1 upcharge, which in hindsight I probably should've taken them up on so I could try it, but then he offered me jalapenos for free - which worked out great.  Be prepared for New York style, no-BS, deli counter rapport. Know what you want (or at least pretend you know what you want?) or else step back and let the next customer go at it. An efficient (albeit slightly intimidating) system.  Always fun to find a new spot in your hometown - especially if it's a good one!",

You can buy east coast products, pickup some Boar's Head deli meat, and enjoy some hot pasta or pizza.  Check out their lunch specials all reasonably priced. Try either the Reuben or Pastrami sandwiches very delicious, made from excellent products. They are a must here. The meatballs and parm sandwich was alright, messy and feel apart on me. They also have pizzas, Italian ice, canolis, etc which I haven't tried yet. Lots of cans of Napoli tomato sauce. They get busy during lunch and there's tables inside and out. Their fountain drinks are refillable so don't worry if you run out of drink since they give a lot of ice. Excellent service, fast and friendly.

The cannoli was delicious and was perfectly crunchy and not chewy. It was expensive but I would say it's worth it. If you want amazing pizza I would recommend this place.

    "text": "A True NY style Italian deli located right across from UNLV at Maryland and Harmon. Plenty of parking in the private parking lot.   I was craving a salami sandwich and we all know how hard it is to find a great sandwich around this town. I remember seeing my Yelp friends checking in here and made the drive. Was is it worth it? Definitely!   We were quickly greeted as we walked in and I immediately felt like I was at an east coast italian family deli. So many imported pastas and specialties from Italy like balsamic glaze, muffaletta spread, cans of San Marzano tomatoes, peppers and a large selection of Italian cookies.   They also have a great selection of homemade sides like macaroni salad, potato salad, marinated eggplant, rice balls and desserts. I ordered the #2 Italian which was Salami and Cappicola with Provolone cheese on a hero roll and a small cannoli for dessert. I loved the bread they use, so soft and just how I remember as a kid. I wish they had used Italian dry salami instead of Genoa salami but that's a small complaint.   The cannoli was excellent, a perfectly small dessert filled with sweet cream and chocolate chips. Thankfully they don't add the orange zest flavor which many places add. I don't get to this area often but when I do I am absolutely coming back to try one the hot subs which looked great. Meatball, chicken or eggplant?",

That being said, the food was abysmal. This was my first time there. I had the linguine and white clam sauce and my friend had the lasagna. The linguine was horrible. It had a smell reminiscent of a fish dock in the summer. The lasagna was a warmed over lump of congealed cheese and pasta with sauce. We ended up taking both items in a to go box and then disposing of them.  I am hoping that we hit there on a bad day. My friend wants me to try again.... I am not there... yet.",

    "text": "Sweet Mother of homemade Mozzarella, this place is the bomb! Last night of working in Vegas and my buddy wants Italian. For whatever reason, a little voice in my head whispers \"Cugino's\". Now, I've never heard nor seen this place, so I found it pretty serendipitous that it was first on the list when I looked up Italian joints. Intuition, I thank you. Although small and unassuming, this humble joint served me some of the best lasagna I've had in years. Simple, yet elegant. Messy, yet comforting. Their espresso was genuine, as were the owners who served us. We were treated to samples of their homemade cheeses and conversations of home, fighting, and naps. It was a refreshing lil slice of New York charm and know how hidden in this bustling desert. If you claim to love traditional Italian cuisine and you pass up the chance to come by this jewel, shame on you. Finally, in the land of glitz and glam, augmented attitudes and body parts, I've found a place I can feel at home.",

We asked about pizza, and they failed to tell us about the specials. We saw the sign afterwards.  The large white clam pizza($17) was ok, the dough was on the dry side, no flavor at all and it was not raised properly. The pizza did come with a lot of chopped clam. But the large amount of clam made the pizza fishy. Also there was a good amount of cheese, which I think was not necessary.  Personally, I think pizza should be about the dough. Without a good dough, you are just trying to cover incompetence with lots of toppings.  This place is definitely overrated and overpriced.",

We had a green salad, a Chicken Parm sandwich and a couple orders of Garlic knots.  It felt like all the customers that streamed in (including a large family) were regulars - and I got the impression all the adults were from New York, and many were tattoo clad.  The cold sandwiches are large. The hot sandwiches were smaller than I thought they would be - but delicious none the less.  There was no music playing, which was a relief. I really hate music in restaurants. They had a couple TVs quietly playing a current sporting event.  Tons of stuff to catch your eye and genuine Deli atmosphere really made this an enjoyable lunch. I would go again in a heartbeat.",

When you walk in and look to the left you will see the wall lined with all the ingredients that they use in their kitchen.. which they also have for sale.. They have a little deli area where they also sell the meats & cheeses they use.  EVERYTHING IS FRESH.. their pizza dough, ingredients, etc. They also offer gluten free crust..  ok so not sure how many of you know how to test the crust of your pizza crust.. lol but you pick it up & hold it up.. if your piece of pizza stays extended out & can stay held up then the crust is perfect.. if your piece of pizza falls over & all your toppings fall off... thats bad pizza crust.. lol. So obviously my pepp pizza passed the test.. lol.   Their salads are amzing.. the knots are flavorful & perfect size. The sandwiches are HUGE and so good.. when you call to order to go ask about their sandwiches on special.. they come up with some pretty good combinations. the meat & cheeses are quality!",

It is a great place to enjoy the best sandwich and to be around a family that you can truly tell enjoy what they do.  They use boars head meats and cheeses for their sandwiches...the best bread, soft on the inside and harder on the outside, but not heavy like a lot of torpedo bread... and the cookies are yum yum yummy!

I had the grilled chicken sandwich with broccoli rabe (leaves) and it's very tasty.  The chicken breast is very moist and soaked in all of the flavors.  What a good deal at $9.99.  My mother in law had the linguine with clams, which was cooked al dente.  Not bad, a classic dish, big portion.  Another good deal at $14.99.  My wife had the pastrami sandwich, very lean meat but still moist and perfectly seasoned with a good peppery taste.  You won't ask \"where is the beef\" as the sandwich is huge.  Ordered the garlic knots and rice balls as sides, as if we needed to eat more.  Both were excellent!  Goes well with the classic marinara sauce they provide.  A great find, as I'm getting tired of the eating places on the Strip, getting too pricey.",

Open my food up in the Staff Lounge, and there's this nice bit of steam coming from the top of my Rigatoni Bolognese. The bread was warm, and my salad was all fresh. Oh my gah... I was never let down then, and I wasn't let down tonight.  Same family running it, and they're still one of the friendliest people around =D",

The ingredients are high quality and well blended.  Got the eggplant one and the garlic and basil were incredible. Oh and don't forget to get a cannoli. They are fabulous.

Too be honest, it seemed like a pie you get out of a microwave at the airport. With the $5 delivery charge and tip, the barely edible pizza cost me $20 -- not worth it at all. They were also out of garlic knots. The only good thing I can say about them is the delivery lady was nice.",

The pizza had the most intense, yet not overwhelming or harsh, tomato taste I've ever experienced. I don't know what they do to that sauce, but keep doing it! Everything was so, so good.

Hurtin' real bad. Hurtin' for that pizza, son. I love California but good pizza is not our specialty. So what does a girl do? She makes sure to hit up highly rated pizza spots by a guy who definitely knows pizza whenever she can.   So was it worth it? HELL YES. Oh my God, this pizza made my pizza dreams come True! It is True New York style and better than any New York Style pizza I've had in SoCal, that's for damn sure. Add to it the fact that this place is super cute, really authentic, and owned by cool ass New York Italians. My friend and I had a conversation with the owners when they found out we were from Elizabeth and they're from Staten Island which is literally only a single bridge apart. I wanted to love this place, and I did. I got an extra pie to bring home to my husband, and he was over the moon. We were so sad when we finished it all. Next time, we'll get another pie and freeze it. Oh! We also tried their cannolis - YUM! I was a little nervous because every Cannoli I've had out here on the west coast has been a disappointment - not this one!!! As a matter of fact, that's how our conversation with the owner started. He asked us if we ever had a cannoli before and I said, \"Oh, we're from the east coast, we know allll about cannolis.\" *sigh* I'm sad just thinking about the fact that I'll have to wait months if not a year to have this in my life again.  I might be overshooting a bit. I'm sure people who are used to having great pizza around them all the time may feel differently, but as far as NY style goes, this is it. And as far as cute, authentic, Italian markets go, this is it. I'll come here over some hoity toity \"Eataly\" in Los Angeles where you spend an arm and a leg for specialty bullshit any day of the week.   Cugino's, I'll be dreaming of you. Until next time...",

When I walk in, I feel like walking into a New York deli/restaurant.  Great atmosphere!  They have a whole menu of pizzas, pasta, sandwiches and sweet treats.  Their pizza is right on target with New York-style pizza.  The crust is thin and is rigid enough to fold in half without sagging.  Nice crunch and not soggy.  Tried their linguine and white clam sauce and it was delicious!  For dessert, we had one of their cannoli.  Right on spot!  Cugino's also had Italian cookies, just like those sold in New York bakeries.  They had rainbow cookies.  Had to buy some!  Also, I noticed they sell Stella Doro cookies.  Only a native New Yorker would know how traditional these cookies are.  I grew up on them!  This is owned and ran by a native NY family from Staten Island.  So, of course, they know how to do it all \"New York-style!\"  Will be back!!!!",

Located directly across the UNLV campus, a mum and pop pizza joint owned by a New York family and it has that \"feel\" when you walk in.   The last time I went I order the philly cheesesteak and it was flavorful! Their ingredients are really good quality and the portions are plentiful.    I've tried several of their other sandwiches and they stay consistent with great flavor, portions, and quality so you can't go wrong if you choose them.   They sell Italian products such as pasta and tomato paste to name a few. They also sell cheeses and cured meats.   There's plenty of seating, service is quick, and food is great.   I'll definitely keep coming here.",

    "text": "We came to Cuginos nearly every day of our trip and almost ordered everything on their menu from the lobster ravioli to their rice balls.   The prices are great and don't hurt your wallet unless you're like us and order 10 things at a time. (What can I say? I go hard for things/people I like!) It's definitely a family run kind of place. You get the same guy taking your order whether it's right before closing time or during the lunch rush.   I definitely became addicted to their Sicilian pizza because it's a thick crust, almost like focaccia, and their delicious sauce and cheese on top was just a cherry on top. The one item I wouldn't recommend ordering is the lobster ravioli. It was kind of bland and definitely expected a little more and I sort of wish it wasn't nearly $20 because it was like 6 raviolis. Kind of feel like that was the biggest scam in Las Vegas but hey, everything else is stellar so I really shouldn't complain.   Ultimately, if you're trying to decide on a place in the area, do not pass up a chance to get Cuginos. It's definitely a great experience and your stomach and wallet with thank you.",

We always salivate over the stuff they have for sale behind the glass, and one day I will remember to bring a cold bag and blue ice to protect hunks of deli stuff all the way back to Los Angeles.  The last time we were there, we saw a girl that looked like a supermodel standing next to a gentleman that could've been the Papa Smurff of the business. They posed for photos and held up the order line for a minute, but none of the people waiting seemed to mind; they stopped drooling over the menu for a moment to take her in.

I've been pleased with every single order. The food is amazing, from sandwiches to desserts.  A few of our favorites that I recommend to everyone:  -Neapolitan Rice Balls, basically fried balls of risotto. I've made meals out of these and nothing else. The Sicilian balls are really good too, but I prefer the meatless ones.  - Seasoned wedge fries. You get a huge amount for a couple dollars and they are the best I've had. Perfectly seasoned and always fresh.  -Homemade Hot Turkey sandwich. My boyfriend would eat it every day if he could. It's basically Thanksgiving on a roll and a little slice of happy.  -Ruben Melt, the best I've ever had. Oh man, now I want one.  -Cannoli. It's obviously freshly made and perfect if you want something lightly sweet and creamy.  -Cheesecake. I'll admit it's not the most amazing cheesecake I've ever had, but it's still damn good. I mostly want to point out that this is the best delivery cheesecake I've found. Most places have sad little prepackaged slices of mediocre cheesecake. But Cugino's has big, beautiful slices that don't appear to have been frozen or mass produced. 9/10, would nom again.  If I keep going, I'll end up listing the entire menu.  To top it off, the service is always excellent. We always got the same delivery woman and I adored her. Super sweet, very fast and professional. I can't recall a single order error and even on busy days, service was prompt and quality was through the roof.   Tl;dr this place is fabulous.",

    "text": "Tony Soprano is in the back, salivating over the possibility that Don will let him have at the antipasto...  First of all, if you haven't been to Cugino's, you might've wasted most of your life until now...at least lunch hour.  This is the real thing, and in Las Vegas, that's saying something.  In Brooklyn, Cugino's would be found in the side of some brick building lacquered with 100 years of patina and the best sauce that Nona can make.  In Las Vegas, the closest thing to brick is 30-year old stucco, but inside, the feel is right and the smell is amazing.  Having eaten everything on the menu (literally, everything, from the Frutta di Mare to the Tuna Salad to the Don's Special), I have some favorites.  If you were to ask me about the last thing I'd eat on earth, it would be the Eggplant Rollatini and Penne ala Vodka.  These two dishes are my usuals for the past few years.  Why? Simplicity.  The Eggplant is sliced thin and breaded, fried and rolled around creamy, luscious ricotta and marinara filling, and then baked in marinara and mozzarella.  It is fork-tender, which is not the case with most eggplant, and about the only thing I've never gotten bored of eating.  Follow that up with a plate of Penne ala Vodka - the best Vodka sauce I've ever had...so good, in fact, I stopped making my own!  Other great things on, and off, of the menu include the Reuben on marble rye, the Don's Special, either Americano sandwich, and the Antipasto salad.  The sandwiches come with a drink, and the entrees come with a fresh salad and bread.  Another note, everything here is made in house, from the cheese to the salads to the sauces and desserts - one exception is the pasta, which is brought in from a maker in Brooklyn who, it was explained to me, makes it as good as can be made.  One final note, Cugino's is a deli and, as such, has meats and cheeses for sale, along with a large variety of imported Italian brand products, like tomatoes, cookies, oil, Arborio rice and Lavazza coffee.  I could go on, but that would mean writing a dissertation; it's better if you just go grab a cappuccino and a plate of macaroni (Also, why not support a great, local, family-owned business)...  Buon Appetito!",

Great place to go for lunch, get a homemade cannoli and an espresso then some groceries for home!  Awesome family run Italian deli and restaurant.",

The ones I was most interested in. Arghghhh",

Their marinara sauce really steals the shows. Delicious. We also got the tiramisu and it was better than most other places, but not the best!. Felt like it had been frozen, because I got a couple of ice crystals. I will most certainly go there if I am ever in Vegas again, and highly recommend it to anyone.",

A quaint mom and pop shop lined with Italian foodstuffs and a simple deli, I was disappointed to see that they had lunch specials at the last minute. I probably could have saved myself a few dollars ($12-something vs. $5.99 for two honking slices of pizza and an average sized beverage).  The money I spent was well paid. I really enjoyed my calamari (homemade marinara, please!) and my lone slice of cheese.  I will definitely be back to further explore their menu. Can you say, \"vodka sauce?\"",

They are moist, not greasy and filled with a delicious meat/ mozzarella  center. Their fried gnocchi are also worth a try along with the pasta fagioli soup.  They have many specials and offer eat in or take out. I learned that they are transplanted New Yorkers (Staten Island) which explains the familiarity we felt.

I had a slice of Cheese Pizza to get the lunch started while I waited for my sandwich.  The sandwich came out and was the perfect portion, not too large, not too small.  They use Boar's Head deli meat, which is one of my favorites.  The bread is good and there's just the right amount of oil/vinegar...not too overwhelming like some other sandwich joints.  What a great lunch.  Will I return?  What's the mattah you!....of course!",

I chose the meat Arancini (rice ball) and a stuffed pepper and one slice of cheese pizza. The stuffed pepper was so delicious I wanted to go back for more, but I restrained myself. The Arancini was delicious, and my pizza was perfect, one of the first times in my life I didn't want ranch to dip it in. The crust had a perfect amount of crunch to it, and the slice had a perfect folding diameter, you may need to blot the cheese a couple times, it was a little oily.

I have a soft spot for everything and anything Italian, so this place was absolute perfection in my eyes. It's a family owned deli and the people who work there are great! They remember their customers and make conversation with them to make sure the food is to their liking.   So far I have tried the Calamari, Frutta Di Mare, and the Spaghetti and meatballs.   -The spaghetti and meatballs was the first thing I tried from Cugino's and let me tell you it definitely hooked me. The pasta was cooked to a perfect texture and the meatballs were quite tasty.   -The Calamari was served in a generous portion and was cooked exactly the way I like it. The breading was well seasoned and tasted great with the marinara sauce. Definitely a favorite of mine.  - The Frutta Di Mare was a mix of clam meat, mussel meat, tiny shrimp, and calamari in a zesty red sauce over a bed of linguine. The seafood was plentiful and wasn't too overpowering, which I enjoyed.   I think this place is definitely a must try here in Vegas. If you haven't tried Cugino's already, you are missing out.",

    "text": "This is a HUGE FIND in Las Vegas where delicious pizza seems to be a mystery.  The storefront is in a little strip mall by UNLV and is 100% worth going trying.  We ordered a white pizza and a pepperoni pizza, an antipasto salad and they gave us an extra little order of the bulk antipasto to try.    The pizza was INCREDIBLE!!!!!  And for $30 for all of it we were pleasantly surprised.  I would recommend this to anyone and will be going back to try some of their other items - I saw their meatballs and they looked incredible too.    Try this place!!!!!!!!",

My #2 had Salami, Cappicolo and Provolone, very simple right?  It was one flavorful sandwich, with a bang.  The ingredients, meats and cheese were fresh as you could taste the flavors of everything.  I especially loved the Cappicolo, which provided such a kick to the sandwich.  I've eaten Cappicolo before but, it was more like cRappicolo because it never tasted anything like this!  The s/o ordered one of their Canolli's.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw?select=ub8c8QJ5J1U2B-hbfpYvLA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Mh84...</a>  It was delish and cheap!  I love everything about Cugino's; their shop, the food, the overall feel, the smell of the shop, not sure what it is but Italian deli's have \"that smell\" and lastly, the family that runs it is pretty nice.  Cugino's, among the million other things about Vegas, sure makes me wish I lived there, well maybe more towards Henderson. :)  In the meantime, my jealousy shall continue.",

Not only is the pizza excellent, but its consistently excellent. Some places wander in terms of quality, but Cugino's pizza has been great every time. The other food on the menu is real good as well, (I particularly like the chicken parm hero), but it's the pizza that is the big draw.   The other real strong point about Cugino's is the deli.  They have a wide variety of products like Italian cold cuts, fresh cheese, and other on the shelf products that are not easily found elsewhere in the valley.   Cugino's is a fantastic place to drop by for lunch or a quick dinner and always recommend it to anyone who will listen.",

My friend was in town and we were going back to her hotel room for pizza and wine (and if you must know, Britney Spears on the X-factor). We had stopped earlier for wine, but like doofuses we did not think about getting the wine open. They let us use their corkscrew to open up our wine and we returned it and went on our merry way. They could have told us to screw off, but instead they let us borrow it and were nice about it, too.  As for the pizza, I was not as impressed as I expected to be. It was flavorful and the toppings were fresh, but the crust didn't have the crusty-qualities that I look for in a pizza. However, I would be willing to try it again because it is a straight-up deli with olives, pasta salad, sandwiches, various other deliciousness. Plus they were just such nice people that I want to patronize their establishment again!",

We tried the Sicilian tripe soup. Didn't know Italians like tripe but I guess they do. Think of this soup as minestrone with pieces of tripe that are easy to chew because sometimes it could seem like you are chewing on rubber.  I recommend going for the hot sandwiches instead of the  cold ones since they seem to have more flavor.",

This is a family-owned Italian grocery and restaurant with pastas, antipasti, homemade pizza, Boars Head meats, deli sandwiches, eggplant parmesan, you name it. I have a particular fondness for their bread.  They look like mini loaves of baguette, and they are served warm.  Holy (@$)*% once I ordered three to go and thought I would share them with coworkers but I ate them all walking back to my office!!!  They also have yummy garlic knots! Today was a particularly stressful day - I was up til 3AM typing a paper, then got up early for work of course and felt like I deserved something yummy for lunch.  Cugino's has arancini - fried risotto balls stuffed with cheese rolled in seasoned breadcrumbs, served hot with marinara sauce.  WHOA, right?!  I added a mini baguette thingy and wa-la!  Carbilicious! These are super delicious, very different from the truffled ones at Ferraro's (those are more refined of course, and smaller).  I had 2 of these and that was plenty.  yum yum yum they only make a certain amount per day so I better not tell you any more of my noshing secrets :)  Oh yeah and the whole meal cost me under $4.",

I actually almost shed a tear of relief discovering this place today. I've lived in Las Vegas for about 2 years, and I'd just given up on the hope of real Brooklyn pizza. Settebello pizza is good for what it is, more like the pizza you get in Italy. Nothing wrong with that. But when I've had a taste for NY pizza I've always been disappointed. Metro Pizza was suggested to me once by a friend, and after trying it I immediately punched him in the face. Don't worry, he's fine now.   The owners/staff of Cugino's are all Italian from Brooklyn. The place is a deli and italian grocery, so you can buy all the best meats, Italian canned goods, homemade raviolis, manicotti, stuffed shells, as well as marinated salads and mozzarella that they make there DAILY.  The sandwiches are just flawless. Even the little things I've missed like coffee soda they had there.  Honestly I wasn't even planning on trying the pizza. I'd had enough disappointments  on that front already.  But as proud italians and proud New Yorkers, they insisted. And I'm SO glad they did.",

    "text": "I'm staying at the Westgate Resort.  I researched pizza places that delivered to this hotel and this was one of several.  So I placed my order online, requesting delivery service.  Not having any doubt at all that the pizza would be delivered to my room.  I've stayed at hotels before and have never had a problem with deliveries to my room. So the delivery person called me about 20 min later saying she's leaving the restaurant now and I'll have to meet her at outside.  I'm at a hotel, thus the reason I ordered delivery.  I don't want to get dressed and wait for the elevator and go through the whole hotel to go outside and get my order and then carry my pizza plus two other full bags back through the hotel and wait in line for 10 minutes for the elevator and take it up to my room.  That is the whole point of delivery! And, I tipped!  I wouldn't have tipped had I known they weren't going to bring it up to my room! The delivery driver told me she couldn't bring it up to my room, hotel rules.  So I get presentable, go down 17 floors, find the guest services desk, ask them where the East entrance is, walk through the hotel to find the correct entrance, and go outside and get my pizza.  During the elevator ride up, there's a guy carrying a pizza.  I think, well he's smarter than I am, he probably just got pizza from inside the hotel and is taking it up to his room.  So imagine my surprise when I get off the elevator, and see that he gets off at my same floor, and walks down my same  hallway, and knocks on the door next to my room and hands off the pizza to my neighbors!  I asked him what delivery company he was from (Milano's) for future reference. To make it worse, there are no plates and napkins in my bags - I'm in a hotel! Do you think I have my own plates and napkins?!  AND, the pizza was supposed to have green bell peppers, but instead came with red.  I called the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager.  I was told the manager was not in and they didn't know when he/she would be available because they're very busy.   So, long story short, if you're staying at the Westgate in Vegas, or any hotel, make sure you confirm with the restaurant that they will be delivering to your room.",

It very new york style; lots of grease, lots of cheese lol. All in all it was a great place to eat. Make sure you get there early cuz it gets packed.",

The pizza was also bland.  If you are looking for this type of items, go out of your way to Spaghetty Western off southern highlands parkway in Las Vegas.  They have an incredible Italian sandwich and make their own pasta.",

    "text": "When I was in the area today, I remembered reading the favorable reviews for Cugino's. It is a cute Italian deli with self order counter, large selection of bottled beverages, grocery items and deli meats/cheeses. I eagerly ordered the Eggplant Parm Sandwich and oh, so disappointed! I was expecting so much more from the great reviews.  First of all, I believe the joy in eating eggplant parm is that creamy texture of the eggplant and the crispy fried breading.  Both fell short.  The eggplant was sliced so thin that there was no texture expect for the stringy skin and the the breading soggy like it had been fried and left sitting.  Come on now, the pictures for the deli sandwiches were nice and meaty. Eggplant is a lot cheaper than deli meat!  For $8 I was expecting a better looking and tasting sandwich, I left there hungry!  The sandwich had 3 limpy strips of eggplant with some marinara only on the top with cheese served with two pepperoncini's on the side. I also thought it was odd that the eggplant was cut into long strips?  Why not preserve the natural oval shape of the eggplant and be generous with your eggplant, let it hang out of  the bread a little.  At least your customers would perceive it to be a better value by their first impression.   By the looks of the reviews and what was coming out of the kitchen, pizza must be there top seller. I will never know.  This isn't a place I'd drive from Summerlin to try again.",

    "text": "When it comes to Las Vegas these days it is easy to find flaws...of course being the epitome of perfection as Rex is...it is easy.  Times have hit this city hard. The days of wine, roses and cheap gas for huffing are over. These are the tough times. The rough times. The decline of western civilization times. The times for poorly written and cliched observations.  Rex gets it. Times are tough for all of us. Rex can relate...a few nights ago he did the unthinkable...he ate at Panda Express.  Rex rarely feels shame but he does now. Rex knows that it is awful. Unthinkable. Rex will admit something else. A few days ago Rex huffed diesel insteal of premium unleaded.  Rex has hit bottom...Rex even considered going to the Circus Circus. Rex wept in shame.  Days went by...Rex could barely endure the horror. He ate at Roccos and plummeted further into a depression. None of the usual things made him feel better. Mocking Andre Agassi's hairline...no joy.  Circling cellulite in Star magazine...no joy. Licking the ground in front of Dairy Queen...no joy. Having sexual intercourse with himself...okay...that wasn't bad. Still...it wasn't the screaming ecstasy that Rex has come to expect.    Rex began to wonder...you know what will cheer Rex up...college coeds. Sexy college chicks. So he visited the strip clubs...and was rudely told that you must wear pants to enter. Rex doesn't wear pants for strip club. Rex called them fascists. Rex was beaten savagely by these pituitary cases...these rejects from the CFL.  Rex woke up in a dumpster near the college...his favorite way to awaken. He smelled good food. He walked. He hoped. He put on pants. He smelled again. He rubbed his eyes. He scratched his crotch vigorously. He wrote on a note pad to look for a used antibiotics bottle during one of his \"treasure\" hunts.  He went inside...he wept.  Cuginos. Cugino's Italian Deli. More beautiful words were never spoken...except the time I said \"please don't wake up Jessica Biel.\" (She didn't.)  Finding this gem in the desert was a shocking turn events for this depressed cow poke...(that was Rex's nickname...Rex \"Cow Poke\" Marvin...don't ask).  Rex was often told that there is NO INTELLIGENCE AT ALL to be found anywhere near UNLV.  After witnessing an after hours party, and scoring with an 18 year old chick who thought i was Brad Pitt's brother, Stu. Stu Pitt.  I thought they were right....but there are all only 99.9% correct.  The owner and operators of Cuginos are BRILLIANT! They are food genius's.    Great sandwiches. Check. Great ingredients. Check. Willing to serve a crying man with no pants. No check...the one strike against them.  Everything Rex has ever had there is brilliant.  Rex must recommend a few things...because that is what Rex does so perfectly.  Donnie's Special is a great sandwich. Chicken is perfectly cooked and seasoned. The fresh mozzarella is the best...more on that in the next paragraph. The Cuginos special is a great cold sandwich...if only slightly under seasoned.  The penne a la vodka is great.  Everything is great. if I had one complaint it would be that most dishes are so delicately seasoned they boarder on under seasoned.   Rex promised to save the best for last...much like Rex in bed. They make their own Mozzerella and it is the best in the city by far and away. New York curds made into pefect cheese...and extremely reasonably priced. Rex always buys some when he is there and chews on it like biting into bread. Just eats it raw.   Rex understands perfection. He lives it. Rarely can you describe anything in the food business as perfect, and not just for these crumbling times in Las Vegas...but for anywhere any time.   Every other deli in the city should look at Cuginos as the blueprint on how to succeed. Reasonably priced. Great food and uncompromising ingredients.   Rex is your perfect love. You are his perfect fool. Rex will be back to Cuginos. Rex will be back for you...and you will love him for it. Rex will leave...and you will love him more for it. Rex will love the cash he took from your purse.",

I had the Sicilian Tripe Soup which was rich in flavor but the taste of the tripe was more pungent.  I personally liked it but it can be more of an acquired taste for others.  I let 2 other people sample it and they said it tasted like ass.  To each their own.    The pastas were pretty decent.  We ordered the Penne ala Vodka with Shrimp.  The pasta was well cooked al dente but the shrimp were frozen and small.  For the price, there are other Italian Deli's like Roma, Rocco's Deli, and Rocco's Pizzeria that are much better.  The Rigatoni Bolognese I sampled from my friend was much better.  As for the pizza, I was not impressed.  I read many reviews that raved about it but it was greasy but I still downed it.  I prefer Rocco's Pizzeria and Rocco's Deli but this place is alright if you're on this side of town.",

    "text": "Seriously where has this place been all my life? I have seen it before passed it so many times and I'm literally thinking to myself what is wrong with you?! Only reason I knew of this place is because the boyfriend had bookmarked it a while ago. I checked it out on yelp saw pictures, read some reviews and that's all I needed. I will admit some places on yelp are all hype but that's something I like to figure out myself. Not this place. Noooo no my friends. This place is the real deal.   Upon seeing it from the outside you wouldn't think it's an actual restraunt with the blinds barely opened. It just looks like a little Italian market. When you go in you see some booths in the middle and cases of San Marzano tomatoes on the side. They have shelves of Italian pastas, sauces and other Italian ingredients. Then my friends is the display case. Italian cheeses, meats, desserts and oh my goodness Italian heaven.   My boyfriend was in the mood for pasta so he ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and I ordered the Italian with Capicola. Not sure what number that is. We sat down and the food came right out.   Spaghetti & meatballs - as tender as the meatballs were they had to be cooking a while & the sauce. Oh man. Real authentic red sauce. Deeeelish.   Italian - they are not playing with this sandwich. Piled high with Salami & capacola topped with thick slices of provolone , lettuce, tomato, onion, oil & vinegar. It's served on freshly baked french bread which I think is important and made the sandwich stand out even more. This was so good. You know it's a good sandwich when you have more meat to bread ratio and that I don't mind at all. Next time I would just ask for a little bit less of the vinegar. Otherwise It was so good. That bread. Oh man that bread.   I can't wait to bring my family here. Yes it's small but when you come here you feel like family. The people who run this place are very helpful and friendly. I can't wait to come back and try the pizza and the rice balls and the meatball sandwich. Omigahhhhh I want to try everything ! Lol I  will definitely be back to try something this place is the bees knees ! Believe the hype. It's real.",

    "text": "As a former (reformed ) New Yorker myself, walking into Cugino's deli fills me with nostalgia for the way things use to be in NY delis in almost any neighborhood. I've been coming here for about four years, dine in and take out and I'm happy every time. Family owned and operated, the boys tend to run the front counter and are some of the nicest guys in the city. They recognize me by name and make me feel like part of the famiglia, cugino means cousin after all.   The food is unabashedly old school \"red sauce New York\" Italian, the kind of comfort food that grandmas pass down from generation to generation of Italian American families. Oft imitated, but rarely perfected, Cugino's delivers a hearty, soul warming meal that scratches that itch for a solid plate of parmigiana drenched in top quality mozzarella and a tangy home style red sauce. Then pizza is authentic too, owing to their Staten Island roots. It's not fancy, it's just what you need when you want a slice of NY pizza to make you long for the old days when your corner pizza joint was the place to go for a snack after work or school.   Their hot sandwiches are tops, try the Sausage and broccoli rabe with provolone, it's one of the best things on a roll in the whole city. They've started offering a Philly favorite too, the roast pork sandwich, which is a classic as well. You can't go wrong with their standard entrees either, the eggplant rollatini is basically cheese heaven with their homemade, creamy ricotta seasoned just right. Sausages made in house by the patriarch of the family, who is a butcher by trade, are top notch.   This is unpretentious, home style cooking, in a charming counter service deli with a few pizzeria style seating areas. Loads of cold cuts and Italian specialties line the walls for purchase, if you need a ton of food to satisfy the masses, they'll cater any event, nothing's too big or too small, they'll accommodate you!    Support these local business and keep Vegas a locals paradise. Thanks guys, for the years of yummy food and making me feel at home every time I come in!!!  Grazie mille!!",

I'm from Rhode Island,. All I miss here in NV. is the N. Y. style hot weiners, made like Rhode Island..  Nice Italian family business. Very friendly, and their pizza, Meatball sandwich, Veal or eggplant dinners are super. The only problem is they are only open till 8:00 on weekends. But otherwise everything is good there, they also have a deli with meats, cheeses and various olives for sale. The Best!!",

Tried garlic cheese bread instead. Good, especially the marinara sauce! Capress salad was good. Spicy Italian sausage sandwich was almost too spicy for me. Should have known with a name like Raging Bull. Also tried the Donnie. It was very good as others have yelped, really worth giving it a try. Chicken parm and cheese tortellini meals rounded out our selections. We all ate everything and are now stuffed. In our defense it was great. Sorry, no room for dessert--so no report on that. Met the owner and his wife--delightful family owned and operated. Highly recommend--they've been in business almost ten years.",

My friend somehow found this place awhile back and has always bought several quarts of sauce (bolognese and something else) while in Vegas, and she raved about everything they had.  Calamari was ON POINT - so fresh, perfectly breaded and fried, and the marinara sauce was BOMB.  Like the best I've ever had.  Rigatoni bolognese was just okay - I've had better bolognese, but this was a really good portion size, and no one is really going to complain about pasta and meat sauce, right?  Really nice service, and it's close to the airport if you want to ever have a good final meal in Sin City.",

The second you walk in the door you immediately feel like you are in an old east coast Italian neighborhood at the corner deli.  This is a family owned business and they are all transplants from New York which makes your experience even better.  They have been in Vegas for 11 years and have been serving real Italian hot and cold deli goodness to the masses ever since.  From the father making fresh mozzarella, the mother creating fresh canolis from scratch with real ricotta cheese, to the son creating killer sandwiches oozing with tons of flavor...this place is THE REAL DEAL.  The food was soo fresh and delicious I had to pick up some fresh meats and mozzarella to go.  They also carry hard to find real Italian market products on their shelves.  WOW WOW WOW... I'm going back tomorrow.",

    "text": "I met two friends here yesterday for lunch.  We wanted to try several things but some of the normal crew couldn't make it.  After a bit of confusion on our part about what to order and the idea of mixing sauces on one pizza-spearate for each half, we got our order in and then had a seat.  This is a no frills, small spot.  My one photo basically shows all the seating except for some not seen on the right.  You get your own plastic ware and napkins from a table to the left of the deli case and there are salt and pepper shakers there and some hot peppers and other spices you might want with Italian food.  We first got fried gnocchi which were OK.  The marinara dipping sauce was good.  Two of us shared a fried rice ball with some tomato sauce and lots of cheese.  It was good.  Next, we had two pizzas.  Yes, three people eating two pizzas.  We got a thin style white pizza and a Sicilian style Margherita pizza.  Needless to say, one of left Cugino's with some leftovers--me.  Andrea enjoyed the pizza tonight.  The pizzas were both good.  I'm spoiled by a white truffle pizza I'm used to getting so this white pizza was a little lacking.  The Margherita was good with a rich sauce and lots of melted cheese.  We also had an order of garlic knots with their good marinara dipping sauce.  For me, this was the star of lunch.  They had good garlic flavor that wasn't lost when dipped in the marinara.  For dessert, we each had a cannoli.  Thank you M.  This is a great lunch place for students because it's right across the street from UNLV's student center.    I think I'll stop in and try some of their deli salads.  That would be my reason for returning.  The rest was good but pretty standard Italian fare.",

    "text": "Found this place through Yelp, read the reviews, decided to try it.  Good move!  Went there on 2011-04-18.  Walked in to what felt like an east coast Italian deli with a few small tables in the middle and a walk-up deli counter to order.  Nothing fancy...  Saw Veal Parm sandwich on the menu - just had to try it!  I haven't had a decent \"veal on a bun\" since living in Little Italy in Toronto... one bite and I was back 25 years to those days!  Beautiful crusty but soft bun, veal sauced just right, cheese, peppers... all freshly made!    I'll be back again before leaving Vegas... now I only have to find a way to relocate them to Phoenix...  Update:  Went back again on 2011-04-21.  Tried a few other items which changed my rating slightly from 5 stars to 4 stars.  I still like this place and need to try more items before settling on a final rating.   This trip, I tried the garlic knots; very garlic-y, but needs either a little salt or a marinara dip to complete it.  Also tried the Jamaican beef patty after reading about it on other reviews here, but was somewhat disappointed.  They're more dough-y than flaky, and the beef filling is a tinge bitter - not sure why.  I love beef patties, so I'm very picky - and what do you expect ordering a Jamaican item from an Italian deli?  (If anyone is in Toronto, Randy's beef patties is much better!)  Ordered the liverwurst sandwich for my other half; it was as good as could be expected for a loaded liverwurst sandwich.  Their home-made bread really makes the difference on their sandwiches!   To be fair, I ordered items outside of their mainline menu this trip, so that affected their rating.  I suspect if we stay with their mainline italian menu items, my ratings will go up again - but that's for another visit.  I'll definitely come back for another try!",

I usually get the large cheese pizza and it's excellent.  I visited NYC for NYE and was able to try NY style pizza in New York.  I ate pizza every day while I was there.  This place definitely comes close and I won't have to fly all the way to NYC to get great pies.  I wish that Cugino's would have some garlic and onion powders so we could put on our pizza though in addition to the Parmesan Cheese and peppers.  Also, the workers here are always so friendly!  We went close to closing (8pm) and they welcomed us with open arms.  We also ordered an order of garlic knots (6pc in an order) and he brought out an extra order of knots for us! Granted, it was close to closing and they were probably going to throw it away anyways, but still, it made us happy!  Definitely a fan of Cugino's!",

Then, when they ring you up, they have a calculator next to the cash register. Instead of ringing you up, they doodle the prices on the calculator.

I ordered an eggplant parmigiana sandwich macaroni salad and a cannoli ...the sandwich was possibly the best I've ever had perfect amount of sauce, usually I need extra but I didn't even have to use it ... It was very flavorful... And the bread was quality...and the sandwich stayed together wich is rare with a saucy sandwich ... Next was the macaroni salad ...

Prices are high for the junk food you serve--so bad. Your servers are rude, especially to women and children, kind of strange, maybe I need to be Vegas gorgeous with no kids, or servers think I won't tip? The place looks dirty! Really filthy.

I also called back less than 5 min later to switch part of the order and they would not let me because \"we already started making it\".   Food 3/5. The Food is alright. The only thing I loved was the bolognese sauce. Their marinara sauce is lacking flavor and tastes like it's made from tomato paste from a can. I definitely recommend the garlic knots over the garlic bread. The bread has these half melted slices of cheese on top of it and was gross. But their garlic knots are delicious-just make sure you like garlic because they are very garlicky! The chicken parm was alright, I've had better and once again I wasn't impressed with the marinara sauce on it.   Oh, and if you order take out or delivery, make sure to ask for a side of parmesan cheese because they don't give you any and you'll want some to add some flavor to the bland sauce.   I gave this place 3/5 because I still have hope the pizza and sandwiches will be as good as the bolognese sauce & garlic knots. This place has potential but they need to work on customer service.",

It's not because their school is typically rated in the top 50 for hottest studies bodies, or the fact the Strip is so accessible to them, but it's because they can go to places like Cugino's whenever they want!  This is that Italian deli, or any deli really, that you wish was right by your school or work.  It's about 2 miles from the Strip, so you can either take a brief drive down E. Tropicana Ave and turn down Maryland, or walk that way for about 40 minutes. It's obviously more authentic than options on the Strip, and better yet, at cheaper prices.  Once you enter it, you can tell it's locally-owned, as is has that mom and pop shop type look and feel. Check out some of the photos others posted, as you'll see it's not just a counter to order food at and chairs to sit on.  They have lots of foods on display packaged up that you can order or grab, like meats, salads, and breads.  I was afraid to look too closely as I would have spent way more than I planned.  For $9.99, I went with the basic spaghetti and meatballs with included 2 breadsticks and a sizable salad.   If you're visiting Vegas and have your own car, consider heading over here. If you're a student at UNLV and have a break during lunch, just walk on over here. Over, and over.",

It is set-up like how a director would imagine an Italian deli in New York would be. I have tried their sandwiches, salads, spaghetti, lasagna, pizza, and most importantly their garlic knots! I could eat their garlic knots everyday, they blow any other Italian place out of the water. DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT TRYING THEIR GARLIC KNOTS. I would reccommend everything I have tried here - nothing has been less than excellent.",

I have had meatball spaghetti in so many places and Cugino's is just so delicious that I am already addicted to it like crazyyyyy. The entree comes with a dish of fresh Salad and two italian bread sticks. The salad is always fresh and tasty and the bread is just unbelievably good.    Not gonna lie that I am not a picky person and I always give 5 stars review everywhere I go, but 100 some people give this place a 4 or 5 stars. You just can't go wrong with CUGINO!

Fast forward a few years and we pick up pizza there whenever we are nearby.

But for me it has always been hit and miss. The delivery combo(or whatever their supreme is) pizza was soggy and bland. Their spag and Italian sausage was really good but the Alfredo tasted closer to stuff I could get from a jar. It's at times really good and other times way over rated.  I wonder if the authentic feel over powers all other senses.",

    "text": "Cugino's Italian Deli UNLV Maryland Parkway, After school, my son likes following the university students to the Italian deli named Cugino's at the Running Rebel Plaza across Maryland Parkway from the UNLV Student Union. The students line up for thick slices of Sicilian cheese pizza, baked Ziti, Italian rice balls stuffed with ground beef, Reuben deli sandwiches, gnocchi potato dumplings, some stuffed with cheese, and round meatball sandwiches covered with melted cheese combined with red sauce. The place is popular. The chefs brought their recipes from New York City. The family styled menu items are all homemade. Every ingredient original from the garlic knots to the bread crumbs used for the chicken cheese parmigiana. The sandwiches are so large that I can only eat half. The second half goes home for dinner following lunch. Police know all the restaurant in town and they stop inside Cugin's for lunch, which is funny with irony since photographs on the wall pay homage to Sicilian gangsters Charlie Lucky Luciano, Tony Soprano next to a portrait of Robert DeNiro known for his Godfather fame. Two of the special house sandwiches are named Tony Soprano and the Godfather. Maps of Italy paint the wall above homemade cookies colorfully wrapped for holiday gifts. Pizza and chicken wing specials are made for large families enjoying football games and college students in the dorms watching sports. Buckets of chicken wings are delivered. Weekends, all the cars in the parking lot after final exams finished were diners at Cugino's Italian Deli. Sunday, instead of breakfast at a pancake house full of waffles, we waited until Cugino's opened at 10 AM for homemade linguine noodles with a little seafood spice, the red sauce was tangy over calamari, scallops, shrimp and grilled abalone served with cucumber and tomato salad with fresh bread rolls. There was a line of customers by 11 AM one hour later and two police officers on a lunch break. The tables were full. The servings large, our family brought bags of food home and ate the rest of the day: Seafood, mushrooms, salad, potatoes, olives, marinated vegetables. I ate the large bowl of Minestrone soup at the table. Varieties of hot soups with spinach, cabbage, rice, and boiled brown beans. I kept wondering how they made the broth since the taste was so original, \"Was it chicken broth or vegetable broth? Slow cooked?\" The soups taste was delicious. The chefs spoke of New York City, where my wife and I met, and the bakers took pride in their homemade dishes as we spoke of baked fresh lasagna, grilled vegetables marinated in herbs, oils and sauce with mushrooms, eggplant, red peppers, white cheese rolls, peppers stuffed with meat. As we spoke they were seasoning the fresh grilled garlic rolls in more garlic, cheese, olive oil and green herbs, I brought a quarter pound of every salad with vegetables home one afternoon to dine on with their garlic rolls. We spoke of the lite rail system the city plans on developing right in front of the restaurant from the airport to Cashman Center stopping right in front of the deli. This is the only deli full of quality in the entire community giving the neighborhood pride. Frozen groceries are served inside so that you can try and bake the pastas at home, especially the gnocchi, but my wife prefers to eat inside Cugino's because these professionals cannot be beat in a Sicilian kitchen. Coffee, hot chocolate, large cups of espresso, my children always ask for the hot chocolate served in large bowl shaped cups of creamy sweetness. Students relax with hot chocolate and sweet cannelloni after class to watch soccer on the large HD televisions in the corner.",

We ordered a delicious antipasto salad that was topped with incredibly tasty salami and cheese. This salad totally set the tone for the treat we were in for. Our pizza came out, and my group devoured it. The crust was perfection. It was sturdy, with the perfect chewy yet crispy crunchy texture. It reminded me of my favorite pizza from my childhood. The meats used are for sure above average. The pepperoni was super flavorful, and delicious.   We indulged in Cannolis, and a slice of their homemade bread pudding. Where to begin? The cannoli was by far the best cannoli I've ever tasted. I did not want it to end. The filling is made in house, and let me tell you- it's heavenly. I was tempted to order a couple more to take home.   The bread pudding was surprisingly scrumptious. We ordered it on a whim after hearing them talk about their Mom just made it. I'm not typically one for bread pudding, and I never think to order it. In fact, my friend was the one that added it the order. Boy, am I glad she did. We sat there and savored each bite. Any time they have the bread pudding on special... order it. Trust me. It's Devine.   I will be back, probably this weekend with my entire family. I want to share this spot with everyone. Such a great experience!",

    "text": "Ok... when their cheese pizza is everything you hope to taste in a pizza.... you know it's legit! This place is a mom and pop shop, with awesome dishes.   But let me talk about their cheese pizza... not the Sicilian style, but NY style...  They get it right!!! Thin crust, but the crust is CRISPY underneath all the delicious cheese! It seems that's hard for many Vegas pizzerias... maybe cuz I normally order meat lovers. But their pizza crust was perfectly toasted. Even the flipping Parmesan cheese made their slice fire!!! And the sauce was sweet. And a slice is $2.50. I've had the Sicilian slice, but I prefer NY style pizza all the way.   With that said, my husband loves the sandwiches. My daughter got some chicken soup and I could swear there is an Italian grandmother in the back who cooked that soup up!!!   My husband, who is a NY a native, describes this place as a \"gold mine.\"",

I think this place is genuinely Italian so I assumed their tiramisu would be awesome instead, it came to me not even completely thawed, still a little frozen and tasted disgusting.  I've been to Asian dessert places where their tiramisu is great which is what got me started on the hunt for a great piece of tiramisu.   I guess I'm just really bummed that the one thing I was looking forward to didn't meet my expectations even at the lowest level. :(",

Unlike the place in Austin, though, Cugino's is decidedly un-trendy.  It's in a strip shopping center near the UNLV campus.  And unlike other trendier options, Cugino's tends towards East Coast Italian-American dining as opposed to more \"authentic\" options.  I had a slice of their regular cheese pizza and a slice of their Sicilian thick crust.  Both were good, but the Sicilian stole the show, if for nothing else than the extra sauce.  It's a great option for a very quick lunch away from the tourist areas of Vegas -- and at a fair price.",

It was delicious, and so was the Pastrami that my wife got.   The feel is East Coast, and the food tastes like you want. Sauce, Roll, chicken was all the perfect sub. It was so good my son had to take one to go. UNLV should bring potential east coast students here to inspire their decision to come to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I was looking for something different during lunch and realized that the UNLV area was surprisingly close. Cue a visit to one of my older bookmarks in the area...  Cugino's Italian Deli is in one of those plazas across Maryland Parkway from UNLV. Despite its location, I saw few college-age customers in the dining area and none behind the counter. Even without the New York faux license plates and sports teams pennants on the wall, you could get some of the straightforward no-nonsense attitude from the employees.  You can also get pastas, sauces, deli meats, cheeses, and other Italian foodstuffs both packaged and fresh. I was more interests in the ready-made foods, which as you might expect include sandwiches, pizzas, and pastas.  I wasn't feeling up for a lunch special on my first visit (basically several normally priced items plus a free fountain drink) so I went with the eggplant parmesan sandwich ($9.99). It's not a super huge portion, but it has pretty decent bread, savory eggplant, delicious red sauce, and really gooey cheese. The banana pepper really went well with this sandwich too. It was probably a bit of a mistake to skip the meatballs though, and I wasn't getting that really deep satisfaction that I have from other sandwiches. I wouldn't say it was worth over ten minutes' wait.  I went back a couple of days later for that meatball parmesan sub ($8.99). I was hoping for a really mind-blowing meatball, but I got pretty good ones that are still unfortunately not the best that I've had out of a small Italian deli. Same cheese and red sauce didn't quite carry the day.  My favorite part about the second visit was the cannolis. They come both large ($3.75) and small ($1.75). After one bite, I felt regret at not getting the large one. Crispy crust, cold but not too sweet filling, and just enough chocolate. I would possibly come back for those. I haven't had a lot of cannolis, so this isn't saying too much, but they're the best I've had.  Cugino's is a decent lunch spot if you're in the area. I would give 3.5 stars in an ideal world (or an ideal rating system), but I was just was too underwhelmed in my two visits. I would come back to try some pizza or cold cut sandwiches if a friend invited me, but there are far superior hot sandwiches in town.",

The pasta was cooked to perfection and it was a HUGE bowl, it took me 2 days to finish it.  The cannoli was kinda tiny for 1.75 but it was totally worth it.

    "text": "This is one of my favorite pizza joints in Vegas! Perfect for the average college student, conveniently located across the street of UNLV with amazing (and decently priced!) food.   My two favorite things here are the cheese pizza and the ranch. The cheese pizza fulfills everything I want in a New York style pizza: pizza sauce perfectly seasoned, melted cheese that clings to the piece when you take a bite, and all on top of a thin crust with lots of grease (yes you read that right). The kind of pizza slice that you have to fold in half to eat.. That's my shit. As for the ranch, they charge 50 cents for a small side, but let me tell you, it's worth it. They put raw garlic in it, and I sure love me some garlic.   They have some pretty good specials too (my favorite go-to is the two slices of cheese pizza with a drink for $6.99) and their customer service is always super friendly.  I also gotta say I love the ambiance of this place, from the shelves stacked with Italian brands of pasta and tomato sauces to the walls covered with Italian or New York decor, and especially the family that runs the place.  I wouldn't recommend, however, the white sauce with pasta or the salad. The salad is bagged ice berg lettuce and bottled dressing. As for the white sauce, it tasted like a jar of Ragu alfredo sauce.  Just stick with the pizza, trust me on this.",

I truly believe that you should only buy pizza from an Italian. All in all, if you're looking for a pizza shop then check out Cugino's.

    "text": "Wow, another winning restaurant in Vegas, and as usual, it's not even on the Strip.  Seriously, the next time I return, I'm not even going to BOTHER with the Strip at all, because all the good stuff is on the outskirts.  Cugino's is such a place.    This is sort of a combination restaurant/pizza shop/Italian goods store - it reminds me a LOT of Trinacria at home (which most Baltimoreans adore).  There's a deli where you can get specialty meats and cheeses, pastas, and other goodness.  My husband and I came here to eat, though, and eat we did!  My husband got the Donnie sandwich, while I tried a pastrami melt.  Let me tell you, folks, that Donnie is something ELSE, okay?  The mozzarella, meat and vinegar combined into one huge taste explosion that I will quite probably remember for the rest of my days.  It was THAT good.  And the pastrami melt.... wow.  Huge, juicy, delicious.  I have never had any sandwich in my life that I liked more.    We ordered two cannolis for dessert and they went down perfectly with the meal.  Really, really good stuff.  Definitely rivals Trinacria here, my Baltimore friends, so you have GOT to come over to this place to eat when you visit Vegas.  If we lived here, this would be our go-to shop for Italian staples.  We didn't try the pizza, but we overheard our neighbors-in-food raving about it - something about how they haven't had decent New York pizza since they left New York but they finally found it here.    So now you KNOW it's good.  This is definitely worth a revisit when we come back to the area.  Don't miss this place.  The Yelp reviews are on target here.",

By recommendation, I ordered the Donnie's Special Sandwich (chicken cutlets, fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers, balsamic vinegar and oil, and some shredded lettuce and onions). It was absolutely amazing - the delicious chicken cutlet is homemade and the peppers and dressing add a vinegary mouthwatering twist making the sandwich much more Italian-like than I expected.  I also got a few appetizers wanting to try as many dishes as possible on my first and only visit considering I am from out of state. I got a little bowl of assorted olives as I figured you can't go wrong with them (and I was right, they're supreme saltiness was on point), some delectable fried zucchini (served with mozzarella sauce on the side, delicious), and a few garlic knots (also superb).   The aura of Cugino's was refreshing, casual, and authentic. The man who took my order was friendly and helpful with my inquisitions. He was rather surprised I was not from the area, making it seem as though most of the customers are locals, however, he was extremely welcoming and excited to serve us Cugino's delicacies.   There are a plethora of reasons why I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Cugino's; all in all I highly recommend this Italian restaurant to anyone looking for an authentic and memorable meal!!",

    "text": "\"A-OK\" -  That might be pushing it, as I was upset.    I ordered an $8.99 special - meatball sandwich and drink.  I asked how much for fries - was charged $1.99.  Order came to $13.something.  I asked why - and was told it was taxes. I asked to see the receipt and then was told it was also the credit card fee.  Whattttt - thank you for warning me.  She pointed to a sign on the table (buried with all the other hand written notes). I advised her that MasterCard/Vasa regulations prohibited charging a service fee on a debit card and you must have filed proper paperwork to let them know you will be charging a \"checkout fee\". She was not happy I was questioning them - so I asked \"do you feel it is right to charge so much - especially college students, as you are on a campus\" - she said \"everyone does it\" ... ummmm, no, most restaurants do not.  Claiming it cost them money - OK, I get that, but it is called \"SERVICE\"! Plus, you charged me OVER 10% fee ... you are charged - at most 3-3.5%?   Then she said \"why do you think I asked if you wanted to pay cash or card\" - I said \"so you knew which button to push on your register\", she said \"no, so you would figure out there was a fee for the card\".     You lost a new customer because of a stupid fee.  I hope you make enough off others, that you do not mind losing the ones you do for this.  Oh, and one more tip - to go orders, include a napkin please.  Thanks.  Oh - the 3 stars were because the meatball sandwich was OK - not the best - cut in half meatballs - but was tasty.",

It is owned and operated by an Italian family, I believe at least three generations.  They have some awesome specials that you'd expect to find at a pizza place, and there are also some outstanding Italian dishes. Inside you also find an Italian style deli and shop. This place reminds me of a bodega.   I often go in for the fresh, homemade mozzarella, canned DOP tomatoes, fresh made Italian breadcrumbs, and pasta imported from Italy. The deli has amazing desserts, like cheesecake, cannolis, wedding cookies and even icees. This place is very authentic, with better quality items than you'd find at the local grocer.   They even do delivery through one of those services; we watched the whole process while we were waiting on our own meal and they were really nice to the older delivery woman.   We've tried everything from the wings and pizza, pasta, and even a chicken parmesan sub. Everything is made fresh to order. Whether you are going for hot food or authentic groceries, I'd highly recommend Cugino's.",

You can get oil, noodles, sauce, and more here. I noticed in the case they had homemade sausages (I will be trying these eventually) and a variety of olives.

Both delicious, but I give my edge to the cheese bread. Good atmosphere and quick service combo'd with the food makes this a must while you're in Vegas.",

The frozen bread is well worth the four dollars - especially if you miss the bread from back East, because it's from back East!!! Heat it up and be ready to be gloriously stuffed with the best carbs around. And don't forget to top it off with fresh mozzarella or slices of Prosciutto. The family who owns it are Mets fans but that's alright, I can still love my Phillies and I won't hold it against them because the food is so damn good. I can always go in there for a good heckle and trip down East coast Italian American memory lane. They carry lots of Italian brand sauce and tomatoes, and of course - Wise chips!!! Lot's of awesome memorabilia on the walls and great energy.",

Small in size and curt in customer service it was with admitted indecision that our group approached the Cugino's counter and ordering on-the-fly a six-part meal emerged, the $66 meal presented in four courses with plenty of leftovers and mostly impressive results.  Undoubtedly a red sauce joint despite a multitude of housemade salads and sandwiches it was with fried pillows of ricotta gnocchi that the meal began and with each creamy morsel crispy on the exterior but virtually oilless I was immediately impressed - a trend continued in the tender rice ball buried in house-pulled mozzarella and tangy marinara.  Obviously prone to over-ordering, particularly in small groups, our trio next doubled down on a pair of pies and while the thin white pie proved somewhat bland to my tastes with a mundane crust tinged with semolina the Sicilian dazzled as fresh mozzarella formed soft puddles amidst aromatic tomato sauce bright with acid and appropriately devoid of sugar.  Breezing through a plate of golden garlic knots aggressively seasoned with its namesake herb and kissed with butter before finishing the meal with pre-filled canolli already experiencing some sog it was with a bit of disappointment that I was informed neither house-made rainbow cookies nor tiramisu were available outside the freezer but with stomachs full and leftovers boxed as conversation flowed it would be hard to say I regretted much...except perhaps neglecting the tripe soup or eponymous Cugino's Special sandwich, both on the short 'there's always next time' list, though a repeat trek to similar-but-better Montesano's will most certainly come first.",

    "text": "Been going to Cugino's since 2004 and after all this time it is still my favorite Italian place in Vegas. A lot of people come here for their pizzas and pastas, which are all good. But what really puts this place over the top for me is their sandwiches. Any of their parmigianas are excellent. Do yourself a favor and get Donnie's Special sometime. In fact, almost anything they put in between bread is worth trying.   My top 5 sandwiches: 1. Donnie's Special 2. Philly Cheese Steak 3. Sausage, Peppers, and Eggs 4. Cugino's Special 5. Meatball Parmigiana  They also have a section next to the checkout counter where they sell quality stuff such as roast peppers, marinated mushrooms, marinated eggplant, grilled vegetables, sausage, and stromboli. They're all blackout good. Don't forget to try their garlic knots, seasoned fries, and Sicilian rice balls, all of which are also made in-house. They also have incredibly tasty sweets like cannolis and cheesecake, both of which rank among the best I've ever tried.   You'll need countless trips to this place just to try everything they have to offer, and chances are you won't anytime soon because you'll probably end up buying some of the same things over and over again. Vegas is very lucky to have a great deli such as this and I hope they'll stick around for many years to come.",

Large meat sauce would be called size small everywhere else and barely any meat in it. Rice ball parmingiana was the only thing I was able to eat as I dumped the rest. I didn't enjoy it really, it was more of a I paid $40 and am hungry thing. The sauce isn't that good so it killed the rest. was too mushy couldn't tell it was a rice ball really more of a mush ball.

Yeah the crust is thin, but it's almost got a cracker feel to it.  Better than Secret Pizza in the Cosmo.  Ingredient quality and freshness unquestionable.  I also ordered the garlic knot (nothing special), cheese arancini (nice to try, won't order again), and the fried ravioli (yes!).  I think I'll be coming back to try the pasta or a sandwich.

When I opened the M.Sticks they appeared to be your garden variety frozen cheese sticks. I tasted them and confirmed there was nothing special here. The marinara sauce was tasty and really salvaged the cheese sticks for me.  Next I opened the Fettuccine Alfredo the portion was huge and it looked good but when I tasted it it had little or no flavor. It was like eating a frozen dinner. Fettuccine Alfredo is one of my guilty pleasures but this was not worth the calories.  Sorry I will not be going back here.",

I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the clam pizza.  I recommend the white sauce.  Also tried the standard cheese slices and they were great as well.  They also have a large selection of Italian deli products to go and a full menu of sandwiches.",

    "text": "Wow! wait wait wait.....Wow! Entering the dining room its kind of just what you expect in a strip mall across the street from your local college. Its really a no non sense straight forward deli, order at the counter that has a few tasty items to look over inside of it, racks of some of the authentic product (and some not so authentic) that is used by the joint to create your tasty grub, and an old tube tv in the corner with the Italian soccer league playing for the fans (i am) of the soccer as well as the spot. I met a friend here for lunch this time visiting and ordered two sandwiches a meatball parm and a pastrami that both came with drinks for the price of $6.99 (meatball) and 7.99 (pastrami). Both came out within 5 minutes and good god i was surprised how much meat was on the pastrami sandwich. We traded halves so we can enjoy both and ill start with the meatball and just say this bread is heavenly soft and tasty, with a gravy that i honestly could put in a cup and drink its so tasty. The meatballs were straight forward, i didnt take any special blend of spices or savory flavor additionally as even if there was it was going to be masked by the lovely sauce and bread combo i was thoroughly enjoying topped off with generous servings motz cheese. The pastrami was served on a marble rye as it should be and as you can see from the other pictures provided is at least 1.5\" thick with just meat and its very juicy and flavorful. Deli mustard, onions and again generous portions of melted cheese round out this well crafted sandwich. The service is straight forward and welcoming, almost like a family ran atmosphere and the food is served quick, hot and good so that i have experienced. Best advice my review can offer you is TRY IT, and enjoy the tasty goodness of Cugino's.",

In Vegas for a while and I went yesterday and ordered the the small white clam pizza to go and it was soooooo good! Just finished the last slice now for lunch and I want more! Heading back this evening to order  the large!  I also tried the garlic knots and it was really nice, and filling, cant beat $2.99 for 6 of them. Friendly atmosphere, and I was even offered a garlic knot while I waited, great service!  I have had pizza from the reg pizza spots and I have had Cugino's! Clear difference!",

The food is just as good as other Italian restaurants but its not as pricey. Today I had the meat ball parm sub and let me tell you, it's one of the best subs I've ever had! I'm all for small family owned restaurants and this place is one of the reasons why. It can look a little sketchy at first but I like to keep an open mind. Give this place a shot. The food is delicious and made to order and no, it doesn't take forever.",

I also love their deli counter, and mini market with imported food from Italy. The whole staff seems like they are straight from New York, with their accent and all. It is a favorite in my book!! Just wish they had Italian Desserts. I didn't see any on the menu or behind the counter.",

This is a small family run deli and from what I know from talking with the folks that run it, they are making just about everything from scratch. As I mentioned, I have had every specialty sandwich and while I like most very much, the Donnie Special might be my favorite (by a small margin).  I would also recommend anything they serve with their marinara sauce, it is delicious and has a fresh bright taste.  The mozzarella cheese is made in house and better than any high end mozzarella that I have every bought or tasted.  I love coming here for lunch and of course no meal is every complete without a delicious, filled to order canoli.",
