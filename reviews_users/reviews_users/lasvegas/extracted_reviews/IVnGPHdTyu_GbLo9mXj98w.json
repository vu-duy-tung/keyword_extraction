Granted I shouldn't be eating so late in the first place to anger my stupid acid reflux, but as an industry person in Las Vegas, you sometimes just want late night ramen after a stressful shift. Am I right or am I right??        Now back to business..., LOVE this place!! Hands down the most beautifully flavored Tonkatsu broth in town in my humble opinion. That along with the fantastic service by the friendly wait staff makes it just that more perfect. For you gym rats on a carb loading day, have a small bowl of their curry rice with your ramen bowl and you..are...set!! Oh and the Chasu pork on that ramen? Packs a delicious delicate flavor that's truly accentuated by that amazing broth.  I could eat ramen everyday and I might have just found my new obsession...",

    "text": "Ramen cravings in Vegas are never fully satisfied. Most of the ramen shops are comparable to one another - and by that, I mean either average or below average. The broths just don't cut it and the ingredients are always lacking. We tried Tatsu as an alternative to the jam-packed Sora and Monta and the results were about the same, except without the excessive wait times. The shoyu broth was nothing more than a glorified soy sauce base. The noodles and egg were decent enough, but the cuts of charsiu and lack of anything else was a let down. However, I would argue that there are a couple of benefits of getting your ramen fix at Tatsu. First, the ramen comes out pretty quick (almost too quick, which might explain some of the lacklusterness). Second, checking in on Yelp nets you a free soda. So, there you have it.",

He said it was a close second to the ramen he had in Tokyo!  Not only was the food great, the service was even better.  They were so super sweet to us and didn't rush us out when we were clearly finished eating.  If you are looking for a ramen spot in Chinatown - check out Ramen Tatsu!",

If you cook and reduce the broth with the bones you would get more flavor, but it seems like they've just added more salt..  The noodles were broken and too hard. Tsukemen noodles should be soft, chewy and long. With the thickness of the broth and the texture of the noodles, the broth should really stick unto the noodle when consuming.  If you're ever in LA, go to Tsujita Annex and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.   Just go with the miso ramen at this spot.. Or just go to LA.. Haha   Not one star because their Asahi was super refreshing :)",

I got the tonkatsu spicy after the waitress told me this was her favorite and that they use habanero to make this dish spicy.  I was a bit turned off by the thin noodles that came as a default when I first saw the dish, but after eating a bit I was very impressed by the soup broth and the cha-su, which made the thin noodles a moot point.  I was only depressed by the egg, but after going to Monta a few hours later, it seems like the shops in LV don't know how to flavor the egg.  Anyways, I will be coming back for more.  I had Monta right afterwards and to be honest I think Ramen Tatsu might be better!!!",

I'm a mess when I eat and usually end up with a couple spots of broth from the soup on some part of my shirt. My visit to Ramen Tatsu was no different. No matter how careful I am, I end up wearing some of my lunch. It was worth it, though, to try their tonkotsu ramen ($7.77). While it wasn't as creamy as I'd like -- the broth was thinner and more diluted -- the pork flavor was hearty. I'm not a fan of the really thin noodles, which were too al dente, but the tender pork with its rendered fat made up for it. The slivers of fat provided an excellent burst of flavor with each bite. Located in the same plaza as District One and Chada Thai, it can be tough to find parking during peak hours.",

Service: (4 star) never nothing special but food came out quickly.  Tonkatsu shoyu ramen: (3.5 stars) above average but nothing special. Came with 2 pieces of chasu.  -Added a soft boiled egg to my ramen. Doesn't come with one but you can add it for a small extra fee.  Kaarage: (4.5 stars) crispy and fried well. Thought this was probably my favorite dish during the meal.  Deluxe (3.5 stars): this was the same as the tonkatsu shoyu but come with more chasu and an egg as well as the other condiments.   Would probably come here again but didn't blow me away.",

I got the kimchi as an appetizer and woooo was it super tangy! I got the veggie ramen and it was so good!! The broth was so good I barely added anything too it (just some chili oil lol). More importantly my son loved it! He loved the egg rolls and he even ate the kimchi! But he loved the noodles and the broth! I even took leftovers of the ramen and he ate it later that night! The only thing that sucked was it is cash only right now so either call ahead to double check or bring cash. Would definitely come back! And I love that they have veggie options!",

My main complaint is that every time I've been there, the add-ins are cold. For Pete's sake, but the extra egg in the broth so I don't have to warm it up! Now, if I ordered straight off the menu and didn't add anything, I would not have been the wiser and given 5 stars. It's THAT good! However, I don't think hot food is too much to ask for. My buddy John swears that this is the best ramen in town, but I can't abide the cold stuff on the side. Sorry, buddy. That being said, the curry ramen is pretty special. You should go for that alone. I LOVE that they are open until 11pm, as I get off work sometimes at 9:30 or 10 and can still grab a bite. They don't look at you funny for coming in late either. Parking is easy, they usually have something interesting on TV and the staff is very nice. There is this weird music thing where you hear songs you know, but not by the people you know. I find that odd.",

We ordered the Miso Ramen, Spicy Miso Ramen, and Deluxe Ramen. The broth wasn't salty and was very tasty (we all finished eating the broth it was so good), the pork was delicious and almost melted in your mouth, and the staff is very friendly and made us feel welcomed!

Depending on what you order, your ramen will come with different toppings. I like the miso ramen because it has corn on it, which not a common thing to find in ramen at other restaurants. If you have the taste buds for extremely spicy foods, my family loves the EXTRA spicy miso ramen. My family likes to compete to see who can handle it the best :P They also have the Chashu Rice Bowls or Fried Rice that is really tasty and good for anyone who doesn't feel like eating ramen.  The staff is friendly, food comes out quick, food is good, and the setting is cute.",

    "text": "Oddly enough, the husband and I were craving ramen on a hot, humid day in Vegas. We usually go to Ramen Sora, but decided to check out a different place this time around. Decided on Ramen Tatsu over Hiromaru, since \"fusion ramen\" sounded too weird and complicated. They are located right across the street from 168 Market. I don't like this plaza at all. It feels too crowded and the parking is retarded. Hard to explain, but you will know what I'm talking about when you go there.   They were pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon, but we were able to get seated right away. Our server was polite and friendly. I felt that she handled servicing all the customers very well by herself, including the couple sitting next to us. They were flagging her down for every little thing and asking a lot of questions (yeah, they were one of those). I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and a mini curry bowl. The broth for the Shoyu Ramen had a good flavor, not too rich but also not bland. I felt that there were a good amount of noodles. The curry was great! NO VEGGIES, and I believe the meat they used in it was pork. Definitely my kind of curry! It wasn't watery and tasted very good. I'm not sure who the owners are, but this place looks and feels like an authentic Japanese restaurant. My husband liked it as well, despite being located in  a kind of run down plaza. Small price to pay for good food I guess.  I strongly believe Ramen Tatsu deserves a much higher rating!! They have excellent ramen and curry, so I will definitely be back soon!",

My second choice is Misoya Tomi for very unique and tasty miso ramens and third will be Yagyu (really at home taste for most Japanese, just make sure you order the noodle firm so they don't over cook).",

They deserve way better rating than 3.5 - thus 5 stars to help bump up the rating.  To me, Tatsu comes close to Monta, Sora and Fukumimi (and Shoku, for that matter), if not better. And so far, tsukemen (with authentic, special thick noodle!) is only available at Tatsu (except Hiromaru but don't count).  If you haven't, try the deluxe ramen - it's a tasting menu for their ramen. Also, fried rice and gyoza are pretty good too.  If you tried a long ago before the ownership fuss, give them a second chance.  My wife has more unforgiving tastes than myself (looking at you, Guy Savoy), but she approves Tatsu too. Consider this review two votes.  We want good restaurants to stay.",

Their seared Chashu is the BEST thing ever along with their katsu curry bowl! Their spicy miso is absolutely to die for as well, considering they use habanero, it is spicier than most spicy ramens in town, but tastes better than them all. I can't speak highly enough about them and i have tried almost every ramen spot in town now. I still don't know how Monta has the reputation it has when this place poops all over them.",

His chashu is unbelievable. Braised and seared, it's a must try. The gyoza are mini size, but pack a wallop of flavor. Karaage chicken come out in huge pieces, very moist with a great crunch.  His cold ramen with dipping sauces is fantastic, especially the sesame dipping sauce. And it's presented exquisitely.  Asahi on draft is a huge plus! Expect gracious hospitality, and amazing service.  This is now on my \"must list\" each time I visit Vegas!",

I ordered a spicy ramen w/ goyza , which I have to say was perfectly cooked ! Nobody ever cooks the goyza right but this place hands down is the best & you get to make your own goyza sauce which is entertaining as you wait for your food . The pricing is fair and not so expensive ! I should have went during their happy hour. But seriously I wish I could of left a bigger tip . Great place & excellent food ! Great service !",

    "text": "So, I was a bit depressed that Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is not open on Sunday.  After filling up the gullet at HK Star on Mothers Day, I wanted to get some tonkatsu for the mother in laws to have at her place for dinner.  So I was calling in an order and realized that they were closed on Sundays.  As I was planning to pick up some to go items from Asian BBQ and Noodles, I saw that Ramen Tatsu sign advertising tonkatsu so I decided to give this place a shot:  a.  Where is everyone?  On a prime mothers day Sunday at lunch, the place had, three people.    b.  Take out - I was ordering take out, so I decided to forego any noodles and went for tonkatsu, tonkatsu with curry and an order of fried rice.  - Fried Rice - Very tasty, a nice firm consistency with great taste and plenty of small bits of meat.  I enjoyed this very much.  Not sure what was all in it as I just ate it all .  Yeah, I did give some to the mother in law, but took some home too.....  - Tonkatsu with Curry - Since this was take away, the tonkatsu was packed separately of the curry.  The tonkatsu was decent, no real wow factor for me, yet it was very edible.  Just not memorable.  the curry is pretty tasty. I like the dark color and the richness of the curry.  There was no veggies in it like carrots or potatoes to give the curry a bit of flavor and excitement.  It was just curry.  The food as I said was decent, just not anything memorable. The packaging of the take out was good, separating the curry from everything, but the presentation inside the boxes were a bit minimal.  In fact, if anything, the servings were a bit on the small side.  The service is five star!  The waitress was very pleasant and gave me a glass of water while I waited.   I definitely will be coming back soon to try their ramen and other dishes. I like the fact that it is not too busy but I am bit concerned that they are not too busy either.  GK says try this place out, it is authentic and dry nice.  I just have to try a bit more of the food to tie this a 4 star or more...",

The service was fantastic. She made sure to clear empty plates but not come around so much that she imposed. She was very polite and always made sure our drinks were filled.   We visited 430 on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised to hear it was still happy hour. Some apps and asahi for $3 each, cant beat that. I like how on the menu they describe the broth very well.  Shoyu ramen: the broth was well balanced and it wasn't too salty, but still had a light soy sauce flavor. This ramen comes with an egg which was a plus.  Tonkatsu shoyu ramen: basically a milkier version of the shoyu ramen. You can tell they really cooked it with bones so the flavors really come out.   Takoyaki: a good balance of sauce on top. Usually I burn my tongue on this but it was nice that for once it was served at a temp that didn't hurt.  Small curry rice: served with a side of picked radishes. 'Nuff said. ----but on a real note, I was pretty stoked because I was craving curry and it was at the same standard if you went to just a Japanese curry place.  Gyoza: pretty standard but it felt like there was more than what restaurants usually serve.  All this plus an Asahi for $30. Not too shabby. I'll be back Ramen Tatsu.",

    "text": "Came here a few nights ago since we knew Jinya and Monta had long wait times. This place surprisingly had long wait times too (my boyfriend and I waited around 40 minutes here) but we thought we should try somewhere new instead of our usual ramen spots.  My biggest gripe is that this place does not like to do any accommodations for customers. When we sat down , we wanted to order tonkastu ramen but the waitress told us they have been out of it which was kinda inconvenient , they should have put a sign on their door that said they're out of it since it's a popular menu choice & we waited so long to get tonkatsu ramen in mind. I asked the waitress if I can switch out the tonkatsu broth w/ miso broth instead and she said no but I can order their miso ramen. My issue w/ ordering their miso ramen is that it has corn and bean sprouts in it which makes the broth taste terrible (mainly just the bean sprouts w/ my experience at Fukumimi) & I just cared about getting pork, mushrooms and broth I like for my ramen. I asked if it's possible to switch out the corn and bean sprouts for different toppings. At first the waitress said no they can't do that but she can just remove those two toppings (and I will still be paying same price). She also suggested that I could order the shio or shoyu ramen since those don't have corn or bean sprouts in it like the miso ramen. However , I prefer heavier broths like tonkatsu or miso. I showed her on their menu the toppings I wanted to be substituted is pretty much almost the same price as corn and bean sprouts so she finally she agreed to doing my order after I asked and mentioned that twice.  Food came out quick which was the only good thing for waiting so long. All the toppings were really cold. I tried some of my boyfriend's shoyu which didn't taste good at all , thankfully their miso wasn't bad. So glad I didn't go w/ waitress' recommendation to order shoyu. Other ramen places have chili paste or spice seasonings on the table available but this place charges you extra.",

The food came out pretty quick like a typical ramen shop. Not quite a open kitchen either like most ramen shops.   I ordered the tonkatsu shoyu ramen, the flavor was pretty good not as rich broth as I have had at other places. My only problem was their food was on the salty side. If it was lighter it would have been better and I would have rated them higher, also the noodles were also to Al dente for my taste. I felt the noodles should have been softer, need a few more minutes of cooking time. The pork slices on top of the noodles also was a bit salty. I also ordered a pork belly rice bowl but that too was salty.  It was decent but due to the improperly cooked noodles and saltyness not my favorite.",

    "text": "They are located next to District One. Plenty of parking space around.   I went here couple of times and still did not like it.   I decided to try their Tsukemen (soup on the side). Price is reasonable $10.70.   It came with a flat thick yellow noodle. I thought the noodle was hard to chew and tasteless. The brooth was thick which was expected for Tsukemen, but it was way too salty and has a weird after taste (as if it was re-cooked many times). The charsu was okay, it was cold and taste can improved. It did not come with bamboo shoot or mushroom but it did come with boiled egg.   Service was great, however. It was fast and timely.  I also had the macaroon ice cream (not pictured). That's the best part of my lunch. I enjoyed it more than my ramen.   I saw they have Happy Hour menu with great prices. So if I decided to come back, I would try their HH menu instead.",

I agree with the other reviewers in that the ramen here isn't overly salty as is typical of ramen restaurants, which is wonderful.   What's also cool is that you have the option to tailor not just the toppings but also the spiciness level of your ramen to your taste. Would definitely recommend on your trip to Vegas!",

I went across the street to 168 Market and got my mochi fix there, for a lot cheaper.",

    "text": "So this is my favorite ramen place in vegas. A lot of people say that sora or monta is better but I can't really compare them (since, I never ate there). However, I don't ever want to put in the effort to go to sora or monta because the wait is aways super long. When, I can just go to Ramen Tatsu, for what I think is the BEST ramen place.   Not only do they have excellent ramen that taste amazing and balanced but they have curry, that tastes like its from the gods. They even have a ramen that mixes the curry with shoyu and it tastes so good. My dad says that the taste reminds him of when he was in Japan. The taste is very authentic and they are always so fast.   The ambience of the place is wonderful because it really is like you are in a ramen shop in japan. It's small but by far my favorite place to get ramen, curry, and takoyaki.",

I have a bit of a ramen addiction and if you do too this is a great place to satisfy your cravings!! I get the tonkotsu which comes with thin noodles. The broth is made from pork bone marrow and veggies boiled for many hours! It's absolutely delicious! I get no meat so they add more mushrooms for me! And if you like spicy get the spicy sauce on the side! I highly recommend to everyone!",

    "text": "Saw the signage for a new ramen restaurant that was going to be opening soon while picking up dinner next door.  Fast forward about a month and I saw a few reviews from fellow Yelpers and most were just so so.  In spite of that, I still wanted to try it.  What can I say, I am a sucker for checking out new Japanese restaurants. So I asked Leos to go with me on Monday.  Unfortunately they are closed on Mondays.  So we went to a new Vietnamese pho restaurant instead.  [Visit 1] So after waiting another 22 hours, I went back to try my luck at Ramen Tatsu (on their official grand opening day) after clocking out at work for the day.  The restaurant had 2-3 parties already when I arrived, but soon after placing my order for a Tatsu Ramen Deluxe I realized I was alone in the restaurant with just the staff.  Nervously I noticed that I was feeling oddly warm, as if I was still outside in the 111 degree heat wave, but it turned out to just be a weak AC unit.  The Tatsu Ramen Deluxe - Tonkotsu + Shoyu based ramen with 6 pieces of Chasiu and vegetables, seaweed, 1/2 egg.  The presentation makes it look bigger than it really is, reminiscent of the Frilled Lizard (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-ocXifB-lZLI%2FTuBV8QyQ3fI%2FAAAAAAAADfY%2F3h3LfMfHrFo%2Fs1600%2FFrilled-Lizard-03.jpg&s=ce138b8df88101993ae59dfc80341837d3731d85f12c37ba7b0be53e8c9d0cf3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.bp.blogspot.com/-ocXif...</a>)  The broth was decent, the noodles was cooked well.  [Latest Visit from yesterday] I ate already before making an unscheduled stop at Ramen Tatsu.  So I only ordered their Chasiu Rice Bowl. Which is just a basic bowl of steamed rice with pieces of chasiu, green onions and a tiny bit of sauce on it.  It tasted fine, albeit a little dry with all the rice and very little sauce.  But was difficult to eat without potentially dropping pieces of chasiu on the table.  I tried the broth from the Tonkotsu Ramen and Shoyu Ramen that my dining companions ordered.  The Tonkotsu broth has definitely improved, and was definitely way better than any of the ramen I tried at the recent Ramen Festival at the Rio.  The portion for the ramen is what I considered smallish.  But the extra $1.50 for \"noodle refills\" is a great relative value.  Other observations:  * I asked for the Tsukemen, but it is no longer on the menu. * The restaurant is typically pretty empty, great if you don't like to wait for ramen, which is supposed to be fast food.  * Split check request is handled without any fuss. Definite plus.  Decor:  Nice and simple.  During holidays, they will have seasonally decorations,at least they have put up Halloween theme decorations right now.  Cleanliness: Very clean  Service: Friendly and thoughtful  Probability of return visits: Moderately high  More than a plain 3 stars, but not quite to 4 stars yet.",

The taste reminded me of childhood memories but I was quite disappointed that there were no potatoes, carrots or anything in the curry itself. Not even a piece of chicken. It could have been much better.   Outside of the restaurant, parking absolutely sucks. It is in a location with tons of restaurants and shops and it's hard to find parking during peak hours.

Pretty thick and flavorful broth and the noodles were nice and firm. The Chasu slices had a good amount of balance between fat and meat and once you placed it in the broth it instantly became a melt in your mouth texture.  The soft boiled egg was a little overdone but I'll forgive Ramen Tatsu just because it still tasted good.   Overall, a great experience at Ramen Tatsu and the closest I can get to True Tsukemen.",

Our table of three split an order of chicken karaage, three ramen bowls with some extra toppings (I got miso ramen), and a chashu rice bowl, and the bill came out to $14 a person (which simply does not happen in San Francisco where I'm from). The ramen was tasty, especially the two thick and fatty, cathartic chashu pieces in it, and the chashu bowl was elegant and delicious too.   Basically, the food was on point, the interior is cute, and our server was like something from an anime. She even greets people in Japanese as they leave / enter. Can't be beat. !",

When there's a wide selection like this, I find usually there is a loss in quality - as if having only two or three bowls like other ramen spots allows them to output great flavor in a speedy service. At Tatsu, you get the complete package: quick service and high quality flavor in each bowl; each distinct and unique from the next.   By now, I've tried them all (they now also have customizable options for additional ingredients). Over the months that I've been coming in here, I've noticed I'm not the only one that prefers Tatsu.  Business is doing well - more tables have been set in place, two flat screens were installed, and the menu has expanded.   This summer, they introduced Cold Ramen - a different delicious take on ramen for a hot day - and also Tsukemen which has thicker noodles with a dipping sauce of a hint of fish flavor.  I keep coming back because it's the best and the entire menu is top notch. I wouldn't be surprised if this hidden gem gets more and more popular in the near future.",

Super casual spot, very reasonably priced (I had the deluxe for $11 USD, wife had the tonkatsu for $8). Asahi and Sapporo on tap. Takoyaki was LEGIT (light and crispy on the outside, inside moist and fluffy, with very flavourful octopus stuffing. Droooooooool.",

If I can just find and review ramen restaurants that serves tsukemen all day every day, that would be awesome.  The service was quick and we were seated right away at the bar. The waitress explained the levels of spiciness to us since we were intrigued. My husband ordered a spicy tsukemen while I ordered it in a mild spiciness. The original basic tsukemen is not spicy at all.  Mild was actually spicier than I thought but still good. However, right away, I noticed the noodles aren't like your usual tsukemen noodle. They just seemed like regular cold cooked ramen noodle? I'm used to the tsukemen noodles being incredibly chewy and chunkier. The tsukemen came with two slices of pork, a seaweed and two soft boiled eggs. No frills and bells and whistles here.   The broth was good, but much saltier than I anticipated. I did enjoy the flavor, but was overwhelmed by how salty it was. I know that tsukemen broth is supposed to be very rich but I was definitely saltier than I usually like. Nonetheless, this place did help satisfy the tsukemen itch we had been having.",

We went to one of  my favorite ramen spots. In my opinion this is some of the best Ramen you can find here in Las Vegas. This hidden gem is a small shop nestled between two other shops.   We were greeted by a smile by the super friendly server we were used to seeing. \"Sit anywhere you'd like\" she said with a BIG smile.   We sat at a table where she promptly took our drink orders. We ordered the spicy miso ramen, miso ramen, a large fried rice minus the pork, and a house salad.   As always, the food did not disappoint. If I could buy a bottle of the dressing they use on their house salad I would. The spicy miso ramen had my co worker sweating it out while I enjoyed my pork free fried rice and salad. Everything was so full of flavor.   The service here is always perfect. Lots of smiles, very attentive, and the food is always served quickly.   I highly recommend this ramen shop.",

I love that this place is still not super popular so there's never really a wait. The ramen here is also very well priced.   The tonkatsu ramen had a creamy rich broth. It comes with thin noodles which I like but you can choose your noodle option. The noodles were soft but still had a good bite to it. The ramen comes with woodear mushrooms, charsu pork slices, which melted in your mouth, and green onions. I didn't care for the mushroom. It was super crunchy and flavorless. I would have rather had bean sprouts or bamboo shoots. My friend got the spicy tonkatsu ramen. The soup definitely had a kick. I liked the flavor better but eating the whole bowl would have been a little spicy for me.   My other friend ordered the spicy miso ramen. The miso flavor is potent in a good way. The next time I go back I'll order that.",

I took like 9 bites and just couldn't eat anymore because I disliked it so much.  I got the tonkotsu shoyo.   Just something about the broth tasted so bad to me.  Like something in my brain telling me that I shouldn't be eating it.   But every other review seems to think it's fantastic.  The meat in it was okay.   And I'm sure their noodles are prepared correctly but they were too hard for my taste.    Price was reasonable at $7.77 but my mouth is in a state of morning.    My wife is Asian and she liked what she got.   Maybe my whiteness stops me from enjoying Japanese Ramen.     Atmosphere is cute, intimate and quiet but won't be back.",

My mom and I came in today around noon. It's a small restaurant and I recommend coming in early.    We waited a couple minutes and were seated. There was only one server but I have to say, she was very lively and attentive. We ordered and it only took a few minutes to get our food.   We ordered Chasiu Bowl from the regular menu and Tonkatsu Shoyu medium spicy from the Special menu.  Tonkotsu Shoyu is spicy and had sliced pork in a delicious rich, flavorful and slightly creamy broth. . The noodles itself were delicious -- perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of chew.  My mom enjoyed the rice bowl, Chasiu Bowl. It has tender ground pork, seaweeds and rice.  The portion looked small but in the end we had leftovers! The price is so reasonable, cost like $15 for two dishes. I can't wait to go back.",

It's small spot but not a hole in the wall like Monta.The minute we came in the waitress greeted us and sat us down. She gave us the menu, took our drink and appetizer order and came out less than than a minute later. Yup, that was quick. She was pleasant, friendly and smiled throughout the whole service plus explained the menu to us which is a plus.   We ordered gyoza, chasu ramen, seared chasu plate with kimchee and fried rice and the Katsu curry plate.  All portions were perfect. Not too small nor too big. I had the katsu curry plate and it was delish! It was just as good as Zen's curry ( my favorite Japanese curry spot). The curry was pleasantly spicy but not too much.   After eating, my party stayed a but longer just to chat it up and the awesome part was that no one rushed us to get up and refilled our drinks at least two times even when the restaurant started to get overly packed. If it weren't for that, I would've given this place four stars. I like this place a lot and will be back soon to try their ramen.",

The gyoza tasted just like Monta. The Shoyu ramen was another winner. Although I prefer the Pork chasu at Monta, Ramen Tatsu presented a thicker cut of chasu that was also full of good flavor, just slightly different from Monta.  They also have a few dessert items like NY cheesecake, mango cheesecake, ice cream and Mochi ice cream.   Friendly and prompt service from Emy made the meal a pleasant and relaxing experience. No hurrying to finish my meal to make room for waiting customers. The size of the restaurant was slightly bigger than Monta. Give this place a try, it would be worth your time.",

I'm all about great service, this little Japanese lady who worked there always greeted you with the cutest smile and attentive service.  I can't count how many times I was having a really bad day, but her positive attitude always influenced me, not to mention they are super easy going when it comes to customize the soup.  I can tell them I want my soup less salty, and she'll say \"ok no problem\", had it been another ramen restaurant (whose name start with \"Sxxa\" or \"Mxxxxa\"), they will give me a funny look as if I'm trying to make their job difficult.  Their ramen are super yummy too (probably because I customize the soup exactly the way I wanted), NOT once I had a bad service from here.  Some of my favorites are Karaage (fried chicken), Shio and Miso Ramen, today I just tried their spicy pork ramen, watch out on that one, they are not joking about \"spicy\" part, but it's soooo good :)  Thank you for the awesome service Ramen Tatsu!",

I found this place with the help of some yelpers. I decided I can't go wrong with a place that offers ramen and appetizers.  I ordered: - Takoyaki - Tonkatsu - 1 Soyu Ramen (garlic chips and extra chasiu) - 1 Tonkatsu Ramen (extra chasiu and corn) - 3 Calpico drinks - 1 Sprite total about $40  Since i've only tried Monta and (my moms ramen), I'll be comparing the two (mom already wins).   I LOVE takoyaki and this place makes it so good, it's crisp on the outside and nice and creamy on the inside. The tonkatsu made with a cabbage salad and the tonkatsu sauce on the side, which was cooked to perfection. The tonkatsu was thick and crispy on the outside with the tender juicy pork on the inside. It was delicious.  When the ramen arrived the noodles were perfect, the soup was super flavorful and didn't need to add additional salt or soy sauce to it. Compared to monta's chasiu, this one is meaty in the middle and melt in your mouth on the sides (which is how it's suppose to be). I didn't enjoy the chasiu at Monta because it was like eating boiled fat (it was slippery, melty, and gooey).   If you want incredible ramen, come here. The waitress was super friendly and helpful. This small ramen restaurant should be deemed the best. The best thing is, it didn't make my love sick, he got so sick at Monta, he was scared to try Ramen again.",

    "text": "Our new go to ramen spot here in Vegas and we've been to them all. Not to say that others are junk but this one is now our favorite. It's a little small, but all the best places are.    We are what's scientifically known as fatasses and you'll soon see why.  Keep in mind, the following was only for me and my 5 foot girlfriend. We started with the gyoza and it was seriously good. My gf ate almost all of them and she usually only eats one or two pieces. Then we had an egg with ground pork bowl, which was also very tasty, kinda like shin sen gumi in LA. We also got the small curry bowl (because I love curry) and it was on point! I would come here for just the curry, even though I would have to order a ramen just because my stomach is built that way.   Those were just the appetizers. Which we demolished. Then we got our ramen. I believe she had the shoyu ramen which I didn't really get to taste, well, because she ate it all. I got the tonkatsu shoyu ramen. I really liked it because usually the tonkatsu broths are a little on the heavy side but this one was flavorful and light. I would like to say we took some home, but no. We finished everything.   So anyways, we got dessert. Not just a little. We didn't save room for it at all, we just kinda stuffed it in there. We got the Vanilla mochi ice cream. This was only ok. My gf didn't like the skin because it was kind of hard. But we got the mango cheesecake and that was good! It was super creamy. So creamy in fact in inspired me to get the New York style as well. This one was eh.. Only ok too. It was hard and not as creamy. Or maybe it was too cold, probably because we got it after they already closed.   This is definitely the spot to go if you're craving a ramen fix.",

The place was half empty and we still waited with empty drink glasses on multiple occasions.   On to the important part...THE FOOD!   I have to admit I used my buddy Philip T's review to adjust my dining choices! (I trust his reviews)  My GF and I both got the Tonkatsu with garlic chips, the thick noodles, extra chasu pork and some spicy sauce.   I found everything to be enjoyable, but honestly it will be hard to get me back here! Ramen Sora and Hiromaru both have a much better Tonkatsu, so it will be tough to convince me to come back!   I would give their food 3.5 stars, but the shitty music and poor service was enough to put them at 3 stars.",

Because we were greeted by the one and only server there who seated us as well, took our orders, and refilled our drinks without us ever asking for it. Oh and by the way it was a full house! She was so cheerful and sweet I loved it! By far the best ramen place I've been to. It was amazingly delicious and the price was definitely worth every cent! I couldn't have been more satisfied. We also ordered the kimchi fried rice. We will be coming back here I'm so glad I found this hidden joint. Just worth it!",

    "text": "New ramen place, and it's good. It's a nice change from the oh so popular straight Tonkotsu ramen. Albeit, that's my favorite. This one is tonkotsu yes, but the broth isn't as thick and relentless as you tonkotsuites may be used to. Def recommend getting the deluxe as you get 4 pieces of chashu, a full egg, kikurage, negi (green onions), and noodles. The only downside is the soup isn't very hot. I usually like it when the broth comes in piping hot.  Also got a side of gyoza. The gyoza is delicious, however it is super garlicky so expect to bring some breath mints with you at the very least. Or don't eat it at all before heading out to the strip. Unless you like honey badger and you don't care. Got the Karaage as well. My mom and I both thought it would be a chicken drumstick as advertised in the picture but alas no, it wasn't. And it was the least tasty at our table.  As for price - I think it's reasonable. And the service isn't bad at all. Get here before everyone notices there's a new ramen spot in town!",

Comparing it to other ramen spots around town, isn't a real comparison because this is Tatsu.. and Tatsu is a comfy spot with really good food and a cozy atmosphere.   We will be back - and often. Thanks for having a 30 minute wait at the place we went prior to Tatsu - it made me happy to try another when the afore mentioned place,  always gives less than stellar service and haphazard presentations.  Tatsu tastes home made and well crafted. Go there.   P.S. As a reminder .. just because you don't like something - does not mean that \"it isn't good\" Another recent review mentions that \"ramen isn't his thing' so he gives the place 1 star. Seems legit.   Tatsu is worth your visit. it's really good.   Happy Eating!",

I would usually go to Ramen Kobo because it's only 5-7 minutes away, but I figured I should try out some new ramen places.   I got the shoyu ramen. The broth is a mix of chicken and pork with a little soy sauce. Toppings are half an egg and green onions, along with 2 pieces of pork. First off, I kinda liked the broth. For some reason, I felt like it's similar to a type of Korean soup base, which I bought from Greenland (I don't know how to say it, its all in Korean characters). The noodles were just okay. I traded off egg with my husband's kikurage (wood ear). He didn't like the kikurage at all, I guess it's an Asian thing. Wood ear was the same everywhere. The meat wasn't as tender as I expected.   Service was good. There was only one waitress while we were there but it wasn't crowded. We didn't have to wait long, not sure how it comes out when it's real lunch/dinner hours.",

Ramen came to mind and we narrowed it down to two options. Monta and Ramen Tatsu. We ended up chosing Ramen Tatsu for its close proximity to us and we were glad we did.  The establishment was nice and clean, and though the restaurant isn't exactly large, there was plenty of space for us. The vibe was relaxed, which was a welcomed change of pace from our trip. The waitress was super attentive and pleasant.  The offerings on the menu was fairly diverse, so... if you didn't feel like Ramen, you definitely had a lot of other options. Food was tasty and priced very well.  5 stars out of 5. Good food. Easy to get to. Relaxed environment. Not expensive. Definitely coming back to here soon!  We were at Ramen Tatsu at 9-930PM on a Friday night. The parking lot gets kind of packed due to the surrounding businesses. Leave a little early to account for parking. Being late for a date is not attractive. :P",

Ramen Tatsu is located in one of the busiest strip malls on Jones and Spring Mountain alongside other notable restaurants and businesses. Parking is usually very busy, so be on the lookout!  After getting situated, you'll find Ramen Tatsu tucked away at the north end of the plaza. Once inside, you are met with a quaint space with proper and kitschy Japanese decor.   The menu is easy to follow. And the food is great. I usually go with the Tonkatsu Ramen with a side of their chicken karaage. Also, beware! Their spicy levels are no joke... definitely not for the faint of heart. I love anything and everything spicy, but their special habanero peppers are no joke.",

Nevertheless, it's so good, we are definitely going again!",

    "text": "*sigh*  That was soo good!  First time having Tsukemen Ramen and i really enjoyed it.  I asked the server what's their specialty and was kindly steered to this offering.  It's basically a combination of seafood (mackerel) and pork broth.  Those of you with shellfish allergy don't fret.  You're good, brAh!    The noodles and soup are served in separate bowls, but it is entirely up to you if you want to marry them, or be a dipper.  Have at it.  I personally recommend being a dipper because well.. it's funner!  Food just taste better when the tone is right.  Whatever it is you choose to do, don't fuck it up. I'd hate to watch you enjoy your second serving!  On its own the stock can be really dense, but perfect when pair with the noodles.  Try not to grab too much noodles as it will really pick up on the intensity of the broth.  Loads of scallions are thrown in the clump of grains and topped off with 2 piece of char-siu, a lemon wedge, and a single strip of nori.  The soup is served NOT hot, yet it is warmer than warm.  A little squeeze of lemon over the noodles and this dish actually became quite refreshing in a way.  Sodium overload?? Ain't nobody got time for that!  If you're a fan of the soba zaru (cold buckwheat noodles) then i think you'll really like Tsukemen Ramen here.  Seared Pork belly was meaty and delish!  Would order again.  Gyoza however was alright.  +1 for GOOD air circulation    *cliff* How do i come about acquiring a stamp card??",

    "text": "The Skinny: at the end of the meal, I had a half filled bowl of broth - 'nuff said (3), service: efficient and fast (3); value: it's okay - not too pricey for a bowl of okay ramen... but nothing that I feel like I need to return for (3 stars).  When we saw the signs for a new ramen joint opening up in the Chinatown area, we were stoked. We love ramen - tonkotsu ramen in particular - and we were very interested to find a ramen joint that serves the traditional thinner white noodles with their tonkotsu broth.  We headed over to their soft opening just to see what they had to offer. I believe that their menu is truncated a bit at this time. No matter - we decided to hit up their Tonkotsu ramen ($7.77, 2 pc chasu, green onion, ginger and woodear mushroom) and their Ramen Tatsu (basically a tonkotsu ramen with more chasu and in bigger bowl of noodles).  Okay, let me get this straight. Ramen for me is all about the broth. That is the most difficult part to get right and where all the flavor comes from in your bowl. If I am leaving a bowl of ramen with at least half a bowl of broth behind, that says something - it just ain't that good. The tonkotsu broth didn't have the luxurious porky depth that it needs to really distinguish itself from other ramen joints in the city.  On to the rest of the bowl. The chasu in the bowl didn't really have much of a marinated flavor with it and rendered it a bit bland. The noodles - although they were the legit kind - were a little too soft for my taste. I would also venture to say, the bright pink ginger topping should be left to the side instead of incorporated in the bowl. I was also a little sad that the wasn't the option of adding an egg to your bowl. Perhaps this oversight will be corrected after the soft opening.  Another thing of note was they did not have togarashi to go with the ramen - only the chili oil. As my hubs is a total togarashi fanboy, he was verily disappointed.  Service is quick and efficient. I believe we were in and out within half and hour.  Overall, in the big scheme of things, Ramen Tatsu is alright. However based on the offerings today, I don't feel a huge urge to return again soon.(3 starred review).",

They are generous with the ingredients here and the tonkatsu was creamy and savory without the overpowering saltiness that some other ramen places serve. And man, when that bowl of ramen arrives, it's just gorgeous. Picture-perfect for all you asians, like me, who love to document their meals. Their chashu pork, although not very flavorful, is still pretty tasty. On my second visit, I got the idea to order the seared chashu and add it to my ramen. Yummy! They should totally have this option for toppings. The noodles were thinner in the tonkatsu but I didn't mind it. You probably can request the thicker noodles. A nice plus is that you can get a refill of noodles (kaedama) for only $1.50.  The restaurant is still pretty new so it has that awkward ambience of a place just starting up and the menu seems to be a work in progress. Would love to see this place do well amidst the growing number of ramen shops around town.",

    "text": "Just another Vegas restaurant with great ramen.  There's so many in town and each have their own preference, but Ramen Tatsu is definitely a good option.  This place serves their ramen a little differently where you can add the ingredients as you go rather than get a full ramen soup.  I ordered the spicy tonkatsu with added spicy sprouts and corn.  The base was actually quite spicy which is nice as most of the time I need to drench the soup in peppers or hot sauce to get a good kick.  The noodles were of the very thin variety and just ok.  The chasu was very good, with a nice line of fat for better flavor.  I'd say the broth was the best part of the meal with the chasu placing second.  The rest of the accompaniments were just average.  Not my favorite ramen in town but a True contender.  My entire meal was a little over $10 which is on the cheaper side for this dish.  I recommend trying Tatsu as it is a high quality rendition and lives up to its Vegas counterparts.",

Any time my fiance has taken me its been on a fri/sat around 8pm, so i have yet to see the \"late crowd\". if we ever go around 11 its been during the week. but we have seen families, groups of friends and couples.  Annnnyway....staff is very very attentive and fast.   l have been to a few katsu curry places, and ramen places. this place is amazing. the tankatsu curry chicken is so dang crunchy its rediculous!!! and the gyozo is the bomb! you can make your own dipping sauce with vinegar and soy sauce on table and its just fine. the curry is thick, dark brown like gravy....yuuuummmy!!!! Rice is sticky, and they give you a LOT. they have specials, so thats great for us! My fiance gets the ramen and always orders a side of noodles for like, a dollar...and always, always regrets it...they give you a huge bowl, full of the greatest ramen noodles ever :) he always eats the food i have left on my plate,cuz i get full quick. but this little white girlie doesnt have much left for him here! i eats it allll!! haha!! The ramen bowl i think he gets is called Delux. he really likes it, and he's filipino, always getting me to try different places.   beer selection and prices are good, have specials too.   only reason i havent given 5 stars is because i actually haven't tried a ramen bowl...yet. ;)",

Chef/Owner, Wayne, obviously cares about the quality of his food.   The karaage is still very tasty, but there may have been a slight change to the batter. It's a little lighter than the previous version, which I preferred, but it is still a very, very good and well-seasoned karaage.  My family still includes Tatsu in our weekly restaurant rounds.",

    "text": "We've found another favorite ramen place! We started with appetizers: the Japanese kimchi ( which was more vinegary than the Korean kimchis I've tried),  goes very well with the smoky seared chashu. Their takoyaki comes in 4 pieces. Most of the takoyakis I've tried in other places have raw dough taste, but the ones here are  flavorful, crunchy on the outside and deliciously creamy inside, I highly recommend this.  The karaage is crispy, and even though it's fried, it's not greasy at all. The greens and refreshing  dressing that come with it complement the takoyaki & the karaage. My companion had the Shoyu ramen. The chicken broth was tasty. The egg was cooked well. The noodles were chewy in a good way. The chashu pork was buttery with just the right amount of fat.  I had the Tonkotsu ramen,which has a delicious smoky broth. It also comes with melts in your mouth chashu. Their ramen servings are huge.  Good enough for 2 people.  Service is fast and efficient. Servers are nice and friendly. Place is clean and inviting. My only wish is that they change the piped in music which rendered horrendous covers of pop music from the likes of Alicia Keys and Colbie Caillat. Other than that, this place is highly recommended. Will definitely be back. :)",

My husband ordered the Deluxe ramen which is humongous, you better be really hungry. It has a tonkotsu - shoyu broth and is loaded with lots of veggies. I ordered the Spicy tonkotsu ramen which has a habanero spice. It had a really good flavor but not spicy at all to me though, so I'd probably get extra spicy next time. I asked them for thick noodles instead of the thin ones it normally comes with which I liked. The Chasiu meat is so soft and tender, melts in your mouth and is one of my favorite chasiu in town. They also have happy hour prices for appetizers from 3-6pm. The Gyoza was good but the takoyaki was blah. I couldn't even taste or see any octopus meat in it. Other than that the ramen was very delicious and our server was cheerful and friendly.",

The chasu pork slices are bigger here than other ramen joints, which is a definite plus. The noodles could use more work though. Everything here is served quickly and with a smile.

I'd been craving some authentic Japanese ramen for a few days, so Mark and I thought we'd give it a try. I was really looking forward to the tonkotsu ramen. Tonkotsu is a pork based broth that is very time-consuming to make; the southern Japanese island of Kyushu is probably the capital of tonkotsu ramen, and I've had the real thing many times.  Chef Wayne Kageyama's tonkotsu did not disappoint; it was not as rich as the shiru (soup) that I became accustomed to in Fukuoka, and it had a decidedly smoky flavor that I didn't expect but was most pleasantly surprised by. The tonkotsu ramen was the only menu choice to offer the thin noodles that I prefer, and the smokiness of the broth was an excellent foil for the kimchi that I ordered extra as a topping. The very generous portion quite sated me; I had no reason or desire to order extra noodles or soup.  Mark ordered the shoyu ramen, which came with the thick noodles. The garlic chips that he ordered were a little overpowering, but the broth was delicate and not too salty at all.  We ordered a side of gyoza (better known to Americans as \"pot stickers\") and a side of takoyaki - small dough balls filled with pieces of octopus and topped, usually, with a sweet teriyaki type sauce, Japanese mayonnaise and shredded or powdered nori.   The gyoza were delightful; well-stuffed, fried perfectly and then quickly steamed in the pan to offer a contrast of crunch and chew. They brought back fond memories of sake-soaked late nights in mom-and-pop shops that abound in the back alleys of Osaka, trying to stave off the next morning's inevitable hangover, heh heh.   Osaka is famous for takoyaki, and unfortunately I found Tatsu's to be a small disappointment in an otherwise exceptional and very authentic meal. There was not enough octopus, and the the sauce that topped them off was almost sweet enough to make them a dessert. I must admit though, I did eat all of them!  I highly recommend this comfortable and clean restaurant for an authentic and reasonably priced adventure into Japanese cuisine. Chef Kageyama is very affable; the staff, who are all Japanese, are pleasant and efficient, and more than willing to overlook the errors in my Japanese, which has become a bit rusty of late.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall on the east side of South Jones, between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn; parking is not a problem. Beer (served ice-cold), wine, and hot and cold sake are available. Major credit cards are accepted. Dessert is conspicuously absent from the menu, but there IS a Baskin-Robbins right across the street, should you feel the need for something sweet afterward. If this review convinces you to try Ramen Tatsu out, please give a \"hello\" to chef Kageyama from me -the \"gaijin\" from Osaka!",

The pork was good had nice flavor but was tough its like i needed a knife to cut it. :( This is the first time I had a bad review for a ramen place and it makes me sad.",

Don't get me wrong, the restaurant is not so bad, just doesn't live up to the Yelp rating.  The gyoza and pork tonkatsu appetizers are pretty good.  The tonkatsu was quite moist on the inside and had a decent golden fried exterior.  Both are good choices.  The ramen broth is so so, not much depth or favor for the spicy miso ramen.  Spicy it is, but that mostly drowns out the miso broth.  The noodles are cooked perfectly, very chewy.  Portion is generous and it's a pretty good deal for $9.99.  Japanese style service which is excellent, (the restaurant is actually run by Japanese).  It's worth another try for their other broths.",

    "text": "Slightly disappointed in the flavor of the broth, the texture of the ramen, and the overall experience of my tonkatsu ramen. I guess you can say I've been spoiled with ramen from LA and SF, so my expectations were pretty high for Ramen Tatsu. Maybe I came in on an off day because I certainly did not experience their 4.5 star reputation on yelp. The tonkatsu broth was the slightest bit tasty and wasn't fatty enough for my taste. The ramen, although generous in portion, was not al-dente but soggy as if it had been sitting in the bottom of the bowl for hours. The toppings didn't come with much: mound of green onions, two slices of cha siu,  and wood ear. I added my own egg, which was probably my favorite part of the ramen.  Nonetheless, the service was great! Green tea was perfect for a rainy night and to soothe my throat. I probably won't be coming here again with Jinya only a short drive away.",

Maybe by Vegas standards 4.5 but not by Hawaii standards!  Since the tone of this review started out no-so-hot, let's start with bad news.  What is wrong you ask?  The noodles and the broth!  The top two most important components of ramen!    The noodles did not have a smooth, even consistency--texture felt knotty.  Imagine a noodle that wasn't fully cooked throughout: most parts cooked but small scattered lumps uncooked.  Sorry if I'm not articulating well, in a nutshell, noodles = not good!  It didn't get any better with the broth.  =( The broth lacked depth of flavor and had zero body.  Really thin, watery broth!  It's not all bad, there is good news!  - Cheaply priced.  All menu items offered at bargain basement cost.  Hard to complain much when you aren't breaking the bank.  - Fried rice was delish!  Bowl of fried rice hit the spot!  Soo good that I didn't want to share with my wife!  LoL  Some good, some bad.  Vegas needs to step up their ramen game!",

He's always smiling and was always in a good mood which is great and made me and my boyfriend feel happy as well. It's amazing to have a good worker serving us and having good food. He looked like he liked his job and always did something and didn't waste his time and wasn't lazy. He comes and asks us if we were doing okay. He was very humble and I noticed he was waiting to say goodbye to us and have a good day on our way out as he was doing other things. A very great experience! Will always come back.",

    "text": "Parking is a nightmare here! Anyways, their seating system is kind of dumb. There were a few parties before us, but the party right before us got sat at a table who had the table next to them finishing up... the server should have waited for this other two top to finish and sit party of two before us, so that my party of 3 could also sit since we needed two tables to be put together and the 2 table that opened was a stand-alone .. we weren't able to sit and a Peru of 2 who came after got to sit. In the end I wanted 30 mins for a table!! Ridiculous. The ramen broth was nice but a bit salty. I got the tonkotsu. My friend got the spicy miso and it was very spicy. My boyfriend got the shoyu and did the $1 add on of mild spicy and that was the perfect spice. His soup was okay. Really liked the spicy miso besides how spicy it is .. maybe I'll get regular miso and add spice to it. They have pitchers of beer for $20. I hope they change their ways of sitting so I won't have to wait so long next time. Don't bring big parties here... and also don't stick around and eat cake like this family did .. took up 4 tables and they took their sweet ass time eating their cake.",

    "text": "Real ramen made by real Japanese people! I don't want that to sound racist but hey its the truth.  This place is THE place for ramen in the valley. Having eaten a every ramen-ya in the valley, I settled for the fact that we will were forever doomed to ramen mediocrity.  The main notables for ramen in the valley do a good job filling a craving for ramen they all fail hit the spot for me.  As you can already figure out, I am a bit of a Japanese food snob as I have had the opportunity to live in the motherland for many years and made it a mission to eat many a ramen-ya and try the best ramen of many prefectures.   I am not really bias to one particular style of ramen and usually default to the respective Ramen-ya's specialty.  For this place they had a nice array of ramen types from traditional miso and shoyu to curry ramen.    We opted to try one mild (miso) and one wild (curry).  I chose the curry ramen as I am a fan of curry udon so this was right up my alley. I enjoyed this bowl however it didn't blow my mind: it was \"different\" . The curry flavor was very subtle and ended up getting washed away with the base broth and eventually was lost.I think I will stick to curry udon and 86 the ramen variant.   The Miso Ramen was the champ here! The base was very sweet and rich and at first bite transported me back to the motherland. Ensure that your order this with corn, butter and garlic: The REAL way to enjoy miso ramen.  Butter you say? Don't knock it until you rock it. I mean if it wasn't good why would they have it on the menu? And besides that's how we do it in the motherland..  Take it from me this place does miso ramen legit!! This is now my default for my ramen fix in the Vegas Valley.   Eat with confidence   -P",

    "text": "My new favorite ramen obsession!   I don't know why it's taken me forever and a day to eat here. Usually when I go to a ramen place, I measure them by their gyoza and their miso ramen. I actually haven't tried the miso ramen yet here because I've been getting their delicious tsukemen! Their version has a strong fish flavor and reminded me of David Chang's Mind of A Chef where he looks into making bonito in Japan. Their egg is perfectly soft-boiled and the chasu served cold is thick and full of flavor. The noodles are extra thick, firm, and flatter than your normal ramen noodle in order to increase surface area for dipping. My husband has ordered the tonkatsu shoyu, which also has a fishy taste. He enjoyed it and his leftovers were still delicious the next day, which I attribute to the noodles holding up very well. As far as sides go, the gyoza meat was a bit dry, so I probably wouldn't order that again, but the curry rice and the side salad are satisfying and filling. The kimchi fried rice isn't too spicy, which I liked, but may be a turn-off for those who want kimchi fried rice from a Korean restaurant. Their iced green tea is not canned or bottled, which is an extra plus for me. It's only $1.77 too with free refills! (a lot of their pricing ends in .77 cents). To top it all off, they have two TVs that are angled strategically for maximum viewing pleasure and the servers here handle their business efficiently and are very helpful/friendly. I'll be back for more :D",

My boyfriend ordered the katsu curry and it tasted below average. He ordered it knowing it wasn't going to taste authentic because he's not a big fan of ramen, so he didn't have much to choose from.   Don't get me started on the takoyaki lol.  The reason for the low stars is because of service. We didn't get approached till 10-15 minutes after we sat down.   On the plus side, I think it's cool that they have more options (like curry) that any other ramen place I've been to.   I probably won't visit again since they have so much competition around them, which I have yet to try.",

Its signage can easily be missed. Just look for District One and you'll eventually spot Ramen Tatsu.  When we arrived, the restaurant was surprisingly empty on a Saturday around dinnertime, but it was nice having the place to ourselves. I ordered the Tonkotsu and my boyfriend ordered the Spicy Miso. By the way, the marinated soft boiled egg doesn't come with the ramen. It's an additional $1 charge for an item commonly free at other ramen restaurants.   Tonkotsu Ramen - The broth had a meaty flavor. Noodles were firm, thin, and cooked well. Pork was fatty, fat, fat. The green onions were on the heavy side.  Spicy Miso - Unless you want to feel more heat, there's no need for additional red pepper. If you've had the spicy miso at Jinya, this is comparable to theirs.   Being the only diners in the restaurant, service was quick and we received our hot bowls of ramen in an instant.   The food is decent, and we didn't pay over $10 for each of our orders.",

My friend is a huge fan of tsukemen ramen (known as cold ramen). Now if you're not familiar with this... It's basically ramen noodles separated from the soup. You pick up your portion size of noodles and dip it into the soup. The noodles are a lot fatter, almost resembling pasta noodles and the soup is a lot more thick.   *There aren't many ramen places that serve this on Vegas. She's a fan because she's from California and they serve this a lot there!*  The broth was delicious and the taste was delightful. I don't know how else to explain it. You have to go and try it for yourself. I will advise tho that even I had to trade out my chopsticks for a fork because my noodles kept slipping.  Let me add that this place doesn't get overly packed! It's a consistent flow of business, but I'm sure you won't find yourself waiting to be seated.",

Went in with my BF and split the deluxe tonkotsu-shoyu, the house specialty per Tetsuro. Deluxe bowl comes decked out with all of the extra veggies and meat: four slices of chashu, nori, an egg, green onion, sprouts, corn, cabbage, and bamboo shoots. Also added on orders of edamame, karaage, and lychee sorbet.  Broth was understated but still had good depth, and the various toppings and giant bowl made it a more than generous portion for two, well-priced at just under $11. Egg was a little overcooked, which is  a ramen pet peeve of mine and I also didn't care for the corn or overwhelming amount of cabbage.   Karaage was moist and I really enjoyed the light breading. Squeezed some lemon over it for an extra perk of acidity.  Sorbet was a great palate cleanser with a pop of flavor, larger portion than what is given gratis at Ramen Misoya Tomi.   Wouldn't put this in my top ramen picks for Vegas, but wouldn't turn down a visit if a friend suggested it, either.",

The server was extremely nice and brought us some water and sapparos immediately. We ordered the miso ramen with medium spice and added garlic chips. This is HANDS DOWN the best ramen I have ever had in the Vegas area. The noodles were perfect, not too hard or soft and the perfect thickness. The broth was so extremely flavorful, and the added garlic and spice made it even more amazing. I have never actually finished an entire bowl of ramen before, and I ate everything, including the broth. We also got some strawberry mochi ice cream, which was the cherry on top. Will most definitely be returning as soon as possible!",

We were a bit early evening by design, about 4:45pm beats the crowds, and we found there was a happy hour menu, 4-6pm.  We were hungry and picked a few things from the menu as well as the happy hour menu, can't resist $3 Asahi! We also ended up with edamame, goyza, chicken katsu curry, the deluxe ramen and the shoyu ramen, all very good.   I'm still tasting the curry and will want to come back for the curry ramen! All very good, food, good service, enjoyed the 'blues' background music and of course my husband as company!   Will keep this place on the list for the wintery cold nights when a bit of warm soup will go far to hit the spot!",

Emi, our server, was so nice and even explained the origins of the really neat tiny houses around the restaurant. This place is so good it almost makes me regret moving to California.

And i tried their spicy miso ramen which was totemo oishii desu!! The first ramen place in US that took me back to the little ramen shop in sapporo!! So thrilled that i finaly get the flavor that i hVe been craving for. The broth is very rich with flavor and yes its spicy!! My husband tried their curry... Which was delish and authentic. And oh did i mention about their Karaage??? Must try item on the menu! Glad that Now i have a reason to be excited About if vegas come to our trip radar!",

Our last attempt at a different spot was foiled with long lines and limited seating. Tatsu is nicely decorated and had ample seating.  The waitress who greeted us was extremely friendly, and taught my kids different Japanese words and phrases. The menu is simple and straightforward--ramen, appetizers, and katsu curry. Our party of nine ordered several selections of ramen, karage, gyoza, and tonkatsu curry. I ordered the deluxe. Everyone seemed pleased with their meals. The spicy had a good amount of flavor and spice. The chasiu was flavorful and the right amount. Next time I would probably hold the cabbage.  Good experience. We will definitely return.",

    "text": "It seems like there's a new ramen place keep popping up in Vegas lately.  \"Ramen Tatsu\" has been around for about couple of years now, and my recent visit was my first time there.  I had a Japanese buddy of mine from San Francisco Bay Area visiting during the CES convention, and we usually go to a ramen place at least once during his visit.  This time we went to Tatsu and we were very pleased.  My buddy's name is \"Tetsu\" so, I remembered to go to \"Tatsu.\"  We started with some beer and chicken kara-age (Japanese style chicken nuggets) and some pot stickers.  The pot stickers were good, but, no different than any other good ramen places. I can probably pan fry those pot stickers a little better than they can.  Kara-age was crispy outside and moist inside.  Perfect!  That shows me they're very good in deep frying.  Then we ordered our main.  My buddy ordered the \"Tsukemen\"  It's a thick ramen that almost look like udon noodles which comes with two types of dipping sauce.  I'm not much of a fan of eating ramen dipping it in a sauce.  I'd rather do that with a cold udon or soba.  However, those dipping sauces were delicious.  I ordered the Deluxe ramen that comes with extra slices of  cha-shu.  I can tell the cha-shu is home made, and sliced thicker than you usually see at a ramen place.  Those cha-shu were very tender and flavorful with not too much fat.  The noodle was firm and very well done, the way I like it.  Toppings were similar to the stuff I use when I make my own ramen, so, not surprised there.  Tonkotsu-Shoyu (Soy sauce based pork broth) soup was also, excellent.  Very rich broth, not oily, nor salty.  Very authentic Japanese ramen soup.  Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen originated in Yokoyama (Kanagawa Prefecture) and, has been popular in the Kanto region (Seven eastern prefectures including Tokyo).  Tonkotsu (pork bone) ramen is basically, a traditional ramen in Kyushu.  It's like a mixture of both, Shoyu ramen of Kanto with tonkotsu ramen of Kyushu.  Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen noodles are the regular curly ramen noodles rather than the straight thin type normally used in the Kyushu or \"Hakata style\" ramen.  On the scale of 1 to 10, I would give this ramen a 9.  It would've been a 10 if the cha-shu was properly seared on the outside.  The word \"cha-\" of \"cha-shu\" comes from the Chinese \"chaasiu\" or \"char siu\" which means \"barbequed\" or \"seared\" pork.  Obviously, ramen was invented by a Chinese cook in Japan, unclear of when, but, some historians say about 350 years ago; hence it uses the naming from Chinese words, and uses both Chinese and Japanese style of cooking.  At least I know it's been around for more than a century, and became popular in the 1950s.  Now I've got a place to go for Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen!",

    "text": "Recently I was invited to a dinner which featured several of the most famous Las Vegas Japanese restaurant owners. It was unanimous in their opinion that they believed RAMEN TATSU was the best TOKYO RAMEN-YA in America. Yes, you heard that statement correctly. TATSU is NOT a Kyushu Ramen-Ya, it is a TOKYO style Ramen-Ya that specializes in Shoyu style broth. If you don't believe me, ask the owner himself. The owners name is Wayne and he is a very respected man in the LV Japanese-American community.   RAMEN TATSU is unique in the fact that all ingredients are natural/organic style. Wayne uses three different types of natural chicken bones for the broth in his Tokyo style ramen. He also uses three different types of natural pork bones for his Tonkotsu ramen. No other ramen-ya in Las Vegas goes this far out of their way to produce such a rich broth. Many Japanese yelpers express that the reason California(Sawtelle Blvd) ramen is so much better than LV ramen is because the California places use this style of cooking. The cook and owner has been the force behind many of the popular ramen-yas in Los Angeles. He was the man responsible for the recipes which have now achieved notoriety, the same recipes from the LA ramen-yas that attended this years Ramen festival at the Rio Casino.   The signature dish at RAMEN TATSU is the Shoyu-Tonkotsu fusion. This variation of ramen has become increasingly popular in modern day Japan. It's origins stem from the Kobe area, where it has become a new subregional variation of ramen. On account of the fact that Wayne is from Kobe, he has many years of experience preparing this subregional variation.  The recipe at TATSU remains unchanged from the recipe from Kobe while Monta's Shoyu-Tonkotsu is not the authentic recipe, instead it is merely an invention of the Kurume cook(who is now a Brazilian dude), who mixes his Kyushu broth with a generic nonaffiliated shoyu broth. What I am expressing is that RAMEN TATSU has the only authentic Shoyu-Tonkotsu in LV. And, this is the item you should order during your next visit.    The Curry- During your next visit at RAMEN TATSU, you should not neglect the Japanese Curry. TATSU uses their own secret recipe which facilities a unique taste which upon my assessment is superior to CoCo Ichinbanya and Kaba Curry. In a demonstration of unique cooking styles, the Chicken broth from the ramen is used as the backing for the curry. Wayne's own particular Gram Masala is then instilled into the broth, and combined with three different types of vegetables. The resulting product is curry that is as addictive as Mr. Zenbayashi's recipe. And during a recent conversation with Mr. Zenbayashi, even he verbally approved of Wayne's recipe. That is a major compliment coming from the man who runs the highest rated Curry-Ya in yelp history.   They also have Shio Ramen which is great for older Japanese folks. A lot of older Japanese people like my Dad refuse to eat Tonkotsu and Miso Ramen, and eat nothing but Shio.   I will argue that RAMEN TATSU is the most authentic Japanese Ramen-Ya in America. It remains True to the regional recipes in Japan, and the owner refuses to submit to western pressures to \"Americanize\" his recipes(as you can see, many of the negative reviews are due to the fact that the recipe is not americanized). For example, Wayne recently terminated contracts with noodle suppliers because he felt they were not completely authentic to Japanese standards. For the last few weeks, several Japanese noodle companies have been competing for the contract, while Wayne assesses and samples them all to determine which is the most appropriate. The whole reason that Tsukemen is no longer on the menu is because Wayne demanded his distributors send noodles which were 100% authentic to the dish and made in Japan. He would not accept anything lower, and would NEVER serve an item that wasn't 100% authentic to the traditional Japanese recipe. Tsukemen will return shortly from my understanding. This establishment represents the Japanese culture very proudly and will not give into the pressures to westernize the menu. This is the reason there is no Togarashi. This is the reason there is no Srirachi. This is the reason why there is no cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon. Just like the owner of Kabuto, Wayne won't breech protocol which was established in Japan by the Japanese, for the Japanese. And I respect him a lot for this. Complaining that there is no  Shichimi Togarashi at a ramen-ya is like bitching to the chef at Kabuto about why there is no California rolls while you soak your chutoro nigiri in a mixture of shoyu and wasabi that you plan on eating with a fork. I have to say that I vouch for RAMEN TATSU and encourage all the Japanese-American residents of LV to support this business.   Just a final note- The music they play here is the theme music to the Final Fantasy games, and old school anime like Cutey Honey, Candy Candy, and the Miyazaki films",

Waitress was super nice as well. Prices very very reasonable and could easily be a couple dollars higher anywhere else. Would love to come back here again on our next trip to Las Vegas.",

Plus the service here is really good they tend to you right away and my food comes out pretty fast. The ramen though I'd have to say kinda reminds me of the ramen in Hawaii (yum) the broth isn't too salty and the noodles are soft so I'd have to say the food here is good enough. I love ordering the spicy miso tho with the extra spiciness and an extra egg. The portions are enough to fill you up so its good. The atmosphere and the inside looks well decorated and they play good music here hahaha they even have desserts too! But I haven't tried any of the desserts here. This place is worth a try it's authentic Japanese noodles (:",

This is not the other Japanese restaurant in the same mall. Besides the food, the place is very clean and cozy.

Overall price was adequate for quality and amount of food. Everything was served hot and fresh. The service was provided by the owner herself, she was friendly and quick to refill drinks and check in on us. We came during the happy hour special which starts at 3pm. It wasn't too busy, which made it a perfect spot for my girls and I to chat. The environment was clean and open.   Definitely recommend and will return.",

    "text": "Been to many Ramen places. In town, and out of town (travel for work) and I gotta say that I love this place!  When I lived in CA I would travel from the Bay Area to Sacramento for Shoki House (their first location), and sometimes to New Tokyo Ramen in Marina, but Ramen Tatsu is awesome. So happy this place is local for me.  I heard about a few other ramen places in town that people rave about, but the wait times were long, service below average and the ramen tasted like it was quickly prepared and lacked anything that made it stand out.  Ramen Tatsu takes care of you.   Friendly staff.  Been here 5 times now and will continue to come. I don't think they've remembered me yet but each time they're kind, attentive and generous. This place has even given us some of their iced green tea to take home and catered to our 'not a lot of time but really wanted ramen' needs when we needed to rush an order. They rushed it right through by serving two cups of our tea, the check right after food and our second order of noodle right on time while still keeping is from feeling like we were being a bother or like we were just a quick dollar for them.   Great food.  Again, top notch ramen in Vegas. Maybe the 'other' ramen joint that people rave about (starts with an M;) was great in the past, but the last few times I've gone it's been average/good, not great and definitely not as good as Ramen Tatsu.  I've narrowed my go-to bowl as the Shoyu with an extra egg and extra noodle mid way through. My girlfriend enjoys the Spicy Tonkotsu with an egg. It's definitely spicy. Two scoops of hers on my Shoyu change things up enough for me.  She's had to extra spicy miso too, but enjoys the Tonkotsu more so.   Price is awesome. We both eat for less than $30 and that includes extra noodles, extra eggs, edemame, two iced green teas (these are delicious), and green tea mochi ice cream. All on top of our two bowls of ramen.   All in all, I rank it up their for Ramen joints. I'll be back, many....many more times.",

The menu is simple & offers several different options. It also offers separate topping options for your choice of ramen. The environment is cozy & the decor is simple.

And after trying the fusion ramen place, which was a pretty big disappointment, I thought I should just stay with what I know and go with the popular places. But after reading one reviewer's detailed description on how True the owner is on ingredient and style at the place, I figured I'd give it a try.   And now I think I don't ever have to go to Monta anymore, especially Monta is pretty much a guarantee to stand in line kind of place.  It's a cute little place run by real Japanese folks. The Japanese lady who took our order is so cute and attentive. If you check in on yelp you can get a free drink, ice green tea included.   They have many variety of ramens, just like other ramen places. The pork is perfect in between Monta and Sora. I always think the pork at sora is too big and fatty, and pork at Monta is too thin and a bit stingy. Pork here is perfect size and they have regular size noodles and thin noodles, just depends on what type of ramen you get. And their egg is perfectly cooked. The yoke is to perfection.   Their karaage is THE BEST I've ever had. Meaty, perfect crispness without too much breading and not oily at all.  You must order it when you go.   I really don't need to go stand in line at Monta for my ramen fix anymore!!",

It doesn't come with many ingredients but that's what I love about it, simple and delicious. You can always side order additional toppings of your choice. The broth is dense and full of flavor, though it might be a bit salty. The meat was cooked right, I enjoyed my ramen with a carefully selected and prepared chasiu :)  The decor of the restaurant is very nice, simple and not flashy.

I have tried other ramen here, but I usually go back to shio every time. The takoyaki is really good as an appetizer and I love the cute macaroons filled with ice cream for dessert. The deluxe ramen is so delicious, but you've got to have a huge appetite to be able to eat it all. The fact that I can have a hot green tea or a Sapporo with my ramen is just the icing on the cake. Love this place.",

We were a group of 5 tired and hungry people and were all beyond happy with the overall experience here. The server was very friendly and helped us with the order. Never did she fail to smile and made sure that our glasses were filled to the brim at all times!! Though it was pretty late (almost toward the closing time) on a weekday, the quality of food and service didn't lack a thing. The spicy miso ramen couldn't be any better. Have had so many ramen all around the country, and this to me, is one of the bests. If you like your ramen spicy, spicy miso is the ramen for you. The tonkatsu ones are scrumptious as well. The broths were creamy (but not too much), keeping it just perfect and they all tasted awesome. My sister in law loved their fried rice as well. Oh, don't forget to order their takoyaki; it was aaammaazing! I would definitely be back here whenever I'm visiting the area.",

I hear the owner brings in Sun noodles from Hawaii.  The ramen noodle is thin, soft yet firm, holds its own taste while holding the flavor of the broth very well.  The broth is rich and flavorful.   I've had the spicy miso ramen, chicken curry, spicy tonkatsu ramen, and tsukemen.  All, very lovely.  I don't say this too often while traveling, this is a must eat if you are looking for ramen worth eating.    Service is well done.  They were very accommodating with us, a large group filled with hungry children.  Food was brought out quickly.  Its a tiny place, yet provides a comforting and welcoming ambiance.",

    "text": "Its good to see that Las Vegas is finally getting a good selection of ramen houses. Ramen Tatsu was recommended by a friend who frequents this place and I have to agree that they offer one of the better tasting ramens in Vegas. The ramen shop is quaint, tightly packed (just like most authentic Japanese ramen houses), and run by very pleasant people. We ordered the spicy tonkotsu, shoyu ramen, takoyaki and kimchi rice and weren't disappointed by the flavors and serving portions. The ramen noodles were cooked perfectly, not soggy nor was it undercooked. The broths were delicious and had very satisfying umami flavors. If I had any gripe it would just be the smaller than usual sized takoyakis (down from the golfball-sized ones I'm used to), which had tastiness that made up for the lack of portions. I'm sure me and wifey will now include this spot as part of our ramen rotations, especially now that our usual go-to places are always packed to the brim. But make no mistake, Ramen Tatsu isn't just a substitute ramen place, it's now a must-eat there place!",

It did make me hot & made my nose run, BUT I DON'T CARE! It was that good.  There is so many great other businesses located in the same plaza. It's packed with various other Asian owned businesses, which look to be thriving. So, you can get tons of errands run & taken care of in one spot.  Oh! And to make it even better, we had the DOPEST waitress was the SHIZ & her name happens to be Shizuka (which means, \"SHUT UP!\") HAHAHA!!! She is the best!

You walk in, get greeted, with plenty of seating area available. I've had ramen in Japan and this place come preeeeeetty close to the ramen shops in Japan.  Me and my boyfriend got the takoyaki & shrimp shumai to start. Takoyaki was fresh and warm, crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. One thing I wish they served on top of this is bontio flakes! Shrimp shumai was steamed and also very tasty. Both great appetizers to start off with.  I had the tonkatsu shoyu and my boyfriend got the deluxe ramen. If you like tonkatsu broth I'd highly recommend trying this... the shoyu brings out a little more flavor of the tonkatsu and isn't too salty. The noodles had a perfect texture (I hate when its super mushy & soft). Servings are pretty generous and prices are very affordable to other ramen spots in town.   The only downside about this place is parking.... be prepared to drive around the lot a few times although I did see some people parked the across the street.",

We ordered the gyoza and they took a little longer to come out. The skin was super thin and it was really well crimped, but the bottoms was a little too charred for my taste.   When it comes to ramen, I tried the tsukemen and the veggie ramen. The tsukemen is a bonito/miso base. The broth was a little thinner than I've had in the past for dipping noodles. It was still good, but not my favorite.   The veggie ramen was really good! I think I actually preferred it to the tsukemen (although their chasu is really good). Veggie broth was full and flavorful.   Service was great. Food was great. What else could you ask for?",

It looks like a typical Japanese restaurant walking in, with that Japanese decor and vibe. We were seated immediately and placed our order. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with extra chasu. The broth was decent, nothing too special. The meat was flavorful, soft and very good. I also ordered the karage as an appetizer and it was good, but tasted like any other place.",

This was rather bland by itself and needed some uplifting flavors.  That being said...I'd still give this five stars for how great the ramen was.",

We called this place and was told there is no wait time so we quickly got into our cars and zoomed on over. Sure enough there were a few open tables.  We ordered a few Ramen dishes, curry katsu, fried rice, soboro bowl ( marinated groundbeef and eggs) and shumai. All was to our taste and liking. Food was made quickly. Typical Ramen place with rice dishes to the menu and sides. I'd return if in the area. Happy eats!!",

The chashiu and the takoyaki was good though, but not good enough to make me forget about the bad service.   A member of our party ordered extra chashiu, but didn't receive it (we thought, because we asked for it on the side). The server said the chef put it into the soup. She then walked over, leaned over our table and proceeded to point (with her fingers practically in the bowl) and count each piece of meat in my friend's bowl as he was eating. We had other issues with the food/service during our meal and the staff handled each of them terribly.",

The egg was cooked perfectly and the noodles were nice and al dente. That being said, somehow I prefer the taste of the noodles at Monta Ramen. My husband and friend got the Shoyu Ramen and they both said the taste was unique and good. Gyozas were pretty good but I would pass on the shrimp shumai.",

Except for today... unfortunately the Tsukemen broth wasn't thick at all, it was barely sticking onto the noodles. The broth was seasoned poorly. I'm honestly not sure if they didn't add enough bonito but it basically tasted like lightly salted tap water. My friend and I both asked for new broth explaining how it didn't taste the same, and the waitress was happy enough to comply to our request. The second broth came out and it tasted the same, if not worse lol. Being one of the few ramen places in Vegas i'm really disappointed with what happened.  Sad to say i'll be taking my business elsewhere for Ramen until they bring back their old Tsukemen recipe!",

Menu- one star  Good menu options with some variety in the ramen selection together with some nice small dishes with pretty authentic flavor and taste to it. Went there twice and order two different type of ramen and had a good time eating them. Also, ordered some sides and it was pretty good.   Decor/ ambiance- one star   Very traditional location with a very casual feel to it. Laid back decor that reminds those Japanese's interior design.   Service- one star  The staff was very friendly and nice. Always attentive and very fast which I definitely appreciate it.  Wow factor- no star   Missing that wow factor. Ramen was good but not the best I had.   Overall- one star  Had a good experience and would definitely come back next time I am in Vegas.",

It would've been one thing if it was just my bowl, but my friend's charsiu was cold too. It's clear that they cooked the charsiu before they opened and added it into the ramen after the broth was poured into the bowl. I may come back to try the appetizers and rice dishes, but I don't think I'll come back for the ramen. If you like thick noodles, try Ramen Sora instead.",

Ramen Tatsu exceeded my expectations,  they're the only place I know that serves Tsukemen ramen, this availability took my obsession for ramen to another level. If you're unfamiliar with Tsukemen Ramen, it's popularity has grown over the years, and one of the most notable concept of ramen as a regional style, is that it is undressed and the cold noodles are dipped into an accompanying bowl of fishy, undiluted broth before slurping. do not expect a traditional bowl of ramen swimming in a sea of broth. This makes for a great dish during the hot summer months of Las Vegas. I opted to add a few toppings to my noodles as well. RT's sweet, spicy, citrusy broth clinging to extra-fat tsukemen noodles (Not udon) Has introduced to another dimension of ramen like no other, Move over everyone! Ramen tatsu's Tsukemen has staked its claim in the noodle pantheon of sin city. Have no mercy!",

Ambiance looks good, smells good, tastes good, but needs a bit of color or pizazzz in the bowl.  I just don't feel the magic...  The green onions were the only vibrant add on in my spicy tonkatsu ramen.  The broth itself was good n porky, habanero infusion adds a kick to the tastebuds!  When it comes to any Japanese cuisine, I have come to expect the visual sensations as well as the palate sensations to come together in a harmonious combination of flavor and flair.  I know....sounds like a food snob but truth be told!  Imagine a California roll with no red crab, no green avo, just white rice n black seaweed, still look appetizing?  Back to the ramen, maybe add some red daikon? Shredded carrot? Cucumber leaf?  Fish cake swirly thing? An habanero slice? (no seeds!)  I'm no chef, but I know what looks and tastes good!  Ima give em another shot but on to the next...  *iromaru here I come  Try every Ramen joint in Vegas?   Challenge accepted!!!!  Tanoshimu!",

They clean up tables quick and the turn around is great. The server was apologetic when she didn't need to be while we were waiting for the food.

I've had Monta, Fukumimi, and Ramen Sora and eventually figured there wasn't anything else that could be done to outdo any of the others. Recently I went to Ramen Tatsu and loved everything about it. Most importantly: curry ramen. I've never seen this on the other menus so I got the extra spicy version and it was amazing. I loved the atmosphere too: it wasn't too crowded and the service was very friendly. I was also glad they weren't playing top 40 hits like a lot of the other Japanese restaurants seem to be doing. I noticed they have a happy hour with discounted appetizers and beer but it apparently didn't apply during the holiday season. I will definitely come back here just for the curry ramen and I'd love to try the tsukemen too.",

I ordered the tonkotsu and my boyfriend ordered the shoyu with Entry Level spicy. We also ordered karaage on the side. The food came in a timely manner, broth was still hot. My boyfriend enjoyed the spiciness of the challenge level available on their menu. The habanero paste is housemade and they also add ghost pepper powder to kick it up a notch. For me, the charsiu didn't have much flavor. But the broth was pretty good, not too salty. The karaage was piping hot and crispy - delicious! Overall, I enjoyed it and would definitely recommend!",

They let you pick your spice levels and let me tell you... the spice levels are no joke. I consider myself as a person that can handle spicy and I was shockingly surprise of how spicy it was. If you can not handle spicy, I would steer you from getting any spice levels that contain ghost peppers. Besides that, the broth and noodles are rich in flavors. Portion size is very filling and not pricey compared to the other ramen places around.   The place was clean and service was welcoming right when we walked in to be seated. I would definitely add this place to one of my top ramen shops and I highly recommend you give this place a try.",

    "text": "I tried two other ramen places in Vegas's Asian district and decided to give Ramen Tatsu a try. The reviews on Yelp were promising and the menu had great prices for their ramen bowls. I had a very positive dining experience and will be going back.  Food 5/5: The noodles were the thick type which I love and the texture was perfect for me, cooked al dente. I tried the Tonkotsu and Tsukemen ramen. Both were great. The Tsukemen had a strong dashi-fish flavor to it, while the Tonkotsu was just pork-flavored. The egg was marinated and perfectly cooked soft-boiled. The charsiu was tender with a nice smoky taste.   Atmosphere/Vibe 4/5:  Cute and cozy interior with Japanese paraphernalia on shelves and art hung on the walls.  I came on a weekday late evening and there was no wait.    Price 5/5: The prices were $3-4 lower per bowl compared to many of the ramen places I've been to. I don't know why that is, but I'm not complaining.   Service/Cleanliness 5/5: The service was very attentive and our food was served quickly. Tables and restaurant were very clean and inviting.   Tip: I experience busy parking lots, parking problems and long waits when I go to ramen places during peak hours. It was only slightly later around 7 PM when I arrived at Ramen Tatsu, and there was plenty of parking and open tables.",

We took the fifteen-minute drive over and while the parking lot was packed, it didn't take long before we found a spot!  When we entered the atmosphere was nice and cozy, with small wooden toy houses lining the walls.  The traditional Japanese decorations made it homier.  We were seated quickly seeing that there were only two groups of people and looked through the menus.  We ordered three miso ramens and a Tonkatsu, along with two order of fried rice.  The order came in less than 15 minutes and the components in the bowls were plentiful and all complimented on our taste buds!",

I am not one to shy away from spicy, as I love the pain spicy food gives me. But let me tell you... their level 1 has got to be the top 3 spiciest things I have ever eaten in my life. I have tried the Last Dab Reduxx from hot ones (2,000,000 scoville units) and that was not as bad as the level 1 ramen at this place... holy crap. I still finished it though because despite it feeling like I was eating cut co knives, it was still very delicious. My waiter was extremely nice and friendly as well.",

The portion for the Miso was nice.   Interior is several tables, and wall booth style with accommodating table and chairs. Interior was very clean.   It does get very busy in here. But it is worth it. Everyone was very friendly and personable. Honestly I love great customer service.

We order gyoza (pot stickers) for our appetizer, spicy miso for our main course no sprouts with extra corn and an egg and when I'm really hungry I add extra noodles!   I can't express how satisfied I am with this place,  it's a calm but very cool and warm vibe. The food is on another level! The spice is my favorite ingredient it's unmatched.

I wanted to try the tsukemen, but when I ordered, they warned me that it smells very fishy.  My husband has an awful aversion to fish (long story), so I decided to avoid the potential disaster and ordered the miso ramen instead.  Husband ordered the tonkotsu.  We started on a happy hour pitcher of Asahi ($16), drinking out of strangely small glasses while we waited.  Tonkotsu Ramen Broth: Creamy and excellent. Noodles: Thin, but not quite right.  Not firm enough. Chashu: delicious!  Very flavorful. Egg: Standard, well cooked.  Miso Ramen Broth (pork/chicken blend): Extremely flavorful!  I could not taste any miso flavor as the broth was on the garlicky side, but still delicious. Noodles: Thick, yellow wavy.  Great!  They were like the chewy noodles typically served with tsukemen. Chashu and egg as above.  Overall, Tatsu is a solid choice for ramen in Vegas.  Although 5* ramen reviews from this ramen snob are hard to come by, I'd say Tatsu might be my favorite in town (so far).",

I actually came with the intentions of going to another restaurant in the plaza, but the wait was too long. I saw the good reviews on Yelp from this restaurant so I figured why not give it a shot!  My group of 7 ordered a variety of ramen. I personally had the tonkotsu because I like the thinner noodles. For appetizers, we tried the takoyaki and katsu. I loved the takoyaki! It was cooked fresh and served to our table in minutes. As far as ramen goes, the serving size is pretty big. A few people from our table ordered extra noodles and ended up giving a whole bowl to the table next to us because we were so full LOL. I would only recommend ordering extra if you're really hungry. The ramen was delicious, filling, savory, and everything I was looking for on this cold day.   I wish we had a place this good back home, because overall, I was very satisfied with my experience.",

When I entered Nanako greeted me right away and let me choose where I wanted to sit . I opted for a booth towards the back of the restaurant . She was my server and promptly got me water while I checked out the menu .  After she brought my water I just asked point blank what is your favorite thing and she was glad to help .  So I went with her pick of the Miso Soup and just request to make it spicy since it comes with her favorite type of toppings which includes yummy corn and bean sprouts and a variety of things plus pork belly . I went with the spicy heat level but they have a varying scale so you could even do challenges with friends here but I wanted to feel my face when I left so I went spicy .  Overall I loved this place from the decor to the service and the flavor and taste . I look forward to coming back with friends so I can try more stuff . I legit got soooo full but it was so yummy",

I got the Karaage appetizer and it was juicy and had a good amount of seasoning. The Tsukemen had a perfectly cooked egg. It was a cold dish with the broth on the side. Our table liked the Tonkatsu the best.    Overall a pretty standard ramen restaurant. The service was quick and the servers were friendly.",

While he enjoyed his meal, I thought mine had much to be desired. The chashu was a bit chewy, tough, and lacked flavor, and while the tonkotsu broth appeared creamy, it didn't really taste rich. It was somewhat reminiscent of Anime Ramen's tonkotsu and thats no compliment. The thin noodles and egg were fine, nothing bad to say.  The second time we visited, we both ordered plain miso ramen. The broth was very tangy and tasted rather thin. The thicker curlier noodles served with it were harder (not cooked long enough?) than I would've enjoyed. The chashu, again, was disappointing.   The service was good - it was just two waiters standing towards the back and watching the second anyone needed anything, seeing as how they recently opened, so I feel a bit bad giving them three stars. I think they'll get steady business regardless, however, since they're in a strip mall that also has that karaoke place and Cue D's.",

My favorite was the shoyu, the flavor was there, more subtle not salty.  Noodles are al dente and according to one of the waiters they are fresh made daily some place in California.  If we are to compare to the other Vegas notorious ramen place, I feel Monta's broth has become too diluted and salty for me. But Ramen Tatsu does feel a lot like Monta, if fact the chef seems to be the old one from Monta.  The cut of pork is thicker here and less marbled fat which I like.  Good, very friendly service.  Pleasant space to sit down and enjoy dinner, maybe not so much the style of a fast food bustling traditional Japanese ramen, but I like enjoying my beers while I eat and I don't mind this lack of authenticity.  Also a plus, there's never much of a wait here, but it's a new place.  I'll be coming back to Ramen Tatsu for my ramen fix.",

Well, until everyone else finds out how good this place is.   Definitely the ambience is much nicer since you don't have to look at people staring at you waiting for tables to open up.   They also offer excellent Gyoza and curry too.",

    "text": "Tatsu Ramien was an excellent experience. The ambiance reminded me of Ramen Houses in Northern Japan. The staff is friendly, accommodating, and allowed me to knock the dust off of my conversational Japanese.  The ramen was good to include the broth. I agree with most of the other reviews about the with of noodles. Make sure to specify the thickness you desire.  My wife and I found the \"wide noodle\" described on the menu not to be so \"wide.\"  All of the menu choices for the night was well worth it and was served promptly, still hot, and with the friendlyness that we have grown accustomed to while in Japan.   My wife and I enjoyed the meal with another couple. The total bill was under $70 dollars and we did not skimp on side dishes. We were all satiated, full, and satisfied.  The environment can accommodate both quick meals for singular people as well as groups. I would also feel comfortable taking my children to the restaurant.  Tatsu gets our \"enthusiastic thums up.\"  Go check it out for yourselves!",

I got the deluxe and my friend had the spicy miso. the broth was just okay. it lacked depth and a bit of flavor. ramen does come with excess amount of chirasu and other things to fill up the bowl. the thick noodle was let anything memorable. also ordered goyza and kiraage. goyza was whatevers but kiraage was above average. not too crispy and very juicy inside. I wanted to try the fried rice based on the reviews but didn't have room for it. overall, I don't know if I would come back here. I still prefer ramen sora as my number 1 ramen place followed by Monta ramen. it wasn't bad but not really worth going back.",

    "text": "I have been craving their tsukemen.  I have been to Monta and Sora in the last 4 weeks and I needed something different.  When I went there about a month ago, it was closed for renovation of some sort.  As it just opened not very long ago, I'm not sure what they needed to do.    When I arrived today, it didn't look much different at all, so I'm not sure why they've been closed, but anyway, I was stunned to find out that tsukemen has been eliminated from the menu.  As I believe that Monta and Fukumi are the places to go for tonkotsu, sora for miso, and tatsu for tsukemen, it was quite disappointing.    Anyway, I had tonkotsu as I just had monta last week and wanted to compare the two.    Let me just say that their ramen is good, but it's not the TYPE of tonkotsu that I like.  If you like shinsengumi in L.A., you will like their version of tonkotsu, but I personally favor more thicker, heavy tonkotsu flavor that you see in Monta or Daikokuya.    You do see variation in the tonkotsu flavor in Japan, and I'm not going to say that one is better than the other, but it comes down more to personal preference and this isn't the type of tonkotsu that I like, hence I'd say 3.5 stars.    I wonder if there wasn't enough demand for tsukemen to keep it on the menu?  but it is certainly a disappointment for me.",

I ordered the spicy ramen with pork bone marrow. It was delicious. After I finished my soda I just asked for water because it's $1.50 per soda can with no refills (which is kinda a bummer) other than that, it's a nice decor and it's a nice place.

    "text": "Short: Decent food, good prices, but didn't leave me super happy.  The long:  Have been meaning to hit this place for a while after seeing pretty good reviews. Arrived and was greeted warmly and told to sit anywhere. The place is littered with their \"Happy Hour\" special and a ad to add extra noodles. Otherwise the place is rather bland for a ramen shop; can't complain.   I was hungry, so I ordered the Deluxe ramen which has extra chashu (roasted pork slices), cabbage, bean sprouts, eggs, and corn on top of the normal toppings. Shoyu (soy sauce) broth with thinker noodles. Then I ordered a serving of karaage and (a surprise!) takoyaki. For $3 on happy hour for the sides, I wasn't expecting the amount of food I'd get for the sides; the karaage was a meal on its own with the chicken and side salad, and the takoyaki was small but had enough of them to feel worth it. Both were fine, not amazing. I've had better karaage at Fukumimi ramen. and better takoyaki at festivals, but not bad for the price.  As for the ramen: It's the worse I've had. I'm grading it against Monta and Sora ramen, so it's not terrible, but just doesn't make me rave. The broth isn't very complex and lacks punch. The chashu, while there was a lot, isn't very flavorful. The rest of the toppings on the ramen were simple and easy to add, but they didn't make this bowl feel like a \"Deluxe\" special from a ramen shop, more so a hodgepodge of toppings on decent ramen.   In the end, I left this place stuffed and content, but not very happy. The service is good, the prices are decent (Happy hour sides are great), the food is just lacking in overall flavor and depth.   I'll try this place again, but I suggest either Monta, Sora, Fukumimi, or Misoya Tomi ramen first.",

You know some Tonkotsu soup is very smelly and taste some kind of weird bitter flavor if you came across a ramen cooked by cooks who don't know the real Tonkotsu flavor.  Ramen soup is NOT built a day.  Certain trainings are required, enormous days and hours you have to spend to be a real Ramen cook.

    "text": "First off, we struggled to find this place at night.  That store sign is very difficult to read. Or we are just blind.  Place is very lovely looking and decorated to suit the theme.  Very similar to the other ramen houses.  Not too packed on a Saturday night.  Menu had several choices, but tonight we were aiming for spicy.  My friend got the spicy miso and a extra spicy for myself.  *Nice little check-in bonus (1 free drink).  Now the only complaint I have is that we have to add toppings?  I was a little confused since the description for my miso said ground beef.. So I added chashu.  My ramen obviously became expensive now.. Extra cost for extra spicy and chashu.  This bowl of soup better be worth it.   After several slurps, the spiciness  began to kick in.  Very good tasting broth, but I did not feel like it was anything special.  The spiciness was only a tad more than the regular.  The thick noodles were a nice change since we are used to getting thin types at the other places.  Service was excellent since our waitress was consistently coming around to see if we were doing okay.    Overall, this place is not bad in my book.  It just that there are plenty of ramen houses in this area.",

The service here was the main selling point. Our server was quirky, friendly, and in general seemed happy to be there. Of course this was during the non-busy hours, so that could change.  Overall it was delicious ramen with great service. The place isn't fancy but it did feel welcoming, so take that for how you will.  Also the portion sizes were good. My friend got a deluxe ramen and it was massive.",

I ended up getting a shio ramen and added an egg and kikurage (my favorite topping of all time).  I had never had this type of broth before, and it was light and fresh.  It reminded me of the broth that comes in a Cup of Noodles, and I mean that in a good way because I love Cup of Noodles.  My husband got a tonkotsu broth which was really rich, thick, and creamy.

They don't serve fountain drinks here, we were given our drinks in a can, so that was a bit of a turn off, but obviously nothing that would make me not want to eat at a place (haha).  I ordered the shoyu ramen and a side order of Katsu. Both of them were great and definitely worth the try. The portions were very good and I left there full. The other 2 in my party struggled to finish, so that's a great sign on my opinion. The ramen was very well priced and so were all of the sides.

    "text": "As a tonkotsu ramen aficionado, I'm constantly on the lookout for the next great ramen-ya, especially one that can rival the best in LA, or dare to dream, the ones in Hakata, Fukuoka, Japan. It was with great excitement that I noticed their preopening announcement, and we set out to try them for a weekend lunch. Upon entering the restaurant, we noted a clean Spartan aesthetic but the wooden benches were quite hard and mildly uncomfortable. The menu was simple and straightforward. We asked the waitress what the Tatsu ramen was, and she explained it is their tonkotsu with additional chashu (6 vs 2 pieces). We went ahead and ordered the tonkotsu ($7.77) and Tatsu ($10.77) ramen. Our bowls came out quickly and were accompanied by seaweed, ginger, a tiny bit of green onion and sesame, but no egg. Surprisingly, there didn't seem to be an option to add an egg, or other accompaniments, i.e. additional green onion, corn, etc. Interestingly, the shio and shoyu versions appear to come with an egg though.  While it looked promising initially with the proper thin white ramen noodles, our experience was underwhelming. First off, the noodles were overcooked and not al dente or firm enough. While the amount of noodles was adequate, the amount of broth was on the skimpy side and could have been served hotter. (Usually the better ramen joints serve their broth piping hot so that it is still plenty warm by the time you're finishing your meal.) The porky flavor and richness of the broth was ok but not something you would want to slurp up every last drop of. The chashu was not quite tender enough, a bit too fatty (that I was compelled to pick off the fatty parts), and somewhat bland at the same time. It was also odd that when I asked for shichimi togarashi (Japanese chili powder and a classic condiment), they only had chili oil available.  In the end, Ramen Tatsu was just okay for us. It is better than much of the local competition, but doesn't induce any cravings to return.",

We'll start with the good, the decor is simple with clean lines and they have a few items that I will be looking forward to in the future, such as karaage and takoyaki!  I love takoyaki, so if they get that going and it tastes good, I might just stop by for that by itself and a char siu bowl.  Now for the not so good, I tried the Tatsu Ramen which has a tonkatsu broth with 5-6 pieces of char siu and a piece of seaweed.  I felt everything was a little bland and under seasoned.  The soup base tasted slightly watery and could have used just a pinch of salt to bring the flavor out a little better.  I think this was a general consensus, since I heard the elderly couple next to us actually tell the waiter that they felt their Miso Ramen needed salt.  The pork belly was thicker cut, similar to Ramen Sora, but marbled in fat like Monta's.  However, again the pork lacked seasoning.  They also put the ginger in the bowl for you, instead of having on the side...which i dislike since ginger is pretty overpowering and a personal preference.  They also have the option of two different types of noodles, thick and thin.....I ordered the thick noodles and felt they were a little soggy already by the time I started eating....So unfortunately at this point, I will be returning to my old stomping grounds of Monta and Ramen Sora.",

When we got to Ramen Tatsu, there was a nice Japanese lady sweeping the front. We asked if they were open and she cheerfully said yes.  We walked in and we were the only customers here. By the time we left, however, more people came.  I ordered to tonkotsu shoyu ramen along with one of my friends. They cost $7.77. The other friend got the spicy miso, which was slightly pricier at a little over $8.  The same lady we saw sweeping the front also got us our drinks and took our order. She was really friendly, smiled a lot, and even took our picture for us.  Shame on me for forgetting to take a picture of my bowl of ramen, but it looked so good. I couldn't stop myself from digging right in.  The broth was tasty and had just the right amount of saltiness. The noodles were good as well. I just wish there was more pork. 2 slices isn't enough for such a big serving of ramen.  I'm adding Ramen Tatsu to my list of ramen spots. I like it even more because it seems it's owned and run by a family.",

There were 11 other people there and plenty of space for more.   Ramen was delicious. I got extra chasui and my friend went with an extra egg. Very very good. 4.5 easy for flavor.  Its funny when I look back at my starving college days of eating Top Ramen. I absolutely hated it but it was all I could afford. Now I find myself enjoying Ramen at the variety of places around town. Who knew???   This place is clean. A little slower with the food coming out than others, but that's ok. Service was really friendly. I'd eat here again.  Located in the same shopping area as Cafe Moda, District One, Chada Thai.....this is a great shopping area for foodies!!",

The ramen broth is cooked long and slow in a slew of veggies and bone broth so that it is nice and creamy. The noodles are the right consistency that slurp right off your spoon to your mouth. Even better, the egg was cooked to PERFECTION! Soft yolk, hard boiled white and the yolk had a tiny but of juice left but just oh so creamy in your mouth.  This place is a must try if you are craving ramen or if it's a gloomy day or cold day or any day for that matter of fact! I suggest adding an egg!!!",

    "text": "Food/Cost: We usually stop by the Asian BBQ restaurant next door but since it was closed for vacation we decided to come here. I'm glad we did! The Ramen were full of flavors where you know they have been boiling that pork bone for a long time! That was makes a True Ramen and not bland and make it up with lots of salt and MSG etc. Cost was very descent compared to many generic Ramen places. For the taste and flavors in this place, its more worth paying a little bit more anyway for the amount of time it takes to make the soup taste that way. The portion of kimchi fried rice we ordered was a bit small for the price we paid. Flavor was good but nothing to rave about. Has a bit of sour flavor too due to the Kimchi which was meh. Will think twice before ordering that again though. I would just stick with the Ramen. Haven't tried the other stuff though.   Service: The one and only lady I see working works like a champ! The place is small but enough capacity where I think it will really help to have 2 people. She took orders, brought your food, refill waters without you even asking and get your check. Even with all that by herself, she was still quick at her service. Wow! It wasn't until toward the end, we saw another lady walked out to help. I hope she was just taking a little break because otherwise, the heck you will leave a partner in chaos by herself?  Ambiance: Cute little place with the generic Japanese theme. Not much decor but enough to get the idea your at a Japanese restaurant. Place is clean and AC was good enough to bring the mood to eat hot soupy Ramen at 105F outside!",

They only have one waiting on all tables and greeting customers to their table. Because of this, service is super slow. You have to wait quite some time to be seated (they don't clean right away after someone leaves), some time for them to take your order, and some time to get your check.  For that -1 star.  With this restaurant being busy and popular especially in this plaza, it would be helpful if they could have one more person working.   The last visit, the meat and egg really disappointed me. The meat was chewy and not tender and was filled with fat and skin instead of meat.  The soft boiled egg was a bit over cooked as you can see from the yolk. The spoon had black marks on it and was dirty. For that -1 Star.   For something I initially enjoyed and would've given 5 stars, I was quite disappointed in my last two visits. Nonetheless I will return and hope to see improvements.",

There were mini crafts displayed on the walls of all the little buildings. I liked it a lot! I like crafts. Lol but when the gyoza came back it was perfect and we did t even need sauce with it. :) they even removed it from our bill without us having to mention it.

One of the better ramen places we've tried in Vegas would definitely come back the next we are in town.",

(I was here with my daughter in-law who lived in Japan a couple years) We also had great fried rice, and excellent shumai dumpling. The curry Ramen I ordered was a hint of curry broth, pork and vegetables excellent if you like a light curry taste, this is not creamy.   Everything that I saw brought out was appealing. Personally I would try it all.  Service was quick because it seems that it is a family owned restaurant, therefore they care. I would say if you can be there before traditional 12 noon for lunch ,  and 6:30pm for dinner it is probably better since it is a small place.  Bon Appetite!",

    "text": "We found Tatsu by accident, because we were originally going to the shabu shabu place next to it but they weren't open yet. It was happy hour (3-6pm M-F) so we got some chicken karaage and gyoza for $3 instead of the usual $4.75/order. Both things were good, with the chicken being flavorful and the gyoza nice and crispy on the edges.   There are many options on the menu, including rice bowls. We ordered the deluxe ramen (egg, corn, bean sprouts, cabbage, seaweed, green onion, charsiu, thick noodles) and asked if we could get it with miso broth instead of the tonkotsu broth it usually comes with. Our waitress said yes, but neglected to mention that it was $1 extra. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to know. The miso broth was okay but nothing to write home about. It tasted a bit watered down to me; I've had stronger, more flavorful miso broth from a packaged ramen from the Asian grocery.  What I did enjoy was the ample amount of vegetables that came with the ramen, as it made for a texturally interesting bowl. The charsiu was tender but oddly cold in the middle, as were the egg halves.   In short, Tatsu is a solid ramen shop if you're in the area, and they have a decent happy hour.",

    "text": "With all of the ramen there is in Chinatown now--it's hard to really find some good joints.   This place was pretty good. We wanted to find a new ramen place other than the usual spots.  It was pretty hoppin' for a Sunday early dinner. Which is always a good sign.  They have great prices and a pretty good selection of ramen.  I, myself, always love Miso broth. So I got the Miso Ramen and had them add an egg. It was really good. The broth was excellent.  They weren't my favorite noodles. They weren't as thick as I was hoping or as firm. Not perverted. Also, the pork here isn't the most tender. I love my pork in ramen to be very tender to where it falls apart easily. Otherwise, your face is over your ramen bowl and you're trying to tear it to peices without making a mess. Or you have to stuff the entire peice in your mouth and look like an idiot while you're eating...or you just look savage as fuck. So, depending on how you like your ramen--it will determine your experience, of course.   And I must say, the service here was excellent. All of the staff were very friendly and very upbeat. Our waitress was super happy and literally sang to us the names of what she was serving us. It made all of us laugh and enjoy our dinner much more. That's one thing that we don't see at the other ramen joints. Most of them are \"get in and get out\".   Overall, this place was pretty good. I'll definitely go back to try some other type of ramen.",

We ordered The Veggie Ramon with mushroom, corn, bean sprout, green onion and we added cabbage. You can dial up the spice. I'm a wimp so mine was zero and my wife was medium. First bite.... really tasty!! The combination of flavored blend very well! Spicy update!! My wife said Number 4 spice level is Spivey but also damn good!!

The ramen here is out of this world-- Monta does not even come close to comparing. The broth is incredible (I always get the Shoyu and add an extra egg) and the noodles taste fresh. Pricing is awesome (around $7-8 for a bowl of fresh ramen), most include pork, egg and onion, and the portion sizes are great.  I can't appreciate ramen anywhere besides Ramen Tatsu anymore because of how good it is. The woman who waits on the tables and runs the register (i assume shes the owner and I've only ever had one server there) is also super polite, attentive, warm and welcoming.

So when we got in we noticed tsukemen wasn't anywhere on the menu. The waitress told us that when they received the noodles for the tsukemen it was the wrong kind and will be another month of so till they the new noodles. Not sure what rake so long to get different noodles.   So we decided to just try the regular ramen and it was full of disappointment. May have been the worst ramen I had.   We ordered the smoked chasu to share and I got the Tonkatsu shoyu ramen with garlic chip and egg add-ons.   Smoked chasu was very flavorful and delicious. Meat quality was decent and the spicy sauce and the garlic on the side was a nice addition. Now on to the ramen.   The broth - very light, kind of bland, and had a weird aftertaste.   Noodles -  wasn't bad, wasn't great. I prefer the thinner noodles for Tonkatsu shoyu normally but decided to try it with thick since that is what they normally serve with this ramen  Chasu - the chasu in the ramen is of worse quality than the smoked chasu. It is probably some of the worst chasu I have had in ramen. Just looking at it you can tell the meat is of subpar quality.   Garlic chips - I liked the crunchiness of the chips, but seemed a little overcooked to me.   Service was good though and the workers were very friendly and that's the reason for the 2 stars.",

They seem to be a different style of ramen than to Sora's Sapporo style, yet they are pretty good for the price that they offer.

My uncle and I came here because our favorite place, Yagyu, closed down. My recent visit I actually ordered Tsukemen. I don't believe I have ever tried tsukemen before, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I was pleasantly surprised with my order. With tsukemen, your noodles come out on the side, and you dip the noodles into a broth that's thicker and more flavorful than regular ramen broth.  They allow you to order 3x or more noodles servings for just a few bucks more; I went with 2x. Noodles are thicker than typical ramen and very chewy which I normally don't like for ramen, but went very well with tsukemen. Toppings included the standard chashu, egg, etc., and a wedge of lime. There seems to be only one kind of broth for the tsukemen, which I believe was tonokotsu shoyu with bonito. I'll have to get the tsukemen again the next time I'm visiting Vegas!",

Their chicken karage also uses high quality big chunks of meat. For the tsukemen I recommend adding extra scallions and the garlic chips for flavor but the dipping sauce is already awesome by itself. They also have some great little art designs on their wall. Highly recommend!",

Side story: I've been trying to find a good tsukemen place ever since I've tried the best tsukemen place back home on Hawaii. I've been craving it and good tsukemen is hard to find. Tsukemen is basically a dish that you dip noodles in thick tasty broth. Its really delicious. Back to the review: we came to ramen tatsu and the restaurant was 3/4 full of people. We waited a couple minutes and were seated. There was only one server but I have to say, she was on it. We ordered and it only took 5 minutes to get our food. It was very tasty and the portions given was a good amount. I only ate half and packed a to go container for home. I would definitely recommend people to try it if your looking for a different style of ramen!",

Ramen Tatsu might as well have been airlifted from Japan and deposited in Las Vegas.  I had the spicy tonkatsu - amazing!  Just the right amount of spiciness so that your nose runs a little, and the perfect tonkatsu flavor.  They also have Asahi on draft, which paired well with the ramen.

At first my daughter and I was unsure about the other reviews because we were not sure if mainlanders idea of ramen is the same as HAWAII people's ideas.   Well let me tell you HAWAII people and all people with taste buds, this place is ONO!  So if you from our beautiful islands, you can rest assured this is a great place to get ramen.   Don't forget to get charsu cause it is one of the best charsu that I've eaten in all of my life. And that's saying a lot as I don't really care for pork. The outside has a little crisp and the jelly like heat reduced fat. Ummm. Sound like an oxymoron to say it wasn't oily fat, just ono.   Go try them.

When you enter the restaurant, you're almost instantaneously greeted by the server. Usually, they only have one on duty, but they always provide stellar service (and they're always really nice!).  When it comes to the food, I have absolutely no complaints. Their ramen is great. I've had them all (even the vegetarian one which is surprisingly good). They have the perfect level of richness and creaminess without it being too overwhelming and the broth isn't overly salty. Their curry is also pretty tasty and very filling. Their menu has decent variety and happy hour appetizers are a great deal.  Totally recommend this is as a very chill and casual ramen joint.",

Once you walk in it's very small and quaint, but I liked it. You can tell it's a cozy, little business. The service was outstanding. Super attentive and very helpful with answering any questions.   When it came down to eating I decided to try the tonkotsu soyu ramen with egg added. The noddles arrived quickly, hot & fresh. I really enjoyed the flavor of the broth and thought all the toppings were equallevenly distributed. I did have to ask for hot sauce to add a bit more spice, but overall it was very tasty.   I'll definitely be back here again soon. Their happy hour specials looked awesome too!",

    "text": "So my favorite spot Misoya closed down and idk why but I heard it failed an inspection? Anyways   This place had high ratings so I brought my ramen partner and drove here. 4.5 stars? Can't go wrong! The interior was very appealing with lots of Christmas decorations for the season. There was one floor person who was seating and serving at least 20 people. Kudos to her.  This ramen spot is in a very busy plaza outside of China town that includes J Karaoke, Chada Thai, District 1, and Chinese BBQ AKA parking sucks on the weekend.  Their menu includes more than just ramen: appetizers, curry, and other Japanese dishes.   I got their karaage and gyoza to start and for my ramen I chose their deluxe ramen with all the fixings. At $10.99 it was a very reasonable price. This includes 3 slices of chashu, corn, cabbage, and some sort of fungus. Basically I didn't dig the broth. I haven't been to many ramen places to compare: Fukumimi, Monta, Misoya, And Jimya. Personally it just didn't have as much flavor and it just didn't taste good to me. I can see it appealing to certain people but my idea of ramen was not this. The chashu was flavorful, but not fall apart delicious.  As a saving grace their gyoza was extremely delicious. This was a stand out for me. The karaage was pretty good too but nothing to write home about.   Service was okay/sweet, prices are about the same as everywhere, space/environment was nice, but ramen was just okay.  I would return to try a non-ramen dish, but I'm not in a hurry.",

You can pretty much customize your ramen by adding \"extras\" or omit whatever you don't like. And, If you love eating your ramen with hot mustard, like me, don't be afraid to ask for it. They have a delicious Japanese mustard that complements your ramen  Definitely my new fave spot!",

We both got extra noodles but ended up not eating them, as there were tons of noodles in our bowls to begin with!   For apps we had a small fried rice and the gyoza. Both were in point but came 15 seconds before our ramens, so I didn't get to spend as much time on them.  I will say that both ramens came with kikurage mushrooms by default and I could have done without them. The texture was a little too stiff for my liking.   Definitely would recommend for a place to get away from the high prices of the strip!",

    "text": "X marks the spot when it comes to good service, here at Ramen Tatsu. I arrived at opening time this past Sunday (02/12 at 11:30), and was greeted by a young, very bright and enthusiastic female server, who told me I could sit anywhere; I chose the booth closest to the door.   She immediately placed a full water glass and menu on my table, then went about some other duties. When I was ready to order she magically appeared and efficiently took my order, repeated it back to me for confirmation and whisked away to the back with my menu in tow. All the while, more customers were filing in to the place, and she didn't miss a beat with any of them.   In good time, she returned with a steaming bowl of miso ramen and a small plate of chahan (I chose regular fried rice over kimchi fried rice). The chahan was decent, with a nice bit of wok flavor (I dropped the left over chahan at my mother's, and she thought it was excellent), and the miso ramen was just what I needed after a couple days of hard driving. The broth was hot, flavorful, with firm noodles, plenty of bean sprouts, corn, green onion and chasshuu. While it wasn't as good as a bowl of Misoya Tomi's miso ramen (they're actually closed now), it was pretty dang good. The highlight of the dish was the chasshuu, with excellent flavor in the lean part, and of course, a lot of flavor on the fatty part, which was plentiful.   After drinking the bowl dry, I pushed the bowl away and almost immediately after, the server dropped the check at my table, and asked me if I wanted a box for the left overs. When she returned with the box, she parted with a warm/polite \"thank you\".   The industry needs more servers like her. I hope this server, and many more like her, decide to make it their role in life to do this job, and do it well - especially in small, hole-in-the-wall places like Ramen Tatsu. Who knows, maybe she's the owner, and if so, thank God.",

But my ear was clogged up for three days and the head cold was just hanging out.  It needs to leave.  Ramen Tatsu to the rescue!  In the morning, my ear finally drained.  I can hear!  This is just my take on their soup.  I do love it.  It's affordable and tastes really good.  I don't leave leftovers.  I have my fave ingredients for my cold remedy I suppose.  It works so I'll stick with it.  How's that?  :)",

I was able to enjoy watching a NFL game while having dinner.  The staff is super nice! They made sure we were well taken cared off and followed up with us to make sure everything was ok.  Let's get down with the food! I had the Katsu Curry! I know i know why order Katsu Curry at a Ramen joint but the picture in the menu got me! I knew I had to try it! The bowl was huge and the curry was not too spicy! The chicken was juicy and crust had a nice texture.   Overall I enjoyed this place! I liked that it was intimate and staff gave great service.",

    "text": "I love eating Japanese ramen noodles no matter what time of year it is. Sure, that goes for any delicious soup out there, but some of my friends think I'm weird eating hot soup on a hot summer day. I went to a place once and they only serve ramen during the winter season - Boo!  My favorite broth here is their tonkotsu infused with shoyu. Love this savory and somewhat creamy broth without being too salty. What a wonderful option that I am able to choose thin or thick noodles with my soup. They give you good portions of noodles unlike other places that skimp on it. Depending on the soup you order, it comes with basic toppings and add ons are extra charge.  I'm not sure if I come here because of their soup or because they have one tasty fried rice and chicken karage that pair well together. I love the condiments on the table which add flavor to the chicken karage as a dipping sauce.   The service here is always excellent even when it's usually one gal working solo in the dining area. The older lady is my favorite server. She's cute and always has positive energy when she's serving my table. I love how this place is so warm and inviting! I like seeing the wall decor they put up and the dark wood throughout adds warmth.   This place also has a family friendly atmosphere compared to other ramen joints where lots of hipsters hang out and therefore tends to be noisy. This place is smaller than the other ramen joints around the valley. That's another reason why I like to dine here giving it a more personal space while I slurp my savory bowl of goodness.",

The chasiu was still cold...not rich and delectable at Monta.  The Katsu was dry and the curry was too thin.  This ramen shop is more spacious than Monta and the service was good.    Also, they do not have that spicy seasoning on the side, or the jar of pickled radish or pickled ginger on the table to add to your soup/entree as other places do.  Overall, it is ok, but not enough for me to return.",

I knew coming to Vegas where there were many ramen choices, that I had to try the real thing. Sora and Monta seemed to be the #1 and 2 places for ramen. However, this place had great reviews and I wanted to try somewhere that wasn't the most popular. Wanted to give the little guys a chance.   We ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu and Curry. Both were tasty but the Curry was our favorite. The broth was amazing. I still think about the broth and want some right now! It tasted homemade, flavorful and fresh. No complaints at all about the food.  I don't remember our server's name, but she was an older lady. She was very kind and on top of everything. She gave us great service.  I was overwhelmed here in Chinatown with all the choices. Glad I chose this place.",

Coming into this small corner shop that is in a busting popular shopping center from the cold was a delight. The shop is full of homely decor, and while we visited full of Christmas knicknacks. The staff were kind and sweet, making sure we were comfortable. Even though it was just my boyfriend and I the insisted we switched to a larger table to more comfortable. So sweet ! Once we got our menus we were drooling! Not only did everything look good but it was bang for your buck! Usually, Sora is my top choice for cheaper ramen but these prices blew it out of the water. Not only that but once we ordered our ramens, I the Shio and my bf the Tonkotsu Shoyu we were amazed. These blew Sora's out of water for us. Their eggs were much better seasoned, a big swing for us. Their broth was incredibly more flavorful. We also got some gyoza, another favorite of ours. It was very tasty, the searing making it just the perfect type of crispy. It was a bit too garlicy for me but I overall enjoyed the appetizer. This place surely will be our spot for cheap ramen and trust me the taste will not be cheap at all!",

I guess I must have been starving or I just need a side of extra noodles.  Overall, I liked Tatsu ramen and I'm hoping they reopen soon.

It was my first time trying this type of ramen since I've already tried all the other ramen places in town (Monta, Sora) and I would definitely come back to have tsukemen again! They have the regular order for $10.77 and a double noodle order for $12.77. I got the regular order and when I finished my noodles and still had plenty of broth left I regretted not doing the double noodles order :( the broth was so good, I really wanted to sip on it but alas it's too salty without the noodles.  The charsiu that accompanied it was soft and delicious.  We also ordered the kaarage and it was seasoned just right, crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. The mister had the miso ramen with butter and he devoured his bowl. He also complimented on how great the charsiu was! He also finished the broth in his bowl so that says something since he's normally not a soup person!  They also serve green tea (iced or hot), that does not come out of a can and you get free refills.  Overall we had a great lunch! Would definitely return!",

I have only tried two out of several broths (Shio and Tonkotsu Shoyu) and I love the lightness of the soup. Its not over buttered and doesn't feel so heavy. It doesn't leave that fatty taste at the end of the meal. I also love the noodles which are cooked to perfection. The chashu pieces are thicker than most places and tastes like real pork that you can actually chew on and enjoy the flavor.  The takoyaki is also good with just the right amount of  batter and crunch. I love how they dont add too much mayo. Beautiful little babies! The restaurant is spacious and the music they play is relaxing and smooth and adds a cafe feel to it.  They also have curry and a saborro bowl which i have yet to try. Definitely need to try this place out! The service is also amazing. They replace your water before you run out and they are really nice and friendly. And I love how its not as crowded and busy as monta or sora but they its not an empty restaurant.",

I like a little yuzu refreshing taste in the soup. I wish the broth was a little hotter because the ramen turned cold quickly. The noodles were firm. I prefer the noodles a bit chewier and have more bite. Tatsu is generous with their portion and toppings. I added bean sprouts and kimchi on the side. It was such a steal for .77 cent for so much toppings.",

I've tried other ramen places before and this one didn't really stand out to me. Maybe my taste buds don't really find salty soup appetizing. I personally prefer the beef broth in pho. I also got the chicken karange (I'm pretty sure that's not how you spell it) and I thought it was just alright - I've had better ones before. Why I'm giving this place 4 stars is simply because of my server. She did an amazing job. She was wearing the best accessory anyone could have - her extremely contagious smile. She was like that with all her customers which obviously made up for my salty food. If you prefer ramen over pho, then I'm sure you'll enjoy this Japanese Restaurant.",

    "text": "Not a long wait like monta!!  My friend and i decided to check out a ramen place we havent gone to in vegas before heading home.  This place didnt have a wait and we were seated right away.   Their menu is pretty simple-  ramen choices, some appetizers and rice plates.  The 3 stars is purely for the one of the better curry's i've had. The curry almost reminds me of this meat sauce but curry flavored! They have ground meat in the curry that adds more texture and flavor to the rice plate.   The ramens were so-so. Soup base is definitely better at monta imo, but if you're hungry and hungover for some soup and dont want to tolerate the long wait at monta, this place might be a good idea.",

Thus compares just fine to both in terms of the broth, yum! I like the noodles that came with my spicy tonkatsu just fine, but not a fan of the noodles that came with the plain tonkatsu. Service was very good.",

    "text": "My first time at Tatsu, we had Gyoza, miso ramen and spicy Tonkotsu ramen. Everything was amazing!!! Especially cha-shu pork ( of course hose made!), it's melt in your mouth. Miso ramen was so tasty, it is hard to find really good miso ramen. I have tried so many miso ramen because it's my favorite :) but they usually tasted like miso soup, or no flavor... Miso ramen at Tatsu is very flavorful, if you like authentic Japanese ramen, you must try Tatsu! I also loved their Maneki-Neko collection. They are so cute!!!",

Noodles are nice and al dente, and the charsiu was soft and tasty. Compared to our most horrible ramen ever at Itsy Bitsy Ramen and Whiskey the other week, Ramen Tatsu wins hands down. Oh wait, not forgetting to mention that the one, single waitress in there during dinner rush, with her cutesy Japanese accent... she was on it, she single handedly bussed and served and checked people out, was very quick while carrying hot bowls of ramen. She was very polite never forgetting to greet and thank all the customers! We're going back again.",
