Service was very good and the place is clean and near my house. I ordered the Asada enchilada combo with green sauce... Had a nice kick to it and was delicious!! I am picky about food but this place absolutely rang the bell for me. The rice and beans are normally a throw away... Not this time... I slicked the plate clean! Do a check in and get a free churro.  Like Arnold said, \"I'll be back\" My only reason for 4 stars vs 5 is that the plastic utensils are worthless.... They cannot even cut the enchilada...",

My boyfriend said he was taking me somewhere to eat after Costco this morning and this is where we needed up at. The area is a bit out of the way for me but it's well worth it. I had no idea what to order but my boyfriend had mentioned all their tortillas are handmade. He mentioned the Gordita combo and it sounded great so that's what I ordered. He ordered menudo. Available on weekends.   The Gordita combo comes with beans and rice,a Gordita which is like a sandwich and a taco. For the taco I got Barbacoa and the Gordita I ordered carne asada. The Gordita was stuffed with meat, beans and cheese along with lettuce tomato and sour cream. The bread in the Gordita was perfectly fresh and soft. The taco was dripping with meat juice from the Barbacoa and the tortilla was fresh and hot. Beans and rice were standard but well done. Boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his menudo and even though I'm not a fan, I appreciated the fact that it wasn't swimming in oil and fat. They offer salsas by the register. There were three to choose from. Green salsa verde standard, a red sauce not very spicy but garlicky and delicious and a creamy orange sauce super spicy I'm guessing it was habanero. I ate a bit of it then switched to the red one because I couldn't handle anymore. The red one was overall my favorite because it had a very nice garlic flavor to it that I loved. We'll  definitely be back, my pregnant taste buds appreciated every morsel and my picky palate is hard to satisfy these days.",

The first thing that has impressed us both times as we've walked in was the overwhelming friendliness of the staff. You are literally made to feel like family. I'd be hard-pressed to name another place where everyone there is so cheerful, helpful, and friendly. It's like they honestly enjoy working there, lol.    Friendliness is nice, but if the food sucks, I'm still not coming back. We've tried 4 different combos, and they all rocked. Last time I got the burrito, and this time I got the quesadilla (stomach is still a little tender coming off Hawaiian fish food poisoning). Both were really good. BF is hooked on the gordita. We both got a churro last time- we got the nice surprise that they are caramel churros- even better than they sound. Unfortunately their flan is so popular that they were out last time, but I got some today- I don't think I've ever come across a flan that was creamier than this is.     The decor is pleasant and the environment definitely matches the theme.    I think what pushed it over the edge was how incredibly nice they were to me in helping me out with my tender stomach- this was the first solid food meal I've had since the food poisoning, and by far this was the right place to go to.    Thanks, Ladies. We'll be seeing you soon   :)",

The cashier  (could of been the owner, with the passion & pride she showed for ingredients and menu items) was very welcoming, and after quick chitchat finding out we were new customers she was very informative on ingredients and preparation for items we picked.  I wasn't quite sure about the combination of ingredients for my shrimp burrito. It was great. It can't be compared to other shrimp burritos I've had in the area because Abuela's shrimp burrito has a different flavor combination that's refreshingly different and it does make other shrimp and rice burritos seem plain. As for what my family had, I can't remember. We didn't share and no leftovers. Lol.  I wish We would've tried Abuela's sooner.",

I'd give 3.5 stars if I could. GREAT food different from similar places and friendly service too but rating 3 stars instead of 4 bc waiting 20 minutes was kinda sorta ridiculous. will definitely be back sometime when i get a chance!!",

The only reason I'm not giving more stars is because the asada was really tough and gristly -- both times.  They use cheap meat.  Great horchata & great salsa!!",

The carne asada was of good quality beef for the price, unlike other places that used cheap greasly beef. The shrimp tacos are made with deep fried breaded shrimp which I did not know because they aren't advertised as such, but they were still good. All in all they were good tacos, for a fair price.",

The quesadilla was also wonderful with it's fresh tortilla.  The staff were older ladies, very friendly.  I can't wait to go back.",

This place is by far the best Mexican taco shop in town! And I mothereffing love Mexican food with a passion. Add to the fact that it's a mom 'n pop place, with all abuelas cooking in the kitchen? The tortillas are hand made, all soft, warm, and will make you salivate more. The fish taco is a reason to venture out to this east LV location alone. The gorditas are super filling, I had the chicharone one last time, and it nearly put me in a food coma driving away. The carne asada is juicy, flavorful, and not dry/overcooked like at other places, I love homemade refried beans and this goes right up there with my favorite beans in town from Pepe's Tacos. The only thing I didn't love about this place are the tortilla chips. They weren't bad, I've just had getter chips elsewhere or at home. But you know what? It's a freaking tortilla chip. No big deal. Well worth the visit.",

My food was ready very quickly...I made it home, propped up on the couch with my tacos and OMG!!!!! They were AMAZINGLY GOOD!!! The best I ve had since moving from Los Angeles. The fresh tortillas, perfectly seasoned, fresh meats, pico de gallo.....everything was right on point. I will DEFINITELY be going back OFTEN!!! Abuelas Tacos gets 2 thumbs up and a HIGH FIVE!!!!! I totally recommend them :)",

But the carne asada meat is bland and not juicy.   The taco is pretty much tasteless and dry. I \"think\" (not 100% sure) its because they cooked a big batch whenever and just let it sit there, unlike other taco places.   $2.50 per taco (decent price for the size), but I can get with the same price, better seasoned, and freshly cooked carne asada meat with \"Guacamole\" at Pepe's or Tacos El Gordo- and they cook the meat there when they get orders and not make big batch.",

She was very pleasant and informative when I asked her what they put in the tacos. The first thing she said was that the tacos are not spicy and they don't put sauce in them.  What a relief ! !! Anywho, I got the number one which is your choice of any two tacos, plus a side of rice and beans, and a drink.  This meal only set me back 7 dollars. The corn tortillas are home made and they are the best tortillas you will ever eat. I got a fish taco and a taco de asada.  After picking off the cilantro, I dug in. Both tacos were delicious!  The fish and asada were perfectly seasoned(not salty), the rice was not soggy, and the beans were so fresh. I checked in on Yelp so that I could get a free churro with my combo meal. My only complaint is that they don't make their own juices. If you want authentic Mexican food, go to Abuela's Tacos. I promise you won't be disappointed. The food is just like how grandma used to make it. Not my grandma, but somebody's grandma",

I ordered the california burrito and was disappointed in the amount and quality of fries that were included.  Next time, I won't order fries in my burrito.  But the asada was tasty!  I also tried the veggie burrito and it tasted super clean and non-meaty.  I enjoyed how much pico, sour cream guac and cheese were included in the bean/veggie burrito!  Salsa was also on point!  It was garlicky and fresh!  Prices were approximately $6-7.50 a burrito.  They charge you when you add additional items like sour cream and guac.  Still not bad.  I'd come back here.",

The asada was made right and the chicharron verde fabulous. Try the flan before leaving. The ladies are real Abuelas making the food. You want to know the real deal, come to Abuelas.",

My husband and I never heard of Abuela's before, we were just hungry and saw this on our way home. We stopped in and it smelled so good inside. Like our moms kitchen. We order our daughter a Quesadilla de Lengua and I got a carnitas burrito and my husband got a burrito of barbacoa.  Let me tell you that my daughters quesadilla was so bomb. I wished that she didn't finish it so I can finish for her. It was amazing. It came out hot and cheesy. The cheese was so good.  My burrito was also yummy. The size was perfect and it didn't fall apart.  We went back and I got a Gordita de Chicharron and language taco. I loved the Gordita. You can tell they make everything from scratch.  The Lengua was tender and juicy. My husband and I are always pleased and are surprised that we don't go there as often.   I really like the fact I always see women working the kitchen in a lot of Mexican restaurants it's always men. I feel like it puts a \"motherly touch\" in our food ^.^",

So when I stepped foot inside this joint, I was hoping I wouldn't have to do the same.  I ordered the asada quesadilla combo and  my husband ordered the asada tacos. We additionally ordered one shrimp taco, fish taco, and a side of fresh guacamole. All the food was very appetizing and full of flavor with the exception of the guacamole. It was too bland for my liking but I shouldn't knock down a star for that.  Overall we were very satisfied with our order. We will be coming back again to try out the other items on the menu.

Churros are hit and miss-and this wasn't Disneyland or Costco standard to me. But heck it's a churro...what should matter is the real food. So maybe I should really rate this place 4 stars.   You do get the option of what meat to get: chicken, asada, chicarron, fish, shrimp, & there was additional however I can't recall. The combos range from tacos, gorditas, quesadilla, a bowl, and carne asada fries. Combos come with a drink and chips & salsa or rice & beans. I think the next time I come back I'll try the asada fries.",

I have had most of the menu and have yet to be disappointed. The spices they use on the meats can only be found in grandmas kitchen and that's where I am reminded when I eat at this place. Although this place is small the food is one of the best I have had in Las Vegas. This is definitely a place I recommend to anyone who is looking to have a one of a kind experience in this town along with great food.",

    "text": "I want to give abuela's tacos 3.5 stars, 3 stars seemed too low so i gave them a 4.I feel like i had a bit of a roller coaster experience. I came on a saturday night around 6pm and it was packed. The sole motivation for my group was to give these hot cheetos tacos a try. After placing my order despite the long line, my food came out right away, which was steange because there were at least 5 people before me that still hadn't gotten their food. We let this slide because it seemed as though they were slightly understaffed. But lets talk THE FOOD. The carne asada itself to me was delightful, not too fatty, full of flavor. But the letdown to me was the hot cheetos shell. We all felt as though it was red food coloring. There was no heat, there was no flavor, it may as well have been a normal tortilla shell. Then they advertise if you give a yelp review you get a free churro. Don't waste your excitement. It was hard, only had cinnamon on one side and lacked flavor. I was disappointed because they tried to step out of the box and weren't able to commit. I think if you are in the mood for a chip shell you are better off going with the doritos taco at taco bell. Sure your meat won't be anywhere as good as abuela's but at least you will get what you were expecting. OVERALL, i would come back for a regular meal because the PRICES were great i payed $8 for two tacos rice beans and a drink! so i say i'm 50/50 on this one.",

I got my food very quickly which was a plus but when I opened my enchiladas they were tomato red not like the normal dark red almost burgundy sauce that I'm used too. I still tried it and was disappointed that it had cojita cheese inside instead of mozzarella or shredded cheese that I'm used to.  I took my plate back up and told the girl at the desk that I didn't like it and could I have tacos instead she yes and told me it would be 9.50 I said ok and paid her. I loved the tacos but I just though it was really weird that she made me pay for them even though I took the enchiladas back. Nowhere in the Restaurant does it state what kind of cheese is in the tacos. Otherwise I wouldn't complain. Didn't have the best experience but would try other things on the menu Injust know to ask what kind of cheese is in certain items.",

The chorizo was tasty, egg was minimal. Thought the food i ordered was \"OK\" at best. I'd rather eat at pepe's tacos.",

Of Course the flautas were more. After she argued with me and rolled her eyes, they brought out the right order a few minutes later. And I didn't get the refund on the cheaper plate.

We got a free churro for yelp check in, it was too hard and there wasn't enough sugar..  I thought Abuela would replace Roberto in our hearts.....lol i guess not. Might come back to try other stuff on their menu though.  PS: free horchata refills here!",

The 1st time I ordered the cheese enchiladas with verde sauce(mind you it was real mexican cheese!!!! Yummy).  I am hard to choose meat my 1st time into a place, until I can taste my man's order :) He ordered the Carne Asada Bowl.  The Carne Asada was the BEST I have had in Vegas....probably any taco shop. It was well marinated and melted in your mouth tender.  They come with chips, salsa and a drink. Great combo (Or I guess you could have tortillas also) So my next visit in I thought...I have to try the Carne Asada, so I had the carne asada buritto, with chips/salsa and a drink, my man again had the bowl.  I was so happy, it was as good as the 1st time. The burrito is perfect. Beans, rice and carne asada...LOVE it!   The 3rd time I ordered to go, 2 carne asda burritos, chips/salsa, 2 drinks. I was sad. The meat was not as tasty, had fat and grizzle, had to take out a few pieces from my mouth...that is the one thing I cannot do. The 4th time I went... I went on a saturday.  It was busy as I expected it to be. I ordered a carne asada quesadilla, I thought I would try the meat one more time.  My order got lost and I finally went up to ask when it was coming out and they said the ticket wasnt there so they would get on it, this was after about 15 mins or so of waiting.  Then another 10 minutes and it finally arrived. :( sad again.  Meat was nothing like it was the 1st two times I went.   The service is great except for the Saturday.   I love the beans, rice, salsa, chips, and enchiladas...so I think I will stick to those items.  It is just so hard to find carne asada the way it was our 1st two visits... If it stayed like that... this place would be impossible to get into because it was delicious.  I do however want to try the barbacoa...that is hard to get perfection as well...but I am going to try. Great job ladies...delicious food!  Went today (11.7.17) had the barboca bowl with chips and salsa, but ordered 2 tortillas on the side...my man had the Carne asada tacos...he loved the tacos but he really loves the bowl...my barboca was delicious...cooked to melt in your mouth perfection!  As I said before...I am just super picky about my meat but this truly is the best Carne asada I have ever had and the barboca is something I would definitely order again!!!",

She explained to me in detail what any item was specifically when I had asked about them and never pressured me to \"hurry\" and make a decision. I had purchased a breakfast burrito and a bowl of menudo. Upon completing my purchase I was told that the food would be brought to me vs having a number called out or my name like fast food restuarants. Extremely happy about that and the young man who brought my entrees to my table was very respectable and made sure I didnt need anything else and if I needed condiments he told me where I could get them. AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE! The food now was amazing as well, I checked to make sure the burrito was cooked thoroughly and it was and tasted each individual part of the menudo. I had no complaints when I left I highly recommend this place at any given time!!!! You know what Im going right now to get me some tacos!!!!",

I crushed them both. I also got an horchata. I'm very picky about both but omg I loved it. The tacos were perfectly moist and dry with amazing flavors and the horchata was literally perfect. I'm extra picky about my horchata but to be completely honest it might be one of my favorites ever. I definitely will be going back and telling my friends about it. Friendly staff, ample seating, delicious food. Nothing more you can ask for really! :)",

The person who tooked my order was friendly and very attractive. Unlike some places they are not and don't even care how they look. Food came out quick and presentation was decent. Although it was fast it didn't taste like those fast food places. I had the Burrito combo which had a choice of meat. I chose the Al Pastor and chose the sides of rice and beans. Everything was good and tasty. Definitely would come again and try the other menu items like their Menudo or their Lengua.",

I came in with Angela on a Sunday afternoon and the place was empty.  We ordered 4 different types of tacos.  They were all just ok.  Not amazing nor terrible.  But they are pricey.  $2.50 a taco is really pushing it.  That's what you'd pay for a gourmet taco.  What's a gourmet taco?  I don't know but if I was ordering a gourmet taco it'd be $2.50.  So I wasn't too please with the price and honestly, this alone is enough reason for me not to come back though I'd have to try something else on the menu.",

    "text": "Deju vu, Flash backs, and memories of a blurred period came out of the wood works when I walked into this place.   It was Sunday morning around 10:30, and there were three cleaned out bowls of Menudo on an empty table.  This is when I  looked back at the front door to see if I warp back to the past decade, and was about to get mobbed by a group of kids trying to sell me Chicklets.    No Twilight zone episode came about on this visit, but this Taco experience was pretty close of bringing back some memories at back street hole in the wall in Esenada.  Thanks to groupon, I bought a 5.00 for 10.00 special from them, and ordered a Taco and Gordita combo, and a couple of tacos from the front counter.    The counter girl was very friendly, and took my coupon with a smile, and told me that everything will be out very shortly.   As I sat down at the table, again I got another flashback when I looked outside...damn, this part of Sahara looks like Ensenada.    I had some pretty incredible party times in that part of Mexico, and started to remembering about those Tequila girls slammers, which was next door to a place that looked like this restaurant.     My meal came within 7 minutes, and most of it was Carne Asada gordita, and one Barbacoa taco.     The went after the Gordita first, and this was my favorite of the entire meal.   They do grill it over a gas open flame, and it had good flavor, and more than ample of amount of meat.    The Barbacoa was very moist, and they almost can pull this off without any salsa with their version of this meat.    The rice, and beans were pretty generic, but isn't most places in Las Vegas at this price point.  Why a four start?   They forgot to give me my chip and salsa, and didn't tell me where's the salsa bar was located.   I walked up the counter, and was about to asks for salsa, but I noticed the three ketchup size squirt bottles in front..   They do serve most of the top Mexican beers, but this was the last thing I wanted to drink in a place like this.( For personal reasons..lol)  The food is great, but I didn't want Rod Sterling coming out, and telling me...you just drank a case of Tecate and giant bottle of Tequila , and you just entered the twilight light zone.      I'll come back to eat, but no drinkey, drinkey for me.",

I ordered the Burrito combo and it was made fresh and came with small serving of beans and rice and a tasty pepper, and a medium drink.   It was served in a styrofoam container and plastic fork.  I am not a big fan of either and the plastic fork was hard to \"cut\"  through the burrito and the fork was too small for my personal preference.  The medium sauce i was given, added little flavor to my food and I probably should have used the hotter sauce.  The waitress was friendly and I have no problem with service.  I try to be fair about my reviews and would say the food I ordered was OK, but nothing to write home about.",

I ordered another taco cause I thought two wouldn't fill me up.   I got two asada tacos, and one lengua tacos. Man oh man, the tortillas are defo homemade and handmade with love. I took a bite out of my asada taco and surprise in the bottom, refried beans! I wasn't expecting that!  The chips and salsa...well the salsa was also unexpecting full of sweet and spicy. The tomatoes were cut not into diced and square norms but smashed. I actually enjoyed it. It had a taste of sweetness from the tomatoes and actually spiciness of it being a salsa.  I definitely recommend Abuelita's when you in the east side of Vegas looking for some good Mexican food.",

Customer service was good the lady at the counter was patient while I decided what to order. The salsa was far from spicy just adds a little bit of flavor.",

I've definitely have had better in San Diego and LA. The fries were perhaps the best part of the meal because the entree was loaded with sticky cheeses that harden easily and  meat tasted a little too burn and a little bit of refried beans (no even 1 tablespoons of it) at the bottom of the plate. The presentation really needs some work... the side of these Styrofoam plate was dirty with food, not sure if it was ours.  Overall I would not go back but its an ok place to eat at.",

    "text": "So the homemade tortilla's are really good, but everything else is just sort of decent. But that's not a bad thing. The menu is pretty basic, so don't expect your standard array of Mexican combo plates, because they don't have them. You basically pick your poison--taco, burrito or a bowl, with a meat choice and if you combo it for $6-8 you get rice, beans and a drink. That's it.   My mom really wanted a good tortilla with beans, so I went searching for a place with just that. She had the tacos with the chicarrones verde and lengua. She loved them both. I'm not a meat-eater, so I had their breakfast burrito, which is usually made with eggs, chorizo, rice and beans, but they were very accomodating and made the burrito to my exact specifications. I only which I would've gotten my burrito fillings in a bowl and just ordered a side of tortillas.   The food is simple and basic, but still very fresh (one HUGE exception being the chips, but you didn't come for that anyways, right?), affordable and not in the least bit greasy. Oh and the service was awesome! The lady working the register was very nice, very attentive, and personable. It really was just like eating at a friend's place you've known for years.   Do yourself a favor. Don't come here with super high expectations, because this place isn't trying to revolutionize the taco. It's not their schtick. But do still try them if you're in the area, because the tortillas were pretty damn good. Word to the wise, the red salsa/sauce that they have in a squeeze bottle wasn't that great. If you must drizzle a condiment on your food, the green sauce was much better.",

I think there were 16 of us all together and we basically put some tables together and made one giant table to accommodate us which was also nice.  I ordered the two asada tacos with rice, beans, and fountain drink combo.  It was good but nothing really stood out except for the tortillas. There were nice chunks of steak but not a lot of flavor. The refried beans and rice were also very basic.  They did 4 or 5 different hot sauces.  I like there pineapple and fruit drinks that were next to the fountain drinks selection. Which I drank a lot of because I was very thirsty and they were delicious.  You might notice a few deals for this place. 1 free charro with a purchase of a combo when checking in with Yelp app, which I passed on at the end, filled with drink. $5 for $10 Groupon which I also passed on.  They have weekends specials for menudo and 2 other items, I am a fan of menudo.  When making your tacos, burritos, etc you have a choice of asada, chicken, shrimp, tongue, barbacoa, chicharones, and maybe 1 or 2 more meats.",

Carne asada Gordita and fish taco to be exact, meat had okay flavor but was kinda tough the fish taco was abysmal. I would've taken Del tacos fish tacos over it any day. Husband had the carne asada burrito, let's just say my sons McDonalds quarter pounder was preferred over finishing the said burrito. A big deal as he lives for Mexican food. The highlight of that meal was the chips and salsa.   Another disappointment was the flavorless horchata and them running out of flan which as the lady said is made by the Abuela herself but have been out for 2 weeks now. Unfortunately that does not help my situation here. 2 stars for the food and 1 star for the personable lady. The quest for tacos continue...",

    "text": "Well, the hype is like... a no from me dawg. This place was not worth it, honestly. The pricing is high for the quality and quantity of food offered. I ordered a few different items, and all were wrong, yet I got charged for what I ordered. It took a long time, so I wasn't about to ask for a remake. Plus the cashier and cook were busy on their phones.   When people say this food is authentic, they must have never eaten at a real Mexican restaurant. Also, their tacos are not the biz, the carne asada was dry and the upcharge for the hot cheetos tortilla is NOT worth it, you can't even taste it, might as well put red food coloring in the masa and call it a day.  The one thing that was not the business was how dirty it was inside, a lot of the tables were dirty! I had to get a napkin and wipe the shit down before we ate, no big deal, right? FUCKING WRONG. I spent over $30 and the food was shit, and I have to clean my own table? NAH.",

I've had to let them know my meat is a little old and dry, for the cashier to tell me \"you let it get cold.\"The place has gained notoriety because the food was actually amazing but lately the customer service is poor and the food isn't fresh. *******The owner (Leslie) contacted me in regards to the review, apologized and have no further action has been taken besides saying \"sorry, you should never be treated this way\".********",

    "text": "Came to check out the HOT CHEETOS taco hype. I am a Hot Cheetos super fan. I used to eat them every day for \"lunch\" during my high school days and miraculously, I am still alive. As an adult, I don't eat them as often due to the heartburn, stomach ache, etc. When I came across a photo of this amazing creation taken by Daniel Dong-Kyu K, I knew I had to go ASAP. I wondered if I would hurt after eating this or would I be In Hot Cheetos heaven. The hand made tortillas made by the abuelas working in the kitchen have added Hot Cheetos crumbs worked into the masa to produce the red tortilla/Hot Cheetos coloring. The taco is topped with Hot Cheetos chips that add the beautiful final touch. Let me say that I ordered a regular carne asada taco and a Hot Cheetos taco and of course I immediately regretted not getting two Hot Cheetos tacos. The carne asada was on point. The regular taco was very good and would give it 4/5. But duh, the Hot Cheetos taco took the win and was the highlight of my day. Overall, the taco was not as spicy as I anticipated. It has been 6 hours since I ate the Hot Cheetos taco and I have no heartburn or bad stomach ache...a major plus! Now I can get my taco and Hot Cheetos fix all rolled in one! I am already planning my next trip back to this taco shop. I wish they had one on my side of town, but for now, I am willing to drive over here to get my fix. Ugh, as I type this, I wish I was eating those tacos. The reason for the 4 star review is because we ordered a side of nachos and they were not good. We ate a couple of bites and threw away the rest. They were too soggy. Chips that are overdressed in sour cream and beans and become soggy AF are gross. We did not enjoy this dish at all. Hot Cheetos tacos.....I will dream of you until we meet again.",

I was expecting great quality, freshness, and flavor due to the reviews. But they must be fake or have a lot of family that post reviews for them. The meat was so old dry, cheap, greasy, and i don't know what served me but it was not all pastor it wasn't even in its special marinade.   Honestly robertos is better. I drove 30mim just to try this place will never go here again and do not recommend. I get it was just the hot cheeto hype that made them popular, which was also dissapointing. They must pay for advertisement.",

The tables don't seem to look like they get wiped, the napkin holder was super dirty with dust along with the salt & pepper containers. A family got up before we got our food and the table didn't get cleaned the whole time we were there.   We were drawn to this place for their hot cheetos tortillas, I ordered the gordita & taco combo plate. The food wasn't even warm when we got our plates. The flavors were off, it wasn't properly seasoned. The tortillas themselves did not look or taste fresh when they advertise they make them fresh. I ordered carne asada and the pieces were in chunks which made everything fall out and a lot of the pieces had more fat than meat. The horchata was so watered down it tasted like sugared water with a faint hint of cinnamon.   The food did not meet the expectations of the price we paid for. Not going back and I don't recommend this place at all.",

    "text": "Wow, the pricing here is amazing.   For a two taco combo, it is $7 + $0.50 more for a hot Cheeto tortilla. Comes with a choice or rice + beans or chips + salsa. One taco without the combo is $2.50.   Meat choices:  -Asada  -Chicken  -Lengua  -Barbacoa  -Fish -Shrimp  -Chicharron Verde  -Al Pastor  I ordered one hot cheeto asada taco along with an order of beef flautas (choice of beef or chicken).   Meat in both was tender, juicy, & flavorful. I expected the hot Cheeto tortilla to be better; however, it was good enough. I wish they were able to make it a bit crispier because it's super soft but it would probably come out like a tostada.   The flautas were so good!! Not too crispy, just perfect. Comes with sour cream & pico. $0.75 more for guac.   Would do the flautas again and try other options -- hot cheeto taco was good to try once.   Service 5/5! Restrooms & interior also clean.",

I don't really feel that the cheetos added anything, not even any spice. The carne aside needs a bit more flavor. It was also a little bit on the chewier side.  We also tried the chicken...This is the best choice here, by far. The flavor is smoky and would compliment a spicy salsa well.   My husband did not feel well after eating here. I had the same items, and I felt fine, so I can't contribute it to them.   I can't say we will be back, but maybe, we just came on an imperfect day.",

You know that feeling when you taste something for the 1st time and it's so good that your eyes open wide and you just smile with how good it tastes? Well this is the feeing that my husband and I had forkful after forkful! The fries were perfectly cooked, non greasy and crispy. It's a huge portion that is definitely shareable (if you want) the meat is juicy and tender and the right amount of hot Cheetos are put into the mix. This place definitely is doing something right.   I can't ever get on a diet, knowing that this place exists! Abuela's Tacos, keep taking my money as I am one happy customer!!!  The Klasey's + Abuela's Tacos = Love Forever",

Again the food for the most part was solid just not amazing.  The hot cheeto tacos were a disappointment.  You couldn't taste any hot cheeto at all.   No cleanliness or service issues like I have seen in other reviews.  The restaurant was clean when we went and the young kid who rung us up was super cute and helpful.",

Seriously, you would think this would be super easy to find. There are nine million taco shops in Vegas. Probably close to the same amount as San Diego, but the food just has never been up to par.   Step in Abuela's.   So I have to admit. I have a weird thing I do at taco shops. I totally understand if you judge me after reading this. I ask to sample the beans. I know, it's silly, but my favorite thing in the entire world is a bean & cheese burrito (I'm a simpleton). So if I'm going to commit to a 1/2lb pile of beans I want to make sure they're the goods. More times than not they're okay, just not great. I knew my world was going to be rocked when I asked to sample the beans and the girl up front got super excited and said I would love them. I did. The burrito was absolutely amazing.   The only thing I'm sad about is that there aren't more Abuela's locations in the valley. This spot is pretty far from me, but worth the drive.  Also, the chips & salsa were killer. Salsa was fresh and flavorful, not a ton of heat, just the way I like it.   I'll be back, many, many times!",

    "text": "It is currently Fiesta in my hometown of San Antonio, Texas and though I am not there, I am empathetically craving gorditas, which are readily available from street vendors and at festivals. Unfortunately in Vegas they're far harder to come across. Luckily I was working on the east side and Ranae W reminded me of this spot.  Abuela's is clean with a simple menu of tacos, burritos, gorditas, and combos. They also appear to have recently added enchiladas, another favorite of mine. Order at the counter, help yourself to the salsa bar, and wait. My takeout was ready quick and the ladies who helped me were friendly.   I tore into my order- 2 gorditas, one asada on corn and the other barbacoa (another hard thing to find in Vegas) on flour, $3.75/ea. If you're familiar with arepas, they're a similar pocket filled with beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and your choice of protein. The corn holds up a bit better and the asada is more flavorful but both were large and filling, but I'd come back to try the lengua or shrimp.",

This was the first horchata anywhere that I really didn't care for. Their was a lot of meat in the taco and the flavor wasn't bad. The enchiladas were cold and the cheese was far from melted. The beans and rice were a pass as in hard pass, no go. Take the chips and salsa instead. The sauces are not thickened with flour which makes a nice option for the gluten free folks. No offense to their abuela but my abuela would beat them hands down, as would several other abuelas I know.  Update:  I did receive a response from the restaurant owner which is always a welcome surprise. I'm hopeful that next time I'll get burned by some hot cheesy enchiladas! I also upped the star rating based on the attentiveness. Love to see that! Thanks!",

I have tried the chicken and carne asada tacos and both were able to satisfy my hunger at the moment. The chicken tacos were okay.. it could have had more of that grilled taste, but nonetheless, I would eat it again. The carne asada tacos were my favorite! It was filled with a lot of meat and toppings on top! At the restaurant, they have a few sauces in bottles. Its fun to just try a whole bunch of sauces, but be careful if you do not like a lot of spice! The bottles are just red and green and you do not know what the spice levels are!  My favorite dish from this place that I crave all the time like a pregnant woman (i'm not expecting, however.. I just love this dish that much...) is the CEVICHE!!!! Their shrimp is made perfectly and it is so juicy with the sauces they put on top! It is dry-- not your typical wet ceviche but for sure.. THIS IS A MUST TRY dish! It is so addicting. It does not come with a lot of chips so make sure you ask for extra on the side.  Overall, this place is one of my favorites. It is a bit pricey, but I think it is definitely worth it!",

I've Taco'd well over 500 times, in various taquerias, roach coaches, and street corners, and any time fresh tortillas are made, it is always a good plus when looking for a tasty taco.  We shared a taco combo which came with two tacos with rice, beans OR chips and salsa, but a few of us didn't see the OR part and we asked for chips and salsa as well...Oooops! The chips were stale and we just pushed them to the side. Wifey got an Asada Taco, and I got a Lengua Taco which was very soft and tasty, and the sides weren't bad either.  Don't forget to use your Yelp Check-In offer for a free Churro which is filled with a dulce de leche cream...ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(270/365) \" Gracias Abuelita!\"",

    "text": "OK, the parentals came up from Southern Cal for a visit on the way up to Salt Lake. They wanted something quick to eat but not fast food (you know, the Taco Bell / Burger King crap). I recommended Abuelas since its down the street from the house. They said OK.   (Now just a primer here -- My dad is a semi-quasi professional chef (has pro training but just uses it at the house) and a very finicky palate - junk food just doesn't cut it. My mom likes the finer things in life but will eat Taco Bell and such if forced)  So we arrive on Taco Tuesday around 3p, a few people inside. Pops was kind of thrown off by the walk up and order from the counter (as he is a menu and full catering type), but the lady by the counter was extremely friendly and had Dad communicating. Mom was in awe that the gal in the back was actually hand pressing home made tortillas. The order was 2 carne asada burrito plates (me & pops) and mom gets 2 carne asada tacos, chips/salsa & side of guac.  Mom's easy, plows into the tacos. Loves it. Loves the pico salsa that comes with the chips, liked the green hot sauce but didn't care for the red thicker hot sauce. Guac was good, real avocados but not much else, no problem. Roasted pepper devoured.   Dad kinda picks at the plate at first and I think, ut oh. Then he says the beans and meat are very good and well seasoned. Hurray I didn't disappoint the pops. Ate everything but the grilled green onion (I stole that). Didn't care for the rice and chips much, but as he says, those are fillers and he thought the chip salsa was good but a tad too much salt. Overall - he was impressed and said he would return if/when they come back out. After 2 hours ago of Abuela's dining and chatting about stuff & life, it turned out to be a real pleasant afternoon. Thanks Abuela's.",

While waiting for our tacos, we enjoyed the complimentary salsa (spicy) and chips.  The shrimp tacos were by far the best though the others were very good with each being served on a homemade tortilla.  Prices are bit higher than the comparison.",

However, if you do feel brave enough to go here, they have some of the tastiest carne asada I've had, but I am by no means an expert.  I also tasted the al pastor, and I was not a fan of the immense saltiness.  I would go back to try the shrimp and fish.

    "text": "I can see why Abuela's has been voted best tacos in town before. It's a step above your usual Mexican fast food and well worth going to if your a taco lover. I also don't know anywhere else in town that makes their own tortillas to order for tacos.  Abuela's has a fairly typical menu for a fast/casual Mexican place. They have taco's, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, etc... The one notable thing they have that most other places don't is gorditas. If your only experience with gorditas is taco bell, then your in for a very different experience trying one here. The gordita is pretty much a taco with a much thicker tortilla, and they aren't for me but many people love them.  They have all the usual meats that most Mexican places have. My two favorites are the carne asada and barbacoa, which are both well seasoned and juicy. One meat they have that isn't that standard is the green chili chicarones (fried pork skin), again, not my thing but very popular.  I've had a few different things here, but the tacos are what stand out. This isn't one of those places that serve small street tacos. The tacos here are fairly large and a two taco combo meal should be more than enough to fill you up. As mentioned above, they make all their tortillas in house and to order, and that really is what makes their tacos stand out amongst their competition.  Their prices are also very reasonable and you can't beat the $7 dollar price tag on the two taco combo meal. You get two tacos, a drink, and choice of beans and rice or chips and salsa (I would go with the beans and rice). if you want to try a gordita you can get a taco and gordita meal for only $1 dollar more.  All and all, Abuela's is above average for Mexican food, but has truly fantastic tacos. If your a taco lover, you really should try to come here some time for some of the best tacos in Las Vegas.",

We placed our order then I realized they had Sangria and when I wanted to order it the girl seemed bothered to have me place a second order, just told me to wait in a dismissive manor. You shouldn't make your customers feel like they are bothering you. Anyhow, most important part of it all, THE FOOD. We got our food to go, by the time we got home (were like 5 or less minutes away) the Cheetos were a bit soggy. No crunch to them, you could barely taste them. We also got a quesadilla for our niece, which was a regular plain quesadilla, nothing special. In all honesty I've had way better carne asada fries, this left me disappointed and did not hit the spot. Their churros were good though, one out of three.",

I chose the rice and beans The taco with barbacoa was really tasty! Nice and moist! The carne aside was just ok, and same for the rice and beans.   I felt the price was a little hefty for a whole-in-the-wall-esque type of place.  I mayyyyyyyyyyyyy stop by here and try something different but I'm pretty on the fence about it.",

Since it was my first time eating here, I ordered an Asada taco, a fish taco, one chicken, one barbacoa and one chicharron verde taco. First, the ones I liked. The beef asada taco was amazing. The chicken was good. My favorite was the chicharron verde (although it's spicy so not everyone may like it, but I LOVE spicy. Bring it on!)   The woman who took my order said they're known for the barbacoa. I wasn't impressed with it. It was bland, like it needed salt and pepper. The fish was also disappointing: pre-cooked and oily with really thick batter and very little fish.  Despite the two so-so tacos, I'll definitely be back. I was particularly impressed by watching them make the tortillas for the tacos right in front of me.",

I don't like thick tortillas, especially on my quesadillas, and it made it thick and stiff. The meat was also pretty grizzly although it had good flavor. I tried a new type of pork taco. I don't remember the name but it was saucy. It was OK. I'm actually surprised this got the Best of Vegas award. I've had much better Mexican food in Vegas although there aren't many.",

I had the taco and gordita combo which comes with a drink and a choice of chips/salsa or rice/beans. You get to select what meat you want and looks like there is no additional charge for shrimp. I picked the carne asada. I added the chips and salsa and flan. All of the food was delicious and reminded me of homemade meals of my grandmother : )  I especially loved the gordita. Instead of a deep fried thick corn tortilla it was made out of thick flour tortilla. A way healthier option without sacrificing taste. The beans were flavorful and the rice moist. No skimping on the meat, it was lean and it was some of the most tasty, I have ever had. They also included a grilled green onion and grilled jalapeno. Although, I live in the Centennial Hills area, I will be going back here regularly and recommend you try it for yourself.",

Its a little cute place and gives off the home feel when you walk in. They have a basic menu, Tacos, Burritos, Quesadillas, Carne Asada Fries, Nachos and etc. Very clean and they even make the tortillas fresh. The staff is very friendly. Had the Chicken Burrito with rice, beans, cheese and pico de gallo. So damn good. I had to stop myself from inhaling it. I wanted to enjoy it. My wife had the Carne Asada Nachos. Them and the Carne Asada Fries are among the best in town. Just every layer has so much meat, cheese, beans, and im guessing they use Mexican Crema instead of regular sour cream. So dang addicting. We been there a couple times and we keep going back to what he had even though we keep saying we gonna try something different lol. If your tired of Roberto's i say give this place a try. Nice to have a place that has food that tastes like mom or in this case, Grandma makes :-) Until next time, Let's Eat!!!",

We ordered two plates of the huevos rancheros, which were far from traditional, and paid $25!!!  I was not very happy, epecially since it was just two cooked eggs (not the way I ordered them) on top of two tortillas (not hand made) and an abundance of chopped up tomatoe and onion on top! WHAT!? Are you kidding me?! and for $8.95 a plate... I was better off cooking breakfast at home! On top of that for some odd reason we were charged for 6 xtra sides of tortillas!!! WHY!!!??? On top of -THAT- there was no cheese or sour cream added to the huevos rancheros, which is a pretty traditional part of the meal.. I wouldn't dare to ask for them to add that, because then we probabably would have surpassed $30 for a BREAKFAST for two people. We won't be going back that's for sure.. you can find better quality for that price.  This was a to go order, I did call and complain and they agreed to refund my money charged for this \"extra side\" of tortillas.. It won't make me or break me, but I would rather put that money in my jar which is used to buy toys for the less fortunate children during the holiday season, than to give it to a ridiculously over priced business.  They also downgraded me when my co-worker went to pick up the money..  I guess they didn't appreciate me for complaining.. Well did not appreciate them for over charging me for less than a satisying meal!!!",

We are from San Diego and we have pretty good Mexican food in SD, but Abuela's totally topped anything we have ever had! The hand made tortillas were so fresh and had amazing flavor. We had the carne asada, fish and shrimp tacos. The fish was good, but that is the only one I would say San Diego has anyone beat on. The meals were not overly salty, all the ingredients went together so well, we are very impressed. A day later we were craving Abuela's tacos again, but this time I had one of each flavor to go. oh my talk about deeeelicious, and The barbacoa was AMAZING! We ended up going back one more time for our drive back, for total of three visits in our six day stay. We are definitely going to have Abuela's on our list when we come back. Mary was so nice and made us feel at home. All three times I did not find the restaurant to be in a dangerous area, maybe just a little bit of an older neighborhood, especially if you compare it to the strip.",
