We arrived on time were seated 30 mins later and we had the most inexperienced waiter poor sap obviously had no clue how to serve or even sell the menu.  30 minutes later he still hadn't taken our drink order or our appetizer order.  Finally we had to call the manger, he compted our appetizers and the waiter still screwed up the drink order there were 6 of us but he only took 5 drink orders and again we had to wait to drink. At $100 a head service should be top notch but not in this place.  Sorry but not worth it.",

    "text": "We were a wedding party of 15 who went directly to the restaurant after the ceremony had concluded in a suite at the Redrock Hotel.  They were not ready for us on time for our reservation, and shuffled us onto the outdoor patio.  It was warm out there and no drink servers were on duty.  This was not a good way to continue a wedding celebration.  But it kept getting worse!  After about 45 minutes, the groom contacted his host for the hotel.  The host found out that another large party had held up the restaurant by staying at their table for four hours.  This was a very unprofessional excuse as they knew we had a reservation and should have set up something ahead of time.  We waited another 15-20 minutes for them to do so.  When finally seated, the wedding party was then told the restaurant was out of several menu items that were the reason the restaurant was chosen in the first place!  Talk about killing a special celebration!  And to add insult to injury, they offered nothing to make up the damage!  They in the least should have offered free cocktails!  Now, they want to call each member of the wedding party to apologize!  How embarrassing is that gesture?  The bad PR alone should have at least been worth a few free dinners.  Insulting, unprofessional and ridiculous.  And...the suite was dirty!  Redrock is rocky.  Never again....",

    "text": "Made reservations for 5 people at 7:30pm with a confirmed e-mail. It was a special occasion as my daughter was graduating from college and she wanted to experience a great steakhouse and chose T-Bones. We arrived at 7:25 and were told that the reservation was cancelled. They had no reason. (Strike 1) They managed to get us a table after 20 minutes and we were seated. We ordered a bottle of wine so we could toast our daughter's accomplishment. They asked for her ID and she had not brought her purse so she could not drink any wine.(I understood because of the strict laws of underage drinking) I sent the unopened bottle back as we did not want to drink and toast to our daughter if she could not drink a glass of wine. The sommelier was annoyed and took it back (Strike 2). We all wanted to try the prime rib and the waiter said in a sarcastic voice, \"The Prime Rib is not available to you.... We're out. (Strike 3 .... we're out) I told everyone to get up and we were leaving. They did not apologize for being rude or running out of Prime Rib. What kind of a steakhouse runs out of a main dish at 7:45 in the evening? We went down the road to Fleming's Steakhouse on West Charleston and had a fantastic meal, with great service!! In the words of my wise father-in-law...  T-Bones is a clip joint. Don't go there!!",

By far the best seafood platter that I've ever experienced... cool lighting on the tiered vessel by the way!   My only disappointment was that the server or menu didn't tell me that the 90 day dry aged steak was going to be prepared mesquite style... (which I can not stand the flavor of a band aid)  so next time I vow to ask first how my steak is prepared... pan fried preferably...)_   o m g  Francisco was our front server and he went out of his way to take care of us... he was the epitome of fine dining service... we wanted for nothing in his care... I spoke with the manager, Stephanie throughout dinner and she too was very accommodating, she alone has me saying \" I am now a regular at this phenomenal restaurant!\"' Melanie (the bar tender asked me to remove my hat... lol  but I soon found out she wanted it for herself )_   It's a great hat by the way...  Anyway we ended with the carrot cake... which literally is a slab of cake... incredible!    Yum Yum  I truly can't wait to become a regular at this restaurant... they even have outside dining.. so those who smoke can sneak away for a quick toke.   weeeeeeeee    Adam  needs to be a little less aloof and listen to his guests... just sayin'///  other than that A ++ loved our experience",

    "text": "Disappointing.  If you are looking for a steakhouse in Summerlin, just go to Flemings.  First, we made a reservation on Open Table.  They claimed to not have it, but when I looked on my Blackberry the reservation was there and we got the points.  I don't know if they were trying to get around the fact that they couldn't seat us right away or someone screwed up.  I could overlook that, but it got worse.  We ordered the bone-in rib-eye, petite filet mignon, lobster tail, tomatoes with spinach & cheese, truffle tater tots and a bottle of wine.  The wine was good.  But they didn't make the wine.    The food took forever to come out.  I can be understanding about that.  The kitchen is in the weeds.  But the servers (we had two) should at least come by and say something reassuring.  Instead they avoided us like the plague until the food came out.   The tomatoes were awful.  Don't get them.  They claim it is specialty and that is just sad.  The waiter immediately informed us that the tomatoes come with American cheese and asked if we wanted another kind of cheese. American cheese is just weird (Kraft singles?), especially on $10 tomatoes, and I'm assuming they got a lot of complaints.  We ordered them with jack cheese but it was still awful.  The spinach is obviously frozen.  Ugh.  The tater tots were ok.  Not a lot of truffle flavor.  But it takes mad skills to screw up a tater tot.  The lobster tail was really tough and nasty.  Plus, they gave us the drawn butter way to early and all they have to keep it warm is a sad little tea candle.  The bone-in rib eye was ordered medium rare but came out well done.  And the table next to us ordered their steaks well-done (yeah... whatever) and they got medium rare.  Needless to say, food was sent back.  On the positive side, the petite filet mignon was perfect.  Yummy, yummy.  But not enough to save the meal.  I really wanted good lobster.  Oh well.    Plus, the clientele that comes to this restaurant is not normal.  Ignoring the couple that ordered their steaks well done, we sat next to 2 girls who wanted to tell EVERYONE that it was their anniversary.  Then they would wait for a reaction (no reaction from anyone) and they would explain that they are not lesbians and it is their \"friendship anniversary\".  As if there is even such a thing. Also, these people brought their kid who promptly passed out in the chair in a very awkward position.  I admire the girl's ability to sleep anywhere, but come on, if your kid is about to pass out, don't go to a steakhouse! At least we saw Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi! They're great!",

On top of my work! ;)  And I must admit that we dined here twice ... Clearly, we enjoyed!  A girlfriend and I sat at the bar on this night at TBones.  It was Monday night football, packed restaurant and bar.  We finally scored 2 seats together, right in front of 1 set of TVs and prime location.  The bartender was very nice and attentive.  She was soon to be shocked at how much food my friend and I ordered.  Hey, we wanted to get a taste of so many things ... We did.  On our menu:  Cauliflower Mushrooms - sounds random. looks like little ribbons. tastes delicious!  Macaroni and Cheese - to die for. large noodles. 4-5 cheeses. sinful.  Lump Meat Crab Cocktail (this was on 2nd night) - fresh. generous portion. yummy.  Petite Filet Mignon - more than enough for this girl - especially in accompaniment with all the sides. plus i added real horseradish. spicy. tender. tasty.  the sad thing ... we never got to taste the desert - we were so full come desert time we just couldn't do it to ourselves - our thighs - our bellies ... : (    Only 2 downers of TBones:  1- The hostesses were annoying. snobby. not helpful. not educated on their surroundings. they need a lesson in how to treat the customer.  2- Be prepared to spend the evening here.  The service isn't the quickest, but you will enjoy the process.",

    "text": "I really hate to give such a low score but it was truly THAT bad. We stayed at the Red Rock for a little get away for my Birthday. For our first night we decided to treat ourselves to a nice steak dinner at TBones. Bad idea- we received $200 worth of salt and terrible service. We had a drink in the bar first then requested a table. We were less than thrilled when they sat us in the bar but we're pretty easy to please so we went with it. The server took her time to greet us and rushed us through our order as if we were inconveniencing her. We ordered the Steak House Salad, Broccoli, Mushrooms, garlic mashed potatoes and 2 small cut filet mignons. The salad came out with the wrong dressing. The waitress took it back and it was back out pretty quick. It was really great once it was corrected and sadly was the best part or our meal. The waitress asked if we would like bread, however, this did not come out until right as our meal was arriving. The steaks and sides came out but we were given augratin potatoes instead of broccoli. The food runner quickly corrected this however, our waitress was nowhere to be found. The first bite of the filet was fantastic but as we each got to our second and third we could barely get through the rest of the steak. It was so salty! Even the garlic mash and the mushrooms were unbearably salty. The manager asked how everything was as he was walking by and no joke did not stop as he asked. I began to speak and let him know but he interrupted and said \"great!\" and kept walking. Our waitress finally came by and at this point we just wanted to get out of there! We gave her our card and she came back with the check but not after she seemed completely inconvenienced by us asking her to box our left overs. As if it could worse, she charged us for the broccoli AND the augratin potatoes! I had to waive her down from another table and she ran off to fix it but apparently was unable to reverse the charge so after 5 minutes of waiting at the table she gave us $10 in cash. I understand this is nit picky but what about the tax that we paid? Sure its only a dollar but when we dropped over $200 for a terrible dinner and even worse service that dollar counts! We are extremely happy to drop money on a steak dinner,in fact we went to SW Steakhouse a few nights later and it was spectacular, but this was just a joke. Spending that much money- I expect good service we shouldn't feel like we are stressing our waitress out and not feel completely miserable due to our meal being so salty. All around a bad experience.",

    "text": "I'm basing this purely on the food and not the experience.  The ambiance is wonderful: four stars unquestionably.  The same applies for the entire hotel.  The designers did a great job making this a classy, yet unpretentious atmosphere.    The service at this restaurant was very good. Diane did a great job as did the busboy (?); both were very knowledgeable on the items and we didn't feel rushed.  The bread was also very good and we'll stop there.  The tomato soup was very acidic, and could have used some more cream, salt or perhaps should just scrap that recipe altogether.  The cauliflower mushrooms in brown butter were greasy/oily, and very unappetizing.  Diane was gracious enough to scratch those items off the bill and brought my wife a bowl of french onion which tasted much better albeit nothing extraordinary.  My wife ordered the filet mignon and I ordered the T-bone.  Both cuts were cooked as ordered, although both were dry and unmemorable. The sauces were probably intended to add flavor to a flavorless meat and we didn't care for any of them. For nearly 50 dollars a piece, we expected something divine, but I've picked up better stuff at my local Safeway.  If I had paid 25 dollars, our leftovers would have gone in the trash, but I managed to get a couple of burritos out of them.    For as much as this restaurant charges (our bill came to over 200 dollars), I would give this 1 star, but the service was excellent and the atmosphere was very nice.  It's a good thing the wine wasn't corked.  For those that don't eat out a lot, it's worth going, but if you're a food connoisseur,  save your money.",

    "text": "A major disappointment.  We've recently moved into Las Vegas and had dinner at this hotel's coffee shop a few weeks ago and was very impressed.  So, being a steak lover, I wanted to check this restaurant out.  We didn't realize it was so upscale (the casino is very casual) and were out shopping nearby, so it was a last minute idea to eat there.  We walked in just after 5pm on Sat, only a couple of table were occupied, so not having a reservation didn't seem to be an issue and we were seated right away.  The waiter explained the menu well and took our orders.  While waiting for our appetizers and bread to be served, the hostess seated a party of four right next to us (in what was basically an empty restaurant) -- the people had a small DOG with them.  I immediately looked at the hostess and said this would be a problem for me, and one of the 4 people quickly said \"it's a service dog\" (looked like a household pet to me).  I got up and said to my girlfriend, their table and the hostess \"We'll go to another restaurant\" -- no attempt was made to have us stay.  I've been eating in these types of restaurants for decades and never had dinner sitting next to a dog before anywhere (even at fast food places), it's too bad because I was hoping for a great, memorable meal -- of course at $80 a person, it should be great.",

Came early and waited at the bar for a bit. Bar wasn't as busy as usual. Was steady but not like the usual craziness there. One of the drone hostesses sat us ... at a table in the bar area and not in our servers section. It was loud and well, it just sucked. We told hostess we would really rather wait for a normal table in a quiet section with the server we requested. We were told 30 minutes, grabbed some drinks and sat outside. Jennifer that works outside was really congenial and smiled and was courteous unlike the rest of the hostesses. Waited... waited. 30 minutes went by, then an hour. Spoke to hostesses who were totally unaccommodating said we still had to wait. Watched a walk-in couple come in and then promptly be seated in the section we requested. Wtf? Went back the hostess who gave us a blank look and got manager. Think that's when they realized they forgot about us and gave someone else our seats. So needless to say hour and half later no table, no food. Only crappy over priced drinks from a bartender who clearly didn't want to serve us. Vince the manager offered, after we'd already paid of course, to take care of our drinks. Also offered us a to go order =\\ So I guess they at least tried...No thanks. While in the middle of our conversation another couple came in and interrupted him... he left us mid conversation standing there and chatted with them. What the hell? We just left and no one stopped us. Really surprised! We used to eat here pretty often. Over all a totally awful evening... at t-bones anyhow. Went over to Vinter Grill and had a nice dinner there instead.  Love server Denise here and food is great. Rest of staff is unaccommodating and just plain rude. A shame because we really like this place. For price you pay its just disgustingly unnecessary. We are working parents so we don't get to go out often so its pretty disappointing to receive this kind of service.  Time for a new restaurant. ***Ok part three of our T bones journey (a month later). My husband was jonesing for t bones and I begrudgingly let him give it another shot. He called, made reservations and explained our last catastrophe. Dinner was good. We again didn't get the server we requested but just gave up at that point. Had a nice dinner and when the bill came the manager comped it. So at least they seem to want to keep their regulars. I really appreciated that and we may be back.",

I had the petite filet mignon my friend had the T-bone we had some appetizers wine the whole nine yard cause it was my friends birthday.  I mad sure to make a reservation for 8pm we got there at 7:50pm checked in and we were told we will be seated shortly. That was a lie because we didn't until 845pm. The host with a long blond hair was by far the rudest and unpleasant face to have in the front. She couldn't even talk to my friend properly. Whatever your name is please watch some You tube videos on customer service; this will only get you to a better future. I ran into the chef on my way to the restroom asked me if we were seated as he was the one that was trying to get us seated in the first place. I told him if the reservation was really needed since they didn't sit us on time. I told him it is a special occasion he told me they will have us pick a dessert for him so they can bring it after our dinner. So he ended up telling our server and the rest of the crew there. After our dinner our server came he asked what kind of dessert we would like I told him surprise us with the best one he recommends so he went on to get the desert and never came back to our table. Since we both have to go to work in the morning we had to ask another person to bring us our check. My friend was generous enough to give the server tip because I wouldn't. I would definitely write on the check the reason why I wasn't gonna tip. I feel like every stupid mistake made needs some sort of lesson so it doesn't repeat it self.",

It was a great value for $75 and definitely shareable between two people. The menu states 1-3p, but if this is all you'll be having I would lean towards the 2 people. It featured an array of fresh and delicious seafood from oysters to large shrimp to lobster tail and blue crab meat. In addition, we each had a cocktail... a double gray goose with redbull is $24, so just keep that in mind if ordering premium alcohol. The menu looked very steak centric (it is a steakhouse after all) and the prices seem to be toward the higher end with the likes of SW or CUT. I can't comment on whether or not they are warranted, but they are most definitely not cheap even if they are \"off strip\". The ambiance is romantic and relaxed. The design modern and elegant. They had a live performer who was actually very good and not annoying like most I've encountered. They do have outside seating and Thursday evenings are \"Mingle\" nights until 8pm. We came in around 9pm so we had thankfully missed the crowd, The service is on point and oh and how could I forget their bread basket. Love their pretzel bread!",

We ordered an appetizer, salad, main dish and a side.  We waited over an hour to get our salad after having appetizers. And when our Wagyu Striploin steak for $78.00 finally arrived it was not cooked properly whatsoever. So we waited even longer to have it corrected. Our side of tater tots had 7 tots, a little pricey for $10.00.  I will say the oyster starter, 6 for $18.00, was delicious and fresh and the best thing we had.  The experience was expensive for what we got in return.  Probably not our go to steak house next time at the Red Rock.",

The drinks are good, the food is tasty and cooked fast, and the waitstaff is great.  It is pricey, but as expected at one of the Casino's top restaurants.

    "text": "T-Bones is a beautiful place and elegant place.  I was thrilled to be invited to dinner there, since I'd never been.    First, the good:  the bread might be up there with the best bread I've had in Vegas in the 10+ years I've been here.  Maybe it's an East Coast thing, but I like bread with a crunchy crust, and this had it in spades.  From the beginning to the end:  the creme brulee was outstanding.  But man (or woman, in this case) cannot live by bread and dessert alone, though I wish I could.  I would have been content with both of those.    My appetite was whetted by the beautiful, jumbo shrimp sitting atop ice in a huge bowl brought to our table.  While they looked great, nothing about their taste was remarkable.  They were just THERE.  And as soon as the shrimp were whisked away, the waiters started to remove the bread basket and bread plates of all the others at my table.  I caught them in time; when there's good bread I save a bite for the end of my meal.  Did I play hooky from etiquette class the day they taught this topic?  A very ordinary Caesar's salad was followed by what should have been the raison d'etre of a steak joint:  the steak.  Mine was a petite filet.  It looked like it was cooked just the way I liked it, i.e., medium rare.  Somehow it didn't taste that way.  Actually, it didn't taste like much of anything.  I'm not a huge steak aficionado to begin with, and this one didn't do anything to change my mind.  If I had paid the menu price of $43, I sure would have been ticked.  The green beans were just about raw.  Lots of folks like 'em that way.  I am not one of them.  The mashed potatoes were eminently skippable.    My husband had the salmon, which came out as a thick slab.  It wasn't as rare as it should be, but he likes it well done, so he had no complaints about that.  But it, too, wasn't flavorful, unless you count the excessive amount of salt on the top, almost a salt crust.  Ix-nay on the salmon, too.  We've had great salmon, and this wasn't it.  If we were on our own dime, we would have been sorely disappointed.  Instead, we were just disappointed.",

Unfortunately...  we could barely hear her voice because of the sound system being turned down so low.   I expected her to be the centerpiece of a great night, especially since we sat in the VIP section.   The food was great, but the waitress was busy (rude) and my Rose Brute Champaign came in a warm (out of the dishwasher) glass.   Overall an underwhelming and disappointing experience given the average meal cost of 67.00  per person.   The saving grace of the night was that Cali Tucker took time for pictures while she was on her break!   T-Bones should learn to highlight their strengths and seriously consider retraining their staff to appreciate their customers.",

I've eaten at Ruth Chris, Gallagher's, Fleming's and numerous other steak houses.  The 22 oz bone in ribeye has only one drawback - it's huge.  But tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked - nice sear on the outside and hot and pink next to the bone.  Sides (mashed potato, peas, mushrooms, green salad) were very nice.  Sides are easily big enough to split multiple ways.  Service was excellent and our waiter captain was funny, personable, and eager to attend to all our parties needs.  Everyone else input party of four ordered different things (petite filet, scallops, and fish) and all were extremely satisfied with their meals.  All in all it's a great steak house and highly recommended if you have a hankering for a great piece of meat perfectly cooked and elegantly served.  I'm local and I plan on coming back to try more of their menu.  Be sure and make reservations - it gets busy in the evening.  And Red Rock Casino is a great off strip establishment",

I could go on and on about the issues, but let's just go with the fact that three of us ordered the wildly overpriced sole meuniere ($68).  Huge portion (not normally a bad thing, and definitely typical for Vegas, but a good sole meuniere is thin enough so that it gets crispy around the edges) that was way too thick to cook evenly. Solution? Overcook it! Done.  But, serve it lukewarm for some reason. Why? Dunno.  I'll basically leave it there except some quick notes: brussels sprouts were dry and terrible, salads were pointless, and all the steaks on the table were consumed about 30% since they were just not that good.  On the plus side, the asparagus was actually quite good. And the horseradish that came with the oysters was insanely sharp, which was fun. Oysters were flavorless, but fine. I did ask what type of oysters they were, and the answer? \"West Coast.\" Thanks.",

So, We started off the meal with a basic wedge salad. All good there. Nothing special. The bread was pretty good too. A little bit overkill with the \"Hawaiian volcanic salt\" on the butter, but ok.   We ordered our food. I ordered the filet medium rare. My boyfriend ordered the prime rib medium rare. We got Mac and cheese and green beans as the side.   About 20 minutes later broccoli and two filets arrive at our table. The waiter walks away. What shocked me was not that they got our order wrong but that he came back, took the food and brought it to the correct table. Disturbing.   When we finally got our food, the waiter proceeded to deposit a 10oz bloodied carcass to my boyfriends side of the table. It was cold. Flavorless. Much like canned cat food.   My filet was salty and cold. The kind of filet you'd expect from a hospital cafeteria.   The waiter comes back and says \"everything delicious right?\" My boyfriend then tried to return the kill on his plate to the waiter who took it back with no questions asked.   The waiter then proceeded to ignore us until we asked for our check. We were left to sit and listen to Lana Del Rey cover songs for the next 15 minutes.   I'm very disappointed with this experience and would recommended a multitude of other steakhouses in Las Vegas that are more reasonably priced, better service, and taste a heck of a lot better.",

To be honest, T-Bones can get expensive.  It's priced like a steakhouse on the strip, so the huge ribeye I had tonight was $52.  BUT if you keep your eyes out, there's often deals for locals.  Awhile back Red Rock had a web site that gave me 50% my meals at various points.  Tonight I used a $25 off $50 coupon they had sent me in the mail.  So my $52 ribeye was only $27, which is much more reasonable.  Tonight I sat at the bar and chatted with the beautiful and friendly bar staff.  Almost every woman working in T-Bones is easy on the eyes.  Great service on top, of course.  I'll continue to come back as long as T-Bones keeps sending out deals.",

Menu looked great and was very pricey so I was immediately excited hoping for an incredible meal. We walked in to a beautiful restaurant and received incredible service but the food was tired. Ordered a few starters to share, the steakhouse chopped salad which was average, the grilled asparagus which was over cooked and had no flavor, sweet potato fries which were super greasy and undercooked (soggy) and the Colorado lamb chops which were fatty and tasted gamey. What a shame, WAY too much $ for the quality of food!",

    "text": "My friends and I had reservations, for which we were at least 15 minutes early. However, even with reservations, they didn't have our table prepared and us seated until 15 minutes past our reservation time. No complimentary appetizers or drinks for making us wait??  One person in the group got the grilled salmon, which was small, bland, dry, and worse than anything she could've made at home. Definitely not worth the 35 bucks or however much it costed. Never getting fish at a steakhouse again.  Now, the main reason as to why I'm writing this review, to critique the steak. The number one factor for what makes or breaks a steak for me is FLAVOR, which this 52 dollar steak had NONE of. Sure they had that not so good sauce on the side that you could slather your steak in, but for me, the perfect steak just needs salt and pepper and rubbed with spices. The single redeeming factor is that the meat is truly tender. I rested my fork on it and the prongs started sinking into the meat!  I agree the most with Chad P.'s review. Too bad I didn't listen to him over all the overwhelming 5 star reviews.  Blacklisted",

We ordered wine and our glasses always stayed filled.  They make you feel so important here. I mean, its a pretty pricey place so I'd hope so!  We ordered two filet mignons and a side of mashed potatoes to share. The filets were delicious. Cooked to perfection. They could have been seasoned more but no biggie. The potatoes were amazing. I'm a huge potato fan so that's saying a lot. No gravy needed. Those spuds had some spunk!  Nom nomz.  We were too full for dessert but they brought us a plate of these little raspberry pastries and chocolate pastries. Just little tiny things but there were a lot of them and they were good!  The bill was about $130 after my husband's stations employee discount. High but worth the entire experience. I'll be returning absolutely =)",

    "text": "Now that I'm a tad older, I can appreciate the aesthetics of \"fine dining\" a bit more, from service, decor, to food. There's a certain orchestrated dance that comes with it. Of course you'll pay a pretty penny.   T-bones Chophouse doesn't disappoint regarding decor, a very swag restaurant, from the center fire place, to alcohol decorated lined windows, to the bold art piece that serves as the outside facing wall.   The food was very good. The average \"chop\" will run you between $50 to $60 dollars. The salad and each side are roughly $12. The varieties of artisan-quality breads were exceedingly phenomenal. The chopped salad was exceptional, made with attention. The appetizer Poke runs with the best made in Hawaii, even better regarding presentation. If you're a meat eater, you won't be disappointed as the beef is aged and seasoned well. The sides are equally as nice, as I made special note of the roasted tomatoes.   With decor and food marked as \"A's\", let's move on to the service. While it was by in no means bad, it was under from what you'd expect from a fine establishment. The server was polite and pleasant, which makes it hard to down his service. He didn't seem to be an expert on the menu or rather didn't have much to say when he introduced himself. Orders were taken going around the table, rather than ladies first. His assistant was a bit coarse, his placing and removal of plates were more attuned to a busser at a roadside diner. Our finished meals were left a little too long, as they were a bit slow to clear. Rarely did both check on us, which was noticed by all in our medium size party. We had to look for them and try to catch their attention as they passed by. We had to remind both to fill our glasses, get a forgotten coffee, and missing dessert... more than a couple of occasions. Curiously, the sommelier never offered the cork for inspection. The front of the house manager didn't stop by to act as host, checking on us and chatting a bit. At the end, it was the whole lot of little things that added up to a lack luster service experience. Again, by in no means was it bad, but just inattentive and a lack of refinement. I'll stop here, because I'm beginning to sound hoity-toidy.   With that said we all felt a bit let down by our experience at T-bones Chops. The management should invest in formal professional development of the service staff, putting the \"fine\" in \"fine dining\". There's something great to be said about a well-trained staff, a certain level of confidence and showmanship.   Decor & Food: Top notch!  Service: Think Black Angus Steakhouse  Thumbs up and down. Would I recommend? It's close, but I'd say pass if you're looking for a fine dining experience.",

    "text": "T- Bones is a top tier steakhouse located inside the Red Rock. It's a great hangout for locals that take advantage of their happy hour specials (which are quite special), however, visitors might find it overly expensive and not focus on the total experience.   I came here to celebrate my birthday on the 16th , the hostess was quite accommodating and offered us a choice of tables. I was very hungry and parched (it got hot quick in Vegas),so we quickly sat near the entrance of the restaurant.  The atmosphere is upbeat , we had live music being played a musician on the piano. He was actually so good I thought we were listing to some sort of radio.   The architecture is very modern and clean.Lots of red with dark accents. I saw a previous review mention the large windows in the elevated dining area, the windows are the strangest feature because yes you can see through them to the bar which has TV's and it is distracting.   But TV's are nice if you just want to hang out at the bar. I'm not sure if drapes are the solution, maybe electro-chromatic windows that can be turned on and off depending on which part of the day your in??  I Digress...  Their service is impeccable and we were served by Rick. We quickly ordered drinks and our courses.   Apps: Caesar Salad. Ground anchoive, fresh CRISP romain, fresh parmesan, the dressing had a bit of a kick to it but it was a refreshing kick.   Main Course: T-Bones is always willing to go the extra mile. We ordered a large fillet and some King Crabbie Legs, Rick was kind enough to split it table side.  The Desert: Chessecake from Heaven. This cheesecake is so good,  my Yelp Profile image is now of me eating it. The cheesecake was fluffy and more cake-like cheese, but still had all that amazing sweetness. The crust was extra-thick grahm cracker.....soooo goood.    I will definitely be coming back, I tell my self I need to come in more often every time I am there.  Thats why it got 5 starts: Great Food, Positively Outrageous Service, Stunning Design.",

Once we placed our \"cheapo\" order (we only spent $150 between the 2 of us.. wow we are such cheapskates), the waiter gave us a rude look and disappeared for the night. He literally never came back. Our baked potato was served without any toppings, our water was never refilled.. it was awful. We literally had to hunt someone down 15 minutes after our potato was delivered to ask for some butter and sour cream. UGH.   The worst part was we had a $25 giftcard as part of a package at Red Rock. They took the card, and then the next day when we went to check out, we saw they had made their tip on a $150 meal over $50... they had just applied the gift card to their tip. Are you kidding me? It took waayyyy too much fighting and hassle to get our $25 back. The front desk was rude, didn't believe us, etc, etc.. What a pain!  Overall there are sooo many places in Vegas to eat an average steak (like Hugo's for instance), you might as well eat at one with good service too! If you want an amazing jaw dropping steak, there are plenty of places for that as well (Craftsteak, Strip Steak, etc, etc). Why settle for an average steak in a crappy place? What's the point?",

Upon arriving the snotty woman at the front told me and my son in law that hats are not allowed. Really? I asked her if my ball cap made my money worthless and she acted like I was a homeless person! We left because I will not pay for overpriced food and have a restaurant tell me what I can or can't wear. What's next...no tattoos, facial hair, jewelry or striped shirts? The dude that owns this crappy restaurant should swallow his pride and allow the masses eat there. Dude....it's Vegas! There are steakhouses on every corner! No wonder your restaurant has 3 stars! Maybe it will close soon since there are other great steak houses in town. Great name also...T-Bones? Really? Not a lot of thought on that one! Maybe you could hire someone with a college education with a major in marketing to come up with a better name. I will never make or go to this crappy restaurant ever again! Everyone beware they will try and mold you into something your not and charge you an arm and a leg!!!",

For such an expensive steakhouse, I can't even believe they keep people like this employed. The wait staff was descent. The food was descent. Although the Japanese Waygu for $30 an ounce, not worth it. My filet was so much better. To be honest I will never go here again. The service, price and and quality is far superior at Capitol Grill. The horrid hostess ruined the experience for my sons birthday which was why we were there. Never again!",

    "text": "I recently went to T bones as an invite to enjoy their happy hour with friends to celebrate my birthday in great company. I was so happy to spend time with my friends, but the experience soon started to go down hill for a couple of reasons. 1. A friend of mine had a coupon voucher that she wanted to use that evening. She called ahead of time and was told she could absolutely utilize it. When she tried to do so, she was told there were restrictions on where she could use it (on the patio vs inside the dining area or bar). Perhaps this is just my opinion, but why send out an advertising lure into your establishment with all the headache? 2. Because it was the Memorial Holiday, the Happy Hour priced menu wasn't in effect, even though they'd given us this menu to order from with HH pricing. 3. While sitting with my friends at bar seating, someone who appeared to be a manager, asked two of the guys in my party to remove their hats. This rule or request could have been brought to their attention before entering at the hostess desk so as to not treat diners like children. Truly for me, it was just one thing after another at this place. They weren't that busy and rather than enjoy the nice surroundings, I noticed the importance of their bottom line that night more than anything. It was a unique and memorable experience, but not one I care to repeat.",

The burger was delicious and juicy.   The hostess' are very friendly and welcoming and the servers are fast, friendly and accurate.   The interior is very pretty and the bar area is really nice.

I'm not here to write reviews or recommend those places as I'm simply here to review this place. 4 stars. All around, from the ambiance to greetings at the door, drinks, app, entrees, dessert and cashing out. Our steak came out cold, it had to get sent back, which of course re heating it makes it more cooked. Also asked for no bleu cheese on salad, and they forgot to eliminate that. Simple errors but for the price you're paying you expect near perfection. Their bread is phenomenal though. I think our table tried one of each, and we loved them all! Wine list is good not great. Like I said, if I was in the area craving a good steak I'd go... but wouldn't go out of my way, as it's nothing exciting especially for the price.",

Others in the party ordered fish and prime rib meals. Everyone ordered sides such as corn, mushrooms, asparagus, and potatoes.    The fish was the hit at the table while the ribeye and prime rib looked great but were both very dry and not as flavorful as anticipated.  The sides were all delicious and enough for 2-3 people.  My only reservation about T-Bones is that it is a bit too overpriced for the food that was presented.  I know that is part of the Vegas steakhouse expectation but if this is the case, fish should never beat out the steaks on the table.  I will give it another shot because I do love a good steak!",

Venue is way too loud for a nice steakhouse. Hard to have a conversation with your meal which is annoying. Onto the food... Started with the Steakhouse salad that I've always enjoyed and it was virtually tasteless :( (Romaine, Avocado, Gorgonzola, Tomato, Applewood Bacon, White French Dressing).  Moved on to my all-time favorite... crab cocktail.  It was excellent as usual. The Dijon aioli is fantastic - a little spicy and a perfect balance to the crab.  Had a bowl of their French onion soup topped with a gruyere toast is absolutely not-to-miss.  Finished with an oversold carrot cake which was dry and topped with a cream frosting that was thick and lacked the benefit of proper sweetening.",

I cannot express how immensely disappointed with this restaurant we all were. I wish we had read the reviews about the wait time before. We knew it was going to be expensive, so were prepared for that, but everything else was beyond a joke.  The staff were pretentious and unfriendly. They made no effort to accommodate the children we had with us, and had no idea about serving food for young kids.  We waited over an hour and a half to get food, and that was despite chasing up with the staff several times. By the time it eventually arrived, one child had fallen asleep, and the others were so tired and upset they couldn't face eating. And to make things worse, the size of the children's portions were gigantic. Two of them burst into tears upon seeing their cheeseburger because it was so big they were scared to even attempt to eat it. The food for the adults in our party wasn't anything special, certainly not worth the over-inflated prices they were charging.  Although we complained about the service, the server still insisted we paid a mandatory 20% gratuity. We spoke with a manager at the door, who promised to take care of the bill after we had reluctantly paid, however, over a week later I have yet to receive any form of a refund.  My suggestion: if you're ever in this part of Vegas, eat at the Yard House or LBS Burger, avoid T-Bones. You have been warned.",

We arrived at 730 for our reservation and the hostess seated us within 5 minutes.  We brought a bottle of Sea Smoke Pinot Noir as it is one of my favorite wines. After being seated the waiter asked if we would like to open our wine, we excitedly said yes! A few moments later the \"wine expert\" came over and said we were not allowed to open our bottle since they had it on their wine list. I was completely shocked as I called before and the operator said the corkage fee was $35 with no other stipulations. Additionally, their website does not offer their wine list to look over or indicate this was not allowed. After a few moments, I went to the \"wine expert\" and said what a ridiculous situation this was and he didn't care. He would not allow us to open our wine at the restaurant since they had it on their wine list. I was willing to spend upwards of $300-$400 on dinner alone but they would not let me open my wine. We sat at our table for a few moments and ultimately decided to take our business elsewhere. The way I was treated was absolutely pathetic and I will never be subject to that service again. I am really disappointed since I really like many aspects of the restaurant. Every restaurant I have been to in town allows a corkage fee(including T-Bones), only T-Bones restricts it to wines not on their wine list. Funny since T-Bones claims to have a 7500 bottles in their cellar. From a Casino that \"Loves their Locals\", I find this an opposing view.   On the contrary, we took our business to Flemings on Charleston and received exceptional food and service. I appreciate their willingness to charge us a corkage fee of $20 for our bottle of wine. Thank you Flemings for your great food and service  Erik, 608-516-4111",

The bartender finished her conversation then moseyed over to the couple and retrieved the empty plates. Meanwhile I sat with an empty wine glass trying to get the other bartender's attention. The lack of service continued through dinner. A woman who I believe was the bar manager did come by eventually and the other couple complained to her and she apologized.

Live music is very good and just adds to the atmosphere. Drinks are generous and always served with a smile. The bread..........GET THE BREAD.

But I wouldn't want my friends or family to come out of pocket at this place. Nor would I spend my own money here.   I've tried eating here four times, and though the food was good...sometimes it came out in waves - some people were served while others waited. Sometimes it took a long, long time for our table to get the food. Such a long time that you go from being hungry to  being over it. And P.O.ed. And the prices are just too high for the dinner not to be \"perfectish.\"  Food servers are friendly. The steak is excellent. The decor is lovely. But it's just not worth it.",

    "text": "T-Bones is the best steak on the westside bar none. The grass fed filet is excellent and they have a nice selection of Kobe as well.  I've been coming here for years and one interesting and unfortunate thing is that when T-Bones has something that works - they like to change it (LOL). They used to have a few \"best in class\" items, that they've \"reimagined\" into mediocrity, but still, this place is very, very good.  Some standouts are the creamed corn, the truffle tater tots, their great wine selection, and of course the steaks. Their buttermilk fried chicken with sage gravy is the best fried chicken you will find anywhere on the planet.  If you order their mashed potatoes, order them with sour cream and chive mixed in - amazing!  For dessert, the fried oreos are both novelty - and surprisingly awesome. Even better and more decadent though is the hot toffee cake. They used to have an AMAZING chocolate cake, but have since replaced it with a replacement that sadly wouldn't stand up to supermarket quality scrutiny.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. This is overall a really great place!",

    "text": "This was a total disaster. I do monthly dinners for groups of 10-25 of my clients in town from around the country. This month I had the dinner at T-Bones as I using the hotel for my guests. This was due to SEMA being in town and my normal facility was booked. Normally I use the Silverton and Twin Creeks Steak House. I was looking forward to the change of venue as I eat at the Twin Creeks monthly.  This was a beyond disappointing. The facility is very nice and has a nice private room that holds about 20. I had a smaller group of 15 so it was plenty of room. I was running about 30 minutes late and was more than a little surprised when I showed up and that everyone was still without appetizers or even bread baskets. I ordered a drink and greeted guests. I would say 10 more minutes and my drink arrived and then it was about ordering appetizers (45 minutes after people had arrived). I thought that was way too long to make people wait.  Well we ordered dinner and skipped appetizers because people were getting hungry at this point. I like to wrap up about 930-10 and at this rate we would be there till 11. One server and one busser was all that was allocated to our table and I am sure they had other tables outside this area as well because it was slow service.   One drink later and another 45 minutes the food arrived. Presentation was terrible on the steaks. I should have taken a picture of it as it was actually funny. Two small semi crisped tomatoes on a plate with a New York Steak. They all looked the same. Just lazy looking. Why garnish it at all? A steak would have been presented alone just fine. People were actually laughing which is not a good sign. So I had ordered the blackened halibut. It came with a type of spice on it (wasn't sure what it was). It tasted okay, but was overpowering of the fish to say the least. I didn't mind the spice taste, however the fish was overcooked. It was dry and and seared more that a third through. Clearly indicating it had been left on too long. I chewed my way through it which was uneventful. I had also ordered Broccoli and mushrooms as side dishes.   Side dishes: This was just ridiculous. Numerous people ordered the broccoli with hollandaise sauce  and literally the serving size was massive. The server should have made the corrections knowing that we had just ordered enough broccoli to serve 20-25 people. So it arrived, steamed. I mean steamed. Nothing else. It came with a sauce which they didn't bring until 10 minutes later after having to ask for it (meaning they forgot it on numerous orders). It was steamed and not even close to worth the $10 as I literally could have made this in 5 minutes at home. I love steamed veggies but this was so plain and massive it seemed wrong.  Overall I saw three of my people with steaks that were done wrong. Medium was well done. I mean done! Torched. Another was medium rare, was a plate full of blood. I cant imagine a $60 steak looking so poorly but it was right there for me to witness over and over again. I sampled my girlfriends New York. Cooked too long, but more importantly a grisly tough steak. I swear a NY from Albertsons was better quality.  I probably wouldn't be so harsh in this review if I was at a place that was priced accordingly . This however was almost worth calling Vegas Metro and filing a theft report. It was low quality ingredients, low quality service, and prepared lazily without expertise. I am not a food snob at all and mostly eat in Chinatown and often look past the lawn furniture decor and such to have exciting and well prepared meals. This was the opposite, as if not to notice the food was terrible the decor and price tried to impress you. I am not impressed even the least.   Now the BEST PART of this experience was a day later when at least three of us came down with unexplained bowel movement issues. This place was a colon cleanser for at least 3 guests and who knows didn't admit this fact. Either food poisoning or low quality food preparation put my clients and crew riding the porcelain chariot all for the price of $110 per head.   To say the least I will remember this experience however not one to repaeat.",

I am happy to say that this outing was much better with T Bones delivering an excellent meal, terrific service and a nice atmosphere. Suggest you skip New Years Eve and other event dates here and stick with normal week nights and weekends!  For appetizers, my wife tried the Big Eye Tuna Poke and I had the fresh oysters.  The tuna poke was delicious with very fresh tuna and wonderful flavors. The fresh oysters were particularly good, some of the freshest oysters I've had in a while in Las Vegas.   Next we ordered the grass fed filet mignon for my wife and the aged prime NY strip for me. Again, both were delicious steaks, seared perfectly with a nice crust and cooked exactly to our specifications.  We also had grilled asparagus and potatoes au gratin for sides.   T Bones exceeded our expectations and I can recommend this restaurant without hesitation. In fact, much easier to get a great steak here than fight the crowds on the Strip.",

Our steaks were cooked exactly as requested.  Very flavorful and tasty with a nice crust.  The caesar salad was nothing more than ordinary.  We had a side dish of truffle tater tots -- nice and hot and crusty, but lacking any hint of truffles.  Now, the disappointing part.  The place is elegant with lots of glass, roaring fireplace, and all the other trappings of a fine dining establishment, but the noise level was way above distraction.  On the very top of the decibel level, was the droning voice of a live vocalist which only made it worse.  At our first seating, we were given a table that separated us apart by four feet.  We had to shout to each other to be heard.  We noticed an empty booth near the opposite wall and asked to be re-seated.  They offered a smaller table instead, which was an improvement, but did not solve the sense of intimacy or the level of  loud noise.  If you're just interested in very good food, this is the place.  But, if you expect more than that for your top dollar, look elsewhere.",

I really like the atmosphere and style of the restaurant itself. The big fireplace on the left side makes it feel cozy, the high ceilings and their outdoor bar is the best place to have a beverage or 7 in all of Red Rock.   I noticed a lot of complaints about the prices in other Yelp reviews. Here are some ways to keep dinner under some kind of budget:   1. Skip the appetizers completely. Let's be honest. There's nothing you haven't had before here. Crab cakes, caprese salad, oysters, shrimp cocktail..zzzzzzzzzzzzz. And there's no way they'll do it better than your favorite place anyways. The bread is good enough here if you're starving.   Plus you're at a freakin steakhouse for chrissakes! I for one always end up getting tons of things boxed up since the portions are so big. Why stuff yourself with pricey and meh things?   2. Go with the Chateaubriand for $99. Its a complete dinner for 2 and it comes with a rainbow of roasted vegetables and potatoes. That means you don't need to pay for $10 side dishes.   On a side note, it continually blows my mind how any steakhouse charges $10+ for steamed asparagus. Good god! I want them to at least work a little bit on the damn vegetable. Grill it!! Sautee it!! Show me the chef put some elbow grease into it. It's simply wrong on principle alone to spend that much on steamed anything unless it's a whole fish.   Like any real restaurant that serves Chateaubriand, they will cook the beef tenderloin table-side, carve it and plate it in front of you. Its like the soft rock music of steak to teppenyaki's heavy metal. The presentation could also be potentially semi-impressive if you're on a first date. Just throwing that out there.   The tenderloin itself is good enough and enjoyable. No way can it compare to some other places in town but it still makes for a nice steak dinner.   3. You could also keep it cheap for dessert by going to the Grand Cafe or Ben and Jerry's in the food court. Neither of which we did since we were so stuffed from the entree but there's another suggestion.   I would only come back here for a proper dinner if I had a significant discount. There are too many other cows in the sea.",

My friend had the mushroom tart which was actually good. Only complaint there was the crust - the bottom was soggy. They probably didn't cook it first or it sat too long.  For the next round of apps I got the kale salad and she had the duck prosciutto. I had their old kale salad & thought that was what I was ordering. I was wrong. It is now a fried kale salad. Yuck! Fried kale with some cauliflower, raw onions, and red chilies sprinkled on top. It was oily and gross. I'm Not sure who even made up this recipe. It was inedible. Fried kale is a garnish, not a salad.  Service was ok, not great. None of them said a word when I returned an entire plate of uneaten kale.   I won't make an effort to go back.",

Service was mediocre at best, we waited a good while on the bartender to even acknowledge our presence. She was too busy chatting with other people who sat at the bar after us. We then not only had to wait on placing an order, but had to listen to them chat as if there was no one else at the bar. Which in fact was quite busy. Only after setting them up with small plates, silverware, drinks, then water, does she make a move to get our order. By this time we decided against eating there based on the service.  One drink and then we were out of there. Even then, we had to wait to find someone to get us our check. Doubt we will return.",

Lots of empty tables and we were stuffed in the back room where they have parties.  Totally lost any kind of ambiance we could of experienced.   -Ordered appeizer/salad/steak/scallops/sides...... -Took over an hour for any food to come out -When the food came out it was not even tasty.  I ordered my steak medium well, it came out charred on one side, raw in the middle, and medium well on the other side. -I have eaten at many nice steak places and this place would be out done by a simple Morton's, Del Frisco's, or even Fleming's.  The cut of meat was poor.   -Scallops were not good.  -The price to quality is very far off -I barely ate the steak and the bread guy wondered why I wasn't taking this home to eat -Also was seated near people with tons of screaming children, we were looking for a nice romantic evening out....being stuffed in this small room with screaming children was not the idea -Blaring music on the speakers....couldn't hear my boyfriend talking over that and the screaming children   I would definitely not come here again.  3 hour dining experience from hell.",

I feel like there's nothing like cooked, dead animal meat and T-Bones Chophouse does it just like I like it!  It's also about the service which is most excellent. I like feeling like I'm spoiled or like I'm royalty. It was like the servers could read my mind because I didn't have to ask for things - they just anticipated my wants and or needs and presented them as options and let me choose.   As for the food - I love the shredded salad. I love the sides. I love the steak and I love the drinks. They truly do cater to your whims and they seem to really take pride in what and how they serve what they do.   T-Bones is one of my favorite steak houses in Las Vegas. I know there are others and they're as good, if not better but I like being off the strip, avoiding the crowds and the traffic.",

As a vegetarian, I was impressed with the sweet potato, grilled asparagus, and mushroom sides. My coworker ordered the halibut (the only wild caught fish on the menu, per our server), but was dismayed that it was as dry as chalk and not very flavorful.   The service was friendly except for one bus girl. She gave our table dirty looks the whole night and was not very responsive when asked for things. As dinner wound down, she grabbed the sides of butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon along with the sweet potato that were in front of me without asking if I was done and/or if I wanted them wrapped, and when I hastily said, \"Oh! Will you please wrap those for me?!\" I received yet another dirty look. When she was finished, I enjoyed the reluctant \"plop\" of the to-go containers on the ground next to me.   She then went on to grab the asparagus and mushrooms from the table, and when I repeated my same request, she gave an indication that she understood. Unfortunately, though, even though she had said \"ok\", those dishes never did make it back to me and that food was obviously wasted.  Super disappointed with this experience and I do not have plans to return.",

They seem to have good intensions & smile a lot but not knowing what they should be doing back there. This leads to long wait times and confusion.  The food at the bar, should they remember to ask if you need a menu is a small one but excellent taste & presentation . Getting a drink can be on time but not necessary. Any questions about a wine etc gets a similar deer on head lights unless it's a very popular  one So enjoy and prepare to coach those behind the bar to keep pace with you",

A hidden gem on the menu , yet most don't pay attention to, is the buttermilk fried chicken.  Outstanding!!! Truly a must try when dining at TBones.

Guess they wanted to make sure we could see how hard they were working. The chestnut soup was divine. You could actually smell the truffles and they reminded me of my last vacation in Spoleto, but the steak when it FINALLY arrived... the $64 ribeye that was supposed to be medium RARE came out not only just medium, but very DRY and not even barely warm to the touch! After mentioning it to the waiter in hopes of getting some steak sauce, the manager came over and very nicely asked if they could make me another one. I told her, \"No thanks. I had to wait so long for this one and I need to eat now because of my blood sugar.\" So the waiter suggested a red wine reduction sauce to try and it was delicious, but after working through the tenderest part of the ribeye, I was just too tired to chew any longer. Needless to say, my sister in law's dogs enjoyed what was one of  the most disappointing steaks I've ever had. Word of advice, if you walk into a fancy restaurant and they seat you right in front of the kitchen door, TAKE THE HINT. I certainly \"get it\" now. Guess I should have ordered the Prime Rib. At least it wouldn't have been too dry. Disappointing to say the least. Won't bother going back. Maybe we'd be more welcome at the Sun Coast next time.",

The quality of the food, preparation, service, and atmosphere was all excellent and we couldn't be more happy with what we received.   Located inside the main casino in Red Rock Hotel, where my sister and her family were staying, there was a half hour wait at 8:30 pm. There was an option to sit at the bar and order from the full menu, but I thought if we were paying full price we wanted full dining table options. It was nice to have that option, though, and there was a musician playing in the bar area. This was actually a good thing, as I suggested we wait at the casino bar and I could try to make some money at the blackjack tables to pay for dinner.  15 min later and about $500 more in my pocket then before, we were stoked!   We were seated in the main dining room, next to a central fireplace in a glass display, which added beautiful ambience.  The menu is awesome, and has an excellent variety of steaks, salads, chops, and seafood.  For appetizers we had the Kitchen Sink Caesar Salad, which as its name implies has a lot of ingredients (no meat).  It has Shrimp, Avocado, Tomato, Hearts of Palm, and served with an awesome Spicy Horseradish Dressing. We also got a complimentary assortment of bread which included pretzel bread and crispy flat bread that was most memorable.    For entrees I got the 22 oz bone rib eye which was cooked to perfection and incredibly tender. The other steaks came out just as tender and delectable.  Highly flavorful and juicy, every bite was amazing.  We also ordered the fully loaded baked potato which we split, creamed corn, and brussels sprouts.  Service, as mentioned, was excellent, and they came to fill our drinks regularly.  When we left, they packed our food and even gave us extra bread as we saved some of our dinner for my niece and nephew who ordered room service.  They loved the steaks too.  Highly recommended, will come again.",

The decor is awesome, there's live music, we love love love their fresh bread, and butter with a volcanic salt. My husband always gets the lobster bisque, and I opt for the french onion soup. We will share a bone in rib eye and share a few sides. The corn rocks and I am partial to the Brussels sprouts. All of the potatoe options are excellent.

She was great is giving me the cucumber martini with gin that I wanted and was very helpful. She helped me with a dispute of cocktails bc I'm allergic to vodka so she was sure to give me gin. I'm always careful and watch the bartenders when making my drinks bc if that issue of getting sick .. but she was very professional in handling the situation. We will def be back to visit her and her New York State of mind. Thanks for the great service!!   Food was amazing we had shared the wedge salad, short ribs and sliders and crab cakes. Everything was amazing. It was worth the wait. Crab cakes are delish and full of crab",

Come to realize the hostess claimed me as a no show to Open table through an email. I got sick of waiting for the hostess to show me to my table, so I ate a fantastic steak with cheesecake to follow at the bar, accompanied by the adorable personality of bartender Nicole. Thanks for saving my birthday girl. Cheers!",

First off, I think the build out and location of the restaurant is incredible. I love the Red Rock set-up in general, and this restaurant is built to maximize the best of the property views.   I had a meeting in here, we had a couple drinks at the bar and the bartender(cute girl from NY/NJ) ended up keeping us there for dinner. She was spectacular, took great care of us, excellent cocktails and helped with menu choices. The food was perfect, wouldn't change a thing from my order.. Joe's Stone Crab and Prime is still my favorite in Vegas but this is a close 2nd for me.  Absolutely will return",

    "text": "Food and drink in short was average at best. Most definitely over priced as well for the service and quality your getting.  However that is not the reason for this bad review. The most concerning thing is that both myself and my buddy that was at the bar with me had the same issue within 5 minutes of each other closing out the tab. That problem being them double dropping the check. We had purchased 4 drinks and closed the tab out. Then I Ordered two appetizers and the girl at the counter pushes me a check for 108 bucks!!!! I guess she thought I was intoxicated bc when I confronted her she said, ow I thought you wanted one more drink? What ok even if that's your back story why is it 80 bucks worth of stuff on my tab??? Finally she gives me another bill for 28 bucks. And says ow the first amount was never charged to your card. I look at my credit card history and indeed there is a charge of 108 plus the 28 bucks. So now I have been charged 136 bucks for two sub par apps. What really you guys are stealing from customers now???? I will be disputing this charge and attempting to reach the manager whom was suppose to have handled this when I spotted the issue. The even more sketchy thing is my buddy 5 minutes later down the bar had the exact same thing happen.   Check your receipt before you leave and I wonder if this is criminal if they show a pattern of this with a large number of customers?  Really shocking for a Red rock resturant.",

The refire makes it dry. I just simply refused to eat. My meal was totally ruined. When your paying 60 or more for a steak, it should be right. I refused to speak to the manager because it would further disturb my company. My check wasn't even comped for all their mess ups. I wasn't charged for the steak, however there should've been some kind of show of regret for sending me away hungry! Do not recommend this place.",

First the staff is excellent.  They don't miss a thing.  We started out with the seafood tower that was plentiful fresh and a great choice. We both had a NY Strip that was grilled to perfection. The asparagus and mushroom sides were a perfect compliment and we're large portions.  We were too full for dessert but it looked amazing.  The wine list was top notch.  This us a must in Vegas",

    "text": "We have been meaning to try T-Bones for quite a few years, but with so many steakhouses in Las Vegas, this one was always overlooked.  We finally decided to come here for a belated birthday dinner for my husband and a last dinner for my mom before she heads back to Michigan.  My husband started with: CAESAR SALAD $12 Classic Caesar or Kitchen Sink w/Shrimp, Avocado, Tomato, Hearts of Palm $6 *He ordered it the \"kitchen sink\" way.  OMG!  Best.salad.ever.  The dressing is with a horseradish base instead of an anchovy base.  It was fabulous!  Truth be told- I wish I would have ordered this as my meal.  You go to a steakhouse and you order steak, right?  With that being said- I expect the steaks to be cooked to perfection.  My mom and I both ordered: PRIME Wet aged for a minimum of 28 days PETITE FILET MIGNON* Greater Omaha 8 oz $39 *We both ordered the steaks cooked to medium.  They came out medium rare/rare.  Now I would MUCH rather have my steaks under-cooked than overcooked, but I'm one to NEVER send anything back.  Was the steak good?  Sure.  Is it my favorite steak?  Not even close.  My husband ordered: WAGYU RIB EYE CAP* Snake River Farms Boise, Idaho 8 oz $52 *OMG!  This was soooo good!  It had a nice crispy sear on the outside and if you know wagyu beef, then you know its like buttah!  YUM!   Our sides: Creamed Spinach $10 *My favorite is still from Ruth's Chris Steak House.  This was good.  Garlic Mashed Potatoes $10 *These were yummy and the garlic was not overpowering!  Would I come back?  Definitely for the salad and that wagyu beef!",

This nightly happy hour runs from 5-7PM and includes a large menu of $5 appetizers and drinks.  As bonus, the cocktail waitresses and female bartenders in their slinky black dresses and high heels are drop dead gorgeous.  There were also 4-6 suits milling about whose function I never figured out so they must be management.    We started off with drinks; Ann chose Peaches (4.5 Sips out of a possible 5) (absolute peach vodka, Pama Pomegranate liqueur, elderflower syrup, fresh peaches, Rock Candy syrup, fresh line and a sugar rim) while I chose the Blue Mojito Devil (4 Sips) (Bacardi Razz, Hiram Walker blue Curacao, fresh blueberries and fresh mint topped with club soda).  We than shared the TBones Steakhouse salad; a large portion of romaine lettuce, bacon, avocado, gorgonzola cheese, tomatoes and white French dressing.  (3.5 Forks)  Our third order included a glass of Rodney Strong merlot and Chicken Pot Pie for Ann while I chose The Cocktail You Gave Me Last Time; Montecristo 12 year rum infused with fresh pineapples, vanilla beans, cinnamon, pineapple juice and brown sugar topping (3.5 Sips) and Beef on Weck; a healthy heap of prime rib sliced thin on a roll served with French Fries, au jus and 3 horseradish sauces (3.5 Forks).   The bill for our drinks ($20) exceeded our food ($15), but it was all covered, minus a $6 gratuity, by Ann's points.",

We decided to make reservations and just walk around the casino and explore and shop.   I have to say that when we went into the restaurant, it was a beginning of a Wonderful dining experience!  Everything was PERFECT!  The service, ambience, staff... We were put in the private dining area and they opened up the curtains which showed the outside pool area that they were getting ready for the night life!  Beautiful!   The food was out of this world! Al A Carte but worth it! Filet, melts in your mouth.  T-Bone, cooked perfectly!  The Porterhouse was AMAZING!  Just Everything was excellent.

To enjoy a salad with dinner was an additional 14-18.00 Want a potato or veggie? Have to order it as a side... and how proud they are of them. Listen- we attended this dinner because it was a very special occasion- I found it to be very pretentious. One of those ridiculous \"tiny meal\" places where they charge exorbitant prices for the privilege of sitting in their booths. The food is not over the top, it is average- something you can find anywhere in Vegas, off the strip. Company we kept was awesome- you know who you are- was it nice to be somewhere and pay over the top for that? Yes.",

    "text": "We just returned from a wonderful vacation from the Red Rock Casino.  Wanted to treat ourselves to a nice steak dinner so we went to T--Bones. The food was delicious but definitely too much. The menu is pretty pricey, and after trying to decide on steak or seafood, the waiter suggested the Surf and Turf. So we ordered it.  Lots of food - a 12oz lobster tail, and an 8oz filet.  I had a wedge salad, my husband had the french onion soup.  The surf and turf came with steamed veggies. Couldn't order any desert, too full. We asked for our bill - surprise!  $381 for 2! The surf and turf was $120 a plate (wasn't listed on the menu), and salad and soup was ala carte. We had the waiter pack up our leftover steak and veggies and took back to our room, no refrigeration, it was still good the next day for breakfast. Waiters - you need to ask your patrons if this is their first time at T-Bones, and let people know when something can be shared. Not the entree but the salads, sides, etc.  Good thing I won the Royal Flush so we could pay for this!",

    "text": "T-bones is located in the Red Rock Hotel & Casino. The restaurant is just inside the doors to the right after you walk in from the East parking garage.  It is an upscale dining establishment with cloth napkins and table cloths, but you can dress casually if you choose to do so. They have an elegant dining area and a nice selection of wines to choose from. As expected from a high end steak house it is fairly expensive. The service is excellent. The entire staff is extremely welcoming and friendly from the time you walk through the door until the time you leave.  They offer a nice selection of different cuts of meat. The only thing I was disappointed with was only the filet was grass fed. All of the other cuts of meat were just prime cuts that are dry aged. I felt that they should offer more of a selection of grass fed beef for the prices they charge.  All of the menu items are ala carte. I had the 22 ounce bone-in ribeye (rare) for $58, Big-eye Tuna Poke, Kale Salad, and the Grilled Tomatoes.  The 22 ounce bone-in ribeye was supposed to be cooked rare. It was a little over cooked. It was more medium-rare than rare. The steak had excellent flavor and had consistent marbling through out the steak. It was definitely an excellent cut of beef. I would say that it was an excellent steak, even though I would have preferred it to be grass fed.  The Big-eye Tuna Poke appetizer was outstanding. The tuna was very fresh. The poke was set over avocado and seaweed. It was drizzled with  sweet soy reduction that was also outstanding.  The Kale Salad had some crunchy kale chips mixed in the salad with walnuts, gorgonzola cheese, and a raspberry vinaigrette dressing. This was an excellent choice from the salad menu. The salad had great flavor.  The side of grilled tomatoes with spinach was pretty good. I think the tomatoes could have been grilled longer, unless they were just put in the oven then that would explain why they did not look grilled.  Overall it was an enjoyable dining experience and I would definitely recommend dining here.",

No one asked us if we wanted a second drink or anything. Our food only came partial and we had to ask a server to check on the rest of meal.

    "text": "Yelp 100 Challenge 2016, #4 of 100 When visiting the Red Rock Resort take a minute and check out T-bones. If not for dinner stop and have a drink or enjoy their happy hour. The restaurant is very nice and trendy inside. You do not need to be dressed formally but it's okay to dress up. When we visit during the summer months I will wear shorts and shirt or jeans and a shirt are acceptable as well any other time of the year. I recommend making a reservation on Open Table; I love racking up the points. If you can ask for Table 23, it is supposed to be one of the top tables in the restaurant. Also, give yourself a good 2 hours when dining here. I think of it like going to the movies and take it in as an experience.   I am finally writing a review for T-bones and this is was my 8th time dining here. Every visit has been phenomenal. We always receive excellent service from every staff member. It starts as soon as you enter the door to the moment you leave.  On this most recent visit we went in to celebrate my wife's birthday. We skipped out on wine and went for cocktails. The wife had several Cantaloupe martinis and I went with 3 Isaac Newtons (old fashioned meets Manhattan), they were $16 each. Once you sit down they serve you a variety of breads. I love the pretzel bread. They will bring more if requested. There are plenty of appetizers to choose from so you may need to skip on the bread. As an appetizer I selected the Seafood Jackpot. It was a jackpot for me because I love me some seafood. There are plenty of oysters, king crab, jumbo shrimp, etc., this will set you back about $75; if you are eating here you are probably not worried about the price but I think it's good to know. I think my wife had some of the crab but I ate most of it around 90% of it. I'm such a pig.   The wife loves the Hearts of Palm salad. Lots of avocado and all the good stuff. The salad can be shared but it is served for one. Wife went with the 18 oz bone-in filet and I had the Wagyu 10 oz striploin. It was a lot of red meat so be prepared. For the sides we shared the corn, asparagus, and a sweet potato. We could have stopped with the corn and asparagus. The sweet potato was out of this world delicious. I do not think I have ever tasted a sweet potato cooked so perfectly.   All of the food was cooked to perfection. I love visiting T-bones and I love the service. The \"Captain\", Darlene went above and beyond making our meal memorable and enjoyable. Roni was another member who helped us out and she gave us phenomenal service. The staff was so nice and personable. We had several staff members including the manager stop by to wish my wife a happy birthday. They all helped make my wife feel a little more special on her very special day. I would like to thank T-bones and the Red Rock Resort for the excellent service and food. I cannot wait to go back. Happy eating!",

My favorite was the Lavash with melted Parmesan. I started off with a French onion soup, the broth was very tasty & not too salty. However, I would've appreciated some more melted cheese around the edges. The crabcakes were phenomenal. Lots of fresh crab! Just the way it should be. I ordered hot tea, peach tranquility. The tea itself had a very good taste to it. But, for some reason it just wouldn't stay hot. It came with its own very own teapot. I did have to ask for a new cup twice. They were happy to provide for me. I got the prime rib. I asked for it to be well done & charred. It was very delicious & flavorful. Their potatoes au gratin were amazing. They add a little bit of bacon to  them. For dessert, we got an apple pie a la mode with a caramel sauce. It was pretty good, although it was lacking that very delicious flaky crust. Instead, it was more of a cracker. I appreciate them wanting it to be different. But, it was a little too different for me. I think next time, I will get their specialty which are the Fried Oreos. Overall, I did like the food and service.",

First of all, it took FOREVER for a bartender to pay attention to us and it was not very busy.  We finally ordered and again, it took forever to get our drinks. That's bc the order never went in and no one was making them.  It seemed to be a miscommunication between bartenders bc when they finally figured it out a different bartender took over and she was on top of things.  The drink menu is limited and very expensive. The bartender showed us the happy hour menu and said we could order anything from it as well and just double the price...the martinis on happy hour were $17...so $34!?!? Yikes.  We just ended up ordering simple drinks and thankfully those were made well.",

Bread before dinner was amazing, not sure if that's a reason to go but it could be.  Steak was good - got the New York \"supreme oscar\" style which involves lobster chunks (fair amount too).  Was cooked perfect and tasted great though thinking back it was probably similar to what you might get a Flemmings which is also a great place and more affordable.  Service was good as well.    Anyway reason I knocked off a star is there seemed to be several issues.  Table next to us had a manager over for several minutes discussing some problem with the food (which the individual did not touch).  Later, different table appeared to send back a dessert - which was then replaced.  And my own lovely wife ordered her filet medium rare and received it not just rare but basically raw in the middle.  So she had to have them refire it (which they did).  But that's 3 quality control issues I saw in my brief hour + of dining and for this kind of money I think that should give one pause.",

    "text": "I can't imagine why this place has so many positive reviews. It's a steakhouse that serves subpar steak. My only guess is that in the immediate area (Red Rock Casino) there aren't a ton of choices and it's the only high-end restaurant in that immediate area.   The service: if there's such a thing as being \"overly\" serviced, this place would be it. The waitstaff tag-teams the tables. This means we had a waiter/waitress team. Good right? Wrong. This just meant we were bugged every five minutes for the same things. Yes, our wine is fine. Seriously, it's fine. We already indicated what kind of water we wanted (and they got it wrong since the first person to ask forgot what we said) when the second person asked. No, we don't want dessert. We've already said that. It was seriously annoying after a while. If the team is going to tag-team, they should communicate.  We asked the waitress if there was anything off-menu and she said \"no\". After we placed our order, we noticed a card on the table. We turned it around and there was a winter special - off-menu. Serious fail.   We both had the french onion soup (very good, the only good part of the meal). I had the grass-fed petite filet and my husband had a bone-in Kansas strip steak. My filet was so over-salted that it tasted like a salt lick and I couldn't finish it (it was 8 ounces, small enough to finish). It had a very hard crust. My husband's steak was very fatty with not much meat.   The atmosphere is very loud (particularly with poor live music going on through the dining room). When the music started the talking got louder. The fireplace in the middle of the room added some nice ambiance but the loudness due to the music/competing talking was off-putting. Don't be fooled by what yelp says - it says this place is dressy but everyone was in jeans. Not a problem for us but if you decide to go (and I wouldn't), don't get dressed up for the occasion.  I tend to not think of price when dining out. It is secondary. However, the money you spend for a meal was not worth it at all and you'll leave dissatisfied. Our meal came to $200 for subpar quality and not a very enjoyable experience. We won't be back.",

    "text": "I consider it a local restaurant since it is in the red rock casino.  If you are local take the eastern side (valet) or park in the eastern side indoor parking and your right at the restaurant when you enter the casino. The restaurant looks amazing, fire, fire marble, beautiful tables, live music (singer, piano) classic and beautiful.  Full bar. The food is great.  It's a joy to go to this restaurant. Keep in mind it's not cheap.  A couple will leave a couple hundreds but worth it. When your done and want to stretch your legs you wanna go outside (a door next to the piano).  You will find an amazing lounge with pit fire, sofas, water fountain and pool view.  Truly a beautiful spot. My youngest fell into to the fountain, got wet from head to toe and I still recommend this place because it's good.  :-) by the way they sometimes have coupons online (Groupon etc...) Enjoy",

    "text": "I took my family there for what we thought would be a memorable Christmas meal.  It was but for the wrong reasons. My wife and I had recently been to the sister restaurant, Hank's at GVR, the experience was fantastic, which is why we chose T-Bones.  The service was very efficient, so much so we didn't get to finish the food on our plates, they were trying to bus them so soon.  However, overzealousness you can overlook but there was not personality or style, it was like a really good waitress at Denny's, except this meal was about to cost $300.  The food was the biggest disappointment.  My wife had an eclectic array and it was mostly very good, her crab cakes were just terrific, the Brussel Sprout salad, not so much.  The steaks should have been just wow, and both my sons and mine were luke-warm, with a hard crust on both.  He had the NY with Gorgonzola and I had the bone in rib eye.  Neither was anything above average and for what they charge you would think they should be spectacular.  We may or may not give them another try, but it was just so opposite of Hank's it really was a Christmas downer.",

She was knowledgeable of the menu & had excellent suggestions for the food & drinks. The crab cocktail was fresh and a high quality crab meat. The serving size was larger than expected for the price. I was expecting the lobster chowder to be like a fancy bisque. It was definitely a chowder filled with chunks of potato, corn and lobster meat. This was also very delicious. I will definitely return to try their entrees!",

High quality meats, good service, and a great mood with a big fireplace on the second level and lively bar with live music on the weekends. Excellent wine list, sommelier, Juan, is always helpful. Expect strip prices. Love the hearts of Palm salad before a steak...And the bread is dangerously delicious.",

Even though they took it off the menu a few years ago, if you requested it they would always bring it out.  Well the carpaccio has changed!! Not only was it not the best in the world, I would no longer recommend it.  It was salty, too many greens, and they no longer serve the delicious crustinis with it.  They have also removed my favorite blue cheese sauce from the menu.  And through all this, the extreme prices have stayed the same.",

We ordered our appetizer and waited for our server to take our order, he never came. We ate the appetizer and continued to wait... 22 minutes later he came to take our dinner order!! We received our food with no check back from our server, the bus boy bagged up our leftovers and we waited 15 mins until the server decided to ask about dessert! We said no, he sort of chuckled and walked away.  He presented our check by almost tossing it at me as he walked by. The food was decent but the whole experience was very upsetting not to mention we were seated in a booth in the bar, not on request but didnt mind so we were charged a 17% entertainment tax... So for $200 I would have expected better service since the server works for tips I would have expected more. It was horrible. The special birthday was kind of ruined.",

    "text": "Thanks to a Yelp Elite event my husband won a 100 dollar comp here, otherwise we probably could not afford to eat here without celebrating something.  We have been to a few Station Casino steakhouses and this one most certainly has that Station feel to it.  The menus are pretty much the same throughout the Stations family with slight variations in appetizers, sides and desserts.   We started off with the typical bread basket, and by far the pretzel bread was the best.  It didn't have that funky after taste to it like I had expected and I'm glad I gave it a shot.  It was the only appetizer that I had.  My husband on the other hand ate an entire plate of rock shrimp tempura.  It looked really good and I had to restrain myself from eating it and remind myself it was indeed seafood and seafood is poison.  By the way, if you are a seafood hater like me and are not craving a salad or soup you are pretty much SOL for appetizers here.    My hubby and I both had the filet mignon, shared a basket of sweet potato fries and the macaroni and cheese.  The mac and cheese was cute with little twister shaped pasta, but it tasted a little off.  The sweet potato fries were good and came in another twister shaped bucket with a fake newsprint wrap.  We ended with deep fried Oreos and a traditional banana split.  The Oreos were truly awful and the banana split was good, but big enough for two.  The best part was the vanilla ice cream.   Nothing stood out as spectacular, but it was a decent meal.  Service started off beautifully with introductions, recommendations, and explanations.  The staff was amazing, we got checked on by servers, bussers, management, I think the general manager even stopped by for a moment.  The table was swept up quickly and the first round of drinks were prompt.  My only complaint, can a girl get a refill?  The answer is apparently, no.  T-Bones is great, but for me the Charcoal Room at Santa Fe is still my favorite Station steakhouse.",

    "text": "T-Bones is a very nicely decorated, upscale  steakhouse located in the Red Rock Hotel/Casino.  It was my first time there, and it happened to be for a business dinner so not your usual dinner date night.  Instead, we had a prix fixe menu which included shrimp cocktail, heirloom tomatoes, Caesar salad,  petite filet mignon, and various dessert treats.  Overall, the service was just OK.  At these types of meetings, the servers don't want to interrupt too much, but a little more attentiveness to our drink levels would have been appreciated.    As for the food, my steak was a bit undercooked.   I ordered medium rare and it came out pretty red throughout the steak.  A few of my colleagues steaks were very rare and had to be sent back.  The appetizers and Caesar salad were good, but nothing to get overly excited about.  The side dishes included mashed potatoes and green beans.  While the green beans were perfectly cooked, the potatoes definitely need some work.  They were very runny and didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  The chef chose various desserts for us and nobody was complaining about these as they were devoured.  Although I dove right into one of the deep fried oreos (which was delicious btw), I couldn't help but question why we were eating a deep fried oreo at an upscale steakhouse that charges upwards of $50 for a steak.  Just me being snooty I guess.  Overall, the steak was good quality but the rest was just OK.  I'm sure you could find a better steakhouse in town for the money!",

    "text": "Food was amazing, service was top notch, and the decor gives it class. I really never thought a far off the strip steak house could win my heart but, I was so pleasantly surprised I did a mental double take.  First let me start with the decor. The restaurant has a very open design with high ceilings, red rock style accents, and huge fire pits.  The place also sports a patio which overlooks the pool area and seems like it would be a fun spot if it weren't so cold right now.  In fact now that I think of it the huge fire place/walls of fire almost give you a feeling of being in an oven so perhaps they are trying to make us hungry in advance.  So I ordered an appetizer from the seasonal menu, Foie Gras of course, the bone in prime rib, and the scalloped potatoes as a side. The portions are huge so you should count on sharing (the other people at the table ordered the Tuna Poke, Macaroni & Cheese, and the Brussel Sprouts). Before eating I had to try the cocktails, because really who needs a salad, and the menu was a fresh mix of interesting martinis. When the food came it was exactly as we ordered and looked great.    A side note to those of you that shudder at the thought of a \"bone-in\" steak. First the bone gives it flavor, second I am at the top of the food chain and I am happy about it so no I dont feel bad!  Back to the food, WOW! I kept saying it over and over during the meal \"I cant believe a place this well done and tastes this good exists off the strip\".  The leftovers made my day too. In summation I would highly recommend this spot for a nice dinner out if you want to stay off the strip. And yes go bone in...  *Full disclosure I was here for a food event*",

Heath whooped our butts at trivia but we won't hold that against him!  We had crab cocktail for starters and it was as good as it gets.  My husband had the bone-in filet and loved it.  I had the surf and turf and what can I say...I haven't had lobster tail that yummy in a long time.  The petite filet was (how we say in NY) like buttah!  We shared the mac-n-cheese and grilled asparagus as sides...both good but we took most of it home because we had to save room for dessert.  My husband had the toffee cake which he said was way too sweet.  I had the sorbet assortment and it was a great ending to a great meal.  The cappucinos were so-so; have had better elsewhere but this is a steak house so really, no complaints about that part.  The cocktails were very good also; my favorite was the Berrytini-yummy!  Overall, I highly recommend T-Bones Chophouse...nice environment, great staff, awesome food.  Like others, I agree it's pricey but the menu, including the prices, is posted at the hostess station so there's really no surprises there.  Lastly, to the reviewers who complained about this place not being \"kid-friendly\"...no offense but it's really not a \"family/kids\" place to begin with; however, we saw a couple of families w/ kids in tow last night and everyone seemed perfectly content.",

I like the crab appetizer, they give you four times more crab versus a similar appetizer at STK Steakhouse at the Cosmo.  They also have Niman Ranch all natural grass fed steaks and pork, far healthier and more flavorful/tender compared to unhealthy corn fed full of antibiotic and hormone conventional beef!

Atmosphere is dark and intimate, service is top notch, and food equal or preeminent of any steakhouse you'd find on the strip.  Good ordered: seafood tower, rotisserie chicken, bone-in filet, salmon, chopped salad and sides of sweet potatoes fries and asparagus.  Everything was delicious, and while we couldn't finish it all, we surely did our best trying.  There is a full bar, extensive wine list and a beautiful outdoor seating area.",

Despite having made a reservation, it took almost 20 mins to get seated as the table I was ultimately sat at remained vacant that whole time.

Steak was unremarkable for the excessive price.  Waiter took the blame for long wait to be seated but the problem lies with management.  Whether a local or a visitor, people deserve better than this type of service.",

Thursday- got there at 4 when they opened and sat at the bar ... wanted to order dinner, but we were told we had to wait until 5 to order dinner...not sure why,I would think if you open , you're ready... so we ordered cocktails and waited... staff was busy watching a repeat of a high school football game , St John Bosco vs Mater Dei as our drinks sat empty... finally after we asked them if we could order an appetizer they came over... Caesar salad bites were great... waited to order dinner at 5... simple Filet rare  and Eggplant Parmesan... dinner came to our table at 5:30! Ridiculous... but the food was delicious... paid our bill and checked after to see if we had our Red Rock players account credited... surprise, it wasn't ... had to go and stand in line at customer service to get them to add it...

    "text": "I have been to T-Bones before I started Yelping, and had very good experiences.  The steaks were on par w/ familiar high-end steakhouses like Mastros, and the ambiance & service matched as well.  T-Bones is in the Red Rock Resort in Summerlin.  Four of us started off w/ a small seafood tray ($75 | large shrimp, lump crab meat, oysters, half lobster & king crab) and a Jordan cab ($119).  First of all, the seafood tower was very good.  One of my co-workers doesn't eat much seafood, so the size was perfect.  The lobster tail was surprisingly large, as were the shrimp.  We barely finished it.  The only room for improvement would have been a different serving tray to showcase the seafood better, and some drawn butter:  4 Stars.  Likewise, the cab was excellent.  Jordan comes from the Alexander Valley in Napa and goes well w/ bold seafood and steaks:  5 Stars.  For our seconds, three of us ordered wedge salads ($12), while I had a caesar salad w/ anchovies ($12 - only the latter is pictured).  The wedge salads looked really good w/ blue cheese & bacon.  Unfortunately, the caesar was not as good bc it lacked flavor in the dressing, and the anchovies were not salty:  2 Stars.  For our mains, two ordered petite filets ($43), one ordered a 16 oz NY ($49), and I had a large filet ($48).  My steak was aged well, but could have benefited from more seasoning or butter.  Nonetheless, it was medium rare as requested and tender:  4 Stars.  For our sides, we ordered grilled asparagus ($12), cauliflower ($10), and mashed potatoes ($10 - sorry, no pics).  None of the sides really stood out, and the portions were small:  3 Stars.  Regarding the ambiance, its very fancy in here.  There is an awesome bar behind the hostess station when you enter.  In addition, there is a fire pit encased in glass in the center of the restaurant.  However, a big downside was a couple of large groups thought they owned the place, and were yelling and talking too loudly.  Most nice steakhouses have private rooms for this purpose:  2 Stars.  On the other hand, the service from Michael and his team were excellent.  They were super nice and attentive.  We didn't have to ask for anything additional:  5 Stars.  All in all, a very good experience.  However, T-Bones pales in comparison to Joe's Seafood in Caesar's Palace IMHO.  The latter executes on all fronts, has better tasting steaks, and does not have boorish customers.",

My daughter-in-law (Cindy) had to leave for work at 7:20pm. She paid entire bill with HUGE TIP for my bday At end of our meals the table was cleared to 95% and our leftovers were packed. We then had a couple trays of desserts in which we couldn't finish so dessert leftovers packed and I put those dessert trays on end of table w/other pieces for final cleanup. We received a message AFTER HOURS and told Cindy's meal \"was left behind and put aside for us to return for pickup.\"!  When four ADULTS left there was only small pile of organized dishes Not one of us (four) saw any meal or pkg on table other than our huge bag and two loose containers. Though these establishments sometimes \"COMP\" meals....apparently after discussing w/MANAGER the situation,  we were NOT WORTHY of getting an answer back nor the refund of Halibut/Spinach dinner Cindy was looking forward to after her shift over. I literally gave Cindy's number to manager for contact on this dinner to be taken off bill. We are middle class who enjoy the occasional perks of a great establishment BUT AFTER THIS LACK OF CONCERN FOR US....WE WILL NEVER STEP INTO TBONES EVER AGAIN. There are several great places around Vegas to enjoy. My son/girl work the nightlife....very good tippers.",

It could be a meal in itself. I took half home for later. The complementary bread basket has delicious options. I had the petite fillet and creamed corn for my meal.

And to my surprise, he came out and we had a great conversation. Nice guy and he made sure to tell me that it was a team effort in the kitchen. So why the 4 out of 5 stars, sorry, but had to ding them on the way I was seated.

Our table was next to a serving area for the waiters where glasses and silverware were clanging continuously, much like Denny's, and apparently this is where the waiters congregate to talk about the customers. One was overheard saying... (Referring to one of the other customers), \"...that <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FM.F.er&s=77c67ebc194e08751881e0f5b23857da9806043d4c52dee41db3c98601e622d6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">M.F.er</a>...\" I did not want to make an issue of it at the time... so I said nothing, but I do not think this should have been a discussion that had to be overheard by other customers, and in particular... my daughter.  We did not order alcohol and instead ordered a bottle of water, while my daughter had a coke. The waiters kept filling the water glasses, despite the fact the glasses were full and then opened a second bottle of water quite quickly. The second bottle, which was left on the table, was over half full. Each bottle was $7.00.  We arrived at about 6:30 and after ordering, the food took a very very long time to arrive...too long, but the food was excellent.  To make conversation I asked one of the waiters who they cater to the most? He said locals... 'They see the same people repeatedly and know them by name'. I found this hard to believe, but I bet they do not get seated at the table by the serving area. That table should be eliminated altogether due to the above and because everyone who passes by has to turn sideways to squeeze between this table and the next.  There is a beautiful gas fireplace that is impressive upon entering, but the noise from the serving area and talking obliterates the expectations of this first impression. It is too loud; to hear the person on the other side of the table you have to practically yell.  It feels like you have not left the gambling area at all. To top it off, immediately outside the restaurant are the penny slots. Just seems disappointing after spending $200 on a dinner for three (just for 3 entrees).  Also, an employee who probably just finished with her shift, came from the back room carrying a clear bag of trash in one hand while still wearing a blue latex glove on the other hand and walked thru the restaurant...just seemed strange in such an apparently nice restaurant.  The food was good. The service was not bad, but the waiters should realize their complaints about customers should not be discussed on the floor. It seems more likely that this place caters to the high rollers whose meals are being comped.",

    "text": "My mom and I had dinner here recently.  Overall the food was good and the server was decent but the hostesses could not have been anymore snooty.  I had this issue the last time I was there.  When did hostess' decide to be so snooty.  They are there to serve the customer, not be rude to them.  We had a reservation but ended up waiting for around 15 minutes to be seated.  A couple who came in after us got seated before us and I complained.  One of the hostesses said they had an earlier reservation and just stepped away for a drink.  Ummm... I don't think so since you can get a drink inside the place.  Once we were seated, everything was pretty good.  For starters, mom had the Traditional French Onion Soup - Sweet Texas Onions, Swiss, Gruyere, Parmigiano Reggiano.  I had the Brussels Sprouts salad - Mache, Manchego Cheese, Speck, Hazelnuts, Sherry Vinaigrette.  We both enjoyed our starters.  The salad was good size and filled me up quite a bit.  For entrees, I had the 8 oz Petite Filet Mignon.  Mom had the Colorado Lamb Chops - Herb Marinated, Bordelaise.  Both were good.  The steak was nicely cooked to my liking.  A little pick inside but not too much.   For sides, we had the Mushrooms - Crimini, Maitake, Royal Trumpets, Enoki, Bourbon; Tater Tots - Russet Potatoes, House Made Dill Ketchup; and Creamed Corn - Sweet White Corn, Parmesan Crumbs.  The tots were a little too soft and not like tots should be.  They were tasty though.  There was so much food, we had leftovers which I warmed up the next day.  Everything was still tasty.    Now if they can just get rid of the snooty hostesses.",

The entire time I was there (a Saturday night), there was a live singer and she was HORRIBLE. Her pitchy-off key singing ruined the general ambiance. I couldn't wait to get out of there and escape hearing her ruin song after song. I also had the WORST filet I've ever had. I was not cooked as I had requested (medium rare) and had absolutely NO flavor.",

    "text": "This used to be our favorite place to have date night. Not so much anymore. We had a 7:15pm reservation Tuesday night. As my husband and I arrived we were seated around 7:30. Not only was this the beginning of the WORST SERVICE but definitely a waste of money and our time. My husband ordered a pricey bourbon neat with a perfect ice cube. Every time we go this is his drink of choice. They prepare it in front of the table as  the presentation is part of the allure. This time it was dropped off already made. Understanding maybe they were busy we didn't think much of it.. until we then still didn't have even water and had to wait an additional 10 minutes to receive that. Then after our server frantically greeted us we didn't see her again for about 30 mins. We ordered our salads through the busser that didn't speak much English. Then the servers assistant came over and ask if we would like to start with an appetizer??? First time we saw her as well. So 40 mins into be seated (With reservations!!) we finally received bread. About 15 minutes after that our salads were dropped off by a manager .... still have not seen anyone or been asked about our entrees. Our plates AND beverages sat in front of us EMPTY for at least 10 mins before anyone cleared them or offered even water.  We both were trying to ignore the fact that the service was so bad and unorganized as we just really wanted to enjoy dinner and time together. But then our steaks, BOTH filets ordered Med-rare cam out 40 MINS LATER!!!!!!! Also dropped off by another person we never saw before and a different manager. My husbands was almost prepared at medwell and mine was cold!!! We were so hungry at this point... and no one came to check on our meals or us so we just wanted to leave. The server finally approached our table saying she was sorry it took so long and scurried off. The busser then came by to take our almost full plates of food when I had asked to wrap it up. He ran to the back came back out with three boxes and a bag and dropped them off on our table. We felt extremely ignored and not only was this the worst service I have ever received at a steak house, but even more so because of the lack of courtesy.  Im even more disappointed that the management didn't address the situation as a two person dinner took over 21/2 hours to complete and with total un satisfaction.  You guys really slacked in every department and we are very easy to please.",

    "text": "The reason why i give Tbones 3 stars would start with how we were seated in the back /plain room not in the main beautifully decorated dining area. My husband goes to order the most expensive steak on the menu and it is not available. And then the Walk Around Bread Boy? Kind of weird that you spend high price and they cant even give u a sample basket of each bread he is offering. You have to choose one!! The final straw was the waiter . He would speak to you normally but to his staff he acted like kermit the frog.   The food ended up being decent 7/10 . Lobster was not as juicy or large as i would have expected for $72. The 22 oz ribeye was not bad seasoned as a prime rib. I could not tell the difference between that and a prime rib cut. Mac and cheese was very tasteful although presented as a small bowl of big noodles. The bone marrow was good but was very small . The waiter made it seem like the bone marrow was going to be a normal size portion. But they brought out a quarter of a normal portion.   Overall i may not come back here and we frequently return to restaurants when we are satisfied with food and service to price ratio.",

The vegetables are Your basic veggies ours were undercooked and the steak and lobster was just that steak and lobster. Cooked well but lacked any real flavor profile. The lobster was a bit over cooked so it was a bit tough and rubbery. We really weren't impressed with anything, there was no identity or depth to the food. The price is pretty average for a Las Vegas steakhouse.",

I had a reservation on July 4th at 8:15 pm for the patio.  When I checked in at 8:10 and asked about my patio request she said she would seat us close to our reservation time and \"ok\" for the patio. The lobby started to fill up.  literally every party was sat and it was now 8:27 and we were still waiting.  I assumed the reason was waiting for opening on the patio. I finally approached the desk asking what was our status. She said \"oh, I can seat you at a back booth now\". I told her my patio request and that she sat 2 other tables that came in after us.  She said \"no  patio available and one of the other hostesses didn't put in the order of arrival for patrons\". When we finally sat at a booth by the bar, our waiter Joseph (he was great) came over and said \"they finally sat you? you were the last one's left in the lobby. I saw that you've been waiting\". When we complained to him about the hostess situation and the 2nd time it has happened, he said that he has heard that from  a few patrons.  It's unfortunate that good patrons are treated poorly before a wonderful dinner.",

    "text": "Family member treated me to birthday dinner here.   Absolutely, hands down the best service I have experienced in a hotel restaurant / steak house.  Everything was \"attention\" to details.    Menu has lots of options and there are plenty of steak and non-steak choices.   The starters and sides are shareable -- entrees are individual portions.  The bread basket --- yeah --- I'll have 4 -5 of those Belgian pretzels to go please.  And the sweet dark bread -- two loafs please.  OMG good and fresh !!!!  Our glasses were never empty.      The wine list is very comprehensive --- and even though I did wine by glass (only wine drinker in group) --- their by the glass and bottle selection was very tempting.  We skipped salad but shared a couple of sides (grilled tomatoes --- were super !!!) .    We had steak (grass fed ones) and scallops --- the sauces were perfection !!!  I got a special birthday desert -- creme brulee and dipped strawberry --- yep, melt me down....(if you read my other food reviews -- I have a thing for creme brulee :-) )  We also got cheese cake for the rest of the table.   And later --- some hand made chocolates showed up ---- perfect ending.  Coffee was very good and fresh.   Our waiter/waitress team --- was ROCK STAR awesome !!! And thank you for making a special night --- even better !!!  At the end, the manager (Jennifer?) came by and checked on us --- and wished me happy birthday.   So attentive and on par with what type of service we expected at a good steakhouse.  Everyone was so on top of their game --- and the restaurant was elegant but not stuffy.  There is booth, table and outdoor seating.    There is a nice bar area in front --- enjoyed the views of Red Rock canyon imagery (as we had just been hiking there in the am).    I felt comfortably dressed in pant suit -- but there were jeans and long skirts / dresses as well.   Pretty easy going dress code.  For two entrees, two sides, two desserts, wine x 2 glasses, coffee x 1 --- 160.00   As Arnold says... We'll be back.",

    "text": "After the spa we decided we needed to stuff our faces. Steak it is! TBones is right around the corner from the spa so we decided to dine here. We asked for a table for two and waited ten min or so and then were sat. Our server took awhile to get over to us but in the meantime we got water poured, a wine list delivered and bread. Our server finally made it over and we ordered: two Lobster Chowders, Cheateaubriand for two and a side of Hashbrowns. The Lobster Chowder came out and it was decent... Just two lumps of meat sitting on top of the soup, corn and potatoes swimming in the soup as well. I guess I always expect a big ass amount of meat when I order stuff like this but then Im always let down since it only appears to be a SMALL amount of meat. Anyway we drank our Moscato D'Asti which was MMMMM GOOOOD!! And waited for our dinner. And waited. And waited. It seemed like it took FOREVER. It finally arrived! They carve it table side since it is meant for two. They cut that bad boy open and BOOM! RARE! We ordered it Medium Rare. Some places undercook though.. Half of it was perfect for Mandi L. but I chose to have them cook mine a little longer. I still wanted Medium Rare - but about five minutes later when it came back out, it was cooked nearly Medium WELL! A couple parts might have passed for Medium and Medium Rare but it was definitely overcooked. They asked how it was then and I chose not to send it back. My food would have taken forever and since it was a cut meant for two would they have cooked a whole new one or what??! Anyway it was fine. The vegetables that accompanied the entree were broccoli, asparagus, potatoes, carrots and those little onions. The hashbrowns are served with a sunny side up egg!  The meal was GOOD but not mind blowing and could have definitely been A LOT BETTER. Our server and the food timing was slow but all the staff was very nice.  We were also seated right by the fireplace. It's really nice but it is HOT. Once we got our food we did ask if they could turn the fire place off or down and they said they couldnt. They asked if we would like to move tables but by that point we were almost done with dinner so we just decided to stay and sweat it out.",

The service is fantastic, the setting and decor devine...but the food just doesn't stack up against better known steakhouses, and with virtually the same price point.  The location inside the Red Rock Hotel makes it an easy-peasy, no hassle, off-strip choice...might be the only reason to choose it (especially, if your staying at the hotel, or if convenient to Summerlin residents).  For me, having an appetizer or a drink at the inside bar, or better yet -- the beautiful outdoor bar with a firepit, large sofas and chairs -- is absolutely terrific.  For the main course, I'd take my business elsewhere.  A tip for parking is to valet park on the backside, the hotel entrance, with just a short walk thru the hotel lobby and either up the stairs (passing the outstanding chandelier), or 1 floor up in the elevator...takes you right to the T-Bones entrance.",

    "text": "Had a great steak here, and the portions of the sides and salads were huge.  The prices were steep, not getting a break for being off the strip, 24oz bone in dry aged prime ribeye for 52 bucks, expected I guess.  They marinate this steak in a cilantro garlic sauce and I usually don't like good steaks marinated but it was awesome and was perfectly mild compared to the beef flavor.  It was thick and cooked perfect, juicy, extra tender, and seasoned perfect.  My girlfriend got the waygu (american kobe) skirts steak and we loved it, maybe more than my ribeye, strong delicious beef flavor and super tender for 39, a little small portion size but perfect for her.  The sides (mac and cheese, chopped salad, lobster bisque) where all real good and real rich, maybe too rich, maybe? Even the chopped salad felt real unhealthy but was delicious.  The bread selection was awesome and served hot, so overall the food was great.  The bad was our service was below average, kind of bad even and the corkage fee was 35 bucks, ouch.  We did sit outside and it was real nice out there, perhaps thats why our server was hard to find as there were only a few parties dining al fresco but I wouldn't be the first to say that they had bad service, i would still go back.",

The sides are giant as everyone attests to, and the bread basket has a nice assortment.  I tried the steakhouse salad but it was chopped too much for my taste, my bad, not really an indictment of the salad.  This is the top end of the price scale for a vegas trip.  Sides we tried were mac n' cheese (I can't avoid this), the white corn (seasonal) and some garlic mashed.  All good.  Three glasses of wine all round, so dinner for 3 including tax and the Godzilla (NOT including tip) was $300.  Plan accordingly.  Nice service and a good place for a special occasion.

The blue cotton candy melts into a glass of awesomeness.  Everybody at our table loved everything we ordered.  The service was also very helpful and put up with all our questions.

Appetizers were all awesome, TONS of side item choices (all of which were great), and entrees were incredible.  And our wine selection - a dry Australian cabernet around $130 - was perfect.   We had 2-3 very attentive waiters, and the sommelier also helped with the wine selection.  I'm not sure if we were the exception to the rule, or if the other yelpers happened to go on off nights, but our service was fantastic. Downsides would be - the prime rib was ridicously large (think John Candy in The Great Outdoors trying to eat that whole steak); and of course it's not cheap.  But if you're looking to splurge at a steakhouse, I'd recommend this, right in line with Strip Steak and craftsteak. Oh, and if you have a special occasion (which they asked when I placed the reservation), let them know - since it was my birthday, they delivered a free slice of some of the best cheesecake I've ever had!!",

Food on happy hour menu is very generous in size and pretty tasty.  $5 for a large burger is a pretty good deal!

Unfortunately, my LAST experience there matched my second and I really took notice this time of how frazzled the service staff was as a result of the kitchen's poor coordination.    As my wife and I sat at the bar for over a half hour later than our original reservation time, we engaged in conversation with others dining at the bar; I've never seen so many people send back cold food.

I must admit that when I saw the bread basket full of rustic breads, I started to sweat.  Then when Jan started showing me the olives in the bread and moaning how wonderful it was, I grabbed a small piece, slathered it in butter and scarfed it down.  Damn was that good.  Then Susan and Jeric kept carrying on about the raisin nut bread and again I cheated and had a small piece.  It was the best bread I ever had.    The waiter here was great and we ordered a bunch of menu items to share amongst the four of us and the waiter was very accommodating.  The Rib-eye with cilantro sauce was great.  Jeric even liked the sauce and he generally refers to cilantro as the \"devil weed\".  The short ribs over mashed taters were also very good, as were the salads that we ordered and the asparagus with holandaise sauce.  A great place to eat!",

The tomatoes with spinach and cheese were not as good as I'd hoped ... heavy and, again, lacking in freshness.  My entree, the Dover Sole, was mediocre.  Not terrible, but not nearly as flavorful as I was hoping it would be, especially for the price. I almost never eat beef, but someone else in my party had the rib-eye steak, so I tried a bite and I have to say ... it was pretty incredible.  The portion sizes were ridiculously large.  Each entree could have easily been split among three people, they were such huge chunks of meat.  For dessert, our party of six split the brownie sundae and the deep-fried oreos.  The oreos were nothing like what I expected ... they tasted quite good, but I could only take one bite before feeling overwhelmed.  The sundae was nothing special.  It was a pleasant dining experience, and felt nice to indulge, but I was disappointed in many of the dishes we had.",

Sides are all $10 and $12 and we shared mac & cheese and mashed potatoes.  Menu is pricy; our queen's cut of prime rib was $38 - cheaper than lowest priced steak at $42.  Food just amazing. They now have a scotch cart with gadget that makes a round ball of ice for your cocktail - it was a nice presentation and nice touch.  Overall great meal.",

Waited 1 hour in line with No end in sight  so we left,  along with  A lot of people, the rest of the people in line were complaining especially the locals.  They only had 2 cashiers and 1 hostess seating. No manager was on duty.  Went to T- Bones instead.  Great atmosphere, but over priced for the amount of food and off the strip location. Dinner for 3 with 2 glasses of wine, 2 mains, No desert was $ 190.00 plus tip. Should consider having a rate for locals.  Will go to the Red Rock Casino buffet tonight for the Easter Buffet.

Her filet was melt in your mouth fantastic.  My veal had a slight mesquite char to the outside but equally good.  We had the   Caesar and the dressing had a nice twist.  The price point is on the high side for off-strip and downtown premium steak restaurants.  But the service and atmosphere was great.  The RR is a great destination for a night out or a weekend stay and make T-Bones part of your plans.",

    "text": "OK; just a short review.  Some friends of mine have encouraged me to write this review and add it to the yelp postings.  I ate here twice last year, as a guest of the management of the casino.  Both times were great.  I ate steak (obviously) both times; once the $52 bone-in rib steak and the other time the $56 lamb chops.  Very delicious, as was the sides.  This establishment is very nice and the food and booze and wines are great, but pretty expensive.  Well, not ungodly expensive, but pretty darn expensive if you ask me.  My scotch costs like $25 a shot, and my wine was like $350 for the bottle (retail price is $149).  So in conclusion, if you want a very nice place and a very good meal, you won't be disappointed by going here, but just remember that it is a pretty pricey place.",

Then the waiter came over we weren't quite ready, so we asked for a few more minutes, which turned into waiting for 10 minutes more. Finally, we asked the busboy to please send over our waiter.  The waiter finally came over & seemed very flustered.  We ordered the grass fed filet & the regular petite filet, med. rare. The grass fed filet was phenomenal, perfectly cooked. The regular filet came out raw.... disgusting. The waiter was attentive for the first 3 minutes of our meal getting to us & then vanished again. I hate to send anything back, but, this was inedible. It came back 3 minutes later & appeared to be good, until I cut another piece that was completely raw.  At this point we were so over this place, the service, the food, we got the check & left. I felt sad for the waiter, he obvious didn't cook the food, but come on, check on your tables.  No manager came to apologize or even ask us how everything else was.  The restaurant is very pretty, there was a fantastic singer playing the piano and the ambiance was out of this world.",

As we went for an early dinner on a weeknight, it was not crowded and we were able to get a table right away without a wait. The service was very attentive and nice, but our server didn't seem to be very knowledgable about menu or drink offerings.   We started off with the beef carpaccio and the seafood tower. I was impressed with the seafood tower- it was amazing! Lump crab, jumbo shrimp, stone crab, lobster, and oysters.  All of my favorite things!! The accompanying sauces were also good, but my friend did not realize that one was fresh horseradish and took a HUGE scoop of it on his shrimp... OMG, that was a bad situation!! Luckily, it didn't spoil our meal.  We ordered the 22 oz ribeye, which they sliced at the table so we could share it. We ordered it medium-rare, and it definitely was undercooked- more rare than med-rare. It also was VERY fatty. I know that ribeye is a fattier cut, and that's what I usually like about it, but this was pretty over the top. They did re-cook it for a bit for us, but the damage was pretty much already done.   The mushrooms we ordered on the side were delicious, though.  The other highlight of my meal was dessert- the cheesecake was FAN-TAS-TIC!! One of the best cheesecakes I've had in quite some time. Light, fluffy, moist, melt in your mouth... It definitely made the meal end on a high note.  Price-- Expensive. Surprisingly, the meal was just as expensive as a celeb chef steakhouse on the Strip. Not quite what I expected, but that is par for the course, I suppose.  I've gone back and forth between a 3 and 4 star review, and finally settled on 3 stars.. I had a fine experience, but not fine enough to say that I'm a fan.",

Service was not good, food wasn't bad, best part was probably the bread that we HAD to ask for unlike others sitting around us. Maybe because we were dressed casual and not like the out of town business men, we were given less attention. We've dined in steakhouses all over the US and are regulars at a few of our favorites. We expect great service at the least for what we spend at places like these.",

My husband and I came here on a Saturday with last minute reservations for 6:30PM and were pleasantly surprised that we got in.  The place was not that busy, but there was a party bring hosted at the end of the bar with live entertainment.  As soon as we sat down we were greeted by our super professional, friendly and knowledgeable waiter who made a few food suggestions.  After a few short minutes my husband and I knew what we wanted. I opted for their 8oz filet mignon and kale walnut salad and my husband ordered a strip steak and sauteed mushrooms.  The food came out faster than what we expected and it all tasted delicious. It was all cooked the way we had asked and the service was great.   My filet was cooked almost well and was one of the most tender pieces of mignon I've ever had and my husbands steak was done medium rare and he enjoyed it very much.   To finish our meal my husband and I decided to order some desert and coffee and let me tell you that we were not disappointed! The coffee tasted amazing! It was very fresh and bold yet smooth and and our trio of ice creams tasted out of this world delicious.   Our whole evening was very pleasant and I would definitely come here again. The only thing that prevents me from giving T Bones 5 stars is that the echo from the live entertainment was so loud that it was hard to carry on a conversation.   Other than that it was a very enjoyable tastetastic evening!   2 thumbs way up for T Bones!!!!",

This meant squeezing in and adding a few chairs. The servers were awesome putting up with us and not refusing our request.  There were too many things ordered to list them all, but the steaks are phenomenal and the Kale Salad is to die for. If you're ever there, then definitely try the Kale Salad. Everyone was pleased with their meal and the wine selection is superb. A little on the pricey side, but well worth it!",

Seafood platter was super good-- size and price depends on number of ppl you order it for. We ordered for 6 people and the platter had oysters, lobster, king crab, etc. Super good! I recommend it if you like seafood :D  We tried a whole bunch of steak and lobster and all were FANTASTIC! i like my steak rare and they cooked it perfectly.  Wanted to try their kobe but it was like $30 per ounce and 4 ounce was minimum order so never mind that xD but i do want to go again some time and try their other dishes! :)",

    "text": "This should be a 6 stars, but.  Let's address the bad part first.  I made reservations for my wife's birthday at 5pm.  We arrived about ten minutes early.  We walked in and I told the hostess my name and we had reservations but we were early, could we please be seated early.  She said, we don't seat anybody before 5pm, and turned her back and continued talking to two other young ladies.   No offer to sit in the bar, no offer of anything.  Just left me standing there.  So we walked out and stood for ten minutes and walked back in.  Once again the hostess never said hi, welcome, nothing, but a look on her face like she was doing me a favor.  She asked my name, I just told her ten minutes earlier, I never left her sight, but I'll play the game.  Told her my name and time of my reservation.  She looked at the computer screen and walked away towards the resturant,  I looked at my wife and laughed, I guess we should follow.  No , let me seat you, or this way please, not a word from her.  Remember we are there on a week day, at 5pm.  We are the first ones in the resturant,  nobody is seated yet, and she seats us at a table directly in front of the kitchen door.  Now I am looking for a hidden camera, this must be a joke.  I stopped this young lady and asked for another table.  She seated us at a booth,  and everything from then on was fantastic.  The food we ordered was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, we had one of the best server we have ever had, Troy.  He made some great suggestions and all were as good as he promised.   His wine suggestion was on point.  My wife'sbirthday was great, thank You! When we left, the same hostess was at the desk, no thank you, no hope you enjoyed yourself,  no please come back , not a word, same look on her face like she was something special.  If you can get past the rude hostess, who needs a personality and some professionalism , it's a fantastic resturant.",

Nice wine list and delicious specialty cocktails- ( the Tequila cocktail was amazing). Started with the lump crab cocktail and crab cakes- both were excellent- highly recommend either. Then split the steak house salad and  11 oz filet with my mother in law, which was cooked perfectly!  My husband had Dover Sole - he orders it every time we come here and it is always great! The nice thing was that the kitchen split everything for us - it was a perfect dinner! Food here is always consistent and very, very, good but our service was impeccable! Thanks Junior!",

The large fireplace to the left of the restaurant was gorgeous and a large set of dice that appeared above it reminded you you were still in Vegas. It was a Tuesday and I was celebrating my birthday with three of my girlfriends. We sat in a beautiful booth ordered some custom crafted beverages from the menu and allowed our server to almost run the show on our appetizers, salad and complementing wine. The crab cakes were The Best!  I've tried crab cakes Everywhere and these were definitely the best I've had. The Campari tomatoes had me wanting more but I new I needed to save room for the main course. I had the main lobster and my girlfriend and I split a filet. Both were exquisite. For the finale our wonderful server (I believe it was Mike) brought a plethora of different desserts plus a low key birthday jingle. All I can say is OMG the Fried Ores were to die for. Any I wanted to share my experience with the world and make sure people check out this hidden gem off the strip.",

We were on the bar side and it was a little loud. I ordered the five onion soup ($14) as usual, and my wife had the chopped steak house salad ($12).  The soup was good, beefy and plenty of onions. I could have used more cheese though, was a little spartan in the cheese department. The chopped salad was as advertised, chopped to tiny bits. It had a \"white French\" dressing, which was new to me but was good. For entrees I had the wet aged rib eye ($64)  and my wife had the grass fed filet ($49). My steak was good but a little dry. It was weird cause it was cooked perfectly on the inside, medium, but was crispy on the outside. Like they blasted it with high heat first them slow cooked it or something. I'm not familiar with wet aged, only had dry aged in the past so maybe it's how it was supposed to be. I enjoyed it, just found it a little dry. My wife's filet was excellent. Cooked perfectly and very tender. For sides we had the potatoes gratin ($11) and mushrooms. ($13)  Potatoes were awesome and we devoured them. Mushrooms were also good. It was an assortment of mushrooms and they were very tasty. Service was good and friendly.",

Our cocktails were shaken up just right. We sat at the bar and enjoyed chatting with the bartender. Then off to our table we went. We ordered a steak and seafood that were equally amazing. We shared so we both were able to enjoy a variety in our meals.  I love this area in general because it does not have that cheesy Las Vegas over the top feeling. The restaurant is near a shopping mall and attached to a casino but does not feel like a place you only go after a day of buying beautiful things or killing it at the Blackjack table. I will definitely return on my next visit to see friends.",

In the middle of a nice steak dinner on Sunday night, my companions were talking about the flavorful, cilantro-garlic sauce for the bone in rib eye at T-Bones Chophouse.  Yes, we were eating steak at one restaurant and talking about the steak at another establishment.  So, what'd we do for dinner Monday?  We headed to Red Rock Hotel/Casino for dinner at T-Bones.  You'd think we'd be steak-ed out, but NO, not us.  I love cilantro, so I was looking forward to trying this steak & sauce they were all raving about.    Our local friend actually had enough steak, so he opted for the halibut, but my other friend got the bone in rib eye 35 day dry aged Niman Ranch rib eye.  Oh, no doubt about it, I was getting that puppy too.  Did I mention I also got mine topped with some seared foie gras?  Thank you, Nevada (in case you aren't from California, or haven't followed the food news, the foie gras ban started July 1)!  Our table shared some steamed asparagus and charred summer corn.  Okay, back to that steak.  It was excellent!  My steak had a perfect char on every bit of that wonderfully marbled hunk of meat.  And that sauce?!  SHUT UP! I wanted to pick up that little copper pot of sauce and drink it right there on the spot.  Sure, people were dressed to the nines in their sexy Vegas wear, but I know how to eat a bone in steak.  Yes, I picked up that bone and gave it a good chew.  My friends said I did it in a feminine way.  I'm not so sure how you gnaw on a bone with a femininely, but oh man that was good.    Go.  Finish reading this, then make your reservation.  Go to T-Bones Chophouse and order your very own bone in rib eye.  Trust me.  Go.",

If there was a misstep, it was the communication between server, busser, lead. They seemed as if they were each on their own agenda, a bit out of sync with each other. A table touch of \"how is everything\" happened 3 times within 2 minutes. But the food is great! Many sides to chose from for the ala carte steaks. Loved the hearts of palm salad, the elote corn side, the ribeye steak with peppercorn sauce. The chef is doing a great job here for sure.",

Let me preface by saying we are not burger connoisseurs by any means and generally don't go to nice restaurants to eat a burger. I'm sure there are plenty great ones in this city but man dat burger... best burger I've ever tried. Ground ribe-eye steak and perfect char even a 10 year old can appreciate.   Tbones has a classy atmosphere and the crowd is fitting but IMHO the price point is a little high. For the price of an app, entree and a la carte sides, I'd rather take the trip to the Strip and enjoy a nice evening out.

We were there sat night with a party of 10.  I made a reservation.  We arrived 10 min before the reservation.  At 7pm our reservation time i asked the hostess if we could sit down and was told our table would be ready soon it needed to be set.  After asking 2 more times if we could sit down we finally got to our table at 7:25.  I'm not sure why it took them 25 min to set the table because it was empty the whole time.  Once our party sat , we were all there at the same time it took us 20 min. before a waiter came by our table to take a drink order, he only  stopped because we flagged him down.  We dint have our food order taken for another 30 min.  Now we had our waiter come by the table once or twice after we flagged him down so i could order a drink and instead of asking the rest of the 9 people if they needed something he sped off.  This was bad enough but he also had a bad attitude as if he was mad he had to wait on a table of 10.  Unknown to him 2 of our guests work in the restaurant business locally for Michael Mina.  Needless to say they were not very happy.  My wife told the waiter when we first sat down that she was interested in a prime rib med rare, and he replied well yes that is a very popular item.  Our numerous previous visits the waiter would stop taking orders and go check to make sure there was still one left and then reserve it for us, he did not. His attitude didn't get any better.  He took our different orders for drinks or other items thoughout the meal and never bothered to ask the other guests if they needed anything.  We had to keep fagging him down for drinks coffee etc.  At the ned of the meal I asked hime if the fire pit was on on the patio and his reponse was that it was cool out side so probably yes it was on, even more attitude right down to the last min of our stay.  Our bill was $1300.00 with out the tip.  We did tip him probably more then we should have but not 20%.  We still can't get over the terrible service and bad attitude now the last 2 times we have eaten there.  Even funnier thing I tried to call the manager Sun and Mon at 5pm and couldn't get through to him.  I waited on hold for at least 10min both times and the hostess said he wasn't available.  The food is still good but for the money the service has to get a lot better.",

A budget you'd expect to have when  you visit an expensive restaurant. Steakhouse salad is a great starter. The Lobster chowder was luscious.  Steaks were truly prime and aged perfectly. Prepared exactly the way they were ordered. Staff was very attentive and not annoying. We were not rushed through the meal.  Had zero room left for dessert but the selection was rich. Many diners stayed to chat after they finished their meals and paid the check. Staff was very accommodating and even returned to fill water glasses again and offer more coffee to those who were hanging out. Earned the 4 stars.",

There should be no need for anyone at the table to ask for another drink, not for these prices.  Three people assigned to our table.  Prior service experiences have been better.  The food is awesome. No complaints. The sea bass, filets, crab cakes, and scallops were all excellent.  Upon leaving we realized that we did not give the waiter our players club card.  We returned with 10 minutes to get our credit.  Without our receipt and since the bill was \"closed out\" they said \"can't help you\".  Wrong answer. Upon further conversation they still refused to make this right.  They must be the only steak house in town. Lame.  Lost a customer over not doing the right thing.  May I recommend Flemings, Andiron in DT Summerlin, or Echo & Rigs in Tivoli for a more pleasant experience.  Staffs are accommodating and actually more than willing to do the right thing.  I guess $500 gets you average service and a far from a helpful staff/management at T-Bones.  Merry Christmas!",

I was dining with 5 other friends from work who had a much different experience than I did and I was deputized by the group to review the restaurant with our collective opinions rather than mine alone as all of my other reviews are.  Let me say up front if it were me alone I would awarding somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.  I thought the food and service was above average and I found the restaurant to be comfortable and the noise level to be at an intensity that contributed to a lively atmosphere but did not inhibit conversation.    My trusty companions felt the food was average.  Most ordered the petite filet mignon (huge mistake in a chophouse if you ask me) and I along with another coworker had the bone-in rib eye (the steak of all steaks the only cut of beef I eat unless it's prime rib).  As sides we ordered Tater Tots, Grilled Tomato's, Mac & Cheese and Hash Browns (see pictures).  T-Bones brags that their prime steaks are wet aged 20 days and then dry aged another 15 days.  I personally found my rib eye to be very good how companions found their steaks to be lacking flavor and the texture unappealing.  I have to agree the sides needed help and in my opinion were the biggest disappointment of the evening.  I had read up on the menu before arriving and was very excited by the hash browns with a sunny side up egg (how could you resist).  Unfortunately, they do not taste as good as they look.  They were definitely lacking flavor unless you count the prestigious amount of salt they must season them with.   For a party of six you need two eggs instead of one.   Skip the grilled tomatoes.  Big mistake!  They're topped with American cheese (OMG).  Don't bother with this side dish (besides why would you order fruit at a chophouse).  Tater tots are \"eh!\"  Very small portion and again over seasoned with salt.  The mac & cheese was another small portion and as my friend put it \"they were topped with Kraft Bacon Bits straight from the supermarket.\"  I don't know about that but they were not memorable and now days when everyone is doing gourmet Mac & Cheese it better be good and it better be special.  These were not.   Needless to say as a group we were disappointed and we left without having desert because of it.   My friend summed it up by stating, \"This is the first time I've ever been disappointed in a meal while in Las Vegas.  After a moment of considering this statement I had to agree.  I would not visit T-Bones again which is a very disappointing statement to make for many reasons not the least of which was I thought that I had enjoyed it more until I evaluated my experience by that statement.  Would I spend $500 for a meal like this again?  The answer is no I wouldn't and there are many other places in Las Vegas I were I would.",

My only disappointment about T-Bones is that they no longer have happy hour on Friday, we used to love to come here to enjoy a few drinks before enjoying our meal.... we now come less often due to this change.",

Service started out good but toward the end I think my waiter either left for the day or went to break as the whole check process was about 20-25 minutes. I mean the food is good but not stellar. I have had better meals for less. Drinks are a little over priced, especially for being off the strip. Wagyu was good but again not great. They don't have you cut into the steak when they bring it out to make sure it's done correctly, which they were but still. $220 for two of us.",

    "text": "I write this review as I sit here in a food induced coma... So. Full. So. Good. Our server, Billy, was excellent. He made wonderful wine pairing suggestions to go with our steaks. At first I thought my wine was terrible... Before our steaks arrived. But, once I had a bite and a sip- I completely changed my mind! They were perfect together. I highly recommend the wedge salad with the peppercorn ranch. For sides we had the macaroni and cheese (delicious), a chipotle style corn (I don't recall the name, but it was tasty), and green beans (very good). My only regret is that I should've ordered my steak medium rare instead of medium! Shame on me!!! By the time desserts rolled around, we were stuffed, but still went for the cheesecake and a deep fried Oreo. Both excellent! Side note- if you like your espresso with lemon, make sure you ask for it as they only provide it upon request. Overall, we will be back! The ambiance, service, and food make for a perfect night out with your significant other or family.",

It was not the food, it was not the service, it was specifically every single hostess that was in the place tonight. There is a level of hotness that I could not ever believe could be attained, this places surpassed it by leaps and bounds. Just walking in and seeing the first young lady was simply... WOW... then it was like they multiplied  at every turn. Jesus H. Christ, did they grow them specifically to do this job. OMFG, I drooled, legit drooled like I had not eaten in 5 years and someone put a piece of pie in front of me but would not let me touch it.  The service was really good to, not hostess level hot good, but our server was really on top of things and the rest of the wait staff was also very attentive. The old man seemed to enjoy his food as did I. Was it worth the cost, pretty close, but we are in a casino eatery, it of course is going to be expensive. I knew that coming in. The group of hostess ladies though... holy shit. It has been like 4 hours since we left and I still cannot get them out of my head. Just elegant, beautiful young ladies. I cannot use enough terms to describe how amazing they looked. WOW!",

The staff was attentive and knowledgeable. The waitress made a suggestion for wine with my Dover sole that was fantastic. Steaks were perfectly cooked and very flavorful. Sides are large, easily serving the three of us. Creme brulee was delicious, not too sweet. On the downside, the meal was pricey, over $400 for three people. This included an app, entree, and side each, plus one cocktail, a beer, and two glasses of wine plus 2 desserts. However, we did walk out with leftovers for two day's worth of lunches, so it wasn't as much as it seemed.",

I especially love the pretzel bread and will often times just asks for that bread only in the basket.  The lounge area also has live music which is sort of rare for Las Vegas restaurants.  The ambiance is great. Casual yet sophisticated.  The servers are always friendly and thank us for coming in.  This restaurant is a little on the pricier side especially since it is off the strip, but not overpriced (it is inside the red rock hotel and casino).  Appetizers will run you $10-$18, salads will run you $12-$18 (I really enjoy the kale salad), and entrees will run you $25-$120 ($25 for a burger and $120 for a 42oz bone in tbone). Sides and deserts range from $10-$12.",

I made reservations at 7, arrived and was seated right on time in a fantastic booth. The decor in the restaurant is elegant and classy and the staff is dressed to the nines. So great 1st impression.  Next we met our server Junior, he was awesome!  I had my mom and two 15 year olds with me. Junior explained the menu, made great suggestions and was patient with my party, who can be difficult.  The food?  Where do I start?  We started with crab cakes, just as good if not better than what I ate in Maryland (we actually ordered seconds). Beef carpaccio was omg, incredible, we shared the French onion soup and the presentation was just as good as the flavor. I had to try the tater tots, and they did not disappoint. They were delicious. I didn't know if we had room for entrees after all of that, but we made room!  I had the filet. Best. Steak. Ever. Mom had the ribeye which was huge, and the kids had the New York. All of the steaks were cooked PERFECTLY. And then the kids topped everything off with deep fried Oreos. Five stars all the way. The service from the hostesses to the server, to the busser was impeccable. And the meal was impressive!",

Our party of 3 had the lobster rolls, the steakhouse salad, prime burger and the Reuben potatoes. I was blown away by the lobster rolls! So tasty, and served on pretzel rolls, which is awesome. We had to try the Reuben potatoes, which is a side dish. They were pretty good, tho I was expecting something more exciting! The prime burger was rated good, but maybe not worthy of the $28 price tag. The salad was a good size to split, and our server offered to have that done for us without asking!   We sat at a high top near the patio doors, which had a nice view of the restaurant's patio area. Happy Hour isn't what is used to be. There are no food discounts, only $8.50 cocktail specials and a regular price food menu that includes the $16 regular price lobster rolls. Seriously tho, those lobster rolls, the stuff dreams are made of!",

There is a couple of cocktails we normally order. Normally I don't look at our bill,  I am not sure what made me look at the check this time.  My wife had Ordered a Berry-Licious priced at $15 we were charged $17 I ordered Manhattan priced at $16 I was charged $17 2d Manhattan $16 I was charged $23  We simply asked waitress for a menu, she did and we checked the prices so we called  a manager.  It was almost midnight we are last table, took him about 10-15 min to show up to our table.  We pointed the difference in the menu prices and our Bill. His response was that they just had changed their menu and these are the new prices. I told him that if that were True they should change the menu first and then change the prices.  Anyway I continued with, fair enough why is the 2d Manhattan $7 more than the first one, it's the same drink.  He stuttered a little and answered that he will adjust the prices to what the price in the menu are.  I want to ask Managers out there is this happened in their bar/restaurant... would that be the appropriate answer.   Also is that a normal practice for the bar to overcharge their customers hoping they are drunk enough not to notice.",

    "text": "During my one night stay at Red Rock, I decided to go to T-Bones.  It was a pleasurable experience.  I had Team 8 and they worked together to make service top notch.  First, I was brought my iced tea and then came a selection of rolls from a basket.  I got the pretzel and jalapeno rolls.  There were three other flavors but other than pumpernickel, I don't remember the other two.  I later was asked if I wanted more but I passed.  I didn't want to fill up on bread.  I opted for the regular filet which is 11 ounces, done blue. My server pointed out some new items on the menu and I went with the Alaskan king crab salad on a bed of avocado and with orange and grapefruit slices.   The salad was excellent.  Good sized pieces of crab and the citrus worked well with both the avocado and the crab.   The filet was rare but it could have been grilled less and I would have been happier.  For a side, I got French fries.  As with most places, sides in a steakhouse are meant to be shared.  I didn't finish the fries because i had my mind set on dessert, of course.  For dessert, I got their peanut butter caramel sundae--a chocolate brownie, caramel ice cream, peanut butter mousse, chocolate ganache, and caramel popcorn.  It was very good and a great way to end the meal.  They now have a four course chef's tasting menu and it looks like I'll have to pay another visit soon.  PS:  They now use liquid tea light candles which are much nicer than the plastic phony candles for which I criticized them in my first review.",

    "text": "T-Bones is top drawer in all aspects. Reservations are suggested. Located in the casino just outside the Red Rock Resort doors, the restaurant is beautiful. High ceilings and windows open up the room. The bar is big with bottles displayed to the ceiling. The white table clothed dining area is large with a fire place in the center. Service is A+. The manager stopped by our table and chatted. Our servers were professional and pleasant, not stuffy. The menu has \"reasonably\" priced appetizers and side dishes. Steaks and fish dishes are pricey. Everything we had was perfect, therefore delicious. Following comments by Yelpers we chose the large meaty crab cakes to start--the best. Oysters were not salty. The French onion soup could have been a meal. The prime rib was large and red rare in the middle and medium on the outside. We all had a mouth-watering taste. We could have shared it. The Dover sole was reminiscent of many meals in Belgium. Outstanding. The sides to share that we chose were creamed spinach and roasted sweet potatoes. A perfect compliment to our meals. We finished with coffees from a nice selection.",

    "text": "I hate to give T-bones a bad review but the service we had last night 7/3 was just terrible. We were a 5 top that wanted happy hour and the hostesses knew this but still sat us in a non happy hour spot. We asked for the 6 top high top by the bar and they said it wasn't happy hour even though there was another group at the next high top over getting happy hour.  Hostesses were in general just rude, probably because we were dressed in casual wear as we just came from the pool but they should be more friendly regardless of our attire.  We ordered the large seafood tower, tuna tartar, beef carpaccio, wedge and heirloom tomatoes. Everything was delicious. Server ( older lady named Ronnie) was annoyed we didn't order entrees even though she knew we were at T-bones for happy hour which they didn't give us. We also ordered 3 desserts which were great as well.   Server was basically non existent throughout the meal just her assist which did majority of the work. After Ronnie dropped the check it took 20-30min for her to come back and get the bill. Saw her plenty of times look over at us but never once came to grab the bill. $300 check for a 5 top to start the night you should be in a better mood and not rude or become a shit server. Once Ronnie finally came over to process payment and she saw the $60 in cash we left, her whole attitude changed and then started being friendly and conversational. Asking us where we're from and if we're watching the fireworks.   My girlfriend and I both work at restaurants on the strip and have worked at restaurants in Red Rock and Ronnies service was that of a bitter old lady till she saw the 20% cash tip then she wanted to be nice. Screw that. T-bones dropped the ball from the beginning with the rude hostesses and then not accommodating us with Happy Hour when they knew that's what we wanted.  Our attire shouldn't matter, you should understand people are coming in from the pool to grab food and drinks before the fireworks.",

I made reservations for my boyfriend and I, and we arrived hungry and ready to enjoy our time.   We were sat on the patio and given water by our busser. He presented us with the regular menu and we asked for the restaurant week menu to which he replied \"absolutely, I'll be right back\". When the waiter came, everything went downhill. We asked for the restaurant week menu and he stated that \"the buttons weren't working\" so they aren't starting restaurant week until tomorrow. Excuse me? can you advertise that? not only that, but how difficult is it to honor the prices?   We walked out and ended up going to Hearthstone and were able to enjoy their restaurant week menu.   First time at TBones, and I'm extremely disappointed.",

The service of the staff was definitely the highlight above it all. Our server, Stormy, was very attentive and did an excellent job with taking care of our orders and our drinks. She dropped by periodically to keep our drinks filled and she really made the visit all the more enjoyable.  She was charming and gave the best service I've had at a restaurant!

Update: This guy \"James S.\" who was trash talking me at the bar has continued his harassment through sending me a nasty message through Yelp. I assume management spoke to him about his behavior and since he can't continue to trash talk me in person, he has now decided to harass me over the internet.

    "text": "I had just gotten to Vegas with my friend and we wanted to check out the Red Rock hotel to scout out the sportsbook for World Cup viewing and get a bite to eat while we were at it. We walked around the place for a while and settled on a steak dinner at T-Bones. Now, the prices are definitely on the higher side and with a 3.5 star average on Yelp I had some slight reservations. I couldn't have been more wrong.  We came in and were seated pretty quickly. They brought us our water glasses and one of the most unique bread baskets I've ever seen. Of all the things I didn't take a picture of SMH. Started with the crab cake appetizer and this was my first time having them. If they taste like these did, I'm going to get them more often. For dinner, I went with a simple bone in ribeye and it was phenomenal. Lightly seasoned and perfectly cooked. Melts in your mouth. For sides we went with the mushrooms and roasted sweet potatoes. The mushrooms were good and I don't care for sweet potatoes unless they are fried but these changed my mind. I'm not sure what sauce was used but it was freaking delicious.  Service was incredible. I think the guy doing the water glasses had some radar going off when my glass went half full. Mad man. The waiter did an amazing job of explaining the menu and telling us some of the goodies that weren't on there and the wine sommelier did an awesome job with the pairing. T-Bone's was a huge surprise for me. Yeah, the name is kinda goofy and now that I think of it I don't think I saw t-bone steak on the menu but ooh wee the food was delicious. Definitely the surprise of my trip!",

I was actually worried because I made the reservation BEFORE I read the reviews, but I'm so glad I still went through with our plans, regardless of what I'd read.  We went with another couple to celebrate our anniversary, and truly enjoyed every item we ordered.  The bread basket was a nice start, it contained a varied selection including pretzel bread, olive bread, raisin bread, and thin large cracker-type bread.  Very interesting and tasty.  In general, this restaurant offers extremely large portions, even the salad.  The baked potatoes were enormous (I recommend splitting) and one order of asparagus was enough to feed all four of us.  This is great because the items are a la carte, and can add up quickly.  The meat selections were the most expensive, but delectable - totally worth it.  (We had filet mignon and another guest actually had buffalo, he loved it.)  They bring you various sauces for the meat and we ordered a delicious side of sauteed mushrooms - YUM.  Make sure to do that.  Add in an impressive wine list and this place was perfect.  Oh, for dessert, you have to try the fried oreos.  They are divine - they taste like a melted oreo inside funnel cake, and they come with vanilla ice cream.  Heavenly.  I have nothing negative to say, but expect to pay about $100 per person if you have a couple of glasses of wine.",

    "text": "I would have only given one star,however, one of the three servers assigned to our table  (the female) was on the ball and actually provided service!  The water boy was rude. The waiter was hardly present. The restaurant was pretty empty-- maybe a fourth full. No big parties.    I had a wedge salad.  My husband had tomato and mozzarella salad  The wedge lettuce was crispy and fresh but had too much salad dressing. The tomato and mozzarella salad lacked a flavorful balsamic vinegar and it was watery.   I ordered a filet cooked medium plus. Pink, no blood. The waiter thought I should butterfly it!  Seriously?!?  Okay, the waiter was undereducated but certainly the chefs wouldn't be, right? Wrong! I expected a steak house to serve a perfectly cooked steak. I received a rare steak--actually the middle was raw, cold and purple.  After several minutes and literally flagging down one of the three servers, the female, my steak was taken back to be cooked more. When the steak was returned to me I was told it had just come off the heat and would I cut it. Ugh, they wanted me to cut into a steak without giving it time to rest!  This is a fine steakhouse?    My husband had finally had it, asked them to take everything back. Our plan to eat a meal together-- without kids-- was foiled by incompetence. At this point, the wine steward/acting manager came to the table and tried to make things better, but the meal and our date night was ruined. We paid for the two glasses of wine my husband drank and left--hungry and disappointed. You would think that at least one of his glasses of wine would have been comped.",

We stood there for a good 5 minutes and then finally decided to leave. We went to another bar, but was told this was the only one that had an outdoor lounge so we came back. We ordered a couple beers from the outside bar, but it closed early. When we went inside to order a couple more beers, it took a good 20 minutes to be helped. There was another girl in there who had been waiting for 25 minutes for her drinks. 1 of the waitresses had took her order and then walked away and didn't come back. Someone else ended up getting her drinks half an hour after she ordered the 1st ones. I wanted 2 coors lights and it took a good 30 minutes to get 2 bottles of beer. These guys were far too wrapped up in closing the bar than helping customers.",

I live in Summerlin so I stopped in in person a week ahead to make reservations for last Saturday night. I told the waitress I had family coming and it was a special occasion so we wanted a nice table. She said 'well, then you certainly want a booth in the main dining room. The bar tables would be too noisy'. So we arrive, and after waiting 25 minutes past the reservation time we finally are told the only table is...you guessed it, in the bar!  Food was average, server Gabrielle could not keep up. His helper, Junior was great! After a drawn out dinner, we ordered desert and waited 25 minutes...ridiculous. Gave it another chance last night. 3 of us stopped for drinks and appetizers. Hostess said the only place they would seat us for drinks and apps was a high top in bar right by piano and patio entrance door. I asked about other free tables in the bar...she smugly said they were for 'full dinner only'. It was 5:00 and the place was near empty...better tables were available. The ladies in dresses got a cold breeze each time the door was opened. $350 in drinks and apps and we were treated like we were not wanted and $350 was being cheap.  Too many other choices. We will not go back and suggest you avoid it too. The attitude of the staff we encountered combined with average food....Red Rock should be ashamed.",

I snatched the last reso at T-Bones and it did not disappoint for Thanksgiving day dinner!   We ordered (2) bottles of wine and a few cocktails which were all good. For starters we had the Lobster Bisque, Oysters and Cocktail Shrimp. The bread basket was pretty good too..very fresh!   For dinner we ordered the Filet, New York Strip, T -Bone and a prime burger all very good. A few of us added the crust compliments as well. The sides were AMAZING especially the mushrooms and creamed corn. Our sweet tooth craving prompted us to order the sundae and WARM BUTTER TOFFEE CAKE! This cake was EVERYTHING!   Sooo good our service was amazing too. It was Thanksgiving and all of the staff had a smile on their face. Thank you T-bone for an awesome #ThanksgivingDinner2015",

After being seated we learned that there is no ordering from the regular menu at all ultimately had to leave.

Wedge salad was split ahead of time to share, scallops seared perfectly as well as steak done as ordered. It was very easy to swap out sides. Wait staff works in 2 man teams so we never wanted for anything- drinks refilled immediately and plates cleared at the Appropriate times.  The waiter recognized it was our anniversary and provided us with a special desert. Note this is a nice steakhouse so the decor, linens and other guests were all well dressed and extremely well done up. Even the live music created a warm environment for us to enjoy our meal and time with each other in conversation. Never at any point did we feel pressure to leave early.

(too much employee chatter, not enough work)  Our waiter was fine.  I ordered one of the steak specials which at $52 for about 6 ounces of meat was fairly pricey.  It was delicious but with 2 drinks and a tip it was nearing $100.  It wasn't *that* good.   There are a few other places I can think of that are equally good for less and as my every experience at Red Rock is that they are \"strip\" and not \"locals\"... I guess inflated prices go with it.",

Ahi tuna tacos looked small. I had 2 bloody marys at $8 each.  I haven't ever been a fan of their food, on 3 visits it just wasn't that good or spectacular considering the price. My last steak here was over 2 years ago so things change, go with the more recent reviews.

I was disappointed it was hidden in back of Red Rock Casino and a little hard to find. The dining room was one of the most gorgeous restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of dining in. The decor was simply stunning with lighting, design, fireplace, floor space, tables were spaced appropriately to enjoy conversation, the music (both live entertainment in the bar and in the dining room) was not too loud yet made the experience fun and lively. The bar both inside and out were gorgeous and comfortable. The fire pit outside has comfortable seating and is gorgeous - would be fun with a large group. Amazing fireplace inside were we sat. Very romantic yet I could easily have a business dinner here as well. The Bartender was truly a professional and perfectionist because this is the first time I have ever seen a Bartender use a straw and taste a drink prior to serving it to insure taste! Our Server and Busser introduced themselves and immediately asked who's birthday it was! I was impressed! When I made the reservation, I was asked if it was a special occasion. Usually I have to remind the Hostess and Server at some point during the meal that we are there for a special occasion. Although the restaurant was full and busy, Our Server and Busser checked on us frequently and spent time getting to know us and shared about themselves. The staff here is superior, exceptional and outstanding! One of the very few restaurants I have been to were the food was as magnificent as the service! Through the years, we have been to STK, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Del Fresco, Flemings, The Strip House, Gallaghers, The Palm, etc. Hands down T-Bones has the best food, service and atmosphere of them all. The outside patio was stunning. Perfect weather. Beautiful fire pit. The inside dining room and bar are amazing. I had gone on Yelp prior to my visit and I was not disappointed. T-Bones was as advertised!",

    "text": "T-bones is one of the many steak house that Station Casino has to offer. I would probably have to rank this up there with the best.   Located at Red Rock Station Casinos off Charleston and 215. It may be a long drive but well worth the view. Red Rock itself is a very nice place, but focusing on T-bones, the restaurant is amazing on its own. The place was very roomy and very well decorated. Got lots of room to move around, and nice seating arrangements. Not to crowded is how I like it.   Arriving to T-bones, we're greeted by the receptionist who checked us in and our Host Dave was nice enough to direct us to our booth. He helped us be seated. He was very informative and entertaining as well. A few seconds later we were greeted by Ricardo, who offered to get us some drinks. Shortly afterward we were greeted by Darlene, who took our order. They were all very informative and entertaining as well. This being our first time at the restaurant, Darlene gave us a lot of inside scoop on what they have regarding the view of the pool, to what they do at catering parties and holidays. Over all, the staff was very excellent on helping us out. One thing that did get to me is the refills on drinks, was a bit on the slow side. Then again, I understand it was beginning of the dinner rush, so they got busy in the end of our visit.   The food itself, was amazing. The wife and I got Fillet Mignon, she got the 8 ounce and I got the 12 ounce, both medium.  We also got the shrimp for starters, then sweet potato fries and macaroni for our sides.  The presentation was very well done, and taste was really great.  The Fillet Mignon itself was very well cooked just the way I like it.  I understand others may not get their food prepared the way they want. But I for one, like the way it was cooked and presented.    Dessert, I had the Fried Oreo, which was very good and tasty.  It had ice cream on the side, so it made it more wonderful to eat.  The wife had a banana split, and to be honest, its like any other banana split out there, but very good.    Over all, I really did enjoy myself and highly recommended when looking for a steakhouse.  The pricing might be up there, I would probably say 60-80 bucks per person.  But I believe its well worth it.  The view of the restaurant, and Red Rock itself.  With the informative waiters and the energy they bring.  To the presentation of your food and the quality of it.  I believe its very well priced.",

I had a great steak that was cooked to perfection. All the staff were friendly and willing to help. Place was clean and would be a great date night with my wife. Pricing for a steakhouse was average.

The ambiance is nice with live music on the weekends but not too loud where you can still enjoy conversations. My husband and I split the steakhouse salad (it is perfect to split between two and they split it for you) and I love that it is chopped. I usually get the bone in rib eye. It is always delicious and comes with a yummy dipping sauce. I have also gotten the Dover sole in the past which is also delicious! For dessert, I usually get the warm butter toffee cake which is deliciousness. My husband got the deep fried Oreos which were also surprising delicious. Service is also excellent. We had about 3 different people always checking on us. We even brought our 14 month old who enjoyed the yam, creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes! It was a great experience, but that's usually the case at T-Bones!",

Service is excellent and attentive.  But of course, you're there for the food. The steaks are uniformly excellent. My New York strip was delicious, with nice texture, and cooked perfectly. Other steaks at the table were as good. Sides are very good, but not wonderful. My onion soup was quite good. We didn't have desert, but the ones delivered to other tables looked great, with the beignets looking especially interesting.  If you're at the Red Rock and you want to splurge, T-Bones is a good choice.",

It comes with a good selection of tiger prawns, oysters, crab and lobster. In the past it also came with a little bowl of crab. Today it did not and it was missed a bit but still worth the money and a great way to start the meal. The soups and salad were all good ( French onion, lobster chowder and Caesar). For dinner we each ordered steaks. They came out at the proper temperature and had a good flavor but do not compare to Mortons or Carnovino. We had three sides which are good sized and able to be shared: the creamed spinach, the creamed corn, which is great and should be ordered without doubt, and the asparagus, which is a bit bland but fresh. The desserts were all very good and huge. The wine list is extensive and I was able to find a good red that didn't bankrupt us. The only disappointment was my Grey Goose and tonic. It  tasted like the tonic was going flat and that the bartender didn't use Grey Goose. Throughout the meal the service was very good. We definitely enjoyed our Christmas meal and would recommend T-Bones.",

    "text": "WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! YOU RUINED MY BIRTHDAY EVENING!!  If you want to get any sort of service from this place, make sure to have cash on you to tip the bartender before even ordering your drinks just to get his attention. The bartender outside ignored the fact that we were standing at the outside bar patiently for 15-20 mins. He finally took our order but another customer came up and threw him a $20, all of a sudden our order gets deleted from his brain and he helps this gentleman instead of us. We never got our drinks after that. And we normally give tips after a service is provided , NOT before, but if thats how things operate over here, I don't ever plan to go back here. i ended up telling the bartender to just forget our order and that I thought his behavior was awful.    After we had to deal with that, we decided to try the bar inside the restaurant. Again, waited for another 15 mins and still got no service. They weren't even busy! Not once did any of the bartnders approach us to take our order. At this point, I was so upset and I was convinced my birthday was ruined. I just wanted to go home and call it a night. We just left very upset and disappointed with our experience. I work in a hotel on the strip and customer service is our main focus, this establishment has NO clue what that means. And trust me when I say ALL my friends, family and coworkers will hear about this. I won't even recommend this place to my worst enemy!  We ended up at another restaurant in the casino, we sat at the bar and promptly got service from the bartender. we ended up telling her our horrible experience we just had at T bones and her exact words were... \" I hear that ALL the time!\"  the other bartender walked over while we were talking and agreed that he hears it all the time how horrible the service is at the T-Bone Steakhouse.   How can an establishment with such a horrible reputation in service stay in business?   If you want to save money by not spending any of it at a restaurant that doesn't serve you or take your order, this is the perfect place for you. I had better service at Dick's Last Resort and they are allowed to be jerks in their work place. T-Bone Steakhouse is a natural at not caring about their customers. You just lost yourself a customer!",

The decor and atmosphere is really nice, we sat at the bar for a birthday party, my wife and I both ordered the 11oz filet, and I had jumbo shrimp cocktail with it, she  (very good) had a wine to drink and I had a Pellegrino.  The tab came to $175.  Wait staff is friendly.  Where it went wrong was the waiter who brought our steaks out screwed up our order, my wife's steak was supposed to be medium/well and mine was supposed to be medium rare.  When I ate mine, I thought it was overdone quite a bit and really didn't enjoy it much, and when she ate hers, she thought it wasn't cooked enough, but it wasn't until about 3/4 the way through dinner that we commented on our meals and realized the waiter mixed them up (Birthday party, chatting with others around us and not scrutinizing our food and commenting on it with each other immediately).  When the bartender asked if everything was ok, we mentioned it and she felt bad and wanted to try to rectify it, but at that point, we both weren't that hungry anymore.  When we were ready to cash out, we waited at least 15 minutes to request the check, which she brought pretty quick once we asked, but when I signed it and put my credit card in with the receipt, it was still another 15 minutes before another bartender finally took it, so it was a half hour just to settle up with the check.  The 2 stars go to the decor and atmosphere, as well as the shrimp cocktail and the friendliness of the wait staff and bartenders, but the actual quality of the service lacked and was enough of a downer to knock down the review to 2 stars.  For a $175 dinner for 2, how hard is it to get those little indicators you poke into the meat to tell the server which one is which?  Will I come here again?  If I'm invited to another get together, sure, but I won't suggest it or make plans to go here on my own.",

My wife and I wanted a special dinner to celebrate the new year so we chose T-Bones as we were staying at the Red Rock Hotel where T-Bones is located.   The service was top notch and everyone was very friendly. We ordered drinks from the bar and they were promptly brought to us. Silvia, our server, was great and helped us choose our steaks. My wife got the 8 oz filet and for me the Bone-in Ribeye.   The steaks, to be honest, were good but not the best we have had. I know that they are thick steaks but both of our steaks were a bit over cooked. Not to much but noticeable, not being picky we ate them just fine. Like I said they were good but flavor wise we have had better at the likes of Ruth's Chris and Hugo's Cellar.  The asparagus that we got was cooked great, but was luke warm. Still good though. The mashed potatoes were fantastic.   We ended with some DELICIOUS fried oreo's. No seriously they were awesome and I highly recommend them.  In all it was a very nice night. But when I review a place value is at or near the top of my criteria and that is were T-bones falls a bit short for me. Our total bill was a touch over $200, and I just felt in the end that for that kind of money I want my mind blown and it just wasn't. Would I go here again? Absolutely. But it wouldn't be on the very top of my list.",

I've been a chef for most of my life and I'm pretty sure i figured out what the cooks are doing. Because of the medium request, they are cooking the steak in the salamander. Because, both times the outside is burned to a crisp. Tastes nasty but both times, the company I'm with, I don't really feel comfortable being...that guy. The guy that complains and ruins the atmosphere. My guests food is always perfect so I don't want to interrupt even though I know I should. The last time I went was in December. If they are still doing the same thing then I can't even blame the cooks. The chef is not doing his job. He needs to be watching for quality for every dish before it goes out to service but obviously he's not. He's supposed to expedite each place. I can smell the burned edges. That's how badly it's burned. You can see in the picture how badly it's burned. Will not go back...ever. That's inexcusable. One time was...maybe. Twice? Absolutely no. They also advertise wagyu. But, any American steakhouse that serves this type is required to show a certificate of authenticity. They don't. This place is way overpriced for this kind of mistakes and misleading advertising. Thoroughly disappointed. First time my bill was over $200. This time was almost $200. I can get better steak at outback or black Angus.",

It all tasted great.    I started with the Lobster Chowder, which is INCREDIBLY rich and creamy, but so good.  It's just very filling.  You could eat it as a meal.  My Dad had the Tomato/Mozzarella appetizer, which also looked great.  The buffala mozzarella was so creamy and the heirloom tomatoes were beautiful.  We each had the 8oz. Grass Fed Filet Mignon (and yes, being grass fed makes a huge difference in steak taste.  it is awesome).   The steaks were cooked perfectly to our liking.    And we each split an order of spinach and a baked potato.  The whole meal was outstanding.   The service was great.  We had Darlene and Roni waiting on us and they didn't miss a beat.  They were very friendly.  They knew the menu well and their recommendations were spot on, especially the wine they recommended.  It was excellent.  My one complaint is like a lot of casinos and that the cigarette smoke drifts into the restaurant and you can still smell it while you're eating.  I recommend having closed doors going into these restaurants as it will help in keeping the nasty air out until casinos I hope one day will wise up and get rid of the horrible smoking all together.  But overall, I was most impressed with this place and the food was awesome.  Highly recommended.",

I sat at the bar and ordered Oysters, the Kitchen Sink Caesar Salad and the Lobster Chowder.  I noticed that those seated at tables were given water and large bread baskets with butter.  Half way through my meal I asked about the bread basket... I was told that 'at the bar\" you need to ASK... wt hell?  I said, are the prices different at the bar.  Nope... Same.  I asked Jason what he thought of this... and the fact that I was made to feel like a totally \"beggar\" for asking for the bread basket.  He said that service and expectations SHOULD be consistent across the restaurant whether you are seated at the bar or at a table.  I agree.  Thanks Jason - good luck with training and I give you 4 stars for listening and making me believe you genuinely want to make things right.  For the prices - it needs to be.... Totally worth paying for if done right!!!.... here's something that should make corporate sit up and listen.  I ordered a double single malt scotch and never was asked if I'd like another.  The minute that staff saw me talking to the manager 'Jason\" they all scurried and avoided me like the plague - making the whole evening even more uncomfortable.  I was perfunctorily asked if I wanted desert - like you don't really want any do you? And of course I declined.  Lets see... another drink and desert probably an additional $50 in revenue x how many people get treated like this per week/mo. = what?  Even I can do the math...",

    "text": "This is the review for their happy hour.  The Skinny:  so-so on the verge of mediocre food (2.5) service: we were at the bar and it was okay (3) value: extremely expensive and certainly not worth the expense. Avoid! (2).  I've never been a real fan of steakhouses however we recently received a coupon in the mail for $25 off $50 purchase at T-bones. The hubs previously had been there for their happy hour specials and suggested we do this because their regular menu is vastly overpriced. As well, he stipulated that we were not to go on Friday because they charge extra tax for live entertainment. Not usually one to enjoy live music with dinner (I'm more a quiet sort), I agreed.  So we get there right at 5pm and put down our order: a Beef on Weck ($19), Ahi Tuna tacos ($9), Buffalo Chicken Bites ($10), Chicken and Waffles ($10) and Lobster Corn Dogs ($10).  I have no idea what they were thinking charging this much for such subpar cuisine.   Beef on Weck = Beef on Wreck. It was essentially overcooked prime rib on the equivalent of a Wonderbread bun smothered in bland (thickened with corn starch) au jus. The amount of au jus just killed the dish, making the bread all weird and mucky. It reminded me of the sh*(ty recipes they made us try during home ec class from like a 50's cookbook (let's make Welsh rarebit using Velveta - nasty!). Albeit it was large and came with fries, I'd wager you'd get a better beef sammy at Arbys for about 1/4 of the price. Lame!  The buffalo chicken bites although the flavors were okay, the lack of crispiness really killed it. If you are going to deep fry chicken bites, I want to taste to deep fried goodness. Otherwise what's the point of adding all those extra calories?  Lobster corn dogs were also very weak = too much coating, too little lobster plagued this completely forgettable dish. It comes with two small lobster corndogs.  Ahi Tuna Tacos were okay. There were three small tacos, with some low grade ahi-tuna dressed with avocado. Solid but nothing you couldn't get elsewhere.  The chicken and waffles were also edible and possibly the best dish of the night. The coating of the chicken was okay and the hit of the jalapeno was nice. The waffle was nothing special and I would argue hit too heavily on the vanilla side. I'm not so sure but as a rule: vanilla + savory = bleh. 'Nuff said.  Overall, given the subpar food alone - I would generally not recommend this place at all. Throw in the ripe off prices, I'd say avoid this place like the plague. (2 starred review).",

    "text": "My best friend and I went here for an impromptu birthday dinner after we spent the day at the spa.  It wasn't packed, but it looked fairly busy.  I like the decor of the restaurant.  It's very warm and inviting.  But speaking of warm!  They sat us at a table by the long fireplace in the middle of the restaurant and it was overly warm!  I was sitting on the other side of the table and had to strip down to a tank top.  We should have asked to be moved right away but it seemed bearable at first.  However, by the time we were done with dinner, we were both roasting.  First off, the service is super slow.  They are really nice and friendly, but just so SLOW!  It took forever for someone to take our order.  We both ordered lobster chowder to start with.  I felt it was pretty bland.  There was a lot of corn and potatoes and about 2 small pieces of lobster.  I was not impressed.  After that, it was probably about 30 minutes from after they cleared our lobster chowder plates before they started bringing out our dinner.  We ordered the chateaubriand, which they slice tableside.  We asked for medium rare but it was definitely more rare, which I was okay with but my friend wanted it just a tadbit closer to medium rare.  They gave me my part since I was okay with rare, and they took her pieces back to throw back on for a little bit.  We also ordered the hashbrowns, which came with a sunny-side up egg on top.  The Chateaubriand comes with potatoes and vegetables.  We waited a good 5 minutes before they came back with her steak, and when they did, it was completely overcooked, almost to medium well.  Since we had already waited so long for our food and didn't want to be big complainers, we just said it was fine.  What a massive disappointment.  By the time they brought her steak back, everything on our table had gone cold.    The overall experience was just okay.  I really think that if they hadn't been SOOOO slow with the service, this might have been a 4-star experience.  The other thing that really sucked was our $99 chateaubriand being cooked at the wrong temp, TWICE. With so many awesome restaurants available and at that price, I probably won't eat there again.",

The steaks was way over priced including meal; everything is sold separately if you want rice, veg. Potatoes, etc., sold as an Entre way over priced, not included with steak, just throughout it was the worst part of staying and dining at the Red Rock casio which is the best hotel in Vegas with the exception of having this restaurant in its hotel that discriminates and has the worst steaks and price and service. I think you guys better post a dress code and state that its strictly endorsed and don't just decide based on color who can enter regardless of what they are wearing and be treated with respect, and hopefully you will start acknowledging hotel guest a little better or else you will definitely have a lawsuit on your hands I bet that........................",

    "text": "Surprisingly good. Like my visit to Twin Creeks at the Silverton a couple weeks ago, T-Bones is a steakhouse I never thought much about, but was glad I tried. The look of the place is impressive. It's got an upscale, modern feel with some comfy looking booths and a large fireplace in the center of the dining area.   To start, we got the crab cakes ($18). The waiter said the crabs were from the Philippines. \"I've never had Filipino crabs before,\" I replied. My wife snickered and said, \"I hope not.\" The humor was lost on our waiter.  The order came with two sizeable crab cakes. They had little filler and large chunks of crab meat. Although the crab meat looked darker than your typical Maryland crab meat and wasn't as sweet.  Next up was an order of the Tbones Steakhouse salad ($12). It was a large serving that they split for us at the table. It was one of the better salads I've had in a while, with it's chopped lettuce, tomatoes, bleu cheese dressing and chunks of bacon. You can never go wrong with bacon.  For our entree we split the 12 oz. filet ($48). Again, they split it for us tableside. It was a delicious cut of beef that was lightly seasoned. At other places (like Cut or Delmonico) they season their steaks so much that the flavor is like getting a swift hard kick in the ass. That can be a god thing if you like bold flavors (I do). Here, the flavor is like a gentle tapping on the shoulder to get your attention.   The waiter brought out complimentary sauces for the steak -- bleu cheese and a bearnaise. I didn't care much for the bearnaise, but the bleu cheese had a sharp and tangy flavor to it that went well with the beef. I don't normally like sauces with my steak, but this was a nice change of pace.  We also ordered two sides -- the garlic mashed potatoes ($10) and the royal trumpet mushrooms ($12). Each was a substantial amount, good enough for a party of four to share. The mashed potatoes were decent but forgettable. The mushrooms were served in a sauce that had the consistency of gray. It smelled amazing and tasted pretty good.  Their dessert menu looked good but we didn't have any room left to eat more. We even had plenty of leftovers to take home.  The service was solid throughout the night. Our main waiter seemed very busy with all of his other tables, but there were other waiters who stopped by to check in and take additional drink orders.  With drinks, our bill (before tip) came out to $153.50. Not a cheap meal, but cheaper than many options on the strip and the quality was very good. It's definitely worth a return visit.",

Ordered a couple of old fashioneds to start and they were mediocre at best and quite expensive. For starters we ordered their version of a caprese salad, but it was just a beefsteak tomato sliced with some mozzarella, no basil and scant balsamic. Not good at all. Main entree we ordered the porterhouse to share. This steak was ginormous and cooked to proper temp despite being very thick. The garlic mashed potatoes were quite good, as well. Because we were celebrating my husband's birthday, they gave him a complimentary creme brulee. Thought that a nice touch. Bill came to well over $160 and we actually had to remind the waiter that we wanted our bottle of water we ordered for the table as all of our refills throughout dinner were tap water.

The sides were also prepared to perfection.  Service was over the top.  Drinks were large and the drink menu is extensive.  Yes, it can be expensive, but the atmosphere, service and food quality more than make up for the price. Plus the portions are large.",

Next time they said we could decide not to have oysters which none of us eat which would leave more amazing Crab, and shirimp.  Then all had soup and all had a salad and dessert.  The Wine (Lancaster )was amazing and the Chalk Hill Chardonay was great by the glass and very reasonable.  Great service and bread basket was very filing.  PLEASE Get rid of Cali Tucker.  She is too loud even in the dinning area,  and they even have her piped into the bathroom arghh.  Whats up with her and that voice synthezier?  Her music choices also do not fit with the restaurant.  We complained to the waiter and he siad 50% of the people say they hate her.  How about some old Vegas music?",

A great romantic or business meeting restaurant to frequent with clients. The back patio is nice to go out onto with friends, especially when the weather is nice. A must for residents for a regular dinner or special occasion. Terrific ambiance and unparalleled service. Will be back, hopefully sooner than later!",

The salads and appetizers were excellent as were the Filet Mignon and Rib Eye..... cooked perfectly and very tasty.  The side dishes of asparagus and mashed potatoes were also excellent. Loved their wine selection as well. It was going great until the servers basically ignored us after we received the main course. Tried getting their attention to no avail. They all were swarming around a celebrity table and pretty much ignored everyone else from that point on. If it was not for this I would have given T Bones 5 Stars. Pricey but really worth it overall",

T-Bones is definitely one of those places you go to on your Birthday, Anniversary, or any special occasion where you just want to be spoiled.   I started with the French onion soup and my husband started with the chop salad. They came out quickly and were delicious. I got the 8 oz grass fed filet cooked medium and it was simply delightful. It's small enough that you can order sides and still have room to eat them! The Au-gratin potatoes and almond green beens are the way to go.  You have multiple servers waiting on you. The food is seasoned to perfection. The vaulted ceilings make it feel so open. The seating is extremely comfortable.  Five stars in my book!",

    "text": "Toqued by Chef Mike Deas with input from Red Rock Assistant Executive Chef Joseph Kudrak, formerly from Glutton, T-Bones Chophouse & Lounge is one of those places easily overlooked by Las Vegas visitors as well as locals, a recent dinner on an early Friday evening leaving one to wonder exactly why, and how to get the word out?  More tucked away than Hearthstone, Lucille's or The Buffet and Grand Cafe, a nearly 200 seat footprint overlooking the Red Rock pool with high ceilings, fireplaces and plenty of polish, T-Bones Chophouse & Lounge both looks and feels like many On-Strip casino Steakhouses, but taking a few more risks with the menu than several the experience is presented as one also more affordable, the price-point not dissimilar to nearby Andiron, Fleming's or Morton's.  Retaining several of its well-mannered Captains from early on, the restaurant's professional-friendly service style reportedly a focus of the Fertitta family who own Station Casinos and visit often, dinner was served in a Prix-fixe fashion and with Chefs Kudrak as well as Deas present that evening the meal was nothing short of a feast for the senses, a $300 tab for sixteen appetizers, entrees, sides and desserts plus one heck of a cocktail and a bread basket that bests any seen recently on Las Vegas Boulevard.  Acknowledging a friend's two-hour time limit, tickets to the UNLV Opera requiring departure just before Seven o'clock, it was at a large semi-circular booth that the meal got started and with greetings from GM Christopher Jurchenkoit was not long before service was underway, the opening trio seeing lightly battered shrimp given a Chinatown treatment while steakhouse staples of French Onion Soup and Crabcakes were as good as any in the city, the former faintly sweet with plenty of bubbling cheese while the \"cake\" was almost pure crab with bright aromatics of paprika, onion and cayenne in the binder.  A bit off-put by the noise emanating from the bar, a combination of March Madness revelry, Friday Happy Hour and music piped in from the Gaming Floor, round two followed quickly and although fresh-cut potatoes could have been more crispy, \"Perfect Poutine\" was quite a bargain at just $10 when taking into account all the confit, cheese and skin, the Steakhouse Salad equally well constructed as chopped Romaine blended nicely with Avocado, Bacon and Gorgonzola beneath creamy French Dressing.  Not even 1/3 finished at this point, course three a six-piece exposition of two entrees and four sides, gone are the days of piddly portions at CUT or PRIME as Au Gratin Potatoes, Hashbrowns, Mushrooms and Creamed Corn are all built for sharing, as too is the two-piece Fried Chicken with Sage Gravy while the Beef selections range from American Wagyu to New York Prime from Niman Ranch, the latter in our case served Medium with a topping of fresh Lobster, Asparagus and Bearnaise.  Bathed by the setting sun with blinds offering only modest relief as a result of floor-to-ceiling windows that give the room part of its grand appeal, dessert was taken to the patio as music turned live in the Lounge and although admittedly already quite sated none of the five options proved less than worth the temptation, the Carrot Cake and Souffle both straight forward classics alongside Cheesecake that trends far lighter than most followed by indulgent blueberry donuts and a frozen parfait plus Sticky Toffee Pudding  that falls just short of Gordon Ramsay's for best in The Valley.  **** Easily overlooked in a city where Steakhouses rule the day, T-Bones Chophouse & Lounge is a great spot for those inhabiting Summerlin to grab a Cocktail or snacks at Happy Hour and an even better one for al fresco patio dining, the price point more favorable than spots on The Strip while the menu outpaces other places nearby in terms of both creativity and quality of sourcing.",

We ordered crab cakes, filet mignon, and au gratin potatoes. The crab cakes were good, but nothing special. For the price I've had better. The filet was good. We had it cooked medium. I felt the inside was cooked to satisfaction but the outside felt too well done but overall I liked it. The au gratin potties were good and great for sharing. It is a very heavy dish and I only wanted a small portion.  For dessert we got the Warm Toffee Cake. It tasted really good and was my favorite part of the meal. I'm such a sucker for a good dessert. The waitress recommended this and I'm glad she did.  Overall, good meal (3/5) but excellent service (5/5) hence the 4/5 rating.",

The steaks and salad were good, but the side dish we ordered came burned to a crisp!  Why would a chef even give that to the waiter to serve and why would a waiter serve it?  There are way too many other really great restaurants to eat at in Vegas to bother with this place.  Their sister property, Hank's at GVR is one of them.

However, a big thank you to Gene (or Jean) and Mark for standing out last night during my mom's birthday dinner! We decided to come out to T Bone to have a nice dinner and they added the nice to our dinner. They weren't even our main server who was a snob by the way. That's a different story! Thank you to the new gentlemen who catered to our every need. One of them heard we discussing jelly and mint chimichurri to add to my lamb chops and without hesitation it was at our table within seconds. I shared the order of rack of lamb with my brother and they were so polite and professional cutting the lamb table side and served us. As well as when I asked for melted butter they served us within seconds. It was really nice and I felt like they truly went out of their way not only for us but other tables nearby.   I was disappointed that T Bone only had 3.5 stars on Yelp. It's truly a beautiful steakhouse and perfect to celebrate any occasion or a nice night out. The quality of the food was great! My family and I started with Seafood Jackpot!! Although it was amazing I still have had better. The portions were great and sadly I didn't get to snap a pic because we all dived in. Oh and another trademark of my adventures at steakhouses was the bread basket! It was excellent and the the seasoned butter was winning in my book. The rack of lamb was decent again I've had better. The fried Oreos were delicious and tasted just like their sister property steakhouse Hanks! The creme brulee was uh... mediocre. I guess 3.5-4 stars suites them well. A few adjustments including friendlier host and main server would help as well. If you've never been they treat yourself here one time for the one time!",

They have raised their prices significantly (enough that we noticed and didn't order what we normally would have). Boo. I would have gone somewhere else honestly but we were already seated and it was too late to get up. There are some new things on the menu though. The steak prices went up at least $10 I think. The fried chicken meal was $36. Their beef Wellington was around $68. Those are strip prices imo. It all matters because the side items are sold a la carte (around $16 for runny mashed potatoes) so it all adds up and money doesn't grow on trees at my house lol. We will not be back. Charcoal Room is a lot better for the price!!",

We came in around 5pm or 6 and it was crowded but the high top tables were first come first serve so we just ate there instead of waiting an hr for a table. Theres only so much gambling I can do before I lose all my dinner money.   To start, they brought out a bread basket that was to die for. Hands down the best bread basket you'll ever get from any restaurant. It is an assortment of breads; sourdough, pretzel, some sort of garlic and cheese chips, pumpernickel. We killed the basket, and the server offered to refill it and asked if we wanted specific kinds.   As per usual, I got the filet mignon cooked medium. (Everything a la cart. If you want sides you order it separately.) It was done perfectly, minimal seasoning where I can still taste the meat. I hate when places over season and you just taste the salt.   I had the intentions of getting dessert but not no room.   Pricing is same as other steakhouses in town.  The interior is very nice and looks very high class.",

I got there around 6:50pm on Sunday night and I was pretty excited since I made it for T-Bone Social Hour.   Sit at the bar area, Our server which I assumed her name was Shaheena. (Reading off my receipt) I think she might be new to the team which I was guessing from her customer engaged style.   Service was prompt but nothing to write home about. There are no up selling or suggested anything special as a side for my steak. I ordered 22oz Bone in Ribeye and Beef Carpaccio. I guess because when you sit at the bar all bartenders more used to just serve drinks more than food. I could be wrong. Maybe it was simply just Sunday and everyone just tired.   Waiting time was very short and satisfying.  When my food arrived, two gentlemen was kindly explained about their sauce which came with my steak. They were polite and professional.   At one point my glass of water left empty for about 4 minutes 10 second which should not be since I was sitting right there at the bar and at least three sexy bartenders roaming around in the bar area.   One thing I notice about all pretty staffs. I feel their might not be comfortable with their sexy style top because all of them kept adjusting to prevent the \"slip\" incident.   Food was good. At least one thing Impressed me was my server had mentioned if I would like my steak precut and that was awesome!!   At the end of my dinner. Other bartender came by and cleared the out all plates in front of me. She asked if I would like to see dessert menu but I said no. I paid and left... the end of story",

I have to admit this place is way better than all of the steakhouses I've tried on the strip. I also had the wedge salad which was delicious with ranch. The tuna tartare tacos are delicious too. I will always prefer the steak here over the steakhouses on the strip! The service was impeccable as well. Our bartender didn't push us to order a ton of food like other places.

She advised us that our booth would be available in a few minutes as it was being setup. Seating is available also in various size tables. I recommend a table or booth away from the entrance as the music can be heard due to the doors being left open.  Our server David and his associates provided top notch service. They were available at the appropriate time. David was also very knowledgeable of the menu and provided information to help make a decision.  The starter was a beautiful order of Big Eye Tuna Poke with Avocado, Wakame, Wasabi and Wonton Crisps. This order was large enough for two. The tuna was a picture perfect presentation that was almost to good to eat.    Our first entree was a Grass Fed 11 oz Bison Filet prepared medium rare. This was an outstanding piece of meat, tender, juicy and extremely lean. The side was an order of  grilled Asparagus in extra virgin olive oil. The asparagus spears were large and perfectly grilled.     Second entree Buttermilk Fried Chicken  Breasts, with Sage Gravy. Two large breasts with a crispy breading and moist juicy white meat. More than enough for a second meal. As a side it was all about the Mashed Potatoes with Roasted Garlic.  The finale was a complementary birthday dessert. A beautiful presentation of vanilla custard topped with berries and a chocolate covered strawberry. It tasted as good as it looked.  Although T Bones is a pricy dinner it is no more than places on the strip. The quality and service holds its own against all others in Las Vegas. It is also more convenient if you live on the northwest side of town.",

Each time we have had a comp that caused us to come in, each time we are blown away by the food and service and promise not to wait for a \"comp\" to bring us back!  This time, I really promise not to wait too long!  Excellent service - Attentive waiters, and assistant waiters, and sommelier's  that really know their stuff.    Top notch ingredients and a wine list of depth and breadth - 'nuff said.  Excellent food preparation and well thought out menu - something for everyone.   In our most recent visit we had the Hearts of Palm Salad.  BEST Hearts of Palm Salad we have had.  Anywhere.  EVER.  Hats off.  Also enjoyed the grass fed fillet, the bone in ribeye, and the mushrooms and garlic mashed.  All were made from the finest ingredients and well prepared.  Flavors of the beef and the textures and tenderness were outstanding.  Warning for those faint of heart - the garlic mashed is VERY garlicy.  I loved it, but surely some will find it overpowering if you don't love garlic.  If you are familiar with the SF Bay area, I consider this to be the \"Alexanders Steak House\" of Las Vegas.  The menu isn't as extravagant, and they don't have the dozens of the over-the-top pricey items that Alexanders has (thank goodness), but if you are going to go drop less than $300 on dinner and drinks for a couple, it shows very well against the highest end steakhouses.  While the prices are dear, they are a value compared to some of its Michelin rated peer steakhouses (ala Alexanders).",

She is good, good and LOUD!  The servers are having a difficult time hearing the customers and the customers have a difficult time carrying on a normal conversation.  Last time we were there a few weeks ago, I used earplugs.   We went to Red Rock on Thursday to eat at TBones, started in the door and quickly made a U Turn due to the high sound volume of the singer.  We ended up having a nice meal at the bar in Libre.  This was the same scenario as last week.  I'm sorry to say until the music sound level is dropped will be be dining elsewhere .

First we were seated in at best would be described as a noisy sports bar setting which was very loud since it was happy hour.  We were re-seated in another section of the restaurant which had a glass partition separating the bar.  Still very noisy with blaring cover music (not even the real artists) played throughout our meal.  So much for atmosphere!   First round of drinks was excellent as expected.  Second round was much lower quality, probably bar stock.   Food and service was excellent as always.   The lack of decorum seriously diminishes the experience.   Not the way T-Bones has been in the past.  As locals, we will probably seek alternative restaurants for special occasions and fine dining. T-Bones has lost it's way.",

It's really close to our house but unfortunately the food is just ok, and especially with the price, not really worth the time or expense. We said this the first time we went a year ago and thought maybe it changed. We wanted to try the tomahawk - 32oz for $120. They took our order and 15 minutes later can to tell us they were out. We would have left if it had been earlier - but what type of steak restaurant doesn't have rib eye which is what the tomahawk is with a bone. We ended up ordering the 42oz T-bone. We asked for it medium rare. We ate it and didn't complain. It was okay. It was $120 for okay. We did tell them they over cooked it, and the server checked the meat with a flashlight and offered something else but we declined. We were done and we didn't ask for any discount etc. we just knew we weren't going back.  The steakhouse salad for $12 was big enough to split and it was good. They have a good breadbasket. And at the end they give you tiny chocolates and key lime tarts. Compared to other steak restaurants nearby - I'd say the price is about 25% higher for the same. Service was good. The $25 discount was not even worth it since that ended up being the cost of the tip. It's too bad it's only OK for that price.",

So I asked for a new salad. I should just leave.   But I waited. Steak and mash potatoes came out. The potatoes were overly salty. U had to send them back. But the ribeye was just perfection!

But Burts review isn't about the free food (because it's not really free, it was earned by risking Burts hard earned money at  the tables).    This review is about the fantastic dinner Burt had last night.    Burt has been to T-Bones a few times and always had a pretty good meal, but last night was a perfect meal top to bottom.     Lump crab appetizer.  Awesome!  Burt might go back and just have 4 of these for dinner one night.    We split a filet and a lobster tail.  Both were prepared perfectly.  Dover Sole was excellent.  Au gratin potatoes and Aztec style grilled corn were very tasty.    Dessert Alert-  DEEP FRIED OREOS AND ICE CREAM!!!!!!!!  Hump Daaayyy, whoop whoop!  Last night was a 5 star, but because of the other 2 \"good\" meals Burt has to average it out to a 4 star.  Burt will be back and hopes the 5 star meals continue and may upgrade T-Bones rating in the future.",

Ronnie server assistant came by to go over menu but decision  was made.  Ordered steak salad to split, then filet for me and crab legs for her. Overall service was friendly and never over barring.  Food was good salad a little bland but steak tender and moist. Friend's crab legs good. The only negative would be dinning room was cold and not  comfortable although the server did bring a hot towel for hands to keep warm and did offer to move us near fireplace. Very happy with restaurant would visit again.",

I enjoyed them, even though I don't really like sea food.  We then shared the mixed green salad, which had avocado and bacon and was chopped. It was very delicious!  I got the filet and bf got the Rib eye. Both steaks were cooked and seasoned perfectly. I have to say, I thought his was more flavorful and up there with one of the best I have ever had. Shocking from me since I am a filet steak kind of girl. We did both get the Gorgonzola add-on as well to enhance flavor. Sides we got Au gratin potatoes and grilled asparagus. Both pretty good, but the Au-gratin could have had more flavor. Still enjoyable.  Desert we got the toffee cake, which was very good, but needed more ice cream. Server was Mike, very pleasant and attentive, as well as the busser. Obviously this place is very pricey, so Probably wont be coming here weekly (Although that would be awesome lol) But if you are looking to treat yourself or a date for a special occasion, you will not be disappointed with T-Bones. Our experience was just wonderful.",

I have been here with groups and we have not had any disappointment in the food (salads are incredible and big enough to share, great seafood apps, perfectly cooked steaks and adequate sides). The live music - not sure if they have it during the week - was also great.   Service was perfect; very attentive. Really the only downside is the prices are a bit inflated, even considering the food quality and service. Unless you made out well at the casino, it's an enjoyable splurge!",

The wife went with the bone in rib eye and loved it, I had the large filet and it was like butter.  My only criticism is that I'd like to have the option of a blue cheese or a horseradish crust.  We split the California Salad which was big enough for two and split a baked yam which was DELISH.  We split a piece of cheesecake which was so huge we couldn't finish it, it was light and creamy.

The attractive hostesses (this is Vegas, so no surprise) were both very friendly and welcoming (this WAS a surprise... because Vegas) and got us seated right away.  The food was quite good.  I mean, really, really good.  The portions were sized right, but we did make the mistake of ordering three of the sides after ordering salads and entrees.  There was simply too much for the three of us.  Try the tator tots and select the bacon/cheese role and pretzel breads of the choices offered.  You won't be disappointed!  The service staff was quite attentive and performed their roles well.  The corn side was too burnt for our tastes and the first glass of wine took awhile.  Regardless, highly recommend trying this restaurant if staying at the Red Rock.  If not staying, make a trip off the strip to enjoy the entire place.  Enjoy!",

The hostess disappeared before we sat down and my husband went back to the stand to request a booth (which we thought we had specified in the reservation). We stood by the table feeling very awkward and waited while other parties were being seated around us. We were finally escorted to a large booth in the bar area that was quite satisfactory. We ordered sparkling water which was delivered promptly and then were greeted by our first server who took our cocktail order. The martinis were delivered by the Asst. General Mgr, Jason, who apologized for the table mix up. Now, onto the food. We ordered the Bison Carpaccio and it was the BEST Carpaccio we've ever eaten! We then split the Bison Filet which was unbelievably velvety and flavorful. We would definitely come back for this alone!! We wanted a nice glass of wine to go with the Bison and asked for the Sommelier. Our second server suggested a tasting of a couple selections and we decided on the Nickel & Nickel. We were told they had to open a new bottle. The wine came and we enjoyed everything until I got towards the end of my glass of wine which was full of chunks of sediment. We were treated to several desserts (most notably the Guinness Sorbet!!) because of several mix ups (Seating, Regular Olives instead of Bleu Cheese Olives that were offered, sparkling water being refilled with flat water, chunks in the wine). Jason sat down and talked to us at length regarding our experience and the mix-ups. He apologized several times and truly wanted to make everything right and obviously wanted us to return. Overall, we enjoyed most of the evening and will definitely return. We highly recommend T-Bones if you are a Local, a Foodie, a Wine Enthusiast and looking for an upscale dining experience!",

Once  the bartender took my wine and food order, she did not once say another word to me the entire night and nobody came to check on me a single time.  The staff and manager talked amongst themselves the whole night.  I ordered my $50 bone-in ribeye steak rare and it came out medium rare plus.  The parts that were closer to rare were still pretty tough.  I only ate half of it, it was so bad.  Nobody asked me how my steak was cooked, and nobody was anywhere near me, so there was nobody to tell to make it right.  I had no beverage for most of the meal(once I finished the glass of wine) and nobody cared.  I drink a lot of water, but alas, not until my meal was over I had to snag a runner or bar back to grab me a glass of water.  The wedge salad was great, and the creamed spinach was passable.  This was such a poor, poor effort, I cannot believe the manager would allow such sloppy and terrible service.  Really really poorly done.",

Out of buffala mozz for the the caprese last night, this was re-imagined with heirloom tomatoes and whipped ricotta - perhaps was a better version than the standard on the printed menu.  T-bone for 2... i mean let's order what they *should* do best..after wretched carniveno experiences we ordered \"medium plus\".. this arrived perfect for us both to be happy. seasonal cauldron of vegg accompanied the t-bone for 2, though all very standard and okay - only the quartered roasted potatoes really stood out -- creamy like mashed on the inside and crispy roasted outside.  Sauteed spinach -- perfectly done, and still slightly under - love it!  mac&cheese -- good. it was good and no complaints which actually says a lot.  between the better than bread basket plus dessert - the celebration provided small tasting of creme brule and dipped strawberries....and double espressos of course, cause we need to be revived again....in all, it was good.   it was a surprise that service was really attentive without being overbearing. explanations though unnecessary were provided throughout the evening, but you can tell their usual patrons have below average grasp of food knowledge. they are serving plugra on the table, nice, but it isn't like it is an actual import or find farmed locally.   food was decent, and that seems to be a much more difficult find recently. including one of the few cheap-o bottles on the wine menu - $75 for penfolds cab; dinner for two just shy of $270 before tip... quite a feat i must say all things considered.",

    "text": "I was a little worried about going to T-Bones based on its mixed reviews.  Pros:  I like the atmosphere.  It's cozy and comfortable.  The service was decent and I didn't feel like we were overly watched or neglected.  Cons:  For the price of the food, there are simply much better steakhouses in town.  My salmon tasted like the salmon at Outback and cost $20 more.  The side dishes were just okay.    I don't think I would go back to T-Bones.  It was a one time experience and I prefer the food at Flemings, Del Friscos, and Mortons better.",

    "text": "There must be a secret handshake to get into the happy hour at Tbones, and we sure as heck didn't know it.   We arrived at 4 p.m. to find out when they opened the doors. The staff said the doors opened at 5 p.m. We hung out at Red Rock for an hour and went back at 5 p.m. on the nose to find the bar area completely packed. \"Oh, we opened at 4:45,\" said the same woman who told us the restaurant opened at 5.   I could certainly understand if we arrived at 5:15 to find the bar packed, but the moment they opened? And after we asked? Not cool.  If you do try to go to happy hour, stalk the front door from 4:30 on to get a seat. In the meantime, if you want my $5 coupons, they're yours. I won't be going back.",

    "text": "Great food, but a WARNING: From a dinner on Christmas Eve 2011: The steaks were excellent, the atmosphere was lovely, and the service was attentive. However, beware the champagne cart. The waitress managing that cart was informative about her selection, though not the prices (which were clearly displayed in the menu). However, she really pushed the Brut Rose. Then, when my daughter and each separately ordered the good but least expensive on the list (Imperial, I believe), she poured each of us a flute. But when the bill came, we learned that she had poured the Brut Rose for each of us, at $45 per glass rather than the $17 per glass that we had ordered. The other parties at our table clearly remembered us ordering the Imperial, but--as she commented--it was too late. BEWARE OF THIS SITUATION.",

    "text": "Born and raised las vegan, I know good steaks. This place has the usual steak house menu(ala carte) with the usual steak house prices(expensive). We got a bottle of stags leap blended red wine $85. Terrible choice! Ordered the bone in rib eye $49 medium cooked($10 at cosco). It came out crispy burnt on the outside(crunchy burnt BBQ style) and medium well on inside, after I cut out 25% of the fat. I would have rather made it at home, I would have cut all the fat off before I cooked it. Which is what most high end steak houses do. At least the carrot cake was top notch, and the service was ok. The hostess was beautiful and friendly. Which got them two stars instead of one.",

    "text": "The atmosphere is great.  I prefer eating at a table versus the bar. Have been here several times...the last time....was surprising a BIG disappointment.  I live right around the corner...and use this place as my go to steakhouse.   We had really poor service the last time at the bar.  Never again.  They had a UFC fight on the screens and they were completely bloody, while we were eating our food at the bar.  The female bartender said they had a contract and they couldn't turn the channel.  WOW!    She had a really bad attitude...would never sit in her section again.   Here the three of us had a three hundred dollar bill....and she couldn't change the channel while we were eating our dinner.   The scallops came out...they were a special and they were not seared.....yikes......42 a plate ....and not evened seared.  My two friends ate them anyways because they were invited and didn't want to be rude.  I spoke up later...and they said they had eaten too many of them to get them removed from our bill.  Really crazy...I don't know how this bartender keeps her job.   I will say this..........it was only one bad experience out of many.   But the restaurant when it comes to food is good. Pricey",

    "text": "Had a fabulous time at T-Bones last weekend. As self declared foodies, we have tried and critiqued our way through almost every fine dining restaurant on the Strip. For my boyfriend's birthday, we decided to branch out and dine at T-Bones in Summerlin (and enjoy an awesome staycation @ Red Rock!). The experience from start to finish was top notch.   The Steakhouse Salad is to die for...that dressing is amazing! I had the petite filet which was cooked perfectly. The BF had the Queen Cut Prime Rib (huge!) and the Lobster Chowder. We enjoyed the garlic mash and mac n' cheese as sides. Everything was SO delicious! We got talked into (it didn't take much) ordering deep fried oreos as dessert and WOW were those 2 lbs I gained worth it! Pricing was aligned with other steakhouses of this caliber in Las Vegas, but felt more worth it since there were no gimmicky themes and we didn't have to yell to hear each other.  Outstanding service by the entire waitstaff, but especially our main server Mike. He put up with my boyfriend's dad's jokes and made the evening extremely enjoyable.   We'll definitely be back!!",

It was empty when we came, so we had the server's full attention.  Great ambiance at a nice off-the-strip hotel.   From my favorite to least favorite here is what I ordered: Poke stack- great seaweed salad at the bottom Garlic mashed potatoes- I love garlic, this was nice and creamy Pretzel bread- nice variety of carbs before the meal Filet- nothing razzle dazzle, a good piece of meat drizzled with a white sauce Calamari- a little salty for my tastes, it was just ok",
