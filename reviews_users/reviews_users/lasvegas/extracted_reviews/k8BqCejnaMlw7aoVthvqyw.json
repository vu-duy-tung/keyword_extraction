    "text": "Visited last night and was very excited to experience the cocktails, since I've heard that it was a good place to visit for my birthday. Of course, I ordered a Negroni since it is a specialty at the place, but the results were disappointing at the end.   First of all when the bartender took our order she was not pleasant and did not mention any of the entertainment happening and she seemed very rushed but the night was pretty slow. When the drinks were served, the beer was pleasantly chilled but our specialty drink was not prepared well. We have tried many Negroni's in the past and this was not up to par at all.  The atmosphere was good but the bartenders and servers should be a little bit more aware of what they are serving as well as to be of service to the customer. Nice classic decoration throughout with pictures of old Vegas celebrities and a 50's feel. Even the restrooms are set up that way.",

I came to celebrate graduation, but you could come here for any occasion or any excuse for dinner!   Food was DELICIOUS! Very Italian, very cheesey & tomatoey (everything I love). But my mum also had great calamari! We had trouble with my friend's attempt at a vegan pizza (asked for vegetarian pizza w no cheese, came back with sausage, OOPS!) easy mistake and they were quick to fix it & offer compensation with a free desert.  Speaking of, their cannoli's are the only cannoli I have actually enjoyed, thank you for that!  Loved our waiter, Eddy. He made me feel special on my special night & was quick to take very good care of my table. Thank you, Eddy!  Definitely coming back for the atmosphere, music, sweet service, to try more delicious food, and for more cannoli's!!!",

I really wished I remember it sooner, or asked myself why I stopped coming here in the first place. Probably because I'm not really a fan of all the greasiness and carbs that Italian food is associated with. lol,  IDK. Anyway What I learned from the Italiano/a  that I know, is  a good Italian restaurant have to have good spaghetti & meatballs, if they cant get that right, it's not authentic.  So we order the calamari for appetizer, great marinara sauce. Spaghetti and meatballs, and spaghetti and sausages. ( Both amazingly great, you can taste the fresh ingredients) Every time i've been back, I want to try something new, but I just cant keep ordering the same, because it was that good. And they have live performers on certain nights, so will be back to eat, drink and chill in the future..",

    "text": "The is old school Vegas Italian restaurant. The night we were there, they had a piano player (the vocalist who was scheduled to perform never showed up by 6:30 when we were finished eating even though she was supposed to go on at 5:30). The Food: The food service starts with delicious hot bread on the table. It is accompanied by a red dipping sauce (don't remember what it was - just that it was very tasty). Very good and very easy to fill up on the bread if you are not careful. My wife and I decided to share the wedge salad to start. While I frequently get a wedge to start a meal, this had to be the biggest wedge I have ever seen. It was loaded with bacon pieces and lots of tomato with a good bleu cheese dressing. Very delish. Based on several of the reviews on Yelp, we decide to share the meat lasagna. The portion was huge - definitely dinner for two if you like to share. Lots of meat, lots of cheese. This was good but not great. We came to celebrate a birthday. Our waiter brought over a slice of delicious chocolate cake (see the photo - nice presentation). We also got an order of 3 cannolis (we were a party of 5 - one slice of cake wasn't going to make it around the table for a taste!). Also excellent. The Service: Our waiter came to the table almost immediately. Since we were first timers, he gave us some of the history of the restaurant and some recommendations on the food. The waiter, busboy and food runner were all very attentive. The food came out well timed. 5 star service. The Ambiance: We came in as a party of 5. They honored our reservation - a major plus in my book. As I said, the flavor of the restaurant is definitely \"Old Vegas\". The tables are very nicely spaced so you are not on top of the next table (there were some very long large tables in the main room that I assume were for large parties rather than strangers forced to dine together family style). Having a pianist playing background music was delightful.He was very good even without the vocalist). I really enjoyed my dining experience at Bootlegger and will definitely return. I was torn between giving a 4 star and a 5 star review but rounded down because of the missing vocalist and because the lasagna just didn't make the 5 star mark. But it was close.",

    "text": "Five stars for my entree! The first impression of the restaurant tells me we would be coming back each time we visit Vegas. I think the name did it too. Our friend's Uncle introduced this place. We came here for late lunch/early dinner, so the place was a bit quiet but it was great to have the restaurant all to ourselves and a few others. There's a Harp player entertained us on the stage, nice! It's a dim light place with cozy atmosphere, surrounded with maroon color. We were seated at the booth, very comfy! We ordered a seafood platter to start: calamari, shrimp, ravioli all together on a big plate. We also had a caesar salad to share. It seems like everywhere we go these days we can't help but ordering a caesar salad to start. Something we love to try in many places. So, for those restaurants that are out of caesar salad, you're out of luck! Anyway, after all that, hubby had his eggplant parmesan and I had my favorite spaghetti with clam sauce and I asked them to make me a spicy one with red sauce. My God! They listened! And they listened well! On top of their listening skills, they also made me the best mouthwatering red sauce that is out of this world. You gotta try this one if you love spaghetti red sauce with clam taste. Usually I would order seafood with red sauce but this one had major clam taste. They chopped those clams and also gave me enough clams on the shells, so my spaghetti was swimming with clam red sauce, killing the swimming team of the Olympic! OK, just order that. I'm a red sauce drinker! I mean eater! So, when a restaurant makes me red sauce for my spaghetti, I'm a bit picky because I taste many different red sauces all my life. This one was really good. The seafood platter was just OK but my entree was terrific! Cecilia was our waitress for that afternoon. Service was ok, no problem. One thing  to keep in mind, Uncle Bert ordered chicken parmesan but when it came out it was a sandwich parmesan which he didn't enjoy as much. I think would be best to inform the guest if there's 2 types of chicken parmesans, so that he knew which one to order. After our meals, we hit a jackpot with the plate of 3 desserts due to Uncle Bert's birthday. Cecilia did it good, she made Uncle Bert's happy. I tried it but didn't think I could handle more than my entree. It was the best experience plus great Harp musician. Definitely would come back. Five stars for my entree. The rest was OK but not bad. Make sure you put it on your next eating list! Btw, they open 24/7. You know where to go when you're hungry!",

Portions are huge and garlic knots with marinara sauce are complimentary and continuous.  Perfectly cooked pasta, home-made fresh sauce.  Decor is outdated, but it actually is part of the charm.",

It's quite fascinating.  Although the overall dining experience was exciting, the food didn't convince. Everything was soaked in oil and very heavy. The portion size could be called generous and the taste was OK, but nothing more than ordinary.   The major drawback, however, was the very limited assortment of vegetarian dishes - despite a very large menu. Even the Minestrone is cooked with a bacon broth and has sausage included. Amazingly, when I asked about the origin of the broth, the server claimed the Minestrone to be vegetarian because the bacon could be removed after the broth was cooked. To add insult to injury, there is almost nothing a vegan could order. I totally argue that a restaurant in this day and age (in the western world) should be inclusive and also cater to vegetarians and vegans.",

    "text": "Let's start with a little back ground information on myself and italian food. My Uncle's side of the family is full italian and can cook so I have had plenty of great authentic italian food over my lifetime. Bootleggers is the first italian restaurant, that I have been to, that produces great tasting, authentic, italian food.   This place really portrays old Vegas well. You feel like you just stepped back in time to when Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin ruled the Strip. This place is one of the coolest spots in Vegas. They even have a nice piano player and lounge singer on most nights and they are open 24/7.  Now for the food. They start by giving you their garlic bread rolls...or thats what I call them. They are freshly baked garlic bread that is cut into squares before baking, so they resemble a roll. The rolls are served some classic marinara sauce that give them a great taste, but don't fill up on the rolls because the portion sizes here are pretty big. I ordered the spagettig and meatballs and my wife got the chicken Fettuccini alfredo. A True test to any italian restaurant is their meatballs. Every italian restaurant I have been to has meatballs that taste like dog food and yes this includes the regualrs like Olive Garden and Buca de Beppo. Bootlegger's meatballs are fantastic. They taste very similar to my family's recipe and therefore made me feel like I was at home. The spagetti was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of great tasting sauce. My wife's meal came out great too.   The price of the meal was very resonable, with most entrees costing between 13-18 dollars. The service was average but acceptable. This place is a must visit not only for the food but for the great ambiance.",

My boyfriend made reservations Saturday April 1st we show up we're seated and our waiter was very nice took our drink order then food order the normal ya know! My bf runs to the restroom and while he's gone which wasn't long at all the food was delivered!!! Yes food before drinks???!!! Seriously Bootleggers??? Our waiter even made the comment as he brought the drinks he was very shocked our food was out! We had fettuccini alfredo with chicken which was not good at all. Who the hell puts pesto sauce all over the chicken for alfredo?!  I did not like it at all! We never got the bread so my man asked again and we got old hard gross bread! My drink was even bad compared to my mans drink! The only thing good was the lasagna! So I'm not sure I will ever be back. I should get a thank you for not calling out a manager!",

The only reason a star is missing is because the male hostess was not very friendly or welcoming.

The dress seemed casual but the place has a very classy vibe and made me feel under-dressed in my jeans.  The food is really pretty great - my dad wasn't as impressed with his lasagna but my dinner (Maria's Saltimbocca) was great!  They also had a piano player in the dining room who took requests - pretty awesome for the amount that we spent!",

    "text": "Classic Italian restaurant with great Italian food!  I've been here a couple of times, and recommended it for a recent Christmas dinner with friends as we all like Italian food and I remember the decor as just being classic Italian and with wonderful selections.  The food is also delicious (our last Italian place went downhill, and the one before that closed - so on the lookout for a new one - this is the place!).  As I stated, the decor is really great - old school Italian with reds and dark woods.  The service was also really good - my glass was never empty and they were very patient with my toddler and able were able to provide her with a cup of milk with lid and straw.  Some of the more expensive restaurants can't accommodate this, so I always bring a sippy cup just in case.    The food was phenomenal.  If you're looking for classic, great tasting Italian food, look no further.  Everything was tasty.  We first got a couple of platters of the Hot Mixed Antipasti of which I was able to snag a shrimp and calamari - both were really good, and the accompanying marinara sauce also had really good flavor.  For my entree I got Baked Penne (easy to share with a toddler), and my husband got the Pork Chop Marsala - both dishes were really good.  My husband really would have preferred Chicken Marsala, but this was a good substitute.  The Baked Penne was also really good, and I had to stop myself from overeating!    They also served bread with olive oil - my little girl gobbled that up!  As did everyone else at the table.  Overall, a great experience - would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good Italian dinner.  Place was also great for a large party - they provided a table with plenty of room for everyone.  I've been here too with just a friend, and they have wonderfully private booths.",

    "text": "I didn't know where to take my stepdad for dinner and saw this little Italian Restaurant.  I was expecting a restaurant but after entering the door, there was a bar with TV and was almost confused.  Part of the restaurant looked very elegant, from the tables and chairs, and decor looking like it came from the Queens dining room.  But then part of the restaurant had a English pub feeling to it.  Another hiccup I had was the very dim lighting in the restaurant.  My stepdad had to complain to me about how he couldn't read his menu.  It could be his old age or I might have to agree that the lighting was the problem.  We sat down and since we were only looking to eat light, ordered salads.  My stepdad ordered the Iceberg Wedge.  It had, as per the menu, \"Wedge of iceberg lettuce, crispy pancetta, scallion, chopped egg, tomato concasse topped with Maria's bleu cheese dressing.  I ordered Isalata di Casa.  It's prepared, as per the menu, Endive Saald with candied walnuts, gorgonza chees, shaved pear, tossed in house vinaigrette dressing.  After we got our salads, my stepdad looked at his and looked at mine.  He looked a little disappointed and as a good daughter, I suggested we switched.  It was a little hard to part ways with my Insalata Indivia because it looked amazing.  But I wanted to make sure my stepdad had a good time.  Tasting the Iceberg Wedge, I  regretted swapping my salad instead of asking the waiter to change my order to the Insalata Indivia.  Maria's bleu cheese dressing combined with all the other ingredients was just too rich and too much to handle.  I almost wanted to throw it in the trash if there was one next to me.  There was just too much going on with the salad.  Luckily, I was able to taste the Insalata Indivia and was very impressed with it.  The colors and the flavors combined were perfect.  It was simple and was perfect for my pallet.",

    "text": "THE BEST ITALIAN IN LAS VEGAS!!!  Living in Vegas for the past 17 years of my life and having the opportunity to sample some of the finest Italian Food Las Vegas has to offer, I can definitively say that Bootlegger is number 1!  I've been to this place more times than I can count, and it never ceases to amaze me after each and every visit! I prefer to sit in the lounge area near the bar, as it's more quiet than the main dining area, especially when the restaurant has live performers livening up the atmosphere with music.   My favorite appetizer is the calamari, and entree has to be the linguini and clams! The calamari is cooked to perfection on every visit, and the portion size for the linguini and clams is unreal. I personally prefer the broth, but the other sauces are delicious as well! The pasta is usually good to serve two people, but I can eat an entire bowl by myself because it's THAT GOOD! If you're not into linguini and clams, I can honestly say I've never gone wrong with anything else on Bootlegger's menu, so take your pick!  If you managed to save room for dessert, the Tiramisu is where it's at! Probably the best Tiramisu in Vegas at the time of writing this review, but that's been at the top for years now.   Overall, Bootlegger is fantastic! It's a perfect place to visit for any occasion! I would recommend avoiding Bootlegger on Friday and Saturday night for dinner, as it can get quite crowded. Go during the week at around 4:30PM and you'll practically have the place to yourself. You might have to wait a little before the food comes to your table, but that's because Bootlegger makes everything from scratch!   Once you go Bootlegger, you'll be spoiled for life!",

As we walked to the table i noticed a table for four had a chair added to the end and as we were three large adults with a teen and my eight year old i asked for a larger table to accommodate the size of the group. i was told \"no\" because we didn't have reservations. Let me show you a picture of the place at the end of our meal-plenty of empty tables still that could have made my meal enjoyable instead of cramped. Since Pappy sat on the end (grown man) i was not able to sit close to the table because i also have legs so i was forced to eat from a few feet away but it's red sauce and you can't eat it that way unless you want to wear it. When my back would cramp from being hunched towards the table i would pick up my plate to move it closer to my face so as not to make a mess. I hate being crowded, especially when the meal isn't cheap. I will not return no matter how many times the family requests a meal at the Bootlegger.",

    "text": "This is a review of the night I went to see Santa Fe and the Fat City Horns at the Bootlegger nightclub space.   Well, I hope you're not looking to have a cocktail or you have to use the restroom or you have a bad back.  1. We were seated on long tables with a railing behind us. We would have to literally crawl over people to get up to use the restroom, which thankfully we did not need to until the end of the show. The reason for this is below.  2. If I wanted to actually see the stage, I had to either turn my chair so that my back was facing the person I came with, or I had to turn my neck more than a 45 degree angle to even see the stage. Note, not every seat is like this.  3. There was a sign on the table that there was a two drink minimum. Fine, that's great, I'm in the mood for some cocktails and great music! Think again. I watched the entire section in front of the stage get excellent service from a cocktail waitress. About halfway through the show, I finally flagged her down and asked if we could have drinks. She rudely told me she would send over our server, instead of just helping us herself. A heavily tattooed young man came over and gave us our drinks. He vanished for the rest of the evening. Literally the last song he gave us our check. We would have liked more cocktails! But the other waitress wouldn't help us, and literally we could not get up and go to the bar.  The music was great, I would happily pay the cover and have lots of drinks, but nope, never coming back.",

(and this place is open 24/seven, so you can get your Italian food fix anytime you want!)  Brittany was awesome in assisting me with deciphering the menu. Determined that the chicken marsala was in order, so I ordered that up. Came with a side of fettuccine Alfredo (delicious). I know you can drink marsala wine but seriously, if they would bottle this chicken marsala sauce I would drink it out of a glass or a cup or a shoe or whatever!  But the real winner in this whole breakfast/lunch/dinner was the bread basket. Think of little pillows of dough that are brought out to the table with marinara sauce... they was fantastic!

The restaurant itself is dark with a bit of an old school decor. Huge bar area separate from the main dining room. I loved all the old photos, of whom I assume are all family members. There's a piano in the main dining room but we were too early for the live music.   Loved the garlic bread and sauce to start. I ate wayyyy too much of it and they happily brought us more. We chose the cheese ravioli and lasagna, both of which were delicious and tasted homemade and not frozen. Enjoyed the house salad, and had a delicious lava cake for dessert.   I did mention my husband's birthday on the reservation and no one acknowledged it, but they did give us the dessert for free - it was taken off the check as \"Birthday dessert.\" I feel like fewer places are doing that these days.   They have what seems like great specials between 3 and 5 daily. They include a salad, lighter fare portion, and dessert, I think (not to mention that delicious bread) for $19.

The atmosphere was nice, dimly lit, some dressed up and others went in jeans. There's a pianist playing as well and he sounds dang close to frank Sinatra!  The service there was outstanding! They took our drink orders and orders quickly and the meals were prepared in a timely manner. The portions of the food were great too, I got a pasta dish with clams and it was enough to feed 2 people. Food was delicious!!! It was hot but not enough to burn you and the amount of clams they placed on my plate was plenty! They also start you off with garlic squares and a marinara dip as well. I didn't care too much for the dip because I couldn't get the tomatoes on there, it was more like you had to scoop out the pieces on your garlic square.  The reason why I'm giving this place a 5 star is because of the service. The waiter was great but I have to commend the runner that tended to our table. This gentleman was working his buns off from one table to another and was constantly helping others as well. He refilled our drinks quickly and was asking what else we needed. I didn't get a chance to catch his name but he was great and for that reason, the restaurant earned another star.",

    "text": "Whenever my family is in town we usually go to Casa Di Amore, but on their last visit we made the drive to Bootlegger and it was amazing. It's a huge space which allows you to choose which kind of vibe you're looking for. If you want an intimate experience with live piano, sit in the dining room. If you'd prefer to keep it casual, sit in the booths at the bar. This is just a cool place to be. Probably even cooler the later in the night you stop by.   We started off with some drinks and an order of the braised pork neck bones. This was delicious but took us by surprise. The pork was super tender and the broth seemed vinegar based, reminding me of sauerkraut. It's such an unusual taste but you get kind of addicted to it. It should be noted that panetti breads (sort of like garlic knots) are provided with the meal so you could get away with not having an appetizer. For dinner I ordered the papperdelle bolognese, my boyfriend had the baked penne, and.. I can't even remember what my parents ordered. Probably because the star of the show was definitely the papperdelle bolognese. I mean how perfect of a noodle is papperdelle? To me, the thicker the noodle the better. Perfect for soaking up the meaty, slightly greasy bolognese sauce. I don't do Italian food all that often but this is probably the only dish in Vegas that I dream of having again.  The portions are pretty big, especially after eating the panetti breads and any other drinks or appetizers that come beforehand.   The Bootlegger is somewhere probably everyone has seen driving down Las Vegas Blvd near the Outlet mall. It looks so large ominous that you would never think it would be as intimate as it is inside. It's the kind of place you want to keep to yourself or sneak into after a long night at work. It's certainly a lot more welcoming and cozy than any stuffy Italian restaurant on the Strip. Highly recommended!",

We both orders salads and my sons salad has more oil on it then a jiffy Lube. To their credit they did remove it from the check. I ordered the cucumber, tomato and grilled chicken. Nice salad a little heavy on the dressing as well, but one thing that it didn't have was the chicken? A grilled chicken salad minus the chicken. They did bring out a nice breast but the whole experience was enough to make me a believer. Will be interesting if I hear anything back but we shall see. Bottom line don't go to an Italian place and eat salad.",

Wish I hadn't.  We were sitting at our table for 10 min before someone came to greet us. I ordered the chicken parm which was good. Too much cheese for me but the marinara sauce was great.My boyfriend ordered a Marsala and Alfredo combo and hated the Marsala sauce. We rarely complain about food but he has had Marsala before and this wasn't what he was expecting. The server took his food to the kitchen and came back another 10 min later and handed me his plate saying theres nothing she can do because theres nothing wrong with it. What?! After his dish was analyzed with fingers and forks they expect us to eat this and pay for it!? I work in the industry and was pretty appalled by this. I asked to talk to the manager who never came. Instead, the server came back and magically found a way to take the Marsala off our bill and then ignored us for the duration of our dinner.   The food isn't worth the aggravation.  2 stars solely for the piano player.",

    "text": "I'm sure there's amazing things on their menu. However, when I try a new place, and see that they have Philly cheesesteaks on their menu, I try that, as a barometer.   I mistakenly asked my waitress how it compares to my favorite Philly in Las Vegas before I ordered it. She said, \"[other restaurant] is shit, this is way better.\" Customer service tip - when someone mentions their favorite place, and you tell them it's shit, you A) had better be prepared to back that up with a quality sandwich, and B) know them pretty well, since a lot of people are unaccustomed to that type of treatment in restaurants.   I had the Philly cheesesteak equivalent of the McRib, my co-worker had the most uninspiring spaghetti and some sort of sausage (but made fresh, onsite, daily!) that made him wonder if he had actually eaten anything. The waitress came back to ask how much better it was than my favorite restaurant. I told her it wasn't. I didn't mention the whole McRib part of it, just that it wasn't better than [redacted]. She said, \"Well, when you're used to eating shit, I guess you get to like shit.\"   Customer service tip number two: Do not call your customers coprophages unless you have actually observed them eating shit.   Seriously, with unemployment as high as it is, do restaurants REALLY have to scrape the bottom of the barrel for employees like this?",

I've been here every time I visit Vegas and I've never been disappointed. My brother's wedding reception was also here and they still had stellar service. They are just south of the airport on Las Vegas Blvd, maybe 10 minutes from the strip if you hit traffic.  You sit down and before the second butt-cheek hits the chair, your bread is on the table. Very soon after that your water. I've had several different entrees there and every single one of them have been great! I love their breakfasts too.... especially at 2pm. LOL Their service is exceptional. Their food is always wonderful and I've managed to hook my family on this place too.  I was particularly impressed when they hosted my brother's wedding reception. Even though there was a selection of pre-determined items to choose from, because I'm vegetarian and not a fan of alfredo (thanks to my meat eating brother, this was the only veggie meal in his selection), they had no problem offering me something else and offering it to other people as a selection as well. I loved this. The only complaint I had, as my brother's photographer, was that the lighting was so dim, the pictures were hard to take.  The only thing I haven't had here is dessert. I'm going to have to change that.",

Our service was excellent!!  Our waiter could not have been better and the water glasses were kept full.  When I asked about a certain wine, the waiter said he didn't care for that one and offered me what he thought was a better wine.  It was a lovely wine indeed!  The calamari was lightly breaded and came our hot with marinara sauce that was tasty and hot.  It was a large appetizer for just two people.  the Caesar salad were crisp and flavorful.  My husband had chicken masala with fettuccini Alfredo.  VERY tender and wonderful.  I had the pork chop which was on the bone and a huge meal.  The scalloped potatoes were wonderful.  Just before 6:00 a pianist showed up and played some lovely music.  Everyone that came from then on out wanted to be close to the music.    We had a terrific time and will go back again.",

The restaurant itself looked like something out of a movie -- an old school Italian-American restaurant set in New Orleans or Old Vegas on Halloween night.   Quaint yet sizable with a cozy darkish ambiance, this would be a great restaurant to take a date! Or friends! Or family! Or anyone you want to have a good time with!  The little bread rolls they served were cute and delicious -- small curled up snail-like rolls drenched in olive oil and peppered with \"Italian seasoning\" (my palate isn't sensitive enough to distinguish the elements). I ordered spaghetti with the red meat sauce. My dining companion had fettucine alfredo with shrimp. The portions were generous and the food was FLAVORFUL + super satisfying in a home-cooked sorta way. I was in heaven! My fellow diner was enjoying his meal too. The fettucine alfredo was delicious! Tastebud nirvana!  I will definitely return and order the same thing next time. The spaghetti with red meat sauce was too good!  Ps: The staff and service were impeccable! This place was a sweet find. :)",

Osso Buco and saltimbucco....calamari and the veal marsala...all very good.  My wife thought the accompanying alfredo was the best she'd ever had.   Second night, water was Vito, also excellent.  And again, all four meals were excellent.  I asked for pomodoro instead of the alfredo side and that was disappointing - tomatos were canned and I could't taste or see the garlic.  But as a side dish, that sure did not ruin the evening at all. We didn't get to try a dessert - too full both nights.  And the Thursday visit included a piano plyer with \"lounge\" type music.  Far from the best - real far. So we've got a new go-to in Vegas.  And it was extra nice to get off the strip (about 3 miles south of Mandalay Bay).  Oh, they're open 24/7!!!!",

    "text": "My two friends and I ate here about 10 days ago. We were anticipating some amazing old school Italian food, as we are big Anthony Bourdain fans and if Anthony Bourdain featured this restaurant on his show, we figured we were sure to have some sort of sublime tastebud experiences.  When we walked in, the hostess gave us a chilly look and said, \"Do you have a reservation?\" in a snotty voice. To which we responded, \"No.\" She acted annoyed, even though the place was about 1/2 full, if that. And come on, honey, it's a Monday night, and it's Nevada. Whatever. The waiter was similarly standoffish, but warmer than the hostess. I ordered the primavera. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper, and it was still pretty bland. I figured since I ordered a vegetarian dish, maybe I'd ordered the wrong thing. But my other buddy had the meat lasagne, which, seriously, is a dish that's tasty at 80% of all Italian restaurants one would eat at. Not so much with his. He barely finished it, and he usually eats like a horse. Food was not disgusting, just ok. Again, may I say bland? Unimpressive? Weak? I actually didn't see the episode where Anthony Bourdain ate here. I will lose the respect I have for him if he ate here and said, \"That's good.\"  Bootlegger: That's not good.",

    "text": "A customer of mine recommended Bootlegger's to me when I first moved to Vegas a few months ago, and this place is a winner. It's amazing to me that this place is opened 24/7. They also have live music I believe around 9PM which adds to the ambiance. I'd say it has a very classic Italian feel with dim lighting, candlelight, & professional waiters.  But the important part is the food. I've been here I'd say 3-4 times now, and have ordered something different every time, and I have liked everything. the dinner salads are huge, the chicken piccata is delicious, spaghetti and meatballs a safe and yummy choice. My in-laws ordered the baked penne, and bolognese, both delish. The bread with marinera before your meal is great, warm and always tasty. The only gripe is the desserts we ordered were just ok. Good not great. The cannoli's had a citrusy flavor, and chocolate chips, which to us was just a tad odd tasting. FYI, the bar has video poker, if you like playing while you drink. All in all, this is a great Italian restaurant, the staff is always attentive and the food delicious. We will be back for more!",

It is beautiful inside & our waiter was really nice. The food and bread is delicious. I ordered the sausage, potato and pepper dish & my husband had steak, mash potatoes and a prawn. The servings are large so of course we had left overs, which they contained & bagged for us. I didn't open my left overs until I got to work the next morning & I found a medium length blonde hair buried in my food as I was eating! I thought maybe I was seeing things and maybe it was plastic but nope! It was blonde hair with a dark root and a bulb on it! Our waitress looked like a natural blonde male so maybe it wasn't him when he packed our food (which was done away from the table) so maybe it was someone in the kitchen. Unfortunately that ruined my experience because I would've came back, esp since we live down the street.",

The place has a local vibe and is not on the Strip, though it is on Las Vegas Blvd. The place has a long-term local roots in Vegas as it was once owned by the owner of Lorraine's, a famous Las Vegas restaurant back in the day.   The service was fantastic. They didn't rush, got everything right, and we never had an empty glass. The server had a good sense of humor and was patient with us taking forever to order and eat- we were never rushed.   The food was a mild Italian. Not at all spicy. Sauce was not sugary or acidic. It was perfect. The portions were not insanely huge like some Italian restaurants and I mean that in a good way. Bread was fabulous. Everyone loved their meal and we ranged from manicotti to mussels.  There was a lounge singer and a piano player but it was not super loud. It had a real Old Vegas vibe without going to Old Vegas and dealing with the downsides of that area. Tons of parking, too.",

To be more specific, truffle chicken carbonara and cheesy garlic bread were the two items I wished magically appeared on every menu late night.   Well, that's hopeful wishing. To even find an Italian restaurant open at midnight is another struggle. We came across bootleggers through yelp! Open 24/7?! Sold! Although No cheesy garlic bread and no truffle chicken carbonara...So I settled with chicken Alfredo and complimentary garlic knots.   Alfredo was pretty good! I wish it was more saucey! Please don't be shy on that Alfredo juice, no one ever complained about their pasta being too saucey, and if they did, they're a fool. Garlic knots tasted stale. But who cares. You can't complain about free stuff. That's just begging and choosing. So of course we ate it all!! Happily.....   Environment wasn't rude but it wasn't friendly. Our server did his job, and made sure we got everything we needed and at an appropriate time. Very straight shoot \"get you in, get you out\" type of service. I wasn't upset about it.   Soooo Long story short, that's how I felt about bootleggers Italian food at midnight. I craved. I came. I ate. I left. Wish I could say more than this but it's all I got for now",

Our server was very prompt and brought us complimentary garlic bread balls with marinara sauce. The menu is a little pricey but if seated in the restaurant area with music (on select days), it would probably make up for the steep pricing.  I'm vegan so I asked our server what he would recommend. One of his suggestions was the \"capellini al pomodoro rustica\" and stated it's usually made with chicken stock but he would request it made without. Perfect! The meal was delicious and I was pleased with a yummy variety of veggies cooked very nicely with sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil with some noodles (linguine, I believe).   My date ordered chicken parmesan which came with angel hair pasta and most everything was covered with cheese. Perfect for him! He enjoyed his meal as well. Service was very good and our server was personable. I really appreciated the attention and ease toward my dietary request!  Improvements could be made with a separate page for vegetarian or vegan options. We always appreciate being able to order from a menu without a worry that there will be hidden ingredients. Otherwise, awesome meal!",

Decor plays a big part for me, but let me just tell you, the food did not disappoint.   Ambience--for me, was a little dark but other than that, I have no complaints. Although I was not a fan of the decor too much, I truly only care about whether or not the food tastes good. My advice here is, don't be put off by the \"lone\" location of this place or the dark interior.  Service--was good. Our server was polite, prompt, and had a great memory. He took our orders without a notepad and remembered what each person ordered by memory--a skill you don't see anymore with servers. As the daughter of parents that have worked a lifetime in the food service industry, this is an old skill that I admire and appreciated.  Food--delicious. They do give you free bread as a starter and this restaurant does something unique I haven't seen yet--they give you the bread in \"bite size\" pieces and a side of their marinara sauce to dip it in. The sauce is good--tomato-y and garlic-y, just the way I like it. If you don't like marinara, you probably won't like this sauce. The bread is decently good. I got the Pappardelle (imported egg pasta with their bolognese meat sauce) and it was delicious. A little salty for me, but nothing that off put me from the dish overall. My wife and my in laws all got different dishes and said that flavors were good all around the table. The chicken fettucini alfredo is good--lots of chicken comes with it just a heads up!  Overall, a great experience and great food. Would come back!",

The Restaurant has been in business for over 50 years and has been staying True to the Matriarch's recipes, which separate the Bootlegger from their competition.   The site is also well appointed with red leather booths, an attractive dining-room and a full service bar. They also had a harp player who made the dinning experience that much more rewarding.   As for the food, we stared with the Classical antipasto which was absolutely amazing.  The portion was extremely generous and included fine Italian cheeses, multiple salami's olives and much more (see picture). For the main course we had the spaghetti with meatballs and a Chicken entree with artichokes, sausages and hot peppers which was a special request on my part, which they gladly accommodated. All dishes were well presented and prepared and were exactly what we expected; Great authentic Italian food!  The service was also top notch, as our waiter Scott, was on his A game the whole evening.  So if you enjoy authentic Italian fare, a romantic dinner, great service and a fair price point, the Bootlegger is a MUST!",

One day goes by without a call and I call back.  \"Oh Steve's not in so you'll have to try again later.\"  And I call back.  At which point they put me on hold for a while, picking up the phone a few times to see who I was (where I explained again that I was waiting to see if we could make a reservation) before finally someone slammed the phone on me.  Annnd nobody ever called me back.  So the food may be good, but I won't know.  Sounds like if you're a small group you might be fine but don't try as a large group.

There is a wonderful menu with go to classic Italian styles. I've had the Caprese Salad, garlic knots, and Spaghetti Classici which comes with either Sausage, Meatball, or Meat Sauce. (Insider tip: you can combine all three topping choices, and you absolutely should.)  The live music is perfect. And it is not too loud to wear you can't here the people you're with. I've heard a few different performers on Monday nights and the talent alone is worth the visit.  The bar service is also top notch.

I got the pancetta carbonara with peas! So fresh and really delicious. My friend got The piccata and she loved it. And  my other friend got the veal. Veal was tender the side spaghetti was lackluster and the sauce was a little to sweet. Overall a fantastic meal.",

    "text": "We wanted to try someplace different for my birthday this year and my friend suggested Bootlegger!  My husband made reservations ahead but since we hit the early dinner time (3pm - 5pm) we almost had the place to ourselves until we left and then it got very busy!   Total thumbs up here!!  Our server (I believe Scott was his name) was very attentive and friendly and couldn't do enough for us!   Salads came with our meal and mini garlic breads on the table with a marinara dipping sauce.   My husband enjoyed his orange roughy fish with side of fettucini and I loved my eggplant parm that came with angel hair pasta.   Scott surprised us with a cannoli (with a candle for my birthday) to share and we ordered coffees and our dinner was complete.  SO happy we gave this place a try !They  hit it out of the park in food, service and reasonable prices for Vegas --we live next town over and will be back!  Thank you guys!",

    "text": "I have been going to Bootlegger for many years now. In fact, whenever I visit Vegas, I always make a point to have lunch or dinner at Bootlegger.   Thursday night, my family and I decided on Bootlegger for an early dinner before going to see \"O\" at Bellagio. I made a reservation for 5 p.m., but we rolled in about 4:15. We were seated in the main dining room and there was an older gentleman playing piano. In case you don't know, Bootlegger has live entertainment just about every night.  And I will tell you that based upon dining at Bootlegger for probably 17 years or more, you never know who is going to get up and sing, or play piano. Another thing that makes this place so unique is that the wait staff has been here FOREVER. I think since God was a boy in all honesty. Lol   The menu is a book. There are specials for various times of day and there is something for everyone. My go too items are the Escargot. Bootlegger does a really good job with it. They are broiled in mushroom caps in an herb butter sauce. There is also the wedge salad which is one of the best anywhere. For my main entree, I had the Cabaribiti ala Carbanara. (Not sure on the spelling) It consisted of thick spaghetti like pasta in a cream sauce with peas and smoked bacon. It was sooo rich and and had a nice smiley flavor to it.  Bootlegger is still pretty much a locals place. I am thinking it might stay that way because it is so far down The Strip. Although, it is right next to the outlet mall, so ladies, you can leave your husbands or significant others at the bar and go shopping without them. Lol If you want a place with that old school Vegas vibe, check out Bootlegger.",

    "text": "Four of us met for late breakfast/early lunch items.  We ordered:  Eggplant Benny French toast House stack pancakes Fried ravioli with marinara Lasagna Basilico pizza with artichoke Panetti breads and marinara Cannoli  I used to go to the Bootlegger as a tourist when it was at its previous location of Trop and Eastern.  This was the second time I've been to this location.  Meeting at 10:30 so we could try some breakfast items before breakfast service starts, the best of the three items we tried was the eggplant Benny.  This was a unique take on eggs Benedict with the base being eggplant.  I am not a big pancake person but I did try some of this and found it to be light and of good flavor especially with the imported (from the Northeast) pure maple syrup one of the group carries with them for breakfasts just in case a place serves syrup made by someone's aunt.  Of the lunch dishes we ordered, the ravioli were very good.  The menu says it's a light breading and it was.  The pizza with artichoke was adequate.  The crust was not crisp but this is their style.  For dessert, the cannoli were standard except for the fact that they had and orange zest flavor to the filling which unusual to find at most Italian restaurants.  It gave a fresh taste to some rather standard, crispy shell cannoli.  The panetti breads with marinara was a bit of a disappointment for me.  They were too doughy for my taste.  This is a solid place for either breakfast or lunch although I'd go for lunch more than the breakfast selections.  It's a 24 hour place with video poker at the bar and it's a step up from the normal 24 hour places that dot the Las Vegas Valley.",

    "text": "We decided to go to Happy Hour because we saw on multiple places they have a five different foods on Happy Hour. We get there, and sit at a little table right in the bar area and were told HH is only at the bar. I am literally, 3 feet from the bar and my left arm wingspan can touch it. Okay, no big deal. We move to the bar order some drinks. The bartender gives us two regular menus and two, \"VIP Gaming menus\" and nothing is showing their HH pricing. We asked what was on HH and instead of five different foods, it was only three   Wings, fingers and mozzarella sticks. Okay. While looking over the menu we notice we have two different menus so we ask which was the right one and she didn't even know, lol. So we decided to order the sliders and a few other things and then she tells us they no longer have those. (we now know which one the right menu is.) We end up ordering the chicken wings and fries with a side of mozzarella sticks.   I have had a company dinner here numerous times and it wasn't bad, although Ventano's is 100x better. These wings, fries and mozzarella sticks were awful. They legit tasted exactly like the shit from Jack in the Box. It's sad that I know what those taste like but when I go to JITB I know what to expect. I expected a lot more from a well known restaurant like Bootlegger. I am sure they went to the frozen food section at Smith's, grabbed a couple of items to put on their happy hour menu, threw them in a fryer and called it good. It was pathetic and I assure you we won't be going back.",

Second, they give you complimentary bread, but we had to ask for it. Just put me off after going to an Italian restaurant where the service was so good--this is important when dining out.   Maybe they had an off night, I don't know, but given the other choices I have, I'd most likely go elsewhere.",

    "text": "One of my friends raved about this place the last time she came to Vegas so we decided we had to check it out. However, we were a bit skeptical because how can a fancy Italian restaurant be open 24/7? Well, it's True ladies and gents.   One thing to note is that this place gets very busy on any given day so it's important to get reservations ahead of time (unless you're going at odd hours of the night).   For starters, they brought amazing garlic bread bites to the table with a side of marinara sauce. Needless to say, our waiter had to bring us another batch since we finished our bread so quickly. For the main dish, I ordered chicken marsala which was very flavorful with the sauce and mushrooms. It also came with a side of creamy alfredo pasta. The portions are rather large so I shared with one of my friends.   Also, I ordered a creme brulee for dessert, which definitely was the icing on the cake. It had a crispy, sugary outside, with a creamy, rich inside. Words cannot explain how much I loved this dessert.   All in all, the service was amazing. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. The prices are a bit pricey (but what do you expect at a high end Italian restaurant, and when in Vegas...) This place definitely lived up to the hype. Definitely make sure to stop by during your Vegas trip!",

I couldn't understand what happened to the big portion, enough for 2 days and 2 people size lasagna everyone is raving about. I guess Slater thought we wouldn't notice and didn't I tell him we were hungry? (See photo) the description was meat lasagna with meat sauce and there was noting of the sort. I think there was ground sausage and mostly bread crumbs the meat sauce was straight up marinara. As a matter of fact, I thought he brought as the veggie lasagna and verified with Slater that it was in fact their \"Meat\" lasagna. I think they also forgot the lasagna noodles and tried to cover it up with a huge slice of mozzarella that encased the entire 2 inch by 2 inch piece of Lasagna. The deficient piece of lasagna looked more like a large one side ravioli with a huge piece of government cheese on top. The sausage & peppers sandwich was an assemble of 2 pieces of crunchy peppers ( 1 piece red & 1 piece green at one end of the sandwich and caramelized cold onions at the other end. They didn't even bother to throw the 2 in a pan to hear and combine then with the marinara sauce before putting them in the roll. The marinara sauce on the side? Nothing on the bread roll and barely toasted. Did I say I was on a diet?  Atmosphere is clean and fresh smelling. I would expect some garlic wafting out of the kitchen especially since there are  many large family posters everywhere. Not my mommas house.",

    "text": "I love this place. Food as always was spectacular, but the service lacked just a little bit. Our server was very friendly and a good kid, but just didn't quite perform to my expectations. We walked in and were seated in the dining area by the bar, which is just fine, but he took a good 4-5 minutes before stopping by with waters and to take our drink/appetizer orders. He was very apologetic which is nice, but the place wasn't horribly busy and I needed me some aqua. The food runner brought us the amazing garlic knots and yummy marinara dipping sauce, and our server took our order and we enjoyed some nice conversation. It was a great ending to a good weekend.   Our food arrived and I was salivating by this time, even after we destroyed two plates of the garlic knots. I ordered Chicken Piccata, which was pretty solid, but not the best I've had. My lady had the baked penne and she said it was very delicious as always, and her dad had the chicken Marsala. He's an excellent chef/caterer having owned AND cooked in at least 3 different restaurants in his day and he could not stop talking about how impressed he was with the \"high quality Marsala wine\" they used in the preparation of his meal. He said it's one of the best he's ever had, and that's saying something. Something that was a little annoying, is the water glasses are very small, and I drink lots of water with my meals. It ran empty for at least a couple minutes 3 times during the meal. It would be nice to get some bigger glasses, or maybe he could keep just a little better eye on his tables. Not a huge deal, but when you're eating steaming hot Italian food, sometimes you just need some damn water a little quicker.  The reason my review isn't 5 stars is the slight lack of service, and my piccata just being pretty good and not \"as good as it gets\" like 5 stars says. I'm a big fan, and will definitely come back as it's always a solid place for some great Italian food, and I love the atmosphere, and it's close to home. 4 really solid stars, probably closer to 4.5.

Not being total jerks, we paid the bill, settling it in our minds as some misunderstanding.  Their answer when we finally got a human on the phone (5 days later) - \"it was in your 'contract\"' - not a sheet of which either of us ever saw... what contract??!!??  Neither of us signed a thing!   So, we end up paying this HUGE bill of ... and paying for JUVENILES to drink 3+ alcoholic beverages no less!  What 7year old has 3+ alcoholic drinks?!?!?

I make it a point to go every time I visit Las Vegas, and no matter what I order, I am never disappointed.  The service is friendly, and the ambiance is very old school sin city.

He directed us to our server who could answer all our questions. Our server was not familiar with the menu and informed us that he had \"only\" been working there a few months. I'm sorry, but in a few months, he can learn about the menu. He did not attempt once to find an answer to our questions and basically just said \"I don't know\" and left it at that. He wasn't too thrilled about serving us. I had the eggplant frit which had no flavor. The pancakes were far from fluffy soft and hot which I think pancakes are supposed to be. The mozzarella sticks were decent. The complimentary garlic knots had a good flavor but by the hard and chewy texture, I would guess they weren't fresh out of the oven. Won't be back and won't recommend it to anyone.",

Our antipasto of calimari fritti was large, perfectly prepared and served with an ample portion of marinara sauce and quartered lemons.  My dinner of Spaghetti Classici with meatballs was very well done. The spaghetti was perfectly al dente; the meat sauce was rich and flavorful. There were two large meatballs of excellent flavor and texture. The overall portion size was large enough to fill me up and still have a good sized take home portion.  My wife's dinner of Linguine alla Vongole was also very well done. (She let me taste.) The pasta for this dish was also perfectly al dente. The creamy sauce had just the right mix of Alfedo flavoring without the thickness of an Alfedo sauce. The sauce was very rich in clams and the presentation included a full complement of clams still in their shells. The shells were fully opened. Again, the overall portion size was large enough to fill her up and still have a good sized take home portion.  The atmosphere is classic Las Vegas with good wait staff service.",

    "text": "This was the first time in a few years since we've  been to the Bootlegger.  Honest opinion is that we should've stayed AWAY a few more years!  Stopped in for lunch and had a very pleasant server named Janie. No complaints on service with her at all! Food was ok in taste but nothing like I remember it! Caesar salad was really good but overpriced for lunch.  Next, came the issue. My daughter ordered cheese ravioli with their rose sauce rather than marinara. We didn't wait an unreasonable amount of time before our entrees were served, but my daughter's plate reached the table with marinara sauce rather than rose sauce! She told the server and Janie did recall the request.  The dish was remade with the correct sauce and of course we ate in shifts because I was finished with my lunch by then.  My daughter requested to speak with the manager regarding a discount on the meal for all the inconvenience.  The server said she would \"get the manager\" and she graciously apologized for the situation.  The so called manager NEVER came to the table and told the server he \"wouldn't discount or take off anything.\"  I've never seen such poor customer relations in ANY restaurant I've been to! What makes it worse is that he had no sack to do his own dirty work! He had the server come over and convey his answer! She was very nice and apologetic and I felt bad that he even put his employee in an awkward position. But we will not be going back to The Bootlegger nor will we recommend this place to visitors. This town is built on its reputation of CUSTOMER SERVICE and not just the product being sold!  Furthermore,  too many good Italian restaurants in town to frequent one where you're business isn't respected, appreciated OR wanted!",

I have been to many different Italian Restaurants in my lifetime but NEVER EVER have I been to one that gave you a plate of spaghetti with ONE little meatball! That is not Italian. Italians are very generous with their portions and give you either two or three good size meataballs! The guy who sat us needed some lessons in customer service. He had no personality whatsoever! My husband is really outgoing and greets everyone with a smile. This guy that seated us had the most deadpan facial expression I have ever seen in my life. I read some of the reviews and wondered if maybe the ones that gave this restaurant 5 stars were friend or relatives of the owners of this place. I just don't get it. The food was nothing to rave over and the service was just average. I'm sure I will not be returning to this place. If you want a nice place for good Italian food and more than one meatball go to Dean's place or Minutos!",

We arrived there at about 10 PM after watching the David Copperfield show at MGM Grand.  The restaurant was not crowded and we had no problems getting seated.  Someone else mentioned on here that it took a while for the food to come out but the wait was worth it.  They were correct.  The food was EXCELLENT!  Everyone enjoyed the entrees they ordered and the appetizers and dessert were just as good.  Our waitress informed us that everything was freshly made and that is why it took so long for the food to come out.  She was an excellent waitress and as we were in no hurry, waiting for the food just allowed us more time to enjoy one another's company.  Thanks to the reviewer who informed us it would take a while for the food to come out.  Thus, we scheduled dinner after the show because of this.    Our thanks to all of the posters on Yelp.  It made planning for our trip seamless!",

I was there this past Saturday with a party of 9 having a 7:30 reservation.  We were sat by 7:40, awesome.  The server came over took our drink order immediately and had the beverages out in a reasonable amount of time.  Then we ordered our food, a few of us ordered salads.  The salads were out in about fifteen minutes.... completely acceptable.  They were all delicious, and while we waited for them we were brought the garlic bread which is always yummy.  Then we waited for our food.  We understand that for a party that size it may take a few min longer.  But we waited and waited and waited.  We brought it to the managers attention after an hour, she was snappy with us saying the kitchen is backed up and we'd have to wait.  By 9:10 I begged the server to please just bring the two children in our party their food.  They received that within ten more minutes.  Finally at 9:35 our food came out, more than an hour and a half after ordering.  We let the manager know we weren't happy and it was unacceptable.  Once the food came out, a few orders were correct.  We had three vegetarians in the party.  We thought we were good ordering vegetarian dishes.  Two orders of eggplant parmesan and a Cappelini de Pomodoro.  The eggplant was delicious, however the pasta with it couldn't be eaten.  The Pomodoro on the other hand had a thick meat sauce.  I ended up not eating at all. The server offered to replace the dish but after the wait for the first time around, I didn't figure I'd make it to work the next morning had I of waited!  The manager reluctantly took off 25%, but after the experience we had that didn't feel like the right compensation.  The manager was rude to the servers who were trying to appease the guests, they were fighting amongst themselves over which tables should get their food first.  It was really an awful restaurant experience.  I felt bad because I really talked this place up to my family who was in visiting from California and it did not compare to my set up of it.",

Heck, he gave us a coupon for a free bottle of vino with our meal(I wonder how much grease he gets per referral). It was walking distance from our hotel. The food was great! The food there reminds me of the old Pernicano's in San Diego. Lot's of Rat Pack era memorabilia on the wall. A great menu and wine list. Our waiter Richard was top notch. I would recommend this place to anyone....",

The shrimp scampi I ordered for dinner was the best I have ever had!  Everyone in our party of four was more than pleased with their meal and service!  We were fortunate to be there on a night when Dennis Bono stepped up to the mic for a few songs, he brought down the house.  This a must go to restaurant, you not only get the ambiance of old Italy and the old Rat Pack but you feel as if you are just a part of a really big family while dining.  The food is very authentic and the entertainment is what pushes the entire experience over the top!  I look forward to trying something new every time!",

It is very hit and miss especially on the service which tends to be \"sparse.\"  Food is decent but lasagne is half cheese which is like a glob on your plate. How can an authentic Italian restaurant do that to lasagne? The best part which is why i rated this as high as a three is the minestrone soup which is darn good on a chilly day especially with some warm bread.",

They start your meal off with a basket of garlic knots and marinara sauce that are delicious. The price range for the meals run from about $15 for average pasta dishes up to about  $32 for Italian specialities.  Be prepared though with the pasta dishes you pay extra for a salad.  Their manicotti was excellent and you get 2 pretty good sized ones for the price. Dessert runs around  $8 for tirimisu, but the portion is comparable to other places if not a little bigger. The atmosphere is nice and if you want to have a nice dinner just as a couple or something bigger with family etc you will enjoy it no matter what.",

First time was a drunken stumble after a night of partying, it was the only place at 5A you can order a pizza on the way home.  Minestrone wasn't on the menu but after asking the server he came back with the best minestrone I've ever had.  Fast forward to regular dining hours, the minestrone tasted different but it was still very good, not sure if the first time was because I was so drunk and soup just hit the spot.  Nonetheless, the pasta carbonara was cooked perfectly, the calamari was cooked perfectly and the rest of my dining crew enjoyed the pizza like they always do.  Bootlegger is one of our go to spots anytime of the day!",

A few housekeeping things about this place ... it's south of the strip, it's pretty much a locals place, it gets crowded (make a reservation) and it's not cheap.  You're going to spend a $15 - $30 per person (with drinks).  You'll get large portions and good quality Italian food.  If that doesn't scare you away keep reading.  I've been here about a dozen time and have always had great service.  I've had great experiences in large and small groups, they do a great job in the service area.  It's hard to recommend a single dish here because they have all been so good.  I'm going off the beaten path here a bit and say you have to try the garlic knots.  Think bread sticks but 100 times better.  I'd go back for the knots alone.  You're not going to be disappointed with the food, it's pretty damn good!",

Featuring a full menu 24 hours, 7 days a week, you'll have plenty of time to fit this restaurant into your itinerary. I was lucky enough to be with a party that reserved the large private building in the back. The decor was elegant, complete with chandeliers and historic pictures.   For dinner, I tried the \"Salmone,\" which was pan seared salmon served with salmon stuffed ravioli. What interested me most about this dish was the squid ink black ravioli shells, which were light but slightly chewy. The salmon itself was slightly sub par, being dry and lacking in the typical juicy flavor of the fish.   Overall, the environment was nicely decorated, and the food was interesting enough. If you have a car, it's worth the trip off the strip. If not, I'd hunker down at an establishment with better flavor.",

The sauce was watered down and lacked flavor.  My dad and fiance didn't care for their meal either.  I thought the entrees were high in price for the value and quality of the food.

The service was slow but in a relaxing way because we weren't in a rush and it meant all of the food was fresh. The food wasn't spectacular but it was very good and above average for sure. It was a nice option for a meal off the strip.   As much as I enjoyed my dish, I will say the lasagna was the way to go. I can definitely see why they call it their house specialty. I ordered the pollo Francese which came with a side of fettuccini Alfredo. Really enjoyed the light white wine sauce and the chicken was a thicker cut of breast than usual but sauteed well. The fettuccini was thankfully on the lighter side of takes on pasta with Alfredo sauce. Not the most memorable meal we had but surely one we enjoyed.",

My husband ordered meat raviolis with meat sauce and I had the rigatoni bake. Both of our dishes were delicious! The rigatoni was a very hearty portion I wasnt even able to finish 1/2 of it so my husband helped me finish it and enjoyed every bite. We will definitely return to the Bootlegger next time we are in Las Vegas.",

The Spaghetti, the prons, the specials on Friday night, the stuff shells, the chicken Alfredo, the steak, the salads, the bread. We have just had amazing experience with the staff who is extremely professional, very friendly, very educated and helpful. The staff is extremely tentative no matter how busy they are and you never have to ask for anything because they're right on top of it. The drinks are fantastic. You have to try the lemon cheesecake.Highly recommend this place. I would post pictures but the food is so delicious, that I can't let it sit there.",

Oscar was helpful in his suggestions, fun to chat with, and very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He kept drinks (and stomachs!!) full all the time and definitely is a professional in every sense of the word. They bring you little squares of bread with a meat sauce that are like little bites of heaven while you're waiting for your first course. We had mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and they were homemade and didn't fall apart at all when you bit into them. My Mom had the Papperdelle Bolognese, the egg noodles, again, seemed to be homemade and were perfect for the hearty bolognese sauce. The sauce was amazing. Just perfect. I had the Capellini al Pomodoro Rustica. Cloves of garlic, chunks of tomato and perfectly al dente Capellini pasta. We rounded out our meal with Lemocello and Lemon Sorbet. All excellent. You will not be disappointed in this gem!!",

The server brought us little square bread pieces, they were good, but the Italian dipping sauce was amazing. I'm on a diet but I couldn't stop eating them. I ordered the chicken Saltimboca and it was amazing. The chicken was a little overdone which is why I knocked off a half star. But, it was still one of the best dishes I've ever had. Next time I'll have it with veal. My wife had lasagna and it was a large portion with an excellent sauce very much like the dipping sauce. My daughter had the fettuccine alfredo. It had a very creamy sauce that tasted really fresh. This is her go to dish and she gave it two thumbs up. We shared Cannolis which were very good but obscenely rich. We also shared the Tiramisu which was the best I've ever tasted. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants. Now I just have to find an excuse to go there again.",

So you'll just have to see my five star rating and believe me. I had the meat ravioli, which was cooked perfectly and the sauce was a perfect mixture of salty-slightly sweet. My husband got the pappardelle bolognese and it was probably the best version of the dish I can say I've ever had. It was also perfectly seasoned, well cooked, and almost melts in your mouth.

It's a simple thing but makes a big difference and would have helped to melt said butter. Ordered a side of bacon which was nicely cooked but was just warm. The other person in our group had the frittata which she liked but it was not more than warm as well.

The marsala sauce was just flavorful enough, and the chicken was very tender. No need for a knife. I'm sure I'll be back.  On a side note. Connected to the restaurant is The Copa Room. On Monday nights, a band called \"Santa Fe and the Fat City Horns\" play there. They are phenomenal! The venue is also very nice. Great atmosphere!

Food is spectacular, service was the best I can remember. And when you get such good service it makes the food taste better, the wine sweeter and the experience special.  We commented on our excellent experience to the host and found out this is a True family run restaurant. He was the grandson of the founder and the love they have for this place showed.  The music was a nice touch and if you get there before your dinner then stop off at the bar for beautiful libations.  If you are in Las Vegas and want the best restaurant I have been to in this town then stop by the south end of Las Vegas blvd  and treat yourself to excellence.",

Eddie, our server, was kind, patient and efficient. The bussers in our area were also very hard-working and did a great job keeping the restaurant very clean and ready for the next customer. They have a full bar, delicious appetizers and good desserts. The restaurant is open 24/7 in the quiet area of South Las Vegas Blvd. About 8 miles south of Sahara Blvd. Recommend making reservations between the hours of 5pm and 7pm. You can tell the family takes a lot of pride in their restaurant.",

It took him a long time to respond but when he did, he told my fiance to get the cheese ravioli. And my fiance wanted to add mushrooms. We thought there would be so much more options because when I looked on yelp there was a lot. Not only that. He forgot to put our mushrooms in there and he forgot to put in our cease salad. Our server kept talking to this customers at the bar.   Our salad never came out , his ravioli came out no mushroom. And we informed him about the salad and the salad came out overly dressed to the point we lost our appetite.   Come back? Hmmm maybe if this was the only option",

I thought it was just a bar with possibly a small dining room.  I was not expecting this place to be such a swanky joint.    The lunch  menu is outstanding!!  The garlic bread they bring out is good.  Our server brought out 3 ramekin's of marinara sauce, once for each of us.  That was super thoughtful, because double dipping is necessary!!  We ordered a chicken parm sandwhich, spaghetti and meatball, and lasagna.  My buddy said the chicken parm is his second favorite in town.  That says a lot since he ALWAYS orders a chicken parm sandwhich at every sandwich shop we go to!!  My other buddy got the lunch spaghetti and meatball.  It came with a house salad that was pretty substantial in its own right.  He said he was kind of full from just the salad and bread, but he toughed it out and ate his spaghetti.  He said it was really good, and overall a great value.  I had the lasagna and it was really good.  I would say it is one of the better lasagna's I've eaten.    Overall I was very impressed with the entire place.  Our server was super friendly and helpful when ordering.  He provided excellent service, I only wish I caught his name.  Will definitely be back.",

Across the parking lot, I found Bootlegger Italian Bistro. The outside was sort of confusing to me, but we found our way in. We entered a calm, cool atmosphere and ate in the dining room. The decor was to be expected, but as soon as we sat down the service began. I ordered the House Specialty Lasagna... It was the most delicious lasagna I've ever had! It was a generous portion and brought back (hotel) home leftovers. Love, love, love it!",

The service was quick to bring drinks and the delicious bread with the warm marinara sauce to dip.   For entree's we all ordered either the pappardelle bolognese or the meat lasagna. The noodles are very good and the dish comes with plenty of sauce. I tried the meat lasagna my wife had and it's basically deconstructed, instead of a tall classic lasagna, it's laid flat and very meaty / saucy. After eating the noodles and lasagna we asked for more bread to soak up the delicious sauce.   Very attentive staff and plentiful servings guaranteed to fill you up or to take home for another snack. Will be back for more.",

It will take 30 minutes according to our waiter whom I will not name as he was pretty good. There was Not much taste to the sauce as we are Italian and know good sauce. It was cooked ok but the lack of taste will not bring us back there. My friends are Not Italian but liked the LaSagna & Shrimp dishes that they had.  But there are much better Italian Rest here in Vegas and I have posted a few on here too.",

I ordered the Maria's saltimbocca for the main course and the meal takes a little longer to prepare but was it worth the wait?

Visit Bootlegger Bistro if you not only want to dine, if you want to have some excellent entertainment. This place is part of Vegas history yet seems to be the best kept secret in the city. It's not unusual for major show headliners to come here and participate in the entertainment experience. The musical entertainment here is really enjoyable and when you combine that with great food, well you have a place that you'll want to come to over and over again. For the visitors to Vegas who might just be shopping a block away at the Outlet Mall, don't miss the Bootllegger Bistro. What's cool about this restaurant is that you really can pick to dine at whatever price point you would like- You can spend a little or a lot, that's up to you. We've had great times inviting special friends to join us for dinner to celebrate many good things that have happened and we've been here in the middle of the night when we had to wait around before going to the airport. I remember reading the menu in the early hours by flashlight and having a fun breakfast while playing some video poker. Check the schedule of entertainment in advance if that's part of why you are going here and enjoy.",

The restaurant was packed per usual. Our table was within viewing & listening distance of the live piano performer (wonderful) but not so close we couldn't enjoy conversing. As always service was top notch, and our group devoured the hot garlic bread knots with marinara served on the house. Each of us tried a house salad (yummy) and something different like lasagna with meat sauce, steak, pork chop, fish & Alfredo, all meals were great, no complaints. I always get the lasagna, it's so creamy, meaty, and cheesy I can't bear to not order it! We ordered up 2 bottles of good red & had to pass on desert. Our waiter took care of us perfectly throughout the meal. Great place never disappointed. Food quality high.",

As for dinner, the free bread was excellent, but don't overlook the bruschetta. I'm not usually one to order spaghetti and meatballs, but that dish (half meatball and half sausage) was really outstanding. Good choice. And did I mention the Monday entertainment (Monday...)?",

Well 20 minutes later they sat another family whose reservation was later than ours. Then the service from our waiter was horrible. My husband ordered a steak and was not brought a steak knife and I ordered pasta with no spoon. Not only that but our waiter never stopped by to see how our dinner was or if there was anything else we needed. On top of that once we finished our dinner he returned to offer us a dessert menu in which it took almost 20 minutes for him to return and by then just wanted to get out of there. The food was good but the service absolutely sucked in where we will not return.",

The waiter forgot I ordered a ceasar salad so it came out ten minutes after my wifes.  He did bring it out after I reminded him but it was terrible.  Warm wilted romaine, barely any dressing and probably a quarter cup of cheese.  Then the carbonara sauce on my pasta had broken and it was a oily mess.  I salvaged what I could, but it was pretty unpleasant.  Kathryn's fish was a bit salty, but good otherwise.  The bread and tiramisu were very good though.  I credit them for comping my meal, but we will not be going back.",

Was seated well over 10 min and we never acknowledged by any of the bar staff. Finally the bartender comes over, no apology for the wait, no excuse for not at least acknowledging our presence. Drinks were ok, but I can tell you the food was great but the service was so horrible, we left after food and 1 drink. We were gaming $.25 max bet with over $100 in the machine. Never were we asked if we wanted another drink, HORRIBLE SERVICE. .. Denise was the bartender .... No tip!!!",

SO, your only 3 miles from Mandalay Bay if your looking for a tasty dinner off the strip.  Restaurant opened in 1949. Many celebrities from the 50's on including Sinatra, rat pack and Elvis have dined here. Definitely a 5 star!!",

Do not order the 8.00 very very sad looking house dinner salad.

We will never order the salads from here again very disappointing I've seen more lettuce as the garnish on a burger. The best thing I can say about it, is that it was cold.",

I assume they use them after midnight when they are open, but they lock the doors and make you ring a bell? We were not that late.  We got there before midnight and got a late night menu. I was not that hungry, and wanted to keep the price low so I ordered the French Toast mostly out of curiosity that they coat it with Captain Crunch cereal. I expected to actually have crunchy toast and it was not. Overall I wasn't really impressed and probably would not order this again. They give you bread at the beginning and the star of that is the marinara sauce that comes with it. Both my husband and I agreed, it was very good. My husband got the vegetable lasagna and he liked it but it didn't really look like a lasagna, it had a LOT of cheese. I got to try it and enjoyed it, but it felt very decadent for someone that is trying to lose weight.  One of us ordered tea and never got a refill or an offer for one. Being late the service was eh. The bartender spent all her time talking to locals or regulars or friends? Then one waiter.  I actually did want to return to try their pizzas, but I ended up buying one at the grocery store instead. Maybe next time? Overall, cute place. Lots of little history things inside. Close to our icky timeshare. I am sure we will return.",

The calamari was perfect and we ended with a lemon cheesecake. We had seen the menu on line and knew exactly what we wanted.   Our server Richard was awesome. He constantly checked to make sure everything was fine, and that our drinks (soda and tea) were always full. The only reason this isn't a 5 star is because you can not believe what the internet says as far as prices.  The veal price on the on-line was $26.00 when I got the bill it was $32.00. The lasagna on line was $17.00 on the bill $20.00 the manager did credit $6 of the $9 difference. I feel that the restaurant should honor the prices they post and if they should update their website.  Bravo to the staff, not so much the management.",

His attitude was unacceptable. So we cannot sit and enjoy your holiday dinner? We went to talk to him upfront about this and he cursed at us, while we were walking back to the table.

    "text": "Mama Mia! Gotta love my peoples and a good ol' Italian restaurant, especially with live music and that old Vegas/rat pack vibe!!  The hubbs & I stumbled upon this place on a Saturday night not realizing it was an Italian restaurant (we're EXTREMELY selective about trying new Italian restaurants) we were pleasantly surprised - what a great dinner!! The garlic knots with dipping sauce were delish as were our main dishes - pasta for him & divine, melt-in-your-mouth Chilean sea bass for me.  We left happy & stuffed, like one should after having a great Italian meal & experience (service was excellent!).  We will definitely be back to enjoy some more great Italian food since this place is open 24 hours and is at the south end of the strip away from the tourists and traffic.",

The ambience was amazing and super legit Italian like. The food was great and filling. Also wasn't too packed because it being a Thursday late night I'm assuming.   Richard, our server, was freaking incredible. Dude deserves a bonus.  His jokes made us laugh and his service was great.   Highly recommend.",

    "text": "This was our first time coming in for dinner. I've already got a to order list for my next visit.   Two dinning options.   You can sit in the dinning room with live music or sit in the lounge. We opted for the lounge to watch the game and have a bit less noise. The live music can be a little loud, especially if it is not your taste in music.   The lounge area had tables and chairs. The booths and the bar area you have to be 21+.   They serve complimentary garlic bread with marinara sauce to dip in. It's very easy to fill up on this stuff because it is so good.  For appetizers we took the advice of our server and got the stuffed mushrooms. Also ordered the wedge salad. Both were delicious! I had to refrain from licking the left over cream sauce that the mushrooms come in from the plate.  The wedge salad was good too. Had a creamy blue cheese dressing on it. The blue cheese was just right, not over powering in flavor.   I was torn between the spaghetti with meat sauce or their pappardelle bolognese. So I went with our server's suggestion again and got the bolognese. The big egg noodles were very filling. The sauce was creamy, meaty and very tasty!  My guy ordered their chicken fettuccine alfredo. The creamy alfredo sauce was good.  Portions of both pastas were worth the price.   I was smart and saved room for dessert. My guy went home hurting from overeating. I picked out the lemon cheesecake for us to split and I am so glad I did! I've never had anything like it. The flavor of lemon had a strong presence and was perfectly tart to balance out the cheesecake. The graham cracker crust was excellent but my favorite part was the top. They had some kind of crumble baked on top that gave the cheesecake some texture. They also topped it with berries adding more flavor and texture.",

Had to sit at a high top even though there were tables empty the whole time.  They forgot my drink order for a while, but I was so happy with the food I didn't mind too much.    The only thing about the food I wasn't thrilled with was the relative lack of meat in the baked penne, but my friend got the Angelo and had plenty of chicken.   Prices are reasonable for the presentation and flavor.  The food was delivered quickly.  The only thing a little weird was so many different people involved.  Waiter, bus boy, manager, and food deliverers.  I hope the waiter shares tips.",

There is a lot of history here and our waiter took some time to explain the origins of the restaurant and that the great grandson of the founder currently works as a buser (I think). It really is a family business. In the large dining room we were seated there was someone playing the harp for the entire duration of our meal (nearly 3 hours) which was a really nice touch.  Our waiter was outstanding. Our group enjoyed some nice apps - stuffed mushrooms, calamari and more and the garlic knots they bring you to start were excellent.  My entree was also very flavorful. Definitely a solid Italian spot if you are interested in venturing off the strip.",

    "text": "I have eaten here quite a few times. My sister (may she R.I.P. 07/11/18) was actually the one who introduced it to me when she decided to eat here for dinner. She knew that I love Italian food, and this restaurant was one of the places she enjoyed eating. My first experience was great. The service was good, the food was great, and the dessert was even better.  The next few times, I actually took various friends here for latenight. The service was terrible and they give you 1/2 the food portion. I ordered a cappuccino and I was actually brought an espresso. They rarely check on you, unless you're not Asian, apparently. I actually tip well, 25~35%, depending on service. Although, if service isn't up to par, I will obviously tip less than usual.  I tried ordering take-out here once and not sure if it is just me, but the host didn't even give me my change.. I know it was only $10, but still, you should always give change back to a customer unless instructed by the customer to keep it.  I decided one day to dine here a bit earlier with a couple of my friends, after the gym. I know we weren't dressed up, but that didn't mean we didn't have money. We just came from the gym and were hungry. The live music brought a nice ambiance, but the service killed that ambiance. No one checked on our table until we were finished with our meals. No one came by to refill our drinks. They presented us with the bill when we hadn't even had dessert yet. We weren't even offered dessert, and had to ask for the dessert menu. Where were those hard-working people who served me the first time I dined here..? Well, that was about 5 years ago, so they're probably gone now.  This place was 4.5-stars to me, but now they're in the 2.5-3's, mainly because of service. So many chances were given, so not anymore. I love the food, but I guess it's best for me to avoid this place with my friends and just stick with my favorite Italian restaurant, in the west side of the city. At least then we would actually receive adequate service.",

    "text": "Certainly you've heard the stories and reputation of the Bootlegger and it's famous and infamous clientele.  It's cool to know the folks that have hung in this joint, the image the deals that have been made, but at the end of the day, everyone is eating.  Nice dining room, with live music and an atmosphere that encourages relaxing, having a drink or three and talking about whatever your business is that particular evening.  Grab yourself a whiskey Old Fashion, Scotch or Martini or even a nice red wine - something to set the mood, that dark, swank crooner era vibe and enjoy.  We started with the Calamari Fritti or your basic breaded and fried calamari.  Meh, little chewy for me, probably wouldn't get it again.  Also, had the Antipasti Classic which is descried as Italian cold cuts, cheeses, olives, peppers and marinated vegetables.  Not that it wasn't those things, but it looked more like prosciutto with some parmigiana, roast red peppers, olives and maybe a pepperoncini.  Again, meh, wouldn't get it again.  For my entree I selected the Scallopini di Vitello and the picatta option.  That is a beautiful stack of veal cutlets sauteed in a lemon and wine sauce.  Yeah, it comes with pasta too.  Veal piccata is not complicated, it's simply a lightly breaded and pounded cutlet, cooked in a butter, lemon and wine with capers, but it's the simplicity of the dish that makes a legit serving stand out.  This is legit, with a complex and delicious blend of flavors and textures enhanced by the tart lemon, salty capers and a delectable pan sauce.  Enjoy an evening here with the history and the piccatta!",

    "text": "Prologue: My fiancee and I arrived in Las Vegas a few hours later than we had anticipated and we were looking for someplace good to have dinner that was open late. The attendant at the RV Park where we were staying recommended this restaurant.  The Plot: After taking a few minutes to look over their Night Owl menu, we started by sharing an order of Calamari Fritti followed by the Papardelle Bolognese entree.  My fiancee also spotted the Steak & Eggs Breakfast on the menu and, since it was nearly midnight in Las Vegas, she decided to order that as well.  The Scene: The portion sizes were decent and were plenty for the two of us.  The Calamari Fritti was marinated and lightly breaded then flash fried and served with marinara sauce. My fiancee usually passes on fried foods, especially appetizers. However, she did enjoy this dish and remarked about how tender and tasty the calamari was.  The Papperdelle Bolognese consisted of imported egg noodles with traditional Bolognese meat sauce and shaved parmesan cheese. Thinking back it occurred to me that it had been quite a long time since the last time I ordered wide egg noodles at a restaurant; it's something you don't see on most menus. The texture of the egg noodles was perfect for me, the Bolognese sauce was spot on, and this dish took me right back to my childhood. This was the first time my fiancee tried pasta with Bolognese sauce and she was very impressed.  The ambiance and decor were very Las Vegas, which was a nice touch. The prices were reasonable for late night in Las Vegas.  The Rest of the Story: The Steak & Eggs Breakfast was just that. We ordered the steak medium well and that's exactly how it was prepared. The home fries were very good, cooked just a little crispy and nicely seasoned. Otherwise this dish was nothing special.  They were out of the Antipasti Classico, which was a little disappointing. However, the Calamari Fritti made up for it.  Epilogue: Good food, reasonable prices, and convenient location open 24 hours deserved 4 stars. However, we decided to settle on 3 stars due to the Steak & Eggs Breakfast being subpar compared to the other items. We'll be sure to stick with only Italian food next time.",

    "text": "Wifeypie and I walked in this past Monday, we arrived about midnight.  I would have liked to have given the place a 3-4 star review. The service was not great but I did not expect much at the late hour, so I could get past that. The food was actually pretty darn good!  Why then the 1 star review you ask? We were seated in the bar area as they had closed the dining room, and as soon as our food arrived, one of the employees sat at the bar, not 10 feet from us, and lit up a cig (this employee appeared to be management, the way he was dressed). Next thing ya know, two other employees did the same, so we were sitting there engulfed with smoke while trying to enjoy our dinners. I asked our waitperson if it was legal and I was met with \"ummmmm, it's just what they do when it's after hours.\" Keep in mind this establishment is open 24/7, when is after hours? I did not want to make a stink (all pun intended) and asked to be moved, and we were seated outside. By the way, this is not a bar that you would consider you could smoke at in Vegas, this really is a part of the restaurant.  IMHO this was just lame. We were not the only people dining there, and there was no consideration for the patrons. These employees (two waitpersons and the gentleman that appeared to be management) never asked the diners if it would bother them, they just sat down and had at it.  When we walked in there was some great music and again the food was very good, however I do not think I would return. Whoever owns this place, if you read this, you should wrangle in your help!  Just my humble mindya,  Moi",

Food portions were generous and tasty, the waiter was very kind, the Italian decor was nice and not tacky, we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "This is one of Rosebud's favorites, so we've been here many times. At first it was because a friend informed us that Ruth Brown performed there Thursday nights and we had to go before she died. So we did, and it was great, and then she died as predicted. (I assume they have other fine entertainment but I will let them live in peace. RIP, Ruth).    Anyway, we went once when I was not in the mood for Italian, so I ordered the rib eye special and it was one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. I also agreed to go on one of the rare occasions when Babygirl and I were on a diet, so we ordered the light entrees: her fish, me chicken. They were both well cooked, moist and delicious, and served with on beds of spinach with sides of steamed broccoli and whole wheat pasta with marinara. We hardly missed the cheesy stuff.  But, mostly we keep coming back because they serve hands down my absolute favorite lasagna in town. (At least since the old Venetian on West Sahara closed down. Sob.)  Rather than a square like is usually served, their version is more like a slice of a tall layer cake, with one of the layers being a big, rich section of ricotta filling. YUM! It's served lying on its side with sauce and melted mozzarella bubbling on top.   Unless, of course, you're my sister. In that case, everyone else's lasagna was as described. She inexplicably got a cold one. So, she sent it back and the waiter brought it out heated, but it had suffered from its sojourn in the microwave and was now \"too soggy\". So, she flagged the waiter down yet again and sent it on another trip to the kitchen. This time, the brought her out a new one, which was hot and fresh, but by then she had consumed enough of someone else's chicken that she was no longer hungry. It looked like a prime target for scavengers or tasty leftovers, but there was no competition for it. Guess we all put in enough time in the restaurant business to figure no way was that coming out on the third run unscathed.  Anyway, it wasn't the lasagna incident that cost the fifth star (Bad experiences follow my sister around like a black cloud. I promise you it was her and not them).  No, the lower rating is due to my pet peeve: Lasanga is priced reasonably enough at 17 or 18 dollars, but it does not include a salad. Or even bread. You have to buy an order of garlic knots. Nothing I hate more. Jeez. Raise the price a couple of bucks and throw me some damned lettuce. We'll all be happy.",

    "text": "I loved dinner last night. I had the Salmon, spinach and angel hair whole wheat pasta in marinara sauce. Every item on my plate was pure perfection! Moist and well seasoned fish, flavorful spinach, tasty marinara. Our service was spot on! The live piano music was a lot of fun. The singer will be performing at the Smith Center on August and I am going to make a point to hear him in concert again with friends.   My group had fettuccini Alfredo and egg plant Parmesan and we all had Mozzarella salads. My only comment on the food is the slice of tomato on the salad was flavorless. Now let me tell you about the bread they serve..,sooooo good! Served with marinara dipping sauce. Could be a meal on its own.   We didn't eat dessert, well we will be back and leave room for dessert. Total cost $150 for 4 people with wine and salads. Best Italian meal we've had in Las Vegas.",

Twenty minutes later the attendant took us to the bar for a table.  This was the same man we requested the booth with. We told him again we wanted the dining room and a booth.  He then said it would be another twenty minutes.  Forty minutes later we checked the status and frankly they acted as if they could care less so after standing at the counter with no one assisting us, we left.  As stated in my prior review, we have been coming here and over 25 years... I understand being busy but they were disinterested and rude... We are taking a break from the Bootlegger.",

With that said, it is not the full menu, but a pretty good menu. I do not like eating before a show, I get antsy. I want to enjoy my meal, with my friends and not worry about time constraints before getting to my seats. I rarely eat at casinos, because let's face it. I am a local. A born and bred local. I know what the the Strip was like in the good ol' days and this Vegas is not the good ol' days. If I want to hear live music, I can at the Bootlegger. If I see a show on the Strip and want to eat afterwards. I can count on the Bootlegger. The only bad thing about the Bootlegger is so far away from The Smith Center, but I will still drive on the crowded I-15 to eat and have a wonderful relaxing time at the Bootlegger. I am so glad that there are still places that do Vegas the way Vegas used to be.",

I will point out that the 2 hosts running the front desk were borderline rude as they stood there and waited for us to ask if we needed anything. Seriously. It's not hard to say hi or welcome, geez. Anyways, left a bad impression of this place until our server came along. She was bright, energetic and professional.   We tried many dishes but the one thing I'd come back for is the fettuccine Alfredo with house made sausage. It's everything you'd expect from a good fettuccine, toothsome pasta, velvety smooth Alfredo topped with fork tender sausage. Creamy tender porky.",

Old school vibe and usually live entertainment evenings. They have a piano bar. Don't be bashful take your drink over and sit at it,, it's really cool.  Prices are so reasonable and service is so good you can't get hurt giving them a try. They can get slammed at times so take that into consideration if the service slows down a bit.

It couldn't have been more perfect!  The food and staff were phenomenal and the atmosphere was so much more personal than it would have been in a resort restaurant.  We were given a menu where we could select three entrees for guests to choose from.  Pollo Parmesana, Pork Chop Marsala and Tilapia Francese were all deemed the \"best\" when I asked the guests what they selected.  The champagne was very good and the wait staff made sure that everyone was taken care of.  They allowed us to bring the wedding cake from the chapel and served it for guests after dinner.  The piano player/singer added so much to the evening.  He sang to the bride and groom and they were allowed a couple of dances at the front of the restaurant.   Prices were more than reasonable and the staff couldn't have been better.  This will become a definite stop each visit to Vegas in the future!",

Unfortunately I have to give this place a poor review after several visits. I love old Vegas as much as the next guy but that's all this place has going for it. The food is below Olive Garden IMO and I have had several different dishes. The lowlight was the chicken angelo- small half breast, no zest, served with an alfredo sauce that turns into gelatin the second it gets under 140 degrees. All that for over 15.00? No thanks.  This place is for the older weathly folks with dulled taste buds, folks that come in for the terrific entrainment and younger wanna bes (no offense wanna bes)",

Big overstuffed booths, professional servers all dressed alike with formal attire, classic dishes that are expertly crafted.   They start you with these addictive garlic bread bites that are covered in garlic and olive oil.  Be careful or you will fill up on them before your entree arrives!     We had a starter of fried calamari and I have to say it was one of the top 5 best I have ever enjoyed.  The portions are generous and the quality of the food is top notch. After the garlic bites, starter and an entree we had no room for dessert.    If you want a classic Italian dining experience, you should take a trip to south Las Vegas Blvd and give this joint a try.  I know we will be back again.",

My father, born and raised in Sicily and a chef for his entire life, ordered a dish and when it came was not what he had ordered. The fish was completely dry and did not have sauce on it as it should have. This was our final straw. Upon arrival, the host station was empty. We arrived just after 5 and had to stand out in the front lobby for approximately 10 minutes before someone happen to see the group of 6 of us standing there.  Once seated, our waiter walked up and said, \"I see you have your water\", dropped off bread and walked away. My wife had to order a glass of wine when he was ready to walk away. Our waiter came back took our food order and we never saw him again at our table. Another waiter stepped in a took over the table. Second waiter was much better.  I had signed up for the VIP reward program earlier in the day and was told by both waiters I would need to print it out to use it. This is 2017... how does a place still need the emailed coupon printed out?  I work 5 minutes from here. I know many people that come here during graveyard hours. Hopefully they have better experiences. For us, we will not be coming back.",

    "text": "Last night (6/1/13) I went here with my boyfriend before I leave for a month long business trip. After a long day of paper work and packing, we wanted something small and not too expensive which is why we skipped eating on The Strip.   When I see a place is open 24/7, I'm not expecting fine dining prices EVER. Unfortunately, the prices aren't listed on Yelp and we didn't see a menu outside. If I had known that chicken fettuccine alfredo was $19, there's no way I would have stepped foot in the place.   The lobby looked extra upscale, but the mannequin of a guy sitting at the counter scared me when I walked in. We showed up at 10:30 PM, so yeah, it was late and I was tired.   Only the bar area was open this late. There were some obnoxious people at the bar being loud, but I guess that's what you expect in Vegas on a Saturday night, I just wasn't expecting that with how fancy the lobby was.   The prices are insanity. I told my boyfriend that I was uncomfortable ordering anything, so we decided to split. He ordered the fettuccine alfredo and when prompted if we'd like salad, he said \"yeah.\" I told the waiter to just bring us a wedge salad ($9).   After we ordered, they brought us bread squares and a thin red dipping sauce that was good. I've never seen bread served like this so I wonder if it's made in house or if it's frozen and heated in the oven. It still tasted good.   The wedge salad comes with \"Maria's\" blue cheese dressing. I wonder if it's the same as \"Marie's\" blue cheese dressing from the cold section of the grocery store. There must have been half a jar poured on our salad - it was swimming in dressing. There was maybe 2 teaspoons of bacon on it.. Brio makes a much better, fresher and flavorful wedge and you get a lot more actual blue cheese crumbles and bacon on it.   Sometime between the salad and the entree, they turned out the lights completely so we ate in the light of the bar tvs.   The fettuccine alfredo came out with a nice looking pounded chicken breast on top. Unfortunately, the sauce was flavorless. For $19, that better be some of the best fettuccine alfredo that I've ever tasted. This was not. I took a few scoops and let my boyfriend eat about 3/4 of the dish. My non-Italian mom makes killer alfredo, so why can't this joint do that? Disappointing.   Our waiter was very good, but the food was lacking, it was extremely overpriced and we were sitting in the dark during our meal. This is not my idea of fun.   When we got up to leave, the front door was locked and it had a sign that said exit through the bar. We ended up on the patio and then figured out where the exit was. Embarrassing! I did notice all of the couples we walked past were also sharing one entree. It's just too expensive!",

    "text": "The Bootlegger has a nice bar, with dining table seating as well. The main restaurant is good sized and comfortable, complete with old-school Vegas lounge singers during certain times. The atmosphere is just fantastic. It's just dark enough with comfy curved booths.  They serve bread almost automatically when your seated. They call them Panetti's and they are one of my favorite things!  Panetti's are little square bites and are usually very garlicky and buttery. They serve them with a special red sauce for dipping. It's definitely not just a plain marinara.   The Fettuccine Alfredo is one of my all time favs. The alfredo sauce is SO delicious, tastes fresh and seems like it's made from scratch.  If it isn't, I better not find out where they buy it.  Because if I can buy it, I may never go out to dinner again.  My guy loves their lasagna, which doesn't come the way most of us would expect. They make HUGE pans of this layered goodness and serve big slices of it on it's side covered with red sauce.  But on this night, my guy had the house salad and the Pork Chop Marsala, a 12 oz. bone-in pork chop in Marsala mushroom sauce, served with rustic roasted potatoes and broccoli.  He was in heaven!  The pork was cooked the way he ordered it, and was moist and tender. I know, because I HAD to try some, of course!    Our waiter, was on top of things and very friendly to us. Eddie, our busser was a great guy! I had asked him some random questions and he was so helpful and nice to talk with. Throughout the evening I saw him interacting with numerous costumers and he always had a smile on his face. He's clearly a hard worker and takes pride in what he does.      As a lifetime local I highly recommend you taking the time to try this old-school Vegas treasure.",

Hung out in the bar while we waited and had a couple of glasses of red wine. The house red was very good. We got seated right near the piano, where a guy played classic Vegas music. My husband ordered the Veggie Lasagna, and he said it was the best he had ever had - even better than mine! What?!?! LOL! I had the Pollo Angelo, which was awesome. I told the waiter it was my husband's birthday, and for dessert he brought him the Chocolate Lava on the house, which tasted amazing, especially with our 4th glass of red wine :-) I would recommend this place if you like a darker, very romantic ambience for dinner. Food service, food, ambience all excellent!  So why only 4 stars instead of 5? Well, like I mentioned we got there at 7:00. I checked us in at the hostess desk, and she rolled her eyes and said: \"Your reservation is for 7:30, your early and I can't seat you until 7:30\". I said, yes, I know we're early, I just wanted to let you know that we are here. We will wait in the bar until you'e ready. She doesn't say anything, just points to the bar and looks back down to her reservation book. I started giggling, and thought, oh crap, I hope this isn't a prelude for the evening. Well, thankfully it wasn't. From the minute we headed to the bar until we walked out was fantastic! Please don't let the not-so-friendly hostess fool you, we will definitely visit this place again.",

    "text": "Haven't been here in a while...probably because it was my usual late night \"go to\" when I was young enough to stay out all night and scarf down a plate of carbs and still wake up with a flat stomach. :)  ...those days are long gone...!  Tonight my daughter wanted Italian after spending her tooth fairy money at the Disney store across the street. I recommended we go to Bootlegger since I hadn't been in so long!  She was hesitant since she has never been...I asked her to just trust me...  We were sat right away on a Saturday night!  Score!  The dining room was packed, we literally had the last available table.    As we were just getting seated a man began singing and playing the keyboard on stage in the main dining room. My daughter was mesmerized by the atmosphere as an older couple stood up in the middle of their meal and began to slow dance. \"Mom, can people just stand up and dance in here?\" I giggled and said, \"yeah!  Isn't that cute?!\"  She threw me the thumbs up and clapped really excitedly for the couple when the song ended. Cute.   I ordered the Salmone, a grilled salmon (explained to me by our server as \"flown in fresh daily\") w/seafood ravioli and my daughter ordered the cheese raviolis from the kids menu.  We also split the Caesar salad.   Honestly I thought the Caesar had too much dressing. But my daughter ate it all up!  If my kid will eat a full size salad and ask for more, I'm thrilled!   Our main course took a while to come out, but like I said it was busy. When the food finally arrived it was hot, beautifully plated and I was very impressed with my meal. As my daughter started working on hers, she said, \"mom, I know why the food took so long. It's because they were making sure it was JUST PERFECT!  It's sooooo good!\"  As she was finishing up her meal I asked, \"what's better, Bootlegger or Brio?\" she said \"Bootlegger!  On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this place a 20 out of 10!  The kids ravioli was JUST enough for her. No leftovers and I wasn't begging her to finish another bite to earn dessert.  (Trust me, a real Mother's Day miracle!)   Being that it was the eve of Mother's Day, I allowed her to pick a dessert off of the menu for us to share. Despite the pressure from both myself and the waiter to select the Lava Cake, she went with the Cheesecake drizzled in raspberry sauce. It was very good.  Our check was $66 including tip, not bad. Service was great despite the time it took for our main course to come out. The complimentary garlic bread they have come out is just as delicious as I remember, and their marinara is AMAZING. I'm not sure why I haven't ventured to this place for a meal during normal dinner hours, but with rave reviews from my little one and no complaints from me, we will definitely be back!   P.s. The mannequin at the front used to freak me out!  Totally didn't even see it this time when I walked in but in the middle of dinner Chloe goes, \"mom, there was a really weird guy at the front when we walked in. He kept staring at me and I waved at him but he didn't wave back. Did you see him?\" I chuckled and said, \"that's just a mannequin, Chloe! Don't be scared. He's a statue and won't wave back to you.\" She laughed at herself and said \"oh. I was really scared of that guy.\" lol",

    "text": "Bootlegger Bistro is a Vegas staple. The food will not rock your world but it is pretty good for a restaurant that has been around for like 50 years and is open 24 hours.  The service is always good and they now take reservations which is also a plus. They just recently changed the menu and have added gluten free choices. I was pretty excited about this as I eat gluten free. I asked the waiter how they were and he said it tasted like crap and was mushy. okay- well thanks for being honest and I will order regular pasta. =)  I always start with the Antipasti Classic. I will say that they used to have to different sizes ( small and large) and now they only have one. It is really small and if you are with a group, you will need to order 2. I wish they would have kept the different sizes. It is amazing no matter what size. I also order the Calamari Fritti which is pretty good, I can't complain at all.  For my meal, I always order the angel hair pasta with the rose sauce ( which is almost like a vodka sauce). Add a little hot pepper to this and OMG- pure goodness. The BF always gets the Papperdelle Bolognese and it is so good.. It can compete with some of the top restaurants I have been to.  The only thing I was disappointed with this time was the desserts. They changed the menu and the options are not very good. Hopefully they will be changing it to something better. Maybe add a mud pie or coffee ice cream cake.",

We walked in to the red leather booths and wrap around bar. We were seated immediately (as it was 6:30 on a Thursday) and ordered drinks.   I ordered a cocktail from the drink menu (one which I cannot remember -- it was the first on the menu) and did not like it. To the point where I could not drink it. I decided I had to tell my server to take it back. I. HATE. COMPLAINING. TO. SERVERS. So I panicked for a bit and then flagged down my server. He was SO NICE about it. He brought me a dirty martini instead, which was the ticket! I enjoyed my martini and the former was taken off the bill. Thanks, buddy!  I ordered the Baked Penne because according to Yelp it is the bomb. And Yelp was right. So much cheese to top the wonderful pasta sauce and penne. It was a large serving so I had lunch for the next day. My friend had the vegetarian lasagna with the white sauce and OH MY GOD. It was absolutely delicious. If we head back here (which we must) I want to try the Fettuccine Alfredo!  I can't forget the lovely piano player who started his set halfway through dinner. He took requests and played all genres of music. What a classy touch, Bootlegger!",

My family and I got here early and decided to go in to the bar located in the main restaurant area.  Drinks were pretty good along with our bartender Frank (sorry if I got the name wrong)   He was definitely an A+++ bartender .. very responsive and quick with service and a smile.  While we were sitting there I overheard the couple behind me send back an appetizer of calimari (unsure of the reason so I dont want to speculate) but also the steak was not cooked properly.  My brother had come in the previous night to try out the food and complained about the chicken being super dry.  I think the cook/cooks may have had an off day because the restaurant was packed when we left at 6 to go to our reception.  That many people filling the tables so it can't be all that bad.   The reception food was pretty good as I wasn't really expecting much after the complaints.  The steak however had good flavor but I had to chew and chew and chew..  WOW.. it was defintely fighting back.  The lasagna came in what I can only call a cheese form.  Small squares that held together tightly.  At first I was telling my family that this is kinda weird and spongy but after eating it I realized wow.. this is genius.. Everything in the lasagna stays together as you eat it so you aren't losing anything.   I guess I could compare it to Italian dim sum although it wasn't a dumpling . Great ITALIAN dishes however from what I was hearing a redo on steaks, chicken, and appetizers may be in order.",

    "text": "I first heard about this place because I was watching old episodes of Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown. I knew immediately this would be a place my husband and I would love. I mentioned to Joel I'd like to go there and on a Tuesday he surprised me with an early dinner.   Bootleggers Bistro is located on Las Vegas Blvd and it's been there forever! Since we were there at 3:30 pm on a Tuesday the place was empty. Which was fine with us. No waiting and they still had some excellent tunes from Sinatra to Louie Prima. It's a dimly lit place with a large bar. They also have a small stage with a piano.   Our server was on point and quickly poured out water and handed us menus. Bootleggers has all the Italian classics. Since I can eat very little these days it's become a whole new way of ordering. Joel and I decided to split an appetizer and an entree. We picked the Antipasto plate and the Baked Penne. The food came out super fast. First, the Antipasto plate which was huge! It contained the best marinaded mushrooms, bell peppers, and chickpeas. Plus, it was filled with ham, salami, pepperoni, provolone, and fresh mozzarella. I was in heaven. Then it got better when they brought us out their epically awesome garlic knots and the marinara sauce was seriously life changing!! Our waitress brought out our piping hot Baked Penne. This is one of Joel's favorite Italian items. It's probably the best Baked Penne we've ever had. The ricotta cheese was so sweet and creamy and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  The sauce and meat the mealies in your mouth along with the bites of cheese and pasta.   What an amazing meal! I can't stop thinking about every part of it. I seriously will be back ASAP!! The service rocks, the ambiance is romantic ( even at 3:30pm) and the food is mind blowing!!! For your next date night go here! You'll for sure impress. Bonus, Bootleggers Bistro is open 24 hours!!",

Our waiter Tralan noticed it was their anniversary and slipped me a paper to put my grandparents names on. He gave it to the pianist who announced their anniversary to the restaurant. The pianist then dedicated a song to them and sang it beautifully. The food is always delicious but that special treatment that wasn't expected made their anniversary truly special. The server really does have the ability to make your experience dining out better than you could ever imagine. Tralan was awesome and we are grateful that he was our server on that special night who took notice of something very special to our family.",

When we walked in, there was no one at the reception area. It was dark and confusing... We didn't know where to go so just walked towards the bar. Finally ran into a hostess and was seated shortly after.  Their service was great there. Everyone was super nice. The food came out quickly. I was pleasantly surprised. I got the cheese ravioli with rose sauce. It was good, just not that memorable. I actually enjoyed the garlic bread a lot more than my actual meal.  I'd definitely come here again, especially since it's 24 hours!",

There's a nice bar area and then a large restaurant area complete with old-school Vegas lounge singers during certain times. The atmosphere is just fantastic. Just dark enough, those great curved booths, waiters wearing ties, lots of families and couples, etc.  The bread that each table automatically gets was delicious. Little square bites that were very buttery with some garlic. And served with a great red sauce for dipping (definitely not a marinara).  We opted for pasta dishes, of course. The basic spaghetti with meat sauce and the salmon on a bed of penne pomodoro. I was a bit confused when no sides were offered for the spaghetti (even though it says it comes with one at the top of the menu). And then with the salmon, I was asked if I wanted pasta or a potato. Well, since it is supposed to be a pasta dish, why would I get the pasta? But alas, I didn't question it and didn't say anything when the food arrived - I had no pasta on my plate, just a piece of salmon and a baked potato. Thankfully, the salmon was delicious and cooked perfectly. And while basic, the spaghetti with meat sauce had a good flavor.   The waiter was very nice and checked on us several times. And despite it being packed, we never felt rushed.  This is definitely a place worthy of a repeat visit. Both a great place for a date and to take family visiting from out-of-town.",

When we finished it off he offered more but we declined since we didn't want to fill up on bread. I had signed up for emails online which got me a coupon for free bottle of wine or free appetizer up to $12. We opted for the free app & ordered the 3 bruschetta with tomato & basil. Price was $10 but the coupon still took the full $12 off the bill. I ordered the Pollo Angelo, my husband ordered Linguini alla vongolo (linguine in white clam sauce). Both meals were amazing! After dinner they surprised us with a free dessert for our anniversary! Dessert was 2 mini cannolis, plate was decorated with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate & raspberry sauce. Everything was great. We highly recommend this restaurant, it is our new Vegas favorite!",

We go there about once a month or so just because it's good Italian close to home, but tonight we were there for a celebration.  A dear friend had a milestone birthday, and came to town with friends and family from afar.  We chose Bootlegger for its central location--easy access for people staying on the Strip!  Our meal was just outstanding.  We knew the food and service would be good because they always are, but I guess we're spoiled by being regulars because our friends were just dazzled.  Everyone ordered their favorite things, and we were all blown away by how delicious and gorgeous everything was.  The birthday girl had the magnificent osso buco special.  If you're there and it's available, just get it.  Incredible.  The service was as good as any of the fancy pricy places on the Strip.  Our main server, whose name I can't remember because I had a fair amount of wine but he knows who he is (and so does his boss, I hope!) gave us a first class experience.  He recognized and decanted the wine we brought, and it just felt so fancy and important!  Thank you, Bootlegger, for a night that we all will always treasure!  We'll be back, and we'll bring friends!",

When a crazy craving for a great steak hits you I am glad to know that the Bootlegger is able to deliver 24/7. Although, I do have to go pick it up from the restaurant that is just fine with me.   Last night called in an order for takeout around 2 am, and the phone call to the restaurant was answered prompt. My order was repeated back to me from the restaurant associate. The ordering process over the phone was smooth with no issues. I was told to allow 45 minutes before coming since cooking steak takes a little longer. I was in no hurry so wandered into the Bistro about 3 am and went to the bar area to pick up the order.   The bartender had my order waiting, I gave my card to settle the check. My ordered included the Bootlegger N.Y. Strip which came with mashed potatoes. The intoxicating smell from the bag was so overwhelming. It smelled like heaven! The taste of the steak was even better. I could not of been happier with the service or taste of the food. When that craving comes on I know where to find fantastic food and great service.",

Staff clearly does not know their \"rules\" and received various answers of if my boyfriend and I were allowed to eat here after 11:00pm.  whoever in the front told us it was okay as long as we do not sit at the bar. While the server immediately asked for I.d. before even saying hello or smiling ? So disrespectful and then had to ask whoever else if it was okay for us to eat here. Ignored us for awhile, then returned to the table to say \"that guy doesn't work graveyard so he's wrong. But ill let it slide for tonight.\" Working in the food industry as well as working on the strip I have never had an experience when the employees don't know right and wrong on their own policies.  Server was so rude and disrespectful we left before ever receiving our food.  Being a first time customer I would never recommend this establishment solely for its poor untrained and disrespectful staff and the fact that everyone seems to just make up their own rules. No wonder all their terrible staff work the graveyard!",

Took some friends there for dinner and thought I would try theirs cause I was in the mood for Lasagna.  First few bites were excellent but no meat.  Finally hit a big glob of meat on one side and it was weird tasting.  No sauce and just kinda off,  just sitting on one side in a glob.   Probably won't order Lasagna again but I have been there many times and will continue to frequent the restaurant.  Calamari was excellent as always!  BTW-  we had a great waitress and excellent service as usual!!!",

It's fairly casual in the bar area and lots of seating throughout the restaurant. I've been here dozens of times and will surely be back.   The service is pretty good overall. Service is great during the day but sadly has been kinda bad many times when I visit at 2am. You are usually greeted quickly (except during early morning or using the back door). You are usually served water and any other drinks quick and refilled quick (except during early morning). They almost never get more ice when refilling ice tea though no matter the time, I usually need to ask for more ice and lemon every time. The ice tea is good fresh brew and served in glass cup though. My server tonight, Richard, was good though. He's been here for a decade and is very nice and did great job.   The food is very good and fairly consistant. Deep flavors and lots of flavor. Portions are good but little inconsistent. I always get enough food since the serving sizes are on the bigger side usually but the portion size on the lasagna really depends on the cook. Sometimes I am served a way bigger piece so I suggest they train employees to cut the same size piece, same amount of sauce etc.   The online menu on yelp is a little vague compared to there full menu on their website The early dinner options stop at 5pm. The smaller plates are nice and save me from over stuffing.   Nice decor and lighting. They adjust the lighting and music throughout the day. At night the lights get lower and music is little more upbeat. Lots of tv's to watch. There is a piano player during some days just not late at night. Table clothes, glass cups and plates, and nice silverware is appreciated.   Thanks again to The Bootlegger Italian Bistro and the great severs like Richard. Check them out if you haven't. I'll be back for sure.   Thanks for reading, take care!",

They do have some gaming here if that's your style. Medium sized U shaped bar. A few high top tables off to the side, as well as some booths and tables for dining. Plenty of TV's for viewing sporting events like the Golden Knights game!   After the group showed up it was only a matter of minutes for a table in the bar area to open up. We sat down just as the game started, and it was 1-0 when the garlic knot bread arrived. Waiter took our order after it was 3-0. My friends ordered the pizza, and I ordered the salmone.   It was 4-0 when the food arrived. Pizza takes about 30 minutes to cook. My salmone was absolutely delicious, a grilled chunk of salmon in a creamy buttery lemony sauce, with veggies and salmon ravioli. Oh so good!!!  I will be back just for this meal it was so good.",

It's conveniently open 24/7 and they have live music (which is unfortunately kinda rare these days in this town), by the time I got there the live music had ended and maybe about 3 people were in the place.  The bartender was nice and he greeted us enthusiastically. We decided to do take-out and have a glass of white wine with garlic knots while we waited so we sat at a small table. The server wasn't too attentive, he didn't even crack a smile to greet us. As a Yelper myself, I read these are usually complimentary but we ended up paying for them anyway. We ordered the lasagna and fettuccine alfredo with prawns (which cost $6 each!). Thought it was a little steep but ordered two prawns anyway. If it's delicious food, it's worth the money, I usually say!  Our order was ready in about 5 minutes, which should've been a warning sign. Our wine didn't taste good but we drank it anyway (hate wasting alcohol). Feeling a little rushed we finished as fast as we could and took our meals home.  Once we got home, my lasagna did not look like lasagna (missed a picture on that one). The fettuccine was really bland, we tried adding minced garlic to it and it still didn't help. I don't like to waste food but I couldn't bring myself to finish it. I was so disappointed in this whole experience! I've heard such good things about this place and heard it was even featured on TV!? I hope it goes back to the place it once sounded like bc people in the service industry need more 24 hour places (especially with live music)! Might try it again someday, but will definitely sit at the bar next time. I included a photo of what I came home with and of what it looked like after we fixed it up ourselves... we ended up turning it into pink sauce with a Hunt's tomato paste and it was delicious! Our server also told us they didn't make pink sauce and I've seen plenty of Yelp photos of pasta with pink sauce.",

They literally looked at me, didn't say a word and began talking to each other. No hello, no Ill be right with you, just completely ignored.   We were finally seated after they were done with their conversation. There was a large party of 20-25 people right in the middle of the restaurant. This group was very loud and disturbing the entertainment of the singer and piano player. They should have been sat in the back room so not to disturb the other diners.   Out of our group of 6 only 1 liked their dinner. We had a large pizza, veal parm, NY steak (2) and osso bucco. The pizza was terrible, the osso bucco was like none I had seen before. Very small over cooked pieces of meat instead of a large veal shank. Neither person cared for their steak either. The lava cake for dessert was super rich and not enjoyable.   Not sure what happened to this place. Just a bad night? I hope so but for the prices they charge the food and hospitality did not come close. Will be taking a break from here for a while.",

It's delightfully pleasant, and the music with the singers makes me feel good .  They play anywhere from Sinatra to Mario Lanza and just classic melodies paired with decent Italian dishes.  5 stars all the way- tip them if you enjoy it music.  I've been here a few times, sometimes to host, sometimes just to have a meal to satisfy the big appetite.  Think American portions with a flare of Italian to it.  Here's an example, the little bread knots that come out is drenched in butter, a bit of garlic, but still eat them.  The pappardelle bolognese, thick egg noodles, filled with ground beef, thick red sauce and a very filling dish.  If you're feeling up to you, add a side of meatballs, it's overload, but I've devoured that meal on a hungry night.  This is my favorite dish.  4 stars.  Other times, I have ordered the lasagna, a little different than you traditional layers of pasta.  Individual sized dish, with the lasagna baked into every dish, a massive amounts of cheese and meat.  Can be a bit salty, with a overload of carbs, fats and protein.  3 stars.  I don't recommend their white pinot noir house wine, because didn't go well with my food.  I couldn't finish the glass.  To each's own.  1 star.  Come with great company, enjoy massive amounts of food, not the most authentic Italian taste, but still decent.  If you want to sit in the main room, make sure you make reservations, because it can get pretty packed.  Read their history on their menu, it's a pretty interesting one.",

So we walked in and it just instantly threw me back to the old cocktail style Frank Sinatra singing days. We didn't have a reservation but when we walked in we were lucky enough to get the booth that just opened. I soaked in the atmosphere. There was a handsome man in a tuxedo playing the piano and a pretty blonde lady in a dress I wish I could wear singing along. It was just surreal I was really hoping the food was as good as the atmosphere. Alfredo was our server :-) he was just so friendly and didn't mind that I talked his ear off I was just so excited to be there. We ordered an Old Fashioned for my husband and I ordered the blood orange cosmo... DELICIOUS!!! Just what I needed after a 4 hour ride in the car. We decided to split the Maria's Saltimbocca and thank god we did because even splitting it we each got two pieces and a nice helping of fettuccine Alfredo. Speaking of Alfredo... did I tell you he was an amazing server?!?! He always had a smile on his face and when we had an issue he had no problem fixing it and we laughed about it after. Finally we finished our night with the Creme Brulee... MUAH! Perfect meal for the end of our long weekend. We will defiantly be back... we heard there is a magic night?!?! Yes please!",

    "text": "I will start by saying I used to actually like this place. First off I get seated at what must have been the worst table in the joint. Directly under a dusty ass tv. Last night I went in to have a meal. I was not sure really what I wanted. The waiter really wasn't help at all. If I asked about something his reply was pretty much the same about every dish. \"It's really good\" I asked about wines. Asked if he liked one of the Pinot selections and just felt he was steering me to the most expensive option. Not a big deal really it was kind of expected. I ended up ordering Pollo Francese a chicken dish with mushrooms. At first bite it tastes really good. But as I kept eating it just got worse. The sauce tastes really nice , a little on the salty side but I like my food a bit more salty than most people I believe. I came to find out this dish was more egg batter and breading than it was chicken. I also had to listen to another waiter basically flirting with a female who was dining alone. He offered up personal information about his family/mother that was really inappropriate for a waiter customer conversation. Then proceeded to carry conversation with the woman that was not being received very well. He also decides he needs to lean COMPLETELY OVER MY FOOD!! While changing the channel on the dusty tv. Which I didn't appreciate in the least!! To top all of this off the MEAL MADE ME SICK!! I woke up at about 4am and ended up in the bathroom Vomiting as well asat the same time on the toilet. Definitely I will be calling to talk to the manager about the situation. Needless to say I probably won't be dining here ever again.",

I odered the long-noodle pasta (can't remember the name) and it was delicious! My wife's speghetti and meatball was on point. The sauces were bursting with flavor!  However, the highlight came at the beginning of the meal when we were served a tray of about 16 pieces of fluffy little biscuits that we all gorged on! Full of butter and garlic,  we requested a second tray even before our meals got there. Who can say no to more free bread...right? We got so full, we couldn't even get dessert.   If you've seen this place numerous times and kept on driving by, stop! It'll be worth your time.",

The only down side was we ordered ribeyes, one medium and one medium rare and both were pretty rare, still had a nice taste but rare.  They didnt care for the mashed potatoes because it tasted like there was too much milk.  Wait staff is spot on...even at 10pm.  Love the old photos, nice atmosphere.  Right next to the outlet mall which is even better.  Loved the live music, it made dinner even more enjoyable.  Keep up the good work!!",

After waiting sooo long we told the busser to tell the waiter to cancel but he brought it out anyways after the rest of us finished eating. The bolognese had a lot of cream in it (a little milk yes but cream).  The waiter said the chef was going to give us a dessert for free I guess because the delay.  Not once did our waiter apologize.  We will never come back here.  What a waste of over a hundred dollars for three and a bad Christmas Day meal.",

We asked him what is good on the menu & he gave us several suggestions ... It was apparent he was very aware of everything on the Bootleggers Menu. We ended up playing the safe route and went with the classic spaghetti!! Amazing, Roman had told us that the meatballs were some of the best in town & he was not wrong.

The small amount of sauce that was served on the plate was so plain and it had no flavor, it tasted like plain tomato sauce dumped from a can.   I sent my order back to the kitchen. My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs, he didn't finish all of the meal and that was a good thing, because when he got home he became real ill.

Glad you're so busy, but I'd tell any potential new customers to stay so far from this uninspiring dinning experience.",

We sat in a booth and were entertained by a wonderful singing pianist. The mood of the room was retro Las Vegas. Our server, Steven, was a real pro and added to the dining experience. We also loved reading about the history of the founding family and the creation of this restaurant and its tradition of great Italian cooking. These timeless family restaurants are very special to me. Cocktails were large and well made and there is a large cocktail list with interesting original drinks. My wife and I shared a Caesar salad, and had as our entrees fettucini Bolognese and veal sorrentino, both recommended by our server. The veal dish was prepared rollatini style, and was a creation of the restaurant's executive chef, 98 y/o Maria. It was awesome!!!!! Very extensive wine list and we enjoyed a bottle of pinot grigio while being entertained by the pianist. Prices are very reasonable, quality is high, and we just loved it there.",

    "text": "I find this restaurant utterly intriguing in theory. It is a 24 hour establishment known for its \"old-style Vegas\" vibe. There's not much of that sort of thing going on out here, so I was game.  Booze and the promise of good \"red sauce\" Italian-American eats (plus a Groupon) brought me to the Bootlegger late the other night. Overall, I think this is a solid 3.5 star place.  The hot, fresh garlic bread was a hit. I thought the red sauce served along side was just a tad thin and missing an ingredient or two. Not a bad base sauce, but not bursting with flavor. The bread was a perfect accompaniment to the big ol' cocktails we started off with.  Our hot Antipasto appetizer came out very quickly, was nicely presented and of a good size for two. I truly enjoyed the toasted meat ravioli (but again with the lackluster side dish of red sauce) and wished there had been more of that and less of the other two selections. The calamari was just okay. The shrimp scampi was rubbery and really didn't have any taste at all despite the pool of buttery sauce. I don't quite understand how scampi sauce can not taste like anything- it's garlic and butter! Two of my favorite things, together in a bowl. I could not taste any garlic nor butter. I really wonder what's in that sauce; it could have been yellow water for all I know. I took a bite of one shrimp and let my less discriminating husband polish off the rest of it.   For our entrees, we both had veal scalloppini with fettucini alfredo. The veal medallions were tender and tasty, with sauteed mushrooms mixed in. I got the impression that the sauce from the veal was a slightly modified version of the alfredo sauce on the (nicely al dente) pasta. There was very little distinction of the flavors, though both sauces were passably good (better than the red, for sure). Maybe a little bit of salt and definitely some fresh grated parmesan would have set the dish off. The portion size was just right and left us with just enough room to share an outstanding and large slice of tiramisu.   The staff and service were fine, not over the top, but attentive/friendly enough for me. I did like the dark, fairly romantic atmosphere and oversized leather booths. The Bootlegger reminded me a lot of some of my old Italian spots in New York, which is nice. The meal felt expensive, even with the Groupon, so I don't know how often I'd make a special trip for these hit-or-miss eats, but it's always handy to know about an extra late night choice.",

That appeals to me because I get off work at 3am and sometimes I would like a nice dinner before heading home.  As soon as I'm seated a wait staffer comes over fills my water glass and takes my drink order.  30 Seconds later the garlic bites come to the table and they are good!  They have a nice menu with lots to choose from.  Nothing crazy this time so I ordered the chicken parm with angel hair pasta light sauce.  My dinner came out with no sauce on it at all.  That's an easy fix and the waiter was prompt to get the sauce to me on the side.  The Chicken was well cooked and the angel hair was perfect.  All and all a good experience very friendly staff and the place was clean.  The fact that I have full menu options at anytime of the night I will be back for sure.",

    "text": "It is with pleasure that I write this first review. On a Sunday night, my friends and I attempted to find quality Italian food and found the Bootlegger Bistro sitting in a loud corner of not much else. The atmosphere was dark and the music all over the place. At one point they started to play 90's rock after getting tired of playing the same jazz hit 5 times in an hour. The service was lacking. The waitress seemed to have forgotten us much of the time and sitting there, we distinctly thought we could smell a waft of the good old ganja. She seemed really happy anyway...  Vic called for the Bootlegger Hot Mixed Antipasti. Bland. The Toasted Ravioli might as well have been slightly stale pasta flavored Playdough with very basic marinara used for everything that night. The House Specialty Shrimp wasn't exactly special. Though the calamari was not bad. Not over cooked and normal enough to be edible.  I ordered Manicotti Infornati because I love ricotta wrapped in pasta and served with marinara, but I found that the ricotta was underwhelming and the marinara was lacking in herbs. My main course was overall a thorough disappointment considering that the plates were priced a little heavier than I like. (I like inexpensive. Inexpensive is the joy of students).   We waffled back and forth on dessert and in the end, we succumbed to our dark love of sweets. One was a Cannoli that had a strong taste of orange liqueur. Maybe Grand Marnier. The liqueur taste was strong, but for once, I was pleased and even infatuated with it. But that's if you're an orange flavor lover like me. The moment of sheer beauty and bliss however, was our Tiramisu. Absolutely fantastic and the reason why this restaurant has 3 stars. There was a distinct flavor of alcohol, but it was superbly balanced with the sweetness and that richness that is Tiramisu. It was in a word: transcendent. I have never found Tiramisu to be an appealing dessert till now, but every time I near Vegas, that will be one of the highlights of all my trips. The Tiramisu.  It's actually 2.5 for the price range.  V reminded me: the either discriminated against us for either age or race (not sure which) because the hospitality was definitely lacking with only our table as the host floated from diner to diner except our group and shook hands with everyone as they left except for us.",

We walked inside and I wasn't inspired by the large velvet/velour curtains. We were sat at an uninspiring square table right next to the aisles. Our waiter was kind but not very pleasant. I ordered a Riesling. It was a wee bit sour. I ordered Insalata Pomadora...it was AMAZING. I also ordered Capallini Pomodora (w/ pesto grilled chicken-ala carte)...also AMAZING. My hubby ordered Insalata Casa-however, he preferred my salad & Chicken Parm~ he loved that. Now, The food was pretty much amazing.  There was a 'lovely' ancient basement smell to the place. The linens were LESS than fresh. They smelled like they were stored in an old ancient basement. WE felt no need or reason to hang around. The piano player was \"eh\"... The waiter rarely spoke to us... But did his job. Maybe if he knew it was our anniversary we would have gotten a better table or something that would have made me decide to give another star.",

Food is good --traditional Italian restaurant like many you'd find in New York neighborhoods (that is meant as a compliment!)  Pasta, baked pasta (like eggplant parm), chicken and veal (sorrento, franchese etc. etc.)  In fact all the usual suspects at prices much lower than you'll find on the Strip.    Don't know why it is called \"bistro\" there is nothing bistro or French about it.  Bootlegger sticks with the \"Old style\" with pianist and general atmosphere reminiscent of the \"good\" old days.   Room is darkish, ornate in that Little Italy style and has a largish bar.  Walls adorned with pics. of honored grandparents who started a restaurant when Vegas was more than a little different than today's mega-hotels and Disney-land casinos.  Not for hipsters or people who like \"adventurous\" food--but good if you want a meal that is familiar, good and inexpensive.  Service is prompt and professional and wait staff are experienced.  It is close by one of the outlet shopping centers and is open 24 hours a day--which seems odd--but there you are.",

Decided to sit at the bar and met the awesome bartender Fred. He is full of awesomeness and can make someone feel at home. Split the dinner lasagna and I gotta tell you its the beat I have ever had. Soft. Moist. Cheesy and the best part... It is not heavy. As light as a lasagna can be. We also tried the mozarella sticks. Let me tell you. Not that frozen crap. I took a bite and it was heaven. For desert I got the canoli. With a hint or orange and not too sweet chocolate it was awesome! All in all I will be back at least 2 times a month. Oh don't forget to try their bread. It's a party in every bite. Just remember to add 5-15 minutes of cardio to your workouts after. This not for calorie watchers. Go see Fred and have him guide you through Italy in LV!",

Yes they where,.....\"Oh great, can we sit on the patio?\"  Finally a nice day in vegas where sitting on the patio was a good idea, well not that day because he never told the waitress she had customers outside, finally we go back in and she comes out. After placing our order and waiting a long time for our food, she never checked up on us and our food was very mediocre.

    "text": "What a disappointment! Maybe this review is biased but I'll tell you why and let you take it into consideration. Las Vegas is my hometown, I moved away several years ago but my family is still there and I return a few times a year. After my father sold his restaurant my family would go to the Bootlegger Restaurant when it was located on Eastern Avenue. I always enjoyed their food. That location closed and they are now the Bootlegger Bistro on the south strip. The first time I went there it was for lunch on a Saturday with the entire family....my sister and her kids, my brother with his wife and kids and myself. We were all seated in a party room but they never told us that the \"sisters\" would be rehearsing their lounge show singing act. It was loud and they couldn't sing very well, not a good experience. My brother apologized because he highly recommended this place and said their food was worth it. The food was pretty good still but listening to the sisters still gets a laugh when ever I bring it up. We've had other meals at the Bistro over the years and seemed to be going down hill over the years until the last time.   When my (then) girl friend and I decided to return to our hometown and get married last January we settled on having the reception at the Bootlegger Bistro, not only because my family had been meeting there for years but because one of the part owners was a high school friend of both of ours. On the night of our reception the service was rushed and rude at the begining when they were serving drinks. At one point my wife was standing in the way of one of the servers while serving a drink and the drink ended up on my wife's wedding dress. The server looked at her like it was her fault for not getting out of her way. The food took forever to be served, I think it was because the drinks were seperate and they were trying to make more money out of my guests. We finally got served. I had the Seafood Fra Diavlo. I only got half way through my meal and had to run to the bathroom. Later I heard that others had the same symptoms, needless to say it wasn't a good experience on my wedding night and for a few days after. Because they were late in serving dinner they rushed into clearing the dinner plates before people were done eating. Maybe that was a good thing.   The part owner of the Bistro was also a friend of a few of our guests so when we arrived we all asked if Ron was there. We was there but after waiting to see him all evening he couldn't pry himself away from his band and recording studio to say hello to his old friends. I dropped over $1000 in his restaurant, got sick in his bathroom and he didn't have the common courtesy to say hello. I held off on writing this review because I didn't want to write angry. It's been almost 10 months and I can't wait anymore. I'm Italian and I guess some things I won't get over. If you are thinking about having you're special dinner at this place be warned.....they don't care about anything but your money.",

Very nice family atmosphere, we love the service and quality of the food.  My husband works in the 5 diamond food service industry,  so our expectations are high, since he has to be perfect at his job we expect the same; especially since we don't mind spending a lot of money on dining if it's worth it.  The food here is reasonable in it's pricing, dinner for 4 depending on what you order will run about 100$ But keep in mind, you will have food to bring home because the portions are huge and you will have enough for lunch the next day.  We look forward to having Miguel bring us drinks and tell us what he recommends and it's nice that he always remembers us, Miguel always makes us feel welcomed.",

We drive up and walked into a huge building with lots of old school Italian pictures, a dummy sitting behind the counter, literally a dummy. ;) Then this nice girl asked if she could help us. We had reservations...which I highly recommend because they are always super busy.  The bar was to the right and a very nice dining area to the left. We were sat at a table, nice ambience (until the screaming began in the bar...Sunday football season...not a time to go if you are looking for a nice quiet or romantic dinner)  but then it finally died down and we could hear the great music playing. My man ordered the Oso Bucco and I ordered the Bolognese which was served on wide egg noodles...which I have never had before but have always wanted to try...omg!!! So glad I did. The flavor was out of this world. Pieces of pancetta and ground chuck...which is the only ground I get when I cook! It was thick and made with so much love...even though my stomach said enough...I couldn't stop! We ordered Caesar salads to start...and some yummy rolls with marinara sauce. Everything was fresh and packed full of flavor. The man liked his Oso Bucco but after trying mine...he was hooked. I also ordered a side of sausage...homemade sausage!!! Yum! At about 6pm there was a piano player that came in to the dining room to entertain everyone...even though we were stuffed to the gills...we ordered dessert so we could stay and listen to him play. I had the creme brulee and the man had the chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream!! We have decided that we need to make this our every other Sunday night dinner location!  So glad we finally made it!!!",

I always thought my favorite food was Italian but being that I am not Italian myself when I heard that it was authentic I wondered if I had been eating Italian food with an American twist this whole time and wondered if I would enjoy the meal and all it's authenticity.  Once I actually started to eat what I noticed was the difference between the food at this restaurant compared to the places I've always gone to was this restaurants food was very filling quickly (a great thing in my opinion you are not left needing more, completely satisfied)  And the other was that the taste was so flavorful yet pure no overbearing salt or anything like that. (I love flavor it had plenty just no salty after taste which again great)  The waiter we had was so wonderful he prepared our food right at the table just to make our experience extra special. He spoke so highly of the restaurant and expressed how proud he was to represent it (which he did such a wonderful job doing)  He laughed, he joked, he wasn't overbearing yet very personable. All around the experience was just as great as I always heard it would be. This place has been around a long time and I've heard nothing but wonderful things from different people and now I can agree, if you like great service and authentic good tasting Italian food than this is your spot!   -another note the prices were reasonable and they had some great meals like the Steak and Shrimp which actually comes with Steak Shrimp Scampi Broccoli and Fettuccine Alfredo for (32) it was shared and we still took some home!   Great spot!",

We started with the calamari and both of us thought it was better than most! I had Maria's Saltimbocca. Very rich but very delicious! My fiance had chicken parmesan and really liked his as well.

I got a pizza with a hard glob of what appeared to be microwaved cheese on top, and instead of sauce, I got awkward pockets of herbs under the oppressive glob that were awkwardly distributed, keeping me constantly on the edge of my seat: \"Will this bite be cardboard and cheese? Or will I get 20 flavors at once in one hidden clump?\" I went a couple days ago, and I still get a bit sick to my stomach when I think about it.   The marinara they dropped off with the sad-looking bread pieces at the start of the meal was also completely watery. The ambiance was nice and the service was attentive, but I could never, ever return for that food. So disappointed.",

My husband ordered the Spinach Alfredo primavera. He was disappointed. It really didn't look very appetizing.

    "text": "In the two years that I've lived in the Vegas area, I've frequently heard good things about this place -- mostly along the lines of it being a very good, old-school Italian restaurant & having live music most (if not all) evenings.  I FINALLY got there last night, for dinner with a friend.     While the owners & I guess the recipes go back 60+ years, their current location is basically in a modern strip-mall complex along Las Vegas Blvd.  They have a small outdoor seating section, which actually would be a lot of fun on a nice day or night, but we opted to sit inside on our first visit, to get a better few for everything.  We arrived at about 6:30PM on a Thursday, easily found parking by the front door, and were promptly seated (no reservation).  The interior is pretty nice -- lots of old photos of the family on the wall, a nice looking bar section, and then a couple dining sections.  We were seated in what was probably the main seating area, since it was where the small stage with a Baby Grand piano was.  Ambience was pretty classic -- dark red tablecloths, red walls, etc. while customer attire ran the gamut.  I was there in jeans & a t-shirt, some groups were semi-formally dressed, and one table had people in shorts & a t-shirt.   I don't think the management really minds much, however now that I know what the place is like, I would not personally feel comfortable just wearing shorts, a t-shirt & sandals.   This was a spur of the moment dining location for me, & while I wouldn't feel uncomfortable going back in casual attire, if I know I'm headed there, I'll at least wear a nice shirt, but even with that, the staff is still dressed nicer than at least 50% of the clientele.  All the staff was very friendly & professional -- shortly after we were seated, we were offered ice water.  Our drink order was taken when the menus were delivered, and pretty much as soon as we were ready to order, the waiter was there to take it.   Right after our order was placed, we received a gratis appetizer of 'garlic bread balls' & marinara dipping sauce -- good stuff!  My friend ordered meat lasagna, and I (a vegetarian) ordered a side salad, and spaghetti marinara.  My salad arrived within about 5 minutes, and was very good, albeit nothing too special or elaborate.   About this time, a young woman, accompanied by a pianist, started signing.  It was a nice touch, but not too loud to prevent a conversation at our table.  About 15- 20 minutes after we placed our order, or entrees arrived, and we were both offered Parmesan cheese added to the top.    My friend said his lasagna was very good, and I know my spaghetti was too.   Spaghetti with marinara sauce & Parmesan cheese sprinkles is pretty basic of course -- as a hapless bachelor type, spaghetti with marinara sauce is one of the few meals I can actually make at home  -- but their marinara sauce is clearly something freshly made & the result of True, old-school Italian family tradition -- you won't find that sort of flavor in a can or jar at the grocery store...  Quantity of both my pasta & my friend's lasagna was good.  By no means was it 'family-style,' nor did we have any leftovers, but the portions were enough for two good-sized adult males to fill their bellies.  It AMAZES me to think that this place is open 24/7!   I'd live to get there at 2 or 4AM sometime, just to see how if it's still a classy-casual kind of place.    I expect the late night/early morning operation is subsidized by video poker machines (& players) at the bar.  My one & only complaint?   The prices.   Call me a cheapskate -- it's very True that as someone who lives in the LV area who likes dining-out, I need to be careful with my meal budget.  But I also know that for $15 or less at some casino buffets, I can get my fill of a large variety of decent food plus a drink.  That fact is always in the back of my mind, though I am not trying to compare a relatively cheap casino buffet to a meal experience at a very nice, old-school Italian place with linen napkins & waiters wearing suits & ties.  $16 for a plate of spaghetti marinara?  Well, I'll reluctantly say OK to that, but only because of the overall ambience plus live music.  $3 for my iced tea (free refills)? I can live with that.   But I was surprised to see that my tasty but nothing-extraordinary side salad was $8.   In my experience, at many comparable places, that salad would have been included in the price of the entree.  This place is not some touristy place on The Strip that can get away with charging a lot simply because tourists have been programmed to expect to pay a lot while in the LV area for vacation.  It's almost like there's a surcharge for wanting to eat healthy...   Our stomaches were pleasantly full so we passed on desert this time.  I absolutely do expect to be back -- curiosity may have me stop by if I'm hungry & in the area at 3AM one of these days, or if I'm on a somewhat casual date, it's a nice lunch or dinner option.",

Tbe kicker was when the waitress asked how her meal was we told her she didn't like it. While she offered another pasta bowl. My daughter is unable to eat anything with dairy. So she told okay well, I'll pack it up for you to eat later. Really??? She didnt like it now. What males you think she's going to eat it later. Long story short we wont be back cost $50 for 1 adult and 2 children. And I only had the house salad.",

Options are something along the lines of \"bud, bud light, miller, milllllaaaarrr, whomp, whomp whommmpp....\" I was lost some where between the Micaloab River and Coors Island. If I were drinking beer tonight, my 96% of the time booze choice, I would have did a 180 and not let the door hit my butt. That being said, don't underestimate a snob's affection for a craft brew.

This is a very solid Italian spot.  The atmosphere at dinner is low lit, warm, and welcoming with the piano bar and music.  Service is fast and has an old vegas / \"home cooked meal\" feel to it.  Prices are fair, especially for the quality and serving sizes.    We have been here quite a few times, and try to order different things each time.  We have had the mussels/pasta, lasagna, ravioli, etc etc and all have been great tasting and an excellent night out.  Although I have recently found a new favorite Italian spot to frequent, Bootleggers is a very solid choice especially if you are on this neck of the woods!  Definitely give it a go!",

I had to order another dish from the bar menu due to the skimpy portions and come to find out the bar portion which is supposed to be half the size looks bigger than the dinner portion off the regular menu. Once the bartender dude glanced at my phone and saw my two star review he avoided me like the plague; I had to ask the runner for more garlic bread, hence the downgrade to one star. I spent 50 dollars for pasta and one beer and wasn't nearly full or satisfied one bit. Next time, I'll go where they serve family style portions.",

    "text": "My family and I have been in attendance at this restaurant for the past 3 years for Christmas dinner. It's become somewhat of a tradition but after our experience this past Christmas we will not be returning next year.   We arrived at 3:55 pm for a 4:00 pm reservation and we were not seated until 4:20 pm which was a bit annoying especially with 2 small children eagerly awaiting their dinner. Once seated our drink order was taken and served relatively quickly. We waited another 15 minutes before we saw our waiter again to take our meal order, then another 10 minutes to receive the bread and marinara dipping sauce. This was always my family's favorite part of the meal in previous years, however this time the \"marinara\" sauce was poorly seasoned and watery. A major disappointment. We shared a caprese salad for an appetizer that was decent. For our meals we ordered Osso Buco, chicken parmesean, bolognese, and MEAT ravioli. Now I emphasize meat ravioli because this is where the major service concern lies. The initial ravioli that was served was cheese ravioli, not what we ordered. After bringing this to the waiter's attention he apologized and quickly returned with a replacement serving of ravioli, once again it was cheese ravioli and not the meat ravioli that was ordered. Another 10 minutes elapse and finally the 3rd plate of ravioli comes out but alas the meat inside the ravioli is stone cold. Once management is notified they apologize profusely and offer to fix it but at this time we are so turned off by this repeated display of poor service that we simply forego the ravioli altogether. Management did not charge us for the ravioli and they gave a 30% discount off of the entire bill and a free dessert. While their attempts to remedy the experience is appreciated we have decided not to patronize this establishment in the future as you only get one Christmas dinner a year and this time The Bootlegger failed to meet our expectations.",

I had my camera out and was taking pictures of my man when our server asked if we wanted a photo together, mind you we wernt dressed to impress so I  said no, any girl would we looked like shit. Our server nearly insulted us by assuming we were \"hiding\" or \"cheaters\" when we didn't want a photo and kinda chucked away. WTF. Anyways to food and drink.  Drinks: BF-MAKERS OLDFASHION (just ok, think they added sugar?!)               ME-MAKERS MANHATTAN UP (delicious)  APS: CALAMARI- very nice           EGGPLANT FRITTI- Love eggplant but breading on it sucks.           MUSSELLS DIAVALO- eh. Not good. Too much tomato sauce.  They served the same marinara sauce with the bread( which was good), the calamari, the eggplant fritti, and I swear they just dumped the same sauce over the mussells and heated it.  We wern't going to get an entree but I was still hungry and we didn't have anything to cook at home so I got a pasta.   PASTA: BUCATINI W PANCETTA, PEAS, AND CARBONARA-not bad. Hey I am no aficionadoon pasta but I didnt think that the bucatini was a right choice for this pasta, I meant a bucatini would hold a chunky meat sauce so much better than a no so thick carbonara. Overall it was yum, I took it home to finish:)  Probably not going to give it another whirl, I am not a food snob I just know whats good and what I like. I dont discourage others to eat here, there are tons of people I know who love this place, for me its just not my style. CIAO",

The drinks were good, but getting a refill on my water glass was a real chore. I will not be going back!",

Being that I am Italian and from Chicago, where good Italian food is plentiful, I was having a hard time finding Italian food in Vegas to my liking.  This place fit the bill.  This isn't fancy-schmancy high-brow Italian food like you will encounter on the Strip.  So if you are expecting that you will be disappointed here.  This place serves what some would call \"red sauce\" Italian food, which is a term I don't like.  What it is, is good, old-fashioned Italian food like so many Italian mothers would make. (My mom's food is still better though)  The prices are reasonable, they sometimes have live entertainment, the service is good, and I have not had one bad meal here.",

We drove past the turn to the rental car return and saw that the Bootlegger served 24/7, so we stopped in. We had eaten a fabulous dinner at the Bootlegger on a previous trip to Vegas and had no idea that they served breakfast. Well, I have to say that the food was absolutely outstanding. Our young server could not have been more attentive and helpful. My wife had the omelet with mushrooms,  spinach and onion. The plate came with fried potatoes and Italian toasted bread for $11.00. She also had a side of bacon for $3.00. I had the Ciabatta French Toast with a side of bacon for $10.00. I could not have been happier with our last meal in Vegas.  WHAT A FIND! If you are out in this area, I highly recommend the Bootlegger for breakfast. Their dinners are of course some of the best and most reasonable in town. Thanks for a great surprise!!!",

The bar has some great staff,  drinks are standard, service is a little slow on certain peoples shifts but personalities make up for it.  Food is excellent, the minestrone is great, my husband and I have been in there many times, with and without each other. The appetizer list is excellent cant go wrong with any of them. Veal Saltimboca is excellent, melt in your mouth. Garlic bread type will only be brought to table after you place your food order, I guess the owner wants the servers to bump up the checks with appetizers. Hit or miss on servers, Danny, Charlene, Elly and Melissa are great. We have had 2 bad experiences with Kevin, he gives off the impression that we are doing him a favor by having him be our waiter, they need to replace him.  Refills are a little slow,and its either too hot or too cold in there, no balance. But the machines are always paying. So overall not a bad place. Great location.",

My friend got the breakfast pizza which was \"featured on the Food Network\" according to our bartender, but it literally just tasted like scrambled eggs on a piece of cheese pizza. Interesting, but i'll stick with the pasta! One advantage that Vegas definitely has over my years in California is the late-night tipsy food spots. No more begging cab drivers to take me through a jack in the box drive-thru.....well maybe once in awhile. But baked penne in a classy joint beats curly fries in a taxi anyday!",

I like the Panetti bread that they serve, especially after a late night and cocktails!  I am a consistent cat, and always get the same item; the sauteed Italian greens, they are always, always amazing and prepared fresh.    I like the old mafia vibe while dining, and the staff is super friendly and always willing to accommodate, this place reminds me of the east coast in a good small town way.    It is a lovely casual bar, I am always happily surprised at the friends I run into there.    Major drawback, they don't have avocado? w.t.f., I like salad.  I have also only been here between 2am-6am, so graveyard is obviously when I recommend for, I can't speak for the regular people hours of operation.",

My friend and I shared the caprese, made with buffalo mozzerella, just divine, and the others had the stuffed mushrooms.  I am not a fan of mushrooms, but they had nothing but wonderful things to say.  They have a pretty great early bird special that the group took advantage of.  By the way, if you order soup, don't expect a little cup.  You get a large bowl of delicious minestrone.  After that and appetizers, it's almost impossible to complete your meal.  I had the capellini, which is great fresh and great microwaved.  The rest of the group had eggplant parmesan and spaghetti, meat lasagna and spaghetti, and this chicken and mushroom with fettucine plate.  Everyone was full and happy with their choices.

I am a fan of as well and would visit this restaurant again. This was one of the restaurants we found that was open late hours and when you are in Vegas, partaking in Vegas activities, late dining will occur.   When we drove into the parking lot, the restaurant had curb appeal and we were happy we found a descent place. Once you go in, the inside decor and ambiance was very different from what the outside appearance will have you believe. First, not sure if it was because it was  late, but when we enter the bar area, it was dark. It was really dark. Reminded me of some secret hiding place one will arrange to meet up. Like an old mafia style movie.   Our waiter was the bartender so service was a little bit slow. But his personality and attentiveness made up for his slowness.   The menu has typical Italian meals and is decently priced. The food was good. I ordered the lasagna and although I have tasted some delicious lasagna, I can say it was decent, filled with seasoned meat and flavorful red sauce. Mama would be proud!   I will definitely eat again at this restaurant and recommend it to anyone looking for a late night dinner in Vegas.",

I would recommend reserving a table because it does get crowded & there's no way to guaranty seating... Especially if with a large group. The food is great, I love the food :) I wonder however why the sauce brought out with the bread is so thin....Anyway, the only REAL issue I have with the place is the restaurant host in the front can be rude.... Wouldn't kill them to say hello or smile!! Overall the atmosphere is nice...  Great for a date or a night out off the strip. AND its 24hrs!! Its a great place",

    "text": "I was sadly disappointed with our whole experience at eating here tonight! From the moment we walked in, the greeter was on the phone and made no attempt to acknowledge me and my husband. When she hung up, she started fidgeting with her pen and immediately took another call. When she finally did greet us, she immediately sat us at the tables in the bar area, despite the restaurant not being very busy. My husband and I ordered ice tea which was very weak. How do you screw up brewing ice tea? We ordered calamari as an appetizer which was pretty good. For the main course, I ordered the penne pasta and my husband ordered a pizza. We were both disappointed with our meals, as his pizza was doughy and undercooked. My penne pasta was bland and every mouthful tasted like watered down ricotta cheese. The service was poor and the quality of food was disappointing.  Our overall bill was $57, which seems high for an okay calamari, weak ice tea, doughy and undercooked pizza and bland penne pasta. We definitely won't be returning!",

    "text": "Wow.  And not in a good way.  I was very disappointed after reading several reviews on how amazing the food is and how great the service is.  I stopped in for lunch on Sunday and was greeted by this mannequin that holds a sign.  It said to seat myself.   I sat myself.  After a few minutes someone came with menus.  The menu is 8 pages long and has the old school feel to it.  I just watched Bourdain scour the Italian countryside eating pasta, so I ordered a vegetable plate and some fettuccine Alfredo.  I was really excited.  I was.  The appetizer arrived after about 12 minutes with fried ravioli and some grilled veggies.  They were soggy and the mushroom cap was leaving that grey water on the plate.  Not bad, but not good either.  The ravioli was okay, but not to die for.  We waited another 10 minutes for our pasta - vegetable lasagna with alfredo sauce and my fettuccine.    Vegetable lasagna, dear readers, isn't just broccoli sandwiched between layers of pasta and swimming in sauce.  There are other vegetables out there, like eggplant, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions...I could go on and on.  The lasagna was sad.  I mean it literally looked like it was crying on the plate.  My alfredo was sandy, and when I say that I mean the sauce had grit in it that grinded like sand between my teeth.  I stopped halfway through in fear of digesting alien fragments.    We did not get the bread that was supposed to come with our meal, either.  I paid over $50 for lunch to eat crap.  I was very disappointed, felt like I was raped of my money, and honestly did not have the best time in the restroom that evening.  Needless to say I will never EVER returrn here again.  God willing.",

We ordered Martini's and a bottle of Pellegrino. The Garlic Rolls arrived before our drinks! Our server, Alfredo (yes that's his real name) was prompt and very helpful! We started with Bruschetta and a side of meatballs. The Bruschetta was fresh and delicious and the Meatballs were the best I've ever eaten!! They were moist and bursting with flavor!! We then ordered salads Caesar and Caprese. Fresh and delicious!! We also ordered a bottle of Bongiovanni Barolo, which Alfredo suggested decanting (Good Call because it had sediment). It was Amazing and paired nicely with our entrees - Lasagna and Seafood Pasta. The Lasagna was the best I've ever had and the Seafood Pasta was packed full of Calamari, Scallops, Shrimp and Crab. My only complaint is the shrimp was slightly over cooked. For dessert we ordered the Cannoli - to die for!! I also wanted to mention the piano player. I didn't get his name but he had a great voice and was a dead ringer for Sinatra! I requested Tom Jones but he didn't know any of his songs and he said he would learn for our next visit.",

    "text": "Meh. We went there for dinner based on the great Yelp reviews. Looked up the menu online before we went, and a window popped up inviting me to join their VIP club and get a free entree or bottle of house wine with purchase of two entrees. Great, I signed up. When we walked in it smelled funky, like they'd recently had a flood and the carpet didn't dry thoroughly. It wasn't immediately apparent where to go, the door we used entered into the bar. We located the front desk and as we approached it a server walked by and said \"Have a nice evening!\" We said \"We actually need to be seated\". Another guy in a suit who was walking away turned around and came back. I said \"Hi, two for dinner\" he said \"Reservation?\" I replied no. He grabbed 2 menus and gestured for us to follow him. Based on that welcome alone we should have just left. He seated us, dropped the menus and left. Our server, Shawn, came up promptly. He was very friendly and made some suggestions. I told him I had a VIP club coupon for wine that was emailed to me and he said \"Oh, you have to print that on paper and bring it in\" What?? I said \"You can't take the info off of my phone?\" He said no. Who the hell requires printed coupons anymore? I saw a show at Mandalay the night before without printed tickets! We ordered a wedge salad that was $14. It was good, but certainly not worth $14, it was pretty small. I ordered Chicken Picatta, husband ordered Chicken Marsala. Both came with Fettuccine Alfredo. When the plates came the chicken was in 3-4 small pieces, like they pounded a few chicken tenders and sauteed them. My picatta had very little if any lemon flavor. My husband said his Marsala was okay. At $23 per entree they were reasonably priced had they been great. The alfredo sauce was all pooled under the fettuccine, it didn't have enough body to cling to the noodles. The highlight of the meal were the small garlic rolls with marinara sauce they brought shortly after we sat down. We were talking to some local people we met the next day and they recommended going to Nora's or Capo's for Italian. Next time.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews, I decided to have dinner at the infamous \"Bootlegger Bistro\". This place let me down. I was completely disappointed.  NEVER AGAIN!!! Trust this review.   For starters, the bread was good, but the marinara was terribly oily. I couldn't even dip the bread in the marinara, without my bread being drenched in oil.   I ordered salmon Alfredo, with a side Caesar salad. The ceasar salad was good and fresh. Upon receiving my main food, I noticed it was a shrimp dish with pasta, which was COMPLETELY different from what I ordered.   The server Stephen (who was really nice) advised me to keep my order, as the chef was preparing a fresh piece of salmon for me. Although I was upset about getting a completely different order, I had faith that Stephen would deliver.  As I ate the shrimp dish, I discovered that it was actually shrimp scampi (shrimp sauteed with garlic in butter, olive oil, and white wine and parsley over pasta) and not a creamy sauce like Alfredo is. So, for my server to replace the shrimp with salmon and leave the pasta, would have been pointless. I advised Stephen and he advised he would bring me salmon Alfredo.   After receiving the dish, let me tell you....the salmon was seasoned and cooked to perfection and was pure deliciousness!!! . The alfredo on the other hand was NASTY!!!! It lacked flavor, was gluey, watery and tasted like it was out of a can. Uggghhhhh!!! Worst I ever had.   I advised Stephen. Stephen apologized, bought the bill and advised he couldn't do anything about the dish, but took off my Caesar salad. At this time, I noticed the price of the shrimp dish was more than the salmon Alfredo, which is what he charged me for. I informed Stephen that I was charged more than what the I initially ordered. Stephen said, \"The shrimp dish and salmon is the same price. The bill is still correct.\" I paid the bill and left the resturant. As I pulled out of the parking lot, I felt conflicted about what Stephen told me. I parked and walked back into the resturant and checked the price. I noticed I was charged more than what I had originally ordered. REALLY????? Stephen over charged me for my meal....and was too lazy and incompetent to charge me for the actual meal they F'd up!!!!!   I advised the manager on duty, Roman who was completely unprofessional. I WILL NEVER eat here again. What a waste of money. If you want good Italian food, go to maggiano's or Giada's at the Cromwell.",

I couldn't find shrimp parmigiana on the menu, I asked the waiter if they had it and he went somewhere and came back and said they had \"fresh\" shrimp and they would make it for me. Wonderful I thought. My husband ordered chicken parmigiana, we split a large Caesar salad, which by the way tasted like vinegar.  And two glasses of Chianti. Our dinners arrived and I asked for some cheese, the  waiter took awhile getting the cheese and finally came back. My husbands chicken was burnt on the bottom, I cut into  my shrimp parmigiana and it wasn't breaded,  it looked like they put the shrimp from the shrimp cocktail on a plate, covered it with mozzarella and sauce, then served it to me. I tried  to eat it but the shrimp was tough from being cooked twice. I told the waiter my problem and we never saw him again until we asked for the check. Check was $96.00.  We paid $32.00 for 3 pieces of Shrimp cocktail covered with sauce(?) and mozzarella.  I don't mind paying for good food and service. We will never come here again or recommend this place to anyone.  I'll make my own Italian food  from now on.",

    "text": "Heaven on earth!!   This explains our experience extremely well. We went in about 11pm. It was busy to our surprise, but it did not impact the service at all.   Our server was beyond amazing. He was courteous, and atttentive. He barely could turn around before someone he waited on needed some thing. Most of the time when I have a waiter like that, the service suffers, but not here!  The food was orgasmic! We had the lasagna and a house salad. I have never had better lasagna! No alcoholic drinks, but the tea and Dr. Pepper were great! The chocolate cake was divine. My mouth is watering just remembering it.   The only down side was the price. It was to celebrate my first paycheck, so ewe expected a little bit expensive. With top it was about $90 for 2. Was it worth it? Hell yes! Just not an everyday place. Will definitely be back!",

Very welcoming atmosphere with friendly locals. Music from Sinatra and Dean Martin in the background and nightly live entertainment. You never know who's going to show up to sit in with the piano or just for a late dinner. Solid, Fresh homemade menu of Italian Classics. It's hard to go wrong here - Lasagna, Fettuccine or Seafood Diavolo are my favorites. In a 24 hour town it's nice to have a place away from the strip that's comfortable and always open. It's never to early or late to stop in. Lots of parking and easy to find.",

    "text": "I've had take-out from Bootlegger before, but I decided to finally try dining in.  We came by around 630p on a Sunday and were seated right away.  The atmosphere is old-school, with read semi-circle banquettes lining the wall.  There was a pianist playing (who was later joined by a singer - they were great).  There is a large center bar in the dining room, with video poker if you're so inclined.  As a note, there is poker but no smoking - a literal and figurative breath of fresh air!  Our beverage orders were taken quickly enough, and we had time to peruse the lengthy menu.  There are options for everyone, including healthy choices and gluten-free selections.  There's a prix fixe menu as well, just in case you brought your eating game.  Most of our drinks came, but not all.  Our server was standing at the table when the drinks were brought over and he sort of scolded the busser for not having the full order.  As if that wasn't awkward enough, he then proceeded to tell us that the busser has been working at Bootlegger for 20 years and is still only so-so at his job.  It was a very awkward interaction to say the least.  But enough about that and on to the food.  We ordered the escargot appetizer - snails in a garlic butter sauce, stuffed into a white mushroom cap.  The mushroom and the sauce were delicious.  The snail was slightly chewy.  Overall it was better than average.  I also ordered a caesar salad.  Not only was this not worth the $9 menu price, but it was definitely not good.  I believe it was made with a mix of iceberg and romaine, which is not only atypical, but also kind of crappy if the price is so high.  There was also something just off about the salad.  I wasn't able to put my finger on it (and neither was one of my dining companions who also had the salad).  It tasted like there was either oregano or dish soap in it.  Sadly, I'm not sure which.  Our entrees were next.  I ordered the pappardelle bolognese.  It's a heaping mound of pasta - easily enough for two if you've had an appetizer and a salad.  The taste was declicious with a very rich flavor.  The pasta was great too.  My dining companions also had great tasting meals (the chicken parm and the chicken insalada).  All told, our entrees were extremely large and filling, reasonably priced, and great tasting.  We rounded out the mean with a coffee and an espresso.  Our server brought the espresso out and the coffee was missing.  When the server came by with the check he asked \"did the busser not bring the coffee?\"  I guess he had to round out the awkardness for the evening.  I would defintiely go to Bootlegger for take-out again.  The food is great.  The entrees are large enough that you can probably have half for dinner and the leftovers for lunch the next day.  The value is exceptional (we had cocktails, the appetizers, entrees for three, and two coffees for under $150).  The service when you are dining-in is a little strange - or perhaps that was just our experience.",

Celebs and assorted 'Rat Pack' photos, upholstered in pleather, and yes...burgundy cloth napkins. You are seeing it right? It is good!  We ordered Calamari Frito to start. Tender and delicious! And it came out really quickly. For Dinner my Husbear had ravioli (he ordered cheese, but was served meat...no biggie but not perfect) I had carbonara which was really good. Served with a fatter than normal spaghetti noodle! Would have love larger pieces of pancetta, but it was more of a bacon crumble. Clearly the chef's spin on the dish.  Service was attentive, no complaints there.  Loved the live music! I would go back just to hear the old \"rat pack\" style music being sung live.  They do dinner specials from 3PM-5PM - too early for us. But maybe just perfect for you.  Over all - A great evening!",

I highly recommend the lasagna and baked penne. So good!!! This time I ordered the lunch lighter fare baked penne which came with a salad and the garlic knots. I still did not finish all my food.

He suggested Bootlegger as one of the places I must go and check out.   I went here the second night I was in Las Vegas for dinner . The place is dark and quiet. I would think it would be perfect to take a date here and sit real cozy and close and not be bothered. Upon arrival, the three of us were seated right away. We ordered some bottled water (suggested in vegas), and started off with some bruschetta, which by the way was really good. It was toasty perfect starter. The BREAD that they serve here is so good! I think I ate most of it before my meal came out.  For my entree I ordered the perciatelli alla carbonara which is described as \"smokey bacon w/ fresh peas & cracked black pepper in cream sauce\" The pasta was pretty good but really heavy so I couldnt finish it. but my friends really enjoyed their meals. I had some food envy with the friends shrimp scampi. Almost wished I ordered that. Bootlegger is a bit on the pricey side but DEFINITELY a lot cheaper than any Italian place on the strip,  and this place was pretty good. If you're in Las Vegas and you're looking for a good Italian restaurant. Try Bootlegger.",

The lasagna, chicken parm, and spaghetti are definitely worth the weight (not a typo!!). I'm not a spumoni fan, but my friend loves the stuff and is somewhat of a conneiseur. He thought this was one of the best he's ever had. The server we had grew up with the mob and the Rat Pack, and had a lot of stories to tell (except he didn't tell us where the bodies were!). There are several old Vegas style restaurants, but Bootlegger Italian Bistro gets it spot on.",

So while it's on the more expensive side (compared to like, olive garden) it's way better food and you'll get your moneys worth.",

Dinner was traditional Italian and pretty good, but what really made the difference was the attention we received from the staff and Sean Grady.  He did everything to make sure we were taken care of and had a good time.  Sean even gave us ideas of what to do after dinner-I can't even begin to tell you how helpful he was to us.",

My husband and I were looking for a good breakfast spot...We just happened to drive by there and I suggested we go in. I remembered they had really good breakfast pizza! However, after looking at the menu I decided to try the Italian Benny...normally I'm not a fan of eggs Benedict but the description was enticing....I really liked it! Not something I would want for breakfast everyday but it was a nice change. My hubby ended up ordering one of their regular breakfasts with a side of pancakes....The pancakes were awesome! He saved me a bite and we started joking we should order another side because they were so good!  Their italian bread served with breakfast is pretty delicious too! Kind of a smokey, old Italian, bar feel....it wasn't very busy that morning so they just sat just right off the bar. We had a really nice waiter.  Pretty average prices. Glad we stopped!",

The service is usually pretty good but can also be inconsistent at times. Stick to the servers you know.  fairly large dining area and they have outside seating if you are up for that.",

We were driving back to our hotel and saw it so decided to stop in for a late lunch.  The place is very old school and the food was outstanding.  I am Italian so I am pretty picky about what Italian food I eat.  I would recommend the lasagna and the meatball sandwich for lunch.  Great flavor and good size portions.  If we would have had time, we would have gone back for dinner to try the antipasta.  Will be back next year for NFR and will come back!  We sat at the bar and had no problems with the service.

The one thing that is consistent here is the terrible service.sadly it wasn't always so. When I come in I almost always sit at the bar or up in the lounge area because I'm a casual kind of person.  I've been in during all 3 shifts many times and I would have to say that graveyard is probably your best bet or atleast it used to be (haven't been in that late in awhile).The morning/lunch shift is pretty god awful when it comes to service.. The bartender who's name is Diane ( which I had to call and find out since she never even introduced herself) is easily one of the most neglectful and unprofessional bartenders I've ever come across in a town filled with plenty of terrible bartenders..she spends most of her time in the back corner of the bar playing on her iPad or laptop and if shes not checking her facebook shes busy bullshitting and complaining with the blonde waitress about work or her personal life.. God forbid she checks on the 2 customers she has at the bar who may need something.. Swing shift is pretty terrible too. The two blondes behind the bar need to be replaced as soon as possible.. Everytime I've ever been there (usually on a Friday or Saturday) whether its busy or not its always a nightmare. They have no idea what they're doing not to mention they are both extremely rude. It's too bad that this place has become this bad. My advice get some fresh faced staff to replace the miserable cancerous ones that are slowly killing your business one dissatisfied customer at a time..",

    "text": "The Bootlegger RUINED my wedding! About 2 months ago, I inquired about the copa room for a party of 100 people. Every time I called, the event manager was not in and I was told to call back later. After a month of trying to call, one of the managers gave me the email address to contact Denise the events manager. She was out of town, so I spoke with Ron. Ron said come in any time and someone will show me the room. My mother-in-law and I went there, FELL IN LOVE with the room, and spoke to 3 people who said it was a Wednesday and its slow and no reservations have been made for 12-12-12. I finally got an email back from Denise a week later, and she told me the date is open, people have inquired, but no one put down a deposit. She also sent me a contract which stated the prices on the web site. When I went to call her, she was at a wedding show, and would not be in until monday. So Danny showed me the room again, and took my $1,000 deposit. After a few more emails trying to contact her to set up a meeting so I could pay in full the rest of the package, she emailed me back saying she would only rent the room to me if I paid $150 a person which would come out to $15,000! (because of the 12-12-12 date). I called her and basically got the reason why : Another couple who inquired AFTER I put down the deposit was willing to spend $150 a person. So I was BACK BURNER because my package was just a basic package stated on the website and they could make more off of someone else. WOW.....they don't honor their deposits! And they don't care if you have family that got invitations flying in from all over the country..... or that you hired a celebrity entertainer that doesn't return deposits.   Denise did say that she would return my deposit in check form, but I paid cash so I called Danny and he pressed to give me cash back.  Unfortunately,  they lost more than my business over this. A lot of people who were coming most likely would have rented the venue for business on a monthly basis. Or that they could use my celebrity entertainer as a marketing tactic. I will warn them NEVER to book the copa room because of this terrible experience. And the grooms family who have been customers since the 80's will never eat there again.",

Tonight, a different waiter (older, with short grayish hair and glasses) who failed to introduce himself and gave off a harried and disinterested vibe.  Sure enough, the service was absolutely dreadful, just dreadful.  Never checked our table for silverware and my partner had to ask for a spoon when he brought coffee. Was in the middle of my appetizer salad when two entree plates get abruptly plopped on the table. The waiter became defensive when I commented it's proper to wait until the guest is done with the first course and I felt he was basically challenging my request.  Seriously, giving a customer a difficult time is a no-no, but not for this guy.  He is a representative for the restaurant and his was a pathetic display of ineptitude.  Shame on him.",

I had the cheese and meat ravioli with their special sauce. It's good and there's no complaint but of course I'm not like blown away. I would say that they're classic comfort Italian food. Aside from this we also had the steak & eggs with potatoes. This on the other hand was pretty amazing. The potatoes were well seasoned (herbs). Steak was pretty well marinated. A definite good breakfast. This is way better than Denny's or Ihops quality for sure.  Basically a nice place to chill in the wee morning that is off the strip.

His answer was no.  We then told him we would all leave because the music was too angry and loud.  He said that they always play that kind of music late at night.  So, all six of us left and we will not be going back late at night again.  Too bad.  We've been going to this fine place for decades.  But death metal just doesn't make for a nice late night meal.",

The service was just so so, didn't give us enough menus and then one of them was for pizza instead of breakfast. All in all I will definitely be coming back",

We were surprised when we walked in, this place is huge. The greeter was so nice and sat us down right away. I had the Spaghetti with meatballs and my boyfriend had some kind of seafood pasta. The food was great and the ambience was even better. We had a good view of the piano player and the lady singing. They really can put on a show! All in all, it was the perfect spot for an impromptu date night.",

Go for the Reserves.. we did :)  I love how our server knew the history behind the bistro and was kind enough to share some stories about how the booths by the bar sat the likes of the Rat Pack and various Strip Headliners.  If you're old school at heart, you'll love how classic Vegas the feel of the atmosphere is.  I think the piano player could have used a better catalog of tunes... but, it was decent enough background music.    As far as the food goes, I didn't get past the average appetizer and salad.  It was too much!  I can't wait to go back next Tuesday.. I'll be sure to save the appetite for the veal.  It's on my list.",

It was Valentines Day, although we really didn't realize it at the time and typically restaurants are reservations only. Lucky for us we were early and they were more that happy to seat us.    Read the family history that is printed on the menu and it was interesting. The food was good and the service top notch... The minestrone is worth going back for all n its own. We had been flying all day before we went to eat and I was extremely thirsty and my glass was filled without ever having to ask! Our server was a black gentlemen and he was pleasant, friendly and on top of everything.   We ended up going back a few days later for lunch with some friends and the food/services was just a good..  It's a little dark inside so hard to read the menus but I was recommend bootleggers!",

So my husband's mom came here for the holiday from Florida and I wanted to take her there Saturday night.  Unfortunately, this time was NOT a good experience whatsoever.  My pasta which should have been baked and come out piping hot and was barely warm.  Had to take almost the whole thing to go so I could properly heat it myself.  My mother in law ordered the cod and you could smell it the minute the waiter brought it to the table...extremely fishy and it cost $22 so needless to say she was very disappointed.  On top of all this, my water glass sat bone dry until I was finally able to ask my waiter for water.  When we told him the fish tasted fishy he acted surprised???  Really, I could smell it arriving and he delivered it.  We will try going to this restaurant again but it will be awhile.",

The little bread rolls they bring lack any flavor and were a bit hard. Served with a tasteless tomato sauce.  My fiance had the chicken fettuccine - the cream sauce tasted like butter.  I had the cheese ravioli with meat sauce - should've known the tomato base was going to be the same as the dipping sauce for the rolls. They definitely skimped on the meat too, I could barely even find it!  We spent just over $40 including tip (we didn't order any drinks) for a meal that wasn't very satisfying...",

I had a steak that was well prepared the first time I went. The garlic bread they are famous for really was a bust to me. But the third time I was there the garlic bread things were pretty good. (they are little squares of garlic bread).   The fetuccini Alfredo is pretty good, though it is actually better at the Cheesecake Factory. The CHICKEN they used on it was absolutely great at Bootlegger, however. Very juicy and flavorful.   Service was good or great in all three instances. Even on a busy Saturday night when the prom kids were out with their dates. And as a bonus I could actually taste the gin in my cocktails. Worth going and not a bad choice lunch or dinner.",

I don't believe anyone at our table was impressed with their meal.  The bread they served when we sat down was the best thing I had all night.  Service was very good, though a bit slow at the beginning.  The worst part though was the live entertainment was so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation at our table.  The group I was with are co-workers who see each other only a few times a year because we are based out of different areas, so meal time is supposed to be our social gathering to catch up or get to know new team members but that was nearly impossible except for the time the performer took a break between sets.

The harp player was amazing and a real treat.  The ambiance with the rounded booths and Italian decor added to the experience.  The food however which should have been the Star was a disappointment. We started with some amazing tender calamari, stuffed mushroom, and flavorful bruschetta had us excited to try the main course.  There was so much to choose.  I had veal piccata with the Alfredo side.  The veal was tender and well pounded but the salt was overwhelming and I could not eat morw Than a few bites.  It was not even worth taking home as leftovers.  Others in our group all commented the same while ordering different dishes. The meat sauce pasta, sea bass, lasagna, all described as too salty.  We joked about how salty dessert might be and passed.  Luckily our uber driver had water in the car!",

I did visit again a few times, but only for app's.  I think the best time to go to Bootlegger is when there is live music so so will have to remember to call for the schedule.    Late night, it's not so good.  Our server seemed to be having a bad night, but finally warmed up.  All good.  I should've had breakfast cause my friends entree looked great.  I ordered sliders and we shared the mozzarella sticks, which were good.  The sliders were ok.  It was super dark also with the black curtains pulled between the bar area and where the dining and live music are so I didn't like that feel either.  I will only be in when that area is opened also.  Totally different feel from what The Bootlegger is to me, it's like day and night.",

From start to finish communication with Suzy the events coordinator was very smooth and professional. I met with her a few days before the wedding to discuss all the last minute details. She actually worked the night of the  reception which added an extra touch of ease to the evening. The room was set up exactly as I had requested and was a comfortable fit for a little under 30 guests.  I was able to come in a few hours beforehand and add my extra touches. The food was delicious from the bread, to the salad, to the entrees-- which were HUGE, to the very cute cannolis for dessert. My guests were so full that they asked for to go boxes which I thought was great!  Not having to worry about set up or take down was a very big stress off my back.

They cook from scratch and some people would kill for that ricotta filled, meaty lasagna and various sauces and you couldn't blame them...You could go in blind folded, point at the menu, and it would be a winner in any flavor and quality contest Our server was a refugee from Soviet Socialist Republic of California and was very professional and knowledgeable of the menu.

If you eat her and go back to any Italian garden restaurant, you'll wonder how you fell so far and just make up a sign for waiting at intersections saying \"Will work for Bootleggers \"",

Person I was with ordered lasagna that came with house salad. It was swimming in oil.  Ordered chicken parm panini with fries. The food came delivered by someone else. Lasagna was good. My chicken parm was almost inedible. Didn't even taste like chicken parm. Finally flagged down someone for some ranch. Totally over it at that point. Ate almost half the sandwich and a couple fries. Left hungry and not happy. Will not be returning.",

    "text": "Hostess Theresa has no phone etiquette whatsoever.  I called to make a reservation for a party of 5 and she wasn't cordial at all.  She was very pushy and really didn't want to take my reservation.   I explained to her that I tried to make the reservation on the internet site, but it wouldn't accept any reservations.   She replied, \"Yah, we already know that!\", as if I was a horrible person to let her know the restaurant could be losing business!  What a joke!  Lastly, she made sure to tell me that there could be no splitting of checks at our table.  Another joke!  Get with the times.  In Vegas, you get tons of visitors and it can be difficult to not split the checks!   I asked her if there was a manager available.   She, of course dodged that question.  She took down my phone number and told me she'd have the manager call me.  We'll see...I promise I will call back if a manager doesn't call me.  I will keep Yelp users posted on the outcome. They will likely go out of business with that kind of service.  So many excellent restaurants in Vegas.  Never received a call from a manager, so I called.  The GM Steve took my call.  He was also as rude as his host!  He really didn't want to hear my complaint.   He told me, \"Apparently,  we can't please you, so have a good life\".  He then hung up on me.  I can only assume he trained the host, or they are a couple.  Don't eat at this place.  Save yourself the disappointment.   Losers.",

Baked penne w ricotta was swimming in overcooked sauce, hardly any ricotta.  $8 salad is ala care and the dressing was not mixed well so vinegar on top swimming in oil on bottom. Bread was overcooked on outside. Courtesy bread squares were heavy in garlic. Chocolate cake was small and crunchy from uncooked sugar.  The coffee was ok.  The whole meal came to about $80.  Definitely not worth it, not even worth half that.  Service..we had to ask for everything but the main course, even water refills.  Would not recommend.",

And I completely forgot that this place has been in my Bookmarks for idk how long lol.   Walked in and was seated immediately in a booth. Cody was our server and he was amazing. Attentive and friendly, never felt neglected during our dining experience.   Food came out quick. Complimentary garlic knots and marinara sauce were served right away. We ordered the 3 piece tomato bruschetta and escargot as appetizers. They were both pretty good. Bruschetta was nice and crispy. Can't say too much about escargot since I've only had it maybe twice in my life but I enjoyed it here. As for entrees I ordered the Pappardelle Bolognese. It was just a tad bit too salty otherwise is was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the Seafood Fra Diavalo. They did not skimp out on the seafood! I think I enjoyed his meal more haha. And of course Cody knew to cover my entree with Parmesan cheese until I couldn't see it anymore lol.   If you're looking for a late night bite or even a romantic dinner out, they have a bar area or a dining area for what ever the occasion. There was even a piano man to set the mood. It was our anniversary night and we weren't even planning to do a nice dinner since we already celebrated earlier in the week but the service and ambiance here made it a very romantic.  Probably one of the best services I've had in a while. Thanks Bootlegger for the great experience!",

Looking at the menu, prices seem a little high but if their dine-in portions are as generous as their takeout specials \"Dinners for 4\", then they're reasonably priced. I couldn't believe the amount of food we received for $28. The food was so heavy, I thought the handles would rip away from the bag before I could get it to our room. We got spaghetti with meat sauce and it came with house salad (spring mix with tomatoes, cucumbers, and garbanzo beans with some kind of vinaigrette) and \"panetti\", little squares of breadstick-type bread. We also ordered calamari. Granted we don't eat large portions of food, but after 4 adults and 3 kids had their fill for lunch, there's still about half the food leftover. Absolutely great value!",

On the other hand, they had so many rules for just going in for cocktails with a group of business partners.  We made it clear we'd spend money, but on drinks and appetizers, not full meals.  So they stuck us all in a tiny corner of the bar.  We couldn't use tables that might order full meals, nor use any bar spots that had a poker machine.  We ended up order a ton of drinks and apps, so they made their cash.  Service was good, and the appetizers were tasty.",

My husband ordered the vongole, which is one of his favorites at Italian restaurants.  The kids both got the baked rigatoni (which they could have shared!). Large portions.

We sat in the dining lounge so that we can listen/watch the performer while we dined. I'm sure if you sit at the bar to watch sports, you can still hear the performer.  FOOD We received garlic bread with marinara to dip and they were good and soft. APPETIZER: Funghi di Maria which was a mushroom stuffed with meat. It was juicy and the sauce was tasty. MAIN: We ordered the lasagna (it was cheesy) with meat sauce Chef Maria's Saltimbocca with Chicken Breast (This was a tiny bit spicy but a good dish. This one takes a little longer to cook.).  DRINKS The martinis were $14. Classico Gin Martini. Pretty sure it said comes with a garlic stuffed olive and pepperoncini, but only came with a garlic stuffed olive. Oh well. Still good. The other martini my boyfriend ordered was something with a cucumber in it. That was very refreshing. I wish I ordered that one. Wish the martinis were a few dollars cheaper, but one was good enough while waiting for our dinner.  I would like to come here again to try another dish. I enjoyed the ambience that Bootleggers provides.",

A buddy that lives in Vegas suggested this place as a long time, local, tradition filled stop that would provide a good meal and a different, old Vegas experience.  He wasn't wrong.  Kodie, our waiter was beyond awesome and walked us newbies through the entire menu, drink list, providing recommendations that were spot on.  Everything was served promptly and tasted great.  I really don't have anything negative to say other than the location is a bit out of the way (UBER was $27 Round trip from a mid strip hotel) and the food rates a solid 4.  When I asked crazy 1/2 Italian wife whether she would return or prefer to continue with some other spots we have frequented, she said that she would love to go back (high praise people!).  A bonus in all this is that once off the strip everything is priced more reasonably than anything closer to the strip/hotels.    Bonus tip--its close to the Premium LV Outlets South so make a day of shopping and have dinner at the Bootlegger before heading back to your hotel to get ripped off with $17 drinks and just okay food.  That will make this a 5 star stop for you I promise!",

I had tried to eat here back in December but the parking lot was full so we left.    The restaurant is big and has an old Italian feel to it.   They have a lunch menu which is pretty extensive.   First off, they serve this baked bread with a tomato sauce.  It's really yummy and hard not to fill up on it.   My friends and I all ordered the Lite Lunch Selections.  I had the Eggplant Parmigiana and my friends had the Spaghetti and Meatball and the Baked Meat Ravioli.  These are served with a house or Caesar Salad and a piece of garlic bread.  The salad was fresh and even had garbanzo beans in it  I really liked my Eggplant.  The sauce was really tasty and a little chunky.   My friends enjoyed their meals too.    Service was awesome.  Lolo was great!  He was friendly and attentive.  He kept our drinks filled and made sure we all were happy.  He even ended our meal with hot napkins to wipe our hands.  Such a nice touch.   I would say the only downside to this place was the kind of unfriendly lady who sat us.  She tried to sit us at 2 tables which hadn't been cleaned yet and seemed to not even care.  I don't even know if she meant to be unfriendly or if that's just the way she is.  Oh well... Lolo more than made up for her.",

    "text": "Amazing Italian food with fantastic service!! My boyfriend and I came here last night for dinner to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. We were extremely impressed with the food and service. The staff were genuinely friendly, courteous, and welcoming the second we walked through the door. This old-school Italian restaurant has a lot of family history, which I feel is always important when it comes to the authenticity of the food and the preparation that comes with it. My boyfriend made reservations and requested to have us sit at a booth near the harpist (and of course, they did). The beautiful music from the harp and the nicely dimmed ambience of the restaurant made it a romantic dining experience for us.   Our waitress, Claudia, was very nice and knowledgeable. She was informative about the history of the restaurant since it was my first time here. Because the menu was extensive and a bit overwhelming at first, she was more than happy to answer any questions we had about the food and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. We ordered the Funghi di Maria and Mozzarella Caprese to start. In addition to the appetizers, they brought out complementary garlic knots with marinara sauce. For the main course, I ordered the Pollo Francese and my boyfriend ordered the Spinach Fettucine Primavera. Everything came out delicious and was extremely flavorful. Claudia frequently checked on us and made sure our water glasses were never empty. Although we were so stuffed, it didn't stop us from ordering dessert. We ordered the tiramisu, which is made from scratch, and we loved every bite.   Overall, we had a wonderful dining experience. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for delicious and authentic Italian food with impeccable service. We will be sure to come back again.",

They even gave us a  Complementary bottle of wine for signing up to their VIP email list before coming in.    Dessert: we chose the lava cake. That was the only disappointing part of the meal.

I ordered the eggplant parmigiana and my husband the cheese ravioli.    The eggplant came smothered in cheese with little to no sauce in it.  It was thick, tasteless and hardly breaded.  The waiter was surprised to hear I didn't like it.  He offered to heat it up,  what for?  If it's cut too thick, doesn't have sauce between the layers, it won't work.  He finally offered to bring me something else.  I opted for the ravioli.    I watched my husband eat while I sat there waiting and waiting for my meal.   It finally came and my husband was done eating.  The ravioli was warm, not hot.  It was great, it wasn't good, it just was there.  A big disappointment!  I will never go back for lunch or dinner.  Overpriced for blah food!",

More so I have recommended it at least 100 times to friends and clients with confidence.  This last time I attempted to go there was a significant wait for a party of 3. They said we could take 2, 2 top, tables in the bar. So as we started to put tables together several of the employees said we were not allowed to do that. So when I checked with the host that suggested it, and the manager, they defended their statement that taking 2 tables fit a party of 3 was not what they meant. Did they really think that 3 guest would sit at 2 separate tables? Really ridiculous, and piss poor attitude on top of it.   Being a legacy restaurants comes with a responsibility. Be helpful, be respectful and be kind. But more importantly being grateful for business. They lost a long time customer with a very broad reach. I am still young, would likely eat there another 50 times, more so recommended it another 100. But the lost all of that!",

We first asked the host what the drink specials were before being seated and he had no idea and told us to ask one of the bar servers. We went and sat at the bar area at one of the high tables literally right next to the bar and when we asked the server about the specials he said we would have to sit at the bar and then bartender could tell us the specials. Disappointed you can't get the specials/happy hour even if you're in the bar area. Needless to say after our first drinks we went and sat at the bar, however the bartender was super slow to even acknowledge us sitting there much less getting our beers. I think she only got them for us because someone else paid for our drinks lol Hopefully their food is better than the bar experience!",

I ordered the chicken Alfredo and it was bland, the sauce tasted like it could've been Ragu but that's probably a knock against Ragu.  The wife ordered chicken Parmesan and it too was bland.  Prices don't match the quality of food.  Oh yeah, and the complimentary bread knots and marinara sauce were also bland...well the marinara sauce was.

And then we remembered that Anthony Bourdain did a feature of this mom and pop restaurant in his Parts Unknown: Vegas episode. We were seated quickly at a booth by the bar. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see the live singer perform, but we did get to hear his wonderful voice through the speaker system.   For food, I had their house salad (way overpriced for what it is). For the main course, I ordered their lasagna, and wow, it's delicious, cheesy, and plentiful! I could not finish it, even if I tried. No room for dessert, either, sadly.  The ambiance was quite nice, with the feeling of old Vegas during its mobster days. You almost get a feeling this was the place you'd find those guys hang out in. Our waiter was nice, but it did take a while for him to get us situated with drinks, writing down our orders, etc. Other than a slightly slower service, all was well, and I would love to come back the next time we're in Vegas.",

The ambiance may throw some off because it's definitely dark and almost Gothic, but the live music (piano player and lounge singer) make for an enjoyable evening.  My wife, daughter, and I dined here and everyone of us thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  Beware of the bread basket on the table when you sit down.  It's filled with some of the most irresistible pieces of bread I've ever eaten.  By the time your food arrives (and they provide extremely ample portions) you may be stuffed on the bread.  If there's a drawback to the Bootlegger, for me, it just it took a little too long for our food to arrive. Other than that, it's definitely a spot on my list for my next trip to Las Vegas.",

Delicious chicken sauteed with olives, artichoke hearts and mushrooms. Yummy!!  Early (3pm to 5pm) or late night dining specials..

I'm a vegetarian so we had a delicious pasta and succulent grilled veggies and the meat eaters were loving the meatballs and chicken options.   My sister held her reception at the Las Vegas room 10 years ago--- Bootleggers has become a family tradition for us. A must stop for an authentic Italian Vegas meal.  Anthony Bourdain raves about this place and the man is right; no place like it for any occasion.",

    "text": "The Bootlegger Italian Bistro came recommended by a friend and someone who was a resident of Vegas. My fiance and I are both fans of the old school Vegas days. The Bootleggar has been around since the RAT PACK days. It's history was very well represented in the decor. I loved it! Although it was was large restaurant it felt intimate. There was a very beautiful bar in the center of the main room with seating all around it. Off to the side was a piano bar with live entertainment. We sat in the main room but we could still hear the music. It was very romantic and I would suggest this spot for any occasion. The food was exceptional. I had the lasagna and my fiance had the Veal parmesan which came with a side of spaghetti. We had drinks before our dinner and they served us bread bites with marinara sauce. So yummy. For dessert we had the creme brule. It was probable the best we have tasted in a long time. I'm already craving this experience again.",

The tiny squares of garlic bread are a fun appetizer, served with a light marinara-type sauce. My husband tends to enjoy chicken parm here, though he enjoyed the spaghetti on our last visit.  I have a complaint, though it's partly my fault for not seeking clarification. When I ordered linguine and clams, the server offered the following three sauces: \"red, creamy, or red.\" I assumed she substituted a \"red\" for \"white,\" and answered her with \"white.\" What she brought back was a CREAMY linguine. Absolutely saturated with cream, guaranteeing an upset stomach because I was unprepared. I was very saddened, but didn't feel like complaining because she was otherwise nice and attentive.  But cream? I have never seen an offering of linguine and clams with cream. Usually it's a white wine/olive oil sort of sauce. Maybe that's somebody's boat, but it's not mine.",

Incompetent to Rude Hosts (I think one is the Owner) After arriving on a Monday Night at 7PM as a group of 5 without Reservations and a Huge Wedding Party we thought the place would be Too Busy, however we were told it would be 5 to 20 minutes for a Table and so we waited in the entrance area with group that Did have Reservations at 7:00 PM.  We Both were seated around 8:30 pm, no Apologies - Just Arrogance. It was a Table for four with a chair crowded onto the end in the walkway. Two of us ordered the same item and 20 minutes After ordering we were told there was only One Available.   So even though it was my wife's Birthday Dinner, she gave it up and ordered a Simple House Salad instead, while I just Ordered Soup out of frustration. The other three in the Party got the dishes they wanted and the food finally arrived at 9:30PM - two and a half Hours after we first entered the place.  Even their Garlic Rolls were not refilled after initially bringing a small bowl for five people - I guess they were hoping they could sell appetizers.  I have many times taken out of town guest there, always Arrogance and Drama and some waiting, Yet Never again. Even my out of town guest stated after we left and all we had been through they would never recommend this Restaurant to anyone and tell them to be sure to avoid it.   They have enough business and they don't care - so why should We.  If you go for the Food, it's above average, however be prepared for Arrogance and Long waits with a (Owner) Host that always makes the place Frantic.",

My brother's wedding reception was also here and they still had stellar service. They are just south of the airport on Las Vegas Blvd, maybe 10 minutes from the strip if you hit traffic.  You sit down and before the second butt-cheek hits the chair, your bread is on the table. Very soon after that your water. I've had several different entrees there and every single one of them have been great! I love their breakfasts too.... especially at 2pm. LOL Their service is exceptional. Their food is always wonderful and I've managed to hook my family on this place too.  I was particularly impressed when they hosted my brother's wedding reception. Even though there was a selection of pre-determined items to choose from, because I'm vegetarian and not a fan of alfredo (thanks to my meat eating brother, this was the only veggie meal in his selection), they had no problem offering me something else and offering it to other people as a selection as well. I loved this. The only complaint I had, as my brother's photographer, was that the lighting was so dim, the pictures were hard to take.  The only thing I haven't had here is dessert. I'm going to have to change that.",

I learned of place by staying next door at a Hilton Garden Inn for a conference. I went down to the Wynn on a Saturday night for dinner.

    "text": "My family, relatives, friends, and I have been customers of the Bootlegger since it was on Eastern Avenue years ago.  The food is good, as well as the service.  We have had many enjoyable dinners and good times at the restaurant.  However, on Valentine's night, something occurred that still doesn't sit well with me.  This all occurred over a glass of house wine.  Yes, a glass of $5 wine.  I have told many people this story, including restaurant owners, business owners, and just your average family folks.  They all agree that what occurred should never have happened, and said it was bad business and just the wrong thing for the restaurant to do.  As a result, the restaurant lost a loyal and longtime customer, as our family will not be back.  That's what happens when you don't take care of people that take care of you.  I would have written earlier, but I was still too pissed off.      In a nutshell, here's what happened.  My family ate dinner at the restaurant and the bill came to over $400, including a $58 tip for the waiter.  The food and service was excellent.  We gave the waiter an extra $40 cash tip.  After dinner and dessert, my niece showed up and ordered a glass of house wine only.  We stayed an extra 30-45 minutes after my niece arrived.  As we got up to leave, I looked for our waiter because we hadn't received a bill for the glass of wine.  I could not find our waiter, and made my way to the restroom.  When I exited the restroom, I saw that my family had already left the restaurant.  I walked outside to the parking lot, and was told by my family that our waiter had approached a family member asking for money for the glass of wine.  They told the waiter they thought it was paid for. The waiter assured them it wasn't.  My family then paid for the glass of wine.  How embarrassing that was for my family, and totally uncalled for.  We then left the restaurant.  I couldn't believe what had just happened.     Now, we surely wouldn't walk out intentionally without paying for a $5 glass of wine.  Especially since we just spent over $400 for dinner, and gave our waiter a $100 tip, over and above the customary tip amount.  Really, chase a customer down for a $5 glass of wine?  The restaurant should have bought that wine, since it only cost them about 50 cents.  That's just bad business.  If anything, our waiter could've paid it out of his own pocket, considering the way we took care of him.  Anyway, that's not the way you treat people.  Waiter, I hope you and the restaurant learn from this costly mistake.",

It wasn't that good and I'd try many other things before I got it again. Another disappointment was the veal parmagiana, dry and tasteless.

We were looking for a place to grab a quick lunch before driving through the desert, and Bootleggers was one of the last places we saw before hitting I-5.   Their lasagna was untraditional, or at least, not what I expect from a lasagna dish. The pasta was rolled around the meat, with the sauce compacted onto one side of the dish. We didn't find the meat until we had eaten all the sauce, so we were left with a pile of pasta and dry meat. It was unappetizing.   I also had a turkey sandwich, which was fine, as far as turkey sandwiches go. I did really enjoy the french fries, although I have a sneaky suspicion that they were of the frozen variety.  Anyway, I'll probably never come back to Bootlegger's; it's out of the way, and it just wasn't that good.",

    "text": "OMG! This place was suggested by a friend who lives in Vegas for my husband and I when I asked for a good restaurant not too expensive (around $50 per person). This place is wonderful! We opted for the fixed price dinner. It was $46 per person and included an appetizer, salad, entree and dessert...one for each person, so we got two different things and shared. We tried the calamari, fried meat ravioli, caesar salad, caprese salad, Chicken Saltimbocca, Veal Parm, cannoli and tiramisu. First of all, the wait staff is lovely and friendly. Glasses are filled promptly. The little garlic bread \"knots\" and marinara are to die for (and they'll bring more if you eat them all)! I've never really been that big a calamari fan. It's usually a little too greasy and rubbery. This was light, crispy and not rubbery at all. I could eat a plate of the fried meat ravioli. Salads were both fresh and delicious. Our entrees were amazing. The pasta on the side of each was obviously fresh made and cooked. Their sauces (especially marinara was about the best I've ever tasted). My husband loved his cannoli and I haven't eaten my tiramisu yet (too full, but I'm eating it tonight with leftover meal). The portion sizes are large. The atmosphere is great. Feels like an old Italian style restaurant, but it's in a new building and is kept up beautifully. The singer with piano accompaniment was so enjoyable. We absolutely loved our experience and would go back when in Vegas again. Highly recommended!",

The entertainment was outstanding, the food was good (for the most part) but the service was so disappointing, it overshadowed the entire evening. I can understand a few items getting overlooked during a dinner, but it almost felt like a practical joke how many mistakes were made. Reversing drinks, not offering refills, leaving dirty dishes and glasses when refills did finally arrive...not checking back to see if the entrees are satisfactory.. I could go on (and there was more) but my point is made. You can go to Denny's and keep your drinks filled and your table bussed. I would hope for that much at a restaurant of this level. I did relay our experience to the assistant manager and she took my phone number to pass along to the general manager. In keeping with the theme of the night, I never heard back. Even with great musical acts performing, I don't think that would be enough to draw me back.",

In the meantime she was schmoozing the large table for obvious tip reasons.  There were only 3 of us since our daughter met us for dinner and the waitress had dollar signs in her eyes rather than service signs.  Both husband and I have waited tables before and are excellent tippers, but knew what was going on so she got a whopping 5 dollar tip from us.  An hour and 20 minutes later we were finally able to leave after getting the manager so we could get our bill and by now the restaurant was full and he had the audacity to say he was going to look to see when our ticket went up (like I was lying when I said we waited 45 minutes for our food and an hour for my salmon).  Anyway, my husband rates this place a 0, but knows I like it okay so took me there.. Now we're on the same page.    Glad I'm a local so I can spread the word.  Was fun sipping on one beer and ice cubes since filling up my water glass was too much for our waitress.. It's always more frustrating when you watch the other diners she's laughing with and running around for knowing they're having a good experience for the evening.  Bummer for the 20th.  No more going out on anniversaries..  With a smaller party you just get ignored when there's more money to be had elsewhere.  Shame on them.",

I've never actually eaten inside the restaurant, but we did order food to go fairly often (although I've only actually tried two items on their menu, pizza and one salad). Bootlegger was a great last resort place since the food is pretty satisfying and inexpensive.    Their pizzas are ginormous. The whole pizza is filled with toppings.  Trust me, they are generous with toppings. I normally would eat about three slices. I could have eaten more probably, but I'd risk the buckles on my pants breaking, so I'd normally stop at 3. The salad my co-worker always ordered was also very good too, but I can't remember what it was called.  Overall, the food here is pretty good and I would definitely want to stop by the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Our server was not very attentive and very curt. He came by to take our order and again to leave the bill. The bus boys were amazing though, they kept filling our drinks, brought our food and bread. If I could have given the tip to the bus boy instead I would. The kitchen moves pretty fast, food was ready fairly quickly. The live entertainment was great for the short time they actually played. I may never come back, I'm still unsure if I'll give them another shot at my money.",

Italian restaurant that looked like a \"Putter's Bar & Grill\" version of \"Hugo's Cellar\"?... Old school, pretty dim lighting, sorta vintage grand wood table seating and bar side poker machines around their bar..   Dinner PIcks:  Comp. Bread: Square, buttery and garlicky. Dip it in their red sauce for some super flavor  \"House Specialty\" Meat Lasagna: Hefty Portion, submerged in red sauce and I had the server sprinkle a generous amount of parmesan over it. Texture of the pasta was right, meat was good and portioned correctly, the cheese and sauce was very good. Only negative was the lack of red sauce ratio with the large slab of lasagna..   Spaghetti Classic with Maria's Meatballs: Nice amount of pasta (angel hair like) cooked perfectly aldente *snap*.. A pair of decent sized meatballs that were meaty and flavorful. Also came with that tasty, tasty red sauce  This place surprised me.. Our server had a sense of humor and was very particular, prompt and attentive. Excellent! Dining area carried that mellow feel and Prices were right on. I'd come back here for their lasagna.. I'll just ask them to drown it with their red sauce!",

We walked around the restaurant to find someone sleeping on the couch. In the back of the restaurant, we located someone (perhaps the cook?) eating a bowl of cereal and he stated he'd get someone to seat us. We were sat in the large dining area only to be forced to endure very loud rap music. I informed our server about the gentleman sleeping on the couch and she just laughed about it. I ordered the Italian style Eggs Benedict, which weren't good. The egg was poached properly, but the hollandaise lacked any flavor. It also took quite a long time to refill our drinks. I will never go there for breakfast again. Very disappointing.  I should note, I've had dinner there probably a dozen times, and I never had any problems like this and the food was terrific. If suggest staying away in the morning though.",

It took 5 minutes to receive menus, finally also greeted by the bartender, Fred. The two of us ordered drinks. Then the calamari and smaller portioned bar  lasagna. 15 minutes go by and we get our calamari.. Not bad, not amazing. Garlic knots were dry. We then see a large lasagna come out, but the bartender immediately told the runner it was the wrong size. (And we heard it) He takes it back.. 30 minutes go by.. I ask if our food will be ready soon and the bartender quickly says, \"Yes, soon.\" A smaller version comes out but it's quickly whisked away by Fred as he mumbles frustration under his breath and goes to the kitchen. We see a small female manager and ask her for the check, she says yes but that we need to wait for the bartender to come back. He comes back, says not ONE WORD to us and drops the check. The lasagna was taken off. Okay, fine, but as two people that work in the industry, you keep your customers in the loop. He said nothing, no apology, no acknowledgment whatsoever. And it would maybe be understood if we were rude, but in fact we were too easy and he assumed they'll leave if I don't say anything to them. Ruined our night, spent 1hr 40minutes for nothing. What a coward and so unprofessional.",

    "text": "First, go online and read the family history of the four generations that have participated in the smooth and delicious functioning of this historic, should-be Landmark, restaurant and bar.  Almost as famous for it's major Vegas star clientele, circa 1950's, as it is for its quality True Southern Italian cooking, you'll get a whopping portion of each, the former in framed pics on the walls, the latter on your plate.     I've always found it interesting that Big Stars rarely go to those overly decked-out eateries that the rest of us go to when we want to feel like glamorous stars.  I guess they get enough of all that fussing and fakery on stage.  When it's time to fuel up, they gravitate to these relaxed, homey, clean-but-not-dolled-up ma 'n pa joints and saloons, and for some reason, usually Italian. The one caveat is that it must have character that has organically evolved over years of many and diverse cheeks having lovingly brushed those well-worn leather seats.       Last night we lost our res. at Hugo's in the Four Queens, which I've also given a 5-star rating, because I couldn't pull myself, nor could my husband drag me, away from the damn Wheel of Fortune slot.  So we had no choice but to limp, financially beaten, and emotionally bruised, into the Bootlegger at 2 a.m.   It's times like that when only deep fried food will do, and lots of it.  Everything is \"flash\" fried so it's crisp and clean tasting.  What I especially like is that there are different coatings for the fried foods so they don't all taste the same, UGH.  The eggplant is flash-fried in a breadcrumb and parm coating, while the calamari is dipped in an egg batter.  Reasonably priced and a good go-to off-the-strip hideaway for those special times when the rest of your day at the gaming tables really sucked.",

Well; since I'm pregos and I was craving Italian food and have been wanting Bootleggers we made the short drive there.  We were sat right away in the dimmed dinning room with the perfect level of music playing in the back ground.    I was so excited when they brought out their garlic knots and basil dipping sauce about 1 minute after we sat down.  We destroyed them!  And got seconds!!!  My dad perused the menu he had a smile on his face.  Not only from the menu but the great smells all around us.  I already knew what I was having, the baked Penne, always great and lots of cheese.  I love melted cheese!  Our friendly waiter took our order; my dad got Marsala and my BF got the picatta,  then he brought my dad is wine, how could you not have a nice glass of red wine with great Italian food?  If I wasn't with child, I would have had 1 or 3  myself.    The food came in a timely manner and we jumped right in!  Right after my dad's first bite he proclaimed that his Marsala was one of the best he has ever had.  Mine was amazing as always and my BF's was gone very quickly , a sign it was great as well.  Our waiter checked back with us a few time and in my dad's True fashion they struck up a conversation about, well who knows what I was engaged in my food!  All in all we left happy, full, and I with a preggo craving filled; which some of you know is most important  I Suggest anyone who loves great Italian food  with the old school feel go to bootleggers Bistro, bring the parents with you; they may like it so much they may pay! ( Thanks dad!!)",

I think the waiter could have been clearer on his answer maybe he thought we wanted a booth in the music room.  After being seated we placed orders as usual. We received some bread and marinara sauce, which was great, and shrimp cocktail. Here's the problem we had, we waited about 45 mins to receive our food without an explanation on why it was taking so long. We spoke with the manager about our experience and she took 25% off.

Our server was in training and being trained by someone who never provided her name, to keep it simple I'll call her \"The Trainer\". At the end of our meal we all asked for boxes. The Trainer brought three boxes, which was accurate, and it went downhill from there. The Trainer was standing right next to me holding the boxes, she began asking my friends about their meal, completely normal. My friends had the gnocchi and I had a Philly Cheesesteak. As the trainer was talking to my friends, she walked around the table in the opposite direction from me. She provided my friend to my right her box and proceeded to do the same for my other friend. As she stood at the opposite end of the table from me, I wondered if maybe she was just into the conversation and forgot to hand me my box. I soon found out. She sat the last box on the corner of the table, farther away from me than necessary. I waited a moment, thinking she would realize that she hadn't handed me the to go box. She never did. She watched me reached across the table, trying my best not to let my shirt fall into the food, to get the box. She never apologized and never acknowledged the fact that she didn't sit the box near me. Being black, I am aware that racism still exists. I was aware when I walked into the restaurant that I may have a negative experience. Despite my best efforts to remain positive, I was still proven wrong. I am not condemning the entire restaurant. This was one individual who unfortunately is representing this restaurant. This was my first experience at The Bootlegger and unfortunately it is my last.",

I did not have $20 in since I used  a ticket from yesterday.  I guess they penalize repeat busisness. I was planning to visit periodically, but not now.",

I wish I would have known of this place sooner, but glad I got to dine here last week for the first time. I ordered the spaghetti with a meat ball lunch portion which also includes a salad and I must say that the portions were more than enough and great priced!   They start you off with their mama's house bread and red sauce (I forgot what it's called but it's featured in my picture) and honestly, you don't really need an appetizer. Although, next time I would like to try their zucchini.   I highly recommend eating at this place. It's open 24/7 and it's off the strip but not too far from it. You will not regret it!",

These were served with their signature marinara and was yummy. I chose the eggplant Parmesan lunch special ($14) which was accompanied by a salad. I chose Caesar. My meal also came with an order of complimentary garlic knot/bread of some sort. There was a ton of food and I could've easily shared it. The restaurant was pretty empty around lunch time and a bit dark. The bartender served me and was very attentive. Service was quick. They have an outdoor patio as well. Overall it was a great meal and I would recommend.",

I had been wanting to try this place for quite some time now and I'm so glad I decided to stop in for dinner earlier this week. We were seated promptly in their large dining area which I must say filled up very quickly as the other hunger dinner goers started to pile in. Our server brought us complimentary bread with a side of their savory marinara sauce. It was a struggle, but I had to stop myself from eating every last piece. As for my entree, I ordered my favorite Italian dish- chicken parmigiana and let me just say, their chicken parmigiana is the BEST in town! My entree was so massive, I had left overs for three whole days! I will say their food is a bit pricier than your average Italian restaurant, but you certainly get your money's worth. I'd highly recommend this place to any local or tourist looking for a great Italian meal.",

The pricing may seem a bit high but it's better than most places I've been in town.  They do offer a players card and some free play for any video poker/keno/21 fans out there, but there are better club cards and free play offers elsewhere.  The service was never an issue here, some of the best I've had from both the bartenders and servers!  The servers are usually pretty quick, funny, and considerate.  I even talked to the managers or owner once or twice and they're a great bunch.   I've had almost every dish in the join along with the drinks.  I'm certain recipes and prices can still be altered if it came up.  If you're vegan or vegetarian there are a number of dishes, but keep in mind that it's an Italian bar and restaurant so it's not prime if you're health conscious.  If you're nearby the south outlet shopping center, wanting to get away from the strip, or wanting some Italian food with some music, stop on by.  This place is worth checking out a few times during different hours.",

Bootlegger is open 24/7 and does a cool music (late night element) that has hosted lots of the old time cool musicians.    We did an early dinner as friends had to make a flight and did \"early bird\" meals.  They have a few dishes that come with a salad and are a little smaller portion which is fine by me.  The restaurant makes much of their offerings daily and on site so ask your server.  Their salads are fresh and crispy and the bread bites with marinara are delicious!  We did an order of meat ravioli, eggplant Parmesan and chicken Parmesan. And everything was good. It is old Italian comfort food.  If your looking for an upscale Italian meal....this is not it.

    "text": "Bootlegger is located south of the Las Vegas strip by the outlet mall.  It has ample well lit parking, and clean well stocked bathrooms.    Bootlegger is an old favorite of mine that I've not visited in a few years.  It was a weekly staple for years, however it's been over 2 years since I've been here and the quality of food and wait staff doesn't disappoint.    I had the chicken Parmesan, which as Peyton Manning says, \"Chicken Parm you taste so good.\"  The food was delicious, and the bread they give you at the table is also a favorite of mine.  Dunk them in the red sauce and they are to die for garlic bread knots.    The waiter we had was on point and attentive, and the piano player is entertaining and a great player.    Overall, I really like bootlegger, ownership has kept this Las Vegas gem sparkling.  Keep up the good work, I will be a customer for life, and have been for over 15 years",

I had ordered the salmon with the salmon ravioli (and asked for extra capers which they did not disappoint!). The fish was SO fresh and tasty. It just fell apart while eating it. The ravioli was to die for. My boyfriend had the chicken piccata with linguini and it was also amazing.  The service was great. Our waiter was really nice and the food/drinks came pretty fast for how delicious everything was. They also give garlic knots before your meal and we could have easily gotten full off of those because they were pretty great.  Overall, this place is a liiiiittle on the pricier side but it's absolutely worth it. Great atmosphere for a date night. I'll be back!",

I go in and find a spot at the Bar and I look over the menu, I order fried Calamari and Lasagna as it is kindsa late I am thinking the kitchen will be faster than the usual busy times that can sometime.  So I order a beer and wait, I get my Calamari and Lasagna at the same time I was thinking they would have timed them to come out at staggered times.  OK usually they serve an awesome bread with this so you can soak up the tomato sauce but I was not offered this tonight, a bit disappointing.  I start on the calamari and you can straight off tell the oil was not clean nor was it hot enough as the oil-soaked into the rings, now I am not happy, but I am willing to overlook this as maybe they have a new chef?  I get to the Lasagna and Not offered any parmesan  and I can tell it was the last of the dish as they had to cut more from another dish or it was leftover, I take a nice bite and I can tell this was Frozen, Maybe frozen several times as it was still frozen in the middle which tells me they were hurrying when cooking and did not finish heating it up, I explained to the Bartender that it was still frozen and he looked at it and tossed it out, never offered to replace it, I also told him that the Calamari is not yet done and he grabbed that also and threw it away, No explanation or anything really? OK, then I paid my bill and left.  This has always been my go-to Italian Resturant, Maybe it is time to look elsewhere.",

    "text": "There are so many amazing Italian restaurants in Vegas!  Sadly, in my opinion, Bootlegger isn't one of them.  (Although, my husband disagrees, so I'm bumping my review up one star from what I would otherwise have given).  The pre-meal bread tasted like the dough came out of a can.  It didn't taste fresh, and the accompanying sauce was just ok.  It tasted like a sauce I would've made on my own, and while I'd love to think I'm an amazing cook, my sauces just don't have the same depth of flavor that I expect from a good Italian restaurant.  I ordered the baked penne, as many reviewers had mentioned enjoying the dish.  It was plain and not very cheesy, and it had definitely just been heated for a few seconds under the salamander.  So the cheese was melted, but not how it should be for a \"baked\" dish (bubbly and slightly browned).  My husband had the spaghetti classico, which he REALLY enjoyed.  It had the same sauce base as the sauce that came with the bread.  However, the ambiance of the restaurant is top notch!  We loved the oldschool Italian vibe.  Service was friendly and the entertainment was good (singer/piano player).  The lobby area was beautiful, and the women's bathroom had a classic glamorous feel to it.  I wish I could've written a 5-star review, because I was really hoping for fantastic food.",

The host/manager happily took our luggage and sat us promptly(I had a reservation). Our waitress Claudia was the friendliest and most welcoming in this classic and romantic Italian restaurant.  $28 Chicken Saltimbocca: it was so delicious when I had it last year that I ordered it again. It seemed even bigger and better this time. A magnificent meaty mix of chicken and Italian meats covered in an aromatic and herbal mushroom sauce. Served with a generous portion of their alfredo linguine.  $22 Lasagna...not the traditional frozen lasagna you'll get at Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill. Its full of seasoned beef wrapped in an outer layer of thick lasagna noodles and covered in cheese. Rich, hearty, and tasty.   $9 Italian Cream Cake...a fluffy cake filled with marscapon cheese with a hint of lemon.  Unique and delicious, and I don't think it exists anywhere else in America.   House wine bottle: we got it for free, but its normally $25.  No complaints!    Hope to eat here again next time I'm in Vegas!",

First, I'm the odd ball out the group that loves my steak WELL DONE (don't attack) just yet lol but I cannot eat anything that is pink or especially anything with blood oozing out  so ordering steak makes me so nervous because it always has pink. The chef is probably back there like \"I will not let her ruin this steak\" haha   Surprised, my steak  was well done (no pink) and still super tender without having to chew it as though it were leather for 15 minutes and for that, I thank you.   The shrimp was amazing! It was very flavorful and was cooked just right. It wasn't rubber shall I say.   The broccoli was nicely seasoned yet still had that crunch which I really enjoyed.   Lastly, the fettuccine was nice and creamy. Cooked perfectly.   This was very good and I had a meeting, so I had to take it to go and it still was delicious! $32.95 may seem like a lot but it literally was the best steak I've had in a long time",

    "text": "I've been here half a dozen times over the years and The Bootlegger never disappoints.  Today I met a friend for lunch, someone visiting Vegas from out-of-town.  Not crowded, so we were able to sit and chat even after we finished dining.  I had a bottle of water which I had carried to the table from the bar; the bus person kept my friend in iced tea even after we paid.  I had Linguine with Clams, clear broth.  It was VERY liquidy, but I guess that's what broth is.  Not as much flavor in the broth or on the pasta as I would have expected.  Cheese probably would have made a difference, but I am now avoiding dairy (which isn't the Bootlegger's fault).  The bread knots were okay, not great.  Maybe they should be \"garlic cheese bread.\"  The sauce was very good.  I took two orders of Lasagna home with me, as a treat for my husband because he thinks the Bootlegger has the best Lasagna in Las Vegas.  I just now had a few bites, cold, and it was awesome!  Cool environment, very \"old Vegas.\"  It'll be nice if/when they upgrade the video poker machines to be bigger and more clear; and to include Triple Play.  I always book using Open Table and have never had an oops with the reservation.  Staff members are good.  The waitress, however, was done with us once we paid.  She wouldn't look our way. I tried a couple of times to flag her down to take our photo.  Finally had the busser do it -- and then I gave him a $5 tip.    Am returning at the end of the month, a party of four, for my husband's birthday because he loves the Lasagna.  Easy to get to; big parking lot; when there is entertainment, it's very pleasant.",

The food that we had this time was a little different from the usual pasta and meat dishes. We did their salads. Salmon salad and Cobb salad's. The preparation was delicious and very inviting. The service was the only downfall of the entire experience. It was slow the waitress that was helping us did not follow the normal polite protocol of asking the ladies what they wanted first. Call me old fashion, but it was even a Mother's Day weekend.    Beyond all that the prices are great and the wine prices are really competitive. I will return, it's not like ones performance will stop me from coming back to a place where the chiefs continue to put out consistently good food. And if that person continues to services people that way, they most likely won't be around that long.",

Absolutely one of the best tips ever as this Italian restaurant is a must go to restaurant.   I went for lunch. Immediately I was impressed with a quiet and very comfortable atmosphere. The restaurant decor was spot on for a Italian restaurant. I felt like the Godfather sitting down with my boys in a room made to make you feel like you were in Italy.   My waitress was great and service was quick. She did not hesitate to have drinks, appetizers, and fresh bread at our table.   I ordered the Meatball sandwich. Make sure and come with a big appetite because this sandwich is HUGE! Made with their specialty in house made meatballs (3 per sandwich) on a fresh French roll covered in marinara and mozzarella, served with extra sauce on the side. If you love meatball sandwiches this is for you.   My wife ordered the Chicken parmigiana panini. A breaded chicken breast covered in buffalo mozzarella, and marinara sauce, topped with fresh roasted red peppers and basil. All placed on a fresh toasted roll.   All lunch items come with choice of fries, pasta salad, potato salad, or chef salad. Before your lunch is served you get as much fresh bread served in squares with a side of marinara sauce. I did not order any alcohol so no comment on that. But the fresh brewed iced tea is really good. Next time I visit The Bootlegger I'm going for the Lasagna for sure. Either way if you're looking for something different than the average chain Italian restaurant you have to try The Bootlegger.",

I always ask what is your best dish. The waiter said he thinks their Lasagna is. So that's what The wife ordered. She would rate it one of the best lasagnas she's ever had. Hands-down.  My kid got the spaghetti and said it was really really good.  I got the salmon and thought it was spectacular. Totally worth every penny, we will certainly be back.

That's the best kind of restaurant. The staff was so kind, shared a little history of the restaurant, and helped us celebrate our friends birthday. We started with the escargot and the butter mixture is was drenched in was incredibly tasty. We were dipping our bread in it the rest of the night.

Answer: The Bootlegger  The party started with the Antipasto Classico, Braised Pork Neck Bones and Mussels fra Diavolo. The cold antipasto was traditional for both Andrea and I being 100 percent first generation Italians, classic cold cuts (prosciutto, mortadella, capicollo), provolone, olives, roasted red peppers; the dried dates and figs were new but delicious none the less. Mussels were a bit sandy and chewy but for a city that is nowhere near water not bad and braised pork neck bones literally came off said calcium deposits used for structural framing.  Main course for me was the Seafood fra Diavolo, clams, calamari, prawns, mussels over linguine in a white sauce. One of my favorite dishes in most restaurants and here was no different.  Dessert was complimentary cannoli's  for us which was just amazing and very nice of the staff.  Ambiance paid tribute to it's Italian American theme, carpeted floor, upholstered wooden dining chairs, dim lighting and a pianist/singer duo; baby we were definitely in Vegas. Ciao, ciao.",

We drank--Mondavi merlot.    The food and service were excellent and well priced.  The pasta was fresh and the sauces well seasoned.  The eggplant parm was light and crisp, not greasy.  The alfredo sauce had just a hint of nutmeg like I like it.  The ricotta in the manicotti was creamy and light.  Our server checked on us regularly (we were there for almost four hours watching the performances).    We were not fans of the wine--it was flat and flavorless.    The entertainment was fantastic.  Open Mic in Vegas means seeing stars have fun for free.  Highly recommend a Monday night visit.",

In Vegas I usually stay downtown, I eat at old school steakhouses, and I love the original Oceans 11.  So when my brother that used to live in Vegas recommended this place and told me that it has been around since the Rat Pack days I knew we had to go there.  When we came in were were seated immediately by the friendly staff and our waiter was Johnny on the spot with our drink order.   We sat in the bar area and in the main dining room was a live singer and a piano player doing old school standards.  The ambiance was perfect.   My pre-dinner extra dry vodka martini was perfectly prepared and my fiance's \"Italian\" margarita (a house specialty) was delicious.  The bread bites with marinara sauce were a great into to our meal.   My veal Parmesan was exceptional and the lasagna my fiance had was probably some of the best I have tasted.  We had the Creme Brulee for dessert even though it's not really a Italian dish but it is my favorite and it was fantastic.  Sadly I don't remember the bottle of wine we had but it was the perfect match to our meals.   The only negative I can think of is now that we have discovered this place I will have a hard choice between here and my other favorite Italian place in town.",

We arrived early for our reservation, and the host and bar waiter were somewhat discourteous, which made us feel not necessarily welcomed.  The host partially made up for his dicourteousness by seating us in a booth near the live entertainment.    Once seated, our waiter, who was a sommelier, was five star! He made great food recommendations and paired a perfect wine for us. The live entertainment, Frank Bugati, was a Sinatra style vocalist/keyboardist who was great and what you would expect a Vegas lounge act to be.  The food was four star and traditional Italian.",

We arrived around 9pm on a Tuesday night and decided to sit at the bar. The bartender was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. We ordered wine and he kept our glasses full the entire time. I had the Ensalata Lorraine with Chicken which was quite good. My friend ordered Shrimp Cocktail, Caprese Salad, and Fried Eggplant appetizers and she ate every bite! She said they were very good as well. The garlic bread was a bit greasy but still good. My favorite part of the meal was the Chocolate Lava Cake which was so rich and moist I would absolutely come back just for this. I also tried my friend's Tiramisu which is made in-house and was extremely light and fluffy, the complete opposite of my dessert. We stayed until just after midnight and really enjoyed our experience. Great menu and great service, we will definitely be back.",

Bootlegger did an EXCELLENT job of accommodating our party. From the moment we walked in the service was excellent, professional, and friendly. From the charming hostess to our very friendly and efficient head waiter, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. The food was great - large portions and very good. If you're looking for a Michelin type food experience (we weren't) this is not the place for you. There's live entertainment (piano/singer) that could easily be cheesy but was anything but. The singer  had a great voice, was talented, and knew his craft - a True professional. The Bootlegger is like what Las Vegas used to be - the good parts. Overall, an amazing experience that we would be happy to repeat the next time we visit.   If you're looking for an authentic Vegas dining experience off the Strip you cannot go wrong with the Bootlegger Italian Bistro. Great job!",

    "text": "You know how they say first impressions are everything, in many cases they truly are. I planned a Wednesday girl's night out (6 of us) for mani/pedis and drinks afterwards at Bootleggers because of it's proximity to Vanity Nails & Spa (which was wonderful and great prices). I called ahead on Tuesday to first verify that they had a separate lounge area from the dinning area so I would know if reservations would be necessary. When I spoke to the waitress on the phone she let me know that they were indeed separate spaces so I did not make reservations.   On Wednesday the Girl's night of mani/pedis went as planned, wonderfully, then off to Bootleggers around 6:30pm on a Wednesday. We had to stop and ask someone how to find the entrance first, they had outdoor seating but there were no doors open on the north side. We stopped what was apparently a phenomenal piano guy that provided us direction to the street facing entrance (mind you we hadn't even started drinking yet).   We walk into the entrance and saw a dinning sign that stated to wait to be seated so we moved past to the bar lounge area where a sign said seat yourself. The bar was full so we started looking for an open lounge table next to the bar. Many of the tables were reserved so we found the first one that wasn't and sat.   We sat there for less than 5 minutes and a waiter walk up to us and asked how many were in our party, we replied 6 total. He then followed up that the \"lounge\" table we were seated at was reserved and we would need to wait 40 minutes to be properly seated. Mind you there was no room at the bar so already Girl's night was coming to an awkward silence. What were we to do, awkwardly wait in the hallway for all the 50 something's to finish dinner so we could be \"properly\" seated or head out and find a new spot. Needless to say we left for Buffalo Wild Wings where there was plenty of bar seating and Girl's night could resume.   I'm not writing to say that Bootlegger's isn't good, from all the recommendations on this site it would appear the garlic bread and marinara are fabulous but through some haphazard, awkward and confusing encounters or lack there of I won't be back and nor will the other 5 girls. I don't know if it's a \"woman\" thing or a \"personality\" thing but when go into a restaurant/bar lounge with no greeting or direction and I try to figure out what to do based on signs and logic and it doesn't work out in my favor I tend to not ever want to revisit that location.",

    "text": "Great place. Friendly staff, wonderful decor. Very accommodating to our needs. We went with a large group, including a child in a high chair and it was very nice.   This is the best meal I had in Vegas.  A big complaint I have with Vegas is everything is fake, nothing is real, but this place is the real thing.   We were seated and upon ordering given generous portions of their fresh made bread and dipping sauce. Very tasty and held us while we waited for our meals.   Everyone's food was prepared perfectly and tasted great. The child portion was still very huge and featured one huge delicious meatball. My clams over linguine in white sauce was perfect.  Deserts were very delicious. Meals should cost about $30 per person with drinks and such, and you'll probably take some home with you. The portions were very generous.    each meal looked and tasted like it was made just for us.   You MUST come here when you come to vegas. You have to.   They also have live entertainment most every night from 5:30-9:30. This night featured a very friendly pianist/vocalist who entertained us and took requests. He was very accomodating and a added a fun touch.",

    "text": "I visited the restaurant last night with my family and was pretty disappointed. Note.... Nothing comes with soup or salad on the menu! That's an extra cost and pricey. I started off with a Caesar salad.... Not impressed! For my main course I had the penne pasta it was ok but again not for the price. What really bothered me was the service we had. Service is everything!!! I'm amazed that this restaurant has been in business for sooo many years has the service it has. Honestly the service was horrible!!! Our server was plain out rude! He never came around to ask if we needed anything. When our food came out he didn't ask how we were enjoying it. I asked for a sprite he forgot so I had to ask the busser. We all pretty much left all of our food so when he took my aunt's away she asked him to wrap it up for her. Instead he threw it away... Really!? Luckily he didn't throw the rest of ours away. When he brought the check be didn't say thank you.. Thanks for visiting us.... Hope you all enjoyed our food... Nada!!!! He waited at the bar watching us until we paid ( I absolutely hate when servers do that). Honestly we won't be back again there wasn't much we enjoyed other then our conversation.",

We started with cocktails and the bruschetta appetizer, the drinks were tasty and the bruschetta was very light. For dinner, hubby had shrimp scampi with linguini, which was great, the shrimp were big, perfectly cooked and plentiful the pasta was perfect al dente. I had Angel Hair Pomodoro, which was light and fresh and a HUGE portion. There was live entertainment with a wonderful singer who sang the classics. Our server started out great, but turned out to be not-so-great, kinda full of himself and not very attentive. But that didn't spoil our meal, we would definitely go back to Bootlegger, it's a great off-strip option and an excellent, excellent value.",

We have been coming here for 10 years and have never been so offended at their absolute indifference to any semblance of customer service.  Usually a nice family-operated restaurant with family friendly atmosphere.  Not even close today.    Called ahead on a Sat night at 5:40pm to check the wait for 4 + baby.  Was told no wait and arrived within 10 minutes.  Was offered the \"lovely\" table right next to the kitchen...  Totally unsuitable for 3 adults and an active 4 year old, so asked for a different table.  Was told by the blonde hostess (who was the one who answered the phone when I called) that all the other empty tables were reserved for reservations, and we needed to wait 30 mins for a different table.  I guess when I called \"no wait\" was only for that 1 table and she failed to mention it...  Seriously?  She and the bearded host offered no alternatives and wanted to do nothing for us, and they seemed indifferent to losing our business when we walked out.  I guess they are doing so well that they can turn money away.  Lucky them.  They were so rude, I wanted to give them zero stars, but, alas, you can't do that on Yelp.  Such a shame that they don't think that customer article (or general good manners) are an important part of the restaurant dining experience because the food is better than your average American Italian fare, but, as everyone knows, American Italian places are a dime a dozen, so it shouldn't be too hard to find a new spot.  Open to any suggestions, since we are clearly looking for a new place...",

    "text": "Meh.   I won't be coming back anytime soon, unless friends want to come, and then I would join. I think this place has potential...I just did not have a good experience.   This actually was not my first time here...the first time was a few months ago...we came in and stood at the front entrance for about 10 minutes, and no one ever came around. We flagged a waitress down and she did tell us that they were super busy and understaffed...so even if we chose to stay, which we did not, it would have been a long wait for food too.   So I have been looking forward to coming back here since I have heard good things,  and obviously we came on a bad night the first time.  Well, not sure this was much better. The staff was very friendly when we sat down. I ordered the eggplant appetizer, which was good.  Then I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo with no meat on top.   The Fettuccini was very thick and had formed a film on the top from obviously sitting too long. I tasted it, and it was luke warm. I immediately lost my appetite for it.  Another person at my table had the same problem with her Alfredo.  She mentioned it to the waiter, and he offered to give me a fresh plate of pasta.  Well, ok.  I'd love a hot fresh plate of pasta. While I'm waiting, the waiter made a point to come tell me that the cook stuck a thermometer in it and it was 140degrees. Ok?! And!?  I told him the bottom of the plate was warm, so maybe it touched the bottom. So a few minutes later, I get my same plate of pasta, boiling hot!  That would be great, except it was obvious he put it in the microwave, because now the fat had separated from the cream, and the plate of pasta was all oily. Wow.   Anyway, the manager did come over and apologize and take it off my bill. The eggplant was decent, and the other waiter Alfredo was super friendly. So, I think this place has potential...so I will give it 3 stars for now.",

I've been here for both lunch and dinner and when I come here for lunch with my co-workers service is very quick which we all appreciate since we only get 1 hour. Bread with marinara sauce is put out on the table when you are first seated and it is sooooo good!! The pasta dishes are all good. My fave is probably the meat ravioli. Caesar salads are cold, crisp, and have the right amount of dressing. I seriously can't think of anything negative about this place. I also love the old fashioned feel of this restaurant! Come during the evening and they have performers singing and playing piano in the main dining room; I can't recall if this is every night though. If you haven't eaten in this establishment you are missing out on a great dining experience!",

You get bread and marinara sauce which was delicious before meals. Meals range from $16 up to 50 a piece. I had the seared salmon and my husband had shrimp scampi they were both well made cooked to order and very yummy. We also had a lemon drop martini and a sangria which were very strong at 13 and $14 a piece I would hope they would be... Ambience was okay definitely a casual place for dress code I felt very overdressed.... We would go back again.",

Had the calamari as an appetizer , along with the little breads with the dipping sauce. Both fantastic. Don't eat anything  the WHOLE day before you come here, so you can carb out.  My date and I decided to share a large plate : The Seafood Diavolo. The best!! With a side of Italian zucchini.  Our waiter was delightful. Usually most waiters annoy me, sometimes they try to hard, this guy was just naturally cool. The busser was the cutest little mexican man. I wish I could remember both their names!

Jenny D. and I were on a double-date and didn't realize it was Monday night Cabaret open mic, which was a nice little treat.    The last few times I've eaten at Bootlegger's, I was NOT impressed with the pastas.  The only thing I had ever liked there were the pizzas, but Jenny had gone in a week before and was ranting and raving about the Diavolo so I decided to give it another chance.  I ordered the Osso Bucco and my date ordered the Lasagna.  OMG my Osso Bucco was SO GOOD.  Instead of one giant shank, it was 5 small ones.  The meat was fall-off-the bone tender and so full of a robust flavor.  It came on top of risotto and asparagus.  I completely cleaned my plate.  Unfortunately I was too full to try my date's lasagna but he said it was the top 2 best lasagnas he has ever had.    In addition, we ordered the Caprese salad, bruschetta, canoli, and tiramisu.   The only thing I wasn't very impressed with was the canoli.  It tasted a bit like artificial sweetener.    Everything from the food to the service was great.  We lucked out because a reservation for a booth got canceled and the hostess (maitre d'?) sat us there.  It was a primo spot with a clear view of the cabaret.  We had an amazing time.",

Because it was so late, we were set in a dining area right next to the bar which was fairly busy and so a bit noisy (main reason for 4 stars instead of 5).  That being said in the main dining room they had a pianist/singer who was very reminiscent of the Rat Pack in their heyday.  We were a party of three and ordered two of the chicken parmesan with their house made Bolognese and angelhair pasta.  I ordered the pappardelle with the rose sauce (bolognese with cream) which was insanely delicious and rich.  The portions were large and we all took left overs.  The scrumptious bread likely didn't help.  I also ordered a blood orange Cosmo which was tasty and strong.  We were too full to order dessert but the double espresso and cappuccino were nice.  The bill was $100+ and worth every penny.  We will make sure we return when we visit Vegas again.",

Seems that a lot of their kitchen staff had recently walked out do to a request for higher pay after being on one of the TV shows. The meals we ordered were fantastic so they must still have some of the good staff.   It was a bit pricey for my tastes and we were scoping them out as a possible after weeding meal place.  We may go back for that meal as they did give us a buy one get one coupon.    If you don't mind paying a bit more, I would truly recommend their food and ambiance.  Hopefully they will have worked out the kitchen staffs attitude and patron's won't be required to wait so long.",

Now the fact that it's open 24 hours shouldn't throw you off. The food is genuinely good and the service it's great. My waiter was highly attentive, friendly, and talkative about the restaurant's history and the celebrities that have been/do go there.  I had Maria's Saltimbocca with chicken, and my mom had the tagliatelle bolognese. Both dishes were great! They were both on the richer, heavier side, so if you go, go hungry. We also both had the minestrone soup, which was delicious and hearty, and the bread bites they bring with marinara was a great touch.  If you want old Vegas feel with quality food, go to this place ASAP. Anthony Bourdain visited on his show \"Parts Unknown,\" and if he liked it, you probably will too ;)",

We walk in and the men up front we're talking amongst themselves, not once looking at us or acknowledging us. We stood there staring at each other and looking for signs to see if we came in the right way. We even said \"is this the entrance?\" to each other. We decided to walk past the hosts and finally one of them decided to ask if they could help us.   We get our table and we're served these pieces of toast and marinara sauce which was meh. Our waiter was busy socializing with the other waiters so it took a while to order.   We finally order our food which we're pretty excited for because we seen the pics on Yelp and it looked delicious. I order the chicken parm which was $24 so I'm expecting a decent meal for that price. What showed up was a dried chicken patty covered in cheese and a scoop of spaghetti with the same sauce they serve with the toast. When I say the chicken was dry, I mean it was dryyyyyy.   Save your money and go to Olive Garden, the chicken parm is better there!",

    "text": "This was probably the worst service I have ever received. I'm so upset because we haven't been here in years and my mom was looking forward to celebrating her birthday. It was my mother, her bf, my brother and I. They had ordered chicken dishes and my brother and I ordered a pizza to share. (They have amazing pizza) The entrees came out, 20 minutes later (after we are starving) our pizza comes out. I ordered the pizza that had pepperoni, cheese, and mushrooms because we are simple. It came out with all kinds of stuff on it. Peppers, onions, olives. I immediately told the server that we didn't order that, he looked absolutely offended and said yes you did. I said no we did not. He asked if we wanted that and I said no. He left. 10 min later he comes back with the pizza menu and begins to argue with me telling me I ordered the pizza Classico or something and I kept telling him I did not order that. I ordered the pizza with pepperoni and cheese. He continued to argue 5x with me back and forth in front of other guests that I'm wrong and he wrote down pizza Classico. He told me \"you may have thought you ordered that one but I wrote this one down\" I was absolutely shocked when he spoke to me that way. I'm completely offended at this point. I told him to go get a manager after 5 minutes of arguing basically screaming at me. The manager then came and comped our meal. Well my mothers meal because I didn't get to order the pizza. I am extremely upset because the food here is amazing and I waited 45 min for a pizza and did not even get it and had to leave. I'm appalled at the behavior this server had. I'm a server myself and the guests are always right. I have been in positions where the right dish did not come out and I simply apologize and get whatever they want because regardless if I am right they are enjoying dinner with me and I am not going to argue with a customer. Aside from this at the beginning I ordered a Mountain Dew. He said they don't carry that. I then looked in the menu where it specifically said under beverages Mountain Dew. I pointed he told me \"oh that's wrong, a lot of things are not right on the menu\"... what the hell am I suppose to think? 5 min later he brings me a Mountain Dew and apologizes and said \"I don't study the menu\"  I have no words for the disrespect I received this evening. I don't recall his name and I wish I had gotten it. I did speak to the manager who apologized but regardless there is no reason someone should speak to a person that way let alone a guest. I am 23 years old and serve myself and would never disrespect anyone that way in or outside of work. Absolutely disgusting the way he speaks to people and ruined my mothers birthday dinner.",

But the real reason why I'm giving them a 5 star rating is because of the ambiance. Once you enter this establishment, it feels/looks like you stepped back into time of the Mafia days.  Been here twice. Both times, I ordered the Chicken Parmesan. Entree is big enough for two days worth of food. I always have leftovers and it tastes just as great the next day. My date ordered the Papperdelle Bolognese and Baked Penne the second time around. But wow...the Papperdelle Bolognese was out of this world!!!!!! The taste and flavoring of the sauce was like an orgasm in my mouth! O_O Definitely one of the best pastas I've tasted in a long time.  We also got an order of Bruschetta as an appetizer. Great starter item. You can choose between tomato basil or eggplant. We got both but in the end, we preferred the tomato basil.  The prices here are much more affordable than your typical Italian restaurants on the strip. It's located in a plaza right after The Premium Outlets, South. Easy to find and it's 24 hours.",

    "text": "I was invited here for dinner with the promise of being entertained by the most talented lounge singer in Las Vegas. Of course, how do you say no to that? The Bootlegger bistro is an old-school Vegas landmark whose owner was once a powerful lady in this town. The moment I walked in the door, I looked around and noticed that I was the youngest person in the dining room - everyone else had a good 20 years on me. No big deal. I've always been fond of the elderly - with their interesting stories and life experience.   My friend Doug pointed to the gentleman playing the piano and said, \"there's Jimmy Hopper, the man with an amazing voice!\"   I nodded then proceeded to order a bellini-tini and the tomato-basil bruschetta. My friend ordered some old-person's drink involving cognac and the escargot appetizer. This is an Italian restaurant with the typical Italian faire on their menu. I eyed an item that sounded delicious, the spinach ravioli in marinara sauce; unfortunately it was under the gluten-free section. After a moment of hesitation as I don't have Celiac disease and ultimately have no reason to order a gluten-free item, I decided to get it anyway because spinach and cheese sounded just way too good. At this point, my friend asked for another cognac drink and the fish of the day (mahi mahi with risotto and asparagus).  I thought the bellini-tini was great and that made up for the mediocre bruschetta appetizer. My friend, being a gentleman, offered me some of his escargot. They tasted pretty good! I don't know how much they cost but there were 4 or 5 of them on the plate so this is a fairly small item.  When my ravioli arrived, it was pretty delicious; the filling was perfect although the pasta pockets were a bit chewy because of being gluten-free I guess. Over all though, this is a fairly healthy item while being a huge entree so you are definitely getting good value for the price paid.   I also got to try my friend's dish. Oh man, this item was so freaking good! The mahi mahi was flaky, moist, perfectly seasoned and the sauce it was in didn't overpower the fish. But you know what the best part was? The risotto underneath the fish. I could eat a whole bowl of this risotto! Yummmmmmmm!   Meanwhile, Jimmy Hopper was over there belting out scores after scores, both oldies and songs he had written himself. Indeed, this man has a great great voice. My friend encouraged me to request a song so I did! Guess what song I requested? Royal. Yes! You're probably thinking, \"whhhaaat?! She's crazy - requesting an old-school Vegas lounge singer to sing a pop song!!\" But oh no. I'm not crazy. Because moments earlier, my friend told me that he heard Jimmy sang Royal yesterday and he was blown away at his rendition of Royal. So of course, my expectation was very high.  Jimmy read my request note, chuckled to himself and said, \"Oh man. I'm still working on this song because there's a lot of backup singing and I'm a one-man show.\" So Jimmy then journeyed on to another oldie and finally, he turned on something from behind him and started the first notes of Royal. I was ecstatic!  Jimmy had modified this song to make it his own while still keeping True to the original melody.  This man is a genius. I LOVED this version of Royal! Where do I buy a CD of this particular song?   Later that night, I was blown away again at Jimmy's musical ability when he started singing an opera song. Is there a musical genre that this man can't do? Hat's off to you sir! I'm so impressed!  Okay, so if you are too cool for jazz and lounge music, there's a bar area that's on the other side of the wall where you can just sit and have drinks.   Come here for the music, ambience and the laid-back atmosphere. The food, though good, is just a bonus.",

The lighting is low and there is often some live music.  The food here was rich & decadent. The lasagna was saucey & cheesey and noodly; all in the best way.  They also give you some little garlic bread bite things with marinara for a complimentary appetizer and those were a delight.  Very cool place & we've come back many times & had great experiences on each visit.",

I had a New York strip with grilled veggies and M had pappardelle bolognese. The steak was done just right and grilled veggies a perfect companion. And the pappardelle bolognese... was too large! It will make a great breakfast for two.  We will definitely be back.",

Ordered to go Bootleggers today, a feast fit for a king. when i arrived to pick up my food i was greeted with all smiles and was given my bagged up food promptly. When I got home I opened up the bag to see that my salad and anti past was missing. I called up and they apologized and asked what kind of dessert they could get me complementary. I arrived to pick up my food and the awesome dude Andres opened everything up to make sure I had what i needed and everything was perfect, including my cheesecake ;D. I've always been a fan and will continue to be a loyal customer and guest as long as I remain in LV.",

We also tried the Eggplant Parmigiana --Lightly breaded topped w/mozzarella cheese served w/angel hair & marinara sauce; it was also good.  The third dish we tried was a Grilled Chicken Breast which was a tad dry.  The dinners were served with a house bread and a tomato basil dip. For side dishes we tried the Insalata di Caesar, an order of Grilled Broccoli, and a dish of Sauteed Italian Zucchini.  With the exception of the Grilled Broccoli, the sides were fine.  The broccoli we ordered was a no show and ultimately came to the table late after we reminded the waiter.   And when it arrived it was burned so black as to be inedible.  We notified the waiter and he comped us the dish which was nice but the broccoli probably should never have rolled out of the kitchen in the first place.    Overall, the service was friendly and adequate but not particularly expeditious.  The place was clean. The portions were generous and the prices were reasonable.",

The bartenders both looked like deer in headlights the entire time we were there. There were no more than two to three other guests at the bar also. We couldn't get the bar caddy's to properly fit at the bar when our food arrived... the bartenders answer was to try and stick some napkins under it. Almost impossible to get their attention anytime we needed something! We ended up moving our entire lunch ourselves to a high top table so we could eat more comfortably. We were never asked how anything was or if we needed anything else. When we asked for the check all of our drinks were on the tab even though my boyfriend played while we were at the bar. When we asked the bartender, he said he  thought he saw my boyfriend put 40$ in and not the 100$ that he really put in, I guess he begrudgingly took one drink off our bill. Apparently that was the only thing this bartender had noticed our entire visit.  We are both locals , born and raised. We have good memories from the original Bootlegger on Maryland Pkwy.  This was such a disappointment!!!  The food was just ok. Not great , and over priced. 22$ for pasta on the lunch menu! If I'm going to spend 60$ on lunch , there are a ton of other great restaurants I'd rather go to  Next time I'll make the drive to Giuseppe's instead ! Family owned and much better quality and price !!!! Maybe they have a better staff for dinner or grave service. But I don't think we'll go back to try it again!",

Then I ordered Chef Maria's Veal Saltimbocca and don't regret a single moment of it. Ended the night with some amazing Tiramisu. Shawn took care of us the entire night. The atmosphere was that of an older Italian restaurant. It looked like it was built circa 1940s and it was trapped in time. The service was prompt and wonderful. The food  was so good. The live entertainment gave it that special touch. I'll certainly be going back for more!",

Kristin started off with some Calamari and the Wedge Salad... Also some garlic table bread with marinara sauce. I'm already slightly buzzed and I am ready to EAT!!!  The bread and marinara was SO good.. I TOTALLY filled up on it... The Calamari was delish - Can't really go wrong with this dish! And the Wedge was totally good and I'm really NOT a fan of bleu cheese. At all! It was QUITE tastey though!!  I am a GIANT seafood love and this dish immediately caught my eye on the menu: Seafood Diavolo \"House Specialty\" Clams, calamari, shrimp & mussels cioppino style over linguine in mild, medium or hot spicy tomato broth... OH. MY. GOD. SPICY HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH!!! It was NIIIIIIIIIIIICE and spicy and had SO much seafood and FABULOUS flavor!! I ate about half of it since I filled up on the bread before it actually arrived... I had the rest boxed up though and BC thoroughly enjoyed it himself - we cannot wait to go back and get our grub on with this dish again!! NOM NOM NOM!!!!!!  Seriously. We are totes going back in like, four days! I also hear the pizza is great so I can't wait to try that too!",

It's almost like there's a history of Italian people in Las Vegas needing to eat at odd hours.  But of course, such things don't happen.  The good news is that if you're hungry for Italian food, you can get it at any time of day or night.  One of my fellow attorney/paramedic colleagues and I went last Thursday evening.  As with almost anyplace in Vegas, the service was perfect.  We split the fried ravioli appetizer and really enjoyed it.  The bread was also excellent.  The small pieces of bread dipped in garlic butter with a side of tomato sauce were a welcome relief from the usual garlic breadstick.  The chicken parmesan was a perfect ratio of chicken, mozzarella cheese, and tomato sauce.  Well worth the visit -- and beyond convenient both in terms of location and hours.  And the atmosphere is perfect. It feels like something right out of the Rat Pack days.",

Mike had a Fratatta ( fantastic )both Dennis and myself had eggs with the best breakfast potatoes ever. We additionally shared a side of freshly made bacon. Plus; let's discuss the French Toast dipped and coated in Captain Crunch. Yes that is correct. Here is the bottom line.. Great for an early morning business meeting. Great for fresh home made breakfasts.(lunch and dinner too)",

I really enjoyed the restaurant. My wife ordered a chicken dish I can't remember the name of it but it was good. She said that she could taste a little fish.  She didn't know if it was leftover from now pan before hers it was cook.  She said she really enjoyed her salad.  I ordered the pasta bake that had penne a delicious sauce. You're really good.   I ordered it with for shrimp, I thought they would put it in the pasta bake but I came out on the side. The shrimp were huge and delicious.  My kids for the ravioli. They thought it was great.  One of my girls when ask gave me two thumbs up.     The downside of this place was our service. When we walked in the girl wouldn't get off her phone. She asked me several times the same question and I never repeat myself how many there were. Then we had a gal seat us and disappear. Apparently her shift was over and the guy that took over her shift was late. So it's out there awhile before we ordered.     We will definitely go back. The Ambiance and the food or fantastic",

They have gambling at the bar and overall it seems like a classy, nice place. The pizza and salad were really great and tasty and the pasta was pretty good too. I'm only giving it three stars because some (not all) of the waitstaff and bartenders tonight were incredibly rude to our group. We had a very large group of extras doing background work for a tv show and we were placed through out the restaurant and bar to set the scene. I heard the waiters bitch about it twice and the bartender kicked some extras out of their spot to let some other rude patrons sit there. That's unacceptable behavior! Whether bootleggers was paid to host this place for the show or offered it up for great exposure the staff shouldn't be taking it out on us background. If they have a problem they can take it up with the managers when the event is over. You can't kick background out of their seats when they are being filmed for so many reasons, most important being continuity. If it were me she would have told to move I'd have told her off and to take it up with someone else. She let her patrons disrespect the background extras as well, incredibly rude. Not to mention the drunk girl sitting by herself (not part of the background group)  they clearly over served that kept harassing extras.",

It's just a constant mess of tourists, even if there are some really good restaurants along the way.  Bootlegger is a pretty casual place. Nice atmosphere to it, though. Tables aren't too close, it's not too loud.  The wine list isn't the most extensive or diverse, but it makes due. You'd just love to see some more international flavor, though.  Also, the bread was okay. Not great bread - it's kind of in little squares. I prefer a big fresh loaf coming out of the oven personally.  For the positive - my entree was fabulous. I had the pappardelle with bolognese.  Sauce was spot on, and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The portion was really good size, especially for the price, so we definitely left full.  We ordered creme brulee for dessert, though in fairness, I was so full from everything before, that I couldn't give it an accurate assessment. The texture was right, though haha.  To top it off, our waitress was fabulous. Great personality, great recommendations, not too pushy.  There are a lot of restaurants in Vegas to try. I won't make a special trip to Bootlegger every time I'm in Vegas, but I would definitely come back here.",

    "text": "24 hour very good Italian Food.  Very Vegas, family-owned.  The interior is reminscent of old Vegas, with a family and history that has seen the city evolve.  They feature live music from time to time, including jazz musicians from Cirque du Soleil shows that get together and have jam sessions.    Their graveyard menu is very affordable, good portions, and conveniently located five minutes away from the madness of the strip casinos, right down the strip.  The first time I came to the Bootlegger's Bistro was for a work event.  I had a cocktail and with a few friends, ordered up a hot and cold antipasto.  While the cold was very decent, the hot antipasto was DELICIOUS.  I enjoyed it quite a bit and it had the proper amount of seasoning with very decent proportions.  The bar drinks are slow during normal business hours but during the late night hours service at the bar is great.    Their garlic knots?  Delicious.  Could eat them all night.  And complimentary, to boot.  Their lasagna was excellent but moreover, their SAUCE is fantastic.  I'm very particular about marinara sauce, and theirs was very well done.",

    "text": "I was looking for a change of pace from the typical Strip hotel coffee shop menu.  I was craving some italian and Bootlegger was reccommended to me.  The restaurant is located south of the Strip, about 10 minutes drive south of Mandalay Bay.    Ordered lasagna and  minestrone soup.  Also got some comlimentary garlic rolls that were pretty decent. The soup and lasagna were merely okay, not really stand-outish.  Filled me up but nothing special.  Overall, I would say that Bootlegger is an okay italian place that's open 24/7 if you're craving a late nite fix, but not really a destination place.",

    "text": "We asked our resort where to eat for dinner on our last opportunity to do such and they gave us a VIP card to the Bootlegger which was about a 10 min walk from Tahiti Village where we were staying. The card was our choice of a free app or bottle of wine. We were seated right away which was great because I was cold from walking in a dress and heels to the place and was pleased to get to sit right away. It is a 24 joint with a wonderful atmosphere. I loved hearing the singer/piano player throughout the meal. There were several groups there for birthdays and such and he sang to them. The table next to us had several people at it and they must have ordered a whole cheesecake for the birthday girl. We chose the wine even though the waiter said he recommended the apps and said the wine was bad. I disagreed and enjoyed it. We chose a white Chardonnay. Maybe he just thought it was cheap but I liked it and my husband didn't complain. It was a wonderful pregame to the Silverton we were going to after dinner. The waiter told us about our favorites and said if we came with the classics on our mind that was fine but that they had some unique things too. I went with one of the unique ones and it was yummy. I don't remember the name of it but it was a chicken rolled in salami with cheese and came with a nice side of pasta Alfredo. I loved it but didn't finish. My husband got the Lasagna and liked it too. I didn't bother tasting his because mine was so good but offered him some so he could try it.He liked it too. I just had a wonderful time getting buzzed and enjoying the scene while eating one of my favorite types of food-Italian! Price wise-not cheap not expensive. Depending on what you got it could be expensive but my dish was $24 for the unique dish. Rick's was less for the typical dish. We enjoyed the free wine greatly and was too full for dessert. The cheesecake from the other table was tempting however.",

We started out with the insalata which was very good the scampi was delicious and the breading on the calamari was fantastic, didn't care fir the fried ravioli. We both ordered the ribeye medium. Both were a little overcooked but good the mashed potatoes and the spinach were very good. We finished up with my favorite dessert, creme brulee; this was not up to par. The custard wasn't set properly and the brulee wasn't torched correctly what a letdown.   As far as the service goes it was just so so. We asked for the tv by our table be changed to the ball game only to be told the remote has been lost for months and we asked for steak knives when our entrees were brought out and after 10 minutes or so I had to get up, find my server and ask again.",

    "text": "I, as the late night guru, am required to review Bootlegger's. On the south end of the strip, Bootlegger's is an Italian 24/7 restaurant. I would love to give this place five stars but I believe that taste should play a big part in ratings.   So here goes, start with the positives. The location and ambiance are excellent. Parking is plentiful but scantly lit. Upon entering past 1am, as I do constantly, you have to ring a bell and be buzzed in (Something I really have grown to love, reminds me of old Vegas etiquette. If there were a password, I would have given this place an automatic 5 stars). Bootlegger's eating areas are dark, candle lit booths, very awesome. The service was definitely impeccable, each waiter introduces themselves with a business card, and pretty much never leaves you unattended.  Now, the food. *sigh* I expected much better after all the reviews I've heard and read. We ordered the lasagna, a tomato/basil pizza, and pomodorro. The red sauce is old style, heavily spiced but still tastes like it's missing something. The pizza was decent, dough was soft yet crunchy with the same red sauce used on the lasagna. The pomodorro is what disturbed me, a simple recipe that's hard to ruin, the tomatoes were passed there ripening. I am willing to give it another try, it may have been that their tomatoes turned and got into all the sauces in my last visit, but we'll definitely have to see.  Give it a try if you need a different spin on 24/7 dining which is seriously why I love Las Vegas so much.",

We arrived with a large group which had many from different walks of life to include at least 1 waiter from competition.  I was shocked to learn that their early dinner choices came with salad included but since we weren't there during that time,  salad was not included with the meal.  My date and I had chosen to order iced tea which cost $3 each,  we did not get a refill throughout dinner. I had the Pollo Angelo which was good but not great and at $24 I expected great.  My date ordered pizza which had a disclaimer of taking 30 minutes to cook abs which he tried to order early so we did not delay anybody else's meal.  We had to ask for a bread refill several times with only receiving the requested refill once, again a sign of an inattentive waiter like the iced tea.  We ordered the cannoli for dessert and for $7, I expected more wow with the taste (presentation was fabulous). And since we were part of a big group,  18% gratuity was automatically added to the check,  which I felt for service was closer to 15% with even that being generous for the service provided.  I understand we were a large group but I felt treated like a guaranteed gratuity. Dinner took 2 and a half hours from being seated to being finished which again felt a little excessive.  I understand that people have off days and perhaps that was the case for the waiter but I will have 2nd thoughts about giving this place a 2nd chance.",

We were brought these fried balls of dough that were accompanied by a marinara sauce of some sort.  They were pretty oily, but because I was hungry, I grabbed the smallest one on the plate.  I chose the linguine with white clam sauce.  When it arrived, it looked like linguine with canned clams poured on top.  There were 4 fingernail sized clams in their shells, but that was it.  The rest of it looked like canned clams.  A big difference from the same dish I recently ordered in Seattle, where there were a ton 'o clams, all in their shell.    Kudos to our server, who was very nice and polite.  But the food?  Just don't order what I had.  Should'a gone to The Yardhouse....",

Last time I went there my friends and i were coming at lunchtime and had been running errands all day, so we were a bit disheveled.  Not in a bad way, but with wind blown hair, jeans and tops.  The front door person wanted to seat us in the bar and when we informed her that our friend was under 21 we needed to be seated in the dining room.  As she lead us to the dining room she was getting a \"look\" from who appeared to be a supervisor who said (quite loudly)  \"BAR SEATING\" and she let him know why we would not be sitting in the *i'm guessing* more casual area.  My friends and I are all also heavily tattooed females, and the look on the waiters face as he approached us was very disgruntled.  We ordered our food, kind of odd choices since we are vegetarians.  we ordered appetizers and salads, all to please come out at the same time.  The waiter never returned to our table, not one time.  The bus boy did his best to fix the errors in our order, half of which never arrived at all, he managed to make it turn out ok.  Being in a service (tipping) industry as well, all three of us each personally gave the busboy an over 20% tip for his friendly service.  I will most likely never go there again.",

There was such a variance in reviews that I was skeptical because in that scenario I usually side with the one starers.  My experience.... Bootlegger bistro def has a vintage feel, not sure if it's that \"old Vegas \" feel people talk about constantly or the decor or the older clientele and piano playing guy singing our favorite Sinatra tunes and hits of the 80s. Anyway, calamari was delish ( not too fishy and gross like Kona grill)- I just wished they had an aioli dip because I'm not that into marinara. My linguine and clams with white wine sauce was really delicious in every way. It was made perfectly. This is a dish that is either terribly gross or absolutely superb. They definitely have a superb linguine with clams! So good in fact the members of my party were all eating of my plate to sample and get seconds of delicious pasta. They aren't even seafood people so that says something. My friend had lobster mashed potatoes which may have been a limited special but were equally as amazing. The tiramisu was good but definitely not the best I've ever had and the cappuccino was a must have. I didn't try the NY steak because I don't like meat but everyone at my table said it was really tasty. Only minus- the food took somewhat long to get to us which was ok because we were watching the entertainer sing, eating bread nuggets and debating over which song we should request. I'm a creature of the night and love the dim lighting. I wonder if its this way during the day? That would be awesome. Overall, great place to take a date or anyone you want to eat with in a dim lit intimate atmosphere that's not awkwardly quiet.",

My boyfriend got a seafood pasta and it was not good...it was waaaay too salty.  Well...we hadn't been there for about 5 months and I had forgotten about his bad experience and apparently so did he.  We went there the other night and the service was great as usual, but the food was entirely tooooo salty.  My manicotti tasted strange and was not a typical manicotti.  My boyfriend's meat ravioli was so salty that he couldn't eat it...nor could I.  Unfortunately, we won't be going there again.  It is a great place to have a drink and lounge with friends since they frequently have entertainment.  It's a very charming place.",

I mentioned this to the waiter but he wouldn't honor the prices even though I showed them to him on my iPhone. Oh well - food is pretty good but took a while for it to come out. We came around mid-night and there were pretty much only bar patrons. The personal pizza was great though. It's huge! Wife and daughter had the vegetarian lasagna. Would we return? Only if we were in the area. It's not worth a special trip out there.",

Last Saturday during dinner, we were surrounded by groups of locals celebrating birthdays, etc.   Bootlegger doesn't serve high-end Italian cuisine, and they don't pretend to. The classic menu items are reliably good, and the prices are reasonable. My husband mentioned that we wanted to share a salad and an entree of spaghetti and meatballs, and they split them for us very nicely at no extra charge. I'd suggest asking for their plain bread, which has a nice crunchy crust: Otherwise, they'll bring you butter-soaked bread bites for dipping in their tasty marinara sauce -- the plain bread was much better.",

Our server was pretty nonexistent and not very friendly or accommodating. Service was slow for not too busy a night. Our bus person Miguel was an absolute delight! He should have been our server-he acted more as our server than the other person. My meal was overcooked and took too long to actually enjoy the meal in its entirety. The server even mentioned that they had the same problem two weeks prior and the manager should do something about the meal and take care of it. Nothing was done, nor was an apology given for improperly cooking my meal. The Piano player was good and played requests. It seems this place tries to live off of its past reputation and did not make a conscience effort to improve let alone stand up to the standards that the family started so many years ago.",

Started with eggplant fritti which is lightly breaded eggplant with marinara sauce. There might have been a hint of cheese in it but it was so tasty and fresh. A great starter.  Next I had spinach fettuccine primavera which is broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, roasted garlic and zucchini with pine nuts in a light broth. There was a nice flavor of garlic through the dish complemented but the fresh taste of the beverages and the deep sweetness of the tomatoes. Served piping hot this dish exceeded all expectations and really reminded me why one can have a vegan dish and lose nothing over not having meat.  Had no room to try the dessert which was disappointing.  Additionally service was prompt, quick and courteous.  My only criticism if I have any was the place was heated too high which made the atmosphere a bit uncomfortably warm.  But very highly recommend.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place so much and if it wasn't for a horrible service/inattentive wait staff I would give it four stars.  We had a server named Aaron, hate to call him out by name but watching how his co-workers mingled with their tables to ensure they had drinks filled/ their appetizers/main courses came out correctly I have to say we didn't get that same level of professionalism.  We were sat by the hostess who said your waiter will be right over. 10 mins later we flagged down a kid carrying a pitcher of water and asked who or waiter was? \"I don't know but I will have someone come over right away\" 5 minutes later Aaron came over asked if he could take our orders?   Didn't apologize for ignoring us for 15 minutes or even try to explain he was double or triple sat, he just carried on like it was normal protocol to have a table sat and ignore them.   We wanted to start with a drink, an appetizer. We should have guessed what was going to happen when the GF asked if one drink had Tequila or not. Another 15 minute wait for him to find out and bring my beverage and another 10 minutes for hers  After drinks were ordered we ordered an appetizer and was told \"I'm not sure if we have any of that left, let me go check and I will be right back\" this time he was only gone 10 minutes and said \"we can make that for you, do you still want it\"? Well yes that's the whole reason we sat here and waited for you to come back!   If you are counting that's 40-50 minutes and we have only been given two glasses of water and a soda.  We had empty drinks on our table about 40% of the time we were there. Waiters, Busboys and others walked by our table and ignored our requests for assistance to get refills or our bill. (Actually a younger kid seeing our distress did get us refills and our to go boxes) I know the other waiters had their tables but a simple \"I'm sorry I will send Aaron over right away\" would have been nice  We had some good food but sadly not great. I had the Seafood Diavolo, the seafood was fresh but the sauce was a weak bland sauce when I had ordered it medium I was expecting it to have a little bite. If I can convince myself to patronize them again I will try it hot.  The Antipasta Classici, was what he was worried about not having any more and was quite exceptional. Best part of our meal was a plate of sliced meat and cheeses?   Our server only came back once to our table and that was to give us our bill. There were empty tables everywhere and we should have been given more attention, just like the tables around us.   The best part of our meal was the guy playing the piano and his sexy singer belting out classic lounge act songs. The singer bantered with a few tables making them part of the show. The two of them were  a nod to classic Vegas and actually did elevate our experience from a horrible one to a mediocre one.  We may be back but it sadly won't be the first place I recommend to my friends or family.",

Appetizers, we had fried calamari and a fried vegetable platter. My entree was 16oz NY steak and shrimp scampi and my gf had the 10oz steak and shrimp scampi. For dessert, we had cheese cake and tiramisu! Full course! what what! haha  - Easy parking. South of the strip. Near South LV outlets - Elegant vibe. Pianist playing classics. At one point, there was a live singer. I was surprised they did all this on a Wednesday.  -  Great service. Multiple servers. Nice recommendations. Quick refills.  - Italian margarita gave me a light buzz. Nice amaretto flavor, sweet and sour.   - Funny that we order American and not Italian. It's an Italian restaurant.  - Calamari was average. Salty - Vegetable platter was good. I enjoyed the mushroom and zuchhini  - I ordered my steak medium and it came to me medium-well. Fail. Gf ordered Med-Well, and it came well done. 2x fail. I guess next time I'll order med-rare to get med! haha - Otherwise, steak was seasoned nice. Not the best steak, but no real complaints - Scampi was amazing! Flavor was strong. Loved it. Wish it came with a bit more. I'm not sure if I'd pay $12 for it myself though.  - The potatoes were presented in slices stacked on top of each other, which I have never seen before. Delicious taste and wonderful texture.  - Cheese cake was ordinary. Far from Cheese Cake Factory. More like buffet-style cheesecake.  - I had a great time. Nice ambiance. Video poker if you're bored. Good recommendation for a fancy dine out.",

The private wait staff was courteous and prompt! Always making sure no one was without a drink. The food... let's just say no one left hungry- WOW! Our guests could choose from fettuccine alfredo, penne marinara w/sausage or chicken parm... ALL so delicious! They even offer to-go containers. The private room had its own entrance and patio.

I love the bread bites they bring out. They are addictive.   The service is a bit hit or miss. I've had some great and some less than par. Never so horrible I have been turned off.

The service is wonderful and all of the servers I've gotten weren't afraid to talk to you.   The food is great and the portions are decent. I usually have left over when I eat there. You also get free garlic bread squares while waiting for your entree to arrive. Be careful not to fill up on those! They are delicious! It's fairly pricey but a very good place to take a date that you that to impress or want to celebrate an anniversary with. I love going there.",

    "text": "Went to this place Sunday night with a coupon for a free bottle of wine.  This bottle was cheap variety,  $6.99 value.  However it is added to your bill for $25, then they tax and tip it +18% and plus 10%, and then take the $25 off.  You ultimately pay $7-$8 for it.  Let's get to the real issues.  My wife is very particular about raw meat. She eats nothing less than little pink with brown.  I went through the motions of having the waiter describe what medium is, (red with pink), and medium well is (little pink with brown).  My wife was delivered a raw steak bleeding on the plate.  We asked for flash fry... Plate came back extremely hot... It was microwaved.  Classy.  I was charged $12 to add shrimp scampi to my steak.  My steak came with an onion ring and 3 asparagus. No Scampi.  When the check came I asked about the $12, and he insinuated the scampi WAS on the steak.  This was soooo insulting.  I had to prove it did not come on my steak which was easy to do as I ate less than half as it was a tasteless NY bone off.  They have no steaks Bone-In.  The Antipasto salad  was also an issue.  I don't like olives, and didn't eat any and was fine.  My wife however threw up the whole night mostly olive and tomatoes... Maybe from the raw steak??? Who knows... My poor wife...  Lastly the auto gratuity for my family with 4 kids. (4, 6, and 8 years old)  Seems tacky to force gratuity on such a bad experience and mostly kids at the table.   It took over 10 minutes to get the check adjusted as he started over the bill to adjust the tax and gratuity.  Somehow with 4 kids the bill was over $200 after adjustments.  :( (reminding you there was no alcohol on the tab as the wine was \"free\")  Don't go here.  The food isn't that good, service even worse.  Waiters with memory of a goldfish and then insulting you by not letting you give a deserving tip.  With service this bad, forcing gratuity is the only way they would get tips.",

Not particularly well staffed at our 10:30am arrival, one friend left in a lobby that the waitress admittedly \"doesn't really check\" since most enter through the bar, it was with all soon accounted for that we were offered a cozy four-top alongside the windows overlooking the an outdoor patio, the rose lighting making for challenging pictures while music from the 50s played from speakers neither too soft nor too loud.  Admittedly timing the meal to coincide with the eleven o'clock transition from breakfast to lunch it was with both menus presented that eyebrows raised to bargain-basement prices, the pre-tip total of just over $80 a veritable bargain for such a table twice overflowing with food.  Starting off the day with breakfast, myself particularly famished after a late night and early morning run, it was in a trio of plates that opening bites were entrusted, a Pancake and French Toast pairing showing the former simple and fluffy while the latter was sweet with custard and cereal even before adding pure maple syrup from home, the Benny surprisingly excellent with crispy eggplant crowned in perfectly poached eggs and housemade red sauce.  Offering hot bread with each course, the first a basket of toasts from which ciabatta proved lovely for sopping up sauce, it was with a sizable basket of buttery garlic knots that the lunch portion of the morning kicked off, the fried ravioli stuffed with finely ground meat teaming with spices while the doughy pizza was only fair-to-middling compared to the restaurant's 'signature' lasagna, the enormous wedge topped in meat sauce and mozzarella more than enough to share.  Doing a lot of the legwork during on the lasagna when it came for dessert I almost decided to opt out, but spotting canollis made in the Italian tradition one couldn't help but order a trio, the crispy tubes elegant with bittersweet chocolate chips playing off cream tinged in orange zest.  ***  Far better than many traditional 'checkered tablecloth' spots in town with favorable pricing considering the quality of the food, suffice it to say although I'm not sure I'd invest in the crowd and cost of dinner I'd strongly encourage anyone looking for breakfast or brunch in a Vegas Classic to give Bootlegger Bistro a look.",

The food is at best mediocre. I dont think anything here is homemade, it tastes very packaged and fabricated. My wife ordered the eggplant and found tin foil mixed in, not good. I had the veal parmagiana and it was definitely prefabed frozen before it made its trek to the table. The sauce with the angel hair pasta was fair. Two in our party ordered the Orange roughy, pretty dry. Both said the Fettuccine Alfredo was good. Our Server was so blah and mechanical it was distracting. The workers who fill the water bring the read should be the Servers, they're excellent! All in all, a great place for tourists from places, where they know nothing about Italian food. I compare this place to Casa di Amore, another place that obviously gets lots of folks from the convention center on business",

    "text": "Erm, I wanted to love this place, but to say I did would be a lie.   It's open 24/7, so maybe it's crazy to expect fresh fresh food.  However, the prices on the menu fooled me into thinking I would be getting something amazing. I ordered the spinach alfredo primavera and my husband ordered the lasagna. Because of allergies, I asked the waiter to exclude pine nuts from my pasta, but this request was not granted.   It only took about 5 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food. Although this is usually it good thing, it was evident that it was already made and just put on a plate. This is exactly how it tasted. We truly expected to wait a bit and enjoy the music from the harpist, but we had no wait.  When the food is delivered, I instantly noticed the pine nuts and didn't bother complaining. I took a bite without devouring a pine nut and I was interested in correcting my order because it tasted bland and old. I feel like that plate is a joke, just offered in case a vegetarian shows up. It came with vegetables that were soggy and candied red peppers. These candied peppers actually made me chuckle because I never expected to see them in the pasta.   Alright, alright, I will calm down. Now onto the lasagna. There was nothing really terrible about the lasagna. It was pre-prepared and tasted like \"mom's\" left overs. They cut a really thin slice and laid it on it's side, similar to how a cake wedge on it's side would be. Each bit contained a different bite of the lasagna, either all ricotta or beef. I don't agree with the presentation of the dish, but it was definitely the delicious.   My husband and I ended up sharing the lasagna and did not touch the spinach alfredo anymore. We were still hungry and finally got to my favorite portion of the meal. Tiramisu!!! This was delicious, moist, and just the perfect amount of coffee flavor. The display was beautiful and I am craving it now as we speak. We ate dessert and listened to the most amazing harpist I have ever heard, Mariano!   I will be back, but I will come for desserts and awesome music. I'll be skipping the overprice pre-prepared main course.",

We started out with the house side salad and it was absolutely delicious. I tried the house Italian and the blue cheese and oh my! Both were absolutely delicious. Especially with the small garlic knots ;-)  I ordered the chicken scalopini piccata and asked for linguini with extra sauce instead of the fettuccini Alfredo. My husband ordered the osso buco and our friends had the eggplant Parmesan.  The piccata was very tasty and the portion was very large.  I tend to prefer my piccata a bit more lemony, but the sauce was layered while subtle.  The linguini was sadly not al dente; while I did not ask for it to be, I expect good Italian restaurants to automatically serve pasta al dente. That's the only reason I gave this restaurant four stars instead of five.  The osso buco was absolutely outstanding!  The risotto was slightly crispy and the intricate flavour very nicely accompanied the robustness of the meat.  The heavy dark sauce exploded with flavour.  The eggplant Parmesan was traditional prepared and served with one of the best marinara I have ever tasted. Absolutely outstanding!  We ended the meal with tiramisu and hot molten chocolate cake. The tiramisu was light and delicious, but the lava cake was the clear winner - wow!!!!!!  Foodgasmic!!  So if you want a delicious dinner in a great setting with fantastic service, come here!",

She seemed irritated if someone wasn't sure what they wanted immediately.  The food was the saving grace. My Seafood Diavolo was so divine. Packed with seafood and it came extra spicy- like I asked. My main gripe with Italian restaurants is that the rarely do spicy. Also the shrimp were huge and really tasty. Cooked perfectly.   The Sinatra-esque singer was delightful in the background. All in all a great place to dine if you stay away from the bar.",

We went to Black Bear Diner first, but the wait was horrendous. Wound up at the Bootlegger. Had the wife and four kids with us.   Breakfast menu is super simple, but just right. Captain Crunch French toast was great for the kids. The wife had a fantastic omelette, and the pancakes were great. Most of all, the service was fantastic. Claudia was our server and she was great and super attentive. Made us feel like we were at her house for brunch.   All in all, it was super low key (which is a nice change in Vegas), delicious, and great service. 10/10 - would recommend.",

    "text": "Stay away! Looks can be very deceiving. I just hurried home to finish this review. The outside of the restaurant/bar beckons at night with it's pretty lights and False promises. I was craving Italian and it was after 1am. Yelp was temporarily down or I wouldn't have even bothered with this place. The atmosphere was nice upon arrival. We seated ourselves at a booth. The server was pretty nice but his service was so slow. We both ordered the fettuccini alfredo. The bread with marinara sauce which was served right before the pasta was horrid and literally dripping grease. The food came quick but the service after that was really lousy. We waited almost 20 min. for the server/bartender to come back around to ask him for refills on ice tea. The fettuccini was so bland bland bland. I had to force myself to eat it. I left more than half the food on my plate as did my companion, who is not a picky eater. The guys in front of us, at the bar started smoking up a storm. Between that and food, which was not settling well, I wanted to just get the check but couldn't spot an employee which is strange for a bar. I could've up and left and noone would have noticed. Total bill for two fettuccini, two iced teas, (which were $4 a piece) was almost $40. subtotal. The price of the food was not even worth it. I wish I would have bought 2 frozen dinners, Marie Callender's fettuccini alfredo, on the way home and called it a night. It would've been cheaper, quicker, and tasted better, and that's sad. This was the worst Italian meal I've ever had in a restaurant. I've always wanted to try this place. I'm so disappointed. So, $48. later, I feel queasy and compelled to warn anyone with taste buds to stay away. If this was the last place on Earth that served food, I'd starve. No joke. If you really dislike someone recommend this place to them. No that's cruel. Try Carmine's Little Italy. The food is just as expensive, but at least worth it. Ugh! Even my burps are gross.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I too work in the service industry.  Granted there are days where I wish I could be more attentive and pro-active for my guest.  Even when i know I cannot give my best, I make the effort to make sure I own the guest and accomidate them as much as possible.  My performance directly effects my lively-hood!  I may not be a consistent guest of the Bootlegger Restaurant but I have been eating there and brought several guests with me since they were at their old location on Tropicana and Eastern Ave.  From now on . . . I will not refer anyone to the bar whether it is shift change or not.  I came in on a Sunday afternoon at 4pm.  I asked about happy hour and food service at the bar.  The host having no knowledge of the happy hour menu directed me to the bar (totally ok with because I too am a bartender).  I asked the lovely brunette bartender if I could sit at one of the hightop tables - yes was the answer.  I asked about happy hour and dinner food service at the bar - she specified nothing other than she would get me a food menu.  I asked for a wine menu which she got. I waited 10min. to order and I had to step to the bar to order.  I just went downhill from there.  Her replacement Diane came in who was very nice but neither of them were attentive either in taking my order, following up to see if I needed anything, which I had to approach the bar to do (the only thing I asked for was extra vinegar for my caprese salad) and the bar was empty aside for some return guest from the brunettes home town.  Did I mention that when I asked her if I could get another glass of wine for my dinner, her reply was that legally she couldn't serve me because of being off the clock.  This I understand but it didn't stop her when she sat with her friends from her hometown and served them after I had placed my order.  I still had to ask Diane for another glass of wine.  My entree was dropped not even halfway through my salad so by the time I finished my salad, my food was totally cold.  Did I fail to mention that neither the food runner, busser, bartender asked me if I needed anything or even if the food was ok?  I had to ask to have my plates cleared.  During the hour and a half I spent there . . . I have always boasted about the food, since I was a kid.  The service in the dining room has always been great.  I guess that is where I will make the effort to sit from now on.  Bummer!",

The menu is not perfect and I have had to send dishes back on occasion, but nonetheless it's gives me that comfort of home. They have a constant movie running, the God Father, the machines are always bumping though I have never won anything, and there is a crazy bartender with silver hair he is probably late 30 early 40's and he completes the scene. The calamari is bomb, I usually order the linguine with clams in Alfredo sauce. I know you might be hesitant to try it but I can assure you it's so flavorful. I stuff my face in there without a second thought. Is there better Italian places? Sure, but I would rather go to Bootleggers and laugh with that crazy bartender, my co-workers, play the slots and watch my distant relatives get blown up shot and killed on the tv as I watch God Father, I just feel like I am back on the East Coast for an hour or two, nothing wrong with that!",

I stopped in here for the first time and had a very nice meal which started off with the complimentary garlic nuggets.  I then chose the Baked Penne which was cooked perfectly just past al dente and had just the right amount of baked-on cheese on top. The sauce they make is quite tasty as well.  The portion was perfect; not too small and not so large that I felt like a fat kid.  I wasn't planning on having desert but when the waiter said they had Cannoli's with a hint of Grand Marnier in them I could not resist...those were incredible, I loved the slight orange flavor.  Prices are fairly reasonable.  My meal, which included the baked penne, a glass of chianti and the cannoli cost about 30 bucks.  I was a little apprehensive when I walked in and saw a video poker bar slap dab in the middle of the place...\"oh boy, smoking\" I thought to myself.  NOPE!  100% Smoke free!  Nice atmosphere with a ton of old school pics on the wall and very nice and sincere wait staff.  I will definitely return for another sampling of their food.",

We've stayed away for so long because we always ended up with crappy servers who just didn't have time for us ( even with an empty restaurant.)  We went last night for the first time in a very long time. We were blown away by how awesome our server was. (Danny- seriously the best server in any restaurant we've had in a while.) We weren't rushed in and out like we normally are. We was friendly,  always on top of filling our drinks. He was just the best. (Thanks Danny!)

And nothing outstanding for the price either. Portions I think are big or at least enough to share.  The main thing with this place is the service, I wanted to give 2 1/2 stars. The service is just slow, inconsistent and dreadful. By the time we got our food we didn't care and just wanted to leave. A formal complaint was actually made at the end.  Save this place to try on a busy date night when they got something going on and it might be worth it. I don't suggest coming here for a quick lunch or entirely for food itself. It has location, a vtg vegas feel atmosphere and I don't drink but it also has booze too. However just for the food and the service alone would not be worth the trip.",

I understand that we were seated outside, however, I have eaten at other restaurants before where their patio seating is CLEAN...I guess it doesn't happen at this place.  Overlooking the dirtiness, I wanted to give Bootleggers an opportunity to prove my impression wrong through their food.  As the waitress came out, I saw that her uniform (which was black) was quite dirty also!  Her black apron and shirt was smeared with some red sauce (spaghetti maybe?) and white powder (cocaine maybe?)...Really not appetizing.  I did notice that the inside dining had very dim lighting, so maybe she didn't realize that her uniform was that dirty.  Nonetheless, it's not something I want to see.    She took our drink orders and handed us the menus.  Even those were DIRTY!  A friend of mine had a coffee stain on his menu and we all had water/sauce stains throughout the pages....They should really clean those!  We should have left then and there, but NO!  I wanted to let Bootleggers redeem themselves through their food.  The waitress came back quickly with our drinks, complementary mini garlic rolls, and took our food order (she was quite friendly btw, which was a plus).  I had the mozzarella caprese and deep fried cheese ravioli.    The garlic rolls were not really warm...well, let me take that back.  They were warm on the outside and cool on the inside.  Meh, let's say I wasn't a fan.  The mozzarella caprese and deep friend cheese ravioli were both were pretty good.  Nothing exciting or exceptional though.  The caprese needed more balsamic glaze.  They just squiggled three lines on the plate.  The cuts of mozzarella were nice and thick, so was the tomatoes.  The deep fried cheese raviolis came with marinara sauce.  There was a good crunch to them.  However, once again, these dished were forgettable...which is better than being bad dishes, I guess.  Overall, I don't think I will be returning.  However, I did enjoy the weather :)",

    "text": "Did some research on a nice Valentine's Day dinner off the strip. Wanted to try something different. Read the reviews on Yelp about Bootleggers and most seemed pretty good. After visiting this place I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.  The food is terrible. I'm not sure I ever had a worse Italian meal. Everything on the cold Antipasti plate must have been purchased at a supermarket. Nothing fresh! It came with pieces of Oscar Mayer style Salami and Bologna, canned artichoke and peppers. Sadly that was the best part of the dinner.  Ordered the Chicken Marsala with Ziti and meat sauce. The Ziti with the meat sauce comes on the same plate as the Chicken Marsala which isn't the best way to do it because the two sauces run into each other. That was the least of the problems with the dish though as the Marsala sauce was a watered down mess. The meat sauce wasn't much better. The thick piece of chicken wasn't cooked in the correct way either.  My date ordered the Veal Osso Buco and when they brought that out I thought it must have been a joke. Four tiny medallions of veal that I'm not even sure was on the bone. It looked and smelled so terrible she didn't take a bite. I did however and regretted it as it tasted like a TV dinner Salisbury steak.   To be fair the place was packed, the service was good, they had a great lounge singer and people around us seemed to be enjoying their meals.  However there must be better Italian restaurants on the strip. A couple of locals recommended Battista's Hole in the Wall if your looking for old school Italian place that actually serves good food but unfortunately I didn't have the time to try it out so I can't confirm.  I will sum up this review like this-If your looking for a great old school Italian meal similar to what you get on Arthur Ave in the Bronx NY then this in NOT your place. If your looking for a authentic looking Italian place with good music and Olive Garden style food then you found your place.",

    "text": "I've been to Bootleggers a few times over the years. The food is pretty good but it is on the more expensive side because you're paying for the experience versus than the actual food (which is why I'm giving them 2 stars vs. 1). However, my last trip to Bootleggers will be my last due to their terrible customer service.  A co-worker stopped by after work on a Friday for dinner and drinks. Everything took way longer than it should, but it was pretty busy and there was a performer on stage so we didn't mind too much. The problem came after we left when I checked my credit card statement and realized they charged both tickets to my card. No big deal, I figured I would just call and Bootleggers would fix the problem since it was their error; boy was I wrong. After getting the run around from the manager for three weeks, I finally got the name of someone in accounting who finally looked into my concerns. After she researched it, the manager finally called me back and told me that they would only take the extra charge off my credit card if my co-worker called Bootleggers and gave them her credit card information because we were still liable for the charge. Then they told me I had to be the one to tell my co-worker about the screw up. They wouldn't even take responsibilty and call her themselves to resolve the issue.  I work in customer service and under no circumstance would we ever ask the customer to fix something we screwed up.",

I didn't get to actually sit down and eat here, but I did utilize their handy takeout section!   They offer everything imaginable on the menu that pertains to Italian. From calzones and pizzas to pasta and paninis, I'm pretty sure there's something for every appetite on the menu which could be a very bad thing for someone with awful menu anxiety like me! Ultimately, I went with a delicious Bootlegger sub with meats, cheese, tomato and olive oil. The guy at the counter suggested that I order it hot which I did and I was happy he suggested it! Next time I'm in Vegas, I will have to make it a point to visit this little Old Vegas restaurant off the beaten strip-path!",

As you walk in you feel like your back in the 60s with the big leather circle booths for 2 or 4 which gives it a nice romantic feel and periodically there will be a man playing the piano and singing it's really the perfect setting. There food is amazing it really doesn't matter what you get you'll be pleased. This time I got Alfredo and gnocchi's and it was amazing the sauce was thick and creamy and the gnocchi's cooked to perfection. The servers are great always around to get you what you need and the refills keep on coming without you even having to ask. The price is very reasonable especially being in Vegas on Las Vegas boulevard 3 miles from Mandalay Bay. If your a local check this place out! If your a tourist take uber or a taxi (which usually is only $5-$9)  and you won't be sorry. You will not find this kind of Italian food on the \"actual\" strip I can promise you this I've been looking! And this by far is the best!",

    "text": "Just for take out purposes.   Ordered two of their boneless chicken breast paninis with the pesto sauce over the phone, came in 20 minutes later and unfortunately they made two chicken parmesan sandwiches instead. No big deal, easy fix, cashier was very nice about it.   What kind of rubbed me the wrong way was the manager rushed in, started correcting my order on their point of sale terminal, slammed her keys down, and sped past me, through the dining room leading to the hallway, and never even once smiled or acknowledged the mistake. While I understand the floor was a little busy at the time, I would have appreciated somewhat of a acknowledgment.   Still waiting on the food, and the manager just ran out the takeout doors, cigarettes in hand and lighting up as I type, right outside the door. Still no food yet. I can't make this up. This is incredible.  Based on reviews here, it seems like a nice place that truly wants to give that vintage experience, however I feel that my experience missed the mark.  Edit: So disappointed. Menu advertises the chicken pesto panini as coming with lettuce and tomato. Check the picture I uploaded. No lettuce, no tomato, a smudge of sauce, and barely any fries. All this for 11 dollars is seriously upsetting.",

    "text": "I actually have a lot of experience at The Bootlegger. I've eaten here many times and hosted events here. I will break up this review into two parts to touch both ends.  Dining wise: The Bootlegger's history is well entwined with Las Vegas. This family owned restaurant goes back generations. When you come in, you will be greeted by a mechanical host looking right at you. I can't lie, it has fooled a few friends of mine. The main restaurant is split into two parts: a bar and a more standard dining area. The Bootlegger is open 24 hours and makes decent drinks. The food is traditional Italian with hefty portions. When in doubt, ask the knowledgeable staff. They do know their stuff. One thing I always get is the tiramisu. So good.   Host wise: They have two main rooms you can use. The smaller room can hold up to 60/70 people but they will be a little crammed in there. If you ask they can serve buffet style to your guests as well as plated meals. My only problem with the room is that it is pretty narrow for larger events. Not much room to socialize.   The largest room they have comes equipped with a stage, sound system, fully stocked bar, and plenty of tables for up to 200. It is a beauty of a room!",

We both had a glass of the house Cabernet and a lite lunch pairing. I had the eggplant parmigiana and a house salad- both were delicious! The ambiance and decor were great, but our service was not. Our server was corrina, who was a little rude from the start. She had no personality and kept trying to rush us along to order when we first sat down and we're trying to catch up a little. She also passed our empty water glasses multiple times (with a pitcher of water in hand) while refilling other tables..  Overall, the food and wine was great, but there are many great Italian places in vegas!   The service here would definitely keep me from returning.",

Dark!  But you get used to it quickly.  Just be careful wandering around until your eyes adjust!!!  Eat in the dining area, not the bar area.  Very elegant, nice, comfortable (especially the booths), and sometimes they have live music!!  Not too loud, just right!!  Food?  Exactly what you would expect.  Italian perfection, great service & wine list, and a lot of options.  It's all good.  The antipasti appetizer was especially outstanding. Get the large one!  Their unique bread is outstanding as well.  Throw a dart at the menu... you can't go wrong.

My only complaint and the reason it is 4 stars and not 5 is that I have never had a good waiter as compared to other upscale restaurants in town.  They are forgetful. You often have to tell them your request twice and I always run out of water and have to flag someone down. However the food especially the lasagna is amazing so worth the visit for sure.",

Only one thing bugged me - If you're going to have a VIP club, don't require someone to print the email that was sent. It's 2017, people have smart phones.  Good grief. I got lectured over the fine print for a \"free\" $9 appetizer. Apparently it's only free if you print the email and bring it in. Not if you show the email on your phone.  So keep that in mind (all you folks that don't have printers at home because, duh, it's 2017) and don't bother ordering that \"free appetizer\" Also - the cannoli's have pistachio nuts instead of chocolate chips. So there's that...",

My group got ripped off over $1000! We were told they would charge based on the actual guests number. But when it came to refund for the guests didn't show up, NO NO NO refund! -- I offered prepaid, because I wasn't sure if I'd stay there until 10 pm, and I wanna make sure both my guests & restaurant could be taken cared properly. Never know I'd be punished for my honesty! And never once I was informed (neither in writing nor verbally) that once payment was made, there would be no refund.  The managers first offered in credit only for next group. Then without discussion or our consent, the GM decided to send a little over $300 check (w/no credit) & told us it's either their way or highway! What a shame! Because the owner was accuracy very nice. Unfortunately she got blind sighted by her lying managers. What's worst? The GM denied our request to speak to the owner! Among all the groups I brought to restaurants, never once had situation like this before! Guess we all learn new things everyday!",

We had made a reservation beforehand so the table was ready as soon as we arrived and there was also live music playing, which was nice and really set the atmosphere for us!   Garlic knots were provided for us as our bread, which was delicious & definitely different from the usual plain breads you would be served at any other restaurant lol. We had a hard time deciding what to choose since the menu is vast & filled with so many delicious sounding foods! But our server was very informative & let us know the favorites including their house lasagna as well as the seafood pasta.   Our party of 8 waited almost an hour for our food to come out so it was getting pretty late but good thing they kept giving us more garlic knots to keep our stomachs happy as we waited. I decided to go with the Salmone which comes with salmon ravioli and I wasn't super satisfied as I had hoped - it looked delicious but was really salty & the ravioli was a little tough to cut through. Other than that, everyone else in our table seemed to really enjoy their dishes & cocktails.   The restaurant is divided into a dining area with the live music and the bar that is open 24 hours a day. Our server was friendly & very accommodating which made our dinner a satisfying one.   Overall, it was a nice first time experience but do expect the dishes to be more on the pricier side.",

The food tonight was worth 4 stars, however the service was a completely different story.  I came her with a friend who has been coming here since the 70s and he said we had to sit at the bar because there is a bar menu which basically gives you half orders.  We sat at the bar and there were two guys behind the bar...we got Fred as our server....  What we quickly discovered about Fred is, it was obvious Fred never met my friend and I know he never met me; so when Fred was all done catering to the regulars, then we got taken care of.  Fred was good when we sat down, he brought us menus and drinks and then we sat and watched Fred cater to the regulars.  When he ran out of regulars to take care of he came back to us.  I have to say this was one of the worst experiences I've had here.  The food was good, but the service should have been better.  My money is just as green as the regulars..to treat me different because you don't know me, gets you the rating above.  I highly recommend the food here, I just hope your experience with service is better then ours was.",

Elizabeth was our wedding coordinator, and she went so far above and beyond for us that we can't thank her enough.  We didn't have a very specific idea for our wedding reception--  We just knew that we wanted it to fit our budget, and to be fun.  Liz took that and ran with it!  The setup was great, she found napkins to match our wedding color (Regency from David's Bridal), and she was able to handle all of the timeline stuff wonderfully, including things I didn't really think about.  Overall, many of my guests came up and told me that this was a truly outstanding wedding, and Liz at the Bootlegger (and the Copa Room) helped make that our reality.  11/10 would recommend.",

He had a segment at the Bootlegger Bistro where he featured an entree of veal parmigiana with a small portion of spaghetti. The veal was crispy on the outside, and the dish was placed back in the oven for a short period to add some color to the cheese.  Well, I had dinner there the next day at 5:00 on my way to a 51's baseball game. I ordered the veal parmigiana since it looked and sounded so good the night before! First, it came with angel hair spaghetti with a thin red sauce - I decided that I don't care for angel hair spaghetti any more! Second, the breading was not only not crispy, it was soggy! Third, the veal was virtually tasteless.   I would have given it zero stars, but I didn't want any readers to think I forgot the grade. It was barely a $10 meal vs the $32 that was charged for the veal!",

The ambience was good, just like you usual Italian restaurant. But it's very spacious inside, I think you can even host banquets here.  Their mini garlic bread was delicious. I ordered chicken Marsala and Alfredo. While the chicken tasted good, I kind of wished they gave a little bigger portion. Alfredo was also good but was too rich for me. For dessert, we got tiramisu. Let me tell you this, they have the best tiramisu in town! (Out of all that I've tried so far) it's not too sweet, it's nicely moist, and right amount of coffee taste. I can eat this all day.

However we always enjoyed the food enough to return every few months. Last night that all changed. We requested the bar and were seated in the middle back where a table shouldn't even be. A man who sat next to us had to apologize for his ass touching our table, even though he was not a big guy. It felt like those squeezed in bar tables at Cheesecake Factory that everyone hates. No privacy at all.   The food was decent, we ate, got the bill and paid, leaving a 20% tip of $11 on a $54 bill (including the tax.) When I got home, I noticed on the receipt that the suggested tip for our bill was $10.35 for 15%, $12.52 for 18% and $13.80 for 20%.    I'm not sure what kind of math that is, but I do know one thing: it's shady as shit and I will never eat there again. There's plenty of good Italian restaurants in Las Vegas. The food isn't that special that I could overlook an attempt to swindle and cheat me to get a few extra dollars. Sad part is that many people use those tip cheaters (now a literal term) as a quick convenience. Tipper beware!",

I worked in an Italian restaurant for 14 years of my life and I have PTSD (Pasta Trauma Stress Disorder) and seriously just can't even with Italian restaurants even three years after leaving the food service industry.   I loved this place, inside I felt like a NY mobster.  Round high back booths to plot your hits and tables with actual tablecloths to strong arm your lackeys.  Classy. Dim red lighting.    Bread nuggets on point with marinara.  Way better than breadsticks! Oh that fettuccine Alfredo...as my friend promised pretty spectacular.   Dessert.  Normally I can pick one.  Usually one stands out.  But this place had three. I had one there and one to go. I had the creme brulee. Fuggedabowdit. It's not worth the calories...I mean I ate it because I paid for it, but it was not that great. Lemon drop cheesecake was to go...and oh yeah that's where it's at!  My waitress was a little dingy but pleasant.   When I want Italian I am going here.  Went a second time: get Alfredo to dip the bread in! Had baked penne...so good! Lemon drop cheesecake...so good!  Had Oscar as a server...Phenomenal!",

Very knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and it's owners.  I had the ravioli with house marinara, and this is not Chef-boyar-dee. Good sized with amazing stuffed meat. The marinara is very good.  Complimentary bread with a specific bread marinara type dipping sauce.  To be honest, Alfredo made the experience that much better.",

We were seated at a table in the corner and got to enjoy some live music for the majority of our visit.   We started out with some bruschetta, in hindsight I do not think I would order this again. The complimentary garlic bread and marinara was more flavorful in my opinion.    I had the bucottini alla carbonara had a rich and creamy sauce that really complimented the salty pancetta. The large serving was enjoy to fill me up and have a full meal to take home. I also had a garden salad which had very yummy house Italian dressing.   My husband loved his vegetable ravioli, and my mother in law seemed pleased with her lasagna.   While we did not have to wait to be seated, the restaurant filled up quickly after we arrived.  Our waiter did forget to bring out a drink that was ordered but that did not out a damper on our evening, and other than that minor hiccup service was excellent.   The Bootlegger serves up classic Italian fare in a cozy, old school setting. Located just south of the Strip on LAs Vegas Blvd., I recommend it for locals and tourists alike.   Note: Open 24 hours. Military discount (10%) offered.  Yelp Reviews 2018 38/100",

You should be repaired that it can get a little bit loud on certain nights but there are sections of the restaurant that are quieter than others. It's not the loudest Italian restaurant in town for sure.   I do enjoy the spaciousness, location and friendliness of the workers and ownership at bootleggers. It has a family run sense that makes for a great local restaurant.   Everything I've tried here has been 5 stars.",

Had the Fettuccine Primavera (asked for oil and garlic instead of the chicken stock) and it was wonderful, brimming with fresh veggies and lots of garlic. Companion had the Cappelini Pomodoro Rustica which was also tasty. The garlic bread to start was nicely enhanced by the marinara.  Also made fun by the memorabilia of a restaurant that has seen a plethora of stars. Plus slots and sports on TV of you are interested.  Definitely will stop again if I'm in Vegas and looking for a meal before flying.",

Can you give negative stars???  Service was mediocre at best. They clearly either didn't put our order in or someone took one of the plates in our order, which is more likely since 2 out of 3 dishes were room temperature. The hostess at one point brought a second appetizer and tried to play off that all was ok even though a table sat appx 20 minutes after us received their meals before we did. And with thier price point averaging $25 plus the meal should at least be warm.   They took my meal back when I said that it was room temperature, put it into an oven or warning device, plopped an extreme amount of sauce on it, and brought it back. The pasta (manicotti) then had that wierd crispy, rubber like texture.   We heard that this place was good, so maybe it was a bad night or the recommendation came from someone with low standards, but the experience definitely left us under impressed with this Vegas staple.",

The restaurants does not split checks and service was very slow last night including the waiter forgot to bring a drink for one of us in our party of 10 In addition we all attended the show in the Copa room where they had a tripod on one of the tables and a guy blocking the view recording the show with his phone through the entire show",

Garlic bread things were some kind of biscuit dough with no flavor. Not even remotely Italian.  I'm not really writing about the food more so about the service. My server was Alex S. according to my receipt... I worked as wait staff in restaurants for many years. I don't ever want to have to write bad reviews about staff because I know how hard everyone works. But I was his only table and he rushed EVERYTHING from the second I got there. And kept calling me MISS which is really rude. He acted like he couldn't wait for me to get the heck out of his table the whole time. From the second I sat down he didn't want me to have any time to decide what I wanted to drink, rushed me about what I was doing going to eat, and pushy about it, and while I was figuring out the tip he kept asking me if I was finished yet!! It's not like I'd been there forever taking up his table or something. He was just plain rude. I will absolutely not be back here as a result.",

I am not to sure about the history in this restaurant but there is an actual mannequin at the check in desk. I am not sure who or what it was suppose to represent or resemble. But it sure did freak my kid out.  Onward to the food, after we sat down our waiter took our drink order. Which was nice, afterwards our drinks were brought along with some garlic knots. I would say those garlic knots where so addicting and probably my current favorite item on the menu. After reviewing the menu, me and my son decided to order the lasagna, my son's option was a meat one and I ordered the vegetarian one. Now the kids dishes are pretty good size, and enough to fill em up. Now my lasagna was decent and not the greatest, my broccoli on top of my lasagna was so thick and crunchy it was hard to eat together and I really didn't understand why it was prepared that way. I definitely will not order that again and will probably try something else. I just couldn't get pass the weird texture and bland flavor.",

They've all agreed this place serves great food!   This last visit, my party ordered the lasagna, beef and cheese raviolis and fettuccine Alfredo. We were all beyond happy with our selections. Even more happy with the generous portions that three of us went home with leftovers that we enjoyed later that night for dinner.   Make sure to order the calamari. It is cooked to perfection and has great seasoning on the coating. Also, as good as they are, try not to fill up on the little complimentary bread bites given pre-meal. Those things are little crack bites that will make you want to keep plopping them in your mouth and not leave room for your entree.   Our waitress was delightful, very energetic and enthusiastic about working at Bootlegger and it's delicious food offerings. She let us know that everything was made fresh daily starting at 7 a.m.   One thing I didn't know is that this place is 24/7. It's a little far down on the Vegas strip, but I promise it's totally worth it!   Note: They take reservations, but only same day reservations and can call as early as 11 a.m.",

    "text": "It's been a few years since popping into one of my favorite Italian places in Las Vegas. The old school style still exists but I'm afraid to say, it's lost its charm and quality in the kitchen.  Being raised in NY, we pride ourselves on quality pasta dishes. Unfortunately, the veal parm I ordered was dry, the sauce, marinara was just okay but seeing it served with angel hair pasta told me that the owners & management have taken their eye off the ball. At least you're not paying LV strip prices.  That said, if you don't mind loud drinks at the bar, average service and average food then why not give it a shot. My guess, you're at least 50% assured of getting a decent meal.",

    "text": "We all have a place where we swear has \"The best Italian Food Ever!\" Well, I did too. Then I came here...   Why is it so good, you may be wondering?    I wish I could describe exactly what was it about this place and the food that immediately made it my #1 spot for Italian Cuisine. I shall attempt to describe, yet I feel like my attempts at capturing the magnificence of this establishment with mere words on a page will not do it justice, but I will try  1) Food -  Obviously this is my number one reason for falling in love with the place. I have had great Italian food, that I assumed was amazing....on the first bite of a Spaghetti with Marinara sauce, the simplest form of Italian you could go, the flavors of ripe tomatoes, fresh herbs danced around in my palate. The texture of the al dente pasta was impeccable.   I have been to numerous extremely expensive Italian Restaurants in Vegas and New York City...which while the food was great, it didn't shock and amaze me like the food here.   I like to think that I have a refined palate for tasting foods yet I could not, for the life of me, put my finger on what made their sauce so unbelievably perfect. I will have dreams of this Marinara sauce for years to come. It is light, yet robust with flavor, no puree or canned tomatoes here I assure you.   2) The ambiance - Every place you go to nowadays has the same style of decor and feel. You feel like just another body of mass in a place. Somehow this place made me transport back to the golden era of Las Vegas. When judging by the pictures online, I assumed it would be a fancy place, but not in the good sense, more in the \"snobby and stuck up\" sense, I was wrong. I felt like I belonged here (as much as a Latino can feel like he belongs in an Italian joint). I truly adored the booths and tables, so intimate, I can't wait to bring a date here.   3) Staff - I wish I could remember the name of my bartender/server, he worked the Night Owl shift on Friday. He made me feel right at home, as if we had been buddies for years and i'm not talking about \"playing the friendly bartender\" so he could get tips, I could honestly see that he loved what he was doing. Very polite and down to earth person.   As we talked he demonstrated the amount of respect he has for the food  they serve and for the family, it is very rare to find a place where the bartenders/servers actually enjoy working at. It's a sign management must be doing a good job and taking care of their people.   Conclusion: I feel like my entire life has been a lie. What I imagined was amazing Italian food, turns out was just good. I'm upset it took me 2 years in Vegas to find out about this place (damn you locals for not telling me about it). Make this a bucketlist item. You won't regret it.",

He was outstanding in his attentiveness and friendliness.  He gave us some great recommendations for our meals.  He was truly great.   Steve also mentioned it was their 65th anniversary in Las Vegas.  It is the oldest run restaurant here even though it's changed its location a few times.    I tried the Salmone which is pan seared salmon w/seafood ravioli in a lemon butter sauce.  Delicious and so tasty!  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  It was light, flaky with the sauce that complimented it perfectly.  Before the entree was brought out, tasty Panetti bread is brought to the table with the tomato basil dip.  Delightful!   Included with your entree is a soup or salad.  The caesar salad was great.  There wasn't too much dressing drenching the toppings.  It was nicely done.    Would I dine here again? Absolutely!",

Well not some crappy amateur crap show that is for sure. Amazing entertainers throughout town come to bless us with their amazing talents along with the house band on Monday nights. We were lucky enough to hear professional singers belting out any and everything from Sinatra, Jackson 5 and... Yes... Even a little Pink Floyd action. You can sit in the bar and have an amazing and attentive service or if you prefer sit at a table for a full dinner experience.... Oh the food  So the food... Yum!!! First... I LOVE the garlic knots with sundries pesto they serve upon seating. Next, I am a ridiculous lasagna snob and this one sure fits the bill! However, I also highly recommend the stuffed mushroom appetizer. Takes a little longer but so worth it since they are made to order as opposed to sitting around all day. And believe it or not... The ribeye is amaze balls! I recently took my dad to a celebrity chef's steakhouse and practically needed a chainsaw to cut the meat. And two days later pops ordered a ribeye from Bootlegger that was amazingly tender and juicy... And for half the price even!!! Also good to note, they are open 24/7. Although I have never had breakfast there, I have heard it's pretty damn good!",

I remembered hearing about this place and decided to call to be sure they still were serving food-specifically pizza and THEY WERE!!!! Upon arrival there were only a handful of people in the bar. We sat down and were promptly greeted by the friendly bartender who then took our order. Our pizza was everything we wanted and more. DEEEELICIOUS!!! Starsky and Shane took very good care of us and were very attentive.   Since my first experience was so great I decided to bring in another friend the very next week. My second visit was Oct 3 9:28pm. A little busier this time and there was a male and female bartender. We sat there a few minutes and the female bartender passed by a handful of times but did not acknowledge us. Then, the male bartender came over from the other side of the bar to greet us and gave us menus and apologized for the wait. He then offered us tasting of wine (Ravenswood Zin) that we LOVED and ended up ordering multiple glasses of throughout our visit. We split an order of Lasagna as we were not terribly hungry, and it was PERFECT. Michael was a phenomenal host who went out of his way to give us a great experience.   Can't wait to visit a 3rd time!!!",

It's down Las Vegas boulevard in more of a \"local\" area and not too far from where we live, so my sister and I love going.  The atmosphere gets you right away. I can't even explain how this place is decorated...you need to check it out yourself. It's so gorgeous and they even have live music, I'm not sure when that is though.  We always have the nicest service, I went a few days after getting my wisdom teeth out once I could eat normal food and our waiter suggested something soft. It's always pretty fast service in there, even when it's super busy.  The bread they give you at the beginning with the marinara sauce is to die for...I always have to be careful because I'll end up filling on that before my meal is brought out! I've had the calamari too and it's a delicious appetizer.  My favorite favorite thing is the ravioli with the rose sauce. I wish every Italian restaurant had that rose sauce. I don't know what it is but it is so dang good!! I definitely recommend this place to locals and tourists alike.",

The sauces are acidity and some of the orders are large portions so they can be shared. A reservation is suggested especially in the later part of dinner time because it's crowded at the restaurant and bar due to the entertainment.   If you go to 5or 5:30 dining you can go into their Copa room without paying cover charge and the shows are like the lounge shows small and intimate. Great place",

This place is the talk of the town, so it's been on my list for a while now and I'm glad I was finally able to make that journey to the south end of Las Vegas Blvd.  My boyfriend and I turned it into a spur-of-the-moment date night, which are my favorite kind of date nights. At first glance, I was nervous that we were a bit underdressed in just t-shirts and jeans... (Y'know how some famous Italian joints can be)... The building had a string-lit courtyard and I could hear a live band covering ol' Blue Eyes from the parking lot, but to my surprise, this place is the classiest casual spot I've ever been to. I mean, it seemed to be the neighborhood's after-work spot, which makes me like it even more. Nobody cares which fork you use first!  The menu was incredible! Pricy, but there's so much to choose from. The boy and I decided to go out on a limb and try something new as an appetizer: Braised Pork Neck Bones. Tbh, it kinda weirded me out at first but the pork was so delicious and fell right off the bone, all while soaking in a flavorful broth that begs to be sopped up by toasted garlic bread. We also ordered classic bolognese and manicotti as our entrees, which were so yummy and came with the biggest portions - Perfect to take home and nuke for lunch the next day.  All in all, I'm a fan of the Bootlegger. Decent prices for delicious food. I'll be back!",

It was a Friday night and the earliest reservation was 8 PM (I thought that was a good sign) so we decided to go a little early for appetizers at the bar.  The bartenders were great and we ordered the stuffed mushroom.  They were amazing and the only reason I give a 3 instead of a 2.  Stuffed w/ sausage and swimming in a delicious sauce.  The piano player was very good, entertaining and gave the place a great atmosphere.   We were seated for dinner and that's when the mediocrity began.  Our waiter was curt and not friendly at all.  Maybe the end of his shift and we seemed like a bother.  The garlic bread did come out immediately but they were stale and the sauce bland.  I decided I would have one of the specialties and ordered Marie's Saltimbocca.  It sounded delish- salami stuffed veal with a mushroom sauce.  It was just OK and I was not impressed.  The edges were burnt and the sauce was a basic marsala, nothing special.  The fettuccini Alfredo  severed with it WAS delish. My husband ordered the chicken parm.  He said the sauce was bland- nothing special.  This morning he has a stomach ache.  So we were disappointed overall and with all the truly great Italian places in LV we wont be back.",

    "text": "This was not my goal. I had heard good reviews over the years of the Bootlegger Bistro but our visit on a Wednesday evening at 10:00 pm was not good for several reasons.   1. First, the (very) good part. The history of the Bootlegger is alive and well on the walls and the decor. We sat in the old booths where apparently many of the early Las Vegas icons may have sat - fun to chat about. But better yet, one (or more) of the video monitors plays continuous clips of Las Vegas in the 60s and 70s - again, fun and entertaining.  2. Now, unfortunately, the food was simply bland. No Italian bistro should have bland food at any point, it's a fundamental flaw or here, 'the kiss of death.' When an Italian place serves a generic tasting sauce, it's time for one of those TV shows to enter the picture and accomplish some major changes.  3. We ordered Eggplant Parmigiana and a chicken dish, Pollo All Angelo. Each of ours dishes had no taste to it other than a series of generic ingredients, of the canned type, placed together and heated. The pasta was a bit undercooked but okay.  4. At one point the two servers both disappeared for about 5 minutes after another group came in. The bartender was 'quietly' yelling, i.e. arms up in frustration, looking all about, making the gestures along with some additional bar guests seated nearby.  5. Unexplainable part. I had ordered a Coke, it was normal. Then middle of the dinner, I ordered another one, refill, it was strangely different, much more syrup-like.  6. In sum, the food was ~ I sincerely dislike saying this ~ bland at every point, the service was fast-food like, meaning adequate but intermittent definitely, but the atmosphere was pleasant. Unfortunately, that is not nearly enough to return. I would rather eat great food at a dive or 'hole in the wall.'  7. As for some of the other reviews I see here - I highly suspect one or two as possibly being 'affiliated' with the place. The words just seem too simplistic in one case, too broad in another. Now, if I hear there was new management and an improved menu at some point, we may re-visit, but no time soon.   Strange thought here - knowing that so many famous people had eaten at the Bootlegger in the prior locale, and hearing about this place for, well, decades, I was looking forward to a good dinner with my wife. It simply failed. The irony is that I had just shared with my wife that Olive Garden doesn't essentially cook anything, no grills, but uses microwaves to re-heat all the pre-packaged items sent to each store.",

No pink lemonade or beers because their pipes were broken. I think our waiter is actually a bus boy. (103 Starsky) Ordered 2 double tall drinks.. I asked if they were talls and he clearly heard me and walked away. Charged for double talls  but received shorts. $16 each. Gave us our check 15 minutes ago, has yet to come back to take it. Had to walk to bar to get waters.. In short don't come here. Would have given 0 stars but that's not an option.",

I went there thinking, \"ok, i haven't had dinner and lunch was blah! and so they better have some good italian food, after all, it is an italian bistro?\". So I logged on YELP and did my research and my heart was set on the tiramisu. Well, I get there, and from the street, the place looked very nice, it had christmas lit trees and had a \"bistro\" feel to it, i can't really describe it.   Anyhow, I walk in and the place had a great ambiance. The scheme was a dark rich red color and black, and had that \"gangster, old las vegas, but classy\" feel to it.   Seating:  I sat myself, since my friend was already there. Be prepared to make some new friends for the table set up is not like your typical restaurant table for 4 kinda setting, its more like table for 20 type setting.   Music: Live Blues music! it was awesome!  Food: I had the Classic Spaghetti with Sausage. Just try it, you will not be disappointed. I freakin loved my 2 sausages.. best sausage i've had in a while.. (get your head out the gutter boys and gals) it aint that kind of party up in there lol.. ha! I had the bruschetta with fresh tomato and basil, although i wanted the portobello and roasted peppers, unfortunately, they  sold out! (I was there at 9pm). They gave a free half dozen garlic bread with marinara sauce.   Wine: I had 2 glasses of Pinot Noir.  I never got the MENU for the wine list, so I don't know what they had. I just had the waiter rattle off the wine they had. Which was not a big deal since I knew what i wanted anyway. But it whatever Pinot Noir that was, it was good. =)  Oh I must say,  I was so full, I forgot about what I had gone in there for, the TIRAMISU! crap! So now I have a reason to go back one more time! =)",

Usually my boyfriend and I eat here late at night (I'm 21 he's 19), I would say we've been here about 3 times after 11 pm. And the food has always been solid. Nothing great but not totally disgusting. We go because it's one of the only spots open late that serves pasta. We also go for the late night specials, because regular priced items are way too much for the quality of food. This last time we were there a few weeks ago, they checked our IDs because supposedly you have to be over 21 to be there past 10? Wtf? So we left not understanding how we could've been there so many times but this one time they decided to check IDs.   Today I went with my family (6 of us) and almost everything was wrong. First our waiter was yelling the whole time and constantly talking over us when we were trying to order. Got our orders wrong, probably because he wouldn't stop trying to correct us and make upcharges.  My mom got orange roughy and it tasted like it came from long John silvers. The pasta I got tastes better at Olive Garden. This place is also INSANELY overpriced for the quality of food. Maggianos is better, food and customer service, and a slightly less expensive.   The food is mediocre at best. Pasta at mama depalmas is better and way better priced. The good parts about the meal was the bread, fresh and delicious. The mussels were amazing as well! The spicy tomato sauce they were in was great. Also, the magherita pizza was pretty good too, even though it has shredded cheese, which makes it just a plain cheese pizza. Nothing crazy special to come back for and certainly not for price.",

Food, wine and service were fabulous. Desserts too. Evenings have a real life piano singer. Highly recommend and especially if someone is at the strip and wants great food and a short drive south from the strip. Great place for a group. My group all rated it 5 Star. An Uber or Lyft would be nominal to get there. It's on Las Vegas blvd near the south outlet stores. Shop and eat. They have a great lunch menu which has smaller portions and includes salad. Lunch does not have piano singer. They do have great service and a great place if a business type lunch. They have these little bread poppers and marinara sauce that are so good. A lot of history in this place. I think it said since 1943. Nice to see that this day and age.",

Such frequent check ups from servers (4 diff ppl attended us) had us finishing dinner in less than an hour. Food quality was fair if not pricy for it's quality but cheaper than other Italian restaurants. Tasted like a lot of their ingredients came from cans; garlic knots had too much thyme n not enough garlic or butter. I won't recommend lasagna, house wine or cocktails (especially sangria). Pastas, calamari, stuffed mushrooms were ok, not too salty, but had better from Olive Garden. Our fav was cream sauce that came w stuffed mushrooms. Used that as dipping sauce than their meat sauce.  Best part is that the place is open 24/7 at easy access location. Tho, I'll stick w Casa Di Amore on Tropicana.",

Pizza did not even arrive until we were almost done with the pastas.  Lasagna was okay (not really worth the money), spaghetti meatball was super salty, fettucine alfredo was decent.  People seems to rave about the pizza but we felt the crust was horrible (almost like a frozen pizza).  Secret Pizza in Cosmopolitan is still the best!  Their complimentary bread tasted like it had been sitting out.  I would not come back here again.",

    "text": "From the snippets of conversation we caught around us, we gathered that this 50's-era Italian lounge attracts locals. The night we went, a live crooner entertained & impressed, his voice a perfect copy of Sinatra's.    Between inhaling mass quantities of complimentary garlic bread (if only to sop up every delicious bit of marinara) & polishing off an appetizer of beef/pork raviolis (with yet more marinara), it was difficult to take more than a few bites of my entree: eggplant parmesan.   Positive comments all around for his shrimp cocktail & flavorful ribeye, its sauce & accompanying mashed potatoes, in particular, garnering praise.   I remember feeling indifferent about dessert, probably because 1) im not usually a chocolate cake fan & 2) I was too full to appreciate sweets right then.   I'd venture out to the south end of Las Vegas Blvd for another go at excellent Italian fare in a cozy setting.",

The server was amazing, and very knowledgeable about the menu. We wanted a salad, with our food, but he said the portions were huge, and asked if we wanted to share one. Not only did he make that perfect suggestion, but he split the wedge for us. Between the perfect buttery bread bites and the wedge, all four of us were in carb heaven.  I ordered Chicken Focaccia, and it was perfect! The fettuccini that came with it, was light if you can believe that Alfredo sauce can be light. Omg! So good! My husband ordered the shrimp linguini, I think. It looked so picture perfect, but I didn't taste it because I had so much of my own. Our friends ordered the salmon and chicken dish and ate until they couldn't eat anymore!  We will be back! We may need to wear elastic waistband pants, but it's worth it!",

The food servers are very nice and I've even dined in the private dining room before and had nothing but great food and service. Plus you can't beat 24 hr Italian food. Try the pinnettis,(their version of garlic knots), steak and eggs is always amaze and their portions are generous. Last night I had insalata Maria and chicken parmigiana and yum!

I was in the mood for a baked dish and couldn't decide between lasagna and baked penne.  I decided on the house blue cheese salad and their recommendation, the lasagna.  I also had an Italian Mule which was a great start.  The salad was very good, plenty of blue cheese dressing with mixed red and green lettuce.  They brought some bread bites as well.  The bread bites were good, but I added some salt to give them a little flavor.  The marinara dipping sauce wasn't bad but I like tangy or sweet and it was a little bland.  When the lasagna came, it was a generous portion, however it was different than any lasagna I've had before.  Most lasagnas are layered with pasta, cheese, beef or sausage, sauce, then another layer, etc.  This was a large, concentrated mound of meat on the right (probably sausage and beef combined), a lot of cheese on the left (I'm sure ricotta and ?), and one piece of pasta covering the top.  I'm not certain this was the way it was supposed to be or if this piece somehow got cut incorrectly but the flavors were completely separate from one another and didn't have that good lasagna combination of flavors.  It was also too little pasta for a lasagna dish. I ate some but since it wasn't what I expected, I wrapped up the leftovers.  I considered dessert but decided to forego it for another time.  I will try the baked Penne next time and see how that is.  Overall it was 3 stars.",

The outside looks nicer than the inside, in my opinion.   But what you really want to do is make a reservation for the live music that starts around 7 pm. They also have amazing Groupons if you can get one. Service is better than 90% of the places in Vegas.  It's off the strip, so I'd say this is more a locals place.  If you want good Italian on the strip, there's plenty there. Oddly, it's also open 24 hours; however, I've only been for lunch once and dinner several times.   My friend loved her Seafood Diablo, appetizers are good, shrimp was amazing I don't know what they do to it but it's awesome,  wine is always good :), osso buco got an A in my book.  See my pix!",

The family pictures give a sense of being at grandmas house for some good home cooking.    The inside of the restaurant has pictures of Sinatra and the Rat Pack all over.  There's also a piano and someone singing live most evenings.  The servers are properly trained and know what they're talking about.  Wine menu includes everything you might need and the mixed cocktails are strong.  But the food is what blew me away!  I can make a meal out of their breadsticks alone.  They're lightly brushed with oil and garlic and served with marinara.  I decided to get spaghetti with meatballs and it was just perfect.  They used a bolognese sauce instead of marinara and it complimented the pasta really well.  The best part is soaking up the sauce with the bread at the end.  Also decided to order the tiramisu as it was recommended and it was a great end to a perfect meal.    I'm a fan and have added Bootlegger to my Vegas favorites",

    "text": "place was okay, my group got wings, mozzarella sticks. Personally I got the Italian Sausage sandwich.   The wings were pretty good but aside from that everything else was just decent.   I would say my favorite thing about this spot would be the ambiance. It has a dark jazzy lounge kind of feeling to it. Would be good for a classy dinner date but if you are going solely for food you can find something better",

    "text": "4th year in here for mother's day very quiet spot for mother's day brunch food just OKAY but you can get in quickly and it's not crowed good coffee and you can't go wrong with mimosa' s. But the service I don't know whats up seems like something always goes wrong. It's become a joke where we bet who's order the server is going to forget. First year it was my son's, then my sisters,last year it was mine, and this year it was my husbands.We are all in the industry so believe me I know stuff happens. Server comes back after checking on his order then asked us what he had. Italian Benny another 10 min goes by she comes back and asks if she can get him something else? Huh what how bout just getting him what he ordered. My husband is so nice he said not to worry about. I shared with him no big deal, but not even an apology. Being in the service industry I would have profusely apologized and offer to buy him another mimosas or take care of his coffee or something it just really rubbed me the wrong way!!!Especially because the person picking up the tab didn't even get their meal. Thing is I know he left her like a 35% Tip cause that's what he does. Well I think we are done 4 tries I'm out. Think I'll just make brunch for the family next year.",

Informed the water that I wanted a small portion and he got me a big dish.  I hate waste and will more then likely have to throw the excess away given the hotel we are staying in.",

    "text": "I attended with a large party yesterday and Vito was an incredible server. I'm giving the stars for him and the food was good. However the manager needs to take a lesson in customer service.  He could learn to smile and be less abrasive.    Our service again was incredibly good. Vito didn't miss a thing. He was attentive and didn't miss a thing.    The food was hot and delicious.  Everyone loved it. The large appetizers samplers are $22.00 and can easily serve 4. The chicken picada is excellent.    This place is quite pricey but the ambiance is perfect for a Italian romantic dinner date.",

The food is good but the ambiance and music are why you'd go there. Our favorite server is Steve, who is perceptive, attentive, and also has a great sense humor.",

    "text": "My Husband and I were looking for a place off the strip and we saw the reviews and decided to give it a try. It was our 1 year anniversary and Im so glad we came to this restaurant. Its so romantic! The lighting isnt too low and the seating was so comfortable. We sat in the high-back booth facing the stage, where a beautiful singer sang love songs all night. The drinks were made quickly and were delicious. I had a Moscow Mule and it was made perfectly. The dishes we ordered were the Papperdelle Bolognase and Chicken Piccata. They were so delicious, perfectly portioned, and came with table bread beforehand. Our server, I wish we could remember his name, was amazing and very attentive.  I had such a beautiful night and I am so so happy we came here. :) We will be coming back.",

The girls had the kids spaghetti and meatball which was also very good.  They loved the bread and dipping sauce they bring to your table and so did I.  They have live music on Fridays and Saturdays.  Just a great place.",
