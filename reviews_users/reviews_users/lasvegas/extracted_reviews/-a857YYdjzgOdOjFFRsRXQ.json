    "text": "If you're in the neighborhood of the Paris casino, this is worth a stop to quench your thirst and hang out with company.   How to get there: The bar is located outside on the second floor at the Paris hotel. There is a set of stairs outside near the Paris valet circle/front entrance on the sidewalk near LVB. You'll see an archway to the Beer Park, go under the arch and up the stairs, where you'll find the park. There's also an elevator, which I believe you need to access inside of the casino.   The beer: This is the BUDWEISER beer park. They have plenty of beers on tap, but don't expect local microbrews, coors light, or any of Budweiser's big competition. You can scroll through the pics others have posted of the menu for a grasp of the beer offerings. They also offer mixed drinks & some bottled beers. Although nobody in our group was partaking in the mixed drinks, I watched the bartenders mix quite a few. They didn't appear to be heavy on the pour, but they weren't skimping either.   The atmosphere: We were here on a Saturday around 10pm and this place was happening. It was a good time, and I had a hard time wanting to leave. There was a DJ going, people playing Jenga, a connect four game, people dancing, etc. There are two round bars upstairs right next to each other, picnic tables, bar stools having LVB. While we were there, there were plenty of people, but you could still find a place to sit.   The service: The bartenders were fast making drinks, trying to serve everyone, but there was a bit of an attitude from one. Particularly when I tried to order a Coors Light and was reminded how this is a Bud bar.  We never actually saw a food or bar menu, so without looking at the taps I didn't know what was offered. Also, we were skipped a couple of times to others who had walked up after we'd already been waiting. It was probably a busy night for them, so the mediocre service is being overlooked a bit in this 5 star rating.   The food: sorry guys and gals- we didn't eat there. You'll have to figure it out on your own",

It had misters which really helped with the 105 degree temps outside lol. All the drinks are served in a porcelain like red solo cup. There are backyard games like jenga and connect four which is pretty awesome. They also show ufc fights here which was pretty cool. It's definitely a chill spot to go if you want to relax. The view is amazing, you can see the Bellagio fountains. All in all a good time, but kinda dead. Maybe it was the time of day??? The heat?? Idk it's a good place to check out, chill, and drink a brew. Cheers",

The selection of craft beer was interesting, and after farther review we realized all the beer (or at least 99%) is owned by Budweiser, and this is a Budweiser establishment.  So my one complaint is this:  If you own/produce all the beer your selling, why am I paying $8-$22+ per beer?  Oh right....I'm paying for the view!",

So began problem number one: seated at bar like area facing bellagio fountains and you can't even see the fountains. I could care less about that as I'm a local but I know the market the beer park as having a view of the fountains. The \"view\" is so obstructed with trees, I could get better entertainment from my lawn sprinklers. Next fail: the actual chairs at this s seating. They are narrow to say the least and both myself and my boyfriend almost tipped them at 2 times each. I'm not a big girl either. 5'2\" and 125lbs. So if you were thinking I may have tipped because  fat, that's not the case. Lastly, the service sucked. We sat for 12 mins without even an offer for a glass of water. This was while there were what seemed to be 4 hostesses standing around and ONE server for entire restaurant area. Boo on you BEER PARK. Huge disappointment.",

Lots of TVs as well with multiple sports on.   Beer selection is pretty big. Only a few selections of cider (not a beer fan), but I'm also a lightweight so 1-2 drinks is all I can handle anyway. We ordered the chips and guacamole and a pretzel. Both were pretty tasty.  The only hang up was the service. It took forever to get our drinks, and then I was given a Hef instead of the pineapple cider I ordered. No problem. Mistakes happen, and they let my friend keep the beer free of charge. But by the time our waitress came back to find out/and when she came back with the correct drink, my friends were already finished with their's and ready for the check. Which we asked twice for and also had to track down our waitress to ask the final time.   It may have been an off day for our waitress. So I would give it another shot if my friends suggest it.  The beers are more expensive here than usual, but it's Vegas...usually everything is more expensive on the Strip. That's expected.",

The relaxed atmosphere is a good break from all the chaos of Vegas and they have all the beer you could ever dream of! I recommend getting the sampler, four 6oz glasses of draft beer of your choosing.  Along with the abundant selection of beer, the view was excellent. You can enjoy a front seat to the Bellagio water show and the strip. This view makes Beer Park unique by creating more of an experience than just an average trip to the bar.

Pretty good cocktails.  Nice view of the Strip from parts of the restaurant.  It's as close as you can get to a frat party without entering a frat house.  A good place to go if you like that kind of thing.  Personally, I lost my taste for that kind of thing somewhere around my junior year in college.  I will say that we had a beautiful April evening to enjoy.  How things would be in the 110 degree heat of Vegas summer days, or the 40 degree cold of Vegas winter nights, I can't imagine.

The chicken drumbsticks are a nice twist on traditional wings. Just as tasty but a lot more meat.  Really enjoyed tge music and the vibe of the bar.",

They don't have a printed kids menu but they do have options. Ordered the mini corn dogs. The portions are pretty huge for kids and they were very good. Great place to bring the family and has a baby changing station in the bathroom. Service was excellent. The only reason why they didn't get 5 stars is because their beer selection is pretty weak. There are also some table and board games so it would be a fun place to hang out with friends.",

    "text": "I've gone here once and my husband has been here three times.  It wasn't until the last time that we noticed the CNF.  What is a CNF?  It's a \"Concession and Franchise Fee\" that charges you an additional 4.7% FOR NO REASON.  You get nothing for this fee.  Throughout Vegas, the majority of restaurants do not charge for this BS fee, but Beer Park is one that DOES.  It sucks, because when I was there they actually had a bottle of my favorite beer there which is pretty hard to find.  Will I come back?  No.  My favorite beer is usually $11 a bottle.  Beer Park charged $27 for the same bottle... and then slapped us with a 4.7% fee for NO reason.  Make sure you look at the very fine print to see if your Vegas restaurant charges this fee.  You can find it in tiny writing on the menu.  Then, do yourself a favor and don't attend these restaurants.    We all know how expensive many Vegas restaurants are anyway.  Is this secretly devious fee necessary?  No.  Just like resort fees and having to pay for parking, it's one more way Las Vegas is trying their best to steal every penny from customers and keep other tourists away.  In addition to boycotting, fill out a trip advisor or yelp review about this place.  Post the information on Facebook and Twitter and tag them.  Let the company know what their doing is unethical and thieves like this should not be supported.  It's not the bartenders' fault so please don't take it out on them.  It's the owners and they should be reminded multiple times a day how much money they're losing every day when customers avoid their establishment and go elsewhere for a beer.  What's the best way to let them know?  Take one second to write up something like this online.  It's a shame.  Most customers don't even realize this occurred until the check is given.  PLEASE CHECK YOUR BILLS CAREFULLY.   Ask for a manager.  Let them know you won't be returning due to this fake fee.  Cheers.",

We got here a little after they opened so it wasn't very busy. We were able to score great seats, facing the Bellagio fountains, we also moved to more comfy lounge type sofas after a while. Only downside is that you couldn't get servers to come to that area, no worries, walking up to the bar wasn't bad.  I tried a few beers until I found the one that I loved. They have a decent selection of beers and of beer concoctions. They serve you ice cold water in red solo looking cups and the place is huge.  They have 2 pool tables, it's free, all you do is leave them your ID. They have a connect 4 game, and a few Jenga games.  I enjoyed my time at this place and would have been happy staying all day but we had to leave because of dinner reservations that we could not cancel at the Eiffel Tower.  This is a fun, laid back place to get away from Vegas and its craziness.",

I've never met a beer I didn't like... that's not True at all... but on this day, I decided it was time to drink. Cut the bullshit and just get down to it. So I wandered my way down the strip and stumbled upon a small park, built for adults. A beer park.  My server was named Mya and she did wonderful things. She brought me beers. More than one. She helped me solve my math homework once I was too drunk, and you could tell that she really cared. Like really took an interest in me. Not just the beer I was drinking, but the content of my character as well. And I'm a wonderful person, without question. Please don't question it.  There was something called a Fiesta Salad, and that motherfucker was delicious. It tasted like a party in my mouth... A party I will not forget.   I'll always look back on that day. It was one hell of a park to stumble into while drunk and it did not disappoint.",

BUT - a couple of things have changed.  1) They have this BS fee called \"CNF\" they add to your tab which is essentially a franchise fee they are charging us. I am a bit over Vegas and their fees - and this is another one of them that is something the business itself is charging - not a tax. AND you don't know it until after you get the bill. There are several restaurants/bars on the strip doing this.  My question is - why is this a charge? Why isn't this wrapped into the actual food/beverage costs? Instead - it just creates this angst by being a line item on the bill.  2) Chicken drumsticks have changed. You now get 4 tiny ones - and they are not bbq anymore, they are buffalo. Not a fan.  Other than that - music is awesome, location is awesome, the venue is awesome, staff is great. Great experience.",

My caesar was surprisingly good for a bar. The boyfriend had the spicy bratwurst and liked it. The ribs were okay but my friend disliked her chicken BLTA. Hands down, the best food on the table was the small crock of mac n cheese. This place also had a good selection of beers but at $9 per pint.

Big draw here: #femaledj Lydia Ansel and her violin playing to her disc jockey Club music. Beyond amazing.   The food is gourmet comfort food, Mary-Courtney and Alex were my servers. If you aren't spending $30 per person, you aren't doing it right. This is a place that deserves an exemplary tip because of the attentive servers.",

Best part of this joint is the VIEW! We sat on the ledge looking right across to Bellagio Fountains!  Fish and chip: 5/5 the fish was fresh and flaky and batter was crispy not oily at all. The crinkle cut fries were crispy too and enough to share.   Philly Cheese Sandwich: 4/5 husband enjoyed this. He doesn't usually like pickles but theirs was delicious and perfect with the sandwich. Doesn't come with sides which deducted a star. (We ordered onion rings which looked yummy but the server forgot about them- didn't even say sorry).   Micheladas here are BOMB.  Definitely coming back.",

Lol! If looking for party atmosphere smack on the Vegas strip Beer Park is cool spot! Most of the restaurant is open so great outdoor dining when weather perfect. Plus get perfect view of the Bellagio fountain show across the street. Panoramic view! They have bunch of games for everyone to play from oversized Jenga blocks, air hockey, board games, and more. There one spot most of the games are at kind of lounge/games area. Great chill spot for group. Lots of televisions all of them on sports.  It was our first stop for cousins foodie tour. We ended up getting couple appetizers and drinks kick start the night! The appetizers we got the Chile Verde Nachos and Loaded Tater Tots. Both were good but no \"wow\" factor. The Chile Verde Nachos would recommend over the Loaded Tater Tots. It nice portion of nachos. Just the right amount of toppings that it not smothered. So even once get to the bottom chips still crispy and toppings left. The beer list is pretty solid. Diverse, lot of choices, and something for every beer fan. The service was five stars. Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and awesome.  The only negative is the place is so loud. It not often see my cousins. Its hard to have conversations with group.",

It was exactly the vibe we were looking for. It was fun, casual with a dose of whimsy. We had a late lunch and ordered wings and the carne asada. I thought the carne asada was very dry and do not recommend it.   The patio bar was located on the second floor. It could be very sunny but there are a lot of umbrellas and shade to keep you covered.

The service was slow and very unfriendly. There was an hour long wait at the restaurant we wanted to eat at so we came here for a few drinks. It should not take one entire hour to get one round of drinks while you're seated: we sat down, waited, waited some more, finally got up to get menus, waited, asked a server to grab our server, server comes looking unhappy, we order, wait some more, we get a call from the restaurant that our table is ready and are forced to chug our drinks because in one hour we had JUST managed to get our drinks. However slow they are to get you your drinks they are exponentially faster at taking your money since paying took about four seconds.  I will however mention that the drinks were delicious and all of us were happy with our choices off the cocktail menu, but I would've loved more time to enjoy them since there was about a three minute gap between getting our drinks and having to leave.   Overall: the view is great but there are a million other places on the strip with a nice view with far better service. You can easily skip this place.",

They have many games lying around and there was a giant Jenga that we were playing with.  My friends split the Cowboy burger and loaded waffle fries, my husband ordered the Beer Park Pie and I just had loaded tots.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  The mixed drinks were tasty.   Just be prepared there are no healthy dishes here... all grease and bar food!  But, that can be good every once in a while.    I'd probably go back.

    "text": "This is probably my new favorite sports bar in Vegas!! I can't believe I never realized it was here, right across from the Bellagio where I normally stay. Being the football fan that I am and finally gaining the courage to make a few sports bets, my stepdad and I decided to go off MGM property to watch the game (since the sports bar and sports book in the casinos don't serve food...I mean, how can you watch sports without food??)  Amazingly, it wasn't crowded at all, especially considering the number of games on.   It's upstairs, near Paris. It's like an outdoor mancave!! Sparkly green turf covered the floor, TVs every direction you look, built in heaters, picnic-style tables with board games galore and a hidden receptacle for bottled beverages! The whole thing is outdoors so dress accordingly, but do remember they have heaters :-)  Ladies, there are even purse rings to hang your purse at the end of each table! They have a life-size Jenga, Connect Four, and other fun games that adults would love to partake in!!  We were only craving appetizers since were going to eat dinner after the game. My stepdad got the 7-Layer Dip and I got the Guacamole. Our server said all the appetizers were shareable...see pictures. That guac was not only NOT shareable, but hard to eat out of that tiny container. But it WAS good. I can't wait to go back and try their real food!! Those waffle fries are calling my name...  They serve you with what LOOKS like plastic red SOLO cups and paper plates but...SURPRISE!!! They're actually ceramic or something!! Way cool.  My only real complaint is that our server refilled my stepdad' s beer 3 times but never refilled my soda. I actually had to call her over and ask, even though every time she visited our table my cup was most obviously empty. I get it, free refills don't earn the money.  You can take awesome pics of the strip in either direction.  It's just a really neat place, my new favorite in Vegas :-)  Oh!! They don't have blended drinks but right below them is a little store with just blended beverages. FYI.",

My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this place out and finally did when he saw it on Groupon. Menu is kind of pricey so I definitely recommend getting the Groupon to get your money's worth.   My boyfriend ordered the Kahuna Cowboy Burger ($11.95) while I got the Smoked Prime Rib Cheesesteak ($12.95). Additionally, we both shared a side of Mac and Cheese ($6.95) and Loaded Tater Tots ($9.95). I'd say the best part of the meal were the sides. The Mac and Cheese was so creamy and with a little bit more cheese, it would've been even more delicious. The Bass IPA cheese sauce and the bacon did wonders for the fries. I liked that the fries weren't completely drenched in cheese and sour cream, keeping it from being soggy.  My boyfriend loved the flavoring of the bbq sauce in his Kahuna Cowboy Burger. However, he found his burger too wet, making the pretzel bun soggy. The Smoked Prime Rib Cheesesteak was good, but not amazing. The prime rib was on the dry side and lacking flavor. I had to put some pineapples and jalapenos that came with my boyfriend's burger as well as hot sauce.   I wish I remembered our server's name because she was extremely nice and attentive. When seating us she even made sure that we weren't sitting directly in the sun considering how hot it was that day. Lastly, Beer Park has games you can play, which is great when waiting for your food or even while enjoying your food. This is a great spot to hangout with friends and/or colleagues. I would even recommend it for a casual date.",

After looking over the beer menu, I couldn't settle on just one. Then I found the deal worth getting there. They offer 4 six ounce beers for $14. Any of their craft beers on tap. ANY OF THEM. That is such a great deal, especially if you are going with higher alcohol heavy beers. That is just what I did. My husband and I each picked 4 beers and it was the perfect choice. We were a bit hungry, so we got the mac and cheese eggrolls. To some this may sound weird, but to a foodie like me, this was amazing. House smoked bacon and a three cheese blend wrapped in amazingness. They serve it with several sauces for your liking. It was the perfect bite to go with the awesome beer choices.",

    "text": "My friends and I came to Beer Park for NFL Sunday Football expecting good food and non-stop football. We only got the non-stop football part. The food was honestly mediocre at best.   We started with the Popcorn chicken which is covered in buffalo sauce and cheese, pretty average.   For our mains, some of us ordered the Kahuna Burger which looked great on paper, but just was not what we were expecting. The Burger also comes with no sides so I ordered a basket of Sweet potato fries which were not good at all. Others ordered the Turkey wrap which was also pretty bad. The service was just as bad as the food, maybe because it was crowded for NFL Sunday but still no excuse.  The only Pro's about this place are the TV screens everywhere to watch Football and the great selection of beers.",

Someone contacted me to say I was a moron for writing this (perhaps someone who works there) Let me clarify. I ate at Sammy Hagars one block away and outside without any bees.  Yes there is a problem when I personally witness another couple ask for their check to leave because of the bees buzzing around and the waiter can't even clear the table. Yes there is a problem when I have to move my seat and when the waitstaff admits it when I tell them. Yes it's a problem when there is bee in your $11 drink you want to finish and have to fish it out.   I wish I took a video of the people using their menus to swat bees or a photo of the one swimming in my drink.",

We were sat immediately by a cheerful hostess and then served excellently by \"Karen\". Karen stayed on top of our needs the whole time and tried to keep us longer but alas, we wanted to walk the Strip.   While sitting on the balcony deck we had a great view of the people and cars going up and down the main strip. We also watch the water show across the street at the Bellagio.   There is a stage on the balcony and I was told by Karen that Beer Park was having a lip syncing contest that night at midnight. We got to watch several rehearsals and knew that the event was going to be cool.   We ordered a few small plates to compliment the beer. They were good but not to die for. On the other hand we didn't go into the Beer Park to eat so we were not disappointed",

Though they are priced as if they were imported from the ends of the earth, delivered by golden knights on horse back. Disappointed to say the least.   The food however (priced cheaper than the beer in most cases) was on point. I had the pineapple jalapeno bbq burger on a pretzel bun, amazing. The Gilroy garlic fries with a side of cheese sauce, great flavor. My friend had the guacamole burger. Well seasoned, cooked perfect and reasonably priced.

I understand it's a busy spot so I was patient. When the bartender greeted me, I order my food. I ordered a grilled chicken BLT sandwich with tots. Simply. So 15 mins pass, 30 mins pass, 45 mins pass, an hour. Finally a young lady presents a pilot cheessteak to me. I tell her that's not my order. 15 mins pass, I flag another bartender down as the originally bartender that took my order primarily stayed at the other end of the bar. The bartender  I flag down indicated she would check on my order. 15 mins pass, I get presented with a Philly cheese steak. I tell her again, that's not my order.   The whole time I'm remaining calm and trying to keep my composure.   I gave my ticket and see the lady rung up a Philly cheese steak. I spoke with the other bartender and she indicated that she would put my order in immediately.  I waited 20 minutes and at that point, I was done.   I spoke with the manager, I believe his name was Jake( I apologize if I got the name wrong) but he quickly resolved the issue and comp'd my meal. I continued to remain calm and glad I was able to get some resolution.",

    "text": "Located on the outside of Paris Casino with fantastic views overlooking the strip. If you are in the casino there is an elevator inside of Hexx restaurant that will take you to it. They have plenty of misters for hot days but after awhile it still was a little warm. Tons of tvs but how there arranged wouldn't want to make me sit and watch sports. No great views. Lots of giant games like Jenga and connect four. Thought the place would be a little busy but it was pretty dead Saturday afternoon.   My husband and I split Mac and cheese egg rolls & a spicy quesadilla. Both were just ok. The quesadilla wasn't spicy at all and the shell was a little soggy. Our friends had burgers. They were huge & they said they were good. Our server was new but she did a great job of waiting on us. No complaints.   A little warning before you decided to go here. They are one of very few restaurants on the strip that charge a CNF fee.....concessions and franchise fee. It's tacked onto your bill without warning and before tax so you are paying tax on it too. I was aware of this before I went but still wanted to check it out. So now been there, done that.....",

It's visually one of the best spots on the strip, and it's always very popular at night. If you want great pictures, or want to be around a really fun, rowdy group of folks, come here.   We waited for at least 20 minutes sitting down for anyone to even take our drink order and acknowledge us once we were seated. This is no one's fault: their restaurant was very busy and we understand. However, that's a little unacceptable. The rest of the night went on in a slow, similar fashion. Food was all right, but nothing to write home about.   If they could get more staff, or perhaps train the staff to be more attentive on really busy nights, there would be no issue. Hope to return for a better experience!",

They have two square shaped bars to sit at, but also lots of picnic style tables, and raised pub tables. TV's are everywhere playing whatever sports are on. They also have all sorts of pub games to play. Some pool tables, shuffleboard, etc, so there's lots of fun to be had.   The food was pretty good. We tried some nachos that were tasty. But what I liked about this place was the beer selection. Many of the big casinos just have the same beer selection with very few or no beers from smaller breweries. Beer Park has a much nicer selection and on top of that, our bartender actually knew her stuff, telling me about the various beers and their characteristics. Beer snobs will feel right at home.   Overall this is a great, fun place to hang out and have some great food, beer and do some people watching.",

They advertised this place as a craft beer garden but it's just a tourist trap.   I saw it on groupon so decided to give it a try while I was in Vegas this go around.    Looks pretty with plenty of Tvs for your viewing pleasure. It wasn't to crowded so thought we would pop in and pop out for a quick meal. Got seated right away and that's when it stopped being enjoyable. Took forever for our waitress to come take our drink orders. Took even longer for her to come back to get our food orders.  Beer is expensive here unless it's Budweiser.  When my beer finally came it wasn't even cold. When my cheeseburger came it's wasn't even hot. To top it off you don't even get a side with any entree. Bill for two people sharing a side and 2 beers was 87 dollars. Took about a hour and fifty five minutes to get all of this. Not at all worth the price for the sub standard food and poor service. Save your money and don't bother with this place.",

However, the service is actual crap. A big steaming pile of it.   I think just for us to get one beer while sitting AT THE BAR took a good 15 minutes after placing our order. Then we got to wait another 20 for a water that I asked for and for our food orders to be taken. Mind you, the bar itself had maybe 7 people sitting at it. Additionally, when I told the waitress I just wanted a Coors Light (please, don't give me shit - let's save that for another time. I know it's piss water), she looked at me and smirked and goes, \"Okay. Well. We don't have that, so. We have Bud Light.\" Okay, GIRL, there are about a million other NICE WAYS you could've worded that. Nobody asked for your smirk or attitude around here, so I don't know who you're talking to with that tone.   I digress.  I wasn't too hungry when we came here but I knew I needed to eat something. So, I ordered the appetizer guacamole & chips. Their guacamole is pretty solid, but definitely could use a little bit more salt. Whatever they season their chips with is FIRE. Seriously so good. Takes a regular old tortilla chip and brings it to LIFE.   One thing about Beer Park that really stands out is the view. The view from the rooftop is spectacular, especially at night. Also, they allow minors and there are different games located on the rooftop for people to play with (foosball, giant Jenga, giant Connect 4, etc.).   In the end, it was about $112 before tip for 5 beers and 4 meals. Not too shabby in my opinion - but you'll have to brave the service.",

Okay so to find this place was a chore too, but basically you climb up the stairs on the right corner of the Paris Casino.There you can pick to sit at the couches or the tables. Obviously being comfort over food we chose couches for a large group.   Location was pretty cool being near the Bellagio and under Paris, I'll give them that. The cool air blowing in the outdoors was nice as well. The aesthetics were pleasing with the grass and woody feel to much of the tables, so I enjoyed that part.  However when it came to order beers they were \"out.\" Never had I thought a beer place would not have pretty much anything I selected on their menu. IPAs of all things too. So disappointing. I had to just go with some wine since no one drinks that anyways. I didn't want canned beer when they can pour out of tap. This was just embarrassing on Beer Garden's part. I get it if one beer is out, but not 3 different IPAs. That is unacceptable for a beer place to be out of so many.   Other than that, the party was good with friends and we made the most of out canned beers and wines.",

    "text": "Cane here to watch the euro finals game France vs Portugal. It's a beautiful place with picnic style benches, regular tables, 2 bars and couch area.   We were given water by the busboy and also menus. We were told at the bar we were sitting at that it wasn't open and we weren't going to be serviced over here that we had to go to the main one that was open to please a order. Hubs went to order a drink for me and walked up to the bar and was ignored by the Asian bartender. So he went to ask for some help at one of the cocktail waitress and was told by her she was too busy for him. One when we walked into their kitchen and asked who was in charge, and when he answered hubs said there should be someone to serve people at the no service bar. We have money that we wanted to spend while being here to watch the game.  IMHO final euro soccer game you should have more people on staff, it will get full, they're a bar what did you expected especially being in Las Vegas. And the people who are servers shouldn't have such a attitude when you're in the customer service industry, try being a little more polite just saying.   We sat there for the whole game ordered food and ordered drinks throughout, the bartender that we had made up for the fact that his fellow coworkers didn't have the same attitude as he did.   Overall the place is very clean spacious, right on the strip, great for sports events, has lounging areas,  lots of TVs, 2 large bars and even giant games like connect 4 and jenga blocks.",

You have the fun feeling of people gathering, drinking, great food,and fun games. It's an open restaurant, bar with misters and fans going to keep you cool. We normally sit at the ledge area over looking the strip and fountain. People watching is the best. Some of the things you see on the strip is crazy. If it gets to hot, just move toward the bar area, there's communal seating with fans and mister going to cool you off. They have the classic games, jumbo jenga, connect four.   But let's get to the point, they have tater tots. I mean come on, how can you go wrong with tater tots. The food menu is great, not a fancy foo foo menu. Straight to the point of burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches. Bings that go great with beer on a hot summer afternoon. Also, the music selection is great. Must stop off for a beer or cocktails whenever anyone's in town. Have a seat at the edge, people watch and enjoy the fountain show whenever it's on.",

I called my colleague as we were both staying at the Paris where was he at and I met him at this place. Once you arrive you climb the stairs up to the rooftop setting. There is tables and benches as well as big ass umbrellas which believe me we used to block out the glaring sun and so I wouldn't burn.   Now why a 3.5 star in the land of the over the top restaurants menu was limiting to healthy choices. So I got water and we split the ginormous portions of burger and garlic fries. The burger is served on a small metal tray pretty cool. It was good but being a Beer Park I am sure most guests come for there wide selection of beers. We came for the understated lunch and to sit outside.   The stairs I could imagine would be a challenge if you had one too many beers but that's Vegas lots of walking and ways to work in a workout.",

Came here on Saturday afternoon to watch the World Series, it was packed but we waited at the bar for stools (if your party is small, I recommend just waiting in the bar area until someone leaves, that way you don't have to wait for a table).  Reasonably priced beers, my 2 friends and I got a pitcher of Kona Brewing's Big Wave (definitely one of my fave beers haha so tasty).   Lots of TVs to watch the game on, really chill vibes, pretty good service at the bar (might take a while to get their attention because it's pretty crowded, but not bad). Wide selection of beers for sure, everyone will find something they love.  Quick walk down the strip to get to it, if you're staying at planet hollywood or any of those hotels.  Cutesy outdoor vibes, really great during summer evenings! Will be back for sure.",

This place also have tons of tvs that plays various sports games and I was able to see my golden state warriors epic win against okc tonight!    I wasn't sure how much beers were because I didn't order but I think it's around 6 to 10 bucks each. We also ordered by pitchers. This is a great place to just sit relax, enjoy the fresh air and the warm night while laughing and enjoying good times with friends.

My friend and I split the loaded tater tots, which were borderline life-changing and the barbecue chicken cobb salad, which was also tasty! Splitting an appetizer and the salad was more than enough food for the two of us. I took a look at the beer list and was pretty impressed, as they had at least fifteen different beers on tap, plus I think that they had a bottled beer list as well.   Seating is really nice, with a view of the Bellagio across the street with tables in the shade or the sun. It was a beautiful day, so we decided on sitting in the sun and it was great. Our service was great too! I'd come back for sure.",

Great sports bar with several large TV's, we played shuffleboard, large Junga, they will set up beer pong for you too!  Great place to hang out, and that's what we did with friends. Hostesses were friendly and greeted us and sat us where we wanted to be - in the shade and by the big fan. Beer selection is meh, ~two dozen on tap another dozen bottles - only One local beer on tap, rest were Budweiser's portfolio from Kona, Goose Island, Blue moon (I guess is Coors), bunch of interesting ales, heffs, stout (Guinness- ) only one other vanilla stout.  $14 for a flight of four 6 oz, pitchers are $27. Ok beer selection, need more local or crafts on tap. Typical bar food, we had the pretzel-yummy hot with a delicious cheese sauce. 7 layer dip, meh ok, chili lime dusted chips were good dipped in that cheese sauce. They had a smoker going next to us, so their smoked chicken legs and ribs must be good. Saw plates of burgers, salads and other sandwiches - that looked good. Our server was very attentive friendly and was always checking up on us filling up our ice waters- great job!",

    "text": "This place is great! I have been looking forward to it opening for a while now since the concept seemed so cool, but you never know with the strip ventures if it's actually going to live up to the hype. Luckily, this place does :-)  We were there Saturday night, a very cold Saturday night and it was still pretty busy, but you can tell as soon as it warms up it will be slammed. There are a ton of neat things to do (people size Jenga, Corn Hole, Pool, and several other games I can't remember now, lol) and the view is fabulous! There are a ton of TV's playing every sport you can think of and a wide range of seating options (bars, tables, group tables, comfy couches)   Let's get to the good stuff, the food! At the moment, they are not doing the full menu but a small sampler of what they will have. I am very excited for the full menu though, as many of their offerings have some kind of beer ingredient involved which sounds very cool. Another thing I have been excited about are the prices. Everything is very reasonably priced, especially for the strip! Love that they are not going crazy on the pricing, it means we can eat more, lol!  On Saturday we had the Chile Verde Nachos, and Hummus. The Nachos were fabulous!! The chips taste homemade, the cheese sauce (made with beer) is great, and the pork was sooooo good, and I am not usually even a pork fan. It was one of those meals you keep eating after you are full just because it is so yummy! The hummus was great too and the pita chips that came with it were yummy and there was a TON of them! My husband and I shared and couldn't even finish all the food, great portion sizes!  I should mention too that the cups and dishes look like red solo cups, or plastic cups, and paper plates but are actually a sturdy hard plastic and it is just kind of neat. Gives you that outdoor bbque or tailgate feel, but is actually a sturdy option. They even have tiny red solo shot glasses!   I'll end this with saying they also have a TON of beer (duh, beer park) I actually had margaritas (YUM!) but will have to try some of the bazillion beers they have another time. I saw them giving little tasters of beer out, which I thought was very cool, so you can make sure you like it before you get a huge one. All in all a very cool new place that I think is a great addition to the strip. I can't wait to watch some games there! :-)",

I expected better service for the hefty $150 plus fee that we each paid to sit. Fights broke out and the security was no where in sight. The security was more preoccupied with checking wristbands making sure that people who paid for standing room weren't sitting. Most of the chairs were empty anyway! It was by far the biggest waist of money while in Las Vegas.",

Beer Park is located in front of the Paris hotel/casino and is right on the strip, so you will get a nice strip view should you sit at a table instead of at the bar. You can park for free at the Caesar's parking lots nearby if you are a Las Vegas local. If not, parking will be paid anywhere in the vicinity.  We had a few beers and some food. Everything tasted good, but the very high prices were quite disappointing. Expect to pay at least $10 for most beers, and over $20 if you go for one of their entrees. They do offer a very large selection of beers though. Food selection will be much smaller though.  The atmosphere here is pretty nice even though it will get quite crowded on weekends during the summer. Please note that you will sit outside so cover up between November and March since the heaters will not be enough to keep you warm.  In conclusion, I would say that this is a good place to get a beer if you don't mind paying a lot of money for it. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",

We went in on a Saturday afternoon, no reservation. It's right across from the Bellagio and you can see the fountains if you're sitting right up on the edge. There were no tables left but some had a 'reserved' sign on them--I asked a waitress and she said they had to be open starting at 5PM. We would have plenty of time so we ended up sitting there, otherwise we would have been waiting a while for a table.  My husband and I both ordered cheeseburgers, fries, and a draft beer. It's a great place to sit for a while, especially on a nice day. If there's a sporting event that's even better, as they have TVs and speakers lining the walls. I would go back if I ever find myself there again.",

Beer Park is centrally located (directly across from the Bellagio Fountains) with a stellar view and plenty of games to choose from if you're not indulging in the insane selection of beers and tasty bar bites.   Anytime I have beer enthusiasts inquiring about where to go on the strip, I have usually directed them to Yard House but Beer Park has been my new go-to. Located in front of Paris hotel, Beer Park is a few quick hops up some stairs to a great Sunday Funday location. You can check in with the hostesses to get games (they have Shuffle Board, (used to have) Pool (maybe it'll be back in the warmer months?), Jenga and connect four, just to name a few. You can enjoy an insane selection of beer (I reccomend the Apolocolypse line) and some bar bites while playing the games or watching whatever sports are on - this place has plenty of TVs on location.  I will say that the food we had was not bad, but it wasn't the best bar food. I had ordered the chicken drums thinking they'd be smaller wing sized but they were three \"medium\" sized chicken drums. They were alright...something was weird about the taste that I didn't finish them... but then again, I had been drinking all day so it really could have just been me.   Beer Park is definitely worth a visit if you're on the Las Vegas Strip in search of something fun and casual to do. :)  *2017 Yelp Review Challenge: 2/100*",

    "text": "Las Vegas usually conjures up thoughts of partying poolside by day and clubbing late into the night, and while I love to travel, neither of the aforementioned activities are really things I'm interested in. So, the fact that this lovely outdoor beer garden overlooking the Strip and facing the gorgeous Bellagio fountains was right outside our hotel, I was thrilled.   AMBIENCE: This trip was meant to celebrate my sister's 21st birthday, and she's a lot like me: she's not very much into clubbing, but loves to drink and sight-see. After a long day of walking around and swimming in the Nevada heat, we came here on a Tuesday night around 9 pm. There were a lot of people, but we easily found a spot exactly where we hoped we would, facing the Bellagio fountains. It was dark and... maybe the beer helped... but one of the most gorgeous views I've ever had while drinking.   STAFF: Our waitress was very relaxed and answered whatever questions we had about our beer, because again, it was my sister's first few days being able to drink legally, so she had a few questions!   PRICES: The beer was a little more expensive than I would've liked, but it's on par with what I expected when it came to buying alcohol in Las Vegas. Probably $7-8 for a Blue Moon, but it was vacation, so I'm not furious. Makes sense!  Overall, if you want a casual spot to drink a beer while overlooking one of the most famous streets in the country, Beer Park is a low-key, enjoyable spot for just that.",

With the open air, it's a great place to sit at night, even on chilly nights since they have heaters above the tables. It's also a good place to catch sports with lots of tvs sprinkled throughout the space. The beer menu is pretty extensive with a ton of craft beer offerings both on tap and in bottles. The food is even pretty solid for bar food. Sometimes it's nice to get outside of the casinos.",

You gain access to the location by taking the large outdoor steps from the street on the strip. You cannot gain access through the casino.  The summer heat may be unbearable during the day but the Beer Park is lovely at night. They do have plenty of fans and misters to cool you off. The Park offers amazing views of the strip including the Bellagio Fountains.  The menu is typical bar type food. We had the popcorn chicken, soft pretzel, and fried macaroni. They were all very good.  The drink menu is mostly beer but they do offer other selections. I did a four beer flight.  If you are looking to view any type of sporting event this is the place to do it. There are plenty of televisions to view.",

Met a bartender named Austin with a tat of 3 lines on his arm and the dude was totally cool. He's moved from out of town and we asked him if he has visited our home state of California and not yet. I would totally party with this dude. He's cool as hell and if you ever have a chance to meet him hook him up at the bar. I know A LOT of bartenders and this dude is legit. Have fun at this sweet bar. See you there! Cheers!",

There's a good number of tables to choose from, a few bars to sit at, or a line of bar stools facing the strip to allow for some good people watching. The misters and cool breeze that came from the covered portion of the deck bar was a nice relief from the Vegas heat.  We only tried the popcorn chicken appetizer which was a good portion to price (compared to other items on the menu) but overall I'd say the prices are a notch above what you'd find at other places on the strip. They have a good selection of craft draft beers to pick from, expect to pay $9 and up for a 22oz, or $36+ for a pitcher.   The service we had was great. We sat at a table since we had our kids with us and the waitress was pretty attentive and friendly. They have a number of things to keep you or your kids occupied while you enjoy your drinks, like large or table-size Jenga games, huge connect four games, or several table shuffle boards. Overall, a nice place to grab a drink on the strip if you're not on a budget.",

I was pleasantly surprised to see that Beer Park also has an awesome view, and a nice open, clean large space to hang and enjoy.  Finding the entrance was a little confusing, so just ask somebody.   The beer selection was pretty good, catered a bit to the masses, but I was able to find a few yummy ones.  I went for the $15 flight because it seemed like a good way to get my monies worth.  Was really nice to enjoy on a 101 degree evening while taking in the strip from above.  Also, the music was awesome, they were playing some really good mixes, and the atmosphere was just somewhere you want to be.",

It seems, that they have a rule that The team who's fans have the most reservations get to hear the sound on their particular game. It seemed to me and my group that there were substantially less fans for the sound of the game we heard. There were far more Patriots fans in the bar but they refused to turn on sound for us.  We were the loudest cheering fans there and heard hardly anything for the game they were playing the sound for which is very upsetting. The food was good the service was just OK.

The beer options are endless and it is a great venue to watch sporting events (NCAA basketball tournament was on). I would recommend the loaded tater tots. I tried the mac and cheese egg rolls and would say they are unique but kind of a weird pairing and aren't very filling. Otherwise they do have a variety of food options so you don't have to settle on your typical ball park hot dog. The design and atmosphere are well thought out, the only complaint is that majority of the seats are in the direct sun, and we visited in March and was hot after an hour, I can only imagine this spot in the summer ( maybe build some shade structures/fans).

The bread was entirely too thick, it wasn't toasted or soft, it was a bit much. The fries tasted like frozen ore ida fries- and they charge $4.95 for a side of fries - they're not included wit the burger.

Went with a group for moms bday and had a great table with an amazing view. The service and food were definitely still in the trial and error phase, food all came out separately and some items were wrong. Buckets of beer were expensive, but hey it's Vegas so there is nothing you can do about that. Our waitress was a bit stressed and when I asked her how she was doing, she said she was struggling and was getting no help from management. Overall there are just minor fixes that would make this place great! Will have to give another chance when I return to Vegas.",

The tables are park benches and each sit about 12 guests (Im assuming.) there is also bar seating and stools around the perimeter of the place where you can get the best view. There are also couches to lounge around on. the beer selection is great, didn't ask if they had double IPAs but I'm sure they do.

They also have large cooling fans to keep us comfortable.   The macaroni egg rolls, hot wings, nachos, and skewers were all delicious.

I cannot speak for a 'normal' day, but for football it is perfect.  The breakfast menu (1 p.m. ET games are at 10 a.m. PT, big adjustment for me) is pretty limited, but I really liked the Sausage and Egg on a Muffin sandwich.  The brisket and eggs was okay, potatoes/pepper/egg was good but brisket cuts were a little fatty and overcooked.  Fairly reasonable prices on drinks here, as you can imagine by the name the beer selection is very comprehensive (other than the fact Bud has a stranglehold on the domestic, so no Coors Light or Miller Lite here).  Staff was great, friendly waitress and a roaming 'water' guy always makes sure you are hydrated (great touch).  I had such a positive experience for Football that now I'd likely come back on at night to check out the scene.  Note: if you have a large crew or really need to watch your team, call ahead and reserve a table.",

Located at the Paris Hotel underneath the fake ifel tower, it's a good place to chill day or night and nice views of the bellagio fountain water show.   Good choice of craft beers, lots of Jenga games, pool tables, beer pong, lots of tv's for viewing sports, and table soccer games. You can sit at the end and look down onto the strip and people and car watch.  My only -1 star is because it's the strip. The price of beers are like mlb baseball prices. A 32oz glass will cost you from $13-15 bucks depending on what beer you order. The 16oz is cheaper pending on the   The food menu is decent. I only had the blue cheese burger and tator tots. Both were good but not great. I don't know how the other foods are but I was told by the bar tender that all the burgers were good and the tator tots.   I would definitely come back again. The best time to come during the hot summer days is at night from 7:30 pm on. The best times are Friday and Saturday night because they open till 2am. The rest of the days they close at 11pm.   So of you ever decide to come here, just know that be prepared to spend more than you should. As far as the service, the bar tender was very tentative every time I  walked up to him and ordered a beer and food.",

The slaw was regular with a single jalapeno slice on top.  The pork was dry and very little smoke flavor.  They put their BBQ sauce on it instead of on the side and it was not very good and definitely did not compliment the pork.  I also got a side of Buffalo onion rings.  Sounds like it could be delish but it failed badly.  Instead of blue cheese crumbles and buffalo sauce drizzle on them served with ranch or blue cheese on the side, they had some kind of crappy blue cheese dust on them served with a side of not very good hot sauce.

I asked the server what it was and she said it was a fee \"we charge our customers to come in and eat & drink here\".  This fee is not mentioned on any signage that I saw nor did I see it on the menu. Just a random fee they apparently add on without warning. Ours was $3.05.

Love the vibe of this restaurant, its like outdoors, but also indoors, plays music, extra large games you can play while waiting for the food...very cool.  On to the service, I was confused, we had two different girls come to the table at different times so it was confusing which was actually our server.  The one we deemed as our official server was very mediocre with us in her service.  Anyways on to the food.  Chili Verde nachos: Saw all the mouthwatering pictures posted and all the amazing reviews.  I was fooled, I did not care for them.  My first bite, something was off, it just had this weird taste that I'm not used to nachos tasting like. So I'm like okay, maybe I got a bad taste, I'll go back for another, nope still the same off taste.  Then I realized it tasted like a hint a beer, which was causing the off taste, as I do not enjoy the taste of beer.  My boyfriend drinks beers here and there and he also didn't like these nachos. The cheese was very mute in flavor, didn't have the typical queso flavor, no tomatoes, lettuce, guac, sour cream.  Even the pork was weird, I think they should offer chicken or beef as an alternative.  Bleu Cheese Burger: This is what my bf got and it was pretty tasty, however the fries were an extra cost and way too much salt.",

Food options are limited and also overpriced even by Strip standards. Quality is not even close to being on par with the pricing. Last, but definitely not least, they hit you with a very sneaky deceptive 4.7% fee on every check. It's called a concession fee. A few other unscrupulous restaurants are doing this, like their sister property Hexx. You get absolutely nothing for this added, hidden fee. Yes it is on the menu, in tiny little print in the bottom corner located after a warning about meat products. Shame on you Beer Garden. Your great view isn't enough to get this person back.",

The misters were on, but i was suffering a little.  The food tastes AMAZING! My only complaints are drink prices,  slow service and the fact that a football day was a blackout date for my groupon :( With it being a sports bar,  you would think that the groupon wouldn't be so limited,  not fair.  So,  i am out $26 because of that as im not going back to vegas before the expiration date!",

But, like a few other places, they have decided to trick their customers by attaching a 4.7% 'fee' to the bill without clearly indicating it anywhere. Clearly they don't trust that they're product is good enough to charge what they should, so they add this fee at the end, when most people won't even see it. It's an awful practice, and one that shows great disdain for the public. If you want to charge $18 for a drink, I'm fine with that, people can make their own decisions about value.

It's such a good spot - great food, a huge beer and drinks selection, and it's cute and lets you be outdoors in the nice weather.   Yesterday my fiance and I came with my sister and her boyfriend for our second annual Vegas football trip, and other than spending way too much money here (mimosas are $12 a glass whaaat) it was a super fun day again lol. We all loved our food and our waitress was super sweet! She was really attentive no matter how busy things got, which was really awesome.

    "text": "The one star here is solely because of the ambiance of Beer Park. If it wasn't a cute and fun spot, I'd give it negative stars.   When my party of 13 young black women arrived at Beer Park it was like leaving Vegas and entering rural Alabama where black people are seen as often as palm trees, aka never! We were stared at as we walked through the restaurant and found space big enough for us all towards the back. We got settled and about 10 of us went to the bar to order. After sitting at the bar unacknowledged for at least 5 minutes, a white woman walked up to the bar and was promptly greeted by the bartender who had been ignoring us.   Now, as a bartender myself, I understand that it's better to take one small order before taking care of a large party. The problem was that 1) we all could've ordered before that woman even got to the bar 2) the bartender was VERY rude when we asked to order because we were there first.  Any other day, I would've left this bar immediately. However, being that we were all starving and had found a place large enough for our group we stuck it out and mostly ordered from a different bartender.   I ordered the grilled chicken btla which was a big disappointment. The chicken was rubbery and bland and it took about 20 minutes for me to get it. I was one of the first to order and several burgers and other items came before I got my sandwich. Other members of my party waited almost an hour before they received their food.   Overall, Beer Park is pretty trash. They're in a good spot with a great view but I'll never eat there again.",

    "text": "One of my new favorite spots in Vegas! Get reservations because I never saw this place with many open tables. We had a fantastic table for two with panaramic, unobstructed views of the Bellagio side of the strip. The vibe here is just cool, laid back, and party. My husband and I loved how the water came in glasses modeled after the solo cup and the tail gate look of the restaurant. They even had a variety of board/card games at various tables to play with!  The food and drinks are killer! We shared the mac and cheese eggrolls which were the perfect fun appetizer to share, and definitely utilize the dipping sauces it comes with! I got the BBQ Chicken Cobb salad and my husband got one of their burgers. The salad was huge and beautiful! I gave it an honest try but still had a lot leftover because there was just so much to it! We loved our drinks and would've ordered more if we weren't planning on having drinks at a different spot after lunch. My only issue was service was a little slow but we didn't so much mind because it was nice to sit back and admire the views.",

She seemed irritated. Fast forward to getting my food. No drink. I said where is my drink? She rolled her eyes and had a dumb blank stare... Ice tea I reminded her. She went back to search for it I guess. 3 min later she emerges after having to stop and talk to a coworker first...because that's more important. I get the bill and this literally took 7 MIN to run my card. First I said bill to my room, she comes back 5 min later... I can't do that. Really? At this point Im beyond irritated. Hand her my card and it takes her a few minutes to run this... Apparently not the sharpest tool in the shed. I left a nice note and told her to show her manager. Last time I'll be at this place when I'm here for a conference. Doesnt seem they can find decent/competent people to work. Oh and yes.. They dress like hooters.. Some should not be wearing shorts so tight that you see butt cheeks hanging out. That in itself makes you loose your appetite.",

    "text": "Last weekend, my sister and her fiance, my boyfriend, and I came to Vegas for our second annual Vegas football trip lol. Both years we have gone to Beer Park to watch and bet on our games, and it's always a great time!! It's a great spot on the roof overlooking The Strip, and they have tons of TVs and seating for all of us to find our game. You'll definitely want to get there early to find a good spot, because it gets crowded on Sundays.   They have great mimosas and Bloody Mary's for the morning games, and a huge selection of beer to choose from during the day. We even had some seltzers, as those are available on their menu, too. My boyfriend had the Popcorn Chicken, and it was amazing. He did get the buffalo and bleu cheese on the side and just ate it plain - he was a little hungover and still getting going ;) but the chicken by itself was great! I had the Grilled Chicken B.L.T.A. and it was sooo good. The chicken was nice and juicy, with a really yummy bun and chipotle mayo. I would definitely recommend it. It's a really good brunch option for when it's actually getting closer to lunchtime.  My sister and her fiance both got the Breakfast Burger, which they went on and on about for days lol. It did look amazing and I'll probably try that if they still have it next time we're in town! Also, our waitress (wish I remembered her name) was awesome. Super nice and fun, and did a really great job. Love this place!",

    "text": "Had so much fun here that we came back three times during our short stay in Vegas!  Beer Park is a rooftop bar overlooking the Las Vegas strip. Totally the right place to watch a football game as they have multiple high-definition TV's. Tons of picnic tables to sit at along with games you can play such as jenga, connect four, and they even have baggo. With an extensive beer list you shouldn't have any problem finding something you like! They even have a beer cocktail list.   We came here last Sunday to watch the Eagles game. Because it was such a huge day for football they were only showing it on one tiny TV in the corner of the bar. Kind of stunk, but what can you do. Every bartender we interacted with was so nice and fast at their job. They card everyone. If you get a drink from one bartender they will card you and if you get a drink from their partner they will probably card you too.   The food here looks amazing. I was drooling over the nachos, but never got a chance to try them! - I recommend trying to get a seat that over looks the strip. So nice and relaxing and it's the perfect amount of breeze on a warm night. During the day they have awnings and mists to keep the crowd cool.   During the weekends they open up @9AM!",

Anheuser-Busch owns this loft style open air bar, with cooling fans, large screen TVs, and an assortment of Anheuser-Busch products.  The ambiance is great for someone wanting to see the Vegas sights and sounds outdoors and enjoy a brew at the same time.  The only negative thing I would say about this place is the price. A few beers will set you back the same as a normal dinner out in many cities. Three large drafts and tip will set you back about $40, but you're in Vegas and if you won big at the Bellagio or Caesars Palace come here for a nightcap!",

Beers were really expensive (as to be expected on the strip, but still...) and for being called \"Beer Park\" they really didn't have a plethora of options (many options from the same brands, mostly national brands). I've been many places that feature more beers then this location.   There were some \"lawn games\" that you could play on the deck including a giant Connect 4. They also had some nice seating areas on the deck area.   The bartender we ordered from wasn't warm and fuzzy, but she got the job done and was able to serve us our drinks. I didn't see anyone receiving table service and was never offered a food menu so I'm not sure what the options are.   I'd stop by here again to check out the Bellagio fountains and maybe enjoy 1 drink, but then I'd head out somewhere else to explore.",

I was prepared for high prices, but not this freaking high! I don't mind paying a pretty penny for a good quality beer. $15 for a pint of beer is a bit steep. I do however object to paying a significant premium for Budweiser's portfolio of \"craft  beer\". Heck, even Bud Light was $10 or something!   Being the sucker that I am, I ended up with a Founders Session IPA for $13.50 or something. I wasn't even close to drunk yet so that stung a bit more than the Vegas sun that was beating down my neck while sitting at the rooftop bar.    The rooftop bar with a killer view of the strip is a great idea. In fact it's the whole point of going here. It wasn't even all that hot on the day we were there and I couldn't imagine sitting out in the sun uncovered for much longer. If it weren't for all the beer splashing me from the frat dorks playing beer pong behind me, I would've overheated out there.   The service wasn't all that great to make me wanna come back either. I felt ignored for the majority of the time that we sat at the bar. That's okay because I ignored the line on the receipt where it says tip...  No thanks to any Budweiser swill. I'll stick to Sin City Brewing for all my beer needs until real craft beer eventually hits the strip. Or better yet, hitch a ride to downtown where there's a few decent breweries popping up lately.",

I now get why they call it Beer Park.\"  Just like your local community park, Beer Park is a completely outdoor venue with a playground of grown-up activities.  Big Jenga, big Connect-Four, bean bag toss, and pool tables are available to keep you busy while you take down your brew of choice, and they've got a huge selection of the draft and bottled variety.  While you can't grill your own BBQ as you would at the park down the street, Beer Park's got a pretty good food menu.  For me, I didn't dive into the entrees, but I can attest that the Chile Verde Nachos hit the spot.  For this location, Beer Park has probably one of the best spots on the strip; great spot to watch the Bellagio fountains.",

Beers here are all owned by ABINBEV, so though there are a few craft beers available they fall under the ABINBEV Umbrella. And you pay a ridiculous price for said beers, and then on top of that a Vendor Fee is added as well. WTF? If you want to be viewed as a Hipster, and money is no object, then by all means feel free to stop in, But if you want to drink quality beer at much more reasonable prices, there are far better options in Vegas!",

Even for a low level beer it will run you $9. The food is typical bar food and will also break your bank. They do have great TV selection and a shuffleboard table which is nice. Couple that with a great view and plenty of seats and I could see why you'd come here. But unless you just need to have that beer with a view, I think there are better options on the strip.",

We asked if we could go to a shadier table and had to wait because I think she may have needed to ask permission even though there were tons of empty tables. We really just didn't want to roast in the sun. I didn't really look at the menu before going in because we were hungry. There weren't too many healthy options on the menu and the portions were huge (which is usually a good thing). It was a cool area though with games on the tables and a good selection of beer. Pricing was okay to kind of pricey, but what can you expect when you are over looking the strip. Our waters weren't filled and when you order drinks, you want to stay hydrated. We weren't checked on as much I'd like (to ask for water, had to ask someone random working there). Maybe our waitress may not have liked that we wanted to switch tables? Service was not the best. Overall our food was decent, service was meh, and the best part may have been the games...",

They have TONS of big screens tuned to all the relevant games and lots of delicious beers on draft and bottled to choose from.  Food is overpriced and not anything special. I shared the carne Adana plate ($22) with my uncle and it was tough and lackluster. My parents said the salads were decent but it's $15-$20 bucks. Definitely skip it.  Another positive: they have a ton of games you can play for free (they hold your ID  while you're using it). They have a jumbo connect four you can play on your table, and my dad and I played shuffleboard while we waited for our food.  My advice? Skip the food. Come here for a beer (or 3) and to catch part of your game.  WARNING: they have misters but if you are in the sun/here not in the winter months or at night it will be HOT and miserable.",

Everything I've tried off their menu has been fantastic and the portions are filling. My favorites are the hummus platter, Ceasar's Salad and their homemade pickles. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is I feel their beer prices are a bit high, even for Vegas. My brother spent $15 for a Stella, my bf spent $14 for an IPA. I always get a bud if I come here, but only because that's the only $6 drink you can get. Because of that, I recommend coming for the food and atmosphere and getting a majority of your drinks elsewhere. Overall though, it's an amazing place to hang out!",

You can see the fountains across the way and it's a prime view for people watching. They have booths and a couch area which look so comfy. We came on Friday the 30th at 7:00pm. So the reason for 3 stars is that the service here was insane. When you are in Las Vegas you think of fast friendly service and this place didn't cut it. Granted when things are busy you know it's going to be a while. I just didn't expect it to go down like this! We put our names down with the host for a booth/couch area. We decided to wait at the ledge overlooking the Strip. There were stools placed along the ledge. We sat for about 15 minutes and never had any body greet or talk to us. We decided to go to the bar and get drinks and return. We get to the bar and order a flight she immediately started making it before we could finish the rest of our order. We wanted a total of three flights and the bartender told us they were out of flights and had to wait until they washed more. Well at this point I'm already tired of waiting so we ordered cocktails instead. Then we went back to our area. Finally after 45 minutes of being there a server came and asked us if we wanted drinks. I said no we have someone getting us some can i just get a pretzel. The pretzel was a 10. Super hot and the cheese was yummy. It took a while to get that but I guess they were really busy. We wanted to order more food but our server never came back. After I got my pretzel another male server brought us waters, an hour into us being there. At this point we gave up on getting the couches and decided to go downstairs to the bar inside of the Paris. This place has so much potential but the service was the worst i have had in Las Vegas recently. I hate to say it because i love the concept! Maybe come when it's slow...",

I had to change my reservation a few times and there was no problem with this and my table was still ready when I arrived.  The place has a fun atmosphere, there were people watching the football game while others were enjoying playing the games at their tables such as Jenga and Connect Four.  Menu had the usual sports bar selection of food. My BBQ Chicken Cobb Salad was a good size and tasted good. Was disappointed to hear they had run out of all their cocktails on draft when I went to order one. Also when we received the bill I discovered that they have a CNF charge that is known as the \"Concession and Franchise Fee.\" That was an extra charge on our bill we weren't aware was going to be there. I think it's on really small print on their menu! I've only ever had a similar thing at Niagara Falls but after looking it up turns out a few restaurants in Vegas are starting it too!   The place is fun and food/location was good but shame about the extra fees!",

I lived in vegas for 12 years and although I love the roof of the rio and the palms for those warm summer nights and the view but this place has the BEST 360 degree view of the HEART of the strip! Front row for dancing waters at the Bellagio!? Are you kidding me? Don't miss this spot on your next trip to Vegas, baby!! Seriously made my night - thanks Beer Park!!",

It's comfortable, lots of tv's, good looking food (although i didnt get the chance to try any of that), and most importantly a roof top bar on the strip that views the Belagio fountain.  Beer menu needs LOTS of work. It is disappointing seeing the larger number of beers with a crap selection. Seriously what's the point of a beer bar with this many taps when your selection is going to be budweiser, bud light, shock top, stella, sierra nevada, corona, goose island, heinken, and just about every other beer that EVERY BAR HAS. This to me defeats the whole point of having so many taps. This place could be like yardhouse with way better atmosphere and possibly better food(which i plan to come back to try).  Please please please get a better beer list. I love beer, especially craft beer, but i ended up ordering vodka sodas because the selection just didnt grab my attention. Get some sour beers, some good IPA's, some better belgians (they did have delerium, props for that at least, probably the only decent beer they had).",

I confirmed 3 times before Saturday to make sure we were good to go. I was told each time Yes. Then Friday night during my wedding I get a nasty phone call telling me that they changed all of reservations to the lounge and one big party and told me to \"deal with it\". I told them I am in the middle of my wedding and I will talk to you tomorrow. I showed up 10 min prior to our reservation and the female manager said sorry and bought my first round which was one beer. Then they told us that even though we had separate reservations. That they were now a group and charged an automatic gratuity, which is not right. Then they would not separate any of the checks, told us at the end of lunch that we had to split 30 people 3 ways, and for us to figure it out. She told me there was no way to split on a POS system. I told her I was an F&B manager in the past and it could be done. then she changed her story again. I would not trust anything they say, they change their minds, its all about the money and not customer service. I will not be going back to this place ever again.",

Essentially, the \"Concession and Franchise Fee\" is like a resort fee, but you get nothing in return. This fee has \"deceptive business practice\" written all over it. The fee is listed on the menu in tiny print that is hard to see and read. The solution to the growing problem of CNF charge in Vegas is easy: Don't go to these places. Run, don't walk, to establishments that appreciate you and your patronage. I understand that it can be expensive to operate a business, but the food and drinks are already over priced. There is no need for this fee.",

The staff is awesome and very helpful for starters, as the moment we went up the stairs the hostess was more than happy to help. And yes the stairs! This restaurant is located on the roof top of hexx which brings me to the other plus side and a very big plus side ! the views that this place has, you would usually have to pay a very hefty price, but at 10 for a burger 22 for some of the juiciest and just amazing tri tip you'll have this place is truly bang for your buck ! The view is absolutely stunning! Right in front of the bellagio water fountains in the heart of everything that is Las Vegas beer park sits among some of the best piece of real estate the city ha to offer. Reminiscent of a picnic in the park or your block party, the atmosphere is absolutely fun and energetic ! You'll have a blast just being here in the center of everything. Beer park has something that almost no restaurant can offer here in Las Vegas , awesome food, awesome views, amazing atmosphere and everything for a pretty damn good price !

Just a dab will do it. Takes it to the next level. Falafel was best ever-and I've had a lot of falafel. Great kick! Tuna sandwich had a flavor profile that wowed my husband to the point of pure joy. He had the urge to hunt down the manager and shake his hand. That has never happened!  And let's not forget our great bartender, Adam. Great guy-very helpful-cool-down to earth personality.

There wasn't many True local craft beers but lots of representation from the larger breweries across the US and the world. The view is great as is the location.   Wouldn't plan a dinner there or recommend to diehard craft beer people but a fun little spot.",

She had a little earring in her mouth and really did a great job of servicing us considering we were just having lunch and not getting drinks. The pretzel app was very good but that is about it as far as good food is involved. I had a chicken sandwich with bacon that was cooked several hours ago, and a bun that was very clearly dried out. The flavor was ok at best. My girlfriend had a turkey wrap with a couple of very weird fatty bacon pieces. It was strange to have such different bacon over the 2 dishes. Probably good for drinks but wouldn't recommend it as a serious dining option.",

For such a nice location outside with the strip view, this place was just awful. At least our server was cool. But the food! Geezuz, where do I start???? Ok so the chicken BLTA was on a very dry bun and the chicken was dry and overcooked. Those pork and green choke nachos!!!! OMG, horrible! I was so excited. The pork was ice cold and where were these green chiles??? There was sliced sweet red peppers everywhere. The onion rings were the best part. So I wanted to start with appetizers then order dinner. That was not going to happen here! We paid $100 for that nastiness! We felt bad for the waitress wasn't her fault we had COLD, disgusting food. $44 for 4 Jameson and gingerales....wow. We ended up have dinner inside at the dim sum place. We knew we should've just went there in the first place! Ugh!!!!",

Though I enjoy the outdoor set up that also offers plenty of shade and a great view, the prices are high and they have a high staff turnover rate. When I have been hosted there for work my experience is really good since we're getting special attention but when I've gone for social purposes the bartenders are not personable, they don't offer recommendations they just want to pick what you want so they can be done. I also don't love their selection of beer, you're limited to only Budweiser products and it's very expensive. For two large lagers I paid $30. Their hours of operations are very inconsistent as well. We looked up the hours before a group of us met there to stay till last call but that evening the bartender said they're going to close at 11pm because it wasn't as busy as normal. There was about 20 people there so that was a disappointment.",

I should have known, in Vegas, that it would be sponsored by a huge corporate entity like Budweiser. I still gave it a try because I enjoy Goose Island and some of the other breweries Bud has purchased.   On the up side, the beer was reasonably priced (around $8 for a 16 oz) and our server was extremely sweet and attentive. Waters were always refilled on a hot LV afternoon, and she had a great sense of humor.   Sadly, the hot pretzel I had here was probably the worst one I've ever had. It tasted like deep-fried bland dough. Not flaky and salty like a pretzel should be. My friend ate the cheese it was served with and commented about the weird film the cheese had on top.   I love the idea of this place, but I'd only return if I couldn't find any other options with more beer. Having 20-30 beers on your menu isn't very impressive in an age where brewpubs have 100+ taps.",

We walked upstairs and immediately sat down at the bar and began trying to select a drink from the impressively stacked beer list.  I took the easy way out and did a flight of four beers, all of which were quite tasty and refreshing. In terms of the food, we went with the Chili-Cheese Fries (crinkle cut fries, chili con carne, Bass IPA cheese sauce). Then we waited.  We waited so long, in fact, that the bartender grabbed our check and made sure that she had put the order in. The food finally arrived about 20 minutes after we'd ordered it and was nowhere near hot. It had obviously been sitting there for at least five minutes before it had been brought to us, so the cheese had basically gone hard. (There were no oh-so-satisfying melty cheese strings here, that's for sure.)  It tasted good, at least, but we could only imagine how much better it would've been had it been served fresh.",

Restaurant sits outside of the Paris on the second floor. Misters and string lights. Bar centrally located and plenty of  picnic table style seating all around.   Service was good. Came on Friday afternoon when it was a million degrees out. Misters helped to cool us off and drinks refilled often. Shared macaroni n cheese eggrolls and Geez Louise. Heaven in my book. The rest of the menu didn't really catch my eye too much but others in my party had the BLTA and the shrimp po boy. Pretty good. Didn't think the food was outstanding but it's bar food and if anything, have the Mac n cheese eggrolls.   Definitely a fun place to come hang out and play.

    "text": "We ate lunch at Beer Park and came away quite impressed with this center strip restaurant. Perched right atop the Las Vegas Strip, this outdoor venue treats you to a great view in a fun & casual environment.   The menu is about what you would expect. Appetizers, burgers, sandwiches and a few entrees to choose from. On our visit, Karen decided to go with the Popcorn Chicken appetizer. Dipped in a spicy buffalo sauce, and served with blue cheese & ranch (Karen passed on the blue cheese), this appetizer is a healthy portion. Karen hardly made a dent but it was great to take home for lunch for the next day.  I went with the Kahuna Cowboy Burger minus the cheese. An average size burger, it is served on a Pretzel Bun and is topped with a tasty Jalapeno BBQ sauce. Like many places on the strip, the burgers are served a la carte. Instead of adding fries or onion rings, I decided to add the Bavarian pretzel on the appetizer menu. Perfect size!  The service was really good on our visit as our server was very helpful on a number of questions. You will also hear some of your favorite musical artists over the sound system which helps create a fun vibe. Lastly, I wouldn't go here specifically to watch a game because there's no game sound, but there are plenty of TV's around should you want to keep an eye on a game or score.   Overall, I would definitely recommend Beer Park. There is one negative that absolutely annoys me. On all checks, there is a \"CNF\" fee added to your bill. As far as I can tell, this is simply an added fee with no real reason for being added. It's a cheap move and sadly in line with many fees now associated with your visit to the strip. It's not much (ours was $1.73), but to me, it's still the principal. If you need to raise your prices...just raise your prices. Don't disguise it in a fee that nobody knows what it is. Just be warned ahead of time that it will be there.",

    "text": "Our favorite rooftop bar/outdoor beer garden in Vegas!  So happy we discovered Beer Park. It's totally right up our alley - great craft beer selection, great food, awesome view, dope music, and family friendly! Located right in front of the Paris Hotel, with an amazing view of the strip and the Bellagio Fountains. Our kiddo enjoyed the games provided and the Bruno Mars/JT playlist, he sure loves to dance! It was about 95 degrees out that evening but the misters, fans and ice cold beers made it feel very pleasant up there. Beers were on the pricey side but that's to be expected of the location. No complaints there. We ordered the Loaded Tots, although it could have been more \"loaded\". I had to ask for an extra side of beer cheese and bacon. That was probably the only negative of the night but the service, delicious cold brews and great vibes made up for it. We also ordered the crinkle cut fries for our tot and he was all about them. Good fries + lots of games = happy kid. Happy kid = HAPPY MOMMA AND DADDY! =)  When we arrived for our reservation, the hostess initially told us that children weren't allowed that night because there would be a DJ playing that evening and the cut-off time was 8pm. Any other time would have been fine. I totally understood, and kindly just said I had wished we were informed that when I made the reservation. Before walking away, the hostess tells me, \"You know what, hold on. Let me talk to my manager and see what we could do.\" A few moments later she returns and tells us the manager said it would be fine to bring in my tot, as long as we could be done by 11pm. Perfect! We were done around 10:30pm. I was so appreciative that she took the time to ask her manager, rather than just sending us away. Now that's great customer service. I can't remember her name...Kailani perhaps?.. but a big thank you to her. She was such a friendly hostess. The service for the rest of the evening was superb as well. We are definitely hitting up Beer Park every time we visit Las Vegas!   Conveniently located right below Beer Park was HEXX Chocolate & Confexxions. Uhm..YUM! Perfect spot to grab some dessert afterward (or before!). Our tot enjoyed running amuck in there. It was a perfect ending to a perfect family fun Friday night!",

    "text": "I give this place a zero based on customer service and the manager Stephanie. She was incredibly rude and obnoxious. I was a vip guest of caesar's casino at the linq. I was instructed by my casino host to charge everything we do to our room. I asked to make sure at beer park before we ordered. The waitress assured me that yes because its a Caesars property. As i came unprepared to do anything other than charge it to my room. However that i take responsibility for. But the rude comments about finances and money that she so vocally expressed over a $32 bill is unacceptable.  I did exactly what my vip host instructed me to do and she refused to honor that.  That lady needs to get her face and attitude fixed. To allow her to manage a restaurant with her customer service that terrible and to a vip guest of the the casino is not tolerable.",

    "text": "Beer Park must have been designed by one of those people who takes theme parties very, very seriously. It's like a giant picnic party, complete with fake grass underfoot, giant picnic tables for seating, ceramic red Solo cups and plates designed to look like paper. Giant Jenga and checkers games, pool and shuffleboard tables make it a fun time, and there's also a view of the Bellagio fountain show. Toss in 30+ HD TV screens, making it a great place to watch a game. It's like a backyard party on steroids, in the best way.  Menu features shareable apps (mostly fried stuff), burgers and sausages- the buffalo onion rings($8, huge portion) and garlic fries ($8, served with black pepper baconnaise) were both pretty solid, the guys liked their burgers ($11), and the Shock Top Sausage ($14) was surprisingly flavorful. In two hours, we went through a couple of pitchers, and those added up fast. The food was pretty well priced for a Strip location. Before we left, my friends were already talking about when they'd be back.  TIPS:  *You can only enter from LV Blvd, so from the Paris casino floor, exit by Hexx and the entrance around the corner.  *You get the shuffleboard pucks from the hostess, who will require your ID.  *If you're an old fart whose back starts hurting at halftime from the lack of lumbar support at the picnic table, ask if your server can move you to the area with Adirondack chairs and couches in the corner by the grill.",

    "text": "I would of gave this place 4-5 stars, but a bartenders ignorance totally disqualified the opportunity.  My boyfriend recently got his new California Driver License, and the format has changed. It looks completely different!   He approached this particular bartender for a drink, and when she seen his identification, she said, \"she could call the cops for presenting fraudulent identification.\" She was really serious!!! Instead of that bartender asking management if it was a legitimate, she automatically assumed it was fake, and made a very ignorant remark.   My boyfriend felt extremely discriminated , and told the bartender to call the cops so they could train her on government issued ID's. She felt really stupid after he told her that, and decided to call her manager. She said, \"she was just kidding\"! She was being serious, and was not joking! Even if she was joking that was not funny. No one feels like laughing after someone tells them they are going to call the police on them. Especially for getting a drink.(FYI...My boyfriend was sober,and was getting a drink for me.)  When the manager came over. He showed no sign of sympathy over the situation. He said they had the right to refuse to service to anyone. He didn't apologize or make any attempt.  We agreed with the manager  about refusing service when it's just. It was not our fault they were ignorant with California ID's updates. We  suggested his staff get better training. Especially on government issued identifications. They also need to keep updated with any current updates on government  issued ID's. A bartenders jobs is not that hard. ID someone, charge, and pour...  It's unfortunate that the lack of staff training is making this facility loose patrons. Ignorance does not make it okay for them to discriminate and act unkindly. Especially after we had spend more than $500 on food and drinks.",

It was a Saturday, so naturally, college sports were on! I'm a college sport fan, hey, I indulge in college sports from time to time. But JESUS, not on full blast- it was enough to give a headache. On top of that- IT WAS BLASTING DURING THE COMMERCIALS, \"DRINK DIET COKE, SHAVE WITH GILETTE, STATE FARM INSURANCE\" - what a buzz kill! I have geico!   Anyway - we let our waitress know and asked that though we understood it was a sports bar, could they turn down the music a smidge so we could have a non-shouting conversation- she said she would check but we never heard back. And a simple, \"no\" , could've made a world of difference in this incredulous decibel of sound.   Honestly, how stimulated do people need to be? I will not be back for fear that in the future- each person at this restaurant will have their own personal megaphone of sounds to their head, because seriously who enjoys getting their eardrums blown out? In this technological world, who needs friends or conversation anyway?",

    "text": "Beer Park is a fun place on the Strip to watch a football game and hang out with friends!  Pros - They've got a huge selection of beers, ample TVs to watch sports on and a great rooftop location across from the Bellagio fountains.  Cons - The food here is simply mediocre. If you're looking for good food at the Paris, I recommend you eat downstairs at Mon Ami Gabi.  Here's how I came up with my overall rating of a \"4.\"  Beer selection and drinks - 5 Atmosphere - 4 Food - 3 Service - 4 (Our service was friendly, but slow)  I ordered the hummus and veggies to eat. As you can see from the photo, it just wasn't anything to write home about. The veggies were pretty sparse, and the hummus was alright. My daughter ordered the braided pretzel along with fries. She thought the pretzel was along the same caliber as those served at the water park. In essence, it wasn't bad -- but it wasn't great either. Our server was super sweet, but I just felt everything took awhile ~~~ including our check.   In a nutshell ~~~ The Beer Park has great vibes and is definitely worth a visit to watch a game. However, I recommend you first eat downstairs at Mon Ami Gabi. After filling up on their wonderful food, you head upstairs to the Beer Park to drink and have a good time! :)",

This year, the word must have gotten out because it was packed & we had a hard time getting the bartender's attention as the bar was wrapped & 2-deep. So, we just got our drinks to-go & left. Bartenders were friendly, quick but busy. Drinks are $15/ea so w/ the groupon it ended up being a good value. (make sure to purchase 24hours in advance!)",

    "text": "Beware the 4.7% franchise and concessions fee.  As if paying 15 dollars for a beer wasn't enough,  Beer Park Las Vegas has a very deceptive 4.7% franchise and concessions fee in very small print on the food menu.  This is a restaurant version of a resort fee and it is incredibly shady and greedy. When I was at the bar, the bartender never gave me an itemized copy of my receipt, and I asked why my bill was 4 dollars higher than the total for 2 beers, and he said \"taxes\" and blamed it on the United States government.   A bold faced lie or maybe he was embarrassed about his employers practices. Avoid this place like the plague.  There are PLENTY of strip restaurants with a good view that do not employ these deceptive practices.  Beerhaus also has a far better beer selection without bowing down to the anheuser Busch mandatory corporate tap handles and no concessions fee and dishonest bartenders.  I contacted Beer Park and am still awaiting a response.",

But everything else is kind of a mess.  1. Went to the outdoor bar first and the bartender (I believe his name was Austin? Had two lines tattooed around his arm) was SO rude!!! My friend who I was with asked if they had a beer (I forget which beer) and he said \"um nooooo.. see all of those Budweiser logos everywhere? That means we are a Budweiser bar!\" Like she was an IDIOT! It was SO rude!  2. Went inside cause it was hot, found a nice little tabletop in the bar. I had to ask for menus- no one ever brought us any and we sat there for a good 10 min. They saw us but just never brought menus! Finally ordered an appetizer and it came out pretty quick. We got a 7 layer dip that wasn't good ...no flavor. It was just kind of eh. It was verrrrrry small too! But we were never given small plates, napkins or silverware! I had to go track them down.  3. One of the biggest gripes was HOW MANY TIMES SERVERS/FOOD RUNNERS CAME TO OUR TABLE WITH FOOD THAT WASNT OURS!!! I swear to god - there must have been 8 different times where they would come to our table saying \"did you order this?\" They just seemed SO incredibly unorganized like they didn't know what they were doing.  3/5 because they are new and will hopefully work out the kinks. As a whole the service was bad, not because the employees are terrible people but because they haven't been properly trained. We interacted with many of the employees and they were very nice (shoutout to Kyle! Who singlehandely took care of us and made sure we got what we needed).  This place has great potential but will loose customers with the service (or lack thereof).",

For the Strip it is a great price, you can get a rare import beer for what you would pay inside of the casino at any random bar for a bud light. There are also a ton of TVs! I would say beer runs between $6-10 and specialty cocktails around $12.",

We had a great spot to watch the fountains across the street.  I wish we would have stopped in earlier in our trip.  A relax place with plenty of TVs to watch the games and a great staff that made the experience enjoyable.  Amanda was our server and she was amazing.  When we arrived it was pretty slow and she had a couple of tables.  By the time we left it seemed like she had 20 tables but treated every table like it was her only one.  A personal touch that we didn't often see around Vegas.  We ordered an appetizer and a couple of entrees and she understood we didn't want to have our entrees on top of our appetizer.  She gave us some time to enjoy the food before she put our main course.    The food was great!  Definitely recommend this place to anyone...worth a trip down the strip.",

Food sounds way better on the menu than it actually tastes.

At least twice she checked on us, upsold me from one to two pitchers (which seemed reasonable since she didn't come around that often) and then never delivered them.

We could see about six tables available plus open seats at both bars.  The host asked us which we preferred and we took the bar.    We sat at the bar without even a hello from the anyone for over five minutes.  No menus, water, anything. Thinking the bartender was too busy we moved to the second bar. Same thing occurred so we thought we would try a table after choose to ten minutes.    The host didn't have any two person tables not in the sun so we social engineered to finally get a table that could sit us in the shade.  We immediately got menus and water and then proceeded to wait again.  At close to the twenty minute mark without ever getting more than a sentence with anyone, we finally called it.    As we left, our presumed waitress thanked us for coming.     Not sure what was going on here.  This was not a busy place for a weekend in Vegas.  But, was very atypical of any place surviving on the strip.",

The beer list is extensive.. but they were out of a few that we chose. We ended up with a delicious Bloody Mary and tried about 6 different draft beers. All were enjoyed.

We didn't really come to eat, but I did order the shocktop bratwurst, which was pretty good. It had a kick to eat as it was served with their version of spicy mustard.   The drinks were all pretty good, my bf had the Moscow mule which tasted like any other mule. I had the \"something\" splash which is served with fresh watermelon. It was light, sweet and very refreshing.   There's a gazillion tvs, so if you're hoping to catch a game... I'm sure they'll have it playing.",

On the day of the event, the team was super organized in the way that they would serve our 400+ attendees. They even helped us out with decorating the space and setting up our floral arrangements. The event space itself is amazing, complete with Jenga, beer pong, shuffleboard and of course an amazing view overlooking the LV strip from up above and the water show at the Bellagio. We set up our photobooth to point towards the fountains and our photos turned out lovely. Our attendees had a blast and we heard nothing but great feedback. Would totally recommend Beer Park and the wonderful team for hosting a corporate/private event. 10/10! Thanks, guys!",

    "text": "Beer Park is one of the most unique spots for sports fans in Las Vegas.  First, the view of The Strip and the Bellagio fountains (although blocked by the trees across the street) is outstanding.   Second, you really have to know where you're going to find it...and then even find the entrance. (Getting out and into the main casino floor of the Paris hotel is much easier) This isolates it from everything else and it is kind of an escape from the normal Vegas vibe.  It is basically a ton of picnic tables and bars, while you can also sit at a counter top overlooking Las Vegas Blvd or use the patio furniture seating near the pool tables.  This is a place where locals hang out and not necessarily the big gamblers. I'm guessing roughly 80% of the people here on the opening NFL Sunday were locals and about 1/3 of them were clearly Raiders fans, with the Eagles running a clear #2.  Even at 11am, it was warm in here. However, despite being outdoors, virtually every seat is covered from the sun and there's a calculated effort to keep the place comfortable despite not having air conditioning.  They have a lot of TV's, but honestly they could use another 6-8 of them and buy them a little larger. Either that or take a few that you have, split them up and scatter them around to more of the table seating. This is a bar where you should be able to see the game from any seat, but currently there are bad spots to sit if that is your primary purpose for being there.   Tremendous beer selection, but you're going to pay handsomely for it. Food prices are more in line with what you would pay anywhere else for casual dining in Vegas. Therefore, you might want to just watch the game relatively sober, enjoy a quality lunch and then play the tables to get your drink on for free after your game is over.  As much as I love Las Vegas, I also love places in Vegas where I can escape Vegas for awhile. This is one of those spots, although the views on three sides or straight up toward the Eiffel Tower will quickly remind you of where you are.",

There are plenty of cheap places in the casinos, but outside on the strip it is going to be expensive.  Vegas is a tourist trap, an adult Disney. Go to one of the remaining \"ultra lounges\" to see what expensive is.  But anyway, Hit it at a happy hour and its not bad.  This is my go to place when I first get to Vegas.  It starts the Defcon weekend out right.  Cold beer, outside with a good lunch to get things rolling. Easy to meet people and the staff is always attentive, even when busy.",

The chicken had the strangest, gummiest texture ever- like it was made from rubber. The hummus was quite alright.  The Greek salad that came with it was just plain diced cucumbers and tomatoes. No dressing, no olives, no onions, no feta. Oh wait! I did find a crumble of feta stuck to the bottom of the dish. We ate it because we were hungry, but I'm not sure about going back.",

    "text": "Beer Park serves quality food with a chill vibe that's worth checking out especially if you want a nice view of the Bellagio Fountains.  To be honest, the long line at Hexx and Mon Ami is the main reason for coming here.  From the strip in front of the Paris Hotel, you will find a sign for the Beer Park which you can reach up the flight of stairs.  With outdoor seating that is across from the Bellagio Fountains, this is a good alternative if you are waiting for those other two establishments but can't wait long.    Honestly, the food was solid but nothing amazing, a little pricier than what you expect for what you get, but it is Vegas.  The Smoked Brisket Hash hit all the points you expect from a hash with a nice mix of savory and creaminess, but falls short of being filling mainly because of the lack of meat.  The Shock Top Bratwurst had a nice smoky texture with generous pieces of grilled onions, but felt a little engulfed by the buns.  The redeeming factor for Beer Park besides the similar view of the fountains was the outdoor vide.  All the tables came with some table games.  There were also was a foosball, big connect 4, big jenga set up throughout the restaurant.  For a relaxing get together on the strip, Beer Park is definitely worth checking out.  Overall, Beer Park has all right food, but the location and the vibe makes for a welcome alternative on the strip for those who just want to hang with friends.",

    "text": "From the day Beer Park opened at Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino its only flaw was Sin City itself, summer temperatures surpassing 110F simply uncomfortable even with misting fans, though such things recently became a moot point thanks to the addition of an indoor dining area occupying what was previously part of Chateau Nightclub.  Going strong since the start of 2016, April's addition of ten Brunch items providing another facet to an experience built on Booze, Food, sports and fun, it was early-July that the long-rumored expansion finally opened its doors to guests, and although not yet 100% finished an early look suggests no expense was spared from comfortable seats and even more entertainment to a large bank of televisions that will soon be tuned to NFL Football and Golden Knights games.    Family friendly from the beginning, a novelty amongst Las Vegas Sports Bars where on-site gambling frequently necessitates \"21+ Older\" signs, it was after checking in with hostesses that four guests were seated at a spacious table, bubble hockey and arcade basketball hoops on either side for a few quarters while jumbo chess pieces and board games are available free of charge.  Built on Anheuser-Busch dollars, but tapping the talents of HeXX's Matt Piekarski and Matthew Silverman plus Pitmaster Eddie Manukyan and Chef Carol Garcia for Food, it is targeting a wide range of tastes and diets that Beer Park's current menu covers broad territory, though starters such as the whimsical Mac & Cheese Egg Rolls remain as gratuitously delicious today as they were on day one.  Brimming with Beer choices, but not lacking in terms of Cocktails including easy sippers like At The Buzzer and Badge Of Honor, it was as an alternative to Fries that \"Loaded\" Tater Tots were additionally selected to start the evening, all the ingredients contributing to the whole without overwhelming one another while Beer Park's lightly-fried Pretzel continues to set a standard unrivaled by any other spot in town.  Well aware of Beer Park's Barbeque program, but on this occasion opting to explore new items, it was beginning with a plate of marinated Chicken Breast that Beer Park showed its ability to please guests seeking something lighter than \"Bar Food,\" each element fresh and boldly flavored as were the accoutrements included with Carne Asada made from extra-lean Tri-Tip.   Opting for Onion Rings as an included Side Dish, thin cuts and light batter a welcomed change from those offered at the typical Las Vegas Sandwich spot, it was after watching Yolk cascade from top down that Beer Park's Breakfast Burger was tackled carefully, the crisp Potato Patty an enjoyable addition that, along with Bacon and Cheese, helped mellow the spicy Aioli.  Happy to see a resurgence of Fish & Chips on local menus, this version featuring flaky Cod on par with Hardway 8's stunning rendition despite the questionable inclusion of Crinkle Cut Fries, it is also great to know that Beer Park is finally now offering Dessert, HeXX's Executive Pastry Chef Miranda Prince predictably serving nothing less than excellent whether it be Brookies that retain two distinct textures, Banana Pudding gussied up without compromising its classic nature or two styles of Gooey Butter Cake from which the \"best\" comes down to a personal preference for Vanilla or Citrus.    FIVE STARS:  Already the best family-friendly place in town to watch sports, Beer Park's recently-opened indoor dining area offers air conditioning and even more fun plus plenty of great new dishes to match a variety of dining styles.",

As the sun sets it is beating down right on the deck so it could get pretty hot but once it goes down the view is great.  Getting a seat along the rail is a must but can be hard but worth the effort. Seating is first come first serve so keep your eyes out.    Once seated were were taken  care of pretty quick.  Actually given the crowds the service was impressive.    Large beer selection and pub food options.  You can get flights of beers so you can sample a few.  There is also a decent cocktail and wince selection so there is something for everyone.    I tried multiple different beers and we got some tots to go long with them. Great place to unwind a little and watch the fountains and crazy strip traffic.",

What I liked the most was that we were outside but the temp was great. Between the inside air coming out, giant fans, and evaporative cooling via overhead misting system made for pleasant temps while enjoying being outside. Extensive draft beer menu.

While the location and view of the Vegas strip is fantastic - the awful lack of accurate and attentive service far outweighs the enjoyment of coming here.  Portions are small. Prices are high. Music is loud - but hey, it's Vegas so whatever. I had a burger. It was okay. My husband had a chicken sandwich - also very okay. Had to wait ages to even order -  so we started ordering 2 beers at a time not knowing if/when the waitress would ever come back.  The most exciting part, you ask, they tack on a licensing fee at the end of your bill that's in super fine print on the menu. Hello capitalism. Goodbye Beer Park....forever.",

    "text": "I think Beer Park was a necessary addition to the strip. With sports bar vibes, lots of large TV's, counter seating overlooking the strip, and a nice rooftop open-air view of the Bellagio Fountains you have the perfect mix of elements. They have games to play as well.   I have to say, I did come here thinking they served craft beer but it's owned by Budweiser so they only serve beers under their label. There are a few craft beers but not a huge range. Prices are expensive! I believe it's $8 or $8.50 for a Bud Light and it goes up from there. So it might be better to pregame rather than have a ton of drinks here. I went with the Superbowl Shandy ($13) which was a beer cocktail consisting of Shock Top, Blood Orange Vodka, Aperol, lemon and lime. It was refreshing and I ordered a second. My bf is super picky about Micheladas but he ordered their version which is made with a Michelada mix and he approved. They also offer beer flights and a few cocktails.   There is an average-sized menu which mainly consists of items for snacking and sharing, but also has some entrees, sandwiches and burgers. We had just come from lunch but we couldn't pass up the Beer Park Pie. Super cheesy mac n cheese was topped with sweet pulled pork, crunchy Fritos and fresh jalapenos. We enjoyed the unique dish and the mac was the best part since they didn't skimp on the cheese. I wish the pork wasn't so sweet and it was a bit on the dry side but overall I think it's worth a try. BP is a cool spot to spend a few hours or catch a game. The vibe was definitely rowdy on a Saturday afternoon.",

We were probably one of three tables, and it was so slow.   Food was slow to get to us, servers were slow to get to us, everyone was kinda just standing around. And again, I get it, when its slow and there are only 3 tables, it's easy to space out twiddle your thumbs, but I wanted to get my mini vacation started and I was so turned off by the atmosphere, I couldn't get out of there faster.  Maybe it's better at night time?  One positive, ordered the ahi salad, it was bomb. That's all.",

The food comes out quickly and hot. They wear these skimpy shorts, but most are tasteful, not offensive by Vegas standards.  The food is good. I ordered the Falafel Burger, just because I've had falafels before and I was wondering what a burger might taste like.  It definitely tasted like a falafel, flavorful and easy to eat.  Aa you can tell from the pictures, there are many choices for beer on tap. I'm a Guinness drinker ($12.25 for 16 oz/$16.25 for 23 oz) because I love beer that I can chew.  This place has plenty of seating for groups, and counter space for lone wolves. Video screens are everywhere; I watched the Concacaf Gold Cup Final with ease; I saw four screens clearly from my seat.  Five stars because it has what anyone in the Strip wants: good quick service, fresh suds, and people all around.",

Highly recommend the homemade blue cheese dressing.  Ask to substitute it, if you order the cobb salad.  BEWARE - This restaurant charges a \"Concession and Franchise Fee\" that is 4.7% of your bill.  They disclose it in the fine print at the bottom of the menu with the \"thoroughly cooked food/food borne illness\" language.  Just a cheap money grab.  If you come here, you will pay this fee.",

The portions are on the small side. They forgot my co-workers fries. They had already finished their burgers and asked for them 3 times before they finally came out. I got the mac and cheese egg rolls, which, in theory, sound amazing. They were gross. I think the problem is that they took them out of the fryer too soon- same thing with those late french fries. They were not even golden brown. My friend who I was splitting the check with got the ahi tuna salad. She liked it, saying it was better than Cheesecake Factory's version. My advice, stick to the beer flight and go someplace else to eat.",

    "text": "Came here with the wife and 2 kids on a Tuesday night. Sat in  the patio to watch the Bellagio fountains. The outside heat lamp was not working and I could not get it to work. After about 10 minutes of waiting and no waiters coming around, I went to the bar area to see about ordering drinks and some food. Female bartender was right on the other side of the bar doing something. Finally she looks up, takes a look at me and walks away before I can ask anything. Now it was a Tuesday night after Christmas so it was not busy as well. So I go back to our table in the patio to see if anyone had come by. I finally see a waiter walking around and ask if I can grab a menu and order. He says they do not serve the patio area and I would have to go to the bar...oookayyy. Go to the second bar (there are two bars upstairs) and ask about the heater and grabbing a menu. The response for the heat lamp was that if it is not on, there is no propane. There were 4-5 heat lamps I saw and none of them were on. I went to try and turn them all on and sure enough none of them were working. C'mon it is in the 40's in Vegas at this time and there is no propane?  The bartender did not even try to help or make any suggestions. So we went down to Hexx which is right below this place. Glad we went to Hexx as service was much better and they had working heat lamps. Been to many different bars/restaurants in my day, but this place was one of the worst. Workers just seem to not care.",

Problem is there is always a sporting event on everyday. They can say it's not usable at will. This place is absolutely crooked and corrupt as this is a blatant bait and switch. It's a horrible way of doing business and the manager was horrible about dealing with it. The manager was not willing to work with us at all. Horrible customer service from the manager. Avoid.",

It appears server ended her shift and never put our order in.  We had to stop another server and reorder.  I would have thought someone would have checked on us but... Someone came an apologized but we figured the food still didn't match the price.   I spent the next 3 hours calming the wife down.",

    "text": "Choosing to go here on one of the hottest and muggiest days of Vegas' monsoon summer season probably wasn't one of my wisest choices, but for the beer cheese dip and cold beer offered up here I'd do it again and again and again.  The Widmere berry lime heffe was amazingly refreshing, paired with a warm soft pretzel dipped in cheese sauce and homemade ground mustard.  For lunch I had the buffalo bleu cheese burger, which included a slaw topping that was crispy and cold but complimented nicely with the hot charred burger underneath it.  I couldn't stop eating it, nor could I the tater tots!  My friend had the pickled jalapeno and candied bacon pineapple burger that was equally as good (the jalapenos are diced up too, so when you bite into them you don't get an overwhelming sensation of heat and jalapenos).  Seating is very casual, picnic style mixed with high tops and a bar, with hard plastic \"paper\" plates and Red Solo cups on top of turf grass under canopies that shield you from Vegas' hot summer days and misters and fans that help keep you cool.  There are a bunch of TVs to watch various sports shows, as well as table games and yard games should you be up for some friendly competition while overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.  The only down side was the hostess.  She clearly wasn't thrilled about being there that day, and seemed to have lost her ability to smile.  But, hey, it was hot and muggy.  Maybe just an off day for her.  Who knows.  Def will do this again.",

    "text": "I had heard lots of good things about this place and after reading the reviews on Yelp we decided to give it a try.  We are locals and rarely go to the strip these days.  Going there completely reminded us why we don't go to the strip anymore.  The food was meh, wasn't bad, wasn't anything to rave about.  I know I make a MUCH better burger at home and I can get the same wings at Buffalo Wild Wings.  The atmosphere is pretty unique, I will give them that.  It's just sad that this place, along with many more to follow, like a mindless heard of sheep, are continuing to punk people for excessive bullsh*t fees!  Really?  CNF charge of 4.7% for exactly what?  Not one single possible reason could ever justify that ridiculous fee.  Right up there with sleazy resorts bending people over and shoving it up their butts with the ever so popular \"resort fees\".   I would bet you anything that 99% of the people don't even know about this sneaky fee tapped onto their bill.  Sure it's on the menu (as it was pointed out to me after I questioned what it was, in the smallest font possible) and I never got a clear reason why.  It's a money grab, simple as that.  Perhaps to many of you 4.7% means nothing to you, it is such a small amount after all.  This is True, it is a small amount.  It is the principle behind it.  If you need to make more money then just tack that onto the cost of the food!  Just one more way The Strip is chasing away the locals.  Which actually is quite fine.  The Strip is meant for vacationers willing to settle for the smoke and mirrors of Vegas.  Regardless of this tacky sneaky fee, I wouldn't have gone back just because of the mediocre food.    As a side note, when I got home I did some background search about the latest money grab.  It turns out this isn't the only place in Vegas pulling this stunt.  Cabo Wabo (why would you eat that crap food is beyond me) Hexx Kitchen and the cheap rip off from the real Senor Frog's are all guilty of this shameless practice.",

Tried the BBQ burger and it was an experience in itself with great flavor and if you don't like it too spicy just have them put the jalapeno coleslaw on the side. We also tried the dirty fries and they were very tasty with the flavorful brisket. The Mac and cheese egg rolls were just okay in my opinion but my daughter liked them. What's also neat is they have games on each table that makes it for a fun experience! Ask for Teri when you come, she's awesome and takes great care of you!",

We were looking for an outdoor bar, and funny enough, there aren't too many on the Strip. I assume because it's usually sweltering hot the majority of the time? But anytime I've ever been was not those times, so I just wanted a place to enjoy the \"warmer\" weather while back home there was snow!  They have a great selection of beers on tap, as well as some bottles. I tried a really tasty apricot beer, that was so easy to drink, I had two! I also love that there was ample table and couch seating. You could lounge around or sit at the large bar. Plus, they had a couple pool tables you could play if you wanted.   It's a pretty large bar that's elevated atop the Paris casino and hotel. It's weird because the aesthetic doesn't fit in with the Paris theme at all, but whatever, it was a fun!",

I'm not a huge beer drinker so paying $12-15 for draft beer is little steep for me but I had a friend in town this past weekend so I decided to bring them to beer park for the atmosphere and the awesome view of the strip. Our bartender Taylor greeted us almost immediately with a smile. My friend being the beer snob his is tested Taylor's knowledge and their beer selection and she passed with flying colors. She definitely knew her stuff! I ordered my usual cocktail but Taylor suggested a try a new flavor of Deep Eddy that I had never tried and I loved it. We decided on a couple appetizers that are pretty standard for most bars (wings & sliders) and they were pretty good. Like I said I've been to Beer Park a few times but mostly for the atmosphere but our Bartender made this visit a lot more enjoyable!",

The view is just amazing from there we got to enjoy the water show across the street that happens at Bellagio. They have all sorts of games for you to play like jenga, pool, connect four, beer pong etc. The only thing we were missing was some music to dance to.  The food was really good! I enjoyed the beer park pie! The Mac and cheese in there was delicious. My wife enjoyed her popcorn chicken but the fries here are addicting so be careful! The drinks were so delicious. I tried the park tea and Moscow mule which is definitely the best I've ever had! I enjoyed that there wasn't an over pour and I could actually enjoy it! But they also weren't skimpy drinks. My wife enjoyed creating beer flights to be able to taste a lot of the options.   Now I'm saving the best for last! The customer service was beyond amazing!!!!! Our bartender was Alyssa who was so friendly and super funny! She was attentive all night even when she started getting super busy. Thank you for such a great night for my wife's birthday! This will definitely be a bar that we visit often!",

You have to chase the bartenders down for service and then they give you attitude when you do (He even gave us the \"be right with you\" finger when our neighbors spilled their beer and broke glass). And I'm talkin' actually sitting at the bar for drinks and dinner over an hour. The beers are so expensive. And the food isn't all that much better and is just meh. Our bill was $150 for 3 beers, one appetizer and 2 entrees plus a microscopic side. The most attention we got was when the bartender was changing shift and wanted us to cash out. So, raise your hand, say hey! and hand over your wallet if you decide to come here.",

It had lots of creamy Mac & cheese and loads of meat with very few chips. Last nights visit was not as good. Ordered the same dish but it was definitely not as good as before. Mac & cheese was dried out and not much of it. Not much meat and LOADED with chips - maybe trying to make it look like a nicer serving than it was? I would've mentioned something to our server but he never stopped to ask how things were. Granted, the first visit was early afternoon and the second was about 9:00 P.M. but I don't think it was overly busy as it was not a weekend. We will go back based upon first visit but walked away disappointed last evening.",

Sat down, bartender (Daniel), looks over, sees me, and Goes about his business. The bar top was 3/4 at this point. A few minutes later, he says he'll be right back with a menu.  Two gals sit. He greets them. They get menus. I get it, ladies first.  He finally circles back. I get a beer menu.  Here's the mistake on my part: I should've ordered right then and there.  Takes him longer to circle back to get my order. Now I realize why his side of the bar was 3/4 empty.  Saw people eating food. Didn't offer a food menu. Daniel definitely does not need to be in the bar business. Awful. Just awful service.  Spend your money somewhere else. Tilted Kilt. Not great, but completely more competent staff. And WTF is the CNF\" fee at the bottom of Beer Park's bill? Beware...",

I love that it has an awesome view of the strip along with TV for sports, sometimes live music and games to play! (Jenga, Connect 4, etc.) It's outdoors located on the second level by the front entrance of the Paris Casino. The summer heat may be unbearable but once the sun goes down, it's great! A lot of fans for summer and heaters for winter! (I've been here multiple times.)  I have yet to try their food but know they have a full bar and wide selection of beer. It's on the strip so of course a little more pricey than your average neighborhood bar.",

    "text": "I'd say this is my new favorite bar on the strip. The drinks are about $15 per pint, but I enjoyed the uninterrupted view of the strip and the ample seating on a Saturday evening. They have bar seating that overlooks the strip but also wooden tables over artificial grass turf for group seating.  We didn't try any of the food items but their beers are solid, as are their Micheladas. Nothing out of the ordinary, but if you're just looking for a chill spot with a group of friends, Beer Park it is. It was the perfect spot for us to kill some time before the club. Not as extensive of a menu as Yard House, but if you're looking for something you can't find in the LA area, again, this is it.   They were playing reruns of The Sandlot and had table games (giant Jenga) which proved to be a nice break from typical Vegas.   They have elevators that you can use from inside the restaurant downstairs, otherwise, use the outside stairs.",

For starters, it's elevated location makes for a great view of the strip including the Bellagio's fountain right across the street. There are tons of TVs making it a great place to watch sports. They have some bar games including pool, giant jenga, and shuffleboard.  I didn't have anything to eat here so I can't speak to the food, but they beer selection was incredible-- tons of beers to choose from including plenty of crafts. Our bartenders were friendly and attentive as well. As much as I enjoyed this place, I'm not giving it 5 starts because of the prices. Drinks are very expensive (23 oz Guinness was $16), which is hardly a surprise for a place like this in this location, but still. But I'll happily go back if/when I'm in Vegas again.",

    "text": "Found out about this new place while checking in for the Mystere Rehearsals at TI. We decided to check it out spontaneously after we finished the rehearsals. It is fairly easy to get to, I recommend parking in The Paris Hotel garage and walking through the hotel to the main entrance. Once you step outside on Las Vegas Blvd, it is located on the right. At the bottom of the patio, there is a cool little bar that people can walk up to and get a drink to go. One can order a simple beer but also available are the more touristy, fruity slurpee drinks. We headed upstairs where the main patio is located. We got a nice table and had a great view of the Bellagio fountains, The Cosmopolitan, and the Eiffel Tower at The Paris Hotel. The beer menu is extensive with a long list of draft beers and craft bottled beers. As a craft beer lover, I was pleased with the choices. We had already eaten so we didn't order any food although the waffle fries looked good as they floated by covered in a creamy, cheesy garlic sauce. Mmmmm they smelled delish!   The patio is large and extensive with a bar and plenty of seating. There are several large and small tables under a patio with tarp like shades. There are a couple of areas where you can play life size versions of Jenga and Connect Four. Also they have a couple of pool tables to use as well. We had amazing service from our server. She was prompt with delivery of our drinks and checked on us often. They do allow tastings of the draft beers in case you are undecided.   Overall, I liked this place. The views are phenomenal and at night with all the hotels lit up, I am sure it is even better. I plan to return when it warms up a bit more, pull up a barstool overlooking the boulevard and people watch.",

We watch the Georgia Florida game and had the pleasure of being helped by Laura Madison and Cole.  These three ladies working like crazy but took the time to smile take a couple pictures and laugh along with us. I've sent quite a few people here and when I told my UK clients that I was there, they immediately asked how Madison was. Apparently they were taken with this mixed martial arts beauty/bartender. All the ladies had great costumes on that were not overly sexy and ridiculous. A scarecrow a zombie cheerleader and rowdy Roddy piper were all perfect for that day. Thank you for a wonderful time. Will be back soon with more friends. The food was good the alcohol prices were a bit steep but that's to be expected if you're on the strip and how nice the place is. Ps. Definitely definitely try the smoked barbecue drumsticks. They were absolutely delicious!",

We could have stayed here most of the night, but alas it is Las Vegas at Christmas. Plenty of heaters for the night time coolness and even in December it was not uncomfortable to be outside. It is totally covered so rain or shine it's a great place to hang out and have a beer with family, friends or even a stranger or two.

They took my number but I assured them that I would be back as the game started in a couple of hours.  They called me and left a message that I had to call back and confirm my reservation.  I call back and of course I am put through a prompt menu and nobody answers so I leave a message confirming my reservation.  Clearly I am annoyed since I assured the hostess that I was coming back and now, an hour before the game, I don't know if anyone monitors that voicemail and I'm unsure if I now have a legit reservation.  Show up for 5pm and the place is 70% full so we are seated (2 of us) no problem - relief.  Now this is my 3rd time to Beer Park - so I know what to expect....great view, great atmosphere, mediocre food and of course the CNF fee.  Even with these realistic expectations - I felt let down.  We had the mac & cheese egg rolls and chili verde nachos.  The mac & cheese rolls were bland and tasteless...similar to sawdust rolled up and fried in a wonton.  The nachos were better, a little on the soggy side but they were reasonably tasty.  We had a drink each per period - so a total of 6 (beer for me & touchdown smash for her) and the waitress absolutely rushed us out of there with an attitude.  It was not that busy and they definitely did not need to turn over our table.  And we clearly told the waitress from the time we arrived that we were there to watch the game.  So good-bye Beer Park....fool me once - shame on you....fool me three times - shame on me.  You can take your mediocre, over-priced food, server attitude and CNF fee and pound sand....definitely won't be back.  I wanted so badly to like this place and make it a regular stop.  I guess when you've got the right location, you can pretty much treat customers however you want.......",

Always, they have great beer on tap. First day we just did drinks and some tots. Second day we did a Saturday brunch. I think we stayed for maybe 4 hours. We had a great time just hanging out, and eating.....ugh, have you had the hangover breakfast??? Fried chicken sandwich, egg, some yummy chipotle sauce, the bread, some more tots and man....it's amazing. I ate it all! And, someone please tell the manager to sell those great shirts that the servers have. I for sure loved the every day black ones, but when I saw the hot pink shirts for brunch, I was begging our waitress to sell me hers! So, many people would buy those!!!

Their signature punch cocktail was amazing! My favorite food item was their mac and cheese egg roll appetizers, they were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, paired with two flavorful dipping sauces. I tried a burger for my entree- satisfactory but nothing special. I did really like their unique shareable entrees section of the menu, in concept and some of the offerings.   My favorite part of the evening was the overall views of the Strip, particularly of the incredible Bellagio fountains right across the street! If you get a spot towards the edge of their patio the view is unmatched by any bar or restaurant in the area (except for in the Bellagio obviously).   Overall, the unique ambiance and comfort food classics ensure I will definitely be back in the near future!",

    "text": "TLDR: great view of the bellagio. But less than stellar burgers.   This place has a great view of the bellagio and its fountains. My friends and I were constantly asking ourselves if cannons were going off with the loud bangs in the background. Tables were all outfitted with different games like jenga. Decor was also solid with a more upscale sports bar appearance.   Food wise, appetizers were fairly solid. The burger however was quite lackluster. It didn't have enough kick and could've used maybe a little more salt. It was perfectly tender cooked at medium, but lacked that little bit of oomph. Served on a pretzel bun ish style bun which was good. I got the guacamole burger which has good toppings but the burger itself was a little lacking. Drink prices are fairly average for Vegas.  If this place wasn't in Vegas I might give it a higher review, but with standards so high there I couldn't give it higher than a 3 with the burger a little lacking.",

We actually tip very well for God's service which hers was quite the contrary. I'm not sure why you employ such an employee when there are tons of people in this town that can do a stellar job over her.

Beer Park is perfectly situated in front of *Paris* on the second floor with wide views of Las Vegas BLVD from the spectacular Bellagio water fountains across the street to the Eiffel Tower up above.. what a perfect venue to drop by during the day or especially at night. Inside the ambiance and vibes are nice with a rooftop feel and lots of great beers on draft. They also have water misters to beat the heat outside and the DJ was spinning great hip hop and throwbacks around 8pm the Wednesday night I came by. Sweet!   Nichollete was our server the night I came here and she gave the best service. She was on top of everything and gave a great impression for my first time here. They also have a full bar in addition to the beer selection along with food, beer flights (Any 4 6oz from draft beer menu for $14), beer cocktails, and other specialty cocktails. I enjoyed the beer and cocktails, but the waffle fries meat and cheese which was yummy (however I would recommend skipping the egg which we added for an extra 2 bucks). I also liked the large connect four they had which  we also played with that night. This place can get pricey as my group got carried away, but when in Vegas might as well enjoy with food, shots, drinks, and beer!   Overall, I highly recommend for the special ambiance, lots of great beer variety on tap, and last but not least food for the hungry.~",

It's open so on a nice day, you get to enjoy the weather but not bake in the sun. It's massive. There are games everywhere, plenty of seating, full bar and bomb food. Why are people hating?  We sat at the bar on Saturday and was not sure what to expect. We got a seat immediately at the bar top. Alyssa took care of us and was awesome. From a fellow bartender, this girl killed it. She was extremely friendly, talkative, attentive, funny and made a killer drink. She had plenty of recommendations and had no problem making adjustments to drinks (I'm weak and can't drink gin).   The food was soooo good. Way better then I thought. the garlics fries. ORDER THEM. Addicting. The bacon mayo on the side? Even more addicting. The burger was great and the brats were even better. They have TV's everywhere and great specialty cocktails. Love the glass solo cups. Nice touch.   Come here. it's worth it. you'll get way more then you bargained for.",

First time here but I will frequent it whenever I am in Vegas. It's a get away from all the hustle and bustle from the Vegas strip. It's sort of a roof top bar, but it's not super high up. Great views of Bellagio and the fountain show that happens every 15 minutes. Also a great place to people watch and watch the traffic go by.  They serve all sorts of beers. We only did one round and did not try any of the food. I'd like to try the food next time. Seemed like it was just appi's but the food we saw looked decent and like typical bar food. The prices were normal, we got 2 beers and the total was like $21 bucks.   They have tables and also bar stools across the edge of the roof, where the view is great. The bar stools were extremely uncomfy! My bum def hurt by the time we left! So that's one thing I would change about this place. Other than that, the ambiance is very chill and there are games all around which is super fun! It was a hot night and they had cool air flowing so it was comfy. The people that come here seem to be very laid back and normal, which is a nice change from the regulars of Vegas. I was way too over dressed because we had plans prior and after Beer Park, but I could have worn shorts and a tee and would have fit right in!  The bartenders were nice and efficient and the music playing was great! I actually was a huge fan of the music at this spot. We were singing away to the classics that were played. I would def recommend this place for all those who aren't about the party scene anymore in Vegas, which I am def over! Beer Park, I am a fan!!",

It has a great open feel to it and lots to do - there's shuffle board, board games, card games, giant Jenga, table soccer, etc. They have a retractable awning/roof for when the weather is nice and plenty of fans/misters.  The bartenders are super friendly and they have a great selection of beers. Although a little pricey, I enjoyed their summer shandy. The food is tasty too - we tried the braided pretzels with the beer cheese. I could have eaten the beer cheese all by itself and been completely content.  They have tons of TVs to watch your favorite sports event (it was the NBA finals while we were there) and the whole atmosphere was electric. I'm a big fan of the Beer Park and will definitely be back to hang out again.",

Atmosphere - You can see the place from the street.  I was spending most of my time at the Flamingo.  So I head down the street heading south.  I see the stairs, the door is locked.  Which I figure you need to enter from the inside of Paris.  I took the elevator near the bar, which took me to the night club and was ushered out quickly.  I was told use a door and turn to the right.  Wow so much easier coming from the south going north.  The stairwell is very visible.  So it a large bar on the roof top of the first floor looking out onto the strip.   The place was packed already at 5:30 on a Saturday night on cool fall night.  I wonder how popular this place is during hot summer nights.      Food   Drinks - This is AB InBev bar which means that there is a lot their beers which you can order.  I had the Joe, an IPA from 10 Barrel for $12 plus tip.  The one cool thing is that they have is the Goose Islands sister beers, which living in Reno those are pretty rare.  Since it was just me and I like sours but not enough to finish off 765 ml bottle, I had to skip on them.  Service - Sitting with money in my hand looking at three different employees that were not waiting on any customers was frustrating.  Finally someone paid attention, wham bam and done.  Just a stare to indicate they are ready for my order.  Beer arrives and the huge price tag.  Fine the place is packed but a smile and hello would be nice.  Future - Probably not with the prices here.",

If your in the area, I would recomend coming here.",

So great,  we cut our family trip a day short in Cali,  to spend another day in Vegas and watch the NBA Finals again. MC needs a raise, in Vegas where no one remembers you, she remembered our boys,  brought games over for them, and provided great service both times. We will definitely  be back in a couple months again. Much Love from Denver MC!!!",

Coming from Long Island, I didn't expect them to have Blue Point, but they did!  (now a Budweiser product).  This trip was strictly a beer run, and I had several delicious beers.  I didn't try the food, but could see what my neighbors were eating, especially the wings, and they looked fantastic.

You can actually see the fountain go off from where you are seated! The atmosphere is really nice! There are a ton of TV's playing sports games, good music & table games for you to play while you wait. There's a huge variety of beers, but I'd recommend getting the sampler flight so you can try different options! Mixed drinks are also good and really sweet. The food is reallllly good! I'd come here again just for the food. The garlic fries are amazing, as are the burgers. There's also a baconaise sauce they use that's pretty tasty! I'd come here again the next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "This is a cool place to watch a game. Great atmosphere. TV's everywhere, ice cold beers on tap. Still has that 'new' feel to it. Everyone had their teams colors on. What more can you ask for? But for us, there were some negatives.  The bad: it was 95 degrees out by kickoff at 1pm. My arms were getting a little scorched as the sun would peak through gaps in the awning overhead. My wife was starting to look uncomfortable. I asked one of the servers about the misters I had read about that help keep the place cool. She said she'd check with her manager about that. She returned after a few minutes and said they don't turn them on this time of year because it doesn't get hot enough. Um, okay. Its 95 degrees out! It doesn't make any sense whatsoever to have this feature for the comfort of your guests but decide not to turn it on even though it was a scorching hot day.   We ordered the pretzel with queso dip and the mac and cheese egg rolls to start. They were both good except they both came out piping hot and the heat made it a little hard to enjoy the food.  We suffered through a half of football before leaving to find somewhere to watch the rest of the game indoors with some AC.  Honestly, if it were not for the issues we encountered with the heat this place would merit a solid 4 stars.  Note: A couple reviewers mentioned a $35 per person minimum for Sunday football. I called to inquire about the minimum per person charge and was told it was in fact $50 per person. When we got there we were prepared to stay 3+ hours to watch an entire game and were willing to pay that but no one mentioned anything about a minimum charge. And since we only ended up staying for half of the game and only ordered 2 appetizers to share and a beer each we didn't get anywhere close to $50 or even $35 per person. When we asked for the bill we paid for what we ordered and left. Obviously I'm not complaining but I thought they were inconsistent with this policy. I guess it depends on who you get and what type of mood they are in on any given Sunday.",

We get home to discover that everything we ordered was actually more expensive than what the menu said. Even the pool tables were the worst I've ever played on. They were barely standing.

My family and I arrived around 6:30 on this past Friday, we were greeted by a friendly hostess she asked how many we told her 4...then another RUDE hostess interrupts and says you will have to sit at bar, all table are reserved. We were confused since we had under age kids with us, but we went to bar and found seats. The bartender asked for our kids IDs and we explained the situation that happened. He stated to us SINCE THEY ARENT THAT BUSY we would have to be seated at a table...We laughed and said that's what we wanted all along! He had a manger take us IMMEDIATLY to a table!! I guess they weren't all reserved. We had an awesome table with a view of the Bellagio water show. We had a beer sampler, ate nachos and garlic fries and played words against humanity..We had so much fun. I would say that the nachos were big but could have used a lot more of the toppings..Never the less they were delicious...SO I guess I should thank that rude hostess because due to her unwillingness to help us and be kind we ended up with a 5 star experience. I would come back here in a heart beat!!",

Jenga was the only game I had at my table and the pool table really small clear in the back. They do have a decent selection of beers sadly not enough local beer on tap. Food is unique but bar food at best. If I would have known I would have had beer only. Maybe more card games at tables such as cards against humanity or drunk stoned or stupid games geared towards beer drinking or putting the large games out on the floor instead of tucking them away to fit more tables would be nice.",

Our party of 6 were thirsty and seated in the sun, we wanted a cool beverage and to be served a warm bottled beer just turned us all off.  Don't get me wrong, The Beer Park is a great idea.  Great place to watch a game or play giant board games like Jenga or Connect 5.  It gets packed so go early if you want to see your game or to get a table in the shaded area.    Beer selection is great and they offer a sample flight of 4 (6oz) tasters for $15! The beers on tap were cold but watch out for the bottled ones.  We ordered a Grapefruit Sculpin and the bottle was warm. Hahaha yes, I still can't get over it.    Don't bother trying to order a beer at the bar either.  The girls ignore you until they are finished with their personal conversations behind the bar.    I hear there's a new Beer Haus so maybe I'll try them out next time...lets just hope they don't serve warm beer too! Hahaha",

I asked what that meant. \"It's a concession fee.\" What does that mean? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. SERIOUSLY. NOTHING. No one there could explain it. It's just a fee they tack on to charge you more. Most people, apparently, don't even notice because they're pretty wasted by the time they pay their bill.   Apparently, there's a notice on the menu literally slipped into the same small print notice about eating undercooked eggs. Had to wait a bit to post this so my review wasn't laden with profanity, but honestly...never stepping foot in there again. Also will warn every out of town guest about this nonesense as well. Just hope it doesn't spread to other restaurants on the strip.   Just price the menu items at the higher price. Sheesh!",

Ok for a tailgate but not for the price they charge.  We had a beer and pretzel (which was ok.  Not the worst but not the best).  Might be good for beer and that's it. Agree with others, service was slow.",

    "text": "This place has a peak location at Paris across from the Bellagio Fountains. Good viewing place!   2 very large bars upstairs with cute picnic tables. Drinks are served in heavy duty Red Solo Cups.  They have a very large draft beer selection and also serve bar and grill food.  Our bartender was friendly. We shared a beer flight. You get 4, 7oz glasses of your choice for around $15. We shared a full 16oz beer as we played old school games, such as Connect 4.  We loved the vive up here and will definitely come back!",

We were seated for 15 minutes before we were acknowledged. after another 15 minutes we went to the bar and ordered our drinks  where we were promptly served. Watch out for the CNF tax that adds another $2.50 to each drink.",

    "text": "Really liked the atmosphere and vibe of this place.  Love the decor and outside setting. A group of us went and sat on the couches.  My only complaint is by the couches and the pool tables it gets really warm under the sun. Would be nice if there was more shade especially when it gets super hot - maybe a roll-out awning. Had a great time playing pool and jenga. They also have a connect 4 game. The food was also really good. I got the ahi tuna salad which was huge and very tasty. Only complaint was the ahi was really salty to the point I had to scrape some of the seasoning off.  The reason I gave this place a 3 was because I think they need to adjust some of their prices.  I didn't feel like drinking so I got a soda-- cost me $4.95 for it. Had I known I would have gone across the street and bought a bottle at CVS.  However the salad was $15.95 which to me is reasonable for ahi especially considering the portion size.",
