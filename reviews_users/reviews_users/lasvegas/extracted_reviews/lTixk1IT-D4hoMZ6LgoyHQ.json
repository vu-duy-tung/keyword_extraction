    "text": "Happy Birthday Kalani!  Went to the Barrymore for my friends birthday dinner.  I don't know how he does it, but he always manages to find that special place off the beaten path for dinner.  The Barrymore is located in the Royal Resort, an older Hotel/Timeshare property off the strip across from the indoor skydiving place.  Don't let the exteriors and neighborhood distract you.  Make a reservation and give this place a try.  When we walked into the restaurant I felt like we were in a time warp.  The Barrymore has an \"old school\" Vegas kind of vibe.  Seems like a place where people who don't want to be seen would go, like where you'd take your mistress not your wife...to the booth in the back in the corner in the dark.  The dining room was really intimate and cozy, loved the velvet booths, nice touch.  Ambiance 5 stars!    We started our evening with cocktails, the room demanded it.  I had the Harvest, it was a nice combination of fall flavors.  The wine list is extensive, you could go balls out and order the Screaming Eagle Cab for 5100 bucks.  For the non \"high rollers\" they offer 50 wines for less than 50 bucks.  We had a great Zinfandel that landed somewhere in between price points and went well with our meal.  Our server Oscar helped us navigate the menu and explain the evenings offerings.  We shared the Lobster Mac and Cheese and Pan Seared Foie Gras starters.  I loved the mac and cheese, really creamy flavors that highlighted the chunks of Maine lobster rather than over power it.  I didn't sample the Foie Gras, but my friends were ooohing and aaahing over the flavors.  They loved it.  For dinner we ordered:  The Buffalo Rib Eye, I eat buffalo burgers often so thought this a good choice for something different, great flavor.  I asked for medium rare, but it came out more rare/raw in the center so most of it was left on the plate.  The Short Ribs were nothing short of amazing, so tender and flavorful, the winning dish of the night if you ask me.  The third dish was a Petite Fillet, my friend said it was like buttah.  We all shared the Asparagus Risotto, crisp asparagus with creamy rice, yum!  No meal is complete without a little dessert.  After consuming the delicious bread selections, appetizers, and entrees we elected to share a little something.  Kalani chose the Creme Brulee, his favorite and a must try all over the planet.  He was not disappointed with this preparation.    A great birthday feast for my friend Kalani.  A great weekend in Vegas.  I cannot wait to see what the birthday dinner will be this year....after all, his birthday will be on 12-12-12.  Hmmmm....we've got a few months to figure it out~  BTW,  I saw an amazing cheeseburger and fries walk past during our dinner service.  I'm sorry I didn't make it back for a late lunch to try it out...  Next time I guess...",

    "text": "Okay...anyone who frequents Las Vegas knows that many of the very best chefs in the world have restaurants there. It is literally a city oozing with 5 star sauces. The problem is, many of the restaurants are jammed into smoky casinos, overpriced, and often focus on the show more than the food.  Sure...go to Switch once and watch in awe as the walls change and the roof rotates before your eyes.  It will be entertaining, and take your mind off the fact that you are about to get a $400 bill.  Everyone should experience it at least once. No pain no gain.  For those of you who consider a night \"off the strip\" somewhat of a victory however, I strongly  recommend that you give The Barrymore a try.  It does not have flashy dancers, crazy lasers, moving walls, ice sculptures, or celebrity chefs.  What it does have however, is old Vegas charm and...oh yeah...excellent food.    The ambiance is more Lionel Barrymore than Drew Barrymore in almost every respect.  The dining room is warm and cozy with plush booths and a classy 40's-style movie motif.  One truly feels as if they might just look in the booth next to them and catch a glimpse of Bogey or Grant sipping on a cosmopolitan with a lady friend.    The staff is great as well.  From the time we walked in and sat down, we received flawless service.  Our head waiter was dressed in a white dinner jacket and looked as if he could have just finished serving Lionel himself.  He was fully familiar with the dinner menu, bar specialties, and did not hesitate to offer his opinion on wine choices.   The evening manager also stopped by our table, introduced himself, and asked about our experience.   We dined on NY Strip steak, braised short ribs, and a wonderful risotto. Each dish was well executed, top quality, and very enjoyable. The highlight was a wonderful roasted artichoke, which still haunts my taste buds two weeks later.   So, if you are in Vegas looking for a flashy trendy restaurant named after some celebrity on the Food Network, you may be happier on the strip eating a $35 shrimp cocktail with the din of slot machines in the background.  If however, you are looking for a classy, elegant, dining experience with a real \"old Vegas\" feel.  Give The Barrymore a try.  The difference is black and white!",

    "text": "My husband took me here to celebrate my birthday. I've been wanting to check this place out and what a perfect excuse to throw down some Benjamins. We walked in and I instantly like the place just by the decor. It's like Mad Men meets stylish interior decorator....way cute place! The restaurant isn't too big itself probably 8 booths, 2 large tables and a smaller table.   We started off with the Lobster Deviled Eggs and Softshell Crab appetizer. The deviled eggs were good, but probably a lil too oily for my tastes. Softshell Crab appetizer was good, not my favorite but still good seeing as how softshell crab isn't my favorite. For dinner I ordered the surf and turf filet with 1/2 a lobster and my husband ordered the Cowboy ribeye. My filet was pretty tasty, BUT not as tasty as the Cowboy Ribeye that the husband got! Both pieces of meat were tender and flavorful. My lobster was a lil bit over cooked as it was a bit rubbery, but for 18.99 for half a lobster I think that's a bargain. Only thing is that you do have to crack the claw yourself and that got a bit messy. They should probably hand out wet naps just in case for the people like me that don't like to waste food. For dessert we ordered the coconut panna cotta (husband ordered it)....definitely not the best dessert, but I did like the mango and lil almond crispies or whatever it was on top.  Overall, service was very attentive and food was good. For all that food plus a soft drink and a beer, it was about 200 bucks so be prepared to spend some money for the good stuff! I know we will be putting the Barrymore into the rotation. =)",

    "text": "This was the surprise place of choice for my birthday dinner this year! My boyfriend did good.   When finding the location, just look out for the Royal Resort. The restaurant is connected to the hotel and tucked on the left hand side (when facing it). When I first arrived I couldn't help but get instantly excited with the all-around ambiance of the restaurant. I'm a sucker for boutique-type restaurants and The Barrymore was just that. Dark velvet booths, low dim lighting, damask patterned wallpaper, with some vintage furnishing. Imagine old Hollywood clashing with modern couture. They had a singer who would come around to tables to see a quick little something, and give a birthday shout out. Here comes the star knocker...apparently my boyfriend had put in a special request with the singer and paid him extra just to come by our table and sing a Beatles song. Sadly it never happened. Such a shame because that would've given my man like 100 brownie points.   We started off with the lobster mac & cheese, of course. I'd have to say it was THE BEST lobster mac & cheese I've ever had. I'm not the biggest fan of this dish in general since it's always so rich and heavy on the cream, but it was definitely exceptional at The Barrymore. The flavor was rich with a strong taste of lobster bisque. There was a generous amount of lobster in it and although it was heavy on the cream, it was most definitely very enjoyable. I literally had to take a second to compose myself just now, because my mouth instantly starting salivating and I'm beginning to drool.   For the main course I went with the sea bass. Most places overcook the fish with the fear of it being undercooked, but it was cooked to perfection. It was accompanied with some green beans and cauliflower, both very good as well. But in all honesty, just go straight for the duck. That was what the BF ordered. I secretly wanted to trade but I do that at almost every meal, and asking him to trade his duck for my fish would be too cruel. As side items, I ordered the cream corn. Skip it. It was bland and not as enjoyable as I'd hope for. We also ordered the mushrooms, carrots, and mash potatoes as other side items. All decent, nothing to really rave about.  As a send-off, we were given mini macaroons which were decent, but I really appreciated the gesture. Other than that, I don't have much to say about the service. It wasn't bad at all, not anything out of the ordinary worth mentioning.  Overall, I really enjoyed my birthday dinner at The Barrymore. If I had a Beatles song sung to me, it would've truly been as good as it gets!",

    "text": "I know it's trite, but it's True: this is a hidden gem. I was searching for foie gras (California refugee), and came across the Yelp listing for The Barrymore. I would never have found the place without Yelp- it's tucked in the side of the lobby of an older hotel, barely a block off the north end of the strip. Quite honestly, the place reminded me of the Hollywood Tower of Terror at Disney's California Adventure-- if Disney decides to theme a restaurant there (like Blue Bayou at Pirates), this could be their model!  The dining room is quiet and small, with mid-century decor. Gilded film reels across the ceiling and flocked wall paper complete the time-warp feeling. I eat early when I'm solo- so possibly I missed the rush later, but the room was quiet for a Saturday night. Despite this, the service was spot on- not hurried, not absent- very attentive and informative.   I had a good feeling about dinner when a basket of three warm breads arrived. There was a slice of cracker bread, a beautiful mini epis and a small pretzel bread.   There is a long list of starters, which did not study, as I knew I'd pick the seared foie gras! The plating was interesting- the slice (warm and perfectly seared) was served on a chunk of sherry bread pudding with a caramelized fig. The dish was finished with micro-greens and a drizzle of sauce. The combination was great- especially for someone who has missed this artisan product (btw- give up your factory chickens and eggs before you complain to me about hand raised foie gras ducks...). Try the house special cocktail- The Barrymore- with the foie gras-- a great combination!  I had the seared diver scallops on creamed corn with pesto, and could not resist ordering the corn with bacon and lobster as a side. Yes, it was a bit too much corn, but every bite was delicious.   I am not generally a dessert eater, but the kitchen sent me a beautiful chocolate-raspberry tartlet with a scoop of pistachio ice cream-- the crust was impossibly tender, and the chocolate ganache was delicious.   I'm looking forward to my next visit! I've been to many of the upscale restaurants on the strip- and I have to say this ranks among the best for original and delicious food, and without the snobbery that must sometimes be suffered to enjoy the food!",

While the wine was not the most expensive, we refilled our glasses the entire meal. I'd say the same for the bottled water we ordered. But it was off to the side where we could not reach it. Our plates also sat on front of us for some time. And my short rib was just ok compared to many other places I've been. After paying $300 plus a 20% tip (for bad service) I definitely won't return.",

It's going to be the next big thing on the Vegas restaurant scene and with very few tables, once the word gets out this restaurant will be extremely difficult to get into very very soon. The restaurant officially opens on September 17th, but right now they are having what they call in the biz a \"soft opening.\" The Barrymore is located in the lobby of the Royal Resort, it is the perfect compliment to the cool and hip vibe that the Royal House lounge has presented us with this year.    The decor of the Barrymore is phenomenally beautiful and everything from the food to the service is top notch (a big shout out to our server Israel who is amAAAzing at what he does)! We had the lobster mac and cheese, the lobster deviled eggs, tuna nicoise salad, the burger and for dessert, drum roll please.... the best freaking s'mores EVER MADE!!!  Every single dish was a flavor quest in my mouth and I think this place may have spoiled me forever! Also quick tip: try their signature cocktail The Barrymore, it's got orange marmalade in it and the $7 glass of prosecco ain't too shabby either! All in all The Barrymore is a carefully crafted experience that will delight and surprise you at every turn!",

    "text": "*4.5 stars*  The Barrymore is an awesome wolf dressed fully in a dirty sheep's clothing. How is it possible that such an amazing steakhouse exists in such a cheap-looking hotel? Maybe that's what makes it that much more appealing to me.  When we pulled up to the hotel, I was worried about the decision I've made to eat here. Damn, we're going to waste a dinner. Life moment #1738 of: \"Never judge a book by its cover.\" Once you're inside the restaurant, all of my worries dissipated instantly. The Barrymore is dark and classy -- it reminds of a 40's Hollywood jazz club.   ----------------------- FOOD: (Best to worst)  Bone-In Ribeye = This is one of the best slabs of ribeye I've EVER had in life. Perfectly cooked, fantastically seasoned, and juicy as all hell. Everything about this steak was perfection.  Bacon Bread = Addictive as all hell. Powerful bacon oil just bursting out of each bite.  Lobster Mac & Cheese = Overly oily and cheesy, but damn was it good. I could only have a few bites, but those bites were wondrous.  Seared foie gras = I love foie gras, but this foie gras could've been seared better. But, I mean, it's still foie gras, so I still loved each bite.  Lobster Creamed Corn = The creamed corn was good, but nothing great. -----------------------  If you want to skip all of the extremely expensive, big-name restaurants strewn throughout the Vegas strip, and go with a decently-priced, but phenomenal steakhouse, look no further than The Barrymore.",

    "text": "I'd give it a 3.5. We were supposed to go to another restaurant but at the last minute were able to get a reservation at the Barrymore, so we decided to give it a shot. It's off the strip and in a very random location--in some sort of motel that looks kind of sketchy. Getting out of the car I had my reservations, but when we walked in I relaxed a bit.  Definitely has an old school vibe, and it's True that it reminds you of \"mad men\" times. Unfortunately the food didn't quite live up to the ambiance. I started with grilled octopus, which was a bit slimy and didn't have a ton of flavor. For dinner I had a sea bass which was good, but nothing spectacular. All in all, I'd stay on the strip and go to the higher rated places there; this place just wasn't worth the trek.",

It is off the strip in an old school Vegas hotel so if you are towards the Mandalay Bay side of the strip, it is quite a hike to get there.   The restaurant and bar are really, really well done. There is a beautiful patio and the interior is very posh and 50s inspired. We sat at the bar and started dinner with a caesar salad and their version of a wedge. The ceasar was okay, nothing to write home about. The wedge was spectacularly delicious. It almost tasted like a big mac with the russian dressing but so much better. Really unique and really great.    For our entrees we had an amazing chicken dish that might have been the best chicken I have ever had and  a wild boar bolognese which fell pretty flat especially when compared to the chicken.   Overall, great experience and I would definitely go back!",

That was just the beginning...later I came to realize that he Falsely promised us to waive the corkage fee for the wine that my party had brought if we were to order the dessert wine. As dinner progressed the service regressed. The waiter and manager started be more short and rude, the food was mediocre and overpriced and it's just a big scam. We were all here for a birthday party and this place managed to upset all 13 guests. For a place that charges 1400 for dinner you would expect a little more hospitality. I have received better service at McDonald's than this place, no wonder why it's off of the strip in an unmarked location. I want my one star back!",

Our waiter comp'd us a dessert since it was our first visit which was very nice. I think we had the creme brulee. I remember loving it. The manager approached our table and inquired about our visit.

The decor is very cool and reminded me of what I thought Vegas must have been like in the 60's. It was a great alternative to some of the cheesiness of the strip.    Our waiter was very friendly and funny. He cracked us up a bunch of times during the meal but was always professional and attentive.   Food was delicious. I had never had sweetbreads before and our waiter told me all about them and encouraged me to try them... and I am glad he did. They were delicious. I then was served what was possibly the most mouth watering steak I have ever had. Cooked absolutely perfectly medium rare. I asked the waiter for a wine recommendation and it paired perfectly. I was too stuffed to eat a dessert.   I'd recommend this place if you are on he north end of the Strip.",

    "text": "Food, service, ambiance... if you add them up, the barrymore comes out to a perfect 5.    My wedding hairstylist recommended the Barrymore to me.  Her husband is a chef, as is mine.  We were getting married in Vegas and wanted the night after the wedding to be an intimate date, away from the 100 loved ones who flew out to celebrate our nuptials....  so the barrymore it was!  Initially, it was going to be just my fussy chef of a groom and me... alas, one of his chef friends and his girlfriend were still in town, and looked longfully at us as we described our plans of eating things I don't normally eat... so a party of five it was.  The place is amazing.  I don't understand why people have negative things to say about the Royal Resort.  Sure, it's not the Four Seasons or the Wynn, but it's the height of re-done art deco miami coziness.  I loved the lobby, the lighting and the mirrors strung artfully on the wall.  What a great space!  I would totally stay there.  The restaurant is as folks described - classy, sexy, a beautiful version of what we dream old Vegas was.  Our waiter was nice and helpful.  We ordered cocktails.  We all enjoyed them.  And then.... the food!  We ordered so much... Octopus (the first time I enjoyed octopus!) was tender not chewy, perfectly seasoned... yum.  Watermelon and heirloom tomato salad was a hit - we loved the candied rind.  Veal sweetbreads?  I will ignore what they are and savor each delicious bite.  The pastry with the foie gras was a bit sweet for me, but as a combination, it was amazing!  the vegetarian pasta dish was delicate and understated.  The clams were a bit chewy, but the pepper sauce was great.  The vegetable cous cous dish was probably the only dish that we didn't like too much - it was a bit boring.  While everything else was special and unique, this was ordinary.  Next up were the two entrees that we shared.... were we still hungry?  Not at all.  Does that stop chefs from tasting everything?  Not at all.  We shared the duck two ways and the short rib.  The duck was good, the short rib was EXCELLENT.  Perhaps the best I've ever eaten.  I want another one!  We were too full for dessert, but our fabulous waiter brought us a celebratory creme brulee.  Tasty.  While we like to try different restaurants when in Vegas, we have found one that we'll be back to again and again.",

Delicious. An amuse and bread arrived that was a very tasty as well.  We shared  French Onion Soup next and both of us agreed it was very good. Just the right amount of onions.  For the main course, I had the filet with bordelaise sauce and she had the diver scallops... we shared 1.5 lbs of main lobster.   NOM NOM! 5 star! we were so stuffed we skipped dessert.

    "text": "I went here this past Friday to celebrate a friend's birthday, and I'm glad I did!   The Barrymore is a beautiful little restaurant hidden inside a very sketchy Hotel right off the Vegas Strip. As I walked up to the front door I was a little nervous because I saw the typical douchey Vegas tourists in their flip flops, Tommy Bahama shirts, and golfing shorts..This is a FANCY restaurant..Try to have some class, this isn't Fremont or The Circus Circus Buffet.    We made it in time for our 7:30 reservation, but had to wait,  we sat at the bar and ordered a few drinks and looked around in awe..  Beautiful art works, old Hollywood Glamour furnishings..I felt like I had gone back in time..A time before Ed Hardy, Tommy Bahama, and Tapout... After we waited for a while I finally went back to the hostess stand, and found out that she gave our table away. The VERY TALL manager overheard and promptly bought us a round of drinks for our patience. He made sure that we were happy and well taken care of, especially hearing that we were locals.  I just moved here from L.A. where a manager wouldn't give to shits about giving away your table, so this all came as a shock to me.  We finally sit at our table, I can't stop thinking about how utterly gorgeous everything was..    O.K.  FOOD!..  We ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese ( who wouldn't?! )   It was creamy,rich, and mouthwatering.. I also ordered the kale salad which was also good..but I actually love the Winter Kale Salad @Culinary Dropout 1000 times better..My friends all loved their main courses..but I ordered the Chicken, which seemed like an after thought..it wasn't good..  It was VERY dry and flavourless.  I am looking forward to revisiting The Barrymore, but I will  definitely be getting a different entree or maybe just order two bowls of the Lobster Mac and Cheese. :)  So visit The Barrymore, but please don't dress like a tacky tourist!",

A few of us came here and ordered the following:  Half dozen of oysters on half shell  - forgot where they were from. Endive and green apple  salad Filet mignon 8oz + Foie gras medallion NY strip steak 14 oz Lobster tail with butter Lobster mac & cheese  As a starter the seasonal oysters and endive apple salad were very refreshing and appetizing.  Being from California the restaurants are banned from serving foie gras so I had to order it when opportunity presents itself and I was not disappointed. The portion of the foie gras was substantial and the filet was ultra-tender.  Everything we had ordered was simply delightful and delicious. I would definitely return.",

They have a sitting area outside with a fire pit in the back ground very cool. We got there early and to our surprise they have a happy hour daily with some delicious appetizers and good drinks. When we walked inside the actual restaurant the ceiling was covered with movie film holders (not sure of the name) but it gave it a classy touch. Our waiter Luis was very helpful and friendly he took the time to go over their specials and gave us enough time to look over the menu since it was a large party. The menu is A la carte and they have a lot of side dishes to choose from. I ordered the Shrimp scampi and it was super tasty.  Most of the people in my party ordered steaks and they loved it. My husband said it was on his top restaurant list for steak. If you want a relaxing or romantic dinner I would recommend this place.",

Inside of the Royal Resort to your left you will find a place that pleases people who appreciate the old glam of Las Vegas or Hollywood. The walls are beautiful covered in a white and black damask. The chandeliers are grand and set the mood just right. Cory took our beverage order and he was patient and helpful suggesting wonderful cocktails. I recommend the Sazerac. It was perfect! We went outside and there seems to be fire along the wall and a cute lounge area that is very intimate. There was also a singer with a smooth voice who did a twist on Bob Marleys \"Is this love\". I really enjoyed everything about this place and would definitely return.",

Stephanie our bartender/waitress took very good care of us and even offered some suggestions for our dinner selections. The grilled octopus was cooked perfectly. Wagu was amazing and the short ribs fell off the bone. Sides that we loved were the creamed corn with lobster, brussel sprouts, mushrooms and grilled asparagus. The meal finished with carrot cake bread pudding and and fun presentation on the smoked chocolate tart...a must see! I highly recommend getting off the strip and making a reservation for The Barrymore...an amazing steak house",

This place exceeded our expectations. The cocktails  and the breadbasket were awesome. When our appetizers arrived we were not disappointed. The grilled octopus was presented beautifully and the fois gras was divine. Our entrees where also on point. The Dry aged Rib eye was grilled perfectly. The duck was also cooked perfectly.

When we walked in, the hostess quickly greeted us and showed us to our table. Our server was great and offered some recommendations. I went for the free range chicken, while my guests opted for the steak. The chicken was a lot better than I expected. The skin was slightly crisp and the meat was moist. The steaks were cooked perfectly as request. I sampled a few bites and it was pretty good. Not the best that I've had, but comparable to some of the other popular steakhouses. I also tried their famous lobster mac and cheese, kind of disappointing. It was just ok. Caesar salad and sides were average as well.   All things considered, I'd give this place a 3.5.",

Bar had a singer who was a little loud for the small bar, but perfect for dining room patrons next door (her voice carried over nicely -not too loud). Service was prompt without being rushed. The menu, while limited was nicely prepared. I had the rack of lamb which was very well presented. Overall, I'd come back again; not one of my top 5 places in Vegas, but it's a top 15 for me (I've enjoyed 30 steakhouses in Vegas in the last 8 years).",

The Barrymore cocktail was delicious as well as everyone else's plates I took a bite from including: the roasted duck special, scallops and oxtail, and a perfectly textured steak! Thanks guys :)",

The hotel that the restaurant resides in looks old but you shouldn't judge a restaurant by the hotel it sits in.   We ordered the lobster mac and cheese and was the best item of the night.  Lots of cheese, pasta that wasn't overly cooked and big lobster chunks.  The Foie gras had a nice sear and cooked well but I thought the peach that came with it was overly sweet.  The brussels sprouts were just okay.",

I was very surprised when I pulled it up on Yelp and saw the great ratings, based off of where it was I was expecting a dump.  The hotel it is in is definitely interesting.    When I walked in the door, I was amazingly impressed.  I was sad we only were having drinks to meet up my friend.  Next time I am definitely going to bring my buddies to eat here.  Of the large group I came to Vegas with, 2 of my buddies joined me.    We all ordered specialty drinks.  They were all incredible.  Although I did not eat, because we had reservations at another place, the food that walked by looked and smelled outstanding.    This is a great hidden gem of Vegas, definitely check it out!",

If someone wouldn't have told me about this place on Convention Center Drive I would have never found it. Like so many other reviews comment here \" don't judge a book by it's cover\" . The atmosphere was small and intimate. They had a picture frame that played old movies on it, what a cute idea!!  I went here on Valentine's Day, it was busy for them I guess. It took a while to get my food but, when I got it it was totally worth it! I ordered the the Moroccan shank lamb ( lots of meat here) corn lobster ( this was to die for ) & mushrooms. We had the lobster mac & cheese appetizer to share. This is a very popular item at the Barrymore so I had to try it. Totally worth it!  The sides are large enough for two people to share by the way. If you check-in at the Barrymore on Yelp and show your waiter/waitress that you checked in you can get a free glass of wine.  We took advantage of this offer.  Now my boyfriends meal unfortunately was a whole different story. He ordered some type of steak. I am not a steak person so don't recall the type. It had to be sent back twice because it was not cooked enough :( . The poor waitress felt so bad, & my meal was perfect what do you do?  Well, they did give us a $20 discount on the meal for the trouble . I personally think giving him his meal free would have been one step better since I was completely done with my meal by the time I he got his complete dinner. I would still go back because I enjoyed myself and my meal was great.",

My wife and I only go there for happy hour (we're not big steak eaters) and order appetizers at half price. Now not only are all of our favorites off the happy hour menu, but it's a weird new, not so great selection.  Guess what? Salty short rib on a salty pretzel bun = salt sandwich. Not that great of a combo. We've officially given up on this place as a happy hour hang out. We really wanted this to work out. Maybe we'll be back in Winter for the boar pasta.",

I have a feeling it's popularity was just taking away from the rest of their incredible menu.  The pork belly is also no longer on the dinner menu, but there are some new items that have surfaced, including one of the best duck entrees I have ever had. Again, everything on the menu is at a price point that is right in line with the quality. But, not to worry for all of the die hard fans of the burger. I was there recently and asked about the burger, and our server said. \"I think the chef wouldn't mind cooking one up for a special request.\" My suggestions: Softshell crab and grilled octopus appetizers, The duck, Whatever is the daily special, and a side of the bacon and lobster mac and cheese.",

    "text": "Great restaurant in Las Vegas. My steak was cooked perfectly, and the house-made sauces really brought out the flavor of the beef. The wine list was phenomenal. All of the sides were done well, including one that I would almost NEVER get, the brussel sprouts - delicious.   Service was a solid B+. Our server was extremely formal in dress, demeanor, and verbiage, which I welcome - but maybe it was even a bit robotic for me. I love fine dining restaurants, but when I can't really connect to the server because the service feels forced, it becomes less desirable; and borderline uncomfortable.  The hotel that this restaurant is in was a serious turn off. It's an old, dusty, cheesy hotel. If you're coming here for a special occasion, I feel that some of the specialness may be lost when having to leave your car in the sad parking lot of the Royal Resort. Luckily, the interior of the restaurant is beautiful. Dark, comfortable, and romantic; with high booths and light background music for privacy. It really didn't match. I feel that the clientele of the hotel and the clientele of the restaurant would almost never overlap. Move this into the City Center, and that would be much more fitting.  Meal was between $150 and $200 for two of us, so it was more Strip-level pricing. Not sure if that makes a lot of sense to me. It felt a little overpriced due to the okay service and less-than-ideal location.   60/40 chance of me revisiting.. But the steak was amazing.",

Restaurant was hidden just off the strip in a random hotel.   On to the food... Appetizers were on the small side. Foie gras was tiny but tasty. I got the aged bone in filet which was awesome. My main complaint is that I felt a bit cheated. Waiter presented the filet as their special of the night but didn't disclose that they would charge you for all of the toppings.  By the time I got the bill I was surprised that I paid 85 dollars for a steak. 65 for the steak 17 for a topping and 3 dollars for some sauce on the steak. I don't mind paying for a good piece of steak but didn't appreciate the dishonesty. Don't get dooped on the special like me!   Three star but I rated it two too offset all the False reviews.",

Our bill came out to around $150 for 2 people, which really isn't bad compared to other gourmet cuisine in vegas. Although, I have to admit it was delicious but not my favorite food.  Firstly, they tell you the breads you're eating which made me really happy and I have to say they were all good. In specific, BACON BREAD (with raisins) was SO good, not to mention the parmesan bread and baguette were also really fresh.   To start, we ordered Lobster Macaroni and French Onion Soup. Both were good but not outstanding. I can make better macaroni :(  Where the food stood out was the entrees. The duck confit was delicious, as were my scallops! The scallops were really fresh.  I would definitely go back, and just avoid ordering the mediocre appetizers. The service was impeccable (perhaps because I was there on a thursday night).",

We split the roasted artichoke, the halibut with pesto and the fava bean gnocchi as a side dish.  Topped it off with the creme brulee on the patio.  Drinks included the cherry picker, Pom star martini and a cucumber concoction that were just stupendous.  This is the first of two nights in Vegas and we are thinking of returning tomorrow night.   The ambiance is so unique, comfortable and relaxing.",

    "text": "LOVED this place. I actually found it because I yelp'd from my iPhone when a  nearby restaurant's wait was too long for my liking on a Friday night. I called The Barrymore and the receptionist said there was a slight wait, but took my reservation and applied my drive time to my reservation. I was already sold. By the time I showed up, my girlfriend and I were immediately seated at a cute little table for two with a view of the fire-pit and patio outside. As soon as our glasses of wine were brought out, the GM approached our table and whisked us away to the back room and asked if we would be more comfortable enjoying our meal there. It was like our already 5-star experience got upgraded to a 6-star experience. The decor is old-Hollywood glam (me and my red lipstick fit right in), the lobster mac was out-of-this-world, and the chef CUT OUR STEAK UP FOR US! I've represented several high-end restaurants in Houston, and I've never experienced that type of service. AMAZING. We felt like princesses, and in fact, our waiter told us we should be treated like princesses when my friend attempted to place her own napkin in her lap, and he insisted that's why he was there --as he placed her napkin in her lap--- to wait on us hand and foot. The whole experience was straight out of a movie!  We had such a great dining experience, we decided to extend our stay for a cocktail at the bar. The bartenders were so friendly and even explained the history of the Barrymores' glass sign by the bar (I'll let you ask...such a cool little story). I've lived here for a year now, and this is officially my go-to resto to bring any family members, clients and friends who are in town!",

We shared a bottle of wine as our appetizer (ha!) For our entrees, we each had a steak with a side of mashed potatoes and the lobster mac & cheese.  It was all AMAZING!  The steaks were cooked to perfection.  I wish we had more time to try dessert, but we had tickets for a show afterwards.  If I had to pick at something, the location is definitely off the beaten path - although that can be a plus to some people.  The other thing that was a little irritating is that we had about 4 different servers/sommelier/GM ask us if we decided what we wanted to drink.  We kept having to tell people that we were still looking over the menu, but cant fault them too much for being thorough.",

Good complimentary bread was served, including excellent just salted enough Pretzel Bread.  A Shrimp Cocktail was relatively large and meaty but not sweet at all.  Lobster Mac & Cheese and an Iceberg Wedge were good but not that memorable.    My entree of Pan Roasted Free Range Chicken with Fingerling Potatoes, Fava Beans, and Foraged Mushrooms featured very good, moist chicken with fine Chicken Jus to meld all components on the plate well together.  Milk Chocolate Layer Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream and Dark Chocolate Sauce was a nice way to close the meal.  It was very dark inside the dining room closest to the hotel entrance, and service was relatively slow.  * * * 1/2 overall on this particular visit!",

Honestly think it was the best meal we have  ever had!  Started with an off menu special of scallops for an appetizer.  They were huge, seared perfectly and served atop deep fried green beans and a romesco sauce.  We got 3, and wish we would have ordered 30!  Would have been happy with just those for a meal but we also each got a steak.  I got the filet with mushrooms and a bordelaise sauce. My wife got a dry aged bone in ribeye.  Could not have been better quality, more flavorful or prepared any better.  For a side we shared the brussel sprouts with bacon.  At first glance they looked a little over charred but that was not present in the taste at all. They were cooked perfectly and the chunky bacon gave the right amount of smoke.  Would highly recommend.  Wish we had more time/room for dessert, so cant report on that.  This place is between the main strip hotels and the stratosphere hotel, just off the strip in a hotel we had never heard of.  So truly a hidden gem with a great old school ambience to it.  Service was truly a team effort and we never were left waiting.  Wish they were closer to milwaukee!",

The foie gras ($24) wasn't on the Social Hour menu, but they did have bone marrow ($8) and oysters rockefeller ($9) on there. Seriously, what a steal! Everything tasted delicious and the prices were more than reasonable. The restaurant itself is very old Hollywood and there was even a singer serenading us with classical songs.

A co-worker of mine had recommended this place to me prior but I was a tad skeptical because of the location however all my doubts washed away as soon as we stepped inside the Royal Resort's front doors. The Barrymore is the definition of a \"hole-in-the-wall\" with a rough exterior and a gorgeous high-end dressed interior.  Because of LVRW, we had pre-set menus but even still everything was breath-taking from the service to the presentation and most definitely the flavor. I had the $80++ pre-set with the Smoked Bacon, Dean Martin, and Chocolate Layer Cake; while my friend had the $50++ pre-set with the Escargot, Wagyu Flat Iron, and the Pistachio-Vanilla Bean Swirl Creme Brulee. We shared most of the food family style as well as ordered off-menu to grab a Lobster Mac and Cheese Appetizer (We're huge suckers for cheese). Everything from the selection of artisan breads to the free wine at check-in left us shedding a few imaginary tears. Even our sommelier was beyond wonderful, making sure all of our courses were paired with the right balance of flavors to enhance our experience to the fullest.  My ace-in-the-hole was without a doubt the Smoked Bacon though, a thick cut of perfectly honey glazed bacon served over a bed of caramelized onions and oven-baked bread (When they tell you that the thicker the better they are really not lying). The memory of such flavors is making my mouth water all over again.  Overall I would definitely come back again to try their traditional menus items, especially the Braised Short Rib; just remember to make a reservation for larger parties since their dining room is quite small.",

Located just north of The Wynn/Encore properties, The Barrymore is worth the Uber or cab for a great dinner and great service. Check in on Yelp and receive a free glass of wine! I did. It was delicious.   1 caesar salad, 2 Steaks, fries, baked potato & a breadbasket later, we 2 patrons were STUFFED AND HAPPY. The waitstaff was attentive and got everything 100% correct and then some. The dining room was beautiful and quiet, a nice break from the woo-woo of Vegas noise without the pretentious price tag.",

    "text": "I dined at the Barrymore for my birthday and I cannot praise this restaurant enough. I love the intimate setting, large U-shaped booths, film reels upon the ceiling and mirrors hanging on the walls.  It was nice seeing the wait staff run their own food, check on their tables and pre-bus all of the dishes. This is not as common anymore in Vegas, particularly near the strip, and I appreciated knowing that my tip was going directly to the very deserving wait staff.  We started off our feast with the chilled seafood platter and roasted bone marrow. The bone marrow was as delicious as this meat butter always is and the pickled vegetables cut through the fattiness. The seafood platter was to die for; the lobster was cooked perfectly, the crab claws were incredibly sweet, the Washington oysters were fresh with that iodine flavor of PNW oysters and the prawns were massive. The only thing that left something to be desired was the tuna poke. I could have lived without and it seemed like an odd menu choice for this restaurant.  For our second courses we had the short rib, the chilean sea bass and the shrimp scampi with asparagus and corn with lobster to share. The short rib was perfectly decadent, the sea bass seared to perfection and shrimp scampi presented beautifully. The lobster was lost in the corn, due to the smoky bacon flavor, but was still delicious.  For dessert we shared the cheesecake coupe, which was essentially a deconstructed strawberry cheesecake. The hot strawberry sauce was poured over a white chocolate wafer and it melted into the sniffer glass to create the perfect ending to the meal.",

We've been to The Barrymore many times and I just realized I hadn't written them a review, so here goes...  First, the food is amazing! Don't get me started on the lavosh - I could literally eat a basketful. If you've read other reviews of mine, you'd know the bread basket is very important, lol. The grilled octopus is flavorful and cooked to perfection. Some of my favorite entrees are the cioppino, scallops, and sea bass. My husband always enjoys their steak.  Other notes: Service is great, but I do recommend making a reservation. The outdoor patio is a cool spot to enjoy drinks with friends. The area is off the beaten path, so I like that they have valet parking (most nights).  Definitely one of those restaurants that's a must try!",

I feel like its certainly a diamond in the rough, considering the neighborhood. We all enjoyed our meals however my NY strip was ordered charred medium-rare and came out black and blue. It was recooked but appeared to be thrown in a salamander as to not further char the steak, unfortunately it came out rare in the middle, but I ate the edges as to not make a fuss with our guests and enjoyed the leftovers with eggs in the mornin! The manager did stop by the table to do a passive table touch, but I always appreciate direct acknowledgment, I wouldn't have even said it came back rare, or mentioned the secondary prep. But we will be back. Tgis is the only time we've ever had a \"hitch\".",

To my surprise it was only 10 minutes away from our hotel. Driving through the street, I immediately spot the sign out front, illuminating with a fire that matches my hunger.   We walk in, our host greats us and we are seated. We check in and our waiter is more than happy to bring us our free wine. We know just what we want, filet mignon for her and rib eye for me. Both steaks are perfectly cooked, juicy, very flavorful and are slightly bigger than you usually find at a nice steakhouse. The mashed potatoes were amazingly creamy. The complementary bread was almost as good as the steak, I had to stop myself from eating any more of the pretzel bread.   I'm somewhat of a newcomer to the steakhouse scene, but after having dined at some pretty fancy steakhouses in Chicago and Los Angeles, The Barrymore will still be one of my favorites.",

Nice selection of seafood options to go with Wet and Dry aged steak offerings. We started off with a nice bread basket and my guest and I shared the 14oz NY Strip (wet aged) - prepared perfectly - juicy inside (they were kind enough to slice it for us) - nice light char on the outside - seasoned perfectly! We also had the shrimp scampi and shared grilled asparagus and roasted Brussel sprouts (as with most restaurants - side dishes are good for 2 guests to share). Everything was great. We tried their version of ice cream sundae - which had 3 scoops of different flavored ice creams and then you are provided with different toppings you can add such as pistachios, chocolate & caramel sauces and a few others. They also have a nice wine selection and Heidi the Manager/Sommelier will help you pick out some great options and make sure you have a great experience. The dining area is not that large so if you're looking for something unique or maybe with an 'intimate' atmosphere - check it out! They also have full service bar/lounge I believe with occasional live music. Don't miss out on this hidden gem!",

    "text": "4.5. Went twice in two days w/party of four; 5 star first time, 4 the second. Look, this is a steak restaurant. Don't come here for fish or vegetarian food; don't waste your $$$. We came for steak and foie gras, and seeing sweetbreads on the menu was a big bonus point. There are two dining rooms: you want the nicer, club-like one with semi-circular plush booths along the walls. The other is bland and opens off the bar, making it noisy. The waiter was also better the first night, altho waitstaff outside the SF Bay Area is almost always a level higher in training and professionalism.  We skipped the specials, which are priced very high, and stayed with basic steak. Good steak doesn't need sauces, either, so we skipped those too. We liked very much:  - Seared Foie Gras with Quince and Almonds. We love foie gras, and La Folie/SF used to make it best. This wasn't up to LF, but it was very good and cooked perfectly. Good size, too. No complaints, outside of the quince being slightly oversweetened.  - Sweetbreads: Served with sweet glazed onion shreds, arugula microgreens, and a lovely breaded and fried potato parsnip croquette. There was no real sauce with the sweetbreads, just a bit of au jus, and it was delightful. A great rebuke to SF Bay Area chefs who think sweetbreads always need battering and deep-frying to be acceptable - NOT!  - Endive and Green Apple Salad. Would have liked a bit more gorgonzola but I loved the refreshing bitterness after the two rich starters. Probably big enough to share; I had this as my entree.  - Crispy Pork Belly: served with a blue cheese mousse and root veggies. Excellent. Wiped the plate clean.  - Creamed Corn w/Lobster; also the Roasted Brussels Sprouts. Both excellent. Nice to see the sprouts cooked first, THEN grilled. That way they don't have to be cooked into charcoal to be edible.   - 8-oz Filet. This was filet of rib-eye the first night but filet mignon the second. The rib-eye is always better, but both were perfectly cooked and delicious. Yes, meat needs to be salted to taste good, something CA cooks seem to have forgotten.  - Bread pudding. The dessert of choice, far better than the others. Very soft, great with coffee.  Good not great: - 14-oz NY strip. I am not a NY strip fan, with beef getting so lean these days. Our friends split this, but they agreed the filet was much better and switched on the second night. It is okay, but not as thick as the filet so the pre-salting came off a bit heavy-handed.  - Chocolate Pear Tart and Caramel Apple Cheesecake. Good, but they tasted like commercial desserts, not really special but an okay way to end a meal.  Don't order: - Octopus. It was a huge portion; very tender but uninteresting. Octopus really needs the kiss of smoke to add some umami; this came off like imitation Spanish food for wimps. It needed to be bolder and better flavored; the piquillos were fine but there was no pimenton. The gigante beans were undercooked slightly.",

    "text": "I am glad that I chose this restaurant for my wedding dinner but on the other hand I am disappointed. I never been there before but decided to trust my intuition and reviews. I love that the restaurant was empty by the time we came and we didn't have to rent it. It was Sunday. The interior design is beautiful and matched my old Hollywood theme. The menu was great. Service was good. Food was average. None of the guests were impressed that's for sure. Cocktails were bit disappointed for those who is not a fan of old fashioned ones. It felt they were more for gentlemen than for ladies. But bartender created for ladies a special cocktail which was perfect. Desserts were ordered in advance and looked fine matched the style but they didn't taste good at all. Maybe I am too spoiled but guests would eat the cake if it was tasty. Nobody touch it when they tried one spoon as it was plain with lack of berries. We had to give away to some people who needed it.. Cupcakes were not touched as they were not tasty according to the guests. The killers were chocolate macaroons. They were outstanding and eaten on the spot together with the white chocolate truffles.  I am such a foodie and very upset that food itself was not on the right level for the wedding dinner even though service was good and place itself was fantastic. I loved the flower arrangement it was perfect and beautiful. Communicating with managers were ok but nobody even asked how was the wedding dinner. Still upset with the desserts as I am a queen of delicious sophisticated desserts but at least it looked fine and matched the theme..",

    "text": "The food was good. The waiter was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. My guest and I sampled each other's meals and enjoyed everything except the asparagus (quite plain and too crunchy). The surf and turf was very good, but the cheese that the waiter said would melt down over the steak when I cut into the pastry did not do so, it was re-solidified by the time it got to me at the table. The wedge salad and beet salad were both good, not extraordinary, but certainly good. The sea bass (that I was so excited about) was smooth in some spots, but had a bit of a chewy texture in some other places. It wasn't overly flavorful - perhaps it needs more garlic and butter? The sauteed mushrooms were nicely done and had a good flavor. The Pistachio crime brulee was done very well - solid sugar coating, very creamy, even texture. The Oscar fries were one of the favorites at the table. I'm honestly not sure how I feel about the fries being the best part of a $150 meal. My guest and I went there with a group and some of them were surprised by the $7 charge for a glass of water. So just be prepared, if you don't understand water terminology before you go, look up the terms \"sparkling, still, and regular\" so that you know what you're getting. (BTW, regular water is free.) I did feel that the lounge music was way too loud for the intimate environment, but the singer had a nice voice and looked quite beautiful.",

Everyone was very attentive. I love their wide variety of wines. Their handcrafted cocktails list was awesome too. My husband went for the One Fall Evening. It was perfect. The food was delicious and the presentation was exquisite. We ordered the chef's specials for the evening. The hubby went for the Surf and Turf and I got the Surf and Surf. The dessert was amazing too. We chose the salted caramel mousse. To die for. Overall a great experience. The ambiance is nice and intimate, perfect for a romantic evening. Will be back for sure!",

    "text": "Oh Vegas, my second home :). I eat every meal like it's my last one and rage like I'm 21 when I'm here.  Always a good time, never a dull moment.  Unfortunately, The Barrymore was my first negative experience at a restaurant in Vegas.  It's located inside a hotel off the strip that I've never heard of.  I was part of the large party of 14 very unhappy people (see all 1-star reviews below).  It might seem like my friends and I are abusing our power as Yelpers but I rarely write 1-star reviews.  As an elite, I recognize the power of Yelp, it could make or break a business.  My point is that I try to be reasonable, so trust me when I say that The Barrymore isn't worth a trip off the strip.  The location, atmosphere, service, and most importantly food is just not up to Vegas standards.  I'm not going to reiterate my party's experience with their painfully slow and unprofessional service.  You can read all about that in the reviews below.  I'd like to just talk about how ridiculously overpriced and solidly mediocre the food was.  I had the sea bass special.  My dish came with risotto, jumbo prawns, and a lobster tail.  I know it sounds delicious but too bad it wasn't.  The sea bass was unseasoned and sat on a bed of oversalted pea risotto.  The prawns were big but were dry and flavorless.  Same with the lobster tail - dry, rubbery and flavorless. The only ingredient that tasted fresh in this dish was the sea bass.  I tried their Kobe flat iron steak and yet again it was unseasoned and bland bland bland.  It was not juicy, just a sad-looking, flavorless piece of steak on a plate.  I tried my friend's Brussels sprouts with bacon and I didn't even taste the bacon, it just tasted like oil.  By the time the lobster mac came around to me I already lost my appetite so I didn't try it.  I never turn food down so the fact that I willingly chose to skip on eating lobster mac n cheese just tells you how bad it was.  Not only was the food disappointing but so was the service.  There are just too many great restaurants in Vegas to even consider this one.  I forgot to mention that my dish was $80 and the steak was around that price range also.  What a waste, I would've had a much better time spending that at the craps table.",

Steakhouse quality dry aged meat being served, like the 18oz Bone-in Ribeye that I destroyed! Even more delicious than it looks! It was cooked perfectly, with a nice char and rub. Fat was very tender and flavorful...great steak! And yes, it rivals some of the better steakhouses in Vegas at a much cheaper price!  They also had Pan Seared Foie Gras, which is served with Peach Cobbler, Candied Pecans & Creme Anglaise. This was great! Good portion on the foie gras with tons of flavor, and it paired perfectly with the sweetness of the peach cobbler! One of the better ways I've had this staple :P   The Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Lobster Cream Corn were good, but missing the lobster taste and chunks I've seen elsewhere in town.  Still good, but wish there was a bit more esp at the price point of the Mac ($16).  Heard they have a great burger here, so I know I will be back to give it a go!  If it is anything like the steaks, I am sure it will be very tasty.  The setting is intimate and romantic as well! Don't judge this book by the outside known as the Royal Resort...it's worth the trip!  Check out the pics...they make my mouth water :",

    "text": "My girlfriend chose the Barrymore for her birthday celebration given the great reviews and promise of a fine dining experience. Once arriving in Vegas, we got ready and excitedly headed to the Barrymore for dinner.  Daniel introduced himself as our server. One of the 13 guests handed him a bottle of wine that he had purchased in celebration of our friend's birthday. Daniel offered to waive the $35 corkage fee with the purchase of a bottle of champagne. We chose a Rose, toasted the birthday girl, and began to order.  Let me start by saying that my favorite food is steak and baked potato. Daniel had told us they were a steakhouse known for their delicious steaks and seafood. The menu to my last supper would definitely include a rib-eye steak cooked medium rare and a baked potato with all the toppings! Of course when it came time for me to order, this is exactly what I wanted. My friend and I were sharing and she ordered the seafood special which included sea bass and lobster tail. We added a side of Brussels sprouts to keep it healthy.  When the food came out, my mouth was watering. I cut into the steak and it was seemingly cooked just as I had asked. I was met with disappointment when I tasted it and it seemed like a steak I could get from the Outback but double the price. It was simply seasoned as I like it, but it wasn't juicy and flavorful as I had imagined. The seabass was delicious as well as the risotto with green sauce. Simple, cooked well, and tasty. The lobster tail was terrible. It was rubbery and wasn't cooked well. The baked potato was just as disappointing. When I imagine baked potato at a restaurant like this, I get excited at the thought of a loaded fluffy potato with all the toppings! They must have threw \"fine dining\" out of the window because it was presented simply as a potato cut in half from the grocery store. No embellishments, no plating. Just the potato all by it's lonesome. It's friends sour cream, chives, butter and bacon came on the side on a separate plate. It just wasn't appetizing. The Brussels sprouts were oily and overpowered by everything else it was cooked in. All in all, the food was mediocre at best. This means a lot coming from someone who is always on a diet and is looking for a place to splurge and indulge in. I was disappointed.  Everything came out so slowly that we started to get impatient. Daniel brings us the bill instead of offering us dessert. When we asked for the dessert menu (birthday girl gets a free dessert!) Daniel said he didn't offer us dessert since we were in a rush. Really? So we don't even sing happy birthday to the birthday girl?  Once the bill finally comes out, we notice the $35 corkage fee on the bill. We inquire since Daniel told us the champagne would waive the fee. He then gets defensive and replies, \"I said if you got a FEW bottles of champagne I would waive the fee. Not just one bottle.\" We tell him we are upset since he told us otherwise and we ask for the manager.  The manager, Paul, tells us it was impossible for Daniel to have said that since he does not have the power to waive the corkage fee because that's just the way they do things. I have a few problems with this. One, why the heck would Daniel even make such an offer when he doesn't have the power to do so. Two, why wouldn't an exception be made since this is what we were promised? Three, it's not like we were given a free bottle of wine. It was the service of pouring the wine that consisted of the fee. It literally was of no cost to the restaurant!   We then decide that we would take the fee out of Daniel's tip since he clearly didn't deserve one after lying to us and refusing to take responsibility for his words. Paul with his poor management skills and inability to make thirteen customers happy also didn't help. We didn't want to leave a tip at all. Paul then threw in his two cents and states that the gratuity is listed on the menu and that we were required to pay for it since our party was greater than six. Therefore, after the terrible service, an unhappy birthday girl and 12 other angry customers, we are forced to pay tip on a $1400 bill. Seriously, $35 is nothing, especially split by 13 people, but not when we were lied to and tricked into buying a bottle of champagne. Then Paul steps in and says he will try to make us happy. Yet, the $35 corkage fee is still sneakily placed on the bill. Still refusing to tip an exhausting and terrible restaurant experience, we calculate the bill without the tip and ask the waiter to charge our cards accordingly. He then pulls a card at random and tells the owner of the card he will have to charge hundreds extra to make up for the rest of the group. Daniel wanted his tip and took it however he could!  I am appalled by the service at this restaurant. Thanks for nothing, except ruining our first night in Vegas and the birthday girl's dinner over a $35 corkage fee at a \"classy\" restaurant.",

    "text": "You may have heard this story already, but here it is from my perspective.  I say one star, but it was actually five stars. I went with a large group and the service was impeccable. It started from when our server, Daniel, proclaimed that corkage would be waived with the purchase of one bottle, only to charge us anyway. It was an honest mistake he quickly rectified by bringing the birthday girl a slice of cake before then leading us in a rousing rendition of Happy Birthday. And my, what glorious cake it was!  We were ready to forgive; the corkage remained, however. The guilt Daniel felt was evident as he quickly brought his manager, Paul, over to calm the situation. Paul was a fine man who appeased us by listening to our complaints with great patience. He nodded, shook his head, and even adopted a quizzical look once or twice, before telling us 'no' and slinking away. There was literally nothing he could do. I mean, what could he POSSIBLY have done? His  honesty was refreshing and it showed him to be a gentleman of the highest order.  Being the deviants we were, a discussion ensued within the group to withhold the mandatory 20% gratuity that had been added to our check. Paul, with his refined sense of intuition, immediately marched back, grabbed our check, and sacrificed his own moral core by waiving the corkage. It was a grand gesture that was wholly unnecessary -- it made me feel very warm and mushy inside. For a brief moment, I considered clapping him on the back, telling him what a fine chap he was, and purchasing another bottle of Rose from him to uncork for us. Truly, I did not want the moment to end.  By then, we realized we had acted out of line, made a conscientious effort to get ourselves together, and paid. It was then discovered that, because they feared they would lose our tip, (without a word to us) Daniel and Paul had devised a lovely plot to pre-charge the entire amount of the tip to one of our credit cards to save us the trouble of having to approve it ourselves. This was quite considerate of them as it wasn't something I had ever experienced at any other fine establishment I have ever dined at.  All in all, it was a wonderful start to the evening. Thank you, Barrymore. You outdid yourselves. I will tell all my friends about my experience and will definitely be back. A++!!",

    "text": "Went here on a whim after reading some decent reviews.  I was very happy with the overall experience.  Server was very attentive, but not overbearing.  We had two appetizers, two entrees and a couple glasses of wine and the bill was just shy of $100.  It's definitely tucked away and probably won't get the attention it deserves, but a great spot nonetheless.  I thought the food quality was great, portion sizes were spot on - not too large, not too small.  I thought the duck dish was a little salty, but it was also confit...  Anyone who is looking for a nice, quiet place to enjoy some good food, give this place a chance.  Wished the hotel offered valet but parking out back isn't terrible.",

    "text": "I wanted so bad to like this place but the reality is that the finality of the experience was horrible.  It is a really nice place in a very unusual location.  The interior is nice, old Vegas style and the booths in the main dining room are great.  The only downside is that because it's in Vegas, and despite the \"please dress classy\" code, the date with my wife was marred from the start with the ripped tank top + shorts gentleman seated right across from us.  The food....the foie gras was spectacular - very tasty.  The chopped salad was weak - the dressing had no flavor which made the iceberg+chick pea combo taste like water and sand.  The NY Strip was, well, a strip and its hard to screw that up though a bit salty. The sides were fair. My wife ordered the Short Rib.  It came cold.  As in room temperature cold.  The only thing was that the one they gave her had a lot of meat on it and when we sent it back, they replaced it with 1 that had almost no meat.  When we called the manager over, he apologized but then went on to say that it was a \"naturally fatty cut\" and that \"5oz of meat was to be expected\" but having been a cook, I can tell you that there was no 5oz on this piece.  The manager offered to switch it out but the problem with that scenario is that in the attempt to save revenue, they forgot that the meal was already ruined and waiting for another plate on an already upset timeblock was not going to fix anything.  At that point, just offer a discount and end the evening.  But even after 2 discussions with the manager, there was no such offer.  I am sure there were good plates but for the mediocrity of the food and more than that, the crappy service from the management (the waiter was fine), I just can't recommend it.  And a small note to management - learn to wear suits that are cut the right length.  Otherwise it just looks silly.",

We joked about reserving a table for every Sunday it was that good. Service was off the charts, prices were probably 30% less than Strip but the food did not suffer in any way, even the wine list was remarkably affordable. The Decor was also very old Vegas but with a new feel and twist to it...Great background music too...This place is sure to be a hit and I for one will not be a stranger!!!",

    "text": "In his long day, John Barrymore was considered by many to be the greatest American actor ever. If, Indeed heredity is a factor in the mysterious art of acting, his credentials were impeccable. The Barrymores were the Royal Family of the American theatre along with his older siblings, brother Lionel and sister Ethel. Their father, British player Maurice Blythe, gave himself a name likely to impress the natives-and chose Maurice Barrymore. John Barrymore who acted in \"Hamlet\" had a liking for martinis and he would have six of them before dinner..never eat on an empty stomach was his saying. Christopher Plummer, who is most known for singing \"Edelweiss\" in the Musical  \"Sound of Music,\" portrayed John Barrymore, in an one-man play at the Elgin theater, in Toronto, that was later made into a feature film. I saw the DVD, the performance which won a 'TONY'  for Plummer, is most riveting one man performance ever. So much so, his co-star in \"Sound of Music' Julie Andrews, claims she saw it twice.  This eatery is named after the Barrymores and the ambiance is befitting of the name. It is located on a road that is less traveled, but made famous by the hyped up, high priced and snotty-Pieros (I had the worst Osso Bucco in this place, when I was naive and nerdy taking my romantic interest and shelling lot of dough to impress. I should have taken her to In and out burger,) on one end of the stretch.   There used to be a make shift theater-home to the people who had talent but no money for four walling in a casino-in the lobby of this Royal hotel, which is the official hotel for the Airlines flight crew I was told. One fine day the fire marshals came and took the whole place down and that was the end of the make-shift.   This place is jammed when the conventions are in town and rest of the time a decent  local crowd that frequent this joint not to mention attractive women sipping pina coladas at the bar and the tenders of male gender were openly flirting and ignoring the other customers. Flirting is a temptation but ignoring other customers is SIN ! punishable by one minus rating..  The lounge is tiny and you expect soft piano music, instead there were two burly guys in the corner making some loud music, which was distracting and not in line with the ambiance-one minus rating. The little patio is fire lit and there were too many fluffy cushions that took up the sofa we had to sit down on the floor cross legged ! We looked like two Hairy Krishna's!  The main room is tucked away for the classy clientele and this is probably the only elegant and private dining room outside a casino. The menu is short but eclectic. The burger I tried was the best I had in Vegas. It was neatly presented. You better ask for a table near a waiter, since the service is scant . This place is here to stay since the pricing and quality and ambiance can't be beaten and it is the best place East of the Strip but not far from the Strip.",

The ink blot paintings on the wall were a treat to look at and although small, with a good group of friends made it just perfect.  Service here was truly jaw dropping, the friendliness of the staff and the attention to detail they provided for you is something to not over look, they take very good care of you.

    "text": "My husband and I came to The Barrymore based on all the wonderful Yelp reviews. We made reservations for 7:30 on a Saturday night but ended up arriving an hour early. So we sat at the bar. Very nice bar. We sat and had drinks made by Kendra and her tattooed buddy Cody. Very cool. Great glass of Pinot Grigio.  Tried a few of their bloody marys. We were so early that we had an appetizer at the bar. We ordered the octopus and it was phenomenal. We also ate an entire bread basket and the warm salted butter it came with was delicious. At 7:30 we moved to our table. Unfortunately, that's when things kinda went down hill. First it was freezing but immediately the hostess said something to the manager and he turned down the air con AND he checked back with us to make sure the temp was good. We then ordered the soup of the day - Barrymore's special matzah ball soup and my husband and I ordered a rare filet mignon and their lobster Mac & cheese as a side. Our service changed dramatically after we moved from the bar. We went from cool attentive Kendra and her laid back pal Cody to totally cheesy yet non attentive main waiter Louis. Louis was the kind of waiter who was like \"yes, yes anything you want\" but you ended up sitting there waiting for a piece of bread and a glass of water. Our filet came and it was completely overcooked.   We had asked for it rare and the steak we got was at best, medium ... at best. And you know that if you like your steak rare getting served a Medium steak filet is an abomination.   And the lobster Mac and cheese was bland and flavorless.  S**t happens in the restaurant business. Sometimes food doesn't come out the way you want it to. It's what the management does and how they handle things that matters. I can tell you that despite all the things that weren't perfect with our meal it was the way Chad, the manager on duty handled everything that really made Barrymore's worth going back to. Less than 4 min after our steak went back Chad was at our table. I explained to him how great everything was when we were served from the bar area and how things sadly just went downhill when we went to the main dining room. He cared!  He immediately asked what he could get us while we waited for our new steak. We swapped out the lobster Mac n cheese for corn and lobster and that was delicious. He came over and poured me another glass of wine without me asking. Then he suggested that after dinner we have dessert back up at the bar with Kendra. Chad just made you feel like he cared!  He really wanted you to enjoy your meal and experience at Barrymore's. This is THE GUY you want as your GM if you own a restaurant. He turned our experience around 180. We ended up having coffee and dessert up at the bar (totally comp'd) and spent time talking to Kendra and Chad. So ultimately, you should go The Barrymore. When you do, say hi to Kendra and Chad and have a good evening. We did.",

Our server told us that they don't advertise and rely solely on word of mouth, and that 60% of their clientele are locals, so you know it's good and also very reasonably priced for being just off the Strip. We had the rock shrimp, shrimp cocktail and crab cake to start - all were delicious. We ordered steaks and fish for our mains.

And the food wasn't *bad*, I just didn't think it matched the niceness of the decor.  People's comments about the building's exterior were spot-on...dumpy from the outside but chic on the inside.

    "text": "Well.......not great but not bad either. This place was highly recommended from a friend who lives here in Las Vegas. We split time in both Las Vegas and California and we are always on the quest for the perfect steak house. The ambiance, service were excellent. The steaks were a bit disappointing. We had 4 in our party and not one of the steaks were cooked properly. The group was a bit tipsy and no one wanted to complain. So, we slinked out the door without a complaint. The appetizers were great tasting , but extremely small. I had the Foie gras and it was about the size of a silver dollar. Disappointing for what we paid. We might give this place another try. Maybe it was a bad night for the chef.",

This is located at the end of the strip in a bad area and in an old hotel.  While the restaurant decor is very nice and fun inside, we almost got back in the cab and went elsewhere.    The food while overall pleasant, was just pleasant.  My dish was the Duck Confit which was nice but nothing exciting or different.  The couple that we went with ordered the 2.5 lb Lobster Thermador.  The description of the idem did not include mushrooms but what they received was a lobster shell filled with  80% mushrooms and almost no lobster.  They ended up sending the dish back and the staff was embarrassed at what they had served.   Our waitress was great and very attentive and the food on the whole was fine but I would not go back to this place.  There are too many other great places in Vegas.  This was the worst meal we have on our 4 day trip.  To us is was slightly above average food in a sketchy neighborhood.",

We ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese and Grilled Octopus for starters. They were both very good, but the octopus was definitely a surprise. Extremely tender and not at all chewy as I come to expect with octopus. For our entrees we ordered the Pan Seared Salmon and the Pan Roasted Duck. The sauces for both were delicious and the serving size was just right. For dessert we had the creme brulee and chocolate gelato. The creme brulee was one of the best I've ever had. Excellent presentation of each dish, it looked good and tasted even better.  The service was amazing and  we will definitely be back.",

He provided great recommendations on wine, apps, and entrees, he even called my BF and I a cab following dinner.   Everything we ordered was good.  If you get the lobster mac and cheese, I recommend splitting an entree with an extra side.   I had the burger, which I never order anywhere and it was amazing.  It's served with an english muffin rather than a typical burger bun, it's lighter and allows you to get the full flavor of the beef patty and chutney.    You defiantly feel like you stepped back in time with the old Hollywood feel.  It's a classic restaurant I could see the Rat Pack hanging out at.  Highly recommended for date night with that special someone!",

The scallops were good but the pairing with the ox-tail \"stew\" was strange.  Either item on its' own would have been good but they were just weird together...like putting BBQ sauce on a scallop.  Overall, I definitely want to come back and try some different entrees.  The place is reasonably priced considering the quality of ingredients and atmosphere.

    "text": "The Barrymore left something MORE to be desired.  After frequenting the Royal House (the hotel bar) and appreciating the ambiance and style, I thought it would be nice to try the restaurant especially with all the rave reviews.    It was a serious disappointment!  The food was mediocre, the service was lacking, and the decor was the only redeeming quality.    The aged cowboy steak didn't have much flavor and was too fatty (the addition of the steak sauce was a minor improvement; unfortunately, it finally made its way to the table when we were almost finished eating) .  The steak sandwich was blah, and you can get a better burger at fuddruckers or smash burger.  The other food was really nothing to write home about.  The service was slow considering there were only six parties and the restaurant appeared to be at half capacity. The managers/owners(?) introduced themselves to every other table except ours (there were only five other tables in a small dining room). It took ten minutes for everyone at our table (of five) to be served their entrees, so half the food was cold by the time we could eat it.  If this restaurant is supposed to be nostalgic of old vegas, it really missed the mark!  Old Vegas is about good service, good food, and a good time!  If you're looking for a classic vegas steakhouse, go to the Golden Steer.  If you're looking for a similar style, go to the Artisan.  If you're looking for a good time, stay at the bar.  All in all the experience left a bad taste in my mouth!",

The food is very good (warning, if you get the cold seafood platter, it's a bit skimpy - even with an appetizer and dessert - might want to go to the large portion even if there are only 2 of you).  Really great decor.  Such a hidden gem (the Royal Resort hotel is a simple, out of the way place).    While the food is definitely good, it's the service that really grabs you at this place and pushes things to 5 stars.  My wife and I really enjoyed talking to the General Manager last Saturday night.  He was VERY attentive and made sure everything was perfect.  He even took back a whole bottle of wine just after we ordered it because it wasn't to our satisfaction.    Small and quaint.  Just very different and a great place for couples.

    "text": "When trying to decide on a restaurant for my birthday dinner before seeing a Cirque show, I was torn. After talking to a bunch of people on TripAdvisor, the Barrymore seemed to be the place to go. I was excited to try out their menu and had high hopes.  We arrived on time for our reservation and the restaurant was empty. Completely empty. I guess we were fairly early (our reservation was for like 5:30, to allow time to eat and to get to our show) but it was a bit surprising. Our waitress was friendly and prmopt with service, chatty when it was appropriate and left us alone while we ate. I had a white russian to start (very good) and tried the foie gras appetizer and the scallops for my main. My boyfriend ended up getting the special 14 oz steak (the thing was at least an inch and a half thick, if not more.  I love foie gras and I was really looking forward to trying the appetizer. I was underwhelmed, at best. Not only did I find my foie gras undercooked, but the spiced french toast that was served under it really didn't do anything to complement the richness of the foie gras. There was quite a bit of cinnamon and for me, it completely overpowered the foie gras. I wasn't a fan of the treatment of the dish here so I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for something more savory.  I think my main was a special for the evening because I don't see it on the menu, but the scallops I had were good, but not great. They too were slightly underdone and were way way way too salty. Shellfish doesn't usually need THAT much salt to get it where its going but it was salty to a point where I stopped eating after a point. Disappointing. My boyfriend enjoyed his gigantic steak, said it was the most tender steak he'd ever eaten but not the best steak he'd ever had.  We were all too full for dessert but our waitress did bring over some pistachio and raspberry macarons for my birthday dessert. These were quite good, but by this point, I was fairly disappointed in what was a relatively reasonably priced meal.  Overall, this was an okay restaurant but for a special occasion, it really fell flat for me. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll steer clear of the Barrymore and try something different.",

This place is almost easy to miss, however once we were in we were greeted quickly and very politely, we were seated fast in a nice secluded and romantic booth. Our waiter was polite and enjoyable. He was knowledgeable in the menu and explained with great detail the specials that were not on the menu and was well versed in the steak selection and curing process of each. We ordered appetizers and drinks. The sour mash old fashioned was very good and similar to how I make them at home. We both orders the 45 day dry aged 18 oz bone in ribeye. I ordered a baked potato as well. It came with all of the sides, bacon, sour cream and chives. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare with a nice burnt crust on the outside. The meat melted and was perfect. The wife had hers cooked the same way and said she will never have it cooked any other way now. This place is also price conscious. The steak was 50 something and the baked potato wasn't much. It was a wonderful experience and we will be back",

    "text": "Maybe a 3.5. I would say better than okay, but with a big setback. You'd never expect a restaurant at this hotel.  It is located inside the Royal Resort, which looks like an old run down hotel.  Go inside and there is a bit of this old school swanky decor. The ceiling decor was a bunch of big old school looking movie reels. The table shared a bunch of appetizers. We got the steak tartare, foie gras, veal sweetbreads and lobster mac and cheese. All were tasty. For drink, I got the moscow mule which was good too.   For the main, I got the bone-in ribeye* with a side of sauteed spinach.  *I was told the meats were all grass-fed  The sides don't actually come on your plate, but a seperate dish so that makes it easy for sharing and each side is large enough for 2-3 people. More if you have a big party and just want a taste of everything. I also go to taste the creamed corn, mushrooms, and brussels sprouts. Sides were all good. Creamed corn stood out.   The rib eye was cooked to the right temperature, but the one thing that was dissapointing was the crust. It was too salty. It wasn't just mine. The table consensus was that the crust of all the steaks were too salty. I found myself having to eat the steak with something else to help counter the saltiness. I finished about 3/4 of the steak and had to quit. With all the sides and appetizers, I couldn't hang anymore.   Service was friendly and they cracked a few jokes as well. Besides the salt issue, I found everything else to be good to great.",

    "text": "I had not heard of the Barrymore before, but I was perusing the various prix fixe menus being offered for Restaurant Week and my attention was grabbed by the \"Surf, Surf & Surf\" (Chilean Sea Bass, Lobster, & Giant Grilled Shrimp).  Well, that sounded yummy.  The associated choices for the the first course (Grilled Octopus and Slab Bacon) were less appetizing to me, but you have to get adventurous sometimes with a prix fixe menu, so we were in.  Both my wife and I thought the Surf dish was fabulous.  One of the best pieces of Chilean Sea Bass I have had, an excellent and meaty lobster tail, and huge flavorful grilled shrimp.  It was too much to finish, especially after the rich, fatty bacon appetizer.  If the dessert course had not been part of the menu we probably would have passed on that, but as it turned out the deconstructed cheesecake was quite good.  The chocolate layer cake, not so much.  At $80, the meal wasn't quite the good deal that Restaurant Week meals sometimes are, but it certainly wasn't anything to gripe about.  Our server was attentive, and made an effort to be chatty and pleasant.  The portion of the restaurant where we were seated was pretty empty, so everything moved along at a brisk pace.  The one thing that just didn't seem to work for me was, for lack of a better word, the \"vibe.\"  When you walk into a hotel/motel that looks like the Royal Resort, you expect to see a coffee shop off the lobby.  The Barrymore is someone's effort to replace that coffee shop with a really high end restaurant.  But I never really got past the feeling that I was eating in a coffee shop in disguise - a vibe that was intensified by the retro 50's interior design elements.  I would say that if you go to the Barrymore, go for the food rather than the romance.",

My sister and I decided to stay in after a long day and sample the happy hour menu and a couple of drinks.  Our \"private\" mixologist, Corey, is a brilliant bartender with  knowledge of \"adult beverages\" that please the tongue.  We shared a variety of his own recipes that would make any bartender on Taffer's BAR RESCUE jealous!  All were delicious, without any residual effects the next morning.  The food on the Happy Hour menu is creative and delicious, including the grilled octopus as well as the Oysters Rockefeller using Baja Oysters. Nice surroundings, nice music and of course, nice employees...of course everything is first class in Las Vegas.",

I hate to say it but he talked us into several menu items just by his knowledge of the way the items were cooked, what they were served with and how they were displayed. He knew what he was talking about and everything that came out was delicious.   We ordered the lobster bisque, lobster mac and cheese, and pork belly to start. The bread basket was delicious as well. I enjoyed a Porn Star, while my husband ordered a Manhattan. Both drinks were delicious, but the Manhattan was so smooth we ordered two more. Israel recommended a wine that paired perfectly with my husbands meal.  On to the entrees! I ordered their special sea bass, while my husband picked the Rib-eye. My sea bass was a little fishy but the flavors surrounding the fish helped drown that out quite a bit. The asparagus was on point though! My husbands rib-eye looked amazing & according to him tasted amazing.   All in all the best part of our dinner was the service. Thank you Israel for making our evening that much more special! We will definitely come back!",

We shared a lobster bisque appetizer and unfortunately, it was probably the worst part of the meal =/ It was terribly salty and they were very stingy with the lobster -- it actually came in tiny stringy bits rather than the typical pieces or chunks.  However, their 14 oz. New York strip steak redeemed the meal!! I also ordered a side of their grilled jumbo shrimp. Both the steak and the shrimp were delicious and perfectly cooked. I was pretty sad that I wasn't able to finish my steak =( it was THAT good.  Husband ordered their duck and we shared a side of sauteed spinach. Both were also very good (but spinach was a bit too salty)! Their portions are very generous, if that wasn't obvious enough.  Service was very friendly and attentive. This was a great steak dinner and I'll definitely be visiting again when I need my meat!",

    "text": "I'd just like to start by saying that it pains me to give this place 2 stars because I was hoping for so much more! We took a little getaway to Vegas this past weekend. I wanted to eat some place local, not a big chain in a newer casino. I saw awesome reviews for the Barrymore and booked a reservation for Friday night.   We were seated in a tiny little room to the side of the bar with a few tables. For some reason I was expecting a much larger dining room from the pictures online but whatever. Our server was excellent, very professional and knew her stuff. After explaining to her that my husband doesn't eat onions and gags at the flavor we opted for the morel risotto with no onions. From the moment the dish hit the table my husband's face fell. We could smell the onions a mile off. The first flavor on the palate once we took a bite was straight onion. I felt so bad for the hubs - he was as excited as I was about this place.   We ordered the steak special for 2 (a 30 oz steak with 3 sauces), the creamed corn and lobster and the brussels sprouts with bacon.   Steak: Ordered medium rare and it was definitely rare - almost raw. The flavor was good so we ate it as we were starving and didn't feel like waiting for a new one.   Creamed corn and lobster: NOPE. Couldn't taste an ounce of seafood in this dish.   Brussels sprouts: Way undercooked with no flavor. This dish needed more time and salt.   The cocktails were good but this was the most disappointing $200 I've ever had. We had to stop and get a snack later because my husband was so hungry when we left. Such a sad, sad experience - we will never be back.",

And let me tell you...those couple of miles puts you in a very different atmosphere. This was old school Vegas. Which I normally don't mind. In fact, I prefer old school Vegas, the local's Vegas, off-season Vegas...you get the idea. But if you're at a restaurant, all you're going to care about is the food. And nope...this restaurant was not worth the effort it took to get here.  In short, most of our entrees were overly salted. One rib-eye was undercooked, one filet was overcooked, one duck was chewy. When you're paying around $50 for a plate, it better be pretty effin good. Unfortunately, it was just okay. The service was great - at both the restaurant and the hotel. (Thanks Tyrel for trying to help me locate my phone!) But I would be hesitant to recommend this restaurant when there are so many other options around and much closer to the strip.",

    "text": "Let's not waste any time here on this review. My wife and I were vacationing in Las Vegas and decided to pick The Barrymore Resturant to celebrate my birthday and have a last night in Las Vegas romantic dinner. Our Uber driver dropped us off in front of the Barrymore and we have to admit we were a little apprehensive about going in although it has a 5 Star rating. The Barrymore is not located on the main strip, it's not part of the big chain hotels. and it's not on the food channels famous chefs list. As we approached the entry of the dinning room we were met by Brian the  Maitre D and beautiful live music  entertainment. Brian greeted us so professionally and brought us to our dining room table where he took the time to explain the menu and specials for the evening. Brian also answered any questions that we had about anything we wanted to know. As an appetizer we ordered the Lobster Macaroni and cheese, for the main course my wife ordered the salmon and I ordered the 8oz Rib eye steak, for side we had the sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes. All we can say was Oh My God. The food was absolutely amazing,  for desert we had coffee and the Japanese version of cheesecake. I have to also give credit to the service we received as well. I'm not sure who the Chef is but, they also deserve a huge shout out. So if you're ever in Las Vegas and want get away from all the nonsense check out The Barrymore for an enjoyable evening of food and fun.",

    "text": "Has the time come where I am so jaded from such amazing restaurant experiences that I set my hopes too high when going to other high end restaurants? The Barrymore was chosen from a Yelp search while spending a couple nights in Vegas for my brother's birthday. I had reserved a table online and was easily able to push the time back an hour and a half when we realized we would be late (time flies when you're gambling...I mean...having fun). When we arrived at the hotel we noticed that the hotel like most other Yelpers have mentioned on the reviews is quite boring and weird. It was really quiet that you almost wouldn't expect to have a nice steakhouse inside and the woman at the front desk just looked as us when we walked in. When you're in an empty lobby and there's only one other person, usually a \"Hello\" or \"Welcome\" is nice.   Anyways, we walked into the restaurant and were greeted by a very nice gentleman who showed us to our booth. The restaurant was pretty empty for a Thursday night but I know it was 9pm so I didn't think much of it. There was one giant table finishing up but when they left we were the only ones inside. The interior of the steakhouse is beautiful. Very old classic Vegas with leather booths, smoked mirrors on the walls, just the right amount of dim lighting and  of course a nice full bar. We were greeted by our server who was nice but almost seemed annoyed that we were there. I know we must have been the last table but why were we able to make reservations if they didn't want anyone there? When he talked to us he talked very fast and kept looking away like he wanted to be somewhere else. We didn't feel engaged, more so rushed as we tried to ask some questions about the menu. For drinks we saw there was a check in offer for a free glass of house wine with a purchase of 25$. The four of us asked to use our offers and while the wine was tasty, I felt like as soon as we did that they didn't think of us as high paying customers anymore.   The food, of course, was cooked well and tasted great. The steak is more on the rare side when you order medium rare but the portions are large and the sides are very rich. We tried the bacon and lobster corn, risotto and Brussels sprout side dishes. All were cooked perfectly and added a great richness to our New York steaks and Ribeye. We had also enjoyed the grilled octopus ceviche with mango but the octopus was definitely not in ceviche form, more like three grilled tentacles with a mango salsa and a couple plantain chips. The octopus was cooked well and you are also served a variety of breads in a basket. Most were very dry but probably because it was the end of the night.   We were thankful for the chocolate dessert brought out complimentary for my brother's birthday with a candle on top. We really appreciated the gesture but that cake was brought out by the man from the front desk who had checked on us during out meal with a warm smile on his face - something we hadn't felt from out waiter. We grabbed the check and headed out of the place without much to say about the experience. Even though it wasn't a bad dinner, unfortunately the Barrymore most likely won't be on our list of places to come back to the next time we are in Las Vegas.",

I was here for a corporate biz event and they pulled no stops at The Barrymore with service, drinks, and food.  Don't be freaked out by the weirdo hotel it's adjacent to with the 100 year old cool dude playing piano in the lobby, and the kitschy Vegas decor, along with C grade shows being performed here. Once you walk into the actual restaurant it's all class.   The main dining room we were in had some terrific booths and a dark wood community table, along with a ceiling adorned with film reels that bring back the golden age of movies. The food was top notch along with the wine selection. Trays of seafood appetizers, large jumbo shrimp cocktails, and seafood entrees. As a non-red meat eater this was perfect. Those who did have steak proclaimed it was delicious.   Those waiting on our tables and serving us made sure we had a great time. My wine glass was constantly being filled. Just a really good choice for a corporate event or biz dinner with clients.  Old school Las Vegas in the best of ways.",

At first, it seems a teensy weensy bit shady considering it's located within a 2-3 star hotel at the North end of The Strip.  However, once you arrive inside, you see the cool, glitzy interior that is Hollywood-themed.    They were able to accommodate me with vegetarian options for all 3 courses.  For my appetizer, I had a berry salad.  For my main entree, I had a vegetable coconut curry dish that was served with quinoa.  For dessert, I had the key lime tart.  All 3 dishes were excellent - especially the curry dish.",

The decor is tasteful and inviting.   To the food and service...  We ordered the foie gras and bone marrow as starters. The foie gras was seared but it just didn't taste right. Many other accompaniments were tried to enhance the favor but nothing helped.  The bone marrow was undercooked--still bloody in the mid parts. It is served with a sliver of toast. It was the worst bone marrow that I've tried. The buffets on the strip do it better.   Next to the entrees. The steaks were standard. Nothing memorable about them. The brussels sprouts lacked any seasoning. Additional salt was needed to make them tolerable. The truffle potatoes were good--nice flavor and consistency.  The waiter recommended the Oscar fries. Some in our party were fans.   The service was quite lacking. It took over 10 minutes for our server to return to take our food order. The guy filing our water cups was on point. The worst interaction of the night was the ?sommelier. We weren't quite sure who she was because she never introduced herself. She spoke mostly in a loud, condescending tone. I felt like any concern she did offer was forced.   I would not recommend this place.",

The outside seating for happy hour makes you feel like you are a celebrity. The happy hour specials are a good bang for your buck (20$ bottle of really good champagne hollaaaa).   Everything we got was amazing but my favs were : steak (duh), oyster appetizer, and the cream corn and lobster.   The service was amazing and definitely made the experience. We had Louis who was very accommodating- he answered all our questions and made great recommendations. He convinced me to try the bone marrow add on for my steak and I'm so glad I did it. I never had bone marrow and it was amazing how they prepared.   Will definitely go back if in the Las Vegas area. No complaints. The food is higher priced but you definitely get what you paid for.",

The food was good(carpaccio, Chilean sea bass, short ribs), the drinks were flowing (bourbon on the rocks plus an extensive whiskey and wine menu) and the ambience was straight out of my Casino dreams.   The price was on the steep side, for my meager wallet at least. Dinner for two (appetizer, two entrees, shared side, two drinks each) was $200. The staff was friendly enough, albeit a bit reserved. They were of the be seen but not heard variety, when I prefer more of the Hey let me have a seat at your table and tell you about the specials variety.

The first thing that caught my attention was the lobster mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was not heavy at all. It was the perfect mac n cheese. Their bread basket is also out of the ordinary.

Upon entering the hotel it's in, it appeared as though the restaurant was closed. We almost turned around and left but the man working the front informed us otherwise. We walk in and get glared at by the worlds most unhospitable hostess and decide to sit in the lounge tables. Mind you, we're the only ones in this place. After being greeted by a server, we decide to sit in the dining room instead. Our server.... where to start. Classic jaded Las Vegas server. Explains all the specials to us and rehearses some spiel about Drew Barrymore. As I try to engage in the conversation he shifts his attention to more specials and walks away. We came with a party of 4 and ordered a bunch of apps, entrees and sides to share. However, because we ordered so much food we only got one steak. The server walks away after taking our order with a snappy comment \"OK, one steak to share, for all four of you.\" After getting our food, everything was ok but the lobster mac and cheese which I was MOST excited to try. Guess what, not one single piece of lobster in it. I told the manager when he checked on us and said \"oh that's weird, i'll take it off the check.\" I didn't care for it to be off the check, but expected they would send out a new one. Never did, and never bothered to take it off the check. We didn't end up saying anything, just paid our $350 check and left. I'm still confused where that money went. Definitely was not worth it.",

Lobster Mac and cheese had very little lobster.   Environment:  Beautifully designed restaurant located in a 2.5 star hotel.   Service:  Very attentive.",

Everyone raves about this place but for me, the atmosphere is interesting but not exactly high end, the service very proper almost to the point of aloof & snotty (remember folks I went there two times, two waiters two chances at the menu) and the food is tiny. I have said it. T I N Y. Oh such small food, like we don't live in the land of plenty. Like their food is so inspired and delicious that they can charge a bazillion for a tiny bowl of mac n cheese with some seafood sprinkled in. I guess I am just irritated because I am still so hungry and my wallet is just that much emptier.",

Having had both lunch and dinner at The Barrymore, I can assure you the food and the service are just as lovely.  Our lunch party of 4 enjoyed every morsel of our repast.  We were seated in the smaller dining area.  Our sandwiches were accompanied by mini fry baskets filled with perfectly crisp french fries.  Apple pie for dessert had a yummy buttery crust; thoroughly delicious.  For dinner, we were seated in the main dining room, in one of the plush curved booths along the wall (so retro!  I loved it!) and were attended by two friendly and very competent waiters.  We ordered cocktails which were perfectly prepared, followed by wine service provided by the house sommelier.  He gave a good recommendation and presentation; however, we never saw him after that as the waiters did the rest of the wine-pouring for the evening.  The French onion gratin soup was quite possibly the best I have ever tasted in my life.  Diver scallops over oxtail stew were luscious.  The short rib was so tender, like buttah!  The pasta dish consisted of a generous portion of homemade pasta with a veal/beef/pork bolognese sauce and ricotta.  My husband ate the whole thing.  Pear creme brulee was True custardy deliciousness, which we enjoyed with our capuccinos.  I understand they've only been open for a couple of months which probably explains why the dining room only had 4 tables of guests that evening.  Once word gets out, though, they're going to have a line going out the Royal Resort door!",

The one thing I will say is that it's not directly on the strip, and it's slightly too far to walk (especially if you are all dressed up for the evening and don't want to get sweaty). But that said, it's only a five minute cab ride (or less) away, and is totally worth it.   Great food and drinks, and not too terribly expensive, you can get out of here for under $100 for two people if you really want. We ordered drinks to start, I got a bellini and the bf got the Barrymore (their version of an old fashioned) which was very smooth. We got the lobster mac and cheese for an appetizer, very yummy. Ordered sea bass and the prime steak special for entrees. The sea bass was good, but the steak was spectacular, cooked perfectly and very flavorful. And for dessert we got the warm chocolate cake, again probably some of the best I've ever had. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, and actually recommended some of the items that ended up being our favorites. He even brought complimentary sparkling wine to have with our dessert.   Would recommend this place to anyone, great for date night or special occasions. It is small and intimate, so they recommend making reservations.",

The ambience is wonderful, the staff is so warm, and the food was out of this world. Extensive wine list that has a little bit of everything. The server is great at making recommendations. Awesome cocktails...bartender definitely knows what he's doing. But the best part by far was the food. Interesting, beautiful, delicious dishes. Each thing I tried was better than the last. My favorites were the panzanella salad, NY, scallops, and lobster Mac and cheese. And you definitely have to end with the chocolate cake. The whole experience was so amazing that I had to go back again the next night for round two. From now on I will never do a Vegas trip without eating at the Barrymore at least once!",

Outside of the excellent quality food and moderate pricing (especially in Vegas) there was one thing that stood out above all. That was the service that we recieved. I would venture to say this was the best service I have had from any restaurant. They were friendly, funny and attentive to the tinest of details. For me this took the Barrymore to the next level. If ever in Vegas and you want fine dining and take a break from the insanity of the Strip this is the place to eat.",

    "text": "I really liked the ambiance of this restaurant. It has that old hollywood vibe.   My husband and I had reservations for Friday night. We got there a little early so we could have a drink in the bar- just our thing. The bar area is really small and a bit understated.  The main dining area was much more impressive.The food was great. They started us out with a nice selection of bread. We weren't tremendously hungry since we had a late afternoon snack of tuna carpaccio at a different restaurant so skipped the appetizers and salads. My husband had the filet and I had the lamb. Both were amazing! The lamb was seriously one of the best lamb dishes I have ever had.  I was a bit disappointed with the selection of sides. We ordered sauteed spinach but there was no lobster mac and cheese on the menu so we ordered the mashed potatoes. They were good, but when my husband and I are looking to indulge, we want rich crab or lobster mac and cheese. The food was definitely 4/5 star.  But to the three-star rating. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. However, I wasn't sure if it was the sommelier or the manager that brought our wine out to us but he just had a snotty attitude. We had ordered a nice 2011 Ridge Zinfandel and when he brought it out we noticed it was a 2012 bottle. My husband said something and the sommelier/manager gave us a curt response that the 2012 was a better year anyway. He didn't reduce the price of the bottle, didn't ask if we would rather make another selection, just started opening the bottle. The wine was nice... but either way, I wasn't very impressed with the guy's attitude.",

    "text": "Dear Barrymore,   I just met you last night, but I have to let you know about how I feel. At the very start of the evening you blew me away with your old-school-gone-chic-fun-and-funky vibe. Your taste in music is classic and exquisite - wooing me from the start with a soundtrack that includes Billie Holiday. From the plush velvet tuck and roll booths to the faux velvet flocked black and gold wallpaper you looked too cool for school, but your open and friendly attitude made even older folks like my husband and I totally feel welcomed.   Our server, Israel, was FANTASTIC! Although he was pretty busy hopping from table to table, he took the time to talk to us about your history, the family that started the entire Block 16 restaurant group, recommend a bottle of wine from your sexy glass encased wine cellar and even call me by first name. Super attentive and always willing to enthusiastically rave about your food.    After having a grilled octopus epiphany at Estiatorio Milos, I've been searching out other restaurants in town that have their own version.  In fact, doing a Yelp! search on \"grilled octopus\" is what brought me to you in the first place. The tantilizing tentacles came beautifully mounded in the center of the plate with papas bravas, topped with celery leaf and bordered with dots of spicy tomato and chorizo oil. You delectable devil you! The octopus was of a thicker cut than Milos', which made it a bit difficult to cut through, but was surprisingly soft and non-rubbery. As with all your wonderful dishes, it was a sum of its parts for sure.  Next up - your Roasted Black Cod with brandade fritter, creamed leeks and squid ink buerre. I don't know if I'm imagining things, but this seemed like you were subtly winking at me and flirting by showing off your sense of humor. Beautifully presented, each item on the plate was solid within itself - but eaten all together?  I definitely got a kind of deconstructed and elevated \"fish and chips\" vibe - mainly coming from the inclusion of the fritter. Oh Barrymore, you're so charming and witty.  We don't usually do dessert, but one glance at the menu we were once again seduced by your charms. Israel suggested the Creme Brulee with balsamic strawberries, basil lime sherbet and black pepper shortbread - which we went for.  Again, a sum of its parts - I wasn't sure how the basil-lime sherbet was going to work - but boy, does it ever. Acidic cool and redolent with basil up against the creamy sweetness of the brulee and the tanginess of strawberries - you've shown me how thrilling a terrific dessert can be. I'm ruined.  I'm sure you get a lot of love letters - and I don't expect to enter into a monogamous relationship or anything - but this one night stand was one for the ages. Thanks Barrymore!",

    "text": "*sigh* Oh, how I wish The Barrymore was located in San Diego instead of Las Vegas!  I haven't been this impressed with a dining establishment since I can't remember when.    Love, love, love the old-school Hollywood decor, dim lighting, and deep, plush leather booths line the dining room. The ceiling is decorated with old film reels, the vibe is very retro-Vegas with a heavy dash of Mad Men. Although we didn't sit outside, I caught a glimpse of fireside outdoor seating off the bar area.  I admit that I had been drooling over the menu for days in anticipation of our Saturday dinner reservation. So many amazing looking choices!  The menu read like a Hollywood A-List with a high number of Oscar winners.  Instead of giving a review for each dish, I'm just going to come out and say that everything that made its way to our table and into our bellies was top of the line delicious.  Presentation, composition, flavor...these dishes had it all.   Our appetizers: Roasted Heirloom Beets (the goat cheese fritters..I die!!), Roasted Artichokes, Lobster Mac & Cheese (my personal Achilles's heel).  The Caesar Salad and French Onion Soup might possibly be the average plates delivered.  Not bad, just completely outshone by the other dishes.  Dinner: Diver Scallops, Pan Roasted \"Jidori\" Chicken, Short Rib Bourguignon, Muscovy Duck Confit, Bone-in Aged Ribeye.  There wasn't a stinker in the lot.  All perfectly cooked and seasoned (although I personally would prefer a tiny bit less salt, it did not necessarily taste over salted).    Excellent cocktail and wine selections, too.  The biggest star of the show had to be the service.  It was amazing.  Really was the clincher for a perfect evening.  They know what they're doing at The Barrymore.  I hope to go back again and again!",

We had 110 of our closets friends and family share the day with us.  We planned this event from Nashville and chose the Barrymore based on the fantastic intimate space, menu and fellow reviewers.   FOOD:  Delicious! We had a buffet menu  of roasted chicken, filet (all of the filets were cooked to perfection), asparagus, roasted fingerling potatoes, salad, lobster mac n cheese, chocolate chip cookies and cupcakes. MY guests are still raving about the food!!!   SERVICE: The Block 16/Barrymore team were so professional and accommodating. Chastity Bebe assisted me with the planning and she answered all 200 of my emails within a business day and with a pleasant tone. I felt from day one that she personally gave a damn about the success of my event, better yet my special day.  Chastity was consistent and even attended the event to make sure it was executed to perfect.   The Restaurant GM, Sergio G. and his crew treated my guests with the utmost respect and care. The service was really beyond my expectations. The bartenders executed our signature drinks with precision. Sergio made me feel like a princess.   AMBIANCE: The restaurant is romantic and fun! The blue room, the gold room, the bar, the patio. it is such a special place.   Just go and give the Barrymore a shot! Tell them Natalie sent you!!",

I'm an adventurous diner who likes to try new places, but I just couldn't resist a second go here. The first year I had short rib, the second year I had duck. Both years, my boyfriend and I had the foie gras (since foie is unfortunately illegal in California) and ended with my dessert of choice, creme brulee. Everything we've eaten has been decadent and perfect tasting.  They have great cocktails and a pretty good wine list. Service is wonderful. It's a very small restaurant, with two dining rooms - one off to the right and one past the bar. You need to come here with your significant other (not a large group, obviously) and sink into a red booth making googly eyes at each other. That's what everyone else will be doing.",

We ordered grilled octopus, crab claws, duck con fit, grilled asparagus, and bone in rib-eye medium rare. The Barrymore cocktail was pretty good as well.  Note: if you want a booth seating make reservations for 3 or more. If not you will be seating at a small table next to the window.",

    "text": "Very cool place.  The atmosphere is fantastic and the staff is incredible.  Everyone knew exactly when we needed them and no one overstayed their welcome.  We started with the lobster bisque, which was a little salty in my opinion, and a little pricey at $20.  The presentation was nice; a gravy boat to poor the broth over lobster, cracker and caviar.  We had the foie, the steak tartare, roasted brussel sprouts with bacon, and a New York steak.  The steak was the clear winner.  I ordered it on the rare side of medium rare and they couldn't have done a better job.  Nice grill marks, good sear, and delicious flavor.  The brussel sprouts were good, but I have made them a little better at home myself.  The foie and steak tartare were both excellent.  In fact, my date may argue that the steak tartare was the winner for the night.  Bottom line, if you want to try something different and you want to go somewhere that's off the beaten path, The Barrymore is a great choice.",

I made a reservation and was referred to by name throughout our meal. The general manager also made a stop by my table toward the end of our meal to inquire about our dining experience. Top notch service in a beautiful restaurant with A+ food.  Instead of ordering entrees, my friend and I decided on salads and appetizers. The Barrymore does not disappoint.  Heirloom Tomato & Hearts of Palm: Pleasing to the eye, vibrant with yellow and red tomatoes and topped with burrata cheese. Flavorful and fresh, with cracked black pepper.   Pan Seared Foie Gras: An amazingly large portion of foie gras atop a small slice of bread pudding, paired with a caramelized fig. All the flavors complimented each other and is the best foie gras I have had in Las Vegas.  Lobster Mac & Cheese: A favorite, as I can tell from other Yelp reviews, and it did not disappoint. Although it was quite heavy - a demanding appetizer, make sure you share this one!   Manjari Chocolate Cake: A decadent way to end our evening, with raspberry sauce and a scoop of pistachio ice cream. Excellent.  Overall our experience here was spectacular. I would highly recommend a trip to The Barrymore to anyone.",

    "text": "Spent $300 on dinner for 2, Really nice dining room, beautiful bar, warm, friendly waiter, well made cocktails and classic 'splurge-y' dinner menu that is overpriced but well executed. They under-cooked our steak, which seems to be epidemic in this town, ordering 'medium' means you're gonna get 'rare' anyway.  We ended up eating our sides while waiting for the re-fire on the steak, These things happen though and I would never judge a restaurant by a single kitchen incident. Everything was delicious.  The Barrymore is quiet and feels hidden. I'd think this would be a great place to meet someone on the down-low.  Or to take a date if you didn't want them looking around the room at other people (there aren't likely to be any) I did see some escort-looking types coming out of the hotel elevator, which makes the curious part of me want to return for happy hour, see if I was right..   In general, I really liked the place, it's one of those spots you'll feel 'in' that you know about.",

The sweetness of the cream corn paired really well with the little bites of lobster. The short rib was so juicy and tender. Fall off the bone tender. The cream corn and the mirepoix helped balance out the bold flavor from the beef. Delicious.",

The shining star was the Artichokes Salad, I could have eaten 3 more.  The pretzel rolls and parmesan flar bread are amazing as well. Everything else had potential to be great but fell flat.  The shrimp was soggy and had very little sauce on it.  The bartender and waitress recommended the sea bass, which was bland and boring. I don't understand why there are so many reviews on yelp saying how good it is.  The short rib was tasty and rich but the root vegetable mirepoix was greasy and had an unpleasant flavor.  I wanted so badly to love this restaurant, they have amazing drink specials and a really nice ambiance but the food needs some work.",

It felt very intimate and our server Daniel was very sweet to us. The steak was cooked to perfection (get the sauteed spinach it's divine) and even added a round of shots on the house after dinner. All of us girls had a great time and will definitely be returning next time.",

For dessert I had a complimentary bday dessert that I was able to choose from the menu. I chose the guava cheesecake that came with the pineapple-orange sorbet.

The Barrymore kept popping up and on our last night there, we were finally able to make it into this wonderful gem.   Located off the strip, and in a less than glamorous hotel, the Barrymore is great escape for a romantic, intimate meal. The decor is dark, classy and very intimate. It's a great date spot for sure!  Here's what we ordered:  Appetizers: Grilled Octopus ($16)- a MUST order!  Caesar Salad ($12)  Entrees: Chilean Sea Bass $(35) The best Sea Bass, I have EVER had. Outstanding!  NY Strip ($37) Steak was cooked perfectly!  Cocktails: Spring Lilly ($14) The Barrymore ($13)  Dessert: They made us a special espresso martini- so good!   They made a mistake on our entree order. My fiance had ordered the NY Strip, and I think our server had written it down wrong because she brought out a filet. When we let her know that it wasn't what we had ordered, she sincerely apologized. They brought out a shrimp cocktail appetizer in the meantime so that he could have something to eat while he waited a bit longer for his steak. The shrimp cocktail was so good! The shrimps were HUGE and fresh!   Two different managers came to our table to apologize for the mix up, which I found quite impressive. They brought us another round of drinks as well and when dessert time came, it was on the house. I was more than grateful and impressed at how they handled the situation. We weren't upset to begin with, but it definitely made all the difference in the world that they truly cared about our experience at the Barrymore.    Overall, the BEST dinner place we visited in Las Vegas. Every time we visit Vegas now, the Barrymore is a must! It's on my top list for favorite places.   They also have a great wine list. It's hard to decipher between ordering a cocktail or a bottle of wine since both options looked great!   Thank you for your outstanding service, your amazing food, and just a wonderful experience on our last night. We will most definitely be returning every time we're in town.",

The dining area is cozy but elegant with the singer from the bar areas voice creating a romantic atmosphere.  The service was exceptional!  I had the sea bass which was flavorful, fresh and delicious!   My husband had the bone in ribeye which was to die for! The flavor was amazing and cooked to perfection.  We shared a baked potatoe with all the fixings.   For dessert we enjoyed the Sundae for 2- so yummy!!  We brought our own wine and the corking fee was 30 dollars although I don't recall seeing it on our bill.  Again, the staff was a delight - Heidi made a real impression on us.   We will most assuredly be back when in Vegas.  We had dined a a \"fancy steakhouse \" the night before and were so underwhelmed - it was wonderful when we had such an amazing meal and service and a restaurant not many have heard of.  I would give 5 stars but the restroom is across the hotel lobby and in heels that's a long walk.  Literally the only bad thing I can say is the bathroom location.   Do yourself a favor and check this place out.  I also saw they have a nice happy hour which we will try and make it to next time around.",

Yuck!   If you don't like steak or seafood, forget it. They had ONE other option for non-steak-and-seafood lovers, the free range chicken. It was a whopping $29 and I REALLY wasn't that impressed with it. The skin was kind of burnt, and the potatoes it came with were bland. I tried the tuna tartar appetizer and I wasn't feeling that, either.   This definitely should be a 3-star restaurant. They make it seem all glitzy & glamorous in the photos, but it's actually in a jenky ass hotel located way off the strip. The additional star is for the good service, they did have that on point.   Also, it's so dark in there that my older co-workers had to use a freaking flashlight to see their menus. Pathetic!   Overall, this little hole in the wall is overrated!",

The lobster Mac and cheese and cream corn are a must but the fillet minion was nothing special. The highlight of the meal for me was the key lime cheesecake, quite delicious!

Lobster corn fantastic.  Fois Gras perfectly cooked.  Short ribs were fantastic.  House wine was really good.  The bartender made us the best espresso martinis.   We sat after dinner at the bar and enjoyed margaritas, again listening to the live music.    If this place was on the strip it would be packed nightly.  Worth coming here.  Don't let that its in a crappy hotel fool you.  This place is impressive.  Top notch.   Nice to have a quiet place to enjoy with your special someone in between the madness of the strip.",

Goodness knows how many backroom deals have gone on over a perfect steak, but the place practically speaks of it! The best cocktails start a meal that is so much better than all the pompous overpriced crap you will find on the strip. Yes when you show up you will wonder why the hell you are at a run down hotel, but seconds later once you are in the restaurant it just won't matter. Hopefully the real estate never becomes so valuable that it closes for some mega resort. For now support this wonderful old Vegas restaurant!",

    "text": "The Barrymore is like taking a step back into time during the days of the Rat Pack and when mobsters ran Las Vegas. It has a masculine, sophisticated feel with a touch of Hollywood seen in the golden movie reels that hang from the ceilings, and the Rorschach-esque artwork of celebrities from a previous era. All of this is located in an unsuspecting off-Strip hotel.  The menu offers an array of appetizing starters and several entrees that are familiar (roasted chicken, duck, steak), yet have their own unique touches. Even though the Muscovy Duck caught my eye, I went the \"lighter\" route by ordering a salad and sharing two appetizers with my friend.   Heirloom Tomato & Hearts of Palm: Basically, another take on the caprese salad with its sliced tomatoes, basil, and burrata cheese. Very good.  Pan Seared Foie Gras: By far, the best that I've tried in Vegas. The flavor of the caramelized fig complements the rich, fatty flavor of the foie gras.   Lobster Mac & Cheese: Rich, cheesy and delicious, but on the heavy side for being an appetizer.   Manjari Chocolate Cake: The single scoop of pistachio ice cream that accompanies this goes great with the chocolate and cherry custard.   Service was excellent and personable. My friend made reservations in advance and throughout the whole evening they referred to her by name. Our server did an amazing job taking care of us, even as the night became increasingly busy. The manager even stopped by each of the tables to see how everyone was doing. Really, could they go even more above and beyond in assuring guests that they're at their service?   The Barrymore provides for an intimate dining experience with delicious food, attention to detail, and first-class service. This place is truly a hidden gem.",

The restaurant is located at a hotel that's off of a small street from Las Vegas blvd. It can easily be missed if you're not sure where your going. The restaurant itself is nice, but very quiet. My main dish I ordered had great flavor (the short rib). The grilled octopus however was a little bland.   The service was ok as well. It could have been a little better considering the restaurant wasn't that busy. I'd return here only if I'm looking to go on a date at a place with a non-noisy atmosphere that's somewhat secluded from other restaurants in Vegas.  Dinner 1/25/2014",

There was a table of 2 already enjoying their dinner and it seems our party of 10 was the last of the night. The main room is absolutely gorgeous, however it is also rather small (ergo I can see how it can be hard to get a reservation).  Don't come here expecting revolutionary gastronomic new fancy dishes, instead expect classic French.  Sadly the food overall is just OK. Nothing great. The yelp offer for a free glass per person ended up capping out at 8. They ended up charging us for 2 glasses at the end of the night because of it and said nothing could be done since the register wouldn't let them take it off. It was extremely shady. Taking off a star just for that.",

I guess the location is (kinda) beside the point.  Went for dinner last night and we shared an iceberg wedge salad (they split it for us, which was nice), lobster mac and cheese, and the famous burger.  The salad was skippable.  The lobster mac and cheese was good but I think I was expecting something more monumental given all the other solid yelp reviews.  The burger was definitely the standout of the meal so thanks to yelpers for letting us know that we could secretly order it even though it was not on the menu.  We had a few beers to go along with the meal & the total bill just under $100, not bad at all.   They served us mini macaroons with our bill which was a nice touch too :)  All in all, a pretty good place but probably not one that I will make a concerted effort to seek out again when I am in town.",

    "text": "It is unfortunate that the service at this establishment is so terrible, because otherwise it would be a decent place for a meal hidden away from the Strip.  The food was decent, but my experience here for my girlfriend's birthday is what drops their score to one star.  We came here in a large group and filled up what otherwise would have been an empty dining room on a Saturday.  The waiter, Daniel, tried to chum up to us by claiming he was \"half-Asian\", even though he looked 100% Caucasian.  Regardless of whether he really was of Asian decent, my suspicion is that he was trying to sell us on their overpriced bottles of champagne, which he claimed would be a great way to celebrate the birthday girl w/a toast, and he'd throw in a free dessert too.  One of us brought a bottle of wine, and Daniel said he'd waive the corkage fee ($35) if we got the champagne.  We thought, why not, and ordered his suggestion, the Gruet Rose, priced at $85 (I later looked up the retail price for this, and it's $16.99! What a ripoff).    Once we got seated, Daniel's poor service began to show.  We came in near the end of happy hour, but Daniel didn't notify us that it was last call to get cheap drinks.  Instead, when we realized it was near the end of happy hour, instead of encouraging us to go, he gave the impression that he did not want us to make it, even running out to the bar area to let the bartender know that we were too late.  Dinner itself was served very slowly, and I was missing my fork for a while.  Because of the long wait at dinner, we found ourselves bumped up against the clock, and we had to get out of there to attend another engagement.  We waived him down for the check, and in our rush, almost missed seeing that the corkage fee was NOT waived.  Thinking this was a misunderstanding, and a quick fix, we told Daniel, who flat out denied that he'd waive the fee.  We asked to speak to the manager (did not catch his name, but he was old, Caucasian, and had white facial hair), thinking he would have no problem waiving a $35 fee on a meal of more than 1k.  But, nope.  He was even more rude.  We explained the situation in a cool, calm manner, despite being in a rush, but to deaf ears.  Afterall, the gratuity was already included in the bill, so why should they care to give good service?  They also did not bring out the promised free dessert until we specifically asked for it.  Eventually we decided we'd wasted enough time, and basically were forced to pay tip for terrible service, and a corkage fee that should have been waived.  The whole experience left such a bad taste in our mouths that several of us called up the general manager AFTER we had already returned home from our vacation.  Eventhough the general manager eventually issued refunds for the tip and corkage fee, we had to bug him to get it done.  In any case, this isn't even about the money.  It's about the principle of the situation.  I'm a guy, and I'm used to getting treated poorly.  However, even for me, this was one of the worst dining experiences of my life, and it completely ruined the birthday celebration.  The valet guy outside treated us better than the servers inside.  tldr; worst service ever, ruined birthday, bad management",

The atmosphere and decoration of the restaurant make you feel like you've transported a little to Classic Vegas.  Every detail, the booths, old film reel ceiling, and eagle statuettes, are excellent touches.  Service was very friendly, quick, and not overly attentive.  Every person we encountered was personable and willing to help.  Our waiters suggested better options based on our taste, which did not disappoint.  Chad the GM even stopped by our table to chat a little, take our picture, and thank us for dining there.   Delicious variety of bread for starters; perfect temperature on the medium Filet Mignon; and a rich yet refreshing salmon dish to die for. The Creme Brulee with Basil Lime Sherbet was amazing and the Peach Galette was a perfect way to end a great meal.  It's very rare now to find a place in Vegas on the Strip where you can avoid all the traffic, lines, crowds, and utter chaos but still enjoy a truly amazing dining experience.",

I ate lunch there 3 or 4 times  (this is not the main dining room so don't be disappointed if you had dinner there) the main room is just-BETTER. 5 STARS SERVICE, no complaints. Plus the HOST/MGR is easy on the eyes. 5 STARS ATMOSPHERE= DARK, SEXY, COMPACT,VEGAS STYLE. 5 STARS FOOD=Front dining / lunch area is where I first experienced this little treasure.  If I remember right, the chef is tied in with the Cosmopolitan/ Holstein's Restaurant (another FAV of mine) Hamburger is 'yummm', MAC/ cheese/ Lobster 'double yum', boiled eggs with caviar, salmon 'oh yes', steak wonderful.  Like I said, I have loved everything about Barrymore's. It pains me to share this because it might become too busy, but they deserve the compliments.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews and suggestions from others- I decided to take a party of 6 to the Barrymore for meal that was sure to impress. A great hidden gem with Las Vegas history and roots back to the MGM pre Ballys.  Decor and ambiance are spot on. Old Hollywood glam and intimate - I think they place only seats about 50 or so. 5 stars there and another 5 stars to the staff. We made a reservation, seated quickly and taken through the menu. Drinks and waters were kept fresh and anything that was needed or anticipated was provided.  Bacon bread in the bread basket?!? Died and went to heaven.  We ordered to start 2 orders of Mac & cheese with lobster, octopus and watermelon salad. Yelpers all raved about the Mac & Cheese so I figured it was a sure win....salt overload which everyone commented on, lost some points there. The octopus was tender and perfectly cooked and the watermelon heirloom tomato salad was refreshing and a welcomed flavor after the salt from the bacon bread and Mac & Cheese.  One rib eye ordered with a side of fries- huge portion but over cooked. One chicken dish ordered, a little on the dry side and again a bit salty but incredibly tasty. Halibut - most raved about it and thought it was light and delicate, where another's opinion felt it tasted frozen. Salmon was reportedly Delish.  Other dishes ordered but not memorable.  This group of 6 dined at a number of places in one weeks time and the Barrymore was the only one with mixed reviews.  Will I return....yes! Will I take out of town guests or clients here....probably not. The mixed reviews and the saltiness of the food apparently isn't for everyone.",

    "text": "Ok, so Yelp might have oversold me a bit on the burger :)  It was a very good burger - lots of flavors going on with the steakhouse toppings. But when I order it medium, and my friend orders medium rare, you'd expect to see at least a _little_ pink on one of the plates... still, maybe a 3.5 star burger.  The lobster deviled eggs were the highlight, a solid 4 stars (I'd have loved to have seen some chunks of lobster in them!) but the flavors were great.  The lower points included us having a reservation at 10:30am (yes, early lunch, but I had to get my friend to the airport right after and this place just got such amazing reviews, I thought it'd be a nice place for her last meal here). Now, I got the reservation on Opentable, but their own website says they open at 8am, yelp says they open at 8am, and opentable gave me a 10:30 reservation. We show up right on time, but they don't actually open til 11. They were apologetic, and were trying to get things going for us faster, but still, for a nice place in Vegas, I'm used to getting at least a little something for being inconvenienced like that --- an offer for a drink or an app for the table would have won them an extra star, but alas.  And by the end of the meal, our drinks had been long empty as we were given the check.... and still no refills... There are only 9 tables in the place, a little more attentive service would have been nice, and might have bumped it up to 4 stars, too.  I will probably go back - I didn't get to try the mac and cheese (!), but it won't be top of my list for impressing an out of town guest.  Decor is excellent though - nice ambiance if you can get a table.",

    "text": "I'm going to be honest, very few places that I attend on a Groupon are repeats (well, unless another Groupon or or discount becomes available). Under those circumstances I'm usually going based on price more than anything else.  One of the few exceptions to that rule is The Barrymore. I went there with my wife on a Groupon and we liked the place so much, we had our second anniversary dinner there.  Admittedly, I haven't tried a lot of the menu. On both occasions I had the lamb (which is my favorite lamb dish in town). The mac and cheese is very good and I enjoyed the frog legs as well. Finally, their deserts are, in my opinion, just the right size to close a meal and each one has been a treat.  They also have bacon cherry bread. This stuff is great. If you go, have it and then have some more.  The interior has a nice old-school look to it and our service has been very nice both times. It's not crowded and parking is never an issue at the Royal Resort either.  About the only negative I can give the place is the view is pretty bad. On my first visit my wife and I joked about it with the waiter since we had a window seat. On our second trip, we noticed that the windows were covered and I have some feeling that's why.",

    "text": "Holy crap!  It is so awesome when you find a place and are completely taken by surprise and blown away at the amazingness it has.  The Barrymore is that place!  We went here for our 2-year wedding anniversary, wanting to go to a nice and fancy place without breaking the bank.  When my husband said it was in the Royal Resort, I said, \"Where the hell is that?\"  Now, when you go to this place, don't let the odd location scare you off.  Just go with it; trust me!  Styling...let me set the scene for you: Old, vintage, 1920s Hollywood glamour.  Very cool and chic.  We were seated immediately and noticed there was a TV showing a football game.  A couple of minutes later, the TV was switched off and it turned into a mirror!!!  It was the coolest freaking thing I had ever seen.  The bar area is nice and spacious.  They have an outdoor patio with a really cool fire wall display.  Perfect place to snuggle up to your loved one.  Food: Delicious.  The portions are tinier than what I imagined, but the food is so rich and yummy, that it works.  For an appetizer, we had a type of veal carpaccio-ish dish that was spot on.  Oh, and I can't forget about the bread.  One of the types in the basket has bacon in it!  And the crispy cracker one is peppery.  I had the seared ahi for an entree which is served with a creamy polenta.  My husband had the short rib which was soooo tender.  For dessert, we had the cheesecake, and the chef was on Top Chef: Desserts, so you know it was good.  Drinks: They've got the handcrafted-putting-weird-stuff-like-marmalade-in-your-alcohol drinks going on here.  I like that kind of stuff.  I really enjoyed the Barrymore 75, which came in a huge glass (nice!) and the basil drink.  Best part...2 drinks, an app, 2 entrees, and a dessert came to only $100!!  This place is going to be huge!  Go now before people find out about it and gets too crowded!!",

    "text": "Maybe this place was a bit too old school for me and my usual dining companion. The service was generally pretty good so that's a plus. I started with the foie gras which was decent, but not worth the asking price in comparison to what I have had elsewhere for the same price. I ordered the salmon and my dining companion ordered the chicken (she never orders chicken, but it looked good on the menu). The salmon dish was generally ok. However...the skin on the salmon wasn't crispy. Why serve salmon with the skin in such a prevalent position if it isn't crispy? It's not that difficult of a cooking process. The chicken was a bit bland for us but the other parts of that particular dish were pretty good. We also ordered the mojito on the menu and a manhattan. The mojito was pretty good...but the manhattan was kind of awful. It was super sweet and tasted almost like it was straight vermouth. I intentionally tried to order something classic since this place isn't super modern and it ended up being a huge cocktail fail. Should I have said something? If it was just the 2 of us I probably would have...but it would have kind of ruined our party's atmosphere I think. On top of that, they charged me 17 for this terrible manhattan (and I didn't even request a specific liquor...so I think they upcharged something without asking).   I can't say that I really understand the high reviews for this place. Maybe it is appealing to a different demographic than me. It is one thing to go to an experimental restaurant and have some culinary duds, but at a place that tries to be so classic and charge so much, you either execute the classics well or you are going to fail in this day and age.  The rest of the party generally seemed to enjoy things though so that's always good.",

It's located inside a small hotel and with a not so appealing outside. Do not let this stop you from checking this place out. Trust me!  When I walked in The Barrymore I was stoked--\"I found a gem and I know I won't be let down!\" Immediately to my right was an old school Vegas lounge singer and his piano man. I kid you not, the singer said, \"I'm here every night except next Friday. I'm taking my girlfriend out.\" It was such a cliche lounge singer statement, but it worked!  We were seated in their very cozy, intimate main dining room. Our waiter promptly greeted us. The Barrymore has a very impressive wine list. I opted for a glass of \"The Whispering Angel\" rose and found to be light and satisfying.   We were served with a basket of freshly baked breads and warm salted butter. The breads were so delicious the basket was empty before we knew it. With great will power we declined a second basket. We choose all items suggested by our waiter. We had scallops for our appetizer....halla! The scallop appetizer was something to write home about! yum! yum! Our main entrees: bone in filet and chilean sea bass. Both items were good, but I must say they were a bit on the over cooked side--not too much, but just enough to notice.   For desert we got the apple cheesecake tart thingy. Perfect size! We were super stuffed, but wanted to experience all courses offered. Another great suggestion from our waiter.   I can't say enough good things about the staff. They made us feel welcomed and they cared about our experience. It wasn't just our waiter checking on us, even other waiters asked us with enthusiasm if we enjoying our dinning experience.   I can't wait to go back. The Barrymore is a really cool place.",

He stated that the $35 corkage fee would be waived if a bottle of champagne was purchased. Since he was going to waive it we thought why not, let's celebrate with a bottle of Rose!  There was 13 of us ordering from Sea Bass, Foie Gras, Lobster Tail, Steak, and sides. I had the Sea Bass and Lobster Tail and both were blah. The Lobster Tail was not tender, juicy or cooked well. The Brussel Sprouts were a little too salty for my taste! For 13 people, it is a lot of people to handle and a lot of food to cook but the service was very slow. So slow I ate so much bread to hold myself over. The dinner was close to 3 hours cutting close to our evening plans. We asked for the check and mentioned we were short on time. Instead of speeding it up Daniel decides to cut out giving us the cake and offer the dessert menu... which is the whole purpose why we were dining there! Instead he just brings us the check... Speeding up does not mean the end! When we asked about dessert and cake, Daniel said he didn't go through the dessert because we were in a rush. I guess when you say \"We're in a hurry, it means just cut to the chase...! Not sure why it translated that way!  Here comes more problems! When the bill finally came the $35 corkage fee was charged. We asked and he said, \"I said if you get a few bottles. You guys only ordered 1 bottle of Rose.\" We told him that's not was said and asked for the Manager immediately.  Paul, the Manager, said \"Daniel would not have said that because he has no authority to waive the fee.\" WOW! What happened to apologizing and customer service? Regardless, for 13 people to pay the $35 is NO BIG deal but it comes down to the principal. Don't say it and when addressed argue with the customers with no apology! On top of that what is $35 to the restaurant on a group of 13's bill?  Here's more... When he knew we wouldn't tip as much as they felt right they decided to add extra ($$$) to make up for the lack of tip on a random credit card of their choice! Unbelievable!  This probably sounds like joke but it really is not! It really happened and is seriously outrageous!",

The food was perfect and full of flavor. The steak was so tender. It melted in our mouths. To make this place better the customer service was excellent. We had very polite servers and they were more than happy to keep us content. I will definitely be recommending friends and family here.",

    "text": "I just ate at The Barrymore in celebration of my friend's birthday. I picked this place based on the great reviews, and I have to say I was a bit skeptical as our cab driver pulled up to the Royal Resort Hotel (a hotel off the strip I had never heard of). With that said, the meal did not disappoint. The restaurant itself has a very cool ambiance and decorated quite classically--I'd venture to say that it doesn't really fit with that particular hotel.  We started off with the Diver Scallops and the Lobster Mac & Cheese. I didn't love the scallops, but not because they weren't tasty--I'm just not a big fan to begin with. I've had Lobster Mac many times before and it's usually delicious, how could those two things combined not be? This time was no different, I would highly recommend trying it, but make sure to split it so that you don't ruin your meal-- it's heavy.  Lastly, for entrees my friend and I split the Black Bass and the Short Rib per the recommendation of our server. The Black Bass was wonderful and a great alternative for someone who doesn't wish to order steak. The Short Rib was also very tasty, it easily pulled apart as it should, but I would have liked for it to be a little more juicy. With that said, the flavor was great and both entrees were very enjoyable.  The Barrymore is a great place to get a nice dinner that won't cost you an arm and a leg. Similar dinners directly on the strip could have easily cost twice as much. I'd highly recommend giving it a try if you're looking for upscale, quality food, and good service without having to blow all of your winnings in one place.",

    "text": "I had high expectations of this place because of the awesome reviews, and all of the Yelp pictures looked amazing so we were pretty stoked to finally check it out. Overall, it was just an 'okay' experience.  We did not get what we payed for, and believe me, we have no problem paying for good food. We ordered the pork belly and also the cream corn with lobster for appetizers. The pork belly was very flavorful but it was a bit salty. It only came with one slice. I couldn't taste the lobster in the cream corn. The cream corn lacked cream and flavor and was also a bit dried.  Our entrees did kinda make up for the appetizers. We got the bass and the duck. They kinda overdid the lemon on the bass but other than that it tasted pretty good. The duck was pretty good as well.   Out of everything, the service was probably the worst. It wasn't super busy at the time that we went. There were 3 different servers, and not one of them checked up on us throughout our dinner. No smiles and just kept walking past us. They never filled up our waters. They never offered a dessert menu. Seemed like they didn't wanna be there. I did notice that it was the same service for the tables next to us as well so it wasn't just us. If we're paying this much, I expect the service to be top-notch. I'm sure if we came on another day and there's different servers and if we ordered other items on the menu, we would have a better experience. Good to try once but because of the experience that we had, we won't be returning.",

    "text": "Don't believe the hype.   It's odd in Vegas when a restaurant reaches that underground prominence of hip factor. Foodies love it because it's actually good without trying too hard, it's not expensive, and no one really knows about it.  Similar to when the food trucks started out. I felt like one of the few and knew I had to try it. Groupon sealed the deal.  This restaurant had none of the pitfalls of other new restaurants: No mass hoards of people, no terrible service, no huge waits, not even cold butter and hard bread or the usual \"we'll be back once they settle in\".   In other words: The restaurant was as it should be.  Why 3 stars? The whole app list was shellfish & fish intensive- 8/10 apps. I like apps to see what the restaurant can do creatively on the cheap.  No such luck. The entrees all sounded the same, so much so, the only item worth choosing was the SteakBurger. A burger at dinner, the Horror, I know.  The frisee on the burger gave it a bitter taste, the onion marmalade gave it a sweet taste and the gruyere gave it a musty taste. It was just not doing it for me.  When people say English Muffin bread you think the b-fast toast, but it's closer to a warm Foccaia type softness and airiness. Overall, this burger was a conundrum.  The dessert list (all $8.50) actually had apple pie with sorbet on top! That didn't even read right. We got ricotta cheesecake, which, read better than it looked. A half-circle of cheesecake with a sprinkling of graham cracker crumbs on top served on the cheapest of plates.   Quaint dining room, stellar service, but throw darts at the menu when choosing because I'm sure it's all good.",

    "text": "The Barrymore came recommended for dinner from our girlfriend who has wanted to try this restaurant out as well.  Making a reservation was very simple and when you pull up the outside definitely does not match the inside.  The restaurant is in a resort used, I believe, as time shares.  Once you walk in you feel like you are in a very hip...very upscale spot.  Once you take the corner to the seating area it's a whole new vibe.  It's very Mob sexy with an old \"Casino\" vibe.  I couldn't stop looking around because of how well put together it is.  The decor was by far the highlight of my night.  I was already hungry so everything on the menu was looking amazing.  The Foie Gras was sold out so I was a little sad.  My boyfriend and I decided to share the lobster and steak because it was recommended for two by our server.  Our girlfriend got the sea bass.  We ordered a bottle of wine and a cocktail.  When our server came back to the table he asked to take our order...AGAIN.  When we told him he was just at our table he apologized.  He brought over water 10 minutes later.  When he came back with our bottle of wine and asked if we knew about the dinner specials this evening...that he already went over when he took our food order.  When our dishes finally came he decided to ask us to move our plates and glasses that he sat down to lay the tray with the lobster tails and our steak.  It was very awkward and weird.  If your surf and turf platter is bigger than the actual table you may want to evaluate your dishes...or a pop up tray to sit between us.    Our steak was requested medium rare and was presented well done.  Not a big issue for us but when you charge as much as they do and there are literally only 10 tables in the restaurant it shouldn't be an issue.  Meat on both lobster and steak were dry and appetizer portion.  Our girlfriend's sea bass on the other hand was amazing which priced less than my she crab soup.  When the bill came it was a bit overpriced for the service and quality of food.  I get what they are trying to do and I applaud them but for amateur service and not a great portion or quality of food I would have rather spent $500 for three people somewhere else.",

You can't help but \"ooo\" and \"ahh\" over the decor that includes chi-chi wallpaper, deep dining booths with golden eagles on each end and a ceiling lined with golden, classic antique movie reels.  As the other reviews state, the lobster deviled eggs and the lobster mac & cheese with truffle oil are a must. I even tried what was thought to be a simple shrimp cocktail but in reality was a colossal appetizer fit for a meal.  The service is supreme and the adult libations will surely take you back to the classier times of Las Vegas.",

The restaurant is located in the small and old hotel but don't judge the outside.  The inside is totally different story.   Very classy decor, live music and romantic set up.    Everyone was so professional, welcome and friendly, even the valet guy.    Appetizer:  Roasted Artichoke - Very good.  Good Flavorful Endive & Green Apple Salad - All ingredients were very fresh.  Entree:  Roasted Black Bass - So good.  The fish was fresh and buttery.  The sauce was flavorful.   Roasted duck breast and confit leg - Very good.  The duck was tender and flavorful.    We also split the cream corn & Lobster - It was good also.  The sauce was creamy and rich.  Did not really taste lobster but the corn was very sweet.  For dessert, we shared a caramel apple cheesecake mousse.  Nice presentation.  The cheesecake was so good.  Smooth and rich but not overly sweet.  I also got a cocktail with a cool name, The Porn Star.  It was Pomegranik Vodka, pom juice, Cointreau, sour, lemon twist.  Very tasty.  I liked it.  If you want to look for a quiet romantic dinner that stays away from the strip, The Barrymore is a very good choice.",

Even the guy who brought the dishes and cleared the table was super polite!  The restaurant itself is pretty tiny hidden at the Royal Resort, which looks like an Inn converted to a boutique hotel.  The restaurant was dim inside with some nice paintings and decorations on the ceiling and wall.  Ordered a few drinks and picked out a bunch of appetizers and a main entree to share.  We could of ordered another main entree but the options for the appetizer were so appealing!  The heirloom beet salad with goat cheese and the Maine chilled lobster salad were delicious!  I also had to get my foie gras fix since I'm from Cali and it was seared nicely and had almost a breakfast feeling since it came with candied walnuts and sweet potato pudding.  We ordered the lobster mac and cheese but that came with our main dish which was fine!  I ordered the short rib which was glazed nicely with a red wine sauce!  The lobster mac and cheese was good but didn't have too much lobster flavor in it.  This meal was super rich!  But it was our last night in Vegas and we went out with a bang!  There was another guy who worked there who knew a lot about wines and alcoholic beverages.  This guy offered us a shot of Amaro Ciociaro and told us the story behind this Italian liqueur... supposedly helps with indigestion after eating a rich meal like we just did!  Overall I would totally recommend this restaurant to my friends... a place you can go off the strip but have a fabulous meal without paying the Las Vegas strip prices!",

Our server Juan was excellent, attentive and happy to answer any questions we had. We ordered several items to share and all was delicious (panzanella, arancini, sweetbreads, and more!).

We ordered filets across the board and everyone commented how the filets here were just as good, if not better, than any of the \"fancier\" restaurants in Las Vegas.  Appetizers were excellent -- we shared the grilled octopus, the caesar salad and the baby iceberg.  And don't tell anyone in California, but we also had some foie gras which was delicious.  Drinks were excellent both at dinner and at the bar.  I'd recommend the Manhattan or the Vesper.  Our waitress was fantastic.  Attentive without being over-bearing, and with a quirky sense of humor.

Our server was very good and very responsive to our requests. The pre-dinner bread was tasty, we both especially liked the warm pretzel bread. I ordered the NY Strip and my fiancee had Scallops. Her scallops were very good and the Strip had good flavor and the proper temperature. It may be personal preference but I was disappointed with the Mac N' Cheese side and the bearnaise sauce that I ordered to accompany my steak. Like most steak restaurants, dinner for 2 including cocktail and wine was over $200. I would dine at the Barrymore again, although I don't think it is my favorite steak restaurant in Vegas right now.",

What I liked:  The small and intimate setting. The attentiveness of our waitress Kendra. The brief visit by the GM Chad. The beer selection was great. I had one from Canada that had a picture of a horse on fire on the label. The caesar salad was perfect. The stone crab was excellent. The NY Strip was absolutely perfect. Cooked exactly how I ordered it. My wife ordered the short ribs and she liked it.  I had no expectations coming here but they hit it out of the park last night. I tell my wife often that its not about the money, its about the experience. This will certainly go down as a memorable evening, and we will return.   On a side note. I grew up in Iowa and I used to get killer steaks at the grocery store all the time. Having been in Las Vegas for over 10 years, I find the quality of meat here is inconsistent even at the nice steakhouses. Just because it is expensive doesn't mean it will be a good cut of meat. The steak I had here ranked among the best I've ever had. I'm surprised because I didn't get the impression they were known as a steakhouse. All the food was great, you can tell they put a lot of effort into the details. You will have a great experience here!!",

Indeed the atmosphere is \"romantic\", but the foods are disappointing given their price and the service is terrible (maybe the waiter try to be \"cool\"). Very superficial and overpriced place, not worthy to waste your money when there are so many nice choices in Vegas.",

    "text": "Although I was here months ago for the Yelp Elite Event - LV Confidentail, I had to return once as a standard patron to properly assess this establishment.  Yes, I was still impressed.  The bartender who was working upon my arrival was also the manager on shift, yet proceeded to talk about great classic cocktails and variants of such that intrigued me.  I enjoyed a couple unique Old Fashions and then proceeded to dinner.  The layout of the restaurant is ideal for someone who enjoys watching others interact.  Sitting in one of the half-round booths lining each wall of the rectangular room and all facing the center, one (or more) can gaze upon the other diners and ponder the situations in your imagination.  First dates?  Romantic rendezvous?  Scandal?  Probably a little of each, or maybe none at all, but the atmosphere and the setting lends your mind to wander.    The waiter comes to the table and presents a highly skilled rendition of the scripted dinner options for the evening, and hits every bit word on the spot.  Wine recommendations come quickly and, as far as I know, knowledgeably.  He could offer me Julio & Gallo and I'd be none the wiser.  I stick with my cocktails.  Food came timely, presented artistically, and prepared deliciously.  I would have had 2nds of everything.  The best part comes when the bill arrives and is surprisingly 1/2 of what I had expected to shell out for the evening.  Voila!  More funds for the next stop, just up the road, which I mentioned in a previous review.  Where was that tux again?....",

We grabbed seats at the bar and were promptly greeted by the bartender Jesus.  They had an impressive list of cocktails, wines and beers.   After a couple of drinks, we ordered a few lite bites, including Lobster Mac & Cheese, Watermelon Carpaccio, Pan Seared Foie Gras and the Roasted Artichoke.  The Roasted Artichoke in one word - AMAZING!  And be sure to try the bacon cherry bread when they bring out the bread basket.    Since it was my first time in, I took a quick tour of the whole restaurant and it had great ambiance and decor throughout.  They also have a great outdoor area which I look forward to visiting often when it cools down a little. The delicious food, great ambiance, and friendly staff will keep me coming back. Can't wait to introduce this place to my local and visiting friends :)",

For entrees we had Chilean sea bass and European sea bass. The European sea bass was nearly flavorless.  The Chilean sea bass was very tasty. My major fault with our dinners was portion size.  The appetizers  were very small. One octopus leg/tentacle. Three small pieces of crab. The sides with the entrees were skimpy.  A tiny bit of risotto with the Chilean sea bass.  We had good service but in my opinion the value was a little lacking.",

    "text": "Oh, man, my boyfriend and I loved this place! We had a fabulous dinner here for an amazing price in December and we loved every minute of it. Before we even got there we were waiting in the cab line at our hotel and the man there asked us, \"Where to?\" When we told him the Barrymore he said he loved it and that we would have an amazing dinner. He was absolutely spot-on.  When we arrived, we were both surprised that the restaurant is actually not huge. And I was a little nervous going into the lobby that maybe we didn't choose the right place --it was Sunday night and there weren't many people around--but we had an amazing time. We were seated more or less right away so we didn't get a chance to hang at the restaurant bar but maybe next time.  I love the decor of this place -- like everyone says, it's very old-Las Vegas. The booths are really big and really make this place. We sat at a table and our waitress was absolutely lovely. Very attentive and wonderful talking with us about the food. I had their version of a moscow mule to start and it was big! Copper mug and everything, I was happy!  The three-course dinner was so reasonably priced we just had to go with it, and we did the wine pairings as well. With my mule I started out with a good amount to drink! But the wines were great with each course and the food was excellent.  We don't go to Vegas much, so I imagine when we come back we'll try to visit somewhere different to get a little more variety, but it actually makes me a bit sad--I'd love to return to the Barrymore! If you're on the fence about choosing this restaurant -- just go, you won't regret it!",

Main Course:  Mediterranean Sea Bass - I almost licked the plate because not only it was good but the fish was very very tiny. The mashed potatoes sort of camouflaged it to make it look big.   Rib Eye - it was good and well seasoned. My bf asked for medium-rare, it came out medium-well.  The creme brulee was the highlight of the night since it was free and the most delicious. It had some pears and a scoop of ice cream. I almost licked the plate.   We will be back!",

Come to think of it, we also had a grilled octopus which, even to my taste buds, were amazing !  The restaurant is attached to a very quirky hotel next door but the interior and patio decor is really nice and chic. The cool thing about going that night was that there was one large family there, a small girl group and us. It was quiet, intimate, and everything seemed perfect. Will definitely be bringing my family here next time they come visit Vegas !",

    "text": "Las Vegas has its share of steak houses both on and off the strip. Who would have thought a restaurant inside of a hotel in the shadow of the Encore would offer such a perfect meal.  The Barrymore is located in the Royal Resort, just off the strip and near the convention center. Parking is available in the side of the building with more available in the back. With movie themed decor such as some paintings and gold reels on the ceiling it offers a different vibe than most.  18 oz dry aged bone in ribeye. I ordered the crab oscar style, medium rare. Cooked just as I ordered it this steak had perfect flavor and the right amount of crab on top to cover each bite.  Roasted Brussel sprouts with smoked bacon. The chunks of bacon made this dish. I like my sprouts a bit more cooked, my preference but the bacon itself stole the show here   Twice baked potato with truffle. The truffle was hard to find in this but the potato itself was creamy, cheesy and flavorful  Chocolate layer cake. Accompanied with ice cream, chocolate clusters and chocolate sauce this was a perfect ending to our dinner  Service! Louis took great care of during our visit. Explaining how each of our courses are prepared and topped with, keeping our glasses full for the duration and making sure we enjoyed every minute of our anniversary  dinner he went above and beyond what we expected. You get a free glass of wine with a Yelp check in and there are specific one you get, he gave me one that wasn't on that list and he certainly didn't have to",

    "text": "The Barrymore is reminiscent of the old days of Vegas, when steakhouses were cheap and the dining rooms were filled with cigar smoke. In reality, the steakhouse is relatively new and reimagined in the early part of this decade. Found within the Royal Resort next to the Convention Center, it's known for its signature cocktails and reasonably priced steak. This spot has been on my radar since I've been trying to make my rounds at all the Vegas steakhouses.  As my parents were in town, I thought they would absolutely love this place. Their visit also happened to coincide with restaurant week, which featured many items from their regular menu. Appetizers included the escargot, smoked bacon, and the grilled octopus ceviche. The escargot had quite a unique presentation with the snails presented inside potatoes that served as cups and lathered in garlic butter. The plating felt so outdated and tacky. As with most escargot, garlic butter dominated the rubbery texture of the snail. I was pleasantly surprised by how tender the octopus was. Paired with the mango salsa and plantain chips, the ceviche was my favorite of the three. The smoked bacon was just that - very smokey in flavor. If you're a fan of thick, center-cut bacon, this is for you.   For entrees, the main courses featured either the wagyu flat iron steak, the surf, surf, & surf, which had their Chilean sea bass, grilled shrimp, and a lobster tail, or the Dean Martin, which had an 8 oz. filet mignon and roasted bone marrow in place of the fish and shrimp. The wagyu flat iron had an amazing flavor and I loved the Argentinian rub and chimichurri sauce. The filet lacked the flavor of the wagyu flat iron, but it did come with a bearnaise sauce. My favorite of the evening was the Chilean sea bass. It had a perfect sear and the flakes of fish were huge. Portions for all the entrees were generous. My least favorite of the protein was actually the lobster tail. I found it to be overcooked and too rubbery in texture.   Dessert featured a classic chocolate layer cake with vanilla ice cream and a cheesecake coupe, a deconstructed cheese cake with brown butter streusel and orange cremeux. A piece of white chocolate sat atop the cup and melted as the server poured warm strawberry sauce over the dessert for presentation. Dinner was wonderful and I came away stuffed. I didn't even mention the assortment of freshly baked breads including a pretzel roll, ciabatta, and a Parmesan crisp. Their cocktail menu features many signature libations including their best known cocktail, The Barrymore, which is jack, blood orange liqueur, orange bitters, vermouth, orange marmalade, and orange zest. The prominent flavor, as you can imagine, is orange. If you enjoy cheap house wine, check-in on Yelp gets you a free glass of wine.",

The atmosphere and set up was beautiful- perfect for a date night or a special night out. Our server, Ingrid, was wonderful. She was very sweet and attentive. The food was also amazing. The wagyu steak was one of the best steaks I've had! Would also highly recommend trying the oysters rockefeller for a happy hour appetizer - they were out of this world.

The Bacon slice was tasty and the sides of corn and spinach were decent, but my wet aged ribeye was a little too blackened and a bit overdone for medium rare. My co-diners also found the octopus app a little dry. I will also add that our servers were very friendly and attentive.",

Everything was tasty and our server was really kind, friendly and attentive. That year I had a party of 13 and everything was great. Since that dinner went so well I decided to go back the next year but I wasn't so lucky. Unfortunately two out of the ten people in our party was running late. Everyone else was ready to order however the server would NOT allow us to order without them. So once the other two arrived we were able to order. The food was really good and the steaks were all cooked to perfection. The manager also sent out a little birthday dessert which was nice. The only issue was the service. For whatever reason our server was very short and quick with us.   Quick summary: The food here is delicious but the service is hit or miss. There's lots of parking and its not a far walk. Would I going back next year for my dinner? NOPE! Would I go for happy hour and eat possibly eat at the bar? Sureeee why not.",

Once you step in, you feel like you've been transported to a different time, and that time is the days in the 60's where stars like Sinatra dominated the Las Vegas strip.   The food is pretty decent, but expect to spend a little bit extra. Compared to its value, I would say the food hits the mark. I mentioned my check in with Yelp and they were nice enough to provide me and my guest with two glasses of wine instead of just one.   Service was great, they were professional and everything I expected.",

    "text": "We came out to The Barrymore last night for a friend's 30th birthday.  She did a simple search of \"Unique Places to eat in Las Vegas\" and this was highly recommended.  The Barrymore is a great little steakhouse, just off the strip, in a little hotel that I'd never heard of before.  It was, admittedly, a little hard to find at first, but once we realized that it was inside the hotel, it was smooth sailing.   The atmosphere here is old, swanky Vegas.  The room was beautiful, with what looked like old movie reels on the ceiling, and a glass case (of emotion) of wine opposite our table.    I love places that have a Yelp Check In perk, and The Barrymore gives you one free glass of wine with your check in!  The Cabernet is WONDERFUL.  I was very pleased with my selection.   Last night, we didn't do a \"family style\" per se, but I was able to taste a bunch of the sides, and other food.   Can I talk about the bread basket?  Mini baguettes, pretzel rolls, and the most awesome...I never remember the proper name of the big \"cracker\" like bread/toast things, but...YUM!!!  We devoured both bread baskets in record time.  My husband and I ordered:   The Chilean Sea Bass with butternut squash risotto (for me):  AMAZING.  The risotto was decadent.  The Sea Bass was cooked to perfection, and the portion size was perfect...not too much, and not too little.  I was SO thrilled with this choice.    The Berkshire Pork Chop (for my husband):  I had a bite, and this was really yummy!  Cooked really well, and paired with grapes and roasted Brussels sprouts, he was a happy camper.   The Lobster Mac and Cheese:  Meh....it was ok, but not as amazing as I was hoping.  The lobster was great, but I'd have liked the mac n cheese to have been a bit more creamy.   Not my favorite, but it was still good.    I sampled from my friends: The Pan seared foie gras:  SO delicious.  The fig and cherry compote with the pain perdu, and port reduction...wonderful.  Just wonderful.    The filet mignon:  I had a bite of my friend's steak, and it was perfection.  Beautifully charred on the outside, perfect mid rare inside...mmmm.  Really good.   Mashed potatoes: really nice.  Smooth, and creamy.  Seafood Platter:  This was the best seafood platter I've ever seen.  Oysters.  A WHOLE lobster.  Crab claws.  Ahi poke.  And 8-10 of the biggest jumbo shrimp I've ever seen.  I tried the oysters and the shrimp:  both were wonderful.  By the way my friend was hoarding the crab claws, those must have been incredible too.  Fella said that the lobster was amazing, as was the ahi.    All in all, we had a truly enjoyable evening.  Service was top notch.   And I do mean TOP notch.    Monday nights are industry nights, so we enjoyed 50% off food, which was absolutely incredible.    Well done, Barrymore.  You are going high up on my list of spots to recommend.  We'll be back soon.",

Mgr apologized and comped us desserts for our trouble.  Apps- had the DIVINE bone marrow with onion jam, calamari with a Serrano fruit glaze (good but not a standout), lobster Mac & cheese (cheese sauce was excellent).   Wines by the glass and bottle -nice choices & fair priced).   Dry aged steaks were very good but mine was a bit overdone. Brussel sprouts were very good, mushrooms & fries nothing special.   Dessert was a nice chocolate stout cake, cheesecake with meringue & an AMAZING pistachio creme brulee.

The food in my opinion is just 'ok' for Las Vegas. My husband had a filet that was seasoned and cooked well but it was extremely tough. I ordered the wedge salad which was great!  I also ordered the foie gras and the brussel sprouts- both mediocre. My daughter got the Lobster Mac, mediocre as well-very bland.      I really wanted to like this place!  I've been to Vegas a few times and LOVE the dining options!  It's a family trip this go round (3 kids) so our dining options are scaled back a bit. This was great for the family and the service was awesome.",

Upon entering they were instantly happy. It is an intimate space with class and an old school vibe. While they were reviewing the menu they were happy to see a nice offering without feeling like they were being gouged. Service from Luis and Karla was attentive and personable without being intrusive. My father in law is not a drinker and has extreme dietary restrictions, they went above and beyond for him.   The personal touches are what made the experience worth writing about. It means a lot when the GM, Kirk, was on the floor touching base with all the guests in the venue. Corey, the bartender, had me try one of the new cocktails that will be featured on the new cocktail menu. It was called the \"Golden Globe\". It was a play on the dark and stormy but it was fresh and alive.   I find that when you go out there is always one person in the party that wishes they had ordered something else, but that was not the case at the Barrymore. I tip my hat to a venue that can pull that off.   I am happy in a city that has adopted a culture of not caring about the guest that there are places like the Barrymore. You will be seeing a lot of me for a long time to come!!!!",

We were there on a Monday night a week ago at approx. 8:30pm. There was only one other party dining during the time we were there. The service was prompt, manager and wait staff frequently checked on us. The pretzel rolls were yummy, good combination of soft/salty.   We started with the seafood platter and it was fresh, seafood seemed to be good quality. Ordered Caesar salads and while they were tasty, they seemed a little overdressed. For mains, we both had bone in ribeyes - they were great. Chargrilled and tender. The baked potatoes were tasty with sour cream, chives and bacon. Good pour on the wine. My only regret was that I was SO full, I had to forgo dessert.",

We skipped appetizers thinking we would get dessert, and ordered filets, and shared sides of cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts. I also ordered a passion fruit and Prosecco cocktail which was delicious...in fact it was difficult to choose a cocktail, the Girl Next Door martini with pickle stuffed olives was calling my name, but I had a few glasses of sparkling wine earlier in the evening and found it wise not to deviate.   Our steaks came out perfectly medium rare, and the sides were excellent. I love roasted cauliflower and the pine nuts and raisins were a perfect touch. We ended up being too full for dessert, but the choices all looked delicious!  I loved the interior, really great place for date night or ladies night, the outdoor patio, while a little small, was super cute too. We both agreed we would be back, and add it to our list to take out of town guests. Excellent!",

I ordered the Vadouvan Squash--squash, root vegetables in a rich curry with couscous.  It was good, but I would have liked a bit more curry flavor to the dish.    After dinner, the server brought us a complimentary plate of miniature macarons.  It was a tasty ending to the meal.  Service was good.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh one when I got low on the first one.  Water glasses were refilled.  Our server was super about 5 people paying with cash and credit cards.    The room was very loud when we first arrived at 7:30, but quieted down as some of the diners left.  I like the film reels on the ceiling in going with their Barrymore theme.  I think the place is a bit overrated.  I don't think I'd make a return visit.  The prices don't justify what you get.",

The restaurant is located just off the lobby area and it too was pretty desolate on a Saturday around noon. I understand since this is mainly known as a dinner location, so I gave them a pass there.   The hostess greeted us warmly and seated us in the side dining area. There are three areas for dining, the main room, the outside area and the side area. The decor is delightful. I love the retro Hollywood feel.   Our server was fantastic. He was very welcoming and friendly. He made recommendations and was very warm and conversational, telling us all about the restaurant and insisting on taking us on a tour of the other dining rooms after our meal. My fella and I started with the lobster mac n cheese and also got the steak frites and the steakhouse burger. The flavors were fantastic. Both of our entrees had slightly too many carmelized onions on them for my taste, but the meals were great. Our favorite dish was definitely the lobster mac n cheese. The flavors were phenomenal. We were literally licking the bottom of our bowl. The burger and steak sandwich were great as well. The bun wasn't my favorite so I ate the burger and toppings on their own.   After our meal, we were taken on the promised tour of the restaurant and I was utterly impressed with the fantastic service at the Barrymore. I can't wait to return to try all that their dinner menu promises. Love this place.",

We were seated inside the dining room and I immediately loved the place. The Retro Old School Vegas vibe really intrigued me. Surrounded by mirrored walls and movie film reels on the ceiling, dark curtains and plush booths, we both really liked the vibe.   Our server, Kendra, was eager to offer her suggestion on cocktails, after what we told her what we liked, she had suggested a jalepeno infused watermelon martini for myself and a sazerac for my friend. Both drinks were delicious.  Bread basket came out and I immediately spotted the pretzel roll. I love a good bread basket and this one did not disappoint.   We started out with 1/2 dozen of Kumiai Oysters that were the special that day, I'm mad I've never had this oyster before! They were really good.   Special of the day was John Dory fish, again I had never even of this fish, so I decided to try it. My friend ordered Bone In Ribeye. My fish was very mild, it was cooked perfectly. My friends Ribeye was the table favorite. We learned the grill master has been at it for 20 years, and it shows. Steak was tender and juicy.   We shared the famous Lobster Mac & Cheese, it's as good as it sounds.   Unfortunately we were too full to try dessert. Next time.  They have a courtyard with a fire pit, it's the perfect time of year for outdoor dining. I really enjoyed this place, I can't say enough about the service as well, Kendra was great. I can't wait to come back and try more menu items.",

    "text": "My score: 4.5 stars.  At long last! I finally tried The Barrymore.  Because I had waited so long, I felt I needed the full experience.  My group started with drinks at the bar.  Service was excellent even if the beer menu left a lot to be desired.  We opted to eat in the dining room instead of on the patio so we wouldn't be sweating our nuts off while we were trying to look classy.  Will definitely be back to try the patio when it is cooler.  The dining room is small and intimate and nicely decorated.  Very old Hollywood.  Great date spot and I am sure our loud asses ruined a couple of dates that night.  We started with four appetizers (yeah, I said 4!): Lobster mac & cheese, fried artichokes, lobster deviled eggs and grilled octopus.  I hate mac & cheese but even I liked the lobster mac.  Was not a huge fan of the artichokes but the other 3 made up for it and my friend took care of the artichoke, which she loved.  It doesn't take much for me to love a deviled egg because, in general, deviled eggs are awesome, but this deviled egg really was something special.  Nice lobster flavor and a little dollop of caviar on each egg.  Way to high-class a redneck treat!  Since we had such a mammoth amount of appetizers, we opted to go straight to the main courses.  Two of us had filet mignons and 1/2 lobsters with all 3 of The Barrymore's signature steak sauces (my favorite was the Bernaise).  The lobster was a little overcooked but the steak was excellent and the drawn butter covered the lobster nicely.  I also had a bite of the short ribs and sea bass my friends ordered.  I would have gladly eaten either dish as my meal.  Both were great.  We also had two bottles of a really good Malbec (can't remember the name) and cashed in my Groupon.  All in all, a great atmosphere, very good food, great service and beyond reasonably priced.  You won't find a better meal at this price point anywhere in town.  Truly a hidden gem in the dumpy litte Royal Resort.",

But venturing outside the restaurant, you wonder how the Royal Resort is ever going to make it? The piano player in the lobby was so bad I can only surmise he was deaf. I think Motel Six has got this place beat on every count!  Anyhow, the restaurant is small and intimate.  The atmosphere is classy and romantic.   Now for the food. My tuna tartare was unique. I liked it but not sure I've ever had tuna tartare with a spicy kick. I'm quite positive I've never had tuna tartare accompanied by a fried avocado. My pork chop was overcooked and the blue cheese sauce simply overwhelmed it. Wish it wasn't so but it was. My wife's Sea Bass was outstanding. She way out ordered me! Her foie gras was average and the cream corn with lobster was neither creamed nor anything to write home about. The service was attentive and the staff was nice and accommodating.  I liked it okay, but I would not make a special trip to go back.  Slightly upturned face.",

There are so many dining choices in Las Vegas, with limited time this wouldn't make my top list. The ambience is old Vegas. It's intimate inside . You can roll the dice on this place and figure out if you like it or not if you want to go off the beaten path -literally and figuratively.",

We had a really tasty and reasonably priced bottle of wine, a a couple of steaks and the sea bass.  It was all really tasty.  The ambiance is a nice balance of old Las Vegas charm and hipster fun.

    "text": "If it wasn't for our server Daniel, it'd be a 2-star experience.  Service was excellent, I have nothing but great things to say about the service; unfortunately the food is lacking.  I ordered a steak tartare for starters.  It was ok; I was disappointed in the choice of using mayo instead of eggs, but that's not too much of a concern.  The divers' scallops were an issue.  They came out overcooked (it was rubbery in texture), I took one small bite (probably 20% of the medallion) and sent it back.  They had no issues with it.  What was the issue was that the second dish came out undercooked.  If I had to pick a poison, I'd pick the latter, which I ate; but the core of the medallion was luke-warm in temp at best.  I've cooked scallops that size; it ISN'T that hard to do to get em just right, and I'm not even the cook of my household.  I really hated to have to sent it back because it takes a while to grow scallops to the size of those things and now 1 if not  3 just got wasted for no reason.  The ox tail stew reminds me of some of the beef jerky I've had.  Way too salty, way too chewy.  My girlfriend ordered a \"crispy\" pork belly.  The skin wasn't crispy, actually according to her words no part of that meat was crispy at all.  The piece was too dry as well and not tender.  It was also overseasoned.  We went with our friends who recommended it.  I REALLY wanted to like it, because the service was absolutely excellent, but the food really left us disappointed.",

The interior was beautiful! I love the feeling of being in a decked out fine dining restaurant.  It almost set the mood as if to be in a Gatsby movie, very elegant.  The service was helpful, and the wine list couldn't have been better.  The Napa Cabernet by the glass is AMAZING! I will have to call and get the name for my own satisfaction but so smooth, the perfect wine.  We ordered some lobster Mac for the appetizer and it's safe to say it was a big hit at our table, the plate was basically spotless.  I don't usually comment on the complimentary breads but oh my, that had to be the best pretzel bread I've ever had! I ordered the free range chicken for my entree.  The food took about 40 min after ordering to be brought out to the table, I thought that was a bit long but the atmosphere was comforting enough to let it slide.  When my chicken came and I cut into the juicy breast, my taste buds went crazy! It was so delicious, my mouth is watering just reciting the memory! My husband got the New York steak, of course I had to try a piece and man was it charred to perfection and so tasty! The Brussels sprouts with bacon we're great along with the asparagus, and the corn.  The mashed potatoes seemed a bit plain to me, but other than that the experience couldn't have been better! To finish off dinner we all split a lemon cheesecake that made your taste buds disregard the full stomach and dig in for more. I loved the experience, the boutique, elegant, Gatsby feel.  We'll be referring many friends and family!",

    "text": "The folks behind lbs, Holstein's and a few other of my top burger spots in town just opened up The Barrymore at the little-known Royal Resort just off the Strip, and I was more than excited to see what else they had in store for me. I've read a few things about the place since it opened, plus the pictures of the interior looked like my kind of spot so I really had some high hopes that I would be walking into my next go-to restaurant. All of these things surely added up to a great burger right? Not so much.  The restaurant itself has a great interior; contemporary, hip, kind of reminds me of the Vintner Grill but maybe a little fancier. There is a really small bar at the front, and I think two different dining rooms, seating a total of only 50 people I think so reservations are probably recommended. The Royal Resort is pretty cool as well, the lobby could still use a bit of work with their ceiling tiles for example, but I'm sure the average person won't notice this.  The menu looks great, I would definitely go back to try many of the items that sounded delicious, but as usual I'm there for only one thing. I did manage to sneak in the lobster mac & cheese before the burger came out; it was decent but not amazing for $13. I've also heard from many people that they have a fantastic cocktail menu which I wasn't totally in the mood for on this visit but would definitely be willing to go back for.  The Steakhouse Burger on the menu is listed as grass-fed beef patty, bacon marmalade, gruyere cheese, frisee, oven-roasted tomatoes and garlic aioli. That's quite a lot of flavors packed into one assembly, and I was almost nervous as to whether all of those would be able to stand out or if some would overpower the others. The burger came out with a very strange looking bun, and pinned with a wooden steak with the lbs logo on it which I thought was odd, but made me even more excited because I haven't had a bad burger there yet. Maybe it's because we weren't actually at lbs but this wasn't up to par. The meat had good flavor, was definitely cooked medium-rare as ordered, but the toppings and bun added up to something just short of working for me. As predicted, I think the toppings all kind of got lost together, although if you isolated and pulled out individual bites of each they were quite good. The bacon marmalade was probably my favorite, and the bun really detracted from everything for me. The bun to meat ratio was ok, but the bun itself was very dry and just really odd. Overall it was ok, but not at all what I was hoping for.  The fries were good; they had a bit of seasoning and good flavor, and luckily were included with the price of the burger otherwise I'd say the $6 for a side order of them is a bit much. My friend ordered asparagus instead of the fries and we were sadly charged an additional $7. I understand that some menu changes come with an additional fee, but I wasn't too crazy about that line item on our bill even given the 'fanciness' of the restaurant. If we hadn't done any strange swaps, our meal would have come to $27 for the two burgers which isn't horrible given the location just off the Strip as well as the interior of the restaurant, unfortunately I thought the burger was just ok. My friend liked hers, but I thought it could be better. If you want to spend about the same on a really great burger I'd say go to Holstein's if you're on the strip or lbs if you're out in the suburbs. But if you want to check out a really cool looking restaurant and eat some other great food definitely check this place out.",

I really wanted to like the place. I made a special request for a nicer table as we were celebrating my parents' wedding anniversary - The restaurant called a week before saying they made special arrangements and got us a nice table on the patio. Great!  Well it turned out that the \"special arrangement\" was to accomodate a big group that took over the whole room on the night of our reservation. So nothing to do with my request, they just fooled us.  The young lady who placed us was obnoxious and unpleasant. On the other hand, our waitress was really nice and helpful.  I am putting 2 stars as the steaks we got (NY strip and T-bone) were very very good. The 35$ foie gras burger was a total disaster.  Definitely not worth the 25$ ride from the strip and freezing on the patio most of the time.",

If anyone has anything bad to say about this place they are completely stupid. I mean if they had bad service in the server that may be possible. But I've yet to experience that. But if anyone says anything bad about the food. They either have bad taste or just completely brain dead. This is definitely a hidden gem in Las Vegas. The food is just as good if not better than most of the steak houses in Las Vegas on the strip. If you want to place that is nice,  friendly,  fast service,  and a reasonable price for Las Vegas this is a place for you.",

The service was outstanding. The music and the decor remind you of the original Las Vegas, from the late 1950s to early 1960s. The food was simply outstanding. My wife and I shared the 18 ounce bone in ribeye. It was so good, that my wife literally picked up the bone and started gnawing on it like a rabid wolf. I'm not kidding. You should also try the lobster creamed corn. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. We have been to many of the high-end restaurants in Las Vegas, and the Barrymore competes favorably with all of them.",

Soon after we were seated \"our drinks\" arrived, how cool is that (not the arctic wind blasts) but that they could read my mind without taking my order first.  It actually took some more than necessary convincing before our waiter finally relented that we did not in fact order those drinks, nor had we ordered anything yet!  When our cocktails did arrive, the uneventful HillBilly beef brisket infused Bloody Mary was accompanied by a wedge of last week's dry and tired lime, The Lonnie martini was fortunately garnish-less and pleasant.  One of the things that generates a vast culinary sadness in me is an bad bread experience, and what arrived was a whole basketful of it.  What should have been delectable bacon & cherry bread, baguette slices and Parmesan crisps, were horrifically stale apparitions of their former selves. There is never an excuse for stale bread.  NEVER!  We had:  Lukewarm French onion soup, which was tasty, but not exceptional.    Free Range Chicken with mushroom risotto, nueske bacon, and baby mustard greens.  The chicken was overcooked and dry, the risotto was pasty and fair.  Short Rib Bourguignon. Meh.  We did not have:  The side dishes we ordered which never arrived.  For dessert we rushed to Trader Joe's to pick up some sweets to comfort ourselves at home.  There is just so much disappointment, mediocre food & poor service one can endure.",

I don't think too many people know that this place opens at 2:00 one day a year.  That was today, Thanksgiving, and it was the best Thanksgiving dinner my new mate and I ever had in our lives.

Like others have said, the outside of the hotel can kind of fool you... but the restaurant itself is pretty nice.  Hands down, their LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE is my favorite thing on their menu. It's only an appetizer and I only wish they had it as an actual entree. My boyfriend had the Short Rib Bourguignoni... I had the Muscovy Duck Confit... and we shared a side of the Cream Corn & Lobster. Everything we ordered for our meal was DELICIOUS... including the complimentary bread basket they give you.

Also, certain wines and beers also heavily discounted.  All prepared by a friendly bartender (Sarah).  Well worth it!  There is even a small outside patio for drinks.    Both dining rooms are comfy and inviting. We arrived at 5:30 PM without reservations and had no problem being seated in a huge booth. The food in the restaurant, while pricey, was great.  Everything from the bread basket to the side vegetables was delicious.  Steaks were tender and perfectly cooked.  The only caution is that they tend to over-salt the steaks, so on my next visit I will mention that to the server.  Speaking of the service, it was excellent.  Food was delivered quickly and the table was cleared in a timely manner.  Our server (Emily) was all smiles and very friendly.  In general, good service without a hint of stuffiness.",

On this last trip, for an appetizer, my Fiance and I had the Parmesan Arancini -  beef & tomato sugo, aceto balsamico and herbs. Little balls of deliciousness! Luckily there were 4, so we could split them and not fight over an odd number.  Their steaks are grass-fed, which is a major plus for my Fiance and I being on the paleo diet (even though we broke all the rules for this birthday dinner). I ordered the Filet, along with sharing mashed potato and asparagus sides.  And for desert I ordered the Warm Chocolate Cake (I'm a chocoholic) and my Fiance ordered the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. You can't go wrong with either!   Overall, this is my favorite dinner restaurant in town. Added bonus is that it's off the strip a little, so locals can miss all that traffic madness.",

Upon arrival, we were told that our reservation for 2 was not ready.  So we preceded to the bar for his beer and a glass of wine for me.  We waited about 30 minutes until our table was ready.    The restaurant was packed and had a romantic atmosphere.  I noticed that the service was incredibly slow.  I'm glad I didn't book show tickets because we had a 7:30 reservation, and didn't leave the restaurant until about 10 pm.  I didn't come here to rush, but I didn't expect to have to ask someone else to hunt our waitress down either.  We ordered the following: Lobster Mac & Cheese--Great! New York Strip--Great! Chicken--Meh! (the chicken and risotto just did not work together) Mashed Potatoes with Bacon--Good Broccolini--Good chocolate cake with a birthday candle--Booooo!  (The cake looked like a broke down cupcake.  It tasted good, gut it looked like CRAP!  Very disappointing for the grand finale.)  Overall, I would recommend the Barrymore if they are not crowded.  They definitely have friendly people working there, and have some tasty dishes if you choose well.  The prices are also a bargain compared to other places on the strip.",

Highly recommend getting the scallop entree and the duck confit entree. Both entrees were cooked to perfection. This place is a hidden jewel. It's a small restaurant but its worth the trip. We came pretty late to the restaurant but they still took very good care of us. Most of the time if you go to a restaurant late, they will cook the food real quick and so the customers could eat and leave as soon as possible. This wasn't the case, service was still good and food was still amazing. Well deserving of a five star. Kudos!",

    "text": "The restaurant is located in The Royal Resort. When you turn into the property from Convention Center Drive, there's a small parking lot next to the hotel. Then from there, it's a short distance to the restaurant.  We (there were six of us) went for a surprise birthday dinner for my best friend Randy. The interior, decor, and ambience is very cool. Beautiful too. We had a large half-circle booth with Randy at the head of the table in an extra seat and it was comfortable (the restaurant was a tad too warm, but it may have just been that evening).  We started with beers and their specialty cocktails. I had \"The Barrymore\" (Gentleman Jack, Solerno Blood Orange liqueur, orange marmalade, Cocchi Vermouth di Torino, orange bitters, and orange zest); very strong, but tasty. Everyone else really enjoyed their cocktails as well. I tried the others, but don't recall what they were!  For an appetizer, Ruben and I shared the \"Panzanella\" (marinated tomato, fried bread, cucumber, red onion, burrata cheese and banyuls vinaigrette). All the vegetables were fresh and delicious, loved the fried bread, and the vinaigrette was light with good flavor. Burrito cheese is something I have been raving about since I had it on a delicious pizza last Fall, however, I didn't really care for it on this dish. It was served as a huge chunk sitting in the center of the \"salad\" that you had to pull apart. It was awkward for me.  For entrees, Ruben had the \"Pan Roasted 'Jidori' Free Range Chicken\" (mushroom risotto, nueske bacon, and baby mustard greens), which he really enjoyed, and I had the \"Vadouvan Squash Curry\" (squash, root vegetables in a rich curry with moroccan-style couscous). I tried his mushroom risotto and it was delicious. I also really enjoyed my curry! Wonderful flavor with a lot of depth and the couscous was yummy. Randy ordered a Filet Mignon with a side of mashed potato - delicious! The filet was cooked PERFECTLY and the seasoning was great (he didn't even need to use the Bearnaise sauce he ordered). Also, the mashed potato was ridiculously creamy and flavorful. We ALL loved it.  For a birthday dessert, we ordered the \"Warm Chocolate Cake\" (praline fudge sauce, hazelnut brittle, milk chocolate sorbet) for Randy. Very good. I ordered the Tiramisu (mascarpone mousse, coffee-rum ladyfingers, caramel espresso biscotti). It was meh; the ladyfingers were dry for my liking and there was not nearly enough \"tiramisu\" flavor in the dessert.  We had a really nice experience from start to finish. The restaurant is relatively small with limited seating, so groups are restricted to 1.5-2 hour seatings (I believe). So, our post-dinner chat session was brought to a halt by the manager, however, they were kind enough to offer us a space in their lounge with a bottle of champagne. We declined since we needed to head out, but that was very thoughtful and well-strategized of them. All of us were very pleased and desire to return!",

The grilled octopus was really good too. 5 stars. The frog legs were ok. I would not get it again as it pretty much tastes like chicken. 4 stars.   For our main meal we got the bone-in rib eye and it was delicious. It was not as tender as i thought it would be but overall it was good. The one downside was the seasoning. They put something spicy in it. Maybe cayenne pepper? 4 stars. We also got the lobster. It was cheap and awesome. I would get it again and again. 5 stars. For a side we got the cream corn & lobster and we did not like it. We took one bite and did not try it again. It was overpowered with spices. 2 stars.   For dessert we got the creme brulee and it was good. They put a scoop of basil lime sherbet on top and i thought it was horrible. We just scooped it out and ate the creme brulee. 4 stars.   Would i go again? No because there are so many other restaurants to try in vegas. Would i recommend it to friends? Yes.",

The Barrymore seemed the right mix of good reviews, unique/stylish setting, and a menu that would appease a varied crowd. The outside has little bearing on what to expect once you enter The Barrymore proper.  Though small, the bar and dining room offer a lot of style points packed into your field of vision without being ostentatious or overly busy.  The service dragged at one point, but was overall commiserate with the price point - neither hovering or overly aloof.  The sommelier was also spot on, and offered a great selection off the modestly priced wine list. The not so good part, unfortunately, was the food.  In a word made up of two words: lackluster.  There was not one thing served that lived up to anything above a three star experience.  Both NY strips at the table were difficult to cut at times and nothing approaching what you'd expect at any steak house above a Salt Grass or Outback.  And in fairness to those establishments, I should say that I had no difficulty cutting the steak I've eaten there on rare occasions.  The Bearnaise ordered as an accompaniment did little to liven the affair, tasting of little more than a flat wine reduction. The lobster mac, which is by no means a unique item, fell equally flat.  The wallpaper should not appear richer than an item that practically screams \"ridiculous oozing opulence....with lobster!\"  But it did.  The salmon was cooked wonderfully and was considered a success, though it sat unfinished at the end of the meal.   Perhaps we missed the mark by not getting the bone-in ribeye and the sweetbreads instead, but it's only a guess that we'll return to see if lady luck rewards the brave, or further hinders the foolish.",

Came in and got great service from a waiter named Israel (he kinda reminded me of the waiter in Carlito's Way).  Ordered:  Shrimp cocktail - awesome Roasted Duck - great Filet mignon - It was \"ok\" only because the guest i was with that ordered it got it well done...boooooooo. Glazed carrots - i could eat these as a meal on their own.  Prices are good - not all crazy like the joints on the strip.  Has an old hollywood feel to the spot. If you can; have a date there.",

Let's start with the service, our waiter was lovely and attentive from the moment we sat down. Soon after, the manager came over and introduced himself and told us a bit about the restaurant and invited us to have a look around (as there are two separate dining rooms). The decor of the restaurant is stunning, you expect to turn around and see Dean Martin sipping a cocktail at the next table. Old school Vegas to a T.  Speaking of cocktails...the cocktail list was fantastic! I am a Jack Daniels fan so needless to say, I was thrilled the signature cocktail \"The Barrymore\" featured Gentleman Jack. It was outstanding, as was the Batida Leblon which was completely different but still tasty.  Now, the best part...the food! Great breads to kick off the meal with a cherry/bacon roll (yup!) and crispy, seasoned flat breads. The pan roasted chicken with pea/carrot risotto was unbelievable. So fresh and simple but delicious. My friend had the crispy pork belly and was raving about it days later - said it is the best she ever had. For dessert, we had the special which was a pear creme brulee...just fantastic.  This was hands down, one of the best meals I have ever had in Vegas and was a highlight of our trip. Oh yea, it is super reasonable too! Go and enjoy!",

    "text": "The Royal Resort hotel in Las Vegas is not the type of place you'd expect to find a top notch restaurant.  It is a non descript old time, second or third tier hotel.   And without the doorman pointing us in the right direction we may not have known the big white door lead to the restaurant itself.  But thankfully we found our way in to the restaurant.    There is a nice bar with a vintage feel to it, and an outdoor area as well.  The main dining room is replete with classic tufted booths along the walls which have some unique ink blot portraits of famous people.  The room has a feel that a lot of interesting stuff has gone on over the years here.  I am not usually a fan of the shellfish towers as they never seem to be worth the price but The Barrymore's version is a must get.  Crab claws, oysters, New Zealand mussels, shrimp, lobster all tasted great and fresh.  We had a couple of very good salads and then we all opted for various seafood dishes that were prepared deliciously.  In addition to some nice cocktails, the wine list was interesting and there were several reasonably priced options (the sommelier was quite helpful).  We didn't get to sample dessert as we were late for a show but that gives us another reason to come back.  The Barrymore offers a great option for a very nice meal off the Strip.  It is well worth finding it.",

    "text": "I guess I'm confused why everyone is going ape-shit over this place.  Yes, it's good, but not OHMYGODDDDD TEAR MY EYEBALLS OUT GOOD!  The Barrymore is inside the Royal Casino (Convention Center Dr. between Paradise & Las Vegas Blvd.; across from Ross & Walgreens).  As we were trying to find a parking spot (no valet) we were approached by a very pushy homeless man that wanted to crawl into my trunk.  Then when my husband gave him $10 he looked at me and wanted another $5.  Ugh, greedy mother-fer!  When you walk into the restaurant, there is a bar with a TV and a few tables.  You can get food served to you in there if you can't get a seat in the dining room.  Anyways, I had made a reservation for 7:30pm.  We got there a few minutes early and we were seated right away in the dining room.  There was ONE other table there!  I was surprised for a Friday night that they were so empty!  We were greeted by the waiter that was waiting for us and promptly got us a glass of Riesling ($8).    We ordered:  *Crispy Fried Outer Banks Calamari ($13) w/ romesco sauce, herbs & lemon. - The waiter said the romesco sauce was new.  It's orange in color would make you think that it might be spicy.  It's good.  I could not put my finger on what the flavors were exactly, but they complemented the calamari.  The batter on the calamari is light.  *Shrimp Cocktail ($14) w/ barrymore spicy cocktail sauce. - You get 3 VERY LARGE shrimp that were FULL in flavor!  Delicious!  The waiter brought out some bread.  My husband really liked the bread with cherries and bacon in it.  He said that it was better than Vintner Grill's!  For our entrees: *Crispy Pork Belly ($23.50) braised with Korean flavors, kimchee fried rice, ginger carrot emulsion. - Now I went COMPLETELY against everything, since I typically HATE pork but ordered it anyways.  It was delicious!  Now, it wasn't crispy, like I was thinking, but it had a nice sear to have a slight crunch to it.  The fried rice was a perfect complement to all the Korean flavors.  yum!  *Chicken Mole (special) - This was one of the specials of the night.  The chicken was extremely tender!  The husband ordered this one.  He said that it was good, but next time he would order the pork belly!  The service was very good.  We constantly had people checking on us- a few managers, waiter, bus boy.  All said & done, our bill $100, definitely not bad for a night out.  We looked at the dessert menu, but nothing caught our eye, so we bounced out.  The decoration was gorgeous!  Very rich looking wall paper and reels on the ceiling.  Loved the chic look of the entire restaurant!  In the hotel, there is a table hockey that the husband and I were going to play, but apparently someone stole the balls and they weren't going to replace them.  Weird!  I would maybe go back for lunch, but I think I would rather just go for a few drinks and some appetizers, as most of the appetizers sounded good to me!",

    "text": "The Barrymore by far ranks up there with some of the most excellent dinning experiences I've had. After a few disappointing meals in Vegas, I decided to Yelp for a good restaurant, and immediately was drawn to the numerous glowing reviews. I was a little surprised to find the restaurant located in an older hotel (The Royal Resort) but don't let that fool you...and if you can look at it from the perspective of an experience of vintage Las Vegas, you'll actually appreciate the location. Upon entering The Barrymore, I was greeted by a warm hostess, and treated as though completely appreciated for choosing them. My waitress was equally warm, professional, attentive, and thorough.   The decor at the Barrymore is very deliberate old Las Vegas, without a hint of pretentiousness. It feels like it's a part of Las Vegas history, even though it's a fairly new restaurant. Not many restaurants pull this off well; if they are \"vintage\", most seem blatantly contrived. Everything from the continual sea of light blue upholstery velvet, to the wood frames mirrored matrix on the walls, to the film-reel adorned suspended ceiling tile grid says authentic vintage '60's Vegas to me. Not a single dumb, framed fake photo anywhere.  Ok, so now the food. One word. Exquisite. Starting with the complimentary trio bread basket, which consisted of slightly toasted baguette slices, a sweeter wheat bread, and a spicy flatbread. For an appetizer, I started with the lobster Mac 'n Cheese (highly recommended), which was a perfect blend of flavor and consistency. My entree was one of the specials that evening, a sole dish that was spectacular. I wish I'd have inquired further about the makeup of the dish but I was too consumed with the goodness and flavor of it. Every bite was succulent and savored.  Chris, the attending manager, made his rounds to each table and talked for a few minutes....a very personable gent...a perfect personality fit for the restaurant.   Upon leaving The Barrymore, my wallet was a little  lighter, palette extremely satisfied, and the evening wonderfully fulfilled. The only thing that would have made it better would have been to share the experience with my girlfriend, but since I was in LV at a conference, I had to unfortunately dine alone.   I wish for nothing but a well deserved and long success for the staff and owners.",

    "text": "Cool little spot tucked away in an unassuming hotel just off the strip.  The new trend in Vegas is refurbishing older hotels rather than blowing them up and starting from scratch.  The Royal Resort, home of the Barrymore, is one such re-habbed and re-concepted hotel.  Others include the Plaza downtown and Treasure Island (now known as TI).  Anyhow, the lobby is pretty cool, with a funky pooltable, shuffleboard, and a piano sitting around waiting for use.  Whoever did the Barrymore has huge expectations for the space.  They definitely sunk a lot of dough into the place.  It is kind of an odd juxtapolition, actually, alongside the comparatively stark, bachelor-pad vibe of the lobby.  The menu is pretty cliched modern steakhouse with the requisite lobster mac and cheese and creamed spinach, stone crabs on special.  Steaks are expensive and served a la carte, sides and sauces extra.  The room is small and a bit claustrophobic.  There were only a few tables in there at prime time and one was an obnoxious birthday party.    When you're forking over 38 bucks for a couple of lamb chops with no sauce or side and 50 bucks for 6 tiny \"floater\" stone crabs, you expect a certain level of decorum to be observed in the dining room.  The  screaming birthday table was not aware of this unwritten rule, unfortunately.    Oh, well.    Also, the prices were strip-level in spite of the location and the non-union labor.  Casino restaurants generally use union labor which costs about twice what non-union labor costs, hence the higher cost.  Also, they pay higher rents and higher build-out costs.  The Barrymore prices don't reflect their lower costs so I guess they expect to compete with the big boys in the casinos straight up based on quality and service.  Good luck with that.  Anyways, the food was good.  The room was cool.  I like the funky location and hidden gem aspect.  I was torn between a 3 and 4 for this place.  I'm gonna bump em up to 4 just for the campy, old school vibe and the film-reel ceiling.",

His selection of Pinot Noir was right on the mark!  We ordered the Sicilian octopus appetizer which my daughter and I shared (the BF opted to pass.)  The bread basket was awesome. Fresh baguettes, parmesan cheese crisps and a hearty bread that was sweet (dried fruit) and savory (our favorite.)  The octopus was a little on the chewy side, but was still delicious topped with the onion relish.  My daughter had squash curry.  True to Gabriel's word, the curry was light and delicious.  I will be on the search for vadouvan spice in Vegas soon.   The BF had the NY Strip.  While no sauce was needed, the Bearnaise was the hands down winner.  I had the Alaskan halibut.  The fish was moist and very flavorful.  As a rule, I do not like okra (too slimy), but give me those crispy fried critters any day.   Just wish there were a few more.    We were all much too full for dessert, so we decided just to \"look\" at the dessert menu.  Gabriel said that his favorite dessert was the Raspberry Frangipane tart, which we shared (fought over).  The tartness of the sherbet and the sweetness of the almond raspberry tart were perfect.  We kept hitting spoons!  It was a great night, made special by the great company and interaction with Gabriel.  Did I say that I love Gabriel?",

Hostess to greet you as soon as you walk in, nice bar, stellar drinks, i loved the Barrymore made with Gentlemen Jack!! They have a cool little patio with a fire pit and the main dining room with the big booths was really retro and romantic. We started off with the foi gras and the steak tar tar, loved the first the second could have been a little more seasoned with a little kick. For entree my wife had the lobster, nice plating and agaist my wifes wishes  i could not pass up the steak house burger, it was huge and delish!! Apple tart for desert, very good. Service was good, nice pace on bringing out courses until we were finishing up entrees. Waited a bit for the clearing of plates and ordering dessert and actually getting the dessert and check. Over all we will def be back, hidden new gem, this is wherte i am sending people i know and people i meet when i am at work!!",

The Waiter was very knowledgeable of what the daily house specials were and shared his recommendations. Wanted to get a fruity cocktail but they only had a regular mojito on the menu and we wanted a strawberry kind - it's like what they say; you ask and you receive. The prices were very reasonable - ordered the \"Pan Roasted 'Jidori' Free Range Chicken - \"pea & carrot\" risotto\" and \"NY Strip 14oz\". The steak was ordered to be cooked medium however when it came out it was medium rare. The coolest thing happened; the manager came out and explained what happened and he asked to take my plate to get me what I ordered; in 5 mins it was right out and was perfect.  The service and atmosphere in this place is to die for and I will be back here next time I'm in Vegas because it's not about the \"lights, camera, action\" but about being able to eat your food with good background music and a place that actually acts like they want you to be there.   Awesome!!",

It still seems like a hidden away secret and I know next time I'm in Vegas I won't be able to get same day reservations and the prices may increase to reflect how amazing this food really is.  Our cab driver did not know of this place at all.  It is Far end North strip (think past Encore near Circus Circus area and just off the strip in a quietish looking hotel.  The restaurant has a good atmosphere not haughty, but classy and comfortable.  Our waiter was excellent.  I had the heirloom tomato appetizer, filet mignon, and cheesecake while my husband had the Ahi, all amazing really truly.  You won't regret going here!

My brothers very good friend is the sommelier here, and so we decided to check it out. And I have to say it was the highlight of my entire trip. We ordered twp of their specials, the Hanger steak and the Monk fish. They were unbelievable! I mean, the best meal I have ever had. Our friend Chris Banks also sent out some delicious appetizers and paired them with wine.We loved everything he sent! We had the artichokes and the mussles. Again, amazing. The restaurant is at the far north end of the strip just past Encore on Convention Ctr drive, but it so worth the trip no matter where you are staying. And also provides a wonderful break to the chaos that Vegas often has. The atmosphere was refined and relaxing. Our server, Katie, was pleasant, knowledgeable and professional. I highly encourage anyone and everyone to check out this new restaurant!!!!  You will be amazed!",

    "text": "My father wanted to treat me for my birthday, so he asked me to pick a nice restaurant in Vegas. I like to experience new places, so I decided to check out Yelp and trip advisor to see what they suggested. I was intrigues about the Barrymore. So secluded and unknow, yet the reviews were fantastic. We made reservations for Saturday night and went there. I had already warned everyone that the hotel its located at, is not much too look at. It's not bad, actually--but when compared with the fancy giants like the Wynn or the Bellagio, it looks like a dump. But it is not bad, just not as fancy as what you may expect on the southern strip. The restaurant is small, tiny to be more exact. It took a bit to get our table, but nothing to be concerned about. Service was great (9/10). We ordered the lobster mac & cheese. It was great, but very filling. I ended up leaving half of it, because I didn't want to spoil my appetite for the steak I had coming up. I also ordered the filet mignon with the bernaise sauce, the asparagus and the mushrooms. The steak was the best I've ever had in my life. It was so delicious, and so perfectly cooked that I ended up not using the sauce. The taste of the steak was just spectacular. We ordered a couple of Cabernet bottles that were also fantastic (thanks to the suggestion of the somelier). Even though the asparaghus and the mushrooms were good, but nothing out of the ordinary, I'll still give the food a 10/10 on account of the steak alone. We didn't have any room for dessert, so I can't really tell you about those. Prices are high, as you would expect in any fancy restaurant, but they are not as high as in many other Vegas restaurants. THe ambience is great, also 10/10. Feels vintage, but extremely clean and preserved. This is the first time I'll give a restaurant a 10 out of 10. We had a fantastic night, and I'm glad we went there. You should go there too. Avoid the overpriced, mediocre hotel restaurants, and shoot for the Barrymore. You won't regret it--Make reservations first.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas again and tired of the same old pricey Strip restaurants, great as they are. We asked a friend where the locals would go for great food, but near our hotel. Our cab driver had no idea where this place was, let alone the Royal Resort. If you are an urbanite foodie seeking a hole-in-the-wall hidden gem, this is it. Right around the corner from Wynn with an old city steakhouse retro kind of feel to it, The Barrymore does not disappoint. Manager Chad Jahn seated us and started us off with our request of what we now call the Barrymore Berrylicious. Fabulous cocktail! Our servers were friendly and down-to-earth. We were personally greeted at our table during dinner by Chef Francisco Campa. The food was UNBELIEVABLE! Presentation, flavor combinations, freshness and attention to detail. Highly recommended: Watermelon Carpaccio (w/cucumber, mint, feta/olive oil), Roasted Artichoke (ask how they make this..very unique!), Lobster Mac n' Cheese (I almost cried to see this finally done right!), Short Rib (melts in your mouth, served on carrot mousseline) and the Opakapaka Snapper with a curry mango sauce. Prices are low for the area and food quality: 13 for cockails, 11 for apps, 22-27 for entrees we had. You won't get the flashy, high-heeled hostess/servers here or modern music if that's your thing, but you will get genuinely great food and service in a local type of atmosphere. Great (small) outside patio and bar area too. I believe the restaurant has some affiliation to Drew Barrymore's family but we didn't get the whole story on that. Best part was, for all the times I entered Aria doors to get to a club or restaurant, or return from shopping with hands full, not once did a well-suited Bellman open a door, and I'm no tacky tourist. I was greeted at the Royal with an open door right after I got out of the cab. Now that's service! 5 Stars for this boutique restaurant. Don't let the old hotel fool you.  We'll be back!",

    "text": "Don't believe the hype!   My husband and I had made a reservation a couple of weeks in advance, yet when we got there the hostess tried to tell us the only thing they had available was an awkward table in the bar area. When we balked it was only then they changed their story that they did have another table.. Something about saving it for another reservation? Huh... Bad start.  We order our drinks. I got the Barrymore \"signature\" cocktail that was all whiskey and not much else, and the waiter had to run to the bar twice to find out what style of beer one of their offerings was for my husband. Obviously had no clue about their beer list. Oh yeah, and my drink was delivered to me by reaching clear across the front of me-- not the end of the world but if you want to fancy yourself as a fine dining establishment you need to nail these little details.  The manager came around and shook our hands which I thought odd to do before the meal. Seemed like a nice enough guy but I don't want to touch your man hands right before I eat.   We started with the caesar salad and roasted artichoke which were both ok. We noticed all the tables around us had bread so we asked the passing manager if we could get some he responded, \"sure I'll get you more bread..\" I felt like saying \"not more bread, some bread.\" Sorry to put you out there, buddy!  Our entrees were far from spectacular. My husbands strip steak was way rarer than the medium well he had asked for and bloody as hell, and while I ordered the scallops without the oxtail stew since I don't eat red meat, I was surprised that that left me with three... THREE. Scallops. Thats an average of over $8 apiece for these sad scallops. I guess the waiter thought this was perfectly fine and offered no solution like \"hey I see you're paying 26 bucks for three scallops would you like something else other than the oxtail stew?\" But at this point I didn't feel like putting in an effort, so I let it go. Sides were ala carte-- mashed potatoes were yummy but runny like baby food consistency, and the asparagus was not fresh.   Needless to say we did not stick around for dessert and will never go back. I rely on yelp reviews everywhere I go and I was shocked that this was so off the mark!",

The one part of the decor that I did not like was, the statues of golden eagles. These statues seemed really out of place for this restaurant.    When we sat down the server came over right away to introduce himself. He was very nice and knew everything on the menu. He recommended some drinks to try since it was our first time there. The cocktail that I would recommend would be, The Barrymore. It was very good and the bartender puts a lot of liquor in it.   When it came time to order our meals there were a few good choices that caught my eye. We started off a Cesar salad that was delicious. I ordered the fillet and my date had the scallops. Both entrees were cooked perfect and were very delicious. We also ordered the lobster mac and cheese. It sounded better than it tasted, but was still a good choice.",

The Barrymore is one of the best new venues to come along in many years, possibly during our entire stay.   The ambiance, service and unique menu combine to offer a one of a kind experience.    My family and I had Thanksgiving dinner at the Barrymore.  Our meal started with grilled octopus, calamari and lobster mac and cheese.  The grilled octopus is a sleeper, please try it.  Our entrees consisted of lobster, veal porterhouse and the short ribs.  All were impeccably prepared and presented.  Our outstanding server, recommended a side not on the menu, roasted artichoke risotto.  Good heavens, you have to ask for this side!  Our meal concluded with a sampler of outstanding desserts.  The Barrymore more than lives up to the fine review it received from CNN.   It combines old school Vegas exclusivity, charm and quality with a modern dining spin.  If you go, ask for Israel.  Israel, a Las Vegas veteran, can recommend fine wines from the outstanding list as well as items not on the menu that are sure to combine for a memorable experience.",

I was seriously disappointed with the lobster mac & cheese. The lobster mac & cheese is not cheesy at all. It is like an undercooked pasta with some creamy Alfredo sauce. there was no lobster in it! I decided to give them another try and ordered The creamy corn with bacon and lobster . it did not have bacon or lobster either. For my entree I had the duck. It was okay but nothing impressive. I do not recommend this restaurant at all. Even the waitress left our table and didn't come back for about 45 minutes. I was so disappointed that I spent my Valentine's Day dinner here. If I could give this play zero stars I would.",

    "text": "\"Here's Looking at You Kid\"  The Barrymore is a wonderful restaurant and bar located inside the Royal Resort Hotel walking distance from the Vegas strip.  Sitting in this restaurant makes you feel like you experiencing what Vegas must have been like during the rat pack era.  I was very impressed with the food, drinks, and ambience of the Barrymore.  i loved the decor, the service, and the cozy feeling of this place.  Although the Barrymore is located inside the Royal Resort Hotel, it is as good as any of the best restaurants located in the more contemporary hotels.  We visited on a cold winter afternoon for happy hour.  Lobster Deviled Eggs and a Barrymore Burger hit the spot.  They offer a full bar with signmature cockatails.  I had the Barrymore cockktail which offers an interesting distinctive taste all while giving you an alchohol fix, the wife had their margarita which was delish.  The Barrymore offered other cocktails that I would love to try for my next visit.  The Barrymore definitely gets my stamp of approval: Q!",

    "text": "*3.5 Stars*  We decided to try the Barrymore after reading the positive reviews on Yelp. The Royal Resort is actual a cute little place on the inside. The Barrymore was decorated nicely. We had a drink at the bar before dinner and then we were seated by the window. Um...let's just say, I would have rather not been seated by the window. The Barrymore is in a less than desirable location behind the strip. I had a view of a giant Ross, and the back of the Circus Circus. No thanks. I believe the ambiance of our dinner would have been much nicer had we been seated somewhere else. It ruined it a little for me.   Now on to the food. They brought out some bread and butter to start off with. Parmesan crisps, French bread and some pretzel bread with bacon and cranberries that was delicious. The flavor combo in that bread was insane. We ordered the mussels for our appetizer and they were very good, they had a nice sauce and some grilled bread to sop it up with.   For our entrees, I order the strip steak with a baked potato and my husband ordered the seared ahi. First off, let me say, I ordered my steak medium and it was almost rare. I don't have a problem with rare, I just prefer medium. It was seasoned very well and tender but I would have preferred it to be cooked longer. After a few bites, rare is a little difficult for me to eat. The baked potato was uneventful and I wish I would have saved my $6 dollars and the calories. My husband's ahi was delicious. I would recommend that dish.  We ended with the ricotta cheesecake and the sorbet.   I was a little disappointed in the cheesecake, it was good but it was tiny. We each had one bite each, it wasn't even half a piece. The sorbet was good, it tasted a little like Thrifty's to me.   All in all it was a solid meal. The service was a little weird, we had ordered a meal to go and they forgot, and they switched servers mid-meal. But our server was very nice and gave a good recommendation for a wine to go with my steak that was tasty and well-priced. Don't get me wrong, The Barrymore was very good and we may try it again. It was just lacking the wow factor that I look for when I go out for a nice meal.",

    "text": "It wasn't my first trip to the Barrymore.It was always a treat before - terrific food and great service. But last night was awful. The bar area where I sat at first to have a drink before dinner was a little warm and I asked the bartender what was going on. He made an excuse about the hotel attached to them not turning up their air conditioner and it affected them..  We got to the dining room to have dinner around 615pm. It was so hot in the room that sweat was dripping off my face and my clothes were stuck to me. We'd only been sitting for 5 minutes. I called over the waiter and asked what was going on. He said they were adjusting the air conditioning and it would be fine in a few minutes. It never cooled off and I was there with a client. We both ordered full dinners and couldn't even eat because it never cooled off. When I complained to the waiter again, he said \"well it was 85 when you first sat down and now it's only 80!\" I wanted to leave, but wehad already pordered and I hopd it wold eventually cool off. The food was good as usual, but we couldn't enjoy any of it. I was shocked the manager didn't come by to explain or didn't even make a gesture or offer us a drink or something to apologize. It was an awful experience and caused me embarrassment with my client. I am also in the hospitality business and know that these things can happen, but it's howyou treat your diners that matters. I will not ever go back there in the summer months, and certainly won't take my clients there again unless I'm sure they can properly accommodate their diners.   We both took our food home because we couldn't enjoy it What a disappointment!,",

    "text": "I had eaten here once before on a business trip to Vegas. The food was great then so I made reservations upon returning to sin city for vacation with my wife. It is just off the strip in a smaller hotel with a door almost completely hidden into the trim. The atmosphere is old school Vegas cool.  I started with the veal sweetbreads with bone marrow panisse which were absolutely delicious. The rich, fatty sweetbreads had a beautiful browning to the exterior and their richness was tempered with the panisse. My wife started with the lobster mac and cheese with truffle, mascarpone-tallegio cream sauce. Also fantastic. Definitely not the mac and cheese you remember as a kid.  For the main course, I opted for the evening's special, a Delmonico steak. It was seasoned and seared nicely on the outside and cooked perfectly to medium rare. For sides I ordered the cream corn and lobster with bacon as well as the creamed spinach. The cream corn was delicious as is and the creamed spinach did need a little salt and pepper.  My wife opted for the Pan Roasted 'Jidori' Free Range Chicken with white asparagus risotto and sauteed pea tendrils. She shared a bit with me and it was also wonderful. The chicken was moist inside but the skin was crisped nicely. The risotto was creamy and rich. She absolutely loved it.  For dessert we ordered the Passion Fruit Creme Brulee with raspberry lemongrass salad and toasted coconut sorbet. The creme brulee was tart, but pairing it with the coconut sorbet balanced the dessert out nicely.  This is probably one of my top 5 favorite places to eat on the planet and I will be sure to make reservations every time I'm in Vegas.",

I came by with Jadira R and she's right, the calamari was delicious. Perfect texture inside and out. I had a Caesar salad that was good and a bit different since all the lettuce was thoroughly chopped. For dessert I got the gelato which had a strange flavor to it but it was still pretty yummy. I also stole a few bites of the creme brulee and that was amazing. I'd give them an extra star if the service was more consistent but I can certainly understand why it's so popular (by the time we finished dinner, every table was full). Will be back!!!",

Dont be turned off by the initial entrance to the complex. Tucked just inside the entrance is a little bit of gold.  The service is always excellent, attentive without being overbearing. Waiters are well educated in efficient, confident and knowledgeable service. The food is always perfect, the cocktails are delicious and the vibe is wonderful. LOVE the decor- beautiful fit-out. The owner, sorry I forget his name, has often popped by our table and chatted to us, asked about our trip and our meal. Such a personal approach is very refreshing. Wine list has a great diverse range and if you are not sure what to chose, put your confidence in your server- he/she will look after you. Looking forward to another visit in a few weeks time :) (Oh and get the lobster mac and cheese- it will change your life)",

    "text": "I got the special seafood combination which came with shrimp, sea bass, and lobster tail.  The shrimp and sea bass were OK but the lobster was very dry and rubbery.  I also had sides of cream corn and Brussels sprouts.  I thought they were a bit too rich and salty for me but not horrible or anything.  What was horrible was the SERVICE from the waiter Daniel and the manager Paul.  I was there for a birthday party with a group of 13.  Before dinner, we were told by Daniel that if we purchased a bottle of Rose, we would get free corkage for a bottle of wine that we brought.  We didn't even want an $85 bottle  Rose but figured \"why not?\"  When the $1400 bill finally came, the corkage fee appeared on the bill and we questioned the waiter about it.  He proceeded to argue with us that if we had purchased a couple more bottles of Rose then he would've waived the fee.  Becoming more and more annoyed, we asked to speak to the manager Paul.  We explained to Paul the misunderstanding in hopes that he could settle the small $35 error.  I was disappointed  to find out that he was unwilling to waive the minuscule $35 corkage fee from our pretty substantial bill of $1400.  Yes, I know it seems petty to argue over $35 (a few dollars a person) but isn't it more petty for the manager of this so called \"high end $$$$ restaurant\" to argue back?  I would completely understand if we were trying to ask him to knock off all of our alcohol fees but come on, $35 for corkage??!!!  He defiantly told us that the waiter Daniel had no authority to tell us that if we bought the bottle of Rose, we could get the corkage waived.  Well then shouldn't that mistake fall on Daniel and not us???  Nope, Paul said he could do absolutely nothing.  This of course infuriated everyone.  We were NOT happy.   We then requested them to remove the 20% automatic gratuity, for obvious reasons.  Paul said we couldn't do that since its an \"enforced\" gratuity.  Why should we pay 20% gratuity when the waiter lied to us and when the manager was incompetent??  It would be so easy for Paul to say \"sorry for the misunderstanding, I'll waive this $35 fee from your bill .\"  Instead, he chose to go the idiotic route and argue with us about how the waiter was wrong but we had to pay for his mistake.  Unbelievable service...in the worst way possible.  In the end we were still charged the $35 corkage and 20% gratuity!!!  I have never had a restaurant experience like this in my whole life.   Everyone was upset and complaining about the whole fiasco for the rest of the night.  Not what I expected from \"fine dining\" in Vegas.",

The Barrymore is located in the Royal Resort at the north end of the strip but technically off the strip.  The hotel lobby was pretty nicely decorated and furnished with a pool table, foozball, and there was even a pianist playing on the piano! Swanky!  I seriously love the decor of the main dining area with the old school movie reels on the ceiling.  Our waiter was super sweet and very helpful with menu selections.   I had the signature Barrymore cocktail which was heavy on the whiskey with a slight hint of orange. It probably would have been more delicious if I hadn't been sucking down on a football full of daiquiri all day... sigh.   The table shared the calamari and lobster mac n cheese. The calamari were lightly breaded and super tender - loved the romesco sauce with it!  The lobster mac n cheese was rich and decadent, definitely cannot eat too much of it in one sitting. For entrees I had the pan fried sea bass with a bean ragout and crispy baby brussel sprouts. Everything was super flavorful and I must admit my favorite thing on the dish were those crispy little brussel sprout bites!  At the end of the day I'm only giving The Barrymore four stars because although the food was delicious and flavorful, it wasn't mind blowing or extraordinary. Solid though.",

Never came by once to say  \"how's your meal\"  or  \"would you like a second cocktail\".  We've wanted to come here for years, and now we can tick it off the \"to do\" list which is a shame as we take people to Vegas several times a year and go over and over again to places like Vic and Anthony's, Lotus, DuPars and a few others. This won't be on that list.  When we were seated, it took a good time for anyone to come to the table, and eventually a very nice man came by who I am guessing was the Sommelier or bar manager came by to offer us drinks. After some time the waiter came by.  He seemed a little put off that we didn't order entrees (you know that fleeting moment where you read the expression on someone's face?), but rather, several appetizers. Maybe that's why he generally never came to our table again?  None the less, it was $140 worth of appetizers and drinks.   We had reservations, on a Saturday and showed up- the place was half-empty.  Maybe 4 tables out of the 10 were taken.  So the ignoring your table because you're so busy wasn't it.    Over-all, each of the dishes were just meh, okay.  Nothing was a standout and certainly this $140 dollar meal was worth more like at the most $40.   The bigger message is, the place seems tired. Service is always a good portion of the experience, and I don't know what's going on here, but they need to take a rest and re-group. The appetizers need a little work as well.",

    "text": "When you're looking for some of the best food in Vegas, this place needs to be on your list.  Yelp's reviews steered me here, and the crowd-sourcing came through. Admittedly, it's in a peculiar location. I mean, come on. The Royal Resort of Las Vegas is hardly Steve Wynn's place, and it's not even the Marriott brothers' place. It looks like a funky smaller hotel, and that's what it is, full of Damon Runyonesque characters, hangers-on to Jay-Z, and barefoot folks sprawled on lobby couches texting away. A throwback look, with a grand piano in the lobby, too.  The restaurant, though, is absolutely lovely. Slick bar with another motley crew of characters, attractive digs, and two dining rooms. Both packed on a Monday night. Impressive, you Yelpers.  The experience could have veered toward five star territory if not for a few glitches. To the Barrymore's credit, they went out of their way to make the glitches right, which was impressive as hell. First glitch? too-low lighting in one of the dining rooms, which happened to be the one in which we were seated. Fortunately, companion's eyes work better than mine. (I have other redeeming qualities). Our waitress Kendra M. not only came with her own business card, but with an extensive knowledge of the menu and a great melange of alt-looks and serious professionalism.   Opened with two drinks between us A perfect margarita and an even more perfect vodka martini. Whatever olives they're using in the martini should be patented. That martini was spectacular.  We started with the famed mac and cheese with lobster; it lived up to its tasty billing if not being particularly chunkified in the lobster department. Fois gras tasty. Breads warm and fresh. And it looks like we're rolling, right? She gets the duck, I order the NY strip streak....and a filet mignon comes out.  Well, not only did Kendra apologize and bring both back, so the right steak could be done right and the meal served at the same time, but the maitre d' stopped by, too. We were forgiving, but they acted like it was a personal failure that they were going to repair.  And they did.  Not only were the main courses brilliant -- maybe the best steak of the last year -- but they brought us two desserts and a glass of Remy.   You gotta like that. Thanks, Kendra.   A couple of tips:  a. if the eyes are an issue, ask to be seated in the brighter dining room when you book your table. b. don't panic if there's a big group in the second dining room. Acoustics were fine; we could talk just fine c. The house zin a bit hit and miss. Probably opt for the malbec or a cab.  We're so coming back here sometime. This was a wonderful meal and a wonderful experience. It ain't cheap, but sometimes you really do get what you pay for.",

The meal was so good and reasonably price we plan to return tomorrow.",

    "text": "I'm guessing you were led to this page because you searched for foie gras. That's how we ended up here. Overall, this is absolute crap food with crap drinks made with crap ingredients with crap service. For the same price range, just go with the tried and True and eat at Mastros or Bouchon or Craft.  Everything at Barrymore felt low class from the moment we got there. Reservation was at 9pm. We arrive at 8:55pm. Hostess tells us they're behind, but didn't fail to suggest to us 3 different times in the same breath to grab drinks at the bar while we wait. We opted to wait in the tacky hotel lobby that was trying too hard to look like SLS/Bazaar.  Seated at 9:30pm, outside. And, as it turns out, the rest of the country still smokes; and they all seem to be chainsmoking in Barrymore's patio. I asked if we could move inside, they inform me it'd take another 15-20 minutes. We suck it up and dine in smoke.   Drinks: No distinction from bottled wine coolers. Simple syrup seemed to be the key ingredient. Thoughtless and unimaginative; what you would expect from TGI Friday's happy hour (no offense, TGIF). Go with the bottled beers--at least they can't mess those up.   Artichoke appetizer: Overcooked beyond recognition--literally--we couldn't tell what the hell we were eating. Texture was so mushy it could've been mashed potatoes doused in oil. No resemblance to artichokes in any way shape or form.  Truffle lobster mac & cheese: Taste was ok, but the texture of the cheese indicated subquality product (I have a feeling it evolved from powder). Promising name; lazily executed.   Ribeye: Unremarkable.  Foie gras medallion with the steak: I blame this little piece of shit for putting us through this meal. It was not good; it tasted old and I suspect possibly previously frozen. Rubbery texture.   You know it's been a bad meal when the party skips dessert, which we did. You should skip this place altogether.",

    "text": "Despite some mishaps I think that The Barrymore is a fantastic restaurant.  My bf and I had reservations and came here on a Saturday night. Our server was awesome and the entire staff was really attentive the entire night.   Octopus app: 3/5 In terms of apps we tried the octopus since everyone seems to rave about it. The flavor profile was nice, I liked the aioli and the potatoes. My only issue was that the most of the octopus pieces were really chewy. Some pieces were super tender and delicious while the bigger pieces were kind of hard to eat. We let our server know and she brought out a new octopus. The second batch was a little better but it still wasn't as tender as other octopus that we had in the past. The manager kindly took the octopus off our bill which was much appreciated. I probably wouldn't order this again and go for the lobster mac & cheese instead.  Mashed potatoes: 4/5 Really solid mashed potatoes. Really creamy and smooth. Not the best I've ever had but still pretty delicious.  Sea bass: 5/5 This dish was AMAZING!!! This was our favorite dish of the night. The fish was cooked beautifully and the miso broth that it came with was delicious. I didn't care for the rice and frankly I didn't need it at all. Definitely a must have!  Short ribs: 4.5/5 The short ribs were tender, loved the sauce. The root veggies were perfectly cooked. Second favorite dish of the night.",

Everything i've had on the menu is just ridiculously good.  The type of good that when you take your first bite you're immediately sad because you know nothing will ever be that good again.  The rib eye is on that list.  As is the short-rib bourguignon.  The cocktails are simple and perfectly made.  The Old Fashioned here is one of the best i've ever had.    If you're still not convinced by my raving food review, then the atmosphere will do it for you.  Ron Burgundy would proud to call this place home.  The decor is upscale but simple, the waitstaff are very knowledgeable, and the management really seems to take an interest in your experience.    The location of this place is odd, in the Royal Resort, and so it's stayed somewhat hidden until lately, but this place will not stay secret for long.    You stay classy, Barrymore.",

    "text": "I hesitate to write such a glowing review because I don't want to share the great secret that is The Barrymore.  This off the strip steak house was outstanding.  It only has 10 tables which is perfect for a quiet, old-time Vegas experience.  As soon as we sat down, our server Danny and the sommelier Bryan tool great care of us recommending a bottle of wine that was excellent and well priced.  The steak was great, and the cream corn with lobster and bacon may be my new favorite side dish!  The entire experience was pure class and unlike much of Vegas, totally lacked pretense which is a welcomed relief.  We will absolutely recommend The Barrymore to others, and stop in next time we are back.  Many thanks to Danny, Joey, Bryan and Kerry for a wonderful dining experience.",

    "text": "This restaurant is the epitome of retro glam for sure. A group of us came in for a quick dinner before a show at the Smiths Center. None of us had a poor experience, but none of us had our minds blown either, hence the three star rating. This is only due to the prices being a bit steep for what you get. We were the first customers in the door at 5pm, and upon being seated, we did note that we had some time constraints due to our show. Surprisingly, despite being a recommended restaurant for people attending shows at the Smiths Center, they did not show any amount of urgency in getting our food out to us. The service was good, but not outstanding. As my boyfriend is a waiter that always goes above and beyond, I am a bit picky when it comes to service, so take that opinion with a grain of salt. Now for the food.   The complimentary bread basket may have been the highlight of the evening! lol  Apps:  Heirloom Tomato Salad - this was the stand out dish of the night. The tomatoes were perfect and the burrata was delicious and creamy.   Mains:   Chilean Sea Bass - the fish was cooked and seasoned to perfection, and the sauce was wonderful, but for almost $40, the portion was extremely small. The dish was served with grilled asparagus which was a bit mushy and unappetizing.  Filet - my boyfriend was not happy with this at all! While the seasoning was okay, the steak was overcooked. He ordered medium rare and received a medium cook. He also ordered the special \"oscar\" crab topping. It was pretty bland and not enough crab for the additional $35 dollars it cost, which was almost as much as the steak itself.   Sides:  Sauteed Mushrooms - these were very good, and the portion was very generous.   Lobster Mac n' Cheese - meh, nothing special. It was pretty bland and could have used a little texture as well.   Drinks:  We both got the Moscow Mule, these too were only okay.   Desserts: Unfortunately, because our food took so long, we did not have time for dessert.",

We finally made our return and wanted to give a review of the place.  Ambiance: Great intimate spot, low lighting and excellent decor around the place.  Very old vegas vibe in the classiness without actually being old and having a great clean feel.  Service: Best part of this place is excellent service.  Both waiters we have had were excellent, nice conversationalists, knew their wines and were attentive without being over bearing.  The bussers were pretty quick and ready with water.  Food: The food is pretty rich, but hey, you are here to splurge a little bit.  This is American cuisine, we've had most of the seafood options when we have came so I can't really speak much past that.  Some of the best scallops I have had were served here.  Next time I hope to get the famous Lobster Mac and Cheese.  Though it has the classics there are some adventurous items like Veal Sweetbreads, Muscovy Duck, and fish that we don't always see here.

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. During our 3-night stay in Vegas, my husband and I planned one romantic pricy restaurant night, to get away from the craziness of the strip and the casinos. We chose the Barrymore because the menu looked amazing and the restaurant was highly rated.   The food was indeed fantastic and I would give the Barrymore 5 stars for just the food. Unfortunately, the service was terrible. When we arrived, there was just one other couple finishing up their meal in the restaurant. We ordered our food and wine and while the wine arrived very quickly, the bread took quite a long time. In the meantime, three other large tables were seated, asked for their orders, and were brought bread. Odd, but this is not the reason for by 2 star review. Before moving on, though, I just wanted to mention that one of the breads that they serve has bacon in it. If you're a vegetarian, watch out!  Later, the lobster macaroni and cheese appetizer arrived and was amazing. The problems were entirely in the service of the entrees. My husband ordered a special, and I ordered salmon. Upon ordering, the waiter misheard \"salmon\" and asked if I said \"same.\" I told him that I actually said salmon, and, writing my order down, he reiterated \"salmon.\" What came out an hour later were two of the specials. Not a big deal - we told them that my order was actually the salmon, and the waiter unapologetically whisked my meal away.   For the next thirty minutes, I watched my husband eat his entree as I sat eating nothing. Now, I'm not in the restaurant business and I'm not sure what the protocol is for an incorrect entree, but I don't think the right thing to do is to leave one person (out of a couple!) with no food, while the other is awkwardly forced to eat his food alone so it doesn't get cold. I took a bite of my husband's dish, and it was delicious, but it was his meal and I was still waiting for mine so I just sat there, staring at my forks, as he uncomfortably ate his meal. Waiters and waitresses passed us and no one seemed to think that this dynamic was odd.   The cherry on top was when our bill arrived: the restaurant attempted to charge us for two of the specials instead of one special and one salmon. The price difference between the special and the salmon was $15. I pointed this out to the waiter and he very unapologetically said that this was the check for what he thought we ordered. I was actually expecting them to perhaps discount my entree or maybe provide a free dessert as an apology for the awkward meal due to my incorrect entree, but instead they tried to charge me $15 more for my meal!  This restaurant is quite expensive, and we were spending quite a chunk of change on a full meal with a bottle of wine. In exchange, what we hoped for was a pleasant meal that we could share together. Unfortunately, the Barrymore did not deliver.",

    "text": "THE BARRYMORE - A BIT OF OLD LAS VEGAS The Barrymore restaurant doesn't do any formal advertising. They don't have to. The food, the ambiance, the sincere interest demonstrated by reservations, wait staff, manager, and chef alike, make your dining experience a warmly personal and gastronomically delightful event and together create a charismatic memory that is unforgettable. The Barrymore is a little off the beaten path, located inside the Royal Resort at 99 Convention Center Drive,  North Las Vegas. Neither the geographical area nor the resort per se has any of the gaudy glitz or the excited roar of the Strip. But with a single step inside the doors of the restaurant, you feel the intrigue of LV's theatrical history and the luxury of its star-studded past come to life.  Dimly and tastefully lit, you are ushered past a cozily inviting and friendly bar area into the dining room itself.  There are six large curved booths, three on either side of the dining room, and four square tables down the center of the room, for a total of 40 or so patrons maximum at a time. Sink into the comfort of a cushiony booth seat and look up. The ceiling is a sea of large, empty, metal film reels that lie shoulder to shoulder and cover the expanse completely. Some of the walls look like they're papered with a richly flocked pattern, and on these walls are hung framed black and white pictures of famed Hollywood stars done in a manner reminiscent of Rorschach ink blots. The walls behind the booths feature side-by-side-by-side octagonal porthole-style mirrors. The atmosphere is romantic and intimate. The sounds of the likes of Sinatra provide a gentle and nostalgic backdrop.  The drink menu is large and varied, although there are not so many wines offered by the glass as some might wish to see, a fact that we noted while we were researching The Barrymore online from home prior to making reservations there through Open Table.  Although we are typically cab or merlot drinkers, we were attracted to an Italian Chianti that was offered both by the bottle AND by the glass.  Once at the restaurant, however, we couldn't find the Chianti on the single glass wine list at all, and asked our server about it. She went to great lengths to find the answer for us, and it finally turned out that the online menu hadn't been revised that season, although the in-store one had, and the by-the-glass feature for that particular wine had been deleted. The manager himself, Mr. Chad Jahn, came to our table to apologize and to let us know that the error in the online drink menu had already been corrected. Shortly after our main courses of deep sea scallops and halibut arrived, Chad and the chef, Francisco Campa, came again to the table to ask how we were enjoying our meals.  Breaking here to describe our dinners. There was a small relish tray brought to the table, as well as a basket of breads.  The latter consisted of two pieces of parmesan flat bread, some epi (a dry, braided, unsweetened crusty bread with a soft center), and two sweet rolls. All were sampled and all were awesome! The scallop plate ($29) had three large sea scallops, some seasoned green beans that had been roasted, and risotto in squid ink. The veggies and risotto were a delight. The scallops were delicious although the seasoning on top was a bit too salty for my taste. The halibut plate ($27) consisted of a nice piece of fish, about 4-5\" long and 1.5 - 2\" thick, a block of potatoes au gratin, and green beans pesto. Both plates were artfully arranged and visually appetizing. The service was impeccable. The concern of the manager and the chef relative to the quality of our dining experience was refreshing and I believe genuine.  The prices were very fair considering the uniqueness of the restaurant itself, the quality of the food, the personal service, and the fact that one will pay considerably more anywhere else on the Strip for a lesser but similar dinner experience.  In short, The Barrymore should be on YOUR list of \"must do's\" when in Las Vegas. It's a definite winner and that's a sure bet!",

In a sea of overpriced, big hotel, big name chef corporate food, The Barrymore emerges with amazing food and I just had the burger.  It was a taste sensation with the bacon marmalade stealing the show.  Oh yes, the bacon infused bread deserves a mention too.  With wines 50 and Under, you can't go wrong.

    "text": "This restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. It's randomly located in an older hotel located right off of the strip. It almost has a speak-easy feel to it.. really cool. For the most part, the food is good. Appetizers were tasty and cooked perfectly. Our party got the shrimp cocktail, lobster mac and cheese, rock shrimp and the grilled octopus. All really amazing. Where the restaurant was lacking was the service and the quality of the entrees. Our steaks and fish were overly seasoned with salt, it almost rendered it inedible. We would have said something or perhaps sent it back if it didn't take an hour for our entrees to come out after we had finished appetizers. I've been to this place twice, and both times had an issue with the timing of the entrees coming out at a reasonable time. It's a shame because for the price, you want to be able to enjoy eating all of your food, but waiting for that long you begin to get full and lose your appetite from the appetizers expanding in your stomach:( The service was ridiculous. We had about 4-5 servers and all seemed to be on different pages. You'd think with that much help, that things would run a bit smoother than it did. And when we asked how much longer our entrees would take (this is at 40 minutes after our appetizers were removed), we got shot back with an attitude. Not ok at all. I've worked in the service industry for seven years, and it was very hard to keep my blood from boiling over when we were treated this way, especially since our check total came out to more than $1000! Overall, our dinner took a little over 3 hours, when it should have been over in 2. By the end of it all, we were absolutely exhausted and instead of going out to enjoy the night, we all were just ready to go home. Any-who, with that being said, I sadly will not be returning to this establishment. First time shame on you, second time shame on me. It is truly a shame because it really is a beautiful restaurant.",

I believe its USDA choice.  It was overcooked and I did let the waiters know and I was offered a replacement.  GIven I was with a party, I didnt want to hold up everyone so i ate it and they gave me a very small cheesecake as a replacement.  The steak itself (besides the overcooked part) was alright.  Nothing out of the ball park.  for $65 for 2 ppl servings (I shared with a friend), I expected a little bit more.  More like USDA Prime meat quality.    They steak sauce is AMAZING! You should get the hordnaise sauce, im not spelling it right.  They have their Barrymore sauce too.  Friend had the VEGGIE CURRY.  Dont order, its blend and not tasty.  Other friend ordered New York steak i believe, its the other one.  Its alright too.  BUT,  they have AWESOME service! Totally a place to bring a date! Ambiance is awesome, small and cozy.  Waiter is attentive.  They CLEAN your table after you eat and take plates right away.  Take bread crumbs away and very attentive.    Given the price, service and quality, I feel that 4 stars is what this restauant gets.  COme here for a good time, but not awesome food!",

    "text": "Ok, second time coming here and I have to say its just amazing.  Been to many places and mostly overhyped celebrity places on the strip.  The service is amazing and friendly which is hardly found on the strip.  Every dish I've ever had is amazing, especially the creamed corn/lobster and bacon  and the braised short ribs!  Had the ribeye this time and it was cooked perfect!  Atmosphere is great, and every employee including the Manager is professional welcoming.  What i like is that most people eating here come dressed decent and not the usual Vegas casual attire.  One thing I hate is going to a so called upscale place on the strip and seeing people in Jeans and a designer T-shirt.  I just hope The Barrymore upholds everything they currently due and does not fall into the habit of changing for the masses or the \"at the moment\" trends so often found in this town!!  If I had to give one suggestion it would be keep the blinds closed until sundown.  First time I went was in the winter so it was already dark and the view was nice with the torches and city lights.  But this time was last week around 6:30 and it was still light out, sat by the window and had to look out onto the street and buildings.  But other than that minor thing this is my one of my top 2-3 places to dine in Vegas!!!",

It's def off the beaten path and you will be skeptical when you see the hotel it's in and the location (as I was), but the restaurant is amazing!  Perfectly prepared food and portions, stunningly beautiful and elegant decor, fabulous service...it was a 5-star dinner all around!  I had the filet mignon and mushrooms, and my hubby had the diver scallops - both dishes were superb.  We also had the squash curry dish as an appetizer (although it's an entree) and it was very delicious - would be a great entree for a vegetarian.  Prices were good too, especially compared with the 5-star restos on the Strip.  We will definitely dine at The Barrymore any time we are in Vegas again!",

    "text": "Perhaps their food is good. Unfortunately we didn't get that far. My family and I were looking for a place in Vegas to celebrate my Dad's 60th b-day. It was a bit last moment, and we wanted a classy looking place that could accomodate 8 people for dinner at a short notice. Most places of that nature were already booked until finally we found Barrymore, reviews looked good, and the location really is very close to the Strip. We made multiple phone calls there to assure the reservation and ask any relevant questions. The service we received before even ordering food was so ridiculously bad, I am not sure folks there realize just how easily a reputation of a restaurant could be ruined by a couple of bad reviews. Perhaps, it was just a really bad shift manager, so I don't want to necessarily criticize the whole establishment. But let me just mention the facts1)We had certain liquor preferences and asked them about a corkage fee. On the phone they said it would be $30, which would have been fine. When we came and asked them to open our bottle, they said they have no license to serve liquor (even though there was definitely wine on the menu and hard liquor at the bar), but it wasn't \"an issue $100 wouldn't fix\". 2) They were quite rude to my mother who asked about some special dietary accomodations for our elderly guests. As the manager was responding, he actually took a swig of vodka in front of her. 3) We decided to leave (having no back up plans and having the b-day ruined), the manager chased us out, cursed out my whole party (including the f*** word), and asked a bunch of well dressed respectable people to never come again (and this in front of all the other patrons). It was especially embarassing because all of us were from out of town, had no cars, and had to just stand out in the dark and cold on an iffy plaza trying to arrange rides. So, definitely think twice before making any special plans at this place until and unless the management changes.",

    "text": "My buddy and I arrived early and had an hour to kill before our Saturday night reservation. We had a seat in the lounge area and decided to have some appetizers and cocktails. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the wines and the drinks.  The special app of the night was Frogs Legs, which I hadn't eaten in years. I ordered us up an order of those and the Lobster Deviled Eggs. The Deviled eggs were very rich with the truffle oil and caviar topping and had that touch of lobster flavor from the diced up pieces of meat in them, but didn't overpower the eggs. Awesome!! The Frogs Legs came out and were fall off the bone tender and highly flavored. My buddy had never eaten them before and was a bit shy about trying them but did and loved them also. Killer app. We were seated for dinner afterwards and ordered 3 more apps to share.....the veal loin with tuna sauce, the roasted artichoke, and the beef tartare..........all incredibly delicious!! Very impressive. I ordered the lamb rack medium rare, and my buddy ordered the special bone in cowboy ribeye medium. My rack was perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth tender. My buddy's steak was more towards Medium rare/rare, which to him was  a bit of a turn off. We sent it back and it still came out rarer than requested. Funny, as I recall seeing multiple complaints on websites about undercooked meat.  If it was me, I'd have eaten it but then again, that's my preferred way to eat a steak. I tried his and it was sublime. The waiter was annoyed at the kitchen for his steak misstep, but was very attentive , knowledgeable, and nice. Overall, the atmosphere was great. Staying on the strip on a Saturday night in the Cosmopolitan was absolutely insane busy, and so were their restaurants. It was terrific to be able to have a meal where it you could actually have a conversation and not be at all rushed, in such a tranquil atmosphere. Their pricing is also a bargain when compared to the hotel restaurants also.  Go there with confidence that you will have a memorable meal and mention to the waiter to make sure your steak needs to be medium, if you like it that way, or the chef will err to the underdone side. Awesome restaurant and atmosphere and food to die for made for a memorable evening.",

We asked them to give us a call if they got a cancellation and they called with a 730 available time.  They were very pleasant.  We arrived and and had a drink at the bar were seated fairly promptly.  Restaurant had nice atmosphere.    We began with the lobster deviled eggs.  They were definately fresh good for deviled eggs but if lobster wasn't in the name I would not have guessed there was lobster in the dish.    I had the chopped salad and my husband had the dinner salad with balsalmic dressing.  Both were fresh, mine had good flavors.  For our main course I had the lobster mac and cheese (the appetizer left me wanting more lobster) and my husband had the the Hangar Steak.  Mine wasn't at all special not even great for mac and cheese and again minimal lobster and no significant lobster flavor.  My husband really didn't like his steak and although small didn't finish the dish.  Really said the flavor was off.    The waiter recognized my husband didn't enjoy the flavor and was very apologetic.  Although my husband would not have sent it back no one really came by to check if everything was ok until it would have been too late anyway.    The waiter did comp the dessert because of my husbands dislike of his dish and was very eagar to make it right.  My husband ordered the molten lava cake and this was really dry without any real \"molten\" center.  I don't like to write bad review but this restaurant is way over rated in my opinion.  The staff was very pleasant but they could not make up for the poor flavors in the food.    We will not return.",

    "text": "Visited with my fiance on our last night in Vegas and had a great time. Off the beaten path so had to Uber over which was a slight inconvenience but ended up being for the better because the place wasn't packed wall to wall with people. Our waiter, Daniel, was stellar and we had constant attention from servers, sommelier, and management. We had a friend make our reservation here for us and unbeknownst to us he had ordered a bottle of wine for us for when we arrived. The wine was at the recommendation of the sommelier with no direction as to what wine we like besides 'red'. We were presented with the Yangarra grenache which we both enjoyed, thumbs up to the sommelier for that one. Another thing I love is that they had a dedicated scotch list on the back end of their drink menu. Too many places only list their wine and cocktails so it's nice to see the full scotch list, especially when there's multiple selections. Now, for the food.  Appetizer: bread is complimentary and the pretzel rolls are awesome. We ended up getting the bone marrow for an appetizer to share. I'm a huge fan of bone marrow but it's something Ashley is still getting accustomed to. She said the Barrymore provided her with her favorite bone marrow so far and I love it as well. Wish it would have come with slightly more bread but we still had some complimentary rolls left over so it worked out fine.   Entrees: Being that it is a steakhouse I went with the filet mignon. Ashley doesn't eat steak so she was already hesitant coming here but got the salmon and had good things to say about it. Ordered the filet medium rare and it was prepared PERFECTLY. Steak was seasoned well but not too much so another thumbs up in my book. I usually avoid steaks when at restaurants because I can be a bit of a snob and don't always feel a restaurant is fair to judge based on their steaks if that's not their flagship menu item. Barrymore delivered me a great cut of meat, prepared wonderfully, and it didn't kill my wallet either. Other restaurants on the strip would charge 50% more for a steak of that caliber.   Sides: Ashley went with the brussel sprouts and I had the cream corn and lobster. Being an Iowan, it's not often I get lobster in my corn but it was great. Ashley raved about her brussel sprouts and the few I tried we're good, although I'm not a brussel sprout guy.  Dessert: opted for a less traditional dessert and went with the Taylor Fladgate Century flight. Originally I had tried to order the Taylor Fladgate 30 year but the server directed me towards the century flight as, although a slight upsell, was much better value all things considered. It was great to get to compare the different generations of port and obviously something you don't see everywhere. Really enjoyed it and appreciate Daniel taking the time to explain that to me and recommend it.   We had a great time and the food was wonderful as well. Too often when Ashley and I dine out at fancier places it sometimes seems we aren't a priority due to our age (20's) with the service staff. This couldn't have been further from our experience with The Barrymore and we were left with a 5 star experience. Thanks again!",

    "text": "I had a group of 9 coming in for a birthday dinner, so I worked with Stevie and arranged for a pre fixe menu and ordered a cake for the party.  Stevie was wonderful - very friendly and attentive. The restaurant was lovely, but that's about where it ends for me.  Where the group was seated,seemed to be just outside the kitchen and there was a VERY strong (overpowering) fish smell. The service was \"ok\" but not very friendly, and definitely  \"no special attention\" was given.  The food was not prepared well. Many in the group ordered steaks and requested them medium, medium well or well. Almost everyone of them came out very undercooked. Mine was raw/ rubbery on the inside and I had to send it back, as did a few others. The cake was BEAUTIFUL -  looked exactly like what I had requested, but even that didn't have a great taste. It was ok, but I really expected more for a $150.00 8 inch cake. I really had high hopes for this dinner, but honestly left very disappointed and sad. I wanted to give my husband a memorable birthday dinner, but it left a LOT to be desired.",

    "text": "2 stars= food 1 star= service  One of those places where first impressions are everything.....the Barrymore FAILED, miserably.   A reservation was made far in advance for a birthday dinner, and was reinforced with the hostess upon arrival but no attention was taken to it after that. We were also completely IGNORED during our meal by our server and the manager that was trolling the dining room. So here goes...  Happy hour at the Barrymore includes bottles of wine, so we bought one because the bartender was not hospitable to offer a cocktail. The hostess wished me a happy birthday and guided us to a plush booth in a room of 3 parties of guests = a total of 10 guests in the dining room, including us. It was romantic and inviting.  Once we were seated, the waiter arrived and noticed we already had a bottle of wine, picked up the bottle and stated, \"Oh I see you have wine already, you must have gotten here for happy hour.\"  I was a little taken aback by his comment, but I let it go. He suggested some appetizers (the two most expensive ones), announced the specials, and offered sparkling or still water. He never offered another bottle of wine, mind you our bottle was 3/4 empty by now. A couple of minutes passed and a female server arrived with bottled water: glass bottle of Evian, nice ($9-nice we later found out).   Another 10 MINUTES passed, while watching our server walk back and forth pass us, in addition to a suited man strolling the dining room, then our server returned to take our order. By this time, we were ready to order everything, appetizer and dinner, so we did. We decided on the octopus that came recommended, and I chose the salmon entree. Noted in the menu as \"pan-fried with crispy skin,\" the waiter warned me that the Barrymore cooks their salmon to \"medium\" and I was fine with that, in fact, I prefer it (I was later disappointed). The other entree we ordered was the squash curry. The waiter tried to upsell it by asking if we wanted to add shrimp or lobster. I didn't see that option in the menu anywhere, but whatever. We also opted for the creamed corn w/ lobster side dish, as recommended. I asked for bread before he left. Again, no attention taken to our now empty wine bottle or if we wanted more.   A few minutes later, the same female busser? arrived with bread and butter. During this time, I noticed the suited man again strolling the dining room and watching each table. He didn't seem to engage very much or engage with anyone. He stopped at our table earlier and noticed our wine had not been poured for us, so he graciously refilled our glasses and left the empty bottle on the table without any conversation. WEIRD. The octopus appetizer was delivered to the table by our server and he announced what it was then left. Again, NO OFFERING OF MORE WINE OR DRINKS. The octopus appetizer was excellent. Octopus wasn't chewy at all, perfectly grilled and the vegetables were very tasty. We thoroughly enjoyed the appetizer, every last bit of it without any attention from our waiter. He never returned to see how it was or if we were satisfied. He did manage to bus the empty plate. The female busser? again returned and cleaned up our table, then reset it for dinner.   After about 5-7 minutes, it was quick, dinner arrives and is brought to the table by the female who I am now sure was just a food runner. She was by far, the best person working there and I can't understand why she wasn't waiting tables. To recap, two more tables arrived during our dining period but one table also left leaving a total of 5 tables and now 14 guests in the dining room for our server. As we enjoyed our meal, I started to notice that the salmon was NOT cooked to medium, as previously announced. In fact, it was so dry that I had to spoon the sauce from the other meal we ordered in order to make it appetizing. The vegetables that accompanied the salmon were excellent and full of flavor; lots of colorful baby carrots and potatoes. The squash curry was good but REALLY lacked salt, it was very one-dimensional, and the vegetables were so finely diced that they resembled something you would use for a breakfast hash. It was also missing couscous. For $25, my salmon was oily and overcooked (and farm-raised at that); while for $22, the squash curry was disinteresting and unpleasant to look at. We completely finished our meal and were NEVER checked on by our server or the manager. Where does that happen? and why??  We were so unsatisfied that we had to bring it to the attention of the house and had a chat with the manager. He apologized and blamed it on the 20-person party they had on the cocktail patio. I didn't understand that or accept it. He offered dessert, I wasn't interested. He did comp our appetizer from the bill but I still feel it wasn't enough. We came for a special occasion and it was bad. We weren't treated with care or hospitality. The Barrymore left me bewildered. I won't be giving it a second chance or recommending it",

    "text": "Excellent meal. Great service. Beautiful restaurant.   I came here with a party of four and we all had a great time. Of what we ordered, I tried:  Seafood Appetizer Platter Bone in Rib-Eye Curried Squash Steak Tartare Mashed Potatoes Asparagus  Roasted Mushrooms  The appetizer platter included muscles, oysters, jumbo shrimp, crab legs, and lobster tail. The entire selection was chilled and deliciously fresh.   My husband ordered the Bone In Ribeye medium rare. The steak was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was excellent. Based on the excellent reviews, I was planning to order the Short Rib, but the Curried Squash caught my eye and I opted for it instead. It did not disappoint!  Next time I plan to try the Short Ribs. My girlfriend ordered the Steak Tartare as her entree. I had a couple tastes of it and it was good, though I'm generally not a fan. The portion was huge and she commented that there was so much of it she kinda got tired of eating it.  We concluded this was because, as an appetizer, it was probably meant to share.   Of the sides, the Roasted Mushrooms were definitely the star. The Mashed Potatoes were creamy and tasted great. The asparagus was pretty standard.   For dessert I had a very yummy Moscow Mule! It came in the most adorable mug.   A couple notes...Wednesday features a very talented lounge singer which is super fun. The wine list here is outstanding so, if you are a fan of upscale vino, this is your spot.  At about $100 per person, the menu may seem pricey to some especially given the location of this restaurant. In my opinion, you are getting what you pay for in terms of food quality, service, and ambiance.   Can't wait to return!",

We also had the mashed potatoes which were pureed with a lot of flavor. Their wine list is extensive and they had a wine advisor available to help with your selection.

The lobby is whimsical and quirky, with a multicolored piano and a shuffleboard table.  When you open the door to the Barrymore, prepare to be even further amazed. It is dark, artfully decorated, intimate, and perfect for a date night. There is a gorgeous patio with fire pits and heat lamps, as well. This is not a large restaurant, so I would imagine that it gets rather busy on weekends, as we had a 7p reservation on a Wednesday night and still had a 10-15 minute wait.  The service was impeccable, our server was friendly, but not too casual, and offered great suggestions and displayed a great knowledge of the menu.  The food- amazing! From the bread basket, to the grilled octopus, to the steak, to the salmon, it was all beautifully presented, perfectly cooked, and delicious. The prices were also very fair based on the quality of the meal, and the portions were just right. And even though we didn't get dessert, the complementary macaroons were just the right sweet touch to end the meal.  I will definitely be back- the Barrymore is top notch!",

I was so glad we made it here this trip! Let's start with my favorite part of our visit: the ambience. Small, unique, classic Vegas. My favorite. Approximately ten tables/booths.  The hub and I ordered the following: 1.  Autumn flowers - cocktail.  Refreshing and delicious. Excellent  2.  Moscow mule. Made just right.  3.  Bone marrow w crostini - not the best I've tasted but not the worst. A little cold and gritty.  4. Caesar salad. Hub ordered. Average Caesar salad. 5.  Seafood platter - petite. We shared this. It was a minimum amount of seafood for the cost. Very fresh though. An assortment of oysters, muscles, lobster, shrimp, crab.  We had a party of six and gratuity was included. Our waiter's demeanor changed (and not in a good way) when we did not want to order dessert. Between us six, I'm thinking our bill was at least $500.  Not a bad night for him, I thought. Why four stars?  Food was good not great. I really enjoyed the ambiance. That's what gave this place a four in my book.  A definite must- see/experience.",

Yes, it's off the strip and attached to the Royal Resort Yes, it's small and intimate. Yes, they have good steaks and lobster mac. And Yes, The Barrymore is a great place to take a date or celebrate a special evening.   My girlfriend and I chose The Barrymore to celebrate our one year together. We wanted to go somewhere that was good, intimate enough for some quality time, and a place that we haven't been to.  The Barrymore fit just right.  We had reservations, which really wasn't needed since we were the only ones here when we started our dinner.  Our server was fantastic.  Our server made it a point to give full descriptions of everything on their menu, especially their steaks. He even brought out a raw steak just to show us the size of it before it was cooked. I had my eye on their Filet Mignon since I learned about the Barrymore, but ended up with their bone-in-filet.  My dish was pretty good. I'm not saying it was the best steak I've had, but it definitely wasn't the worse. It was still tasty, tender, and my portion was huge. I only regret that I didn't stick with the filet mignon, which in my opinion, tends to have more flavor.  Regardless, I was still satisfied with my meal. My girlfriend was satisfied with her meal as well, but thought that their lobster mac was missing something. We just couldn't figure out what.    Overall, I would suggest The Barrymore to anyone looking for an intimate dinner, a good steak, and great service.   PS:  Can't forget about their bread basket.  One word....delicious!!",

We were seated right away in a nice intimate booth.  We started with the grilled octopus which was the star of the night. Tender, charred with good compliments of sauce and beans. We both ordered the dry aged steak. Mine was cooked perfect medium rare, my husbands was a little under done. Over all decent flavor. We had sides of brussle sprouts which were OK and creamed corn with lobster which was excellent! We also had a bottle of wine from their 50 under $50 list. Very happy with our Merlot choice.  It all came to $200 without tip. A decent price for a quality meal.",

He claimed it was on the web site, IT WAS NOT (still isn't).  However, he spoke to the manager, and since it was our first visit, they allowed us the discount, so thanks for that.  The food was outstanding; the seafood platter was great, nice Caesars salads, bacon apps, lobster mac & cheese and octopus.  The steaks were cooked perfectly and the lobster was nice and firm and buttery.  My brother really likes the steak sauces, and that they were very cheap ($2 each).  The smoked dessert was rather unique. The service started off excellent, but waned a bit, as a large party was seated and the staff was stretched a bit thin.  We will visit this place again!",

This place seems to cater to an older crowd so I am surprised they have only barstool height seating. They do offer a patio which is rather tight and seems to collect all of the smoke from people outside the hotel. If you are here for happy hour and detest bar stools this is your option.  The meh, the food was just ok, especially for the price.  The good, uncomfortable seating aside the place has a great atmosphere. The service is friendly and excellent. The drink specials are great. The singer providing live entertainment was talented and engaging.   If they would bring back some of the regular height seats in some of the yelp pictures this could easily be a 4 star regular hangout.",

My bf and I sat at the bar and ordered Oysters Rockefeller, thick cut bacon, and bone marrow off the happy hr menu and foie gras and creme bulee off the regular menu. Our favorites were definitely the oysters and foie gras. Live entertainment was very pleasant and it was surprisingly quiet on a Sunday night. Even though we mostly ordered off the happy hour menu, the total ended up being over $100 which I think is a bit pricey for the amount of food we got.",

However, our waiter and the food failed to impress.  I ordered off the restaurant week menu (this became an annual tradition), the hubs did not find anything he wanted off of it and ordered steak off the regular menu. Restaurant week menu had two options, $50 and $80 fixed. Though the $80 offered steak, it was paired with lobster mash. The hubs is not a fan of seafood (insanity!).  My RW pick included: Sashimi duo - quite good! Fish tasted fresh and flavors mixed well.  Chicken Mole - unseasoned chicken breast that was tender and I guess was made to receive its flavor from the mole it laid on.  Tiramisu- took it to-go, pretty creamy and enjoyable.  Hubs got Filet Mignon that was also not seasoned, and mash potatoes. While eating, he gave me a list of places where he had better steak and mash.  We shared asparagus, which was great. Also not seasoned but it had a grilled flavor.  I enjoyed El Diablo and Paloma cocktails - both Tequila based.  If the food was as impressive as the decor, our experience would have been 5+ stars! A True let down however, was the service. Our waiter did not acknowledge my husband at all. Any time he came to our table, he spoke directly to me. He only asked ME how the food was and whether I'd like a drink. It was quite ridiculous! It was interesting to hear a table next to us be read the specials of the day after our food arrived. We were not given the same courtesy.  My husband gave his own take as to why he was treated differently, I will not mention it here.  Needless to say, we won't be back.",

After reading tons of good things about The Barrymore, we booked it for a family vacation and Christmas Day dinner- all 8 of us were extremely disappointed- The service staff was disinterested at best. Timing very off....but most of all, the food was lackluster to say the least- undercooked and \" fishy\" tasting crab cake...tough and tasteless short rib.....fishy tasting and tiny lobster special....tasteless gnocchi appetizer...and inedible special dessert. From start to finish we were disappointed and sad that we chose to eat here. It is not inexpensive! I don't understand who is giving this place good reviews- we have had many good meals during our week in Las Vegas, sadly, this was not one of them. The Barrymore charges top dollar for tasteless lackluster amateur good. Don't go. Trust me",

You would never guess that such a cute and upscale restaurant would be inside of an old hotel.   The food was good but the service was a bit lacking. We sat for 20 minutes without being greeted. When we were greeted we had questions about the drinks and while they were answered we were told we would be given a minute but that turned into 20. So 40 minutes before even placing a drink order was a bit much.   We shared a Caesar salad, lobster macaroni and cheese, bone in rib eye, baked truffle potato and the Brussels sprouts. The food was good but it was not my favorite.   Had we had better service we would probably return. This place was on our list of places to try and now we can say that we have.",

    "text": "The Barrymore is ridiculously great. If your looking for great food, service with a touch of romance and old school Vegas, this is the place.   Ambience:  On the outside, it looks like your standard off the strip Hotel (basic with nothing special). When you walk into the restaurant, you seriously are transported to a different time in Vegas. Back when gangsters ran the place and dinner was quiet and intimate without all the neon and the celebrity chef's.   Food:  I've been here twice and I can recommend the lobster Mac and cheese and the fillet mignon. The chunks of lobster in the Mac and cheese are massive.   Service: Everytime I've come, Luis has served us. He is without a doubt one of the best waiters I've had in my life. Easily top 3. He does everything in his power to make your night special, sometimes even without you knowing it, till you get that check.   Cost:  Not going to lie, it's pricey. Party of 2 with a drink each can easily run you $150. That being said, it is 100% worth it.   Tip:  After your done eating, I suggest you take an Uber or Lyft back to your next location as no taxi's are out front.",

    "text": "Just wow from the food to the service.   THE AMBIANCE:   The Barrymore is one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. It has been some time since I went back but the memory of my experience there is forever engraved. The Barrymore is elegant, fine dining. Their wine cellar is beautiful and you will want one in your own home. The dining room decor is classic and enchanting. You feel like you're part of the high rollers club surrounded by metallic accents, blue hues, and dim lighting. Movie reels decorate the ceiling. If you want some natural air you can relax in the patio with a fire pit and Mediterranean-style pillows. It almost felt like a scene out of Aladdin. Loved everything about this place.   THE FOOD:  I was in town on a business trip and decided to treat myself. The food was phenomenal. I ordered the Grilled Octopus appetizer (merguez sausage, green lentils, sherry, red onion, romeaco sauce, herbs, $17) and it blew my mind. Wow! It was an explosion of flavor throughout and the octopus was so tender. The dish tasted was unbelievable and the octopus was plated beautifully. For my entree I tried their Short Beef of Rib (parsnip puree, baby root vegetables, granny smith apples, $33) with a side of mashed potatoes ($8). The beef was tender and the vegetables were caramelized. For dessert I had their apple creme brulee with an apple chip. It was sooo good. The best creme brulee I have ever had. Sour and sweet at the same time. Dinner was fantastic and I cannot wait to go back.   THE CUSTOMER SERVICE:  I was by myself so I dined at the bar. Both the bartender and the host were very welcoming and we had a great time chatting it up all night. I don't remember their names but the bartender appears in one of the videos I am posting and the host was a Latino man, I think his name was Carlos, and he was so kind; he gave me a tour.   THE TIPS: The octopus appetizer is a must have if they have it on the menu. It was my favorite dish. There is mirror with the restaurant logo that hangs in the bar area. Story goes that it was originally a floor plate at a residence and when the residence burned down, it was recovered unscathed by the flames and placed in the restaurant. Pretty awesome.",

Even in the relative quiet, the ambience is beautiful - stunning decor and great service. We had the foie gras appetizer with prickly pear and pomegranate gastric, the bone marrow appetizer (delicious with the toast), char siu pork chop, and the short rib. The pork chop was absolutely an elevated dish, but simultaneously harkened back to childhood takeout orders of bbq spare ribs. The short rib melted in my mouth, perfectly cooked. I wholeheartedly recommend a trip out to this spot.",

Being a new local, I wanted to try a steak house off the normal hustle and bustle of the strip and The Barrymore provided that experience. The food was top notch and the cocktails were strong and boozy which is a good combo. The restaurant is located on the lower level of a hotel, but the hotel is mellow and not another annoying casino. Thus making this spot a good get away for locals but still conveniently located.",

    "text": "I had dinner at the Barrymore as part of a Birthday/Mother's Day outing with my family. I must say that dinner was outstanding. The restaurant is decorated in a Old Hollywood fashion with what appears to be film reels on the ceiling - very chic! The Bar area and waiting area are small but there is plenty of seating through out, so you don't feel as if you're piled on top of one another.   On to the food: The short-rib was so tender you could cut it with a fork, it was served with small potatoes, carrots and a red wine glaze. The Creamed Spinach ( there are two options) was prepared so well with out being too soupy or the spinach to stringy. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was great, I'm not a fan of seafood in my Mac and Cheese, but this dish gets a pass- it was really good. Other items that my party dined on were:  Cream corn w/ Lobster and Bacon, Muscovy Duck, Jidori Chicken  and Miso Marinated Sea Bass - from the reactions at the table they were all excellent.    As for Drinks: The Watermelon martini was a hit all around at our table - it was light and refreshing with just the right mix of Watermelon Liqueur and Watermelon Vodka not too sweet and not too strong - Perfect!.     The service was fabulous -  our waitress Kendra was an absolute delight. She provided excellent service and ensured that our Birthday celebration ended on a sweet note ( We had cake!).",

We ordered the snapper and shared it.  It was succulent.  The vandouvan squash curry dish was great.  I am usually not a fan of curry, but this dish wasn't over the top spicy.  Our mushrooms and asparagus were wonderful as well.  We cheated with the chocolate cake dessert and I'm so happy we did.  It was delicious.    It didn't seem like we had a lot of food for what we ordered, but it ended up being the right amount.  We didn't feel gluttonous!  We dined in the room with the reels on the ceiling.  It had more character than the other dining room.  We will be back!!!",

I had been wanting to come here for awhile so he secretly made reservations...awwww, I know haha They had a prix fix menu but we didn't get it. We just decided to get other things on the menu that we wanted. We were sick of red meat so we opted for the fish items. I had gotten the salmon and he had gotten the sea bass. We also got lobster mac and cheese, sauteed spinach, and one other item I can't for the life of me remember. The food had all come out at once which I like because I have a tendency to get full on whatever comes out first. The fish was SO good. My salmon came wtih some type of salad with asparagus and a yummy sauce. The top of the salmon was crispy mmmm. The sea bass also came with some type of salad and it was equally as good. OH!! We had also gotten a salad to start off because we were starving - something light because as I said, I get full on whatever comes out first haha We had also ordered some drinks. I would recommend just getting something on the rocks if you want to catch a buzz. I had gotten some cocktails but they tasted like juice to me - I'm not an alcoholic I swear but they weren't as strong as I wanted. For dessert, we had gotten this chocolate pudding type concoction with nuts inside and holy hell, it was soooooooooo good. I ate it fairly quickly so I could eat more than my boyfriend...LOL   This is a really cute date place, the inside decor is old school, they play nice old school music, and the bathroom is really nice. I would definitely come again!",

Our server Bill was friendly, attentive and super knowledgable. All of the food was tasty, with the short-rib being the highlight.  We could easily get a reservation on a busy Friday night.

I got the short ribs, which were hands down the best I've ever had.  I would have licked the plate if I could, the sauce was so good.  My boyfriend had the duck confit, which was served over farro, and it was also excellent.  Both our cocktails were great as well.

The patio was constantly inundated with cigarette smoke, the steak was overcooked, the service was seldom there to fill glasses or other things. It was a mediocre meal at a price twice or three times the quality justified. While some of that is Las Vegas, there are much better meals at much better prices.

We got a great assortment of breads, my fave was the pretzel roll, which was to die for. I got the Chilean sea bass for $35, which was amazing. Some of my friends who ordered other meals weren't as satisfied. One friend got the chicken which she said wasn't nothing special and same for the curry dish.   Now here's where I have my complaint. This place IS expensive so if coming here plan on spending quite a bit. All the drinks are pretty much $12 on up. My 1st was a pomegranate martini, very tasty and $15. I ordered a glass of pinot noir at dinner and when brought to me I thought he was giving me a taster. That's how little a pour it was. Probably about 4oz, definitely no more than that. And when I looked down the table at others who had already been sipping on theirs, it looked like they might have gotten an adequate pour, which is 6oz. I asked the manager and he said my glass was what they pour but I complained so they gave me about an ounce more. I figure if I'm paying for a $15 glass of wine I deserve as much. Also its funny there were 2 pinots on the menu. I only saw 1 which was $13 but they waiter didn't ask so he gave me the $15 one so when I got the bill I thought they charged me for my extra pour. Now what's also funny, one of my friends at other end of table got a 2nd glass of wine, he got a double pour, about 10oz!!. Hilarious! I want to just say, I recently went to the Wine bar at Tivoli where their wines were $14-16 per glass but at least gave a nice 8oz pour.  I will say we had a huge party and the staff was very efficient, friendly and I appreciated that they separated all our bills.",

We finished off the last hour of the party with the sliders and chicken fingers, which were also a huge hit.  My guests were incredibly impressed with the quality of food, especially given that it was a large cocktail party.  My bf and I ate there a few times before we had the party and based off those experiences decided to have the party there.  If we had had the party somewhere else, like a restaurant on the strip it would have cost thousands more.  Some of our guests were a little put off when they first got to the Royal Resort, but were blown away when they got into the restaurant.  The service was impeccable as always.  Even when we had only gone there a few times before the party the GM, hostess and bartenders already knew our names.  I recommend this restaurant for regular dining but also for large parties.  Sometimes smaller local restaurants struggle with executing larger party's, but that was definitely not the case here.",

Moved on to the retro Sinatra-inspiring dining room.  Then had excellent service by Israel and nice wine list.  The food was really good, too.  I tried the lobster mac & cheese, which I liked. I really liked the panzanella salad.  We then went to the main bar, which was a scene out of Pulp Fiction. We danced to some music I have never heard before and enjoyed some great people watching.  I would definitely recommend another evening at this place.",

    "text": "My wife booked us a reservation here late last year, and I must admit I was a bit skeptical heading into the outing.  I'm used to dining within the various casinos at a variety of restaurants with top notch chefs and glitz and glamor, but this place was well off the strip in a hotel I had never heard of.  Expecting a typical steakhouse, when I saw the menu I knew I had to try a number of the appetizers.  The seared foie gras was excellent and the fried calamari was fresh and not greasy at all.  Also, they brought out some bacon cherry infused bread that was extremely good as well.  Since I had eaten steak the night before, I ordered the steakburger, which was very reasonably priced.  While it looked good on the menu (Gruyere cheese, bacon marmalade and some kind of tomato), I thought it would be like any other burger.  Oh my, how I was mistaken!  Similar to the experience of enjoying a great movie you had never seen previews for or heard anything about, I was immediately blown away after my first bite.  I'm very much a good burger lover, and this was by far the best all around burger I have ever had!  It had a soft sponge type bun that didn't get soggy, a very full and juicy patty that was ground sirloin, amazing cheese, and the best tomato that was somehow pureed and grilled?  All these flavors combined into a juicy treat that formed a completely unique flavor of burger.  Adding in their special steak sauce at the end was the kicker.    I am actually somewhat saddened as I write this review that I won't be able to have another one until my next trip to Vegas, however I will most likely be booking that very soon.  Kudos to a very friendly, accommodating and knowledgeable staff that made the experience all the better.  This place is my new favorite Vegas restaurant.",

    "text": "I had dinner at The Barrymore last night and it was the best meal I think I've ever had in Las Vegas, and that is saying a lot. It's also reasonably priced for this level of dining. My fiance and I each had an entree, a drink, we split a salad, appetizer and a desert and the bill was just under $100. The food was perfection--nicely balanced and not overdone and very creative. The best thing at The Barrymore may be free: the bread they serve. I especially loved the bacon and cherry roll.   We started off with the grilled artichoke--a must have. We just had the regular house salad, and I wish all house salads everywhere had this much creativity put into them. The dressing is light and savory, and there was also shaved fennel and some of the freshest grape tomatoes I've eaten in Vegas.   I had the swordfish, which was $22 and served on a bed of fresh fava beans with Brussel sprouts. Everything was cooked just right. My fiance had a special: pasta bolognese. The pasta is fresh and the sauce, authentic.     They also have a good wine list and affordable wines by the glass, but if you like the hard stuff, try their specialty drink, The Barrymore, which is what my fiance had. I had the Au Bon Climate pinot noir, which was about $12-definitely worth it.   We loved it all: the decor, ambiance wine, service and the price.  I looking forward to many happy dining experiences at The Barrymore.",

My fiance and I were visiting Las Vegas for our 4 year anniversary and decided to do a nice dinner out. This was the place recommended to us, and we were more than impressed! the food selection is great - it is a 2 page menu, so it is not overwhelming, and every dish on there is worth trying. I had a ceasar salad and he had the grilled artichoke salad - very delicious, unique flavor.  The bread they bring is AMAZING - they have a cranberry-bacon  bread, and it really the best bread I have ever had (though the combination maybe doesn't sound good, it really is!).  Drinks - we initially were not going to order any, but then our waiter brought us complementary glasses of champagne. Very attentive staff, my water glass was always full, and the food came quickly. For the main course I ordered the salmon and my fiance ordered a steak topped with foie gras (he said it was the best steak he ever had, even compared to Del Friscos and other steak houses). AMAZING! the salmon came with a squash puree, which nicely complemented the richness of the salmon. We also got a side of mushrooms and grilled asparagus - again, perfectly cooked. For desert, we split a creme brulee - one of the best I have ever had!  If you are trying to find a nice place to eat in Vegas, you MUST CHECK THIS PLACE OUT! Truly a hidden gem. You won't regret it!",

This place is awesome. Nestled right off strip in the Royal Resort (kind of a cool boutique hotel, also), this restaurant is top quality and comparable to the high end strip restaurants. Starting at the valet, service was excellent and friendly. The restaurant is dark and retro, it was very quiet. The decor is beautiful. We were early for our reservation but were seated immediately and had the whole room to ourselves! Emily was our server and she was super friendly and prompt. The menu was amazing- our food was absolutely delicious! It was my fiance's birthday and Emily brought us out complimentary little cookies- so sweet! We also told her we were thinking about having our rehearsal dinner here in April and she was so excited and provided us with info to get in touch with their group sales manager. Once getting back home, we set up our reservation to have our rehearsal dinner- the manager was incredibly responsive via email. This place is seriously one of the best restaurants I've been to in Vegas. It plays homage to the classic Old Vegas, Rat Pack days, and I just love it!",

We also had the range free chicken and ny strip steak. We finished off the meal with the warm chocolate cake.

So I ordered a filet mignon with a size foie gras and beef bone marrow.  My husband also ordered the Chilean seabass.  The price is reasonable considering it is a high end restaurant in Vegas.  The filet was $43 plus $19 foie gras add on and $16 for two pieces of bone marrow with crusty bread.  The Chilean seabass was pretty soft and I thanked them for that!  I didn't get the Yelp check-in free wine because my husband and I don't drink but that's a tip for those of you do.  We asked for steak sauce and the server brought us three kinds of sauce in little containers.  But the server didn't let us know that there was extra charge for $5.   I think I would appreciate if I was told there is extra charge because you never know how much it would be.    Overall the environment was okay and the food was decent.  The only thing I wish for is a bigger portion.  Especially that little piece of foie gras.  It was way too little.  I rather pay more to eat a bigger piece.",

It's a small steak house tucked away in the motel-like Royal Resort.  There are 10 tables in the restaurant area, and the menu screams classic steak house. Service is wonderful and attentive, as one would expect from a high-end steak restaurant. They also have specials like the \"Dean Martin\" (which included filet mignon and lobster tail) which just reinforces their Oldies throwback :)  Onto the food. I hate to say, but I've definitely had better steak. The filet mignon I ordered was a little chewy, although it was cooked appropriately to medium, and it was not juicy :(  They do have lobster mac n cheese, which was rich and creamy and delicious, and they had a very common caesar salad. Their shrimp cocktail was quite impressive in size (3 very large shrimps) but overall, for the $$, I was unimpressed with the food quality.   Next time I'd just come here for HH, enjoy the outside patio/ cool bar area and eat some apps.  It's a great spot for a date night or if you want to impress your boss ;)",

The sides are served family style and we ordered everything from the lobster mac n cheese, the corn, asparragus (there wwas mushrooms, but I hate mushrooms).  Every side dish was excellent and we ended up ordering extra spinach.  I brought in Sprinkles cupcakes for the birthday girl and waas saddened to have the $5 a person charge for bringing our own desert in. That was going to cost more than the cupcakes alone!  However, our waiter was awesome and dinged that charge because hey, we drank our faces there and dumped a ton of money.  Thanks!!!

Then our server Ashley gave us wonderful recommendations and was very knowledgeable about the food and cocktails and was really relaxed, in no way trying to rush us, even though we were obviously going to be her last table. When our steaks came out the were a bit over cooked and I was super embarrassed to say anything but Ashley walked up to the table and instantly saw them and said they were over cooked for what we had asked for and took them back to the kitchen, again, no questions asked. Then the manager came out and very unexpectedly took the steaks off the bill and was very apologetic. When they did bring the steaks back they were perfect and and all of the sides and the cocktails that were recommended were delicious. And Ashley was a gem the entire time even though we were the last people in the restaurant. Absolutely will return and try some of the other cuts and sides. We were very happy with everything.",

It is a True hidden gem in the Royal Resort.  Arrived and got seated right away.    Service was great here.  The manager (or who looks to be the manager) came check on us a few times to make sure we are happy with our food and service.  Our water was always filled and the server check on us often as well.  They truly take the extra mile to make sure you are happy with your meal and service here.  Items we ordered:  Miso Marinated Sea Bass - Yums!  The sea bass is cook and flavored to perfection.  The season was just perfect that you can still taste the sea bass.  Cream Corn and Lobster - This is probably my favorite dish.  Not as creamy but it is perfect.  Delicious dish that I recommend.  Lobster Mac-n-Cheese - Another delicious dish.  I would say that this is one of the best I've had.  Very creamy and cheesy with chunks of lobster.    Will definitely come back to this place and try other items on the menu next time I visit Vegas.",

    "text": "This review is for 3.5 stars  The vibe of the Barrymore is very old school.  It has that original Las Vegas feel which is very cool and different from the usual flashy-ness of new Vegas.  It is located in the Royal Resort.  We sat in a very small room that had about 4 different dining parties on a saturday night; very slow.  We began the meal with a good selection of bread and by sharing a seafood platter.  I highly recommend the seafood platter as an appetizer.  I think it came with 6 oysters, 2 lobster tails, 6 shrimp, and a few other seafood offering.  The shrimp in particular were humongous and very meaty.  One person I dined with had a steak and the other had the french onion soup and a salad.  I went with curry with a side of grilled asparagus.  My meal and the quality of the food were very solid.  I heard good things about my other dining members' meals as well.  The manager came over a few times to check up on us (not sure if this is usual or just because it was a slow night).  I liked that he conversed with his patrons; very old school.  Overall, I really liked my meal.  I just do not think the high cost matches the quality of the food.",

We ordered a Caesar salad and lobster Mac and cheese. Salad was bad, but the server did realize he gave me the wrong salad. We were sitting across from the kitchen and we can hear the cooks and servers yelling at each other. When our main course came out, my steak was cooked right on but my wife's steak was supposed to be a Medium Well came out as a Medium Rare and was burnt to a crisp on the outside. I'm not sure why the server never came back to check on us probably because his busser dropped a bunch of plates and the manager came to fill up our waters and never even asked if everything was ok. Which was embarrassing on their part. We sat their for a good 15 minutes, no exaggeration I ate half of my steak and my wife picked at hers before the busser asked if everything was ok. I asked for our server and when he finally showed up and asked us how everything LOOKS, we were both ready to leave. My wife expressed her feelings about her steak and it was almost like the server already new she was unhappy. I give him credit though for dropping off the check quickly.  Good job on that part but we will never be back to visit.",

    "text": "We brought a couple friends here who we thought would really enjoy the vibe. We'd been here once before and really enjoyed ourselves. Unfortunately for that evening, we were not notified that there would be a wedding that took over the entire dining room so we were seated in a little room off to the side of the bar.  Definitely a huge disappointment.  Service was also a very big let down.  Because our table was small, it did not have room for our wine bottles or water bottles.  They kept water in a chiller behind us and the wine in some hallway on one side of the room.  Water was filled slightly more often than the wine but towards the end when they got busy, we went thirsty.  Our wine glasses sat empty for long stretches.  Even when the snooty unhelpful manager dude would pass by, we'd still go thirsty.  So it appeared that they only had one server for that entire room which consisted of a party of 14, a couple two-tops and another 4 or so four-tops.  There were a couple bus boys bustling around but otherwise, after it got busier, we got ignored.  The food started out good (when it wasn't so busy).  We got the large seafood tower, king crab cocktail and lobster mac and cheese.  These items were pretty tasty and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves...happy that we were kicking off in good fashion.  Unfortunately, from there it was all downhill. Although our friends raved about their entrees (filet mignon rare and sea bass), hubby and I were not happy with ours.  I ordered the ribeye and hubby went with the NY strip.  After a bite of the steak, I thought something was off.  I put my finger on the steak and realized that it was barely warm.  Same for hubby's!  All our sides came and the sauteed mushrooms were cold.  Nothing else was really hot!!  Worse yet, our steaks were underseasoned and mine was so full of gristle I stopped eating it halfway through, feigning a full stomach.  Should we have paid double and gotten the \"Reserve\" steaks?!  At this point, I felt like they served us leftover wedding food.  By this time, I was worn out by how disappointing the evening had been.  It took us forever to get out of there...trying to find our server, get the check, get our cards run, etc. I didn't want to put up a fuss with our friends present but we could tell that towards the end, they too were also getting short on patience.  Frankly, I get the feeling they are struggling.  When we arrived, the Royal Resort was deserted.  Their hip lobby lounge had nary a soul hanging out on a Saturday night and the bar was emptied out, shut down which was a stark contrast to how lively it was when we last visited.  The hotel's decline may be affecting this place's business.    Needless to say, I think we've seen The Barrymore for the last time.",

The chef is hands down amazing! I ordered the filet mignon. It was tender, crusty, juicy and flavorful! My side, the parmesan risotto, was hands down the best I've had. Hubby's 18 oz bone in ribeye had us both salivating before the plate hit the table!!!!! It was cooked medium well to perfection. The juices flowed out as he cut freely into every piece. The cream corn and lobster with bacon that he paired as a side definitely disappoint. If you're in the area, it's a must stop. I tell you, you don't expect to get THIS when you walk into this hotel. We couldn't be more pleased!!!!!! Perfect place for a birthdya",

    "text": "Truly a hidden gem. Off the Vegas strip and in a hotel that no one's ever heard of. When you step into the Barrymore you are immediately taken back to a bygone time. The velvet booths, the movie reel-covered ceiling, and the dim lighting feels like a Dick Tracy 1920s speakeasy. The night we dined there was a live singer at the bar. Her notes and melody carried into the dining room and made the scene even more magical.   The menu is typical Americana - appetizers, steaks, sides, etc. Their drink menu is inventive, both in name and in mix. Wine list is extensive with notable bottles in their collection. We wanted to try many of their dishes so we ordered most of their appetizers and no main entree. Can't find any complaints with any of their dishes. The shining stars would be the bone marrow, grilled octopus, foie gras, and the dessert - Chizu, a Japanese cloud cheesecake.   What a great find! If you are a foodie and Vegas is your next destination be sure to add the Barrymore to your list of must-eats!",

I bet this place is packed during convention time.  I love anything and everything Old Vegas and this restaurant has that vibe. Love the decor. It's super trendy & Quaint. The Live music (in the lounge) that played throughout the restaurant is a nice touch. I definitely see myself coming back and bringing friends.   The Lounge is on the smaller side but, they do have a nice outdoor area that extends off the lounge which I can see myself out there once it cools down a little.   Our table enjoyed the Chilled Seafood Platter, Crab & Cream Cheese Wontons (A Special Item that night), Caesar Salad, Filet Mignon, Asparagus & Twice Baked Potato. All the food was great but, I'd like to point out that the Caesar Salad was the best I've had.   We had a Sundae for dessert. A suggestion for the restaurant would be to add the verbiage  \"build your own\" Sundae to the menu description as it might be more enticing. Although... It was a nice surprise for my son once he saw he got to add all the toppings himself.   If I had to find something wrong with this wonderful experience it would be the Missing Cheesecake on the dessert menu. We really enjoy a Cheesecake to share after a nice dinner, ha",

This spot is based in the Royal Resort Hotel, which was a bit odd... It's not on the strip and the whole neighborhood is pretty quiet. It feels a little creepy, to be honest, though I think that's the vibe this boutique was going for.   The restaurant itself, however, was marvelous. The decor was vintage, and ambiance relaxing. Service was incredible the entire night, as our server effectively balanced our party of 8, with a wedding party that came in with about ~20 people. I was really impressed.  The wine list was solid, and we ordered a few bottles to share with the table. Lobster Mac & Cheese was the appetizer, along with complimentary bread. I didn't have the mac (shellfish allergy) but reviews were positive.  For mains, everyone got the porterhouse, which is the \"signature\" dish. You can add on mushrooms, foie gras, etc if you'd like. It's a LOT of food... like a LOT a LOT, so probably better to split for two people. For that reason, I opted for the filet, which was delicious, and more appropriately portioned. I added foie gras on top, and am glad I did. For sides we ordered asparagus, mashed potatoes, and Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were the best of the bunch - the other two weren't particularly memorable. I know they also have a truffle baked potato, which I would probably try if I ever returned.  Keep in mind, this place is a steakhouse, and doesn't have great options for vegetarians (salmon for pesca's).  Overall, I was really satisfied with our meal. The restaurant is very close to the convention center, if you find yourself in town for something like CES. Great spot for a date, passing time with friends, or dinner with parents. Definitely not a spot for kids. Price was fair, about ~$100 pp for 1 main, side, and wine for everybody. Dress skews toward business casual, though I don't think they'd deny anybody on that premise. Great work!",

Very much enjoyed the cuisine, ambiance and wine list. Would never imagine it to be like this. Stopped in on the way to the Venetian to shop, Peppermill to cocktail, and Stratosphere to view from above. Add this gem to your walking Vegas experience. Different than south of the strip for sure.

The service was impeccable and everyone was so attentive.  Being a local and frequenting steakhouses I have to say definitely my favorite by far.  We will be back!!!",

I didn't feel like I was in Vegas, I felt like I was in a 1930's film.  Our waiter from the beginning was very accommodating and he had a REAL sense of humor, not fake at all. Started off with some cucumber mojitos that were light and refreshing...cool as the cucumber muddled in it. I ordered the Dungeness Crab appetizer thinking I was going to have to do some work, however all of the meat was placed neatly on top of a delicious gazpacho type sauce that I thoroughly enjoyed. I even took my spoon and ate the remaining sauce like it was a soup.  For my main I ordered the Vadouvan Squash Curry w/ couscous.  I was impressed with the curry flavor, it wasn't too heavy, but it wasn't light either.  I wondered if there was a bit of coconut milk in it.  Regardless, I ate it ALL! It was time for dessert and I was so full, but I HAD to order something so I went with the Pistachio ice cream- by the way all of their ice cream is house made.  If you like pistachios, you will like this. The Barrymore is off the beaten path, which appealed to me because I really didn't feel like eating at a crowded pretentious restaurant.  Be prepared to spend a lot of money, it is kind of pricey, but it's worth it.",

He had another bottle in his hand he said was a wine of similar style. Stupidly, we said OK. It was not very good.  We had the shrimp cocktail. Not as good as we remember.The shrimp was OK and the sauce was fairly bland and mild. I remember it having some heat last time.  My guest had the sea bass. We were underwhelmed. I had a $48(!) steak. Ok, but very dry. not worth anywhere near the price, but I guess that's the going rate in Vegas.  Waiter really pushed the creamed corn w/ lobster. We had the lobster mac and cheese last time and it was good. The creamed corn had very little lobster and was, well, creamed corn. My mistake.  On the plus side the bread basket had 3 types of bread which were all delicious.  Nice ambiance except for perhaps the strange piano/singer lounge act performing standards + 70s rock ballads. Weird.  Bill was almost $200. Would give 3 stars but can't do it for these prices. Not planning on going back.",

    "text": "4.8 stars.  Found out after my last trip to Vegas this summer that The Barrymore opened during Labor Day.  Wish I knew then what I know now.  This time I made a reservation way in advance to spend my birthday celebration.    I originally thought I'd treat myself to a birthday dinner at Jose Andres' \"E\" at The Cosmopolitan.  However, after reading the stellar reviews, I would walk away from that experience anywhere from $200-350 none the richer.  It may be all the hype, but I want bang for my buck.    I believe I got a lot of bang out of The Barrymore.  An intriguing find off the Strip, housed in the Royal Resort.  Part hotel and part time share.  Our African taxi driver hadn't heard of the restaurant before, let alone was vaguely familiar with the hotel itself.  We made it fine.  We had no problem being in \"the shadier\" part of town, which many reviews here allude to (not sure why).  Also, the hotel wasn't shady at all.  It's not your grandiose hotel with a billion dollar entrance.  It's pretty much like a Holiday or Days Inn via HGTV makeover with modern touches to hip up the place.  There was a happening bar in the lobby that looked like a great place to chill.  Right off the back I knew I was going to love this place because it's so anti-the Strip and off the beaten path.  A more mellow and humble response to being in Vegas.  Yes, it's possible.    The ambiance was retro cool with an intimate waiting area and a cozy bar that was crowded.  We were brought to our booth in the main dinning room that had rich, velvety wallpaper, ink blotch art work revealing classic actors and the ceiling was decked out with 35mm film reels.  The entire ambiance harked of classic Hollywood.  Ambiance:  5 stars!  Our experienced waiter, Oscar, greeted and checked with us a few times to help with suggestions and highlight popular dishes.  The manager, Brian, took the time to introduce himself and ask our opinions of the restaurant thus far.  Even the bread guy came by and introduced himself.  Actually a great touch that set a more intimate tone and you could tell everyone had a sense of pride in what they were offering.  What the bread guy brought us was just phenomenal!  Among the lavosh, were cranberry & bacon rolls and a Stromboli that was to die for!  Geez, bring me a bottle of wine and a few more of these babies and I'm frickin' set for the night.  Service:  5 stars!  Bread:  5 stars!  Our party of three started with a couple appetizers:  1)  Lobster Mac & Cheese - mascarpone-tallegio cream sauce (5 stars!)  Wow!  You'd think that the lobster flavor would get lost in all the rich creaminess going on; wrong, the flavor was upfront and probably one of the best mac and cheese dishes I've ever tasted; 2)  Pan Seared Foie Gras - vanilla bean french toast, fig & cherry chutney (5 stars!)  Amazing medallions of heaven that paired excellently with the savory sweetness of the chutney; like buttah!  Entrees were:  1)  The Buffalo Rib Eye (3 stars).  Ordered medium rare, things started off fine and tasted great, but ended up being rare to blue rare as you got to the center.  This was my friends' dish and she was impressed with the flavor, but wasn't able to eat most of the overly rare part.  2)  Short Ribs (5 stars!)- carrot mousseline, red pearl onion, bacon marmalade, natural jus.  I love my short ribs and this one was stellar!  Fall apart texture all in a groovealicious reduction sauce.  This went well with the Asparagus Risotto (5 stars!) that I shared with a friend.  3)  The Fillet Mignon that my friend had, he described as \"beautiful\" (5 stars!).    We were totally stuffed by the time dessert came around.  My eyes were way too big for my stomach as I ordered the delectable Creme Brulee that had specks of vanilla bean, glorious in all regards (5 stars!).  A wonderful birthday treat and I'm thrilled I decided to spend it here.  A 360 from the usual, over-the-top Vegas that ended up being the most down to earth experience of the weekend.  Not to be missed!  Come here for the substance so many on the Strip promise.  Tally: Ambiance:  5 stars! Service:  5 stars! Bread:  5 stars! The Buffalo Rib Eye:  3 stars Short Ribs:  5 stars! Asparagus Risotto:  5 stars! Fillet Mignon:  5 stars! Creme Brulee:  5 stars 5+5+5+3+5+5+5+5= 38/8= 4.8 stars.",

However, from what i've tried, I would get the short rib, lobster mac, and cheese corn.  Miso marinaded sea bass: the sea bass was cooked perfectly, it came with rice, bok choy and such.  It was more of a soup(a bit floral or herby which to me was odd but if you like that kind of stuff) with sea bass on top.(not miso glazed)  lobster bisque: again i felt that the flavor was a bit odd  foie gras: was excellent  lobster mac and cheese: 5 stars  corn&lobster(side): Very good  veal sweetbreads: was never a real fan of sweetbreads but this was good  diver scallops: scallops were slightly overcooked but this is was very good  short rib: out of all the dishes i've tried. this to me was the best.(sadly i didnt try any steaks)  chicken and risotto: risotto with the white asparagus was good. for me the chicken was a bit dry.",

Ambiance is the definition of modern classic, and is comfortable while achieving a romanticism that the current trend of hipster restaurants wish they could achieve.  As it is, the real deal in such ways.  The staff is professional, but not so much they forget to be charming.  The somm was particularly nice to talk to about wine, as he was informative while still maintaining cheerful banter.  The food was what I expected for the price point, however it all felt as if it had more promise than realization.  The dishes almost felt as if they were held back in terms of etching out the flavors they wanted to achieve.  More broad strokes than defining signatures, but enjoyable none the less.  Overall, I would recommend to anyone looking for a great dining experience that will excite seasoned and newer diners alike.",

This place reminds me of an extremely nice cigar lounge minus the smoke and odors that has been renovated by a modern designer  =)  The lounge area is very nice area to start off your adventure with a glass of wine or cocktail. They have very comfy seats away from the bar that can be very cozy for two or opened up for small groups.   They have a great sleection of wines and house specialty drinks.   The dinning areas are also very nice!  Try to get a booth if you can, it's the best seat in the house. The food is as equally impressive as the decor. They have an award winning chef at the helm and he is excellent!  We choose to eat in the lounge since it was lunch and had a burger with fries.  The burger is grass fed beef cooked to perfection and the fries were more like frites with herbs and salt. It was delish!  We also had a chicken Cesar salad that was also very good.   This is a great place for either drinks in the lounge or for dinning. They are open for for breakfast, lunch and dinner so give them a try if you're in the area.",

    "text": "Wow! Every aspect of this dinner was simply incredible. My girlfriend and I each were very happy with the entire dining experience and are already planning on returning with friends!  We each started off with a cocktail. I had The Barrymore which featured Gentleman Jack and we both agreed that it was very tasty with mellow notes of whisky followed with a nice citrusy finish, a very manly drink. Amber had the Spring Buzz which featured Hangar one wild blueberry, the taste that I had was very enjoyable no real notes of alcohol just a very fresh taste. I could see myself consuming entirely too many of these around a pool.  We started with the Grilled Octopus which was amazing, I really don't know how to describe this dish it's that amazing!  It is a MUST HAVE for any dinner here.  We then ordered the Pan Seared Foie Gras as our \"second course\" NomNomNom!  We don't always eat delicious delicious goose/duck liver, but I will say this was the best I've ever had. The lovely piece of foie gras looked like it was placed on a super soft piece of bread that was very sweet and would have been great on its own.   We then shared the Spring Lamb Duo which was quite a large plate of tasty lamb parts. The loin was my favorite part of this dish as it was perfectly cooked and went perfectly with the sauce that was on the plate.  The only thing I was unhappy with during dinner was that we didn't have any room for dessert!   Our waitress Emily was amazing!! Thank you so much!! Everyone at The Barrymore was very helpful and friendly.  We can't wait to go back!",

We were there on a Friday at 7pm and the restaurant seemed a little on the empty side. Then dining room was very nice and the service was incredible! There must have been 2 staff members to every person working that night.  We didnt order a entree because we were strickly here for the Frenach onion soup and the Lobster mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was very creamy and wonderful! The french onion was probably the best we have ever had and we eat a lot of it. The broth was really dark and flavorful and the bowl was a decent amount. The bacon bread was pretty darm good too. We were not sure if it would be enough food, but being it was so rich we were both stuffed! The waiter was wonderful and even asked if we wanted more bread.  The only down fall which was my fault for not reading was their Bellini was not blended and i have never heard/tried a non frozen version. it was good, but it was really a tiny amount and not worth the $11. I ended up getting 2 Huge frozen Bellini drinks from fat tuesday on my trip anyways HAHA. This place was excellent and we will be back!",

    "text": "The Barrymore is owned by Block 16 Hospitality which also operates LBS Burger, Holsteins, and Public House. In short, these guys are killing it! I can highly recommend every one of these restaurants.   The Barrymore is in a strange north strip hotel location that is not all that appealing from the outside. Once you get inside the restaurant that all changes. The decor is unique and it has a very nice feel. On the night I was there it was getting a little loud in the main dining room although it was mostly from one large party.   My wife and I both tried one of their speciality cocktails. She had the Harvest which is an an apple cinnamon drink that tasted just like an apple pie. I had the Basil which is a burbon drink with basil and lemon. It was one of the most unique cocktails I have ever had and also one of the most delicious. They also have a 50 under 50 wine list which is great for those of us like me that are pretty ignorant about wine and don't often buy expensive bottles.  I had Lobster Deviled Eggs, a tomato and mozzarella salad (a special that night), and the Short Rib Entree.  The Lobster Deviled Eggs were delicious and topped with a bit of caviar which added a great salty taste. My problem with them was that there was little to no lobster taste. For a $9 egg, I was expecting some lobster chunks.  The salad was amazing. They didn't re-invent anything here, but the dressing was perfect, the tomatos fresh, and the cheese was some of the softest and most delicious mozzarella I have ever eaten. A real winner here, I would order it again if it was on the regular menu.  The Short Rib was a generous portion with carrot mousseline (puree), red pearl onion, bacon marmalade, and natural jus. The meat was for tender and delicious. The pearl onions were pickled which made for an excellent suprise. I don't think I even need to get into the bacon marmalade, it was just as good as you might expect.  Great food, great service, unique cocktails, I'll be back here!",

    "text": "Pre-concert snack with gf a few weeks back.  Sat at the bar and tried a few libations along with the burger and the lobster mac.  Saturday night - around 6ish and we're basically the only people there ( one other guy at the bar drinking a diet coke . ) I get the fact that it's early for weekend dinner in Vegas standards but from what i understand, they are trying to get local biz as much, if not more from the tourist/convention folk so i'm concerned - granted they are just getting started but ... well, enough of the negativity.  I like the place, i like the vibe and i hope this place kicks ass.  The Drinks ?  damned if i remember what they were but they were stiff and cost about $11 ( give or take a $1 .  Sorry, I know, I'm useless )   The food ?  I like that they went ahead and split the burger and fries for us.  And yes, the burger was perfectly cooked AND salted to my liking and i'm glad they used MAYO and the meat tasted great !  I was kinda surprised the burger only cost $13.50 - much cheaper than Holstein's - i gotta believe it's the same meat but dang, i'd swear the meat tastes better at The Barrymore !  The mac and cheese - well, it happened again ! I get sucked into the lobster mac and cheese every time i see it on a menu cause it sounds AWESOME .  But after i start eating it, I bitch about it.  why ?!  Because i feel lobster should either be eaten straight up or with some butter - that's it, that's all .  As much as i liked this mac n cheese, i still feel the lobster gets lost a little and lobster should never get lost !   Service was great, and for sure, i will try again for breakfast and dinner.  sorry, thought i took pics but i screwed up - i video'd the food !",

The fillet mignon was a so-so the meat wasn't as tender as I expected it to be. Side of mushrooms was good, the fat potato fries u can skip.  The bone marrow was good , maybe a bit too buttery. Overall a very nice place with unique decor that is pleasant. If u r nearby, give it a try.",

The bar area is really nice with a good wine selection and lots of vintage cocktails.      The restaurant is really small so if this place gets popular, it's going to be tough to get in.  The appetizers were great - definitely try the lobster mac and cheese!    My chicken entree was also excellent.    Unfortunately,  my husband and one of our friends ordered the Ahi Tuna.    In spite to them asking for it to be as rare as possible, it came way overcooked with that yucky gray color that comes with overcooked tuna.      A big miss for what could have been a 5-star experience.   Service was attentive but not overbearing.  I really like the Barrymore and hope they can make it in their out of the way location.",

    "text": "We had been here last February for Valentines and loved every single thing about it - impeccable service, delicious food, strong drinks....fast forward to Thanksgiving with our family.  5 of us got the set \"traditional\" dinner of Turkey.  Reasonably priced at $48 per person - for 3 courses.  We had reserved well in advance, but still got stuck with the table right at the door of the dining room, in the middle of the room, with the hallway and wine wall as our backdrop - not exactly the best seat in the house - with staff buzzing by constantly.  And the guy sitting to the side taking photos with a flash almost our entire meal - sorry dude that is RUDE, I feel like they should have told him, no flash photography, it was so annoying.  Our waitress was the same one we had in February and the place wasn't that full - so not sure why the service was so average.  She really checked in like a waitress would at Dennys.  And the other attendants were pretty negligent.  My son ordered a bottle of sparkling wine and they only brought out 3 glasses, since 3 people spoke up, that they would have some - when I think they should have just given everyone a glass.  They poured the 3 glasses and then put the bottle behind my son, out of his reach across the walk way and there it sat.  We had 3 empty glasses most of the meal - and despite our repeated stares the staff just walked by - not serving the last of the wine until the end of the meal.  My husband ordered the wine pairing with his meal and they were behind getting the wine out with each course and there was no explanation.  At Valentines the wine steward came over each course and told us what we were drinking.  First course - the pumpkin quail soup - interesting - had a hard time figuring out the proper way to eat a whole quail sitting in the middle of the soup.  When we did get a piece of quail meat off - it was yummy with the pumpkin soup, but the soup wasn't very hot, so it could have been much better.  The soup bowls had a big lid that 3 out of the 4 servings had taken away when the soup was served, but one lid got left on the soup and we didn't know what to do with it.  They never noticed this big white lid sitting on the table!  It should have been removed.  The rolls and bread here are FANTASTIC - we could have just eaten them and been very satisfied!  Turkey, stuffing, puree yams, mashed potatoes, and green beans - all were average - nothing exceptional - meat and stuffing were both dry and all my pieces had ribbons of fat through them.  Never been a yam fan.  Potatoes I love and these were just OK.  Green beans were good.  Gravy came on the side and again was not hot enough to make up for luke warm food.  We mostly took our food home as it seemed a waste to not eat it, but no one was gobbling it down at the restaurant.  My daughter had shrimp pasta - and the shrimp were giant - however they were like rubber!  Auntie and brother both tried the shrimp and said - \"no, not good\" and took no more bites.  The pasta and sauce were fine.  Our ending with pumpkin tart was also not satisfying - but we all love a rich pumpkin pie and this was on the light side.  We might go back or maybe not - there are so many excellent restaurants in the city - and we loved the Barrymore the first time, but you only get one strike in this town and you are out.  Sorry.",

The decor is very hip very cool very intimate...definitely a place I would recommend to bring friends for drinks and tapas. Not for dinner though, and I say this because 6 of us went there for dinner we all ordered different things and the consensus at the end of the night was....\"meh at best\". Halibut was under cooked and had no taste, rib eye was over cooked the chicken was dry and the short ribs definitely a bit salty with way too many carrots!   We did order the lobster mac and cheese that everyone raves about, but again...meh and a bit salty. I did enjoy the watermelon salad but definitely something you don't want to share as the portion is really meant to be enjoyed by two at most.  Would I go back for drinks tapas and to socialize....most def, but not for dinner. Not really worth the price.  Sorry not a winnah winnah chicken dinnah this time.",

I half expected to see Dean Martin or Frankie walk out from behind the flowing iridescent silver/grey curtains.  I love the movie reels on the ceiling, the mood lighting,  the high back, pintuck velvet booths, the pristIne white tablecloths and top notch service. This place is so romantic and oozes with glamour.  It was suggested that we request to be served by Israel and he did not disappoint.  rrom the wine recommendations, to the presentation of each course, to the scraping of the table between each course, he was a class act.  The food was fantastic. My husband is not a foodie but was very adventurous and loved every bite.  We had a yummy beet salad to start and our entree's were Chilean Sea Bass and Filet.  We shared the asparagus and mashed potatoes (I can honestly say that they were just average) but the entree's were worth every penny.    We had dessert (I think it was Tiramisu) and again...delish.  So overall...I would agree with the other reviewers that this is probably one of the best kept secrets in Vegas and I would definitely go here again!  Word to the wise...leave the kiddo's at home..PLEASE!!",

I realized it may be off the beaten path (even our taxi driver didn't know where it was), but it was well worth the trip. I remember every bite.  We made a reservation, and we had to wait a few minutes. The restaurant is extremely sexy and intimate, feels very old school Vegas. Lots of mirrors and blue suede seating. It felt very romantic and cozy.  Our server was very sweet. We had the roasted artichoke (yumm), lobster mac (perfect amount of truffle, I am not a huge truffle fan), braised shortrib (melted), and salmon (my bf said it was the best salmon he has ever had). We also had a pitcher of white sangria which was also very good. The bread that came with the meal was very unique. Bacon and cranberry, awesome!! They even brought out seconds.  Our waitress was nice enough to take a picture of us, which I think says a lot. I will definitely come back to The Barrymore when I am back in town.",

This place feels like old Vegas, the days before the \"Celebrity Chef\" phenomenon sucked all the soul out of Vegas eating establishments. We made a reservation on Open Table for a Saturday night at 8pm and when we arrived we were seated immediately inside the main dining room. The entire restaurant seats 50 so it has a chill vibe that is a welcome relief from the neon Disneyland just outside the doors.    We ordered the Pan Seared Foie Gras, being from California this dish was a must, and the Lobster Mac & Cheese. Both appetizers were pretty good. Not the greatest Lobster Mac I've had but certainly not the worst either, same with the Foie Gras, had much better but again, since I cant have it in CA it was awesome just to be able to order it. For our entrees we had the Duck Confit and Short Rib, both were excellent and pair incredibly well with our wine. I wish I  could remember the name of the bottle we ordered but the Sommelier was definitely on point.

Oh well, luckily the city of sin also has succulent temptations in the way of food.  My sister was hesitant to try it out as the location is a little off the beaten path, but considering we were staying at the Trump it worked out okay.  The luxe booths, dim lighting, and transparent wine wall definitely contrasts the fluorescent lights and white floors of the hotel entrance.    I was very pleased with the selection of cocktails available, offering handcrafted and interesting selections as opposed to the newest twist on a Cosmopolitan.  Thinking back on it, I am pretty sad that I didn't try the Lobster Mac and Cheese.  The waiter gave me some great guiding advice and I liked him so I went with it.  I ended up with Octopus with papas bravas and some sort of aioli.  Literally the most tender and velvety octopus I've ever eaten.  I was in absolute heaven with my Aperol spritzer.      Although my shining review might need to be tempered with the knowledge that I had spent the last three days hiking the Grand Canyon, I still feel that this is a solid and delicious restaurant.",

Here's what I had:   Roasted Artichoke - It was good and tasty. It was artichoke hearts topped with stuff. I'm not sure why but I was expecting more of a halfed or quartered whole roasted/grilled artichoke. Nonetheless I thought it was good.   Panzanella - I did this for my salad. Ehhh.. Not thrilled by it. I'd go with a reg salad if I were to go back. I know Panzanella isn't salad but I was in the mood..   Filet - Cooked perfectly. I did the Bearnaise sauce. I do find it odd and slightly tacky when a steakhouse charges extra for sauce. Classes things down a notch for me. I always remember this place I ate (that will remain nameless) where I ordered a big steak, dinner, the whole thing, and I asked for sour cream on my baked potato and they said .75 cents extra, steak was good but that drove me nuts. Perhaps I have baggage when it comes to this.. but I'm just sayin, it bugs me..   Sides - Sauteed spinach and cream corn lobster. Spinach solid and the cream corn lobster is very buttery rich as you would expect.   We were sat back by the kitchen or at least the dish area and were treated to the noise of falling dishes a couple times.   I liked the style of the place. The service was spot on. I like the bottle of wine. And I had a very nice coffee for desert. I was happy after my meal. After reading the reviews and hearing the hype.. Perhaps my expectations were a little high or we just caught them on an off night. 3.5 in my book but I went ahead and rounded up.",

    "text": "My birthday arrives not too long ago. So my fiancee decided to take me to this supposedly hidden gem in the dessert. I can understand why its hidden. She made a reservation for us at 9 and we still have to wait 10 minutes before we got seated, whats the reservation for then?   We ordered the grill octopus which is just that grilled octopus. Burned not enough seasoning and yah its not fair cos I come from the island that knows how cook octopus properly  and it doesnt live up to my standard. Ordered the steak and its just doesnt taste good. The server never asked me if I want any extra sauce or sides. Maybe because they think we are asian and dont want to balloon the bill so that he dont have to take a hit if we dont tip him well.   I am sorry, thats not how we roll. If you dont fuck up too much, you will still get your 20 %. Trully mediocre birthday dessert. So and so food, a one and done for me. I give a star for the decor, another star because my fiancee try ever so hard to take me to a nice 4.5 restaurant but am sorry. My standard is way higher than barrymore. No thanks.",

As in the free bread at the beginning of you meal... It's delicious.   I had the salmon and it was awesome. Perfectly cooked and they did something magical to the skin on the salmon... It was like caramelized or something. Whatever it was they are doing it right.   They changed up their usual St. Germain martini and turned it into a cucumber martini for me and it was perfect.   Our server was so nice and even gave my mom the last splash of wine when she finished her glass.",

    "text": "This place is gorgeous and the food was absolutely delicious!  It's tucked away in an off-strip time share, and was about a $20 minute cab ride from Aria.  The decor is really intimate and romantic, with big comfy booths and movie reels covering the ceiling.  Our waiter was Israel, and he was really friendly and gave us great service throughout the night.  We had a couple of drinks each, and they were okay, nothing amazing, but strong enough.  We started with the lobster mac and cheese, and this was pretty tasty.  Tons of lobster, and very cheesy, a great dish.  For our entrees, boyfriend ordered the ribeye, and I got the heritage pork chops, along with a lobster tail and cream corn lobster.  The ribeye was fantastic, cooked perfectly and juicy and flavorful.  The pork chops were great as well, a little dry, but still very very flavorful with a delicious au jus.  The lobster tail tasted fresh, and was we polished it off pretty quickly.  I must say, that my favorite part of the meal was the lobster cream corn.  Oh.  My.  God.  So delicious.  The creamed corn was perfect, and there was tons of lobster throughout the dish.  I couldn't stop eating it.    The one main issue for the night was when it came time to pay.  I got the bill, and the amount looked right, and I handed over my card.  He took my card away and ran it, and I thought all was well.  However, he came back and told me that he'd actually given me the bill for another table, and that he'd have to take my card to cover the difference.  Fine, of course.  However, instead of charging us the difference between the two bills (the wrong bill rang in about $190, which our actual bill was about $210), he \"voided\" the old transaction and charged the entire $210 to my card again.  Now, we're pretttty low rollers here, and the unexpected $200 extra expense really screwed things up.  I got an angry text from Wells Fargo almost immediately, and questioned our waiter about the transaction.  He told me that the money would most likely be refunded by the next business day (a Thursday), and didn't explain why he didn't just charge me the difference instead of creating a whole new transaction.  Over the next couple of days, the money wasn't put back into my account, but the restaurant was sure to hurry and process the 20% tip that I still provided for our waiter on my card.  Eventually, when I lost faith that they had actually voided the transaction, I called my bank and had them investigate the charges.  The issue was finally resolved the next Tuesday, almost a week after our meal, and well past the \"one business day\" that I was told it would take to void the charge.  Luckily, I had taken out all my cash for my Vegas stay, or else I would've had all my money locked up because of this issue.    When all is said and done, we had a fantastic meal at this restaurant, which warranted five stars.  However, the lack of common sense in handling the billing mishap and all the inconvenience that it caused keeps me from leaving them a five star review in good faith.  If I ever did go out of my way to come back here, I would definitely pay in cash.",

    "text": "On my most recent visit here, I was pleased to enjoy one of the top 5 steaks I've ever had. On previous trips I've had the ribeye, and my fiance has had the filet mignon (which I always, happily, get to finish). On this particular trip I tried the New York Strip, and I am glad I did. Not a super easy steak to cook, and if you do it wrong you can definitely end up with a piece of meat that's wrong in a lot of ways.   The Barrymore has nailed it. They know steaks. Best-kept secret in Las Vegas meat.  And as I keep harping on in all my reviews, the steaks are GRASS-FED! Not only is this amazingly healthy compared to grain- or corn-fed steak, but the flavor is worlds apart. Grass-fed steaks are better in every conceivable way. (Except maybe price, but you get what you pay for!)",

    "text": "Well I must say that I am quite impressed and baffled that I have never heard of this place.  Thanks to Ms. Yelp herself (Misti Y.) her recommendation exceeded expectation.  The Barrymore is a hidden treasure located in the little boutique-like hotel off of Convention Center Drive (across the street from Ross).  Who knew???  Anyways, I was so excited to try something different...and to suprise my honey for Valentines Day.  We got seated immediately as our reservation was for 6:30 on Friday night.  There was only a couple other tables with people at the time we were seated but come 7pm the place was full.  We ordered our drinks Chardonney and the Barrymore (signature drink) which both were great!  A little pricey but good.  My glass of wine was $13.  A selection of breads came out...warm and delish.  The Italian bread crusted with salt was my favorite.  For appetizer we had the shrimp cocktail (on steriods).  They were gigantic!  We both ordered the filets and OMG Im so glad we did.  It was melt in your mouth goodness.  The sides we picked (which are ordered separately) were mashed potatoes (the creamiest I think I have ever had) and the brocollini which was a nice addition too.  And did I mention the decor and the ambiance???  This was a Del Friscos meets old Vegas feel.  A little on the dark side which the waiter had a flashlight to help with the menu.  There was an outdoor patio with lounge seating and a fire in the background.  We went out there just to take some pics and the waiter ran out to help with taking some photos.  So nice.  A little goes a long way!  Overall I am pleased!  Well recommended Misti!  It is a little pricey.  Our bill was about $200.  So if money is not an object and your looking for good food and romantic ambiance by all means try this place.  Its also a nice place to just check out for drinks....sit on the patio!",

I've tried the Filet, Jidori Chicken and the Short Rib - all were excellent.  For apps, I recommend the rock shrimp, artichoke, beet salad and heirloom salad. My friends ordered the Sea Bass and the Scallops - both were pleased with their order.   The patio is especially nice when the weather is good.  The restaurant also boasts a nice cocktail and wine selection. I like \"The Barrymore,\" which is pretty similar to an Old Fashioned.",

    "text": "A fellow foodie was raving about the Barrymore, they mentioned the prices, service and food quality and I was intrigued.  The restaurant is small so I would imagine that reservations are a good idea.  The atmosphere is upscale and cozy.  The restaurant is a  bit dark and in order to read the menu I did have to make use of the flashlight app on my cell phone.  For starters we had roasted heirloom beet salad and an order of pan seared  foie grais .  The salad was great if you like beets (and I do).  Nice portion and because of the pistachios   and goat cheese it was a nice mix wonderful flavors and textures.  The very generous portion of foie grais was rich and flavorful and served with toasted pecans and a sweet potato pastry.  Dinner entrees where duck confit and lobster thermidor with a side of creamed corn w/lobster. The duck confit was the best I have ever had. Rich and flavorful served atop creamy farrow.  I have no idea what creamy farrow is, but it was yummy and a complimented the duck very nicely.  The lobster thermidor was the least favorite dish.  It was more of a lobster  stew served in a lobster shell.  It wasn't bad, just not what we were expecting. We have had lobster thermidor in a variety of places and this was very different. Again not bad just different.  The lobster was allegedly 2.5 pounds. I don't think so but the portion was filling and the flavors rich.  We finished up with vanilla bean cheesecake and creme brulee. Both were good, but neither stood out and I wished I hadn't spent the calories or the carbs.  Overall this place is a winner.  Great food, great service, perfectly lovely atmosphere and great pricing. The food quality, portions and presentation are top notch and we have added this establishment to our list of favs.",

    "text": "My girlfriend took me here for my birthday dinner and it was phenomenal. Out of a whole vacation of awesome food, the grilled octopus we had here might have been the best thing I ate the whole trip. The lobster Mac and Cheese was great too as were the cocktails and wine selection.   We were extremely well taken care of by our server. He brought out champagne and desert when he found out it was my birthday and was very friendly and attentive without hovering. He said the chef refused to tell anyone how they got the octopus so tender, though, so don't bother asking. This is a perfect restaurant for a romantic dinner.   The only weird thing is the 2 star hotel it's in. It's the kind of place that people would stay at on road trips before smartphones and the only way you'd know of a hotel is if you could see it from the freeway. When we were pulling up, I was thinking \"where the hell are you taking me?\"  There were more NASCAR jackets in the hotel lobby  than full sets of teeth, but once you get into the restaurant, its hard not to get pulled into its Old Hollywood style vibe. It's just cool. That's the perfect word for it.   Like I said, the food was great and the service was awesome. I expect this is more of a \"local's only hidden gem\" than a tourist spot, but you'd be well served giving this place a shot.",

    "text": "I found the Barrymore after looking for the perfect spot to eat lunch upon our arrival to Vegas right here on Yelp.  Though, not sure why it says dressy, it's definitely a more business casual/trendy vibe.   WHAT a find! Definitely off the beaten path, but a cheap cab ride (from city center) to a pretty great meal, vintage decor and a terrific bunch of people. A touch of class and personality in Vegas.   Don't be surprised if people can't find it and make jokes about Drew Barrymore when you ask where it is. As soon as you turn right onto Convention Center Drive, it'll be on your right hand side almost immediately.   For lunch, we started with the lobster mac and cheese. Now, I'm lactose intolerant -- but I will have you know, if I didn't have anywhere else to go that day, I would've eaten it all! YUM.  I opted for the lobster roll and my friend chose the burger. Both were the perfect serving size and tasty. We also enjoyed the signature Barrymore drink which was concocted from Gentleman Jack (which I usually dislike) orange marmalade believe it or not and some other ingredients. Don't judge! It was lunch in Vegas -- cocktails are acceptable this early ;)  After speaking with the manager, it turns out they do dinner up pretty big as well. Jerome (I think) runs a tight ship and really pays attention to cleanliness.      While sitting at the bar after lunch to finish my cocktail, I met Monica who was really chill, friendly and helpful. Behind the bar is a custom made TV within a vintage looking gold frame. When the tv isn't on -- it's a mirror.  There's a couple of these inside. I totally want one for inside the house. I couldn't decide what I wanted to drink next (since now we were in full swing of conversation and my previous glass was empty) when I asked if she had a few particular items to make my self-created cocktail, the Hendy.  She executed perfectly and the manager agreed it was the epitome of the perfect summer drink.  I truly hope to see it on the menu then  :)  We also met Billy, the owner, who also owns Holsteins in the Cosmo.  (where we ended up for lunch the following day). Turns out the bottomless bloody Mary I was eying, the Hillbilly, which uses beef brisket infused vodka, is named after him. Can't say I tried it -- but had I been there for brunch, I certainly would.   Overall -- this new spot is definitely one I'll continue to visit when I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Stick a flag in the Barrymore, everyone.  Put it on permanent bookmark because this is the best restaurant in Las Vegas.  Part classical steakhouse/part French bistro with a mixologist-designed drink menu and a classic Vegas/contemporary hipster feel.  It's cool.  It's tasty.  It's just plain great.  When tourists hit Vegas, they often try out the stylish restaurants on the Strip, hoping for unique flavors and a meal they will talk about long after they've flown home.  Vegas locals know, though, that the best chance at that kind of meal is often hidden off the Strip on other Vegas streets.  My vote for the most memorable meal in Vegas is the Barrymore.  While the will tourists hit French restaurants and steakhouses on the strip for $100+ a person meals, the Barrymore is quietly the best classically upscale restaurant in Vegas at more moderate price (although still not cheap).  Appetizers: classic options with interesting taste twists.   The panzanella (Tuscan tomato salad): tart and sweet and delicious with vinegary marinated heirloom tomatoes topped with burrata cheese (that appears to be homemade) and fried bread pieces (not dried out croutons--lightly fried bread pieces).  Put it all together and it's brilliant. Roasted Heirloom Beets: roasted beets and goat cheese should be officially married after tasting this dish.  They are perfectly paired.   The Dinner: steakhouse options and various rich dinner options. Duck confit: served with risotto, this dish should be award-winning--rich and flavorful and tender. The risotto is all flavor and buttery with truffle flavor on top.  The amount of duck served is small, but the flavor is so rich that you won't mind the choice of quality over quantity as the duck meat falls off the bone. Scallops with curried cauliflower: another perfect pairing.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and topped with a delicious and tart cilantro sauce. Asparagus side: grilled expertly--still crisp, but roasted long enough to bring the flavor to the surface.  The bar is worth a visit on its own.  The martini menu is a page long and has some delicious blends.  Fans of mixology will love this place.  And back to the food.  Save room for the tiramisu when you come here.  It is a unique take on the classic dessert--with the marscapone filling a cup with lady fingers and a coffee-flavored biscotti.",

    "text": "The restaurant was magnificently decorated. It combined Damascus design with cinematic kitsch, finishing with elegant French trimming, resulting in two dining rooms that made me museum-anxious about bumping things. There was a talented lounge singer crooning hits that ranged from Amy Winehouse to Gershwin standards by the bar, and her dulcet tones were piped into both dining rooms.  The food was really incredible. Between the two of us, we tried 75% of the menu and there was nothing that didn't just break my heart with its perfection of flavor. However, the champagne used in the Bellini I ordered was really sharp and brutal, tasting like fruity rubbing alcohol rather than champagne brimming with mellow peach.  The room we dined in had serious mood lighting going on, leaving us to hold hands during dinner so as not to lose one another in the dark. Not a bad thing, all the more romantic, right? Besides, once Barrymore staff drew back the grey diaphanous curtains, there was a spectacular view of the Riviera's rainbow of neon.  The only question in my mind was why the Barrymore made it so hard to get a table when the restaurant was half empty? We called for a reservation in the evening, and they turned us away. 15 minutes later I noticed a \"book a table here\" icon on Yelp and it said they had a table for multiple times available, so I used that to get a table. When we got there, they told us they'd had a lot of cancellations that evening. Why not just let us have a table in the first place. We were virtually their only customers when we arrived.",

    "text": "Don't let the hotel that it's in, fool you! The hotel (I don't even remember the name) looks like a book-by-the-hour hotel and I was afraid I was in the wrong spot. However, once you step into the Barrymore, you are transformed into a swanky, 1960's Mad Menish, restaurant. They really should move to a hotel that fits its class and style.  I made reservations for 7:30 PM in order to give my friends and I ample time for a nearby 9:30 show. However, we weren't seated until 8:10. The hostess profusely apologized and the manager even came to our table and offered us a free appetizer. We all looked at the menu for 10 seconds, not sure what appetizer to get, but he said \"Don't worry. I'll take care of you.\" 10 minutes later, THREE appetizers came out and they were all delicious. We got the roasted artichoke, roasted heirloom beets, and the lobster mac and cheese (MUST HAVE if you like mac and cheese). Maybe I should come here more often and pray that there is a delay just to get free appetizers.   As for our entrees, all three of my friends had great dishes (sorry forgot what they ordered) but my Diver Scallop entree tasted as if the chef accidentally dropped a bottle of salt into my dish. I made my friends try it, just to make sure I wasn't being overly critical, and one of my friends actually spit it out because it was too salty. I wanted to return the dish, but we were already running late and I didn't want to cause more trouble! I'm not sure if that's how the dish is supposed to taste, but if it is, it's waay too salty for me and my friends.   Overall, the manager is great, the atmosphere is sexy and posh, and the food is generally tasty.",

I've been to many upscale restaurants opened by celebrity chefs, but this honestly blows many of them away. Located inside the Royal Resort behind Encore, you'd never expect to find such a fabulous restaurant here. The interior is Mad Men-esque with chic retro decor and a really swanky ambiance.  Food and cocktails were phenomenal and the service was unpretentious and top notch. Everyone was super friendly and we even had the pleasure of meeting their amazing chef de cuisine Francisco Campa.  The seared foie gras was to die for! My friend and I shared one order, but considered ordering another because it was just that delicious. We also enjoyed their decadent lobster mac n cheese, and the fish and duck specials of the night were amazing. Be sure to ask for recommendations and hear about their specials. For cocktails, I really loved the Virginia Hill (Pisco, Lillet Blanc, peach syrup, fresh lemon juice, egg whites,  peach bitters, sage). You really can't go wrong with anything though. Book a table here and thank me later!",

Thats a great plus to me to change it up and draw people back.    Farm Egg & Crispy Rice Cake (harissa aioli, chorizo & herbs) was our starter.  I was amazed that it was crispy rice.  It looked like a crab cake with an egg on top.  Yum!  I enjoyed the caesar salad the dressing was light and not tart? like some places.   The steak frites was my entree and the fries were skinny and cripsy.  Just the way I like them.  Steak was juicy laying over a bed of sauteed onions spread over bread.    I forgot which burger the hunny got, but he said it was nice and juicy as well.    We were there for lunch, surely we need to drop by for dinner.  Don't forget to check the pictures.  The decor makes Barrymore so unique.  I felt like were were eating at them little restaurants in L.A especially when seating outdoors.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying my wife and I were pleasantly surprised by just about everything at The Barrymore and not because we had no expectations.  Having lived in Las Vegas for nearly ten years, we were familiar with the location of the Royal Resort and had to wonder just how good it could be considering that.  Upon entry our fears of a downscale experience were immediately removed...the hotel lobby was beautifully decorated and spacious.  The Barrymore restaurant itself was gorgeously furnished and appointed.  The space consists of two dining rooms, a bar and a very nice patio area.  The front dining room is light and bright and the rear dining room was darker and had a romantic vibe with big booths.  The menu was fairly small but still had a great selection with good variety.  We started with a very unique and delicious grilled artichoke.  Then I had a perfectly prepared non-salty French onion soup while my wife enjoyed an interesting salad with hearts of palm, lettuce and tomato with bleu cheese...I forget the exact name of the salad, but I had a bite and it was delish.  We then both enjoyed filet mignon steaks with asparagus and creamed spinach sides.  The steaks also included some peeled tomatoes and a unusual onion preparation.  To make a long story short, all of the food was simply fabulous.  Perfectly prepared with care and very lightly seasoned.  The service was absolutely first rate, with quick drink replacements, flat and silverware replaced between each course.  Both our actual waitress and the bus person were paying very good attention to us for the duration of our 1.5hr meal.  In summary, it will be our pleasure to travel from Henderson to enjoy another meal at The Barrymore in the future.  The only other things I'd note are that they had excellent air conditioning and that was much appreciated on this 109F day and that they no longer offer deviled eggs.",

    "text": "I don't get all the hype and rave reviews from yelpers. Yes, the ambience is nice and the restaurant sports on some creative decor (there are movie reels in the ceilings!), but the food is just blah and the service is horrible.   As a disclaimer, I came here during brunch so you may get better mileage during dinner. We had three types of appetizers that were just flat-out unmemorable: The grilled artichokes, the soft-shell crab and the deviled eggs. The grilled artichokes weren't so bad, but the soft-shell crabs and deviled eggs lacked that \"umph\". The soft-shell crab needed more acidity to cut it's richness (no - the mandarin oranges simply did not cut it) and the caviar in the deviled egg were muddled.   For my main, I had the lobster benedict, which was god awful. The dish,  a layer of soggy toast, asparagus, and lobster served with potato hash, was drizzled in a hollandais sauce that was  too tangy for my taste.   The desserts could have also been better. I had the coconut panacota, and I've had many variants of this dish. I've always been fond of desserts with coconut cream as a base, and choosing these type of desserts have never failed me until now! The panacota was paired with fried granola-like coconut flakes that were just to sweet and overpowered the subtle coconut taste. To the chef at Barrymore, try adding hints of lemograss (ala Spring Chicago) and serving it with blood orange (ala NaHa) to bring out the subtle coconut-cream flavor.  One star for the food and inattentive server, plus another star for the clever interior design.",

    "text": "I think I found my new favorite restaurant! Or at least in Vegas...  Upon entering The Barrymore you can immediately tell you are going to be dining somewhere special. The \"old Hollywood\" theme was trendy, yet very inviting and comfortable. Definitely not what I would expect for an \"off-the-strip\" restaurant.   We arrived about 30 mins before our reservation and were directed to enjoy some cocktails at the bar until our table was ready. We decided to go outside to the patio, which was decorated with plush couches and lined with a fire pit. The host (possibly manger) was very attentive to our needs and we were relaxing with drinks in no time. Within a few minutes we were invited to be seated at our booth.   They say you can tell a great restaurant from the bread, and the cherry bacon rolls were all the indication we needed. To start, our table of four decided to split the lobster mac & cheese, roasted artichoke and calamari. To our delight, the appetizers were much larger than anticipated. If you pick just one app to start, you have to go for the lobster mac. It was the best part of the meal! The noodles were perfect for holding the creamy marscarpone cheese sauce, which tasted like it had hints of truffle oil mixed in with the lobster chunks. Pure heaven. For an entree I got the sea bass with brussel sprouts, which had a perfect sear. My table also enjoyed the ahi tuna (with delicious polenta) and filet.   We were completely stuffed after the meal but managed to make room for dessert since it was a double birthday dinner. We ordered the chocolate cake and ricotta cheesecake and the waitress served them with candles. Both were absolutely delicious and delicately portioned to not put us over the edge.   I would highly recommend this restaurant. The service was spot on, prices were reasonable and food was delicious. I can't wait to come back the next time I'm in town!",

Service: 5 stars on this one. staff here is extremely nice, very courteous, and extremely attentive. we had a party of 8 and they were on the ball throughout the meal. Well done!  3.

We all agreed the cowboy was the best steak any of us had every tasted, worth every penny!  Do not pass up the roasted artichoke app!  I don't know how they cook it but it was the most fantastic thing I had ever tasted!  Some of our party spent $20 each and some spent $100, great price range!  Also, the less expensive options were still presented and cooked with the same care as the most expensive!  We wish we lived in LV so we could eat here every night!  I can't say enough great things about The Barrymore!  Try it and you will not be sorry!  Only disappointing part of the night is that they are no longer serving the Smore's!!!  It looked so good online : (",

The reviews appear to be promising but unfortunately the service and quality of the food was not the best.   The restaurant is within a small hotel that does need some renovation. Lobby is quiet and after leaving the cosmopolitan my first impression was that it was dead. Any other place in the USA I probably wouldn't have noticed.   The actual decor is nice and in good taste. The place is tiny so I do recommend making reservations. The hostess did offer outside or inside seating. I recommend inside since the outside is a simply patio and the decor of the inside is nicer.   Wait staff. Although they were nice an accommodating, it did take awhile (15 min) to get our drinks and some bread. Speaking of bread, I would have appreciated a heads up that the bread has bacon in it. I do my best not to each pork/beef etc so that wasn't cool.   The waiter really pushed hard for  the special after I came thinking the scallops might be a good choice. Not sure if that was because of the quality or what but he made it clear not to order the scallops.   The food was just 'ok\".  The Octopus, slight over cooked. They also gave me a huge piece that needed to be cut, not knife so left that on the plate.   Foie Gras - not cooked enough, cold. Made the fat taste like fat. Foie Gras can be delicious and this time it tasted like fat.   The special and halibut were tasty but not worth ever coming back.   The only good thing was the Barrymore drink. That was good.   Overall not really impressed. To bad, i would have like to have had a great meal.",

We were very concerned with getting to this restaurant, as some people said you need to drive and we didn't know how far off the strip it was, but we took the deuce to convention center drive and it was a VERY short walk to this place, so no fear there. We came here in the middle of the afternoon and were the only people in the dining area (there were a few people at the bar). The place is super kitschy, with movie reels all over the ceiling and a real funky hipster feel. We started with the matzo ball soup. The veggies were still a bit crisp and tasted very fresh. The matzo balls were a good, firm consistency. The BF got the steakhouse burger. This was one of the best burgers he or I had ever had. Oh mah gawd. It is served on a giant english muffin with bacon jam....He ordered it medium well and it was juicy and amazing. The flavor of this thing was RIDIC! I want one right now and like everyday for the rest of forever. I got the steak frites. Also, incredibly delicious. Kind of different, the steak is served piled high on a piece of toast with some aioli or something and some caramelized onions, parm (?) and arugula. Fries on the side. So tasty. I wanted to lick the plate. We finished with a molten chocolate cake and it was sick. So good. All of this for 50$ and we had a groupon for....50$! It could not be any better. For Reals.   This is a must try in Vegas, I only wish there was one in Phoenix.",

This is a great place hidden in an unassuming hotel. It's a nice break from the strip without being too far. A hidden gem, if you will. We'd definitely be back!",

    "text": "Ok, so this restaurant is the epitome of \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\".  My husband took me here for dinner on our first night in Las Vegas.  At first I thought  we were lost or the restaurant had moved.  The Barrymore is located inside the Royal Resort which is a little off the main strip.  Upon walking into the hotel there was no one in sight other than one person behind the service desk that pointed us towards the direction of the restaurant.  Once we walked through the somewhat hidden door it was like we were taken back to a the 1940's when mobsters ruled Vegas.  Our server Luis was great and provided us with good recommendations.  We started off with Lobster mac & cheese.  They were are very generous with the lobster meat. My husband ordered the Bone-in Ribeye while I had their Chilean Sea bass and we ordered the Cream Corn Lobster and Roasted Cauliflower as our sides.  Ok, so I cannot stop raving about the amazing Chilean Sea bass.  It was melt-in-your-mouth spectacular and the simplicity of how it was prepared just let the flavor of the fish shine through.  I am a Cream Corn junkie and their Cream Corn Lobster did not disappoint at all.  We both polished off every dish we ordered.  For dessert we ordered their Guava Cheesecake which was the best ending to an unforgettable meal.  Then to end the night Luis brought us four of the cutest mini macaroons.    I would definitely dine at The Barrymore again when we are in Vegas.",

Very cool, old school vibe.  Service was super friendly!  Loved our server.  She was a sweetheart and full of great suggestions.  Everything she suggested was delicious!  I had the 8oz filet mignon which was delish.  My sister had the sea bass and even though I'm not huge fish person, I tasted it and was in heaven.  The sides were perfect, especially the lobster mac and cheese!!  Dessert was excellent too!  Only complaint would be the not so friendly sommelier.  He could use a couple of customer service seminars or classes that teach the importance of a friendly smile.  Other than that, a great over all experience!  Will definitely be back!",

Took my sister to get froie for the first time since its banned in Cali. It was very plain and dissapointing.  LOBSTER MAC N CHEESE $16 Truffle, mascarpone-tallegio cream sauce. Standard lobster mac n cheese if you ask me  **CHILLED MAINE LOBSTER $18 hericot vert, potato, asparagus, & tomato with truffle vinaigrette.  very refreshing salad.

The decor is stunning with so many great touches from the cool ceiling, art in every corner & it's a very intimate space that feels very secluded.   The servers were fantastic and also very charming. The free yelp check-in glass of wine was perfection, started the evening off just right. The Caesar salad was bold, the lobster mac & cheese wasn't memorable, I would skip that dish. We shared a New York steak that was fantastic, mine oscar style which I regretted. The lobster was extra fishy & I could have skipped it. My meat didn't need any of it because it was great on its own. The mashed potatoes were phenomenal, silky & ultra buttery! The complimentary bread basket was also really great with a variety of warm choices with decadent butter.  Overall we had a really great evening and you know it's great when you're talking about coming back when you're still there!   If you want something off the beaten path in Vegas this is a great option! Perfect for date night whether you're with your main squeeze or your mistress!   I couldn't help but notice all the escort dates here, wow! Dinner & a show is always fun! We had bets going all night long!",

Although we weren't supposed to have modifications made to the menu, he made exceptions for us which was appreciated. The food was good but nothing exceptional. Basic Cesar salad, the roasted chicken looked almost identical to the entree I had the night before and I skipped out on the dessert, a pistachio creme brulee, but others said it was tasty.

It's not the Wynn or Encore but a hotel I've never seen or heard of. What is this place?  We walked into the restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised. It was classier and more intimate than I had anticipated.  Whew! The decor was very old Vegas. We got a booth...it was nice, plush and comfy. The service was great and our server was very attentive.  We started the evening with white sangria and a Honey Badger (muddled strawberries, club soda, lemon, honey Bourbon). I really enjoyed the Honey Badger. We got a complimentary veggie plate and bread. For our appetizer, we got the Pan-seared Foie Gras which is on top of peach cobbler with pecans and creme anglaise. The sweet yet tangy peach cobbler cuts down the richness of the foie gras - a nice contrast of flavor and texture. I got a medium rare filet mignon, my friend got a medium rare ribeye. To accompany our steaks, we got the Lobster Mac n Cheese, Cream Corn with Lobster. The steaks were simple and cooked to perfection. They know how medium rare is supposed to be. Pink, juicy and tender. The Lobster Mac and cheese and the cream corn with lobster were ok but definitely lacked lobster. You can count the small bits of lobster.  We were so full to even order dessert. But since it was my birthday, they gave me free dessert anyway. One was a lemon olive oil sorbet and the other was apricot sorbet. Fresh tasting and refreshing but we just couldn't finish them. We had to get a double shot of espresso to keep us awake. Then a plate of macarons came: raspberry and pistachio. They were good and had perfect shell and feet. It was a great evening!",

The meat was extraordinary and melt in your mouth delicious. The brussels sprouts with bacon were beyond with giant chunks of flavorful meat. Potatoes with truffles and Parmesan so creamy and melt in your mouth goodness!  Martinis above par. Everything in this place was the best. We've been to many a steakhouse this may be above all of them. Not to mention the intimate environment and personal touch they put on it. You must go to this place so it thrives! Would come back to town just for this!!!",

    "text": "First off, love the staff at the Royal Resort. Valet made a great first impression. You walk into the Royal-it's swanky. The Barrymore is decorated very elegantly. This isn't a place you wear Converse to.  ***HINT*** Always look at what the hostess of any restaurant you go to is wearing...this will help you with knowing if your attire is appropriate. If she's dressed up, you should be too.  In fact if there is a hostess, that means you shouldn't be wearing sweatpants!  Anyway, the hostess was wearing heels! How does she do that??? The wait staff was excellent! A manager came over to ask how our experience was.   I got a drink called a cherry picker. DELISH! I'll have five.  The bread...AMAZEBALLS. This is a classy joint so the word AMAZEBALLS might be frowned upon to describe bread but...oh well. I am going to tell you the pretzel rolls are the best in the basket, next are the large triangle Parmesan crunchy bread things. Lastly we had some other not so terrific dinner roll of some kind.  It was artful and attractive but not as appetizing as its looks would have you believe.  I got the Alaskan Halibut, my friends ordered the chicken and the steak. We were all very pleased!  However, the place is a bit pricey for the portion. My halibut was a wallet busting $27.00.  It only came with vegetables. This price does not include a salad or any more interesting hearty sides.  I feel this plate was overpriced by a good $8-10. But I pay for the swanky this isn't Macaroni Grill!  Dessert.  If you have read my other reviews which are all useful, funny and cool btw..you know me. We are BFF'S and you know me no likey the chocolate...but guess what I did...I ordered the chocolate cake.  And it came with milk chocolate sorbet and I want more. It was so good. Hazelnut sauce was drizzled all over it. My friends ordered the chocolate cake too and the amaretto cheesecake. (As a cheesecake fan I thought it was edible but not spectacular).  There was not a single crumb left (save for the crumbs in front of me that the server CONSPICUOUSLY came by to wipe away between courses. Yes, I am a messy eater, you can't take me anywhere nice!) on our plates. We all ate everything (the portions are small, but at least you aren't wasting food and not going to where you are going overly full with a food baby.  My only complaint is, the online menu didn't entirely match what was on the actual menu, it needs to be updated to match the seasonal menu because I kind of wanted the chocolate pear torte which wasn't offered. (I swear I don't care that much for chocolate!!!) or the croissant bread pudding.",

All of the guests were out of town, and we came to Las Vegas especially for this celebration. My cousin's wife made a reservation in advanced, and she was told that she can bring her own drinks and pay a corky change of $30. When we arrived to the party were told by the manager that they don't have a hard liquor license, but if we paid him $100 under the table he will allow opening our own bottle. In his own words \"When money talk law does not matter\". By the way they serve cocktails with martini. We asked him how it possible if they don't have a license $100 makes it an \"OK\".  Manager told us \"the F*** out from his restaurant\". We saw him drink vodka directly from the bottle while he was on a duty.  I believe to all the reviews that say that food is an exceptional in this restaurant, but we did not have a chance to try it. The restaurant's manager ruined my cousin's birthday, and I cannot even express our disappointment and don't understand how any respectable establishment can tolerate member of staff with this kind of manners.",

    "text": "Wife and I came for dinner on Saturday night.  After spending more than we wanted earlier we decided to scale down the level of the restaurant we would go to.  Browsing on yelp led us to Barrymore as a top 3 candidate.  Since this place stops sitting at 10:30 it sealed the deal for us since we running late.  When we arrive at the hotel we start to get worried, its definitely not in the best looking hotel from the outside and parking is in a poorly lit open lot.  However once inside the lobby was nice and into the restaurant we were pleasantly relieved that it looked very nice.  The lighting and layout was nice and cozy.  And the C shaped booths made for a very intimate dinner.  However right outside the window a pool party was going on where we could hear the music also the restaurant had no restrooms , you had to go to hotel restrooms which were clean but not the nicest you'd see in vegas. On to the food... bread was great.  Wife's fav was the cracker bread with cheese baked on it.  Mine was the multi-grain bread that had all these different flavors shooting at you... sweet savory salty.  Turns out theres bacon bits and cherries in it!   For the main course we had the bone in rib eye and whole lobster and split the two to share.  The rib eye was excellent!  The most beautiful steak I seen, perfectly chared and juicy and the best steak I have eaten, better than Mastros.  I think they cook it over an open fire.  Steaksauce definitely not needed but their house made Barrymore sauce is delicious with it too.  (their take on traditional steak sauce with more sweet than tang).  The Lobster was excellent too but it was a huge annoyance to have to shell the claws (hardest  lobster shell ever... took forever to extract the meat).  Kinda ruined the mood having to get down and dirty using elbow grease to mash open the lobster with juice squirting out.  The fries were good too.  Shoestring fries are not our favorite but they made these ones perfectly. All in all we loved our time here, I can attest that this place is every bit as good as more expensive Vegas spots.",

The young lady who answered the phone was very accommodating and set us up for dinner at 6:30 p.m.. Arrived early to have a pre-dinner cocktail and was met by a very friendly accommodating staff/bartender. From the bar it was on to the dining room which I found to have the ambiance/tone of cool \"old\" Las Vegas establishments of years past. Service attentive and not too pushy. Appetizers fabulous, foie gras, and tartare. The wine list good and reasonably priced. I was also impressed with the by the \"glass\" selection and it's  pricing, reasonable. On to the main fare. We were a party of three ladies and decided to share the bone in rib eye for \"two\". Our server was very accommodating with our \"share\" request. Once the main course arrived and tasting was done, I would say that the rib eye was one of the best steaks I have had in some time. The steak was huge with leftovers to take home after getting our fill at the table. Dessert of chocolate molten cake and we were set. All in all a great evening with an uber cool \"old\" Vegas feel. One note to management, your dining room music selection/ variety was some of the best I have heard in a restaurant. One comment being that the sound system seemed a little lacking the night we were there. One doesn't want dinner conversation overpowered by music, but thought I should give this observation a mention. Thank you The Barrymore, we will definitely be back. Cheers!",

It's comfortable and classy at the same time.  The waitstaff has you in the palm of their hand from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave - describing dishes, providing extensive knowledge about the food and its preparation, liberally giving you their recommendations if you are waffling (which I do), getting you set up with the correct before-dinner drinks, etc.  They are incredibly friendly and not stuffy at all and you really feel like you are just getting the most amazing service from someone who is thrilled to be there and there with you.  The sommalier (who I believe is also the manager?  I could be wrong?) is THE BEST!  We told him what we wanted in a wine and what our tastes were leaning towards as of late as well as our price-point, and he outlined several choices, describing each wine in sommalier terms that were technical as well as knowledgeable...  From that, he gave us his final recommendation, which we went with, and of course it was PERFECT...The thing about The Barrymore is that the food backs it all up!  Great service and just amazing food.  We had the lobster macaroni and cheese for an appetizer (sweet lord good) and swooned over the bread selection, especially the one with the bacon and fruit (cranberries? maybe cherries?) baked in....  We then went onto   My husband had the ribeye and I had the quail and we shared a side of the risotto special that day on the waiter's recommendation, and he was dead on.  It was all just out of this world.  Two regrets - we ate at Sage in the Aria the next night and it was a big fat expensive disappointment after The Barrymore... also we were too full to try desert....  something I will regret for  a long time:)",

The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The food was absolutely on par with everything else and I would go out of my way to return there to eat even if I stayed somewhere else on the strip.  We had the Barrymore Burger for lunch which was as asked medium well and my partner had his medium and both were cooked as requested.  They use a fresh over-sized English muffin for the bun which I could easily see myself eating by itself, but it was also a great compliment to the burger!  The presentation was very nice, the herbed fries came in a mini fry basket, adorable.  We also had breakfast and had the Pork Belly Benedict and the Two Egg Breakfast.  I can not fully put into words at how fantastic the Pork Belly Benedict was.  The eggs were perfectly poached, the sauce light,  the hash browns seasoned with the perfect amount of caramelized onions.  The bacon marmalade, OMG the bacon marmalade!  Yes the pork belly was good too, but I could have probably been served that marmalade alone and still given this review. My partner had the Two Eggs which I was told was also delicious, and I did try a bit of his bacon which had just that exact crunch that I love.  I would absolutely recommend checking this place out.",

The drinks before dinner were prepared and served by friendly staff members who were unobtrusive, but attentive. The dinner, was splendid. The dining room itself was a thing of beauty, not the usual gaudy sterile Vegas, but old Vegas or old Hollywood. I have dined in many restaurants world wide, this was a beautiful meal from start to finish. The young lady who cared for us was friendly, knowledgeable, and an incredibly deft server. Emily was absolutely astounding. I rarely get to Vegas but when I go to Vegas , I will be dining at the Barrymore.",

Nice bar and live music playing (singer, not a band) and rich decor.  The food was quite good.  The starter bread basket and unique butter was a great start.  Fish was excellent.  It is a bit expensive overall, but definitely a place for a great night out or a business dinner.",

We took our waiter's suggestion and tried the octopus appetizer. I could have made a meal out of that. I think I liked it even more than the scallops, which were delicious. We also had a bottle of cab recommended by our server. They have a 50 under $50 wine list, which made the whole night fairly reasonable, considering the quality of the food and staff. Our server, Israel was attentive, funny, and very knowledgeable. The hotel was kitchy and cute. There was an ancient fellow playing piano in the lobby with a small following (including us, after dinner). My husband had to tear me away.",

My meal was very good quality, but not especially memorable, except for the really fun short-ribs dish. (I don't share other reviewers' enthusiasm for the lobster Mac & Cheese. Too salty to taste the lobster, and bread-crumby texture didn't appeal to me.) Service was very good.  I don't think it competes with some of the world-class restaurants on the strip, but good value for the money, funky atmosphere, and good service make it a fun destination if your top-tier choices are overwhelmed by, say, a conference crowd. Although it's tucked away where a visitor wouldn't find it, it's only a 5 minute walk from the Wynn/Encore.",

    "text": "This place basically ruined my wedding. Let me tell you why.  I originally called in 3 weeks ago to make reservations for my party of 14 after our wedding. I had submitted my credit card authorization, requested dessert from the pastry chef (which i had no response on, but that's another story), and had told all my guests/limo the plan for the evening. Then comes the week of my wedding, as i'm scrambling to complete last minute errands and extremely stressed out. I receive a call on Monday, for my reservation that Saturday. Whomever calls me left a message to verify my reservation. I thought this was odd to call 4 days early, but figured it had to do with our large party. I returned the call to confirm, and the associate asked me if i got her message a week ago (i checked my voicemails and incoming calls and there was nothing) saying that they had a private party actually book last week (after we had made our reservation) and that we would now be seated outside for our reservations. Mind you, when i originally scheduled this, i made them WELL aware this was my wedding, aka my party will be in dresses and the low is on average 35 degrees in Las Vegas. She reassured me there would be a heater though so it's all good.   Needless to say, i cancelled my reservation. I don't understand how The Barrymore would think it is legit to change someones reservation this way because someone else called in after me? i'm confused by this policy and extremely frustrated, as i am left to find a place to entertain my guests on my wedding night the week of my wedding.   I find this place extremely disrespectful, and i will never attempt to give them my business again, although they clearly aren't too concerned with this notion.",

The hotel is an old school vibe, a bit low end. The Barrymore is an interesting old style Vegas with a classic velvet feel. The serving staff was excellent, knowledgeable, and friendly.  We started with a dirty blue chees stuff olive martini ... somehow it was not done well. I'm not sure why, but it seemed off. We order the Duck Foie Gras and Lobster bisque to start. Both had a nice presentation, however the taste seemed lacking on both. I can't say why, but it just did not come together well.  Next we ordered the bone in rib eye steak and braised short ribs. The short ribs was a major disappointment! Again a nice presentation, but  the short ribs were dry and crusted around the outside... tuff or a little burnt might be a bit more accurate description.  The center was soft and juicy... the sauce was thick and basic! The root vegetable mirepoix was greasy and had an unpleasant flavor. The bone in rib eye steak was gritty, low on flavor, and poor on marbling. The meal was $180 for 2. It was a major disappointment. At these prices, Vegas has so much more to offer with a truly amazing experience. I recommend a pass on The Barrymore.",

We also ordered the grilled octopus appetizer which was so-so - I wasn't a fan of the mango chutney - thankfully they had a sauce on the plate that made it more interesting.  My husband ordered the braised short rib with truffled mashed potatoes.  Again, not much flavor.  For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake which was definitely not freshly made; it tasted like a grocery store cake - I didn't have more than a few bites.  We also ordered the nutella ice cream which was just so so.  All in all we probably won't be back.",

Nestled in a small hotel off the strip on Convention Center drive, Yelp said it was open at 11 so we rolled in for lunch only to be told they are open dinner hours only starting at 5/530 - can't remember. So heads up, it's a dinner establishment.   It's decoreated in old-style Vegas. The celing has what looks like old movie film reels all over it. The bar is outstanding with wine bottles everywhere.  The FOOD rocks your world.   Started with white wine and The Barrymore Cocktail. Just drink it. :)   Lobster Macaroni and Cheese and a Pesto covered Artichoke dish. Had a salad much like a caprese salad but BETTER. Scallops wrapped in bacon. Didn't finish but 1 out of 3 as I was STUFFED with our appetizers and salads....we passed on dessert. I know. Hard to believe.   Our staff was FABULOUS. The ambiance is exceptional. It's the best kept secret in Vegas. By pass the chain places you can get at home. By pass where \"everyone seems to go\" and take some time to go to the Barrymore. You will NOT be sorry! :)  We'd go again in an instant.",

Apple Cheesecake was a hit at our table but  I was intrigued by the dark chocolate tart with orange zest ice cream. I couldn't put my finger on it as to what was that powdery taste in the ice cream. Turns out it was splenda...wouldn't guess that but it made it interesting. Didn't get to try the 3rd as I was concentrating on the ice cream but it must have been good since it was all gone.   Ambiance: I'm a sucker for 1950s Hollywood Glam. Booth style seating with a few tables in the middle area. Beautiful wine display.  Cons: I missed my chance for some fois gras! Sold out for the night! Thanks for the offer next time we are out in Vegas.   Overall: A small quaint restaurant that was an excellent choice for our group of 7. You know it's a good meal when everyone leaves happy and full...and we only had maybe 1 to 2 drinks. Service was beyond awesome and made our night by serving us 3 desserts for our table to share. The best was when our waiter packed up my friend's meal and since she mentioned how much she liked the pretzel bread, he packed her up 6 more! The Barrymore is definitely old Vegas charm with some damn good food.",

    "text": "This place has such a gorgeous interior and it's definite plus that it's located inside the Royal House!  I ordered  the Steakhouse Burger ($13.50) - grass-fed beef patty, bacon marmalade, gruyere cheese, frisee,oven-roasted tomatoes, garlic aioli. I think my favorite thing about the burger was that they used English muffin bread rather than your average burger buns. It really gave it a different texture and added to the mouthwatering flavor. The dish also came with a cute basket of very crisp and perfectly seasoned fries. Along with the burger, we shared some calamari that came with romesco sauce. The romesco sauce was definitely a nice complement to the very crisp and flaky calamari. For dessert, I ordered the pear creme brulee. It was a lot larger than other creme brulee dishes I've had elsewhere, but I'm not complaining ;) It was divine.  I can't wait to come back here, especially to try some cocktails!  Tips: *Make your reservation through Open Table *Try the Chocolate Coconut hot tea!",

    "text": "Was at a convention in Vegas that has a \"dine around\" evening. I always make a special effort with my team to find a great restaurant and dinning experience on a limited ($100 per person) budget. I have people from around the globe (Romania, India, Utah, Seattle, San Jose, Boston, etc) in my group. We have vegetarians, pescatarians, carnivores, and foodies in my team, so its no easy feat.  I couldn't find a reasonable restaurant on the strip (near our convention) and the concierges as The Aria and Cosmopolitan were useless and a total fail. I gave up and finally started searching myself.   I contacted The Barrymore in Novemember and asked if they could handle a group of 20+ since the restaurant is small and if we could please order off the menu (and not get a pre fixe menu since the options are always limited for such a diverse team). They assured me they could accommodate.   I booked on November 13th for dinner on December 16th. When we showed at the restaurant there was a huge crowd inside the bar (past the very cool vault-like door).   They had apparently lost our reservation. No record of it. I searched my email on my phone and found the response from the restaurant general manager confirming my team (with advanced credit card faxed in).  The hostess was clearly upset and said she's ask about it and be right back. A few minutes later an assistant manager appeared and again wanted the confirmation. Clearly realizing it was their mea culpa the offered us the patio (on December 16th where it was in the mid to low 40s). They scrambled to make it right. We got a private patio with folding tables but made up nicely with linens. They set up two heaters and we huddled the ladies and folks from India (not used to the cold) around them. We didn't have many jackets but people shared scarves and coats with those less dress.  We sat and were skeptical. It was cold. People were disappointed. I received a text message from the general manager apologizing for the mix up and admitting it was his fault and promising to make it right. And then they did. The staff and our waiter Luis was great. They made sure we got our order in before the other huge group of 60+ sitting inside did so we wouldn't have to wait outside to long for our dinner. They suggested a great and reasonably priced wine (They have 50 for under $50 and even better when you get a couple of magnums). They food was great. My octopus salad rivaled that which I had earlier this summer in Greece. Everybody raved about the steak. Although my sea bass was heavy on the butter...it was butter so I wasn't complaining.   This was a great example of an evening that could have gone very wrong and a review that could have been very different. The make of a great business is one that can recognize a mistake, put the customer first, have a professional staff and create an exceptional and memorable evening. I'll definitely go back again next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "I agree with the other reviewers on ambiance and vibe - the piano player is 96 and has Grammys from his days playing with the rat pack - so he's a kick.  Our meal started well, service was friendly and attentive. Drinks consistent with other reviews. The manager stopped by our table and chatted for quite awhile - we learned the history of restaurant and features of menu. He seemed to honestly care about our experience - I inquired about the foie gras - he said it was good, but they were going to tweak it. It was ok - a bit gamey, sinewy, too much quince, etc. good thing they will work on it. Lobster Mac and cheese was dry and tasted like strong cheese - The mgr checked back and we gave him our feedback -  he insisted on exchanging the Mac and cheese - as it turned out the second was much better and creamy (tasted like totally different dish) although I wouldn't recommend it. We ordered the special entrees- lamb, cooked perfect - could have used a crust and lobster, good too.   BUT - the specials were grossly over priced in comparison to the rest of the menu, by at least $25/ea. The waiter doesn't tell you the price, shame on us for not asking - so be aware! I don't mind spending on great food but this was good trying to be great and I don't like surprises - like when the waiter said \"don't worry, I didn't charge you $10 for the water\" WTF - this was still or tap water! Wine menu very interesting but grossly overpriced too. We are from No. CA with access to lots of great wines - we just couldn't get excited about the offering to value proposition.  We went to experience something more authentic and to get off the strip - left feeling unfulfilled and disappointed.",

    "text": "We ate here in September of 2013 and had a great experience.  We took a group there a couple days ago and I have to tell you I won't be back.  There was hardly anyone in the restaurant so you would think we'd get good service.  We didn't.  I had a filet as I had before and while it was cooked correctly, the cut was not tender.  I had to work my way through it.  Others in my party who had steak had similar complaints.  We brought wine as we always do and offered tastes to our waiter, who accepted.  Normally that results in a break on the corkage fee.  Not here apparently.  We were charged the full $35 per bottle.  The next night we visited our favorite waiter at our favorite steakhouse in Vegas and brought 4 bottles.  Our waiter only charged us one corkage and comped us 3 desserts.  That's the way you get a bigger tip and generate loyalty.  Something The Barrymore needs to learn.  We had a party of 10 so I expected an automatic service charge but there wasn't one on the bill so we only added 15% because of the service.  Low and behold when the credit card receipt came back there was an 18% service charge written in by hand.  The folks at the table who paid cash made out because I had to make up the difference.  Again, no way to get me back.  It's took bad.  I thought we had found a regular stop but we won't be back.",

Happy hour $5 wells and cosmos. Good pours and a friendly staff. The decor is pretty cool, with some neat paintings and film roll ceiling. Nice, comfy booths.   The bread basket was awesome, but could have used a little more butter. I was a little disappointed there was no cherry bacon bread that lots if other reviewers raved about, but it was still good.   We had the octopus appetizer to share, and it was done really well. A couple thicker pieces were not as tender, but very flavorful. The citrus sauce on top was quite good, and the fava beans were excellent.   My wife had the Muscovy Duck, which she liked. It came with heirloom carrots and we got a couple sides. Brussels sprouts and asparagus.  The asparagus was fresh but otherwise unremarkable. The sprouts were covered with bacon, so there's that!    I had the bone-in ribeye with bleu cheese. I ordered it medium, as many reviewers indicated theirs were more rare than ordered. What I got was a medium-rare steak that was nearly perfect. My only issue was the portions were huge, even the duck, and we couldn't finish everything. It pained me to let that beautiful meal go unfinished. I don't suppose that's something to complain about, though.   So, with drinks, an appetizer, two sides, and two entrees, we paid around $195 with tip. We would definitely return.",

At first, it seemed like we picked a terrible night for it--the place was jam packed with a huge group all wearing t-shirts akin to those smut peddlers on the strip. Luckily, their party moved outside to the piano and we seized our opportunity to grab seats at the bar.  After a quick glance at the drink menu, I went for their namesake drink, The Barrymore. I thought it would taste like the Twin Creeks Manhattan thanks to orange marmalade being one of the ingredients. I was right. It was pretty close and I enjoyed every last drop along with every last ice cube.  I'm already a fan of The Royal House and this is just one more reason to visit.",

Flavor was ok, but the leaves were blackened.  Give it a pass.  Halibut entree was sooooo over-cooked it was almost a brick.  The filet w bordelaise was cooked perfectly but there was a metallic flavor that we couldn't identify.  Both entrees went uneaten.  Gets a second star because we got a bottle of Kistler.",

    "text": "I've lived in Vegas for 50 years so it's a pretty rare occasion when something really surprises me. I've been in and out of every casino, seen most all of the bars and restaurants and even hung out at a few of them without being overly impressed. Last night my wife and I attended a Yelp event at The Barrymore and to say I was blown away is an understatement.    The Barrymore is located in the Royal Las Vegas which quite frankly has never been known as a Vegas hotspot. In fact, The Royal has mostly been known as a place that folks stayed when they couldn't get accommodations elsewhere. A couple years ago we went to a timeshare presentation at The Royal and listened to the salespersons story about how the resort was being rehabbed. I took this tale with a grain of salt and passed on a purchase. Needless to say my opinion of this tucked away spot has changed completely after last night.     Upon entering the lobby of The Royal I was taken aback by how nice the place was. The decor had been updated since my last visit with an art gallery and a cool looking sports bar/lounge adorning the interior. As we approached The Barrymore I could see that this place was no ordinary Vegas tourist trap. When we walked in we immediately took note of how classy the place was. The designers were obviously going for an early Hollywood feel and in my humble opinion they hit it out of the park. The bar was packed on this particular night, but the service was great. There is a flat screen behind the bar playing old Hollywood movies and a large glass wall that leads to the outdoor seating area. The outdoor area is large enough for about 20-25 people to sit and plenty of space to mingle and enjoy a nice spring evening. There is also a fire wall which really set-off the exterior decor. It was definitely an ultra-cool patio.    Returning to the inside we decided to check out the restaurant area since they weren't serving guest yet. WOW! In a word, this place is plush! Huge black leather booths, old school gold movie projector reels adorning the ceiling and a glass wall which allows diners to peek into their extensive wine storage room. It is the kind of place that reminds me of old Vegas when people wore suits and gowns out for the evening as opposed to today when the weekend warriors trudge in and take over the town.    In a wonderful twist of fate for anyone reading this review there is a Groupon deal out today (3/05/12) $25 for $50 worth of menu items at The Barrymore. I would highly suggest that you buy one and go check this place out. I can't wait to go back to eat there and have a drink out on the front patio. It won't be long for The Barrymore to find its place firmly on the list of Vegas hot spots.",

The lobster mac and cheese was good, but not great due to the lobster being overcooked.  I don't think it is possible to cook it correctly, because every time I've had it anywhere, the lobster was overdone.  The drink menu was interesting and good, with many drinks you won't find elsewhere.  The wait staff was very good, with a good knowledge of both the menu and drinks.",

From the very first interaction I was hooked on this place. Heather Caldwell was incredibly kind, quick to respond, and so so friendly. Talking to her on the phone was easy and the packages they have at the Barrymore are very easily customizable to what your needs are. They have decently priced prix fixe menus with relatively low F&B minimums. We were able to feed our 34 guests a really high end meal for a great price. Everyone kept talking about how great the food and service was. We loved our meal, and our cake which was custom made in house for us. I would definitely recommend this place as a post nuptials dinner reception site. The service from start to finish was fantastic. The inside of this place is romantic and intimate and plush. It's like the Rat Pack might be hanging out in the place! Very Old Hollywood/ Old Vegas feel to it with really luxurious decor. The film reels on the ceiling is another really nice touch. Just a super romantic venue and perfect for a wedding! We didn't even need any flowers or candles (though they do have vendors available for that should you need it!)  Next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely be back for a trip to this awesome place!",

I was unimpressed initially because we made reservations for 8 pm and weren't seated until at least 8:20 pm. We had (good) drinks at the bar while we waited, but there was another gentleman sitting at the bar, who I think worked there, who was extremely obnoxious and was hitting on all of the female employees. The hostess seemed to be his girlfriend and it came off very unprofessional. After telling us our wait would be longer, she offered to sit up in the empty dining room which we declined, because we didn't come to a restaurant to sit alone with no ambiance.   Once we were seated our experience improved. The environment was romantic and intimate and our server was great. We ordered the lobster mac and cheese and it was underwhelming. I would not recommend it. Our entrees were delicious though. I had the tuna and my husband had the duck, and both meals were excellent. We also ordered the asparagus which we loved, and the cream corn with lobster which we sent back. It just was not good and seemed as if it can straight from a can. We also ordered dessert which was fantastic.  Overall, we had an enjoyable night although I don't think it is worth a second visit.",

It's stumbling distance to/from the Wynn or Slot's of Fun depending on how fancy pants you are feeling afterwards. I just can't say enough good stuff about it from the outdoor lounge to the beautiful leather interior.  It's very intimate and the steaks are just incredible. I had to be restrained from gnawing on the bone  with my bare hands by the wife.  You could pay more on the proper strip for a lesser meal with a \"named chef\" or you could go to a place like this which is definitely a unique Vegas experience. What an oasis in tourist hell. This will be a mandatory annual pilgrimage from now on.",

The wine selection was good and our waiter was friendly and helpful. Best of all, we loved the food! We had a steak, a shrimp and pasta dish (the shrimp were huge and very tasty) and the European Sea Bass which was one of the best fish dishes I've had in recent memory. The sides were really good, especially the Brussel Sprouts, and they're big, one will definitely cover 2 people. This place is a little ways off the strip but worth the drive or cab fare, highly recommended!",

The food was expensive but we thought the quality was there with the exception of the unripe tomatoes in the panzanella salad.  We thought the hotel was fine, not as shabby as we expected but definitely not reflective of such a great restaurant. We also thought the small bar was very nice and the location was around a mile from the Wynn so it's easy to get to.",

    "text": "This is in a small resort slightly off the strip it used to be a little known gem but is now quite popular in the local and tourist scene you will want to make reservations.  The whole aspect of this restaurant has been thought out, the food and the ambiance.  The hostesses, wait staff and bartenders will make this a experience to remember.  The Decor is a retro Hollywood with huge booths where you feel like you're in the middle of a mobbish Hollywood movie (think the movie Casino and old 30's 40's Hollywood), reserve a booth if you eat inside.  If you come on a time of year where the weather allows for it, eat outside on the patio they have an amazing firewall so fun to sit and watch.    A lot of prior reviewers will tell you to get the burger, it is great but there are other options I enjoyed as well.  The Lobster Deviled eggs with caviar is a fun interesting, worth the price in my opinion because it is not something I have heard of before but not amazing.  The lobster mac-n-cheese made me reminisce about childhood but remember I am an adult ;) The seared foie comes with a sweet sauce and a toast the buttery flavors of the foie with the sweet flavors of the sauce amazing.  I also recommend the roasted artichoke they have a different take on an old favorite of mine.  On to the main courses as I said earlier the burger is highly recommended but I feel there are better items to choose from, here are a couple I have had.  If you are into Lamb with potato sauce, snap peas, au jus it is extremely good very flavorful with a full blend of the sauces and the meat.  I also enjoyed the braised short rib comes with carrots onions a bacon sauce and au ju.  Braised just enough on the outside and perfection with the rest.  I have also had one of the seasonal pastas the one I had at the time was a truffle ravioli with a buttery truffle sauce but they change all the time so I cannot recommend the one I chose. For sides I enjoyed the asparagus with parmesan gratin, the creamed spinach and the creamed corn with lobster and bacon.    They have pretty much any kind of drinks both alcoholic, non-alcoholic plus specialty drinks and a amazing wine list to chose from.  The menu does change slightly with season and chefs moods so not everything besides the main menu will remain the same.",

    "text": "One of the best meals I have ever had in Vegas before!!!!!! This restaurant is not on the strip inside some fancy shmancy hotel, it's a bit off the strip pass Wynn but not far at all. We walked from our hotel (treasure island) and it took around 20-25 minutes. It is a restaurant inside of an hotel and once you walk into the hotel lobby the restaurant is to the left. Walking into the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess right away and they bought the three of us to a booth inside. It was a very simple yet elegant restaurant. They have a display of wine in glass cases and it was beautiful.   Before coming to the restaurant we did our research (ie yelped all the pictures, read some reviews and tips, and memorize the menu) so before the server ask if we had any question we already had a good idea about what we were gonna order. Of course we still asked for recommendations especially with the drinks because that's one menu we did not memorize. After ordering drinks for the table they bought over some bread and butter. The bread was so good...I don't know if we were famished from a day of clubbing but it was so good but I had to control myself so I can fit in all the other food.   For appetizer we ordered the seared foie gras to share! GET IT!!! Shoot you should get two of it! It was perfectly seared and the bread that it came with made the perfect combination. For entree my friend got the Chilean sea bass and I got the steak with my other friend and we shared the Mac and cheese as a side. ORDER THE MAC AND CHEESE! It has the perfect crunch on top of some gooey cheese giving you a crunch with each bite. My steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked just the way I like it. My friends Chilean sea bass was also amazing, very fresh and the miso glaze was just right, not too heavy or light.   Next time you're in Vegas give this place a shot, the prices are fairly cheaper compared to all those other fancy restaurant on the strips and you get an amazing meal with wonderful accommodating servers.",

    "text": "Once you enter through the heavy and elegant  white door of The Barrymore, you can tell that this will be quite the neat experience.   We were greeted by Paul, the manager of the place and his presence off the bat was friendly and endearing. He sat us down quickly and introduced us to the wine and food menus. He gave us a few moments to look through the wines- a nice assortment from different regions across the world. We were then introduced to Israel, the \"jack of all trades\" at the restaurant. After consultation with both gentlemen, we decided on a white \"Les Abeilles,\" and we couldn't be more satisfied.   We started with the Lobster Mac n Cheese, Israel letting us know it's a crowd favorite. The Marscapone and freshly made shell pasta complimented the slices of lobster quite well. The assortment of warm breads that were brought to the table were also a great plus, and the butter was room temperature- not even some swanky restaurants on the strip do that!   My partner and I were both craving sea bass, so we ordered both kinds: Chilean sea bass and European.  The European sea bass was crisp on the outside and thinly sliced, paired with a saffron ratatouille and spices. It was a great pairing.  The Chilean sea bass was seared on the top  and a smooth texture on the inside, perfectly cooked. It was placed on an English pea risotto that was so creamy and delectable, that alone I'd fly back for. After trying both dishes, superb in their own styles, I would recommend the Chilean sea bass if you only wanted to order one- you won't regret it.   We finished our meal with a dulce de leche cake and a strawberry compote and ice cream. A fresh finish to a savory meal.   Throughout our entire eating experience, I commend the staff for being engaging and accommodating to our every need. They were friendly, thoughtful, and had great conversation to give to folks while they dined at their establishment.   And to top it all off, Israel introduced us to the legendary Joe Vento, house musician who played alongside some of the greats on the Vegas strip throughout the decades. He's a regular at The Barrymore, playing routinely at the hotel piano in the lobby right outside the restaurant. If you catch him performing, or find him dining in the restaurant, make sure you have a conversation with him. Who knows, he may just play a ballad or two. :)  And so I finish with this- if you are one who frequently visits Las Vegas or it's your first time, take some time to indulge yourself in all that is the Barrymore. Don't hesitate to make the trip a little off the strip to have some great food in an intimate environment.   So what are you waiting for..?",

    "text": "A strong 4 stars!  I came here most recently because I was wanting a place with a unique feel and wonderful ambiance for dinner... and was entirely happy with the choice of The Barrymore! The atmosphere is exceptional. Old film reels line the ceiling in the main dining area and the surrounding aesthetics compliment with a feel from yesteryear.  The food is consistently 4 star quality-- with the occasional 5 star standout and the less occasional 3 star encounter. The menu changes seasonally, but I've had a lot of love for the fish entrees and as a result haven't ventured too far from those options as a main course goes. More memorable though, have been some of the starters. Their Foie Gras used to come with peach gobbler and more recently it has been Pan Seared and accented with clementine confit and citrus jus. They do a good job of pairing it with fruits that enhance the natural flavors of the foie. The octopus has a beautiful texture and taste. Lobster Mac & Cheese isn't usually my favorite, but I liked sharing it here specifically because of the truffle essence and mascarpone-tallegio cream sauce. We enjoyed the Steak Tartare with pickled shimeji mushroom and quail egg. The mushrooms were a pleasant, rightfully earthy addition, but generally speaking wasn't as memorable as some of the other options.  They also make quality drinks at The Barrymore. Their menu is dominated with white spirits and a good selection of gin, but I have had a couple real nice whiskey based drinks after talking to the bartender for a bit.  While I would come in for the food, the setting has consistently been the impetus for my return visits...I am a sucker for nice ambiance though. Still, this isn't my choice for a romantic meal, just for special/memorable experiences.",

    "text": "2 stars- terrible service and only a couple good dishes.  The Barrymore is beautiful inside, with people singing and nice lighting. I had made a reservation for my birthday. When I arrived they told me 10 minutes and as I waited with my party, the phone at the hostess desk rang un-answered constantly. This should have been a sign.  Once seated my boyfriend was unhappy about the booth, but it didn't bother me. Then it took at least 20 minutes for anyone to come over and take drinks. Another 20 for bread to arrive. Then the bottle of champagne came out that we ordered and we were told it had been chilling, we can feel the bottle if we would like, but we may want it a bit colder. I tasted it and it was room temperature.... so it had to sit for 20 minutes in ice. The sommelier however was amazing and made me a chair out of the cage on the bottle. Then after being there an hour we got to order.  We were pressured by the waiter to all get appetizers and entrees and that they didn't come with sides just garnishments so we needed that too. He seemed offended when not all of us wanted appetizers. It took 40 more minutes for the food to come. Once it did half of the party enjoyed their dinner, half did not enjoy it. The bread, octopus and Brussels sprouts were all fantastic, my salmon was good with the hollandaise. Both of the fish dinners came with sides, the steak did not. My boyfriend's steak was charred on the outside and tasted burned, but the inside was blue, not just rare, blue. He was bummed especially since he ordered it medium rare. They also brought me the wrong dinner at first, so I had to wait a bit longer for my dinner as well.  I was so excited to go to The Barrymore and bring 4 friends. I've been talking about going for the last year and now I wished I had picked somewhere else for my birthday. It took 2 1/2 hours to eat dinner and it seemed their service was pushy when there and overall unattentive. They are only looking for you to spend as much as possible and don't care about your experience. Except for the sommelier, he was lovely.",

All of our guests could not stop raving about the food. I'll skip straight to the mains - the stand-outs were Morrocan Lamb shank and Bone-in Ribeye as a menu add-on (definitely worth the extra $15pp on prixe fixe menu)! I can't remember the last time we had a nice steak out at a restaurant...man, was it good! Heard the lamb shank was fall-off the bone tender and commented in how it was the best they'd had and we're from Australia where they do lamb right (next to NZ ;).  Desserts were also a winners - Chocolate Pot de creme and Guava cheesecake.  If you are curious,  we had Crispy Rock Shrimp, Lump Crab Cake and Lobster Bisque for starters.  Service was excellent and very accomodating and attentive - thank you Sergio, Luis and staff.  Also, a huge THANK YOU to our fellow Yelpers for helping me find this gem - without you guys we wouldn't have a clue where to go!!",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try the Barrymore for quite some time, so we finally decided to give it a try this weekend. First and foremost, this place is tiny! You will definitely want to make a reservation to ensure that you get a table. The dining room is small and kind of dark. The weird wallpaper does nothing but darken the place up even more. The ceiling is really cool and I think with a lighter wallpaper it would really showcase the awesome ceiling.   Our meal started with the bread basket and we were not disappointed. The bacon raison bread was really delicious and the warm baguette slices were also a great touch. The parmesan crisps were also good, I even added a few to my pasta.   I started with the Roasted Heirloom Beets and was so happy I did. I love a good beet salad and they have a great beet salad. The goat cheese fritter was a really inventive touch. Everything on the plate worked well together and I tried to savor every bite. My husband started with the lobster mac and cheese. I really liked that it was creamy, but I didn't really think the lobster added anything to the dish.   My husband and I both chose specials for the night. I went with the pappardelle pasta with a pork belly ragu and escarole. The escarole added a nice bitter flavor and the pork ragu was very savory. The pasta was delicate and delicious. I was very happy with the dish and had enough to bring some home. My husband had a surf and turf special of a filet of bison and lobster tail. The bison was so tender and delicate, I really enjoyed the few bites I was able to steal.  No meal is complete without dessert, so we moved on to the creme brulee. The creme brulee was perfectly done and the spiced pears added such an amazing flavor, it really worked well. The oatmeal cookie ice cream didn't bring much to the dish, but it was still really yummy. I definitely want to eat all future creme brulee with spiced pears!  We were not disappointed with our meal and I would definitely head back to the Barrymore again...soon!",

    "text": "Hmm... Okay. We were super excited to go to the Barrymore because the photos on Yelp were enticing, and we felt like we were destined for an exceptional meal a bit off the beaten path. The location is very convenient to the (North) Strip but does also feel like a secret. It's in a hotel- I can't recall the name, but it appears to be one of those old-becomes-new-and-trendy situations. You walk into a big, dramatic door in the hotel lobby and the restaurant has great ambience- dark and sultry. There was live music playing in another room but we could hear it through the speakers. That's about where the experience peaked... 1) only one person per table can get the free \"check-in.\" Okay, fine. 2) the service is best described as... Aloof. Granted, one of our party is hard to please, but she was actually on her best behavior. She didn't care for her wine, and the whole process of appeasing her was handled fairly dismissively by both the server and the man who I can only guess is the manager. Every time they came to the table the vibe was almost one of annoyance. 3) everything was overcooked. Except for the lobster mac, which was tasty, but not amazing. But between our sea bass, lamb shank, and short ribs, there was just a little too much time on the heat.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't worth the money nor the taxi ride. In Vegas you come to expect competitive restaurant experiences, and the Barrymore was just lazy. Maybe it was just a bad night...",

We shared the grilled octopus appetizer which was perfectly tender. I had the filet with French fries and my husband had the Kobe flat iron with creamed corn. Both were delicious and cooked exactly how we wanted.  I'm a pastry chef, who normally avoids dessert, but I have to rave about the chocolate praline macaron dessert. It was a large size chocolate macaron with hazelnut chantilly, sugared hazelnuts, caramel sauce, and a tuile. It was sooooo good that I wished I would've gotten another.  Excellent place that we'll definitely return to next time we come to Vegas.",

    "text": "Wow! This place was great. I went here for a fancy night out and was very impressed with the atmosphere and the food. It's a very intimate, dark setting, and pretty cozy -- I think they only seat 50.  Anyway, we started off our meal with the grilled octopus appetizer, which was superb. Fresh, springy texture yet tender and soft. The seasoning was just right and even though the legs looked charred, they were also quite soft.   For the main course, I got the duck special, which had duck breast on top of this duck and bean mixture. The breast was very moist and flavorful. The bean mixture had bits of duck mixed in and was also good, though a tad salty. My boyfriend got the Shortrib 'Bourguignon' that comes with carrots, potatoes, and pearl onions. I thought it was quite yummy. The meat was so soft that it pulled apart easily with a fork and the glaze was really tasty. Despite what looked like a relatively small portion of food, the both of us were quite sated, although we always have room for dessert....  We finished off with the creme brulee -- SO GOOD! It came with a scoop of ice cream, spiced pears, and a sweet chip on top and the carmelized sugar gave such a satisfying crunch when we dug into the custard.  The only thing was the entrance looks like part of a wall that was partially ajar in the hotel lobby of the Royal Resort and it was kind of heavy, so we weren't sure it was open. If you see this, just pull really hard and be on your way! Also this place is on the North end of the Strip away from most of the action so it's good for a quiet date.",

The artichoke appetizer and the lobster mac and cheese were the most memorable.   The only downfall to our experience was the excessively slow service.

Shared the Lobster Mac n Cheese as an appetizer. We CLEANED the bowl with the bread. It was that delicious.   Shared the Porterhouse special with double baked potato with a friend. They pre cut the steak for you and you could taste the age-ing! Often times, I can't tell if it was aged or not, but Barrymore's steaks are definitely aged, and aged well.  The double baked potato was divine! They bake, then scoop, and blend the middle and put back into the shell with cheese on top. It was fluffy, smooth, whipped goodness.   Also checked in to get the free sparkling - which I ended up order the bottle. They even got us to go cups to take the rest with us!  Again, service was great. Ambiance was great.

This one is near the convention center, just south of the Wynn, in an unassuming hotel. Our server, Ashley, was so attentive, thoughtful, and knowledgeable. We could listen to her describe the menu items all day! There was also live music and the singer was very talented. Drinks are prohibition-style, but they can make anything you like. We had filet mignon and a wagyu steak. Both were cooked perfectly medium rare. It's a small restauarant, so we do recommend this for an intimate, romantic meal rather than a family dinner.

Mushrooms were good, bacon was good, lobster mac and cheese tasted off, shrimp scampi was tasty but one of three shrimp had not been cleaned properly. Realistically speaking if I'm paying 30 dollars for 3 shrimp and noodles, please make sure the shrimp is at least clean. After dinner we waited an exact hour before we saw our server again who offered us dessert. At that point we were ready to leave but he insisted that we get dessert because we were celebrating a birthday. \"Please, it's on me!\" We obliged and ordered the dark chocolate ice cream. It was grainy and tasteless. He came by to ask how things were and we asked for the check. He asked if we liked the ice cream- we said \"not really but thank you\" he said \"well it's not on your bill anyway\" and walked away. Look the food is fine- but the service is just garbage.",

I ordered the wagyu flat iron steak and my husband had the ribeye, both were amazing and did not disappoint. We had the twice baked potato and Parmesan risotto for sides, which were also very good. One area we felt could use some improvement were the appetizers. The bone morrow and tuna tartar were honestly just average, at best. Overall, I do recommend this restaurant for a nice reasonably-priced steak dinner right off the strip.",

    "text": "We went to the Barrymore for an intimate family dinner. The decor of the restaurant was cozy, yet luxurious. But on to the good stuff: The food. Which was delicious, but frankly, having read the reviews and for the price (which isn't unreasonable, but certainly not inexpensive) I expected nothing less.   For appetizers we had the lobster Mac and cheese and the diver scallops. The mac and cheese was very creamy, but slightly slacking in seasoning and lobster in my opinion. The scallop entree however, was delicious, and of that, we finished every last bite. For entrees, we had the bone-in rib eye, with lobster, and the Chilean sea bass on risotto. We also ordered a side of the twice-baked potato. ALL THE ENTREES (and side) WERE COOKED AND SEASONED TO PERFECTION. That being said, the lobster was hands-down our favorite part of the entire meal. OMG so buttery I could die LOL  What really blew me away at the Barrymore however, was the service. For starters, we originally made our late dinner reservations for 9:30, however as our show was running late, we wouldn't be able to make that time. I called to request if we could push our reservations back to 9:45/10 and the hostess was more than happy to accommodate. Moreover, throughout our meal, our servers were also extremely attentive and kind without being overbearing. They truly made it a point to make us feel special and to make sure we were enjoying our meal and ourselves, which made our experience just that much more enjoyable. And to add to the already wonderful meal, they brought us a complimentary piece of chocolate cake, which was a dessert/chocolate lovers dream! (Get it and you won't regret it )  Overall, if you're looking for a place to have a delicious and classy dinner, I highly recommend the Barrymore. We will definitely be paying them another visit some time soon",

For our main entree we ordered the Chilean sea bass and Leg of Lamb. The Chilean Sea Bass was just average, there was nothing special to it. The Leg of Lamb was also decent but not memorable. As a side we had the Cream Corn Lobster which was delicious.  The service was also very slow, I was expecting a higher level of service. Overall, the place is just ok.

The service was incredibly attentive but our steaks were overcooked. This is definately a place where you need to order your meat one level less than you really want it. (Order \"rare\" for \"medium rare\".) They would have re-cooked our meat and offered us free desert but we declined both.   All in all, I was surprised at what this place is relative to what it is.",

What a lavish dinner party it was! Please try not to mind the Royal Resort lobby too much as it is a little on the shabby side. The Barrymore makes up for the desperately needed renovation of the Royal Resort that is located off the strip.   Taking a shuttle bus from the wedding ceremony at the Aria to The Barrymore, pre dinner drinks were held at The Barrymore bar prior to seating. Once our seating was ready we were summoned into the dinning room that is lavish in royal blue table cloths, vintage gold wallpaper, a shiny gold ceiling covered with old film reels and a floor to ceiling wine cabinet that sectioned off the lounge and the dining room. The old hollywood glitz and glam vibe was spot on!   The beautifully framed dinner menu consisted of:  Starters  CESAR SALAD LOBSTER MAC AND CHEESE   Entrees  PASTA & SHRIMP ROASTED CHICKEN  SHORT RIB   Dessert  CHOCOLATE CAKE  LEMON CHEESE CAKE   Our table ordered everything except the pasta and short rib, so I was lucky to have tried almost the entire menu. EVERYTHING was exquisite! I initially ordered the Cesar salad as a starter and it was good, but once I tried that lobster Mac and cheese I quickly regretted my decision! Lol Here is where the Barrymore gets 5 stars for service; upon ordering the chicken entree with fingerling potatoes and veggies, we asked our server if it would be possible to pass along any extra lobster Mac and cheeses that might be  laying around, as a side dish. She informed us that there wasn't anything extra laying around, but, the chef could cook us up another lobster Mac and cheese! We were thrilled! And even more thrilled to be served such high quality food! Not like your typical over stocked banquet food with your traditional flavorless meat and fish options laying around in the back.   During dinner I asked the manager what the history behind The Barrymore was, as I thought there must be some correlation to Drew Barrymore and her family. The manager informed me that the restaurant isn't ran by the starlit family, but rather named after Drew Barrymore's grandfather. He also shared that they have Drew Barrymore's wine in stock! How cool is that?!   The chocolate cake was rich. The lemon cheese cake was out of this world. It had little mini lemon wafers on top that offered a zesty kick. Post dessert, heartfelt and humorous speeches were given by the maid of honor and best man. And to finish off the night, the groom gave a thank you speech. The restaurant was kind enough to select bottles of fine tequila to fill the little jarrito shot glasses brought as a present from the Grooms uncle, all the way from Mexico, and  counted as the final toast.   I glanced over at the Bride and Groom and everyone enjoying their meal. I was savoring the moment. Savoring the food and the complete bliss I had for my childhood friend-for the Newly Weds!",

We ordered the Smoked Bacon and the Lobster Mac and Cheese for appetizer.  Very satisfying.  The bacon was tender.. so so tender and tasted so good.  The Lobster Mac had truffle oil in which I loved.  It was creamy and it had a perfect lobster to pasta ratio. For entree we ordered the Chilean Seabass and the Braised Short Rib and the Oscar Fries (fries topped Oscar style with crab and sauce).  The Seabass was amazing tender with a crispy crust and it was drenched in sauce which I like.  The Short Rib was delicious.  Super tender.. just wish they added a little more of the jus. The Oscar Fries were HORRIBLE.  The sauce from the \"oscar\" tasted like mayo and mustard mixed and it left you with an after taste that was not pleasant.  The waitress said it was \"SOOOO GOOD\".   It wasn't!  It was \"SOOOO BAD\".   Their staff needs to be better trained at visiting tables.  Two different employees came to our table without introducing themselves just very dryly asked \"how's is everything\".  Then walked away.  It was just so weird the way they did it.",

Not the restaurants fault, but there food should have been brought out before anyone else's as that is the only time they stayed quite enough.

    "text": "The Barrymore, what a hidden gem!   My friend and I decided to try 3 new restaurants one night (apps, dinner, dessert) and chose The Barrymore as our first destination. We tasted only a few of their cocktails and small bites.  It's located inside the Royal Resort on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Convention Center Dr. It looks cozy and inviting from the outside with a long fireplace against the exterior wall. Once you walk inside the Royal Resort, you make a left to enter the restaurant.  The inside is stunning. Dark, vintage like decor. Makes a very intimate dinner/drinks setting.  The hostess greeted us right away and asked if we had reservations. We told her didn't and requested to sit at the bar which was completely empty on a Tuesday night. Our bartender, Corey, was friendly and had a very impressive mustache! He engaged with us in conversation and provided several useful recommendations.  For a drink I went with The Barrymore (big surprise I know!) which is their take of an Old Fashioned ($14). Strong and tasty not to my surprise with the zest of orange to add some flavor.  Corey told us the chef created an updated menu that launched 4 days ago on a Friday. The chef changed up a few menu items and we were excited to be one of the firsts to try. We decided to order the Grilled Octopus and the pan seared Foie Gras.   The Grilled Octopus ($17) had a charcoal grilled taste to it and was INCREDIBLY soft! It was a large portion of an octopus leg and was very tender. I'm not too familiar with octopus being prepared this way (I'm used to chewier, smaller pieces of octopus and squid legs) but I enjoyed this dish very much. It came with lentils and a piece of sausage. I was a little confused with this pairing but the sausage flavor went nicely with the octopus.   The pan seared Foie Gras ($24) was a small portion of duck liver that came with an apple sauce like substance and a tiny piece of ginger bread. The taste of duck liver was very strong in my opinion and I couldn't taste much seasoning on it. Luckily the sweetness of the apple sauce helped calm down the duck liver taste.  The Barrymore is definitely a pricier restaurant to visit but I really enjoyed my experience here! - 5/5 for the ambiance and service  - 5/5 for the cocktail  - 4/5 for the Grilled Octopus  - 3/5 for the Foie Gras   I would love to come back and give their dinner entrees a try. Perhaps a steak and another whiskey drink!",

The wagyu flat steak was coated with some spice that I wish they had noted so on the menu. It was very prominent and I wasn't a fan.  If I knew of this spice rub, I would have ordered the scallops instead.  I was able to eat a quarter of my steak before I called quits. The pistachio creme brulee was good.  Conclusion:  I will not be returning.",

We loved almost everything, over all good restaurant!   we loved: the atmosphere, style, decor of the place. service was attentive, and our apps and side dishes were excellent.  and the server surprised us with a complimentary dessert at the end which we loved!   we didn't love: our steak just wasn't great which is always a bummer at a nice steak house! and the upselling was a little aggressive from the server, but i get it, just trying to do his job. I'm a server too so i notice when i'm being up sold a lot.   over all good experience and we enjoyed the night!",

    "text": "The Barrymore is located off the lobby of the Royal Resort. Upon arrival I was expecting to see a parking valet but after a few minutes no one appeared.  I found ample parking along side the building, just a short walk to the front door. The dining room can be described in many ways. Intimate, cozy, romantic, old school, retro Las Vegas. All of these are appropriate. Velour booths, film reels on the ceiling, celebrity wall art, and bronze eagle statues are all part of the decor. The lights above each booth provides the right amount of ambiance. The background music consisted of easy listening standards and was a conversation friendly volume. On this night it was apparent the rodeo fans have discovered this place as there were many diners wearing hats.  The dining room is small by Las Vegas standards but the Barrymore is Large on service. Excellent service was provided throughout our diner experience. First on the scene our head server. Danny greeted us and explained that he will be assisted by two other wait staff members. They worked as a team and there was always someone checking on us, refilling water glasses and clearing plates. In addition the General Manager made the rounds, stopping to chat at each table. He also helped clear.   The bread basket had a variety of rolls and some cheese flat bread. The standout was the pretzel rolls, simply irresistible. The menu leans to the meat category although there are a few seafood choices. However, I believe this is a place  to go with the beef. Both of us ordered the 8 oz Filet Mignon. Mine medium rare and hers well done. The steaks were cooked perfect just as ordered. The size actually appeared to be larger than 8 oz. The grilled asparagus were grilled al dente and had a hint of smoke. The french fries were large pieces made with the skins on. Crisp outside tender inside and grease less.",

Without hesitation, beyond any shadow of a doubt, no ifs, ands or buts about it, The Barrymore was my absolute fave!  This place is stunning! Slightly off the grid yet still accessible I have no idea how this place hasn't caught fire on Yelp yet with slews of reviews. You know what? Maybe they don't want it that way. On that note, maybe I don't want it that way?! It's intimate, cozy, not overrun by riffraff from the strip and very confident in their current stance. I'd have it no other way!  The drinks are proper and the staff is beyond friendly. Blue cheese olives for that Martini? You bet your ass! A drink like this is perfectly aligned with the classy yet approachable decor and my only regret is not sticking around longer since we had a dinner to attend. You better believe that I'll be diving in head first to that sleek little dining room hidden behind the wall of wine on my next visit. This is my kind of spot!  Thanks Nate and thanks Barrymore!",

Only thing I did not like was when I got my bill, the Waiter needed to let me know more than once what my original total was. (I work in the industry so I know that the proper tip etiquette is to tip on the original total and not on the final discounted total.) He \"reminded\" me once again after he returned with my card to sign. It felt insulting that he needed to \"remind\" me. I still left about a 22% tip. Not sure if I'd return for a third time.",

She was kind, thoughtful and extremely helpful from the very first contact. The venue is absolutely beautiful and the food is to die for! We were treated like royalty by the entire staff. I've never experienced service like that at any restaurant or venue and I work in that industry. The cost is very reasonable for the level of service and quality of food. We were truly blown away and our wedding went off perfectly. They even sent us a thank you card and cookies from Hawaii (were we had our hooneymoon). Thank you to Kuuipo and the entire Barrymore staff for making our dreams a reality and supporting us along the way!",

It is small, intimate, classy and a throwback to the nostalgic days of Las Vegas 30 years ago.  The food is good, but I really enjoy their little bar the most.  It is small, it feels vibrant yet is intimate as well, it has a window wall to see outside and feel that sense of space and they are craftsman at making good cocktails.

Sometimes I forget the fantastic interior design of the small back area of the restaurant, only about 9 tables.  Get a booth and enjoy the vintage Vegas ambiance in these relatively new surroundings.  The menu remains tremendous, the service, presentations, stellar.  Manager Kirk Perry has been on top of things and they recently brought back my dear friend the chanteuse Nieve Malandra to perform in the bar on Thursdays again, which is a brilliant move.  I was looking forward to having my favorite waiter in town once again.  The server Israel Lopez has always made me look like a king at the Barrymore.  I was heartbroken to find he had passed away suddenly.  I have some great memories of having the pleasure of his expertise.  I will miss him.  Israel Lopez was a class act, may he rest in peace.  My condolences to his friends and family.  Good luck to Barrymore in finding that special person who can carry off that nuance.  I'll check in again soon.",

    "text": "Yelp steered me perfectly for a special birthday dinner pre-Elton John at the Colesseum.  We had to be at Caesars for a 7:30 show.  I made a 5:30 reservation through Open Table and noted both the birthday and our need to leave by 7 PM to make our show.  Even though we were about 10 minutes late, they got us out on time.  The host and our server were both aware of the birthday and the time constraint (without any prompting.)  Our server Bill was impeccable.  The perfect balance of charming, personable, professional and communicative.  He checked in at all the right times, was prompt and confident with recommendations and questions, and made sure the timing of every aspect of our meal (drinks, appetizer and entrees) were spaced appropriately and yet delivered promptly to keep us on schedule.  The restaurant decor was charming and cozy (it's a small place, so I'd strongly recommend reservations.)  It's located in a rather rundown casino, but the restaurant itself would be worthy of a spot in any high-end casino.   Your money spent here is clearly going into the quality of the food and the service rather than their rent.  It's actually quite easy to get to by Vegas standards.  You can park in a surface lot immediately adjacent to the hotel, walk into the hotel, follow signs to the left side of the lobby, and voila, you're there!  It took less than 5 minutes to park and get to our table, a rarity for dining at most restaurants inside most casinos.  The food - also amazing.  I never order lobster mac n' cheese (not really a favorite) but due to Yelp, we tried it, and did not regret it.  Creamy rather than gooey, fresh little bits of lobster throughout....YUM!  For our mains, we had the duck (out of this world, I was making little noises of delight) and the short rib (he was awfully quiet, which always means he's really loving it.)  My cocktail was interesting, and his wine was fabulous.  We loved every bit of the Barrymore.  Thank you equally to the kitchen and to the dining room for making it a memorable birthday dinner!",

    "text": "This place is so deceiving because it is in a cheesy looking hotel. But...  The food was incredible. We had sweetbread and lobster mac and cheese. ( or crack and cheese as we called it). My duck was very good and I love having breast and leg, with both cooked different. Just to be fair, the Brussel sprouts were not our favorite and the dessert was ok, but seriously everything else was so good. My co-workers had steak and it was really good (yeah, I tried their'a, don't judge me) and it was not the best steak I have had but still really good.   Best part was we read a side dish for a different meal and asked for that as a side and they did it!  That was huge to me in service.   Wanted to give 4.5 stars because of the dessert but couldn't. Would so go here again",

    "text": "I would have never known about The Barrymore if it wouldn't have been for Yelp. The Barrymore is off the strip in a hotel I have never heard of.   When I pulled up to the hotel for dinner on Mother's Day it was completely empty. Before entering you see The Barrymore sign with lights surrounding it and fire below it.   The three of us were seated at a booth that was both comfortable and spacious. The restaurant is very intimate and great for conversation.  First, the waitress brought out a bread basket which had pretzel bread, parmesan crackers, and epi baguette. The pretzel bread was the star, it may have been the best thing I put in my mouth all night.  I chose two appetizers as my main course; the caesar salad and the rock shrimp carbonara. Others at the table ordered duck muscovy; mashed potatoes; squash curry. The waitress brought out the caesar salad first. Salad was crisp and fresh, dressing contained too much mayonnaise; croutons were an after thought. I am not usually a huge fan of shrimp, but the rock shrimp here was cooked and seasoned well. However the sauce tasted nothing like a carbonara, it tasted more like a garlic butter sauce. The presentation of this dish was almost there except for the pieces of bacon thrown on the plate. The bacon was unnecessary when there was already chunks of bacon in the dish.  For dessert, I asked the waitress for her recommendation and said her favorite was the chocolate raspberry tart. After reading the description I didn't know whether it was a tart or a flourless chocolate cake. She said it should say flourless chocolate crumbs which are surrounding the tart. I decided to go with her recommendation even though I normally regret listening to suggestions from the wait staff. The presentation of this dish was the best part. All the flavors were mediocre. The tart itself was not crunchy enough and had no flavor. The raspberry part tasted like a store bought raspberry jam.   Overall, the best thing about this restaurant is the retro decor along with an intimate setting.",

    "text": "Our new go-to spot after massive trade shows in Vegas.   1st let me say that we've never stepped foot inside the restaurant. We 1st went to the Barrymore on the recommendation of the bartender at LBS once he told us it was closing and promised to send down their recipes for the Pork & Mary and the Cucumber Mary. 1 has made it.   Our 1st visit was after an especially trying day at CES. We had clients who wanted old Vegas ambiance but not the schelp to DTLV. Normally I don't take clients a first time before I'd tried it but I was brain damaged from the CES overload.   What a GEM! Tucked away in a non-descript hotel, The Royal - it was like walking back in time. Cool, loungy vibe coupled with a variety of seating. It was chilly so we opted not to sit on the patio but on one of the comfortable couches just inside the bar.   I mentioned to our waiter - who was quick to bring us menus and take our order that we'd been referred by LBS and did they have anything close to the Pork & Mary or the Cucumber Mary. A very quick chat with the bartender & wallah.. cucumber Marys all around.   The Drinks:  ample and during happy hour - only $5.00!  4 people 4 rounds - awesome!   The food:  We've been back many times since. Our recommendations would be the roasted artichoke; the wild boar & the crispy pork belly. Perfect accompaniment to soak up the cocktails.   Ambiance: The 1st time I went looking out the huge windows I could almost imagine I was back home in NYC. Evening light on the high rises with the golden glow that is Vegas.  Once the weather was consistently above 60 we moved to the patio. Comfortable banquet seating with just the right touch of torches for light & heat.   Service:  I cannot say enough about this. We've been there 4 times since January. Each time it has been better. The 1st time we went during CES - the manager came over and bought us a round of drinks. Who does that anymore? The bartender gave us the recommendation for some of the newer additions (the wild boar) his latest cocktails - we are still bound to bloody marys & Block 16 newly opened locations.",

Royal Hotel (self-styled \"Royal Resort\"!), so I give it plus points for that. The Royal is in kinda a random location, but it's close enough to head to the strip after or just home if you're old and have kids, like me. The main reason I love the Barrymore bar is because I feel so cool drinking there and bringing guests to drink there. It's like you know about a secret hipster hangout....fancy hipsters, not PBR-swilling types! The decor is awesome, in a golden age of Hollywood kinda way, and the drinks are delicious. Cocktails are also pretty reasonably priced, considering the near-strip location and the fancy menu at the restaurant.",

Mirrors, movie reels, leather booths, and low lighting make the Barrymore a romantic spot to drink from their great wine list and eat food that was the quality of food from higher priced restaurants.  We had the mussels and lobster, both were great.  Our server was a wonderful girl who was happy to give us well guided advice on the food so that we could make a decison on what to order.  The restaurant was located less than a fourth of a block off Las Vegas Blvd and could be gotten to from the bus or the Monorail, so don't let it being off the strip stop you from visiting.",

Our bill for 2 people came to $202, but $60 of that was drinks and another $50 of that was appetizers because I wanted to try foie gras (since I've never had it) AND the lobster mac & cheese (since it's like their specialty).  So if you're strapped for cash I think you could probably feed 2 people for under $100 if you order wisely.  Bring enough for a good tip because our waiter was awesome.  The food is really good, and since it's not located on the main strip the place wasn't very crowded.  You still need to make a reservation, but I was able to get one about 5 hours before dinner time on a Thursday night.  There are a few restaurants in Vegas that are of similar quality but they all cost significantly more.  If you want to eat at a really nice place and get a good bang for your buck, the Barrymore is for you.",

Certainly old world where you could imagine the likes of the rat pack hanging out here. What about the food? Simply put it is excellent. The octopus is delicious. The lobster mac n cheese ok but needs a touch more lobster. The place is known for its steaks and they don't disappoint. Couple these  with a great red from their extensive list and you have a perfect night. Can't recommend this place enough. If you are looking to go somewhere special, come here. You will enjoy it. If you are looking for something fast and typical don't come. Not your type of place.",

I'm so compelled to say it was a thoroughly fantastic experience, consisting of great food, service, and of course, the atmosphere.   Our server Luis was very pleasant and attentive, as was the rest of the staff. He made great suggestions, and everything we had was delicious. From what I ordered I would definitely recommend the Lobster Mac & Cheese and the Rick Shrimp, though everything was superb. We'll definitely be making our way back!",

    "text": "Another excellent restaurant by the folks at Block 16 Hospitality. I finally made it to the Barrymore a few weeks ago before my Groupon expired. We were seated in the smaller of the two dining rooms shortly after arriving. It was a last minute decision because we realized the Groupon was going to expire the next day, so we had the kid in tow for an early (6ish) dinner.  We went with two soups to start. The French onion soup ($8.50) is traditional in appearance and as good as any other version we've tried in town. The vegetable curry soup with crab ($7) was a daily special not listed on the menu that was poured table side. The smooth and rich soup was loaded with a spiciness that was moderate in heat, yet bold enough to satisfy.  Normally, their lounge menu isn't available in the main dining rooms, but they were kind enough to make an exception for our kid, who wanted their chicken fingers ($10). The order was larger than expected, with four substantial strips of lightly breaded chicken and a mound of crispy skinny fries.  After visiting all the other Block 16 spots, I've noticed that one of their most popular accompaniments to their dishes is their bacon marmalade. It can be found on their burgers at LBS and Holsteins and a few dishes at Public House. You can't really blame them, though because it adds a sweet, smokey flavor to dishes like the short rib entree ($28) at the Barrymore. I prefer the short rib dish at Public House, but the one here still has a mouthwatering, savoriness to it. Although it could have been larger and more tender.  On the other hand, the pan roasted Muscovy duck breast ($24) was a generous hunk of meat, cooked medium, with a slightly crispy skin. The creamy polenta and cherry-foie gras jus intensified the richness of the dish, making it easy for me to wipe the plate clean.  We split a side of the cream corn and lobster with bacon ($11). My wife liked it but I wasn't a huge fan. Their bread basket was filled with four or five varieties. The bacon roll was clearly my favorite.  The drinks were excellent and reasonably priced (at least by Strip standards). The Spring Buzz ($13, Hanger One Maine wild blueberry, Kubler absinthe ginger beer, fresh lemon, berry syrup) was good and strong. The Au Bon Climat pinot noir and Lyeth meritage were good accompaniments to our dishes. If you're looking for bottles, their list includes 50 under $50.  The service was solid and surprisingly we saw two or three other parties with kids. The staff didn't seem to mind and made us feel welcome. Although maybe the smaller dining area is where they stick all the people ballsy enough to bring their offspring?  Minus the Groupon, the total for dinner was around $150. It may not be as good as many of the top Strip restaurants, but it is a good value in unique setting that's close enough (or far enough) to the Strip to attract both tourists and locals alike.",

    "text": "Retro chic from the bygone era of American classic films collides with reinvented American cuisine to create an interesting; ummm unique; ok, different, dining adventure.  The food sounds familiar but the updated approach to their preparation is not.  Sometimes, grandmas recipes can be improved upon but sometimes its best to leave a classic alone.  The seared foie with a vanilla French toast and cherry chutney is perfectly balanced and delicious.  Use the toast to mop up the foie fat and wow, the flavors are sublime.  Successful reinvention!  Then there is the steak tartare with a lemon creme fraiche and an olive tepenade that mask the raw beef flavor and instead heighten the metallic flavor. Eek.  For mains, top props to the fried free range chicken drizzled with a honey-sherry glaze.  Juicy, crispy, and a finger licking good sweet / acidic glaze.  The crispy Korean style pork belly is OK.  The accompanying kimchee fried rice is not.  Flat flavor and oily.  Finally, the steaks, the servers claim their prime but they are definitely not top prime or well aged.  A little tough.  A little lacking in beefy goodness.   Service is very good.  Nice selection of wines.  The 50 under $50 list is well chosen and offers some good value.  The Captains List has some great finds if you are willing to look but the lack of organization and obscene overpricing of top wines make it hard for any connoisseur to take seriously ('00 Mouton $2900 [$1200 over retail], '00 Lafite $5800 [$3300 over retail]).  The Barrymore fills the void, providing a Strip like, exclusive dining experience without the Strip prices or hassle.  Is it worth it?  That's for you to decide.",

Gorgeous bar and dining room---intimate setting, dark, romantic.  Loved it.  Pan seared foie gras with vanilla bean french toast, fig & cherry chutney. On my list of Top Dishes Ever Eaten. I wanted more! All to myself!    Caesar salad -- romaine hearts with garlic-parmesan dressing, shaved parmesan.  Delish!  Steakhouse Burger-- grass-fed beef patty, bacon marmalade, gruyere cheese, frisee, oven-roasted tomatoes, garlic aioli. People have called this the Best Burger in Vegas. I haven't eaten many burgers in Vegas, but it was fabulous!  Seared Ahi with creamy polenta & porcini ragout with braised greens & pinot noir reduction. Amazing!  We love sidecars---the Barrymore made a great one.  Assorted bread basket came with our meal.    Dinner for two, including drinks and appetizers was about $170.  Service was excellent.  Don't let the location fool you.  Located in a hotel that is extremely unimpressive from the outside, The Barrymore is a True Vegas gem.  I can hardly wait to return!",

    "text": "After having a perfect dinner here the BF and I couldn't wait to go back.   We decided to come back for lunch to have their lunch offerings. I was real curious of their lobster roll but unfortunately it got taken off the menu a few weeks prior. We also wanted to know, is this the best burger in Vegas?   Grilled fish tacos - these were pretty decent. The fish were fresh and came 2 to a order. I like the grilled pepper and onion on the side - just like San Diego tacos. It came with their fries which were wonderfully sprinkled with fried herbs that added something special to their very crisp thin fry.   Steakhouse burger- we asked for medium rare and it came out well done, no pink at all. We haven't eaten a red meat in 5 months so it made me sad that rare meat meal was not. It was juicy enough for a well done burger so I can still tell it was quality meat. The bun was nice and the sweet carmelized onion-y BBQ sauce was fantastic. I dipped the fries in only that So far, to answer my own question - Bradley Ogden still wins.   The manager here was really great about it though and was apologetic and asked if he can get us a dessert. We got a coconut panna cotta w/ mango and a pink pepper merengue crisp. Desserts here are a strong point as all the desserts we've had here impressed the BF who normally doesn't give a crap about after dinner desserts.  Service was alright during the meal. It trailed off in the end when we were given our check but was held hostage by our server. Nothing gets me more antsy than that. I can wait for good food. I can excuse a bit if it is really busy. When you know a person it trying to leave I would get back to them in 1-2 mins of dropping it off instead of going off. Not also the time you want to make a guest anxious as it is the closest time to tip time.   Between the burger and the hostage situation, I think dropping a star is fair. I would go during dinner though. From my last reviews, there's this bartender with glasses and this one male server who is a absolute veteran that will make it shine. My last service and food experiences at night have been stellar enough that I'll be coming back of course.",

    "text": "I have tried to come here a few times and it has always feel through due to circumstances in their kitchen or time restraints. I finally got a chance to dine here this afternoon and I instantly forgot about all the past frustrations.   I came in around 11:30am and got sat right away in the front parlor. With  large windows to my left, I had ample amounts of natural light to read and pace my meal. I have worked in many restaurants and feel like the Barrymore is one of the best with timing. They coursed out my meal with exceptional precision. The wait between each dish was minimal to almost nonexistent. Lindsey did a phenomenal job on checking up on me. She had this section by herself and it got busy halfway through my meal. At this point, the rest of the staff jumped in to remove finished plates and refill waters.   I started off with a cocktail. The spring buzz was the perfect drink for this hot summer day. It is a mixture of Hangar One Wild Blueberry, Kubler Absinthe, ginger beer, fresh lemon, berry syrup. Hangar One is my favorite infused vodka. It can be served on the rocks and be easily appreciated. Barrymore, you had me at ginger beer. The drink was zippy, fresh, and light. I did not get a buzz from it, but was enamored with the bits of berries floating around from the house made syrup.   A cocktail to sip, a book in hand, and a few minutes to kill before my french onion soup came out was the backdrop for a wonderful experience. Once the soup arrived, it was a cauldron of aromatic beauty. Dig past the layer of melted cheese and baguette leads to a bounty of caramelized onions in a rich broth. If I was in the comfort of my own home, I would have tipped the bowl over to get every succulent drop.  A warm belly in the summer time does not always feel pleasant, but I was in a insouciant mood. Beads of sweat was making their way down my brow, but my bibb and heart of palm salad rectified that quickly. The combination of give from the heart of palm balanced the slight crisp from the lettuce and the smoother texture of the tomato and egg. There was no complaint about the creamy dressing. It did not weigh down the salad and was obviously homemade.   The previous two dishes was my attempt at being an appetizer yet I felt it could have been my whole meal in retrospect. Satisfaction had long washed over me, but a steakhouse burger was to come. I am on the search for the perfect burger and it was gratifying. The kitchen cooked it to a cool pink center. I had crossed the threshold of hunger into a whole new realm. I could not truly savor the multifaceted meal due to my state of excess, so packed up the remaining three quarters and called it a day. What I did taste was divine. The mix of frisee greens and the bacon marmalade with caramelized onions stood out against the more subtle gruyere cheese. The steak sauce on the side is a complimentary element to everything on the plate. Especially the seasoned fries.   Tapping out before dessert, I am given an excuse to come back and visit again. It was a pleasant experience from beginning to end.",

    "text": "Social Hour: short but sweet, very limited but inexpensive menu, all the food was very good.  I ordered a Caesar and oysters and iced tea to start, then decided to also get an octopus nicoise. I ended up pretty full, and this was essentially our dinner.  We had a party of five and had very comfortable seating on the patio, with just enough room for all of our plates and drinks after a little creative arrangement. The patio itself has an amazing air of privacy and was the perfect temp, with just a sweater after the sun set.  I recommend the mussels, my fiancee ordered them and they were tender and flavorful and sizeable. The oysters were good, the octopus was perfectly cooked in the nicoise (though I wish there had been some component reminiscent of egg in the classic..) and the Caesar was crisp fresh and just a little different with Serrano ham and a sardine on top. My friends report that the lemondrops they had were also top notch. Overall, we ended up spending not very much for 5 people at happy hour.. Average of $30 each plus tip. When you consider the caliber of the food and the fact that we left full on small plates, it is a great value.",

I will tell you we took some heat from the bell man at The Encore and taxi driver about heading to The Royal Hotel and with that prep were a little anxious when we arrived there...the lobby was empty.  But the massive door to The Barrymore is right off the lobby and it is like stepping into another world!  Full of people having cocktails, the outside sitting area with the fireplaces, great drinks.  A short wait later and we were show to our table.  The decor of the dining room is spectacular with old film reels on the ceiling.  Emily our server did a wonderful job and our dinners were fantastic.  This is a steakhouse....but I chose the pan seared salmon. Delicious.  My partner had a rib eye, cooked to perfection.  The wine list is expansive.  All in all what a wonderful experience!  I give it a five out of five.",

    "text": "Been here twice.  First time was with my master for her bday.  Everything from the food to the service I recalled was nothing short of excellent.     We started off with the French Onion Gratin and Chicken Matzo Balls Soup.  Both were amazing, but if i had to pick I would order the French Onion soup only because I prefer delicate veggies in my soup.  Add some soggy bread and a thick layer of Gruyere cheese to that sweet beefy broth, and it will warm up any belly.  I had the Pan Seared Foie Gras to myself, and as always an order is never enough.   I appreciate that they didn't unify the whole dish together because to me it's more enjoyable to build each bite than to dismantle to my preference.  For our main course we had the rich, savory Beef Ribs over a carrot mousselin.  It was so tender that we barely applied any pressure with a spoon to trim it.  To top off our entree off we order a Cream of Spinach and Mash Potatoes which is more like a Puree.  I think we could have done without the Spinach for as the whole meal was just too heavy.  We we're too full to order dessert, but they sent out a sorbet for us anyways.  Sweet!  Second time I came for their Steak Burger after all the reviews i read.  Seriously, wow. It was all that and a bag of chip!  My burger was cooked perfectly (med-rare), piled with bacon marmalade, topped with chopped crispy lettuce, and i think sliced tomatoes were up in the mix too.    I find the the additions of onions gave the burger an uncommon sweeter side yet still kept that smokey flavor.  Pick it up a few notches by adding their signature Barrymore Sauce (mixture of ketchup and A1 with a little more tang) and you'll be savoring each bite.  Don't be shy to dip your fries in the Barrymore Sauce too.  It's an all-purpose condiment!   Comes with a basket of herbs fries, a slice of dill pickle.  Worth the every penny at $13.5.  I've been quite eager to share my new discovery with my friends.  Highly recommend this place to anyone.",

    "text": "We wanted to try this place for over a year. Finally, we did.  Atmosphere: Very cool/different setting. I felt like I was almost eating dinner at Hogwarts (lol) or on a fancy train because of the setting.  Very small, intimate dining room and nice setting.  Food: The bread basket was amazing as they provided pretzel bread and a few other untraditional bread choices. Man, the pretzel bread/roll was amazing.  Caesar salad, scallops, pork belly, and lobster Mac n cheese appetizers were tasty (8.5 out of 10). The filet mignon was tasty once it was refired (will discuss below).  The lobster bisque was not as good as most I've had (7 out of 10). Everyone enjoyed their food and I was pleasantly full. The desserts were delicious and we sampled a few.   Service: The waiter we had was awful. The waiter refused to bring my wife her diet soda, me some lemons for my club soda, forgot to bring a bottle of wine to the table as requested, and failed to do the above numerous times.  Both of the steaks that were ordered were cooked two levels beyond what the requested and had to be re-ordered. With a dining room so intimate, there is no reason why the waitstaff could not be extremely attentive to the needs of the tables. The waiter that we had was completely ill-equipped and did not deserve to work there.  After requesting the manager and voicing all of our issues, we were given some free desserts. We were still very upset about the service we got as the desserts did not nearly make up for the terrible waiter.  The Bill: This place seems to charge more than they should for what they are. It also seemed like they were trying to be a couple notches above the level of class that they were as far as plating of the food and quality of service was considered. The prices were way too high for what we received. We had four people in our party, ordered a bottle of sparkling water, a bottle of cheaper wine, two martinis, one soda, five or six appetizers, and three entrees. With a 10% tip, the bill came out to $380.   Thankfully, we were in great company and had a blast talking and joking with our friends. We will not be returning to the Barrymore.",

We are seated behind a large table of twenty people and are afraid we'd be lost to good service, but, were surprised we had a very attentive server and felt like we're the only ones in the room.  I started with a drink, the Barrymore, gentleman jack, solerno blood orange liqueur, orange marmalade, cocchi vermouth di torino, orange bitters, and orange zest.  it was warming to the soul!  Our appetizers included several.  First we got the lobster mac & cheese, it is smothered with a  mascarpone-tallegio cream sauce, very creamy and so so good.  We also got the heirloom tomato & burrata cheese salad. It had cucumbers, oregano, extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, served with the best tomatoes, cut in thick slices, and the cheese is a cream induced mozzarella, the flavors are a cool delight.  We also got the deviled eggs and a lobster bisque soup.  Both of these were very good as well.  We're getting full, but our main entrees are to come.   I choose the diver scallops, big scallops wrapped with serrano ham, the sauce is a saffron rouille and boullabaisse broth.  These were some of the best scallops I have had.  To finish off the meal, I got a tispy earl, harvey's bristol cream sherry with earl gray tea.  This was one of the best meals I can recall eating.  The service was great, the food cooked to perfection and the memory, unbeatable.  Thanks to my husband for a great choice!",

The managers and wait staff were available throughout the night if we needed them. Stevie (Sales Manager) made the planning easy and was lovely.

The Barrymore seemed perfect when researching on yelp. I was still a bit skeptical when we rolled in to the royal resort by taxi and I could tell by the look on the face of one in my party that she was a bit scared. When we got inside, I knew it was going to be good. We started on the patio for drinks. Everybody was having a good time and our drinks were great! O.K. Everybody was loosening up a bit, feeling a bit better about my choice. Our waiter came over and he was awesome. Very attentive and knowledgable. He made recommendations, was funny an really added to the feel of the place.  First the bread basket came out. The pretzel roll was delicious! I ordered the bone in rib eye and it was spot on. Fantastic steak! Across the board, our dinners were great.  One of the best dining experiences I have had in Vegas. I don't eat at too many places twice in Vegas but I will definitely return to the Barrymore. Fantastic!",

    "text": "My girlfriend is a trained chef, and we both agreed the food was impeccable. Chilean sea bass and sea scallops, both perfectly cooked and served nice and hot. The vegetables were farm fresh as well. We sat pretty near the kitchen and she loved the smells coming from there too.  The decor is very cool and elegant, Las Vegas meets Hollywood, Rat Pack film noir, complete with gold film reels covering the ceiling. With period music to boot. The clientele looked very with it, no wife-beater tank tops & fanny packs here. The Royal Resort location that houses the Barrymore off the Strip looks empty and forgotten, but that's what they said about the South Beach, FL hotels in the 80s, so I expect the hipsters to show up and make it a cool place.  The only star deduction comes from the fact that the $30+ entrees are served on just garnish. All sides, such as vegetables, must be ordered separately at $10+, sending the meal into quite expensive territory. Our waiter pushed the sides on me, saying in effect I had to order one, and we noticed him aggressively pushing bottle upon bottle of wine, including $200 bottles, to the table nearby. When we didn't order alcohol (we don't drink), nor dessert (we had already eaten sweets that day & are health-conscious), we got the short shrift from the waiter.  All in all, an excellent meal, just make sure you manage your money and keep your head amidst the up-selling, like you do in the casino.",

The service is very good and professional.  The staff is well train.  I am not surprise that the person who served us has a degree in hotel management or something like that.  Appetizer, we ordered lobster mac cheese and foie gras.  Main dish, my boyfriend had aged bone-in filet mignon and bone marrow, and I had petite filet mignon (not petite at all), bone marrow and lobster tail.

It was just a little bit weird eating in an empty room with almost personal service.  We started with cocktails, a boubon old fasioned and a belini.  I am always looking for a good bourbon cocktail and although it does not rank in my top 5 I would highly recommend it.    The food was delicious.  We shared an appetizer of fried artichoke which was stellar.  We each has salads (chopped and a bibb lettuce and hearts of palm) and both were very fresh and dressed well.  The salads are quite large and in hindsight we probably should have split one.  For entrees we had the scallops and the sea bass.  Both were quite good - we thought the scallop dish was the better of the 2.  The sea bass was quite a lot of food and very hearty.  The service from hostess to server to management was really quite good.  I really had a sense that they all really care about this restaurant and will do their best to make their diners happy.  All in all really good food in a decent atmosphere (assuming that the dining room is more full).  I'd probaby give 3.5 stars but since that is not allowed I give 4 based on the low prices (probably the least expensive meal we had in Vegas) and the really good service.",

The restaurant does seem a bit out of place in The Royal Resort but don't let that keep you away. Royal Resort is set just off the part of the strip that now seems deserted due to the economic crisis.  Here is what we had.  Wife: French Onion Gratin - She said it was delicious. Pan Roasted Chicken - She eats a lot of chicken when we dine out and she loved this. I finished what she didn't eat and I can vouch that it was very good.  Me: Baby Iceberg Salad with bacon, blue cheese, tomatoes and Russian dressing. It was a great way to start my meal.  My main course was the Short Rib (with carrot mousseline, red pearl onion, bacon marmalade, natural jus). Simply put: It was the best short rib I have ever had. It was absolutely amazing.  We split a side of asparagus that was perfectly cooked. There was also a basket of bread on the table which I appreciated.  Drinks-  I had their signature drink \"The Barrymore\" which is made with Gentleman Jack. I'm not much of a Jack drinker but I tried this and enjoyed it very much.  My wife had wine off of their extensive wine menu.  The Service was absolutely terrific. The people working here were extremely friendly and attentive. Our entire experience at this restaurant was excellent. We will be coming back again on our next trip to Vegas and you should make it a point to go there when you are in town.",

    "text": "Love, love this place. As my brother-in-law stated, \"the best steak I've had in a long time.\" He is a good cook, too. We were looking for something cool, relatively legit local place (e.g., not in a big hotel or restaurant chain) and retro 50s Vegas feel. This had it all -- great old school cocktails, awesome live jazz, excellent food, super nice and good service. We went two nights in a row as a result of our first dinner there, and we will definitely go back.",

Recommend the Lobster Mac & Cheese as an appetizer.  There's also an outdoor bar area with misters to keep you cool.  You can order half price appetizers outside the main restaurant from 5-7.",

    "text": "Having visited The Barrymore twice previously for lunch, I was looking forward to giving it a shot for dinner. Unfortunately, bad service and below average food ensure I won't be returning for a fourth time.   Our group received slow service every step of the way. Despite the restaurant being 3/4 empty, we had a long wait to be seated, receive menus, have our orders taken, receive our food and get the check. We had to ask for a drink menu and bread. We had long stretches when our server was nowhere in sight.   I ordered the filet cooked medium. It was raw. Others in our group also received their food undercooked.   I liked The Barrymore as a hidden gem away from the bustle of the Strip, but after this experience I won't return and will quit recommending it to others.  Update: Management from The Barrymore contacted me as a result of this review in an effort to get more information and to make things right. I declined the offer for a comped meal, but the genuine concern from management is a good sign that they're trying to do the right thing.",

    "text": "First off I rarely write reviews unless I find a restaurant that is off the grid. This is a hidden gem.  We found this place on restaurant week and will definitely be regulars.  We had the lobster Mac and cheese, which tasted amazing and had a ridiculous amount of lobster. Next course was an perfectly cooked 8 oz filet with the creamiest potatoes and asparagus.  For dessert I had the creme brulee and my wife had the chocolate cake (I don't like chocolate and I would order this next time). The portions were large and the taste was out of this world.  We choose the wine pairing, this was a 35$ add on for 4 amazing glasses of wine.   The entire experience was better than any restaurant week restaurant we have ever been to.  This includes high end casinos and steak houses.  This meal was at the 50$ price point and was way better than meals we had at the 80$ price point. The staff was friendly, knowledgable, and attentive. If you have not been here go!!!!!  You get a high end steak house experience at the cost of a local family diner.  We will be back!!!!",

    "text": "Great ambiance, fair price.  The waitor was very polite, but they were short of staff, so we didn't have as much attention when we needed him.  We ordered the bone in rib eyes, it was moist, flavorful and cooked to the way we expected.  The mushroom side dish was delicious.  Chocolate cake was so so.  The foie gras was a must try.  Would recommend you to try it once if you have already gone to other steak house and need a change",

    "text": "Everything about The Barrymore made for a fantastic dining experience. Grab cocktails (the Cherry Picker was amazing!) and head out to the patio before your dinner reservation. The hostess was timely in escorting us to our booth in the dining area that feels like you've been immersed in an episode of Mad Men (check out the ceiling that is made of old time movie projector reels). A fabulous wine list awaits you with a wide selection. The food...absolutely delicious! Great appetizer selection and the steaks and sides were superb. Chocolate raspberry tart was the perfect finisher paired with our cabernet sauvignon. And the best thing of all, the price...a high quality meal without the Vegas Strip prices",
