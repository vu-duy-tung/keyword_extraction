The curly fries far outshine the regular fries. The shakes are good and it's great that they use almond milk. A few tweaks and this place would be amazing. I wish you could add grilled onions to a burger and if they had some more condiments. They only had ketchup. No mustard pickles or relish. Still overall someone making the effort for a vegan fast food is Amazing and I give chef Kenny props!",

It comes with a tartar sauce and it is cooked to perfection. The sweet potato fries were good in flavor but weren't crispy. That was a little miss for me. I will absolutely be back!

Visited on a Sunday at noon; was somewhat surprised to see Chef Kenny in attendance working the kitchen.    Was so good, we went back the next day.  Between our group we tried the burger, fish taco, beef sandwich, regular fries, curly fries and zucchini fries.  Everything was superb.  Particularly the beef sandwich which was very similar to a bahn mi.  Lots of the menu is fried and all was a  little greasy.  I'm unsure how healthy this is but like any fast food place, it should be more like a treat and not a daily source of nourishment.  Vegan fast food is an interesting concept and not only do I wish Chef Kenny well in this endeavor, I'm looking forward to going back next year.",

The zucchini, my favorite was tossed In tempura and it wasn't covered all over, some pieces had no tempura at all. The wait was very long. Like a 20 plus min wait in Togo window.  The ranch was so-so. watered down and there was barely any sauce for the portion.  I really enjoy the Veggie House so I wish they would have brought some of those elements to this location.  My total for the three items was $13 and change. Not affordable when I only really ate the taco. Still hungry rummaging thru my fridge. I heard the burgers were winners so we will see. I haven't had a shake yet, I will probably give it a second chance, and try something different but these items are out.",

The \"burger\" was extremely tasty with that hearty, meaty feel.  The \"cheese\" was melty (which, if you're vegan, you know is very hard to find) and delicious - and saved me from my lactose intolerance.  I also got a side of the fried zucchini which was straight from heaven.  The vegan ranch that came with it was not-so-much: a bit watery, but the flavor itself was decent.

    "text": "The fact that I have gone here twice in a row for the past 3 days as I write this review probably says a lot about how much I have come to appreciate Vegeway.  Initially when they first opened, I absolutely hated their burgers and vowed to never come back after my first try - the \"cheese\" made me lose my appetite for it made the burger taste too sweet for my liking and just made me want to find the nearest In-N-Out as quick as possible.   Fast forward to half a year later and becoming vegan for almost 5 months, my palate has definitely changed (or the establishment has gotten better since they opened) and I was very impressed after trying the Hawaiian Burger - super tasty, juicy, onions were caramelized nicely - and the Beef Bahn Mi sandwich. The next day we came back to try the Double Vegan Burger and the chicken burger (but they mistakingly gave us the single vegan burger instead - but I guess shame on us for not double checking our drive thru order). We seriously felt like we were eating an In-N-Out burger which has officially fulfilled our craving since becoming vegan!   Prices are honestly pretty steep (prepare to spend almost $20+ on fast food but hey, this ain't no McDonald's & you do get what you pay for!). I do appreciate the various choices such as wraps, salad, popcorn chicken, etc. if you're not feeling up for burgers.   Overall, a must try if you're in the mood for a plant based alternative to your Big Mac and fries. Thanks to Chef Kenny for another delicious vegan creation!",

Stick to the cheeseburger and fries though. One time I ordered the Bahn Mi sandwich and it was zero fun. Also, even though it's \"fast food\" it takes about 20 min to get your order, so be ready for that too.",

I like the concept, but after trying the burger and the tacos. I was extremely disappointed. The food is really trash, the veg. burger is so bad that upon taking the first bite it stuck to the roof of my mouth and I realized that I'm an idiot for getting 2 patties, cause with each subsequent bite i took I had to use the goddamn drink straw andmy tongue to get the sticky soy patty off the roof of my mouth. I only ate half of the $8 burger and threw it out. The fish taco that I got was alright, but nothing mindblowing. There are better fish taco places around the corner and they are way cheaper.   I'd have given this place at least 2 stars, but the service was abysmal at the drive through. There were 2 girls free with only my car at the drive-thru. They made an eye contact with me 5 times in the 2 minutes I was there, but didn't come to take the order. The lack of service and shitty food make this restaurants one of the rare ones that I give 1 star review to.",

    "text": "Ehhh, I am not feeling it. I was pretty excited to try this place because of so many raving reviews I've been seeing on social media, but what a letdown. First of all, I enjoy Vegan eats and the lack of meat is not what's missing here. There was just nothing spectacular or even remotely special about this place or its food.  I selected the Double V Burger Meal with Curly Fries and a Drink ($9.89). Certainly not a cheap meal. The burger was ugly and a far cry from their photos (I thought this only happened at major fast food brands?). Their patties are misrepresented as the real product is extremely thin, plus, the fresh vegetables were almost non-existent (there was seriously a leaf of lettuce that didn't even over the size of the bun and these buns are not big). The bottom line, it didn't taste great. It wasn't bad, but I'm certain that it has nearly the same amount of calories/sodium as its non-Vegan counterpart and totally not worth it. To add to the already insulting meal, the side of fries was dismal and probably the same ones you find in the grocery store's freezer section.   If you're looking for a Vegan place based solely on the fact that you do not consume animal products, then, it's here (though there are so many better Vegan restaurants in town). However, if you're looking to eat healthier, this is NOT the place for you. Vegan does not equal healthy!",

Today it tasted foul left me feeling like i needed to vomit right after not settling right in my stomach at all, I don't know how you guys cooked it but tasted like old grease and high cholesterol!   4: orange chicken , i had it once before it was crispy it was orangy i was perfect .... today it lacked the flavor tasted like balls of grease and soggy cotton balls ! Not happy at all!    So here's the deal , every visit should always be better than the last visit ! I always leave bad reviews to remind people that the negative issues will always stand out before the positive issues and when a customer as in me is paying for a expected product of food it should be like the last time or better, i haven't had this place in a few weeks because I'm always busy but today had the chance and did not live up to the hype! I'd like to rate this place 5 stars and would willing to do so if they are willing for it to change! Other than that i won't say stay away because it's not bad but when you go the distance it should be great!",

I chose not to look at any reviews or any ratings because I wanted to have a purely unbiased opinion.   The 100% vegan version of In & Out Burger but 10 times Better! I ordered the strawberry milkshake, chicken nuggets, curly fries, zucchini, and double burger. From the first bite into the burger to the last swallow of the shake, it was vegan heaven.   The employees were very friendly, the music and ambience was fantastic. Me and my girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed our experience in every way possible as customers.   Not only is this place beyond amazing, the prices make it easy on the pockets so you can fully enjoy your burgers and fries. Oops! and did I mention the DRIVE-THRU?! It just keeps getting better. I highly recommend visiting Vege-Way and be sure to watch the recommended videos about the meat industry.   I'd definitely LOVE to visit this place again!",

It seemed more like a tempura batter than what you'd expect for popcorn chicken. It mostly tasted like grease unfortunately. We did love the curly fries but you can get those anywhere. We were told that they would have a new menu starting in January, so I would be willing to give it another chance in the future.",

    "text": "Part two of trying all the Vegan places in town for the daughter.   Coming here to Chef Kenny's place was an exciting event. A couple of things off the bat, \"Turn the MUSIC down.\"  And where are all the chairs and tables?  I have to review this as a fast food place, and not just a vegan place.   1. Choices - The choices are similar to any fast food place, burgers, double burgers, burger meal deals, popcorn chicken.  There were sweet potato fries and curly fries as well as milkshakes.  Really interesting was the fish taco, a beef sandwich something like a Bahn Mi and a chicken wrap! Heck, you can even buy frozen patties to bring home... That is great.   2.  If you are- having a hankering for fast food, a burger, fries and a shake, this is a great place to come and get your fix!  3.  If you are - not only a vegan, but watching what ingredients you are putting into your body, then I would caution you that this is first and foremost a fast food place.  Fried, deep fried, heinz ketchup (vegan, but with corn syrup....) and so all the ingredients are well, as normal as you can get for a vegan.  For me, i think that having fast food and being vegan, this is a great choice.  However, I would say, as a place to go and have a great meal, this would not be my first, second or third choice.  I found the music over bearing, the decor a bit trashy and really not too thoughtful, a lack of chairs and tables, I thought the service was a bit slow, the sweet potatoes way over cooked, and the curly fries were okay.  The chocolate shake was pretty good. The hamburger was very, very cheesy, and overly cheesy.  The fish tacos were pretty darn good.  I just did not feel that this was a place I will continue to eat at. However, when the vegan daughter has a need for greasy, junk food, I am gonna take her here and be proud of it. GK says check it out, just be aware like most fast food places, it is what it is.  This place was to me the equivalent of a McDonalds or Burger King and has a way to go for that In and Out type of quality, taste and ambiance.  Thanks,",

    "text": "Since opening, I came in several times & noticed that their lettuce, onion & tomato didn't seem fresh. I don't eat any kind of meat, poultry, fish or dairy so I always pay close attention to the freshness of the fruits & vegetables on my food.   The  first time I came in, they ran out of cheese  which is a good thing because they use Daiya cheese which I'm not too fond of because of the sweet aftertaste. The burger is good though despite of their lettuce, tomato & onion not being fresh. The bun reminds me of in & out buns when I use to go there back in my meat eating days. My sons like the popcorn chicken. I enjoyed the fish taco & strawberry shake.   The second time, I went to the drive thru. It was an odd process. I waited for a moment & then the speaker told me to wait & then she came on & told me to order at the window. And then...and then...and thennnnnnn.....haha   Once I ordered, she said to pull around at the side. That was different. I drove around a couple times until I found a parking space. I guess that's the procedure considering how busy it was. It's nice to see a vegan place like this poppin.   Overall the family was pleased. Grease on grease on grease. Perfect for those kind of days. When the kids want a fast food burger, this is the place. Everything I conjectured it to be. It fulfills it's purpose for a greasy, fast food drive thru joint, vegan style. I love the concept of this establishment. Can't wait to try the other things on the menu.",

The burger was really tasty too but if I had to pick, the steak sandwich wins hands down.   Both milkshakes were really good but the strawberry one was way more flavorful compared to the chocolate.  The popcorn chicken totally hit the spot. The breading is on the thicker side but doesn't overwhelm the chicken.   Monster fries were sooooooo good. Definitely not sharing those next time.   The curly fries were good but needed more seasoning, in my opinion. They were cooked really well though, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.   Everything is here is vegan but we still had to ask about cooking methods and they assured us that they do not use any animal products like lard for cooking the food.",

The Hawaiian burger and curly fries were it, apparently. I got the burger... and was profoundly disappointed.  It dripped fat and lacked flavor. Fake cheese made exactly zero contribution to it. This particular burger deserves two, not three stars, but the extra star I'm giving this establishment represents the benefit of the doubt: maybe I got the wrong item. I am willing to give this place one more try before I make up my mind. Expect an update.",

    "text": "Not that great.  It was really fun to try a vegan fast food, but honestly, the best thing we had was the milkshake. Too bad the mango was discontinued. Anyway, the burger is super average. Even grocery store burgers are better since they have some flavor and more texture. Kinda surprised the bun isn't an obvious whole grain or wheat. Overall, flavor really lacked. Kids enjoyed the fries, but they will eat those anywhere. Zucchini would be better if it was seasoned, its pretty bland, but the breading is great. Same goes for the popcorn chicken. There are enough vegan options in Vegas that we won't be back. On an upside, we loved that the staff clearly love their jobs. They were singing in the kitchen and obviously happy. That was nice to see and hear.",

    "text": "It's apparent the owner of this restaurant is a tight-fisted business man and not a real vegetarian chef or pioneer for healthy foods - as it tastes like they put the lowest quality ingredients they can acquire into their food. And I could see sitting in the dining area into the back of the kitchen some real junky, bulk-style food ingredients you might get at Food-4-Less, the cheapest stuff you can get. And the food was awful. Bland, flavorless... it was a chore to finish our order. And we tried out their other restaurant, Veggie House, and it too was more of the same. I took some non-vegetarians there to open their palates to new, delicious, meat-less foods while we were visiting in Las Vegas - but we were all sorely disappointed. And it doesn't make sense that Veggie House doesn't cook with garlic or onions (a strict Buddhist dietary code), however VegeWay did. So it begs the question: what exactly are this owner's ethics? Is he actually just trying to save money with garlic and onions at the other restaurant? It appears so. Just cheap cheap cheap.... that's what their food is. Not cheap in price - but cheap in quality, taste, and ethics.",

My only complaint is that the menu is so limited and the service a bit slow; we were there at 7:00 pm, the only customers in the store, and it took ten minutes to get our food. Still, I will go back and I highly recommend Vege-Way to anyone wanting a delicious burger.",

I think the coleslaw they have here is pretty fresh and had a good crunch to it.  I've ordered the chicken Cajun burger, that one was chewy ant the patty kept sticking to the roof of my mouth.  I'm thinking it's a tapioca based party. The veggie burger however, was pretty good.  Great bite and taste.  I'm not vegetarian or Vegan-but I go here for the flavor of the food and a break from meat.   The wait of the food is long and that's because it's all made to order.  This doesn't upset me.  The owner/chef Kenny is usually here and is extremely Hospital and accommodating.  I recommend this place even to the meatiest of eaters.  Update 2/23/18 Dear chef Kenny,  Your worker Athena seemed pretentious and rude today. When asked about nutrition facts about the food, she replied,\"I have no idea,\" then she gave me a box of food without bagging it and just looked at me. I had to ask for a bag and she seemed to be annoyed. I don't even want to come back because of the way she was.  Can you please tell your workers to be more considerate ?",

Now, this is in no way a gourmet burger- it's a quick and dirty fast food burger. In vegan form. And it's pretty glorious. I think even a meat eater could appreciate it. The look of the double vegan burger reminded me of an in-n-out burger. The patties are more on the mushier side, and I know many people who prefer a firmer patty. Vegan cheese is well melted and makes the burger gooey/sticky, which I kinda really enjoy. I did have to finish it with a fork... It's the closest thing I've found yet to a fast food burger, so I'm happy with it. I haven't had the chance to try other menu items besides the fish tacos, which are refreshing with their mango salsa. Way to go chef Kenny! Will have to try the popcorn \"chicken\" on my next visit :-)",

I did not find anything like that but I did find a picture of a bug that somebody posted a month ago! Yuck having been that I already ordered my food and I have been out of the country numerous times and who knows what I have eight but still it's not cool. I also read that somebody had a burger that smelled horrible and did not make them want to eat it at all so I decided to try the beef sandwich it was just OK it was a little bit dry the fries were bomb though and so was the shake. I looked in my food and didn't see any bug in there I did let the girl know about the yelp review to and she said that she had no idea and was going to let her manager know... Also when I went inside to pick up my food I noticed I was the only one in line and I noticed that the floor was really dirty like they could sweep it.... I mean in my opinion the cashier could be sweeping it in his downtime also the windows were really dirty the door to the entrance also the grills on the outside looked kind a like they needed to be wiped down I don't know these kinds of things help to not get bugs. Just saying. Will I be returning I don't think so.",

Now alot of people have compared this establishment to IN & OUT Burger and the presentation is indeed very similar. I was a little bit disappointed with the ambiance of the place because it looked like more of a Thai or Asian establishment. Now with that being said I do realize the owner of the location is Asian and in fact there is a sign posted in the establishment advising people to go to \"Veggie House\" which I assume is owned by the same family.   I HIGHLY recommend the Double Double Burger.....Curly Fries.....and Drink for just under 10 bucks.....it is the best deal in the establishment in my opinion. We found out they are now serving Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches......Chicken Burgers with Ranch and Fish Sandwiches as well.....all VEGAN of course. My wife upgraded her meal for $2.50 more so she could try the Strawberry Milkshake...... I tried some of hers and it was just \"OKAY\". Be advised they use SOY and Almond Milk to make their Milkshakes so if you don't drink either of those milks then I wouldn't purchase the shakes.  All in all the service was great.....the food was indeed Delicious and we were literally IN and OUT (get it.....LOL) in about 30 minutes. While not in a very populated area it is still worth the trip to try out these wonderful Burgers and Fries.....Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!",

Clean establishment, friendly staff and it has a drive thru! I've been to VegeWay five times- I've made more use of the driverthru:)   VegeWay's fried zucchini and the Vegan milkshake are my favorites. That milkshake is yummy! I've built a vegan burger and it was tasty! I mean the mock meat actually tasted really good.   I'm not a chicken person, so as for the VegeWay's orange and popcorn dishes I can't honestly tell you.  However! I've seen those plates pass my by and thought hmm- next time. I wish the menu was a bit more extensive, perhaps a Vegan infused menu?",

The place was busy! We went around 630 P.M. And it made me so happy to see it popping... We ordered two meals... Mine, I did protein style (no bun) no cheese and sauce on the side and the sweet potato fries. My friend ordered the vegan cheese burger, regular fries, and a mango milk shake. The food didn't take to long to come out... We waited maybe ten min total. It wasn't very expensive either... It was around $20.00.   My food was awesome. The burger was excellent... Grilled perfectly. The Fries were great... Nothing was greasy at all... It was hard to tell this was fast food... And I didn't feel guilty eating it.   My friend enjoyed his burger. He did not care for the vegan cheese and said next time he would order a double with no cheese. He really liked his fries as well... The mango milk shake was sweeter than he preferred but he said the chocolate and vanilla are his next tries... He was impressed and from a non vegan in and out veteran... That says a lot. I am really excited for the new location that is opening closer to my house! Thank you chef Kenny!!!",

Menu also includes vegan fish tacos and vegetarian popcorn chicken.   I tried the single party burger. Guac is free!!  Comes with the burger. However, it tastes like store bought Guac which I don't like instead of fresh made Guac. I think next time I'll go without it. We also got the curly fries, popcorn chicken and a mango milkshake. The mango milkshake is interesting.. It sort of tasted like a mango slushee in boba stores. The curly fries were good. Not as addicting like jack in the box ones but I'm sure these are 100x more healthy.   My fave was the popcorn chicken. It's just fried gluten but it was very satisfying. Had a nice texture and crispness to it. The burger was good. It didn't exactly taste like in and out but the essence was there. The patty is very crispy and deep fried and does have a bite to it. After the meal I was thoroughly full and didn't miss meat!",

My 17yo meat-eating, In-N-Out loving son just declared, with a surprised look on his face, that it was \"better than a regular burger\" and demanded that I stop what I was doing and take a bite of mine immediately.   The vanilla milkshake is also something I will definitely order again. Too bad they sold out of chocolate and strawberry before I could get there tonight, but am so glad to see them so busy.  Can't wait to try everything else. I still have a 'vegan beef sandwich' (looks like a banh mi to me) waiting for me in the kitchen, but I had to sit down right away to send them some love by writing this review after trying that incredibly delicious burger :D",

I am a mere 2 minutes from this plant-based fast food joint (2.) the burger itself has several different textures which gives it a good mouth feel (3.) POPCORN CHICKEN AND MILKSHAKES (4.) three different types of fries and I honestly enjoy them all  Keep in mind that vegan fast food is not meant to be healthy, it is still fast food. But it would definitely be a healthier option in comparison to regular fast food. VegeWay allows anyone to have the fast food experience (greasy, fatty, salty, sweet, and you drive right through) without compromising plant based choices.   It's only been a few months and they will already be opening a second location which just goes to show that there's a market for vegan fast food. Thumbs up to Chef Kenny for making it happen right here in Vegas!",

We got their double vegan burgers with curly fries and a side of popcorn chicken. We waited a while for our food. We didn't realize our order was already ready because the girl putting together our orders did not call out the right number. The popcorn chicken looked better in the picture than it tasted, but their vegan burgers were good. The vegan patty is probably one of the best ones we have had in town, since most restaurants use the boca burger, which I hate. They sell their vegan burgers frozen, so we will plan on going back there to buy some and make our own burgers at home! I would like to go back there again to try the tacos, salad, and wrap. I gave them 4 stars because they were disorganized and understaffed, given that they should have ramped up for the grand opening. Also, it bothered me that the girl preparing the orders did not have her hair up.",

I got the beef sandwich and i cannot emphasize how tasty it was! It was actually better than a regular natural beef banh mi! All \"meat\" is soy! It was so good. I cannot wait to come back tomorrow to try their cheeseburger! So if you're new to the \"no meat\" life and you miss the meaty burgers and sandwiches, go here! It's not expensive, it's not healthy, & it's not meat, but if you want to eat something similar to In n Out or Banh Mi, go here! Plus their vegan sauces were rich in flavor!",

The famous In-N-Out burger is expertly replicated into an animal/earth friendly delight at Vege Way. From what I remember about In-N-Out, this version actually tastes better (perhaps that's owing to the fact that it is cruelty free). Cheese was some of the closest plant based version of a good ol' slab of greasy American cheese that I've ever tasted.   Just a few critiques of the place: part of what tops off the In-N-Out experience was the fries. While tasty, the fries at Vege Way are not close to the original. It would be nice if the fries were replicated as well. Also, a vegan offering similar to In-N-Out's animal style dressing would be a welcome option. Additionally service was very slow and many orders seemed to be messed up, but I'm chocking that up to them having been open 2 days when I was there.  All in all, I will definitely be returning many times, I'm sure.",

    "text": "My family has been customers of this restaurant and chef Kenny's other restaurants for quite some time and while we have had several issues with our orders being made incorrectly. I have NEVER had a problem worth complaining over our experience today was the WORST dining experience I have had in years. We often have issues with our order here we typically over look it. Today we had an issue and when I called to tell them so that my order would be remade before I got back to the store the manager told me I LEFT the burger instead of I'm sorry we didn't put your order in your bag. Once I arrived she actually tried to give me back the cold food I returned instead of offering to remake all of it since I had to drive all the way back. So I suggested that they just give me my money back. She said that's not a good reason to give you your money back. In shock that she would even speak to me like that I explained that I just took 30 minutes of my time bringing the food back and I don't understand why they wouldn't just remake the entire order once now all of my food was cold. Instead she offers me just the burger that was missing. After saying she diners understand why I would want a \"fucking\" refund loudly in front of other customers and slamming the bag in the trash. She proceeds to actually complain and talk negatively about me as I stand there waiting for my food to be remade with my 12 year old standing there. Needless to say I won't be coming back but I will be contacting the owner of the this restaurant because another customer who witnessed this behavior actually left do to it.",

They are delicious my non vegan husband eat them like they are regulars burgers no complains and they begin adding new items to the menu now they have orange chicken OMG latterly taste like chicken definitely kills the craving of real chicken in the wraps are really good, the fish tacos too, the only thing I never taste are the shakes but I hear they're really good . So far I can assure you, you will find something to eat here.  it doesn't matter if you vegan or not don't be scare give it a try.",

I got the popcorn chicken with sweet potato fries and a chocolate milkshake and I give it a 5/5. The only reason I'm giving Vegehouse 4/5 stars is because my girlfriend got a cheeseburger and we're really not fans of the Daya American Cheese. It has a very sweet aftertaste. It would be amazing if VegeWay found an alternative cheese. Other than that, this place is so cute, has great food and kind service. It's fast food but doesn't have the grimy feel that Burger King and those places have.  Even if you're not vegan/vegetarian, check it out! I'm so happy vegan is spreading across Vegas!",

I give this place 4/5 stars because they use Daiya cheeze for their burgers. I'm a True fan of Follow Your Heart, which tastes so amazing! Hopefully they switch because the Daiya overpowers the burger. I ordered the burger the following week w/o the cheeze and it was better.   My two absolute favorites are the strawberry shake (mmm) and the popcorn chick'n (mmm-mmm-mmm!). Come get yours!  P.S. Don't sleep on that Cajun ketchup though. The hit!",

Even the bun was burnt. There were these  long tough pieces of what appeared to be some type of stem throughout the burger. Highly disappointed is what I am. I doubt I will ever return to this restaurant. This was a complete waste of time and money.",

I love this place for the food and that's what keeps me coming back. There have been numerous times I've sat in the drive-thru for 20+ minutes, which isn't too bad because whatever, sometimes food just takes a while to make and I get it. But one occasion (a couple months back) one of the workers completely forgot I was there in the drive-thru despite having taken my payment. He comes back 20 min later and asks me what I'm waiting for with a confused look on his face. I was utterly dumbfounded because my payment was taken yet there was no food being prepared for me. So I had to wait another 10 min or so for them to finally catch up. I don't understand how you just forget about someone in the drive-thru. Another dumb experience here is that the one of the workers charged me for a fountain drink despite having purchased the meal combo, which surprise-surprise already includes a fountain drink. But the reason I'm writing this review is for my experience that happened just now. I ordered an entire 45 minutes beforehand for take-out. I get to the restaurant, all positive that nothing could go wrong because I did everything in advance. Once I walk up to the cashier, I tell her I'm here for a pick-up and she looks all confused, goes to the kitchen looking for what I ordered. Right then and there I knew they fucked up yet again. She tells me that they never received an order but I paid through a goddamn app. So you take my money but claim to not have gotten the order? Okay. Definitely not doing business here at this point. If you want good, accurate, and speedy service, I recommend Veggy Street on Fort Apache and their food is the real deal. This place is ridiculous and don't waste your TIME and money here.",

I even made it tonight at 8:50 and they still took my order even though it was going to run them past closing time! I could go on and on but just try it!",

SADLY I noticed the lately the food here has changed. From crispy delicious orange chicken to dry and spongy flavourless blah. Something has changed dramatically from the cheese to the burgers.  Its not just a one time thing as well because I go here a lot.   Maybe change in recipe?  My ratings before what has changed:  Food 5/5 amazing! Customer Service 5/5 perfect!  Now sadly :(  Food 2/5 stomach ache  Customer Service 5/5 perfect!  Hopefully things will change.",

The burger was perfectly sloppy, the curly fries crispy and the fountain Diet Coke (something else I never consume) was refreshing. The menu is limited, but I didn't want anything but a burger and fries so no complaints from me. I will likely visit again before our trip is over.",

It exceeded my expectations of a vegan burger by so much!  So when she ordered again I decided to get the vegan beef sandwich, which is supposed to be similar to a banh mi.  When I took a bite I could not believe how delicious is was!  It had the texture of beef, the flavor was on point, & I felt good eating it!   My boyfriend was starting to get tired of eating vegan so I suggested this place & so we ordered dinner here and got the burger, beef sandwich, popcorn chicken, & orange chicken.  To his surprise he couldn't believe it was vegan either!    Obviously there's some slight difference to the taste compared to meat BUT this place has a really good alternative",

    "text": "Craving burgers much? I do, but visits to Vegeway minimizes the guilt of diet high in cholesterol while satisfying that craving that is bovine friendly. Even that pair of bovines advocating \"Eat Mor Chikin\" 20 years ago would be happy about everything served at Vegeway.  So it has been a few months since my last visit to Vegeway, it was cold and slightly breezy (perfect weather for everything except passing the time watching all the hunnies show off what they've been training off-season for) and I dropped in after a Yelp gathering for their limited time holiday inspired milkshake: Peppermint Oreo.  To be honest, it was not what I envisioned but it tasted very good and didn't even last 10 minutes on the drive home.  Fast forward to the dreaded summer heat of early June, I am already not a fan and it is only in the 90s around 11am. I was running some errands, got a little lost driving around and decided to just grab something at Vegeway for brunch, since I was only a mile or two away.  As I was about to walk in, a customer was just coming out and said \"they are not opened.\" I was not expecting that, and although I believed him I still opted to go inside and ask when they are going to be open. Which turned out to be 11am, instead of 10:30am that is posted on Yelp (I have since sent a business update request to YELP HQ), so I just waited the 15 minutes inside and enjoy their AC and check their menu for what I would order later.  I was going to get two Double Vegan Burgers, until I saw the new item being promoted: Hawaiian Cheese Burger. So I order one of each of these burgers, a Chocolate and Vanilla Vegan Milkshake and added Vegan Popcorn Chicken (so I can charge it to my CC, because it would be super embarrassing and a hassle not being able to pay the $2 and change I still owe in cash after using up $14 in Groupon credit.  The Chocolate and Vanilla Milkshake is an easy custom order for them to whip up, and it felt extra refreshing sipping it in the dry heat. Most people probably wouldn't even notice that it is vegan, but it is.  The Hawaiian Cheeseburger comes with a ring shaped pineapple from the can, which was good. But had that pineapple been fresh or just grill it to caramelized the natural sugar inside, it would have made that burger even better.  The Double Vegan Cheeseburger was pretty substantial. Eating it Zi noticed stuff sticking to the roof of my mouth more than when I am having a regular burger, but overall it is enjoyable and I was quickly getting full.  The Popcorn Chicken was decent. The batter reminds me of the ones coating the Sweet and Sour Pork at local Chinese takeouts, which is thicker than I 'd prefer, but not horrible. The dipping sauce that it was served with, I was not a fan of, so I ate most of it at home with the sweet chili sauce often served with Thai BBQ chicken. It was good eating it that way.  Overall, it is a good healthier alternative to just eating meat all the time, and my wait was nearly non-existent and the nice friendly service just made the entire getting-lost-and-that's-how-a-nice-guy-like-me-ended-up-at-a-place-like-this kind of day that much more pleasant. Or the Vegan deity in the sky pulled some cosmic strings and steered me in the door. Either way it was a charming experience and no chikin or cows were hurt to make my visit possible.  Vegeway - ,",

The patties were a little softer than other vegan burgers I've had but super tasty. The fried zucchini had a light tempura batter and were just as good. They came with a dill creamy sauce that reminded me of tzatziki or maybe it was actually called that. They also had their version of Big Mac sauce. Man those sauces just threw my meal over the top. Prices were good and I couldn't even finish. I was so stuffed that I took leftovers to work and finished them a little later cuz I couldn't stay away. Highly recommend and will be back.",

Everything on their menu is vegetarian friendly and they have a handful of options like burgers, fries or a banh mi sandwich. Think of it almost like McDonald's but without the meat.  This most recent visit I had the cheeseburger with curly fries. I really enjoyed the burger after adding a bit of ketchup and must say it's the closest thing I've had to that real burger taste since going pescatarian. I really enjoyed the curly fries too, they tasted just like Arby's. It is definitely greasy food though so don't think of it as being healthy by any means.   Overall I'd come back again if I was ever in the area. A+ for being vegetarian friendly and having a drive thru. I only wish there was a location closer to my side of town.",

On the first trip shortly after they very first opened I explain to them that I needed something without soy several employees assured me what I ordered was soy free... Long story short it was not! Second visit here... No cars in front of me and the wait for a burger, fries and milk shake was so long my poor toddler literally Peed his pants in the car. After giving my food and making it clear that I was ready to go on my way I asked what about the milkshake? The kid at the drive-through with absolutely no personality or people skills said oh they're still making it close the window and took his sweet time walking over to what I could clearly see was him in fact making the milkshake. (This was after stopping and chatting for a bit with another employee). Several minutes later....Which even after over 10 minutes of waiting on my food hadn't even been started yet but \"they were making it \". Hey I think I'll try the other location... This place needs to seriously step up who it hires! If you want to appeal to vegans, that means people who care about the planet. People. Animals. And what's in their food...please HIRE BETTER STAFF!",

Full of Veggie House brown rice, gooey chkn, tons of sundried tomatoes, wilty lettuce....just not good.  The burger patty is ok, but todays was dry like a hockey puck. The first time I tried one it had a melted plastic taste because of the Daiya, two more times I minus the cheese and onion and realize it just does not taste like a burger, why? no pickles. This place does not believe in pickles.  The fysh taco is good but wow its soggy and just a mess.   The first time I tried, it had a great taste, guess I was super hungry.  Chkn bites are super gross and doughy and the \"ranch\" tastes like oily old dill.  Milkshakes are bomb but hey the ice cream is from Perfect Scoop.   I did order curly fries and they taste exactly like the ones from Arby's I ate 20 years ago. Not a reason to come back.    Just not a fan. Centennial same experience.

It's not gourmet, it's not fancy, but it's perfect.   I came by here after hiking at Red Rock Canyon with my dog. It's hard enough finding dog-friendly restaurants, let alone vegan dog-friendly restaurants, and I was so hungry. To have a drive-thru option at a vegan fast food restaurant was all I could dream of and more!  I opted for the burger meal, with curly fries and a chocolate shake. The fries were some of the best I've ever had. The burger patty seemed to be made out of beans and rice, but it was still toothsome and meaty. With all of the accoutrements, it was a damn fine burger. The chocolate shake was a little icy, but still perfectly reminiscent of the fast food shakes I had growing up. Not fancy, not high quality, but still just what you want. I actually appreciated that it wasn't too rich, so I could fully enjoy my feast.   I want so badly for Veggie Grill to open up some drive-thru locations in LA, I think it'd be a game changer. Vegeway is proof that it can work and it can be awesome.",

However my meat-loving husband wanted to try this place.. my hero   Pros: 1) Simple menu but a lot of different options  2) Overall the food was delicious...      - the burgers had a little smoky taste to them :)      - the fried zuchini breading wasn't too heavy or greasy...not too much flavor though.      - curly fries were fantastic! 3) Food was made quickly but not too fast! Everything tasted very fresh.  4) Price was on point. For 2 burgers, fried zuchini and curly fries it was $17.04. Definitely more than enough food for the two of us.   Cons: 1) An ingrediant list for their patties would be nice...just to know they arent completely processed.",

The burgers were everything we hoped for, milkshake was great (though they were out of chocolate so it was subbed for vanilla), and the popcorn chicken with ranch was so addicting. So disappointed we were only able to eat here once on our trip but we certainly look forward to being back!",

    "text": "COOOOOL. Plant-based fast food! WE'RE TOTES IN THE FUTURE YAWL  Ordered the bahn mi (beef sandwich) and sweet potato fries. So happy to finally have bahn mi!! Since I gave up eating meat nearly 3 yrs ago, I've been opting for veggie bahn mi. This beef-like substitute is a blessing to my life.  Bahn mi: served in a hotdog-like white bun that broke apart as I picked it up. Wish they served authentic Vietnamese style like a baguette (PUH-LEEEEASE with a cherry on top honor this suggestion). Other than that, taste mirrored that of an actual bahn mi. Almost creepy and too-good-to-be True.  Sweet potato fries: clean!!! What I mean by this is NOT oily and NOT salty. Seriously, my fingers were spotless after eating them.  I can see myself becoming a regular here as I love veggie restaurants and eating clean. If you are someone who is accustomed to a lot of sodium and oil to flavor your food, you will not enjoy this restaurant. Anyone looking for a cheat meal with cheap prices and whole, nourishing ingredients will love VegeWay.",

I was very excited about my first visit since one of my vegan friends has been talking about it for months.  The menu is pretty small which was expected since there aren't that many options for vegans to begin with.  I ended up ordering a double burger (2/5) with monster fries (5/5). The price was fair ($11.34 for both items). The fries were absolutely delicious. They have a sauce that's similar to 1000 island dressing that took the cake for this one. The burger was just okay. The bun had no taste to it.  We also had a side of ranch dressing which was plain and watery.",

    "text": "Yes it is vegan... So let's get that out of the way....:)  Service was OK... The staff were extremely friendly which would've been a 5 but the speed of the food coming out was a little on the slow side. So yes it is like fast food in the way that your order but the food definitely did not come out fast so minus 1 star. And for the timing as well... My burger came out first and it sat there for a few minutes while everything else on my order was getting fried. Timing was off since everything was hot but my burger was a tad bit cold. :( (3/5)  Ambiance was OK... It was small and the decor changed little from when this was another sandwich shop.... But it was clean just not very welcoming imho... And it was a tad bit cold in there. But the most important thing was that it was clean and that they had a person cleaning and changing out the trash can...4/5  Food was decent. I think veggie house is definitely 5 star... Vege Way not so much. I got their burger and it was decent. But the \"meat\" was not the best... It was a tad bit on the mushy side but the flavor was very good. Very earthy.... But I wished that they had put more of a sear on it so that it would've had a better texture. (2.5/5)  Curly fries were curly fries (5/5). Fried zucchini was decent. BUT the batter never stuck to the zucchini and it just fell off. It was cool that it was more of a tempura batter then breading but the oil was too cold because it was very very very greasy!!! Flavor was good but it was drenched in oil (2.5/5). The popcorn chicken on the other hand was fantastic! (5/5) perfectly crunchy and not too greasy either. And just like the zucchini this was more a tempura style batter... The texture of the chicken was perfect as was the batter. Very crunchy.  The ranch was also delicious for being vegan. It didn't taste like ranch to me but it had a great flavor. And I enjoyed dipping the popcorn chicken and the fried zucchini in it. (5/5)  Am I vegan...No. was this place as amazing as veggie house on spring mountain ... Sadly no... But was it decent? Yes it was. Will I be back. Most likely. The chicken was good and I really liked the batter. There are also other items on the menu that I would like to try.",

Pretty slow on a wednesday around 6pm. I enjoyed the Spanish rock punkish music while eating my burger and fries. If youre not a fan of pineapple dont get the Hawaiian burger. The caramelised onions and pineapple together wasn't so sweet but enough juice to really savor this burger. The mango shake was lighter than expected and refreshing. I also enjoyed the sauce that came in the squeeze bottle to go with my curly fries. If you dont have time to sit inside they do have a drive thru which is a plus for a vegan restaurant.",

It didn't have any texture, it mostly tasted like beans and fell apart. The cheese, not great. It had that sticky texture that some vegan cheese has in your mouth. I was not a fan. The fries were good. I thought I'd try the milkshake that everyone raved about. It tasted like a combination of ice and those protein vanilla workout shakes you get.

I had a single burger I also had the popcorn chicken fried zucchini curly fries and regular fries LOL. I really wanted to try everything! All satisfied my taste buds. The burger was delicious the cheese on the burger actually was very tasty it tasted pretty close to the in and out burger. Fries were crisp and tender inside. Fried zucchini the tempura they put on it I don't know how they do but it was incredible. Popcorn chicken delicious nice texture and flavor and the sauce was amazing. My friend had a salad it looked incredible I took a picture. I did not taste it so all I know is she said she loved it. If you just became vegan or a long time vegan I would imagine this place satisfies the need for fast food. The only request and I only dream is that they build one in the north part of town so it is closer to me. Thank you Chef Kenny for creating this beautiful establishment!",

    "text": "When this place first opened it was the BEST. The idea of vegan fast food was new and amazing and you could tell the owner really cared about serving tasty vegan food. The burgers were juicy and the fries were crunchy. Now the fries taste like McDonald's fries and the patties are hard like a rock most times. They charge 25 cents for a tiny dipping sauce that they don't even fill to the top (they didn't used to charge) but I guess they've gotten greedy and changed the ingredients to the cheapest possible and absolutely must charge per sauce. What I'm saying is this placed USED to be the shit when the owner didn't care more for profit than quality. You want good vegan food? Go to violettes vegan on Durango and desert inn. Get their tempeh bacon burger and fries or anything else on the menu. if you're new to vegan food or trying to open the mind of a carnivore to a vegan diet.... do NOT GO HERE it will scare you away and I promise not all vegan tastes this shitty. much love.",

And it was just not good. It wasn't even that the patty wasn't convincing (which it wasn't), it just overall wasn't good in terms of taste, texture, and appeal. Even their curly fries didn't match up to similar fast food chains that their trying to emulate, and neither their sauces. The house made ketchup, v-mac sauce, and chipotle were weak or tasteless. Everything I tried here was just undoubtedly inferior to their non-vegan counterparts.   I just think this place is trying too hard to be something it's not. I know that's the concept, but the only way I can imagine someone enjoying the food here are vegans who've completely forgotten the taste and texture of meat, cheese, and butter. And it's not because this place is vegan, because this is coming from someone who hasn't eaten meat in almost 3 years and enjoys vegan food. It's just because its just not good in terms of food in general. Plus one star for the friendly service, minus three for one of the worst veggie burgers and, flat out, worst meals I've had in a while. This place doesn't do vegan food justice.",

    "text": "So Vege-way opened just after I turned full on veganesque.  I'm not hardcore vegan, but it has been neigh unto 2 years I have been meat free.  At that time this place was wicked good.  And, it became my go to \"fast food\" place to hit when I felt like a burger and not cooking.  So I've eaten Vege-Way no less than 20 times.  Recently, not sure if the recipe changed, but the \"burger\" is different.   Here's a few more observations over the 20 times I've visited.  First, I pretty much always hit the drive through and my conversations with the person over the speaker system go like this, I kid you not:  hey what can we get for you?  I'll have 2 cheeseburgers 1 order of French fries and 1 order of curly fries. Ok so do you want sauce with your chicken bites and zucchini? Um no. 2 cheeseburgers 1 order of fries and 1 curly fries.  Ok so I have a wrap, a double burger, you want cheese? And 2 fries.  Um no, I want 2 cheeseburgers 1 French fry and 1 curly fry.  Oh sorry do you want cheese?  On my cheeseburgers?  Yes I want cheese on my cheeseburgers, please.  Ok so I have 2 burgers with cheese and 2 fries.  Hmmm no. 2 cheeseburgers and 1 fry and 1 curly fry.  Oh ok got it.  Frustrating to say the least.  Second, when I first started going here the fries were great! And you got a decent portion for the $2.75 they cost. The last 4 times, the fries have been different cuts, different styles and different quantities. I got home and found I only had 20 fries in my order, yes I counted and I didn't eat them on the way home.  Third I've never seen the same person working there, ever.  And the drive through conversation is virtually the same each visit and the quantity and quality is different as well.  Hmmm.  Because of the fry issue I actually stopped ordering fries here and will stop somewhere else for fries which, takes all the air out of the sails of \"fast convenient\" food, when you have to hit 2 places.  Also makes me have to choose which item I wanna eat cold.  Another gripe, is cost.  Eating out is a luxury, but when you're eating fast food and never leave a place for under $20 for two and have to hit a second place to get sides and have to go through the painful drive through, you gotta ask, how convenient is it and why am I still gong and why am I spending the same for a burger and fries as say a nice sit down place with linen napkins?   Well I do love the place and love the concept even though I have to work to eat here.    Vege-Way compares itself to In-N-out. By design- In-N-Out  for vegans!  Here's what the difference is and what In-N-Out does right that Vege-Way does not.   In-N-Out limited menu and secret menu. They limit what they produce so it's consistent and good every time, and the secret menu is genius.  Maybe there's a secret Vege-Way menu and why the drive through person never understands what I order.  In-N-Out is fast and convenient locations all over and you don't have to hit a second place unless someone in your crew wants chicken or something. The fries are always the same, always. And they are over flowing from the paper tub and I've never gotten cold ones, not ever in like 20 years of going there.  It is also cheap.  I mean the price has been virtually the same for that 20 years.  For less than $10 you can walk out full.  Vege-Way is no In-N-Out replacement, it is good if not inconsistent, and I love that I can get vegan eats on the go but some of the issues need to be ironed out.",

My meat eating friend tried the burger and said it was sweet most likely the non dairy cheese but again the perspective will be different because over time we know as Plant Eaters our taste buds have changed.  I loved it and I will be back!",

I hear the chicken sandwiches are great but I've never been a chicken fan so I doubt I'd like fake chicken. But man.... the staff leave las so much be desired. I am not looking to be entertained but a smile and some sort of personality would be a plus. No smiles, no emotion, no help when asking a question from cashier. Then in the kitchen was 2-3 employees Staring at a screen watching loud music videos. Just kinda odd....   nothing about my most recent visit was inviting and I kinda wish I didn't leave a tip now.",

    "text": "Veggie House is my go-to vegan restaurant in Las Vegas, so I was ecstatic when I found out Chef Kenny was opening up a plant based drive-thru burger place. A vegan food drive-thru spot? Twenty something years I've been waiting for this moment. I got off work early and knew today was the day. The whole way over I was giddy with anticipation, I couldn't get there fast enough.        The hardest part of hitting up a new spot is what to order. What if what you order sucks?Do you come back again in hopes the next thing you order won't? So I always get like three things(which is always way to much food) but my feeling is it's worth it to go a little nuts the first go because if all three things suck, chances are, I'm not coming back. I went through the drive thru which could have been a little faster, but it's quality food so it was worth it, and the employees were super friendly.  My order: Single Veggie Burger: I really wanted to love this, but I'm not a fan of daiya cheese(the whole boogery/gritty consistency, lack of flavor/pungent tapioca flavor isn't my thing). The patty itself was delicious though, so next time ill opt for it w/o cheese. Now for the good part...the Vegan Beef Sandwich. This is up there with one of the best sandwiches I have ever consumed. A delicious buttered bun (caramelized just on the edges so the bun still hold the chewiness without overdoing it), amazing veggie Beef, shredded carrot/daikon, jalapeno, Mayo and cilantro. I can't say enough good things about it. For years any time I would get a Vietnamese sandwich I'd order it w/ tofu, but the flavor and texture was never there. The Veggie Beef in this things is incredible. The texture and marinade are spot on. It's like the sandwich I've always dreamed about. My only complaint, next time I need to bring my bottle of hoisin sauce. Soo good on Vietnamese sandwiches.      Fried zucchini was delicious. Not too greasy and the ranch was good.      Vegeway is definitely going to be seeing more of me. Next time I want to try the veggie chicken wrap, milkshakes, tacos, etc,etc, etc. Eventually I'll make it through the whole menu. Thank you Chef Kenny for bringing such delicious food to Las Vegas, and especially one with a drive thru, for those nights when I'm craving that sandwich and don't feel like getting all dolled up.",

Requested a refund and the manager said she couldn't so I requested my matter be escalated to her supervisor. A phone conversation took place between the two and the conclusion was the same. What pissed me off was the young girl in the drive thru who talked shit about me to the manager; I allowed her a pass considering she was just a child to me. Luckily the manager came back and apologized, offered to recook my chicken wrap and add additional seasonings however I was concerned it would include a \"special sauce\". Kudos to the manager Ness who tried to salvage my experience (I bet she's the only reason this place is still in business) however I will NOT be visiting this resturant again and I'll be sure to tell all my vegan friends about this experience. Customer service is hideous and Kenny (the owner) should invest into some customer recovery training for his younger staff members. And to the young lady in the drive thru....... adjust your attitude because it's just as bad as the 1st chicken wrap.",

Their menu is an interesting selection of in-n-out type burgers, as well as orange chicken, curly fries and salads. I got the single burger with monster fries and my fiance got a double burger with curly fries. My burger was good but my fiance and I both decided that the patty was very plain. It didn't taste seasoned or anything, but that's not to say it was bad. The monster fries were definitely too much for me. The vegan cheese didn't really melt and I could see the oil residue sitting at the bottom of the container. I stopped about halfway through because the fries were just drenched in oil.  We will be back just because it is close and I want to give them another shot on their other items. I know they've only been open for a year but they have potential! I wish I could give them a 3.5, but unfortunately Yelp doesn't let me.",

    "text": "I hate to give this place such few stars but this experience left me confused and disappointed.   For starters I went to the drive through, with one car ordering ahead of me and another waiting at the window for their order.  I ordered the burger meal with curly fries and a vanilla milkshake and the total was $12.88.  It took 6 minutes from the time I drove up to the window to place the order over the speaker.   The girl in the car behind me got out and asked me if this was normal waiting time for this restaurant, I'd never been here before and drove a long way to try it out based on reviews.   She then went to the car in front of me which was at the window and asked the same, only to calculate the first car had been waiting 20 minutes from the time of their order. The people at the window were acting as if it wasn't a long wait or that there was a problem. By the time I got my order in hand, it was a total of 22 minutes, if you include my wait time to order, 28, so that's not fast food drive through. There were plenty of people working inside.  The girl who took my money took 3 minutes to count out my change . The whole thing was frustrating.   As for the food, the burger was not hot, the cheese needs to be revisited, I like vegan food, this just didn't work well, it was a dry burger. The curly fries were semi warm and tasted fishy. The milkshake was great.  Chalking it up to a bad day, but customer service was substandard and the food wasn't up to par. Also the building looked dark and uninviting.  Hoping this helps the business",

The popcorn chicken's texture is good (don't expect it to taste a lot like chicken...as with the burger & any vegan substitute.)  The breading on it is a great texture, like tempura but not quite as light.    The meat sandwich is pretty good, especially the yummy fixins and sauce.  NOT actual cons but not pros... Chocolate shake is barely sweet and pretty watery but has a pretty good flavor.  More sweetness would bring out the chocolate flavor more.    The zucchini breading is tempura like, a wonderful texture, but like the chicken & burger, the ranch dressing, & much of the food here, it falls under the unfortunate and unnecessary vegan stereotype of bland or not enough flavor. There are many who make vegan taste good, this place, not so much.",

Everyone working here obviously enjoys their job, as my girlfriend and I have never dealt with a snappy employee. We're slowly becoming regulars here and we have absolutely no issues with that!

We ordered from uber eats since we had our hands full at the house. We ordered a double burger meal, curly fries, chicken wrap, a milkshake and specified on the order that we wanted ranch with the meal. When our ordered arrived, there was no drink, no fries, no ranch. We tried to call and let them know, no answer. So we had to drive over and pick up the rest of our food. They were nice about the mistake but this ruined the rest of our meal. When we got home, the burger was cold. I love Vegeway and as a vegan, I fully support their mission but guys, make sure you check to-go orders before they leave the restaurant. We paid $32 for a cold and late meal. Ugh. Im so sad, I was looking forward to this meal all week! Ps. Keep the ranch consistent, sometimes it's super runny.",

Secondly, the staff here seems far happier than the staffs at any nonvegan restaurant, go figure! Always friendly, cheerful, helpful, and genuinely passionate about the meals they serve, which brings me to the food!  Everything I've tried here has been fantastic!  Like a vegan In-n-Out with more options, I loved the animal fries!  That's right, vegan sauce and vegan cheese (not a huge fan of Daiya, but it was still great! Learning to like it), and grilled onions over french fries.  YUM!  My favorite, however, was the chicken ranch sandwich, which was exquisite!  Definitely have a weakness for ranch, so thank goodness for vegan ranch!  Another gem on the menu is the chocolate peanut butter milkshake!  Oh man, I didn't think I'd ever have a good milkshake again after going vegan, so a big THANK YOU to VegeWay for proving me wrong on that thought.  I've also tried a few other things on the menu, like their double cheeseburger and their chicken poppers, which were equally delicious.  I consider myself a big fan.  Fast food has never felt better, or tastier.  My only complaint, hence the four stars (If I could only remove a half star I would have done that) was that on one occasion that I was dining here, the TV was set to a Food Network type cooking show (not sure what show exactly, not big on watching TV), which was displaying the preparation of a steak.  I found that to be bothersome, since I was eating in a vegan establishment.  It was a bit hard to eat and maintain an appetite while watching cow flesh being cut apart and prepared :/  However, in terms of everything else, Five Stars easy!!",

Anyway, the past four times I've been here, I have been unable to eat the food I got. I'm incredibly allergic to raw tomatoes, and always make sure to ask for them to not put any. They used to be great about this, but with this new wave of hires, they're now putting tomato in every single time, no matter how much I emphasize my allergy. Since these were To go, was not able to catch this before taking it home. Ended up having a severe reaction the first time they put tomato.  Today we stopped by to grab sandwiches.. my chicken ranch was TINY, with only the patty, some super witty, almost bad lettuce, and the sauce tasted so expired I had to spit it out and could not continue eating. Never experienced this here, but now very hesitant to return, as these past 4 meals have had to go to waste",

The curly fries tasted like Arby's, good but had higher expectations. The zucchini was terrible and bland. The popcorn chicken was thrown out after one bite. I wouldn't choose this place again, very greasy (I know it's fast food) but way greasier than average in n out. Worth a try, but not anything special. Has so much potential if they learn how to use some seasoning.",

The Vegan beef sandwich or as others call it the Vegan Bahn mi sandwich is the bomb!! I'm not much of a sandwich or burger fan but this sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries and a drive thru? Yassssssss! Love that my fave cilantro salad from the Veggie House is on the menu too. Yum.  My 2nd visit is the reason why I can't give them 5 stars. I ordered the vegan cheeseburger with a side of sweet potato fries of course, and the fried zucchini. The burger was good, but I've honestly had better. I added some hot chipotle sauce to add more flavor.   I was very disappointed with the fried zucchini. It was greasy and overdone - some of the zucchini were soggy, and the batter just doesn't work. If chef could fix this and get inspired by Farmer Boy's fried zucchini   I'll definitely be back - but not for the fried zucchini.   Chef, please bring in your veggie ramen bowls here and my fave salt & pepper Tofu as a side on this menu!",

I had the single burger,  regular fries, curly fries and a vanilla shake. I preferred the regular fries, but I am not really a big fan of curly fries so I gave them to my husband.  I just wanted to try them because of the reviews.  He liked them, but he is not vegan YET.  The shake was very good, but I couldn't finish it because it was too much food.  The burger reminded me of an In N Out burger that I ate before becoming vegan.  I have had better vegan burgers at vegan fast food restaurants in California and in Arizona, but I was pleased to find a quick, inexpensive vegan burger while visiting Las Vegas.",

While the young lady behind the register was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable it wasn't enough to save this experience.  Atmosphere: Uncomfortable. The 3 employees in the open kitchen were blasting some super explicit music, audible to the entire restaurant. I'm no square but it was SO inappropriate. I shot a side eye and the gent at the line reached up and turned it to something else, but as soon as we sat down he turned it back.   It's a very small dining area (totally ok with that) but we tried 3 tiny tables and they were all wobbly.  It just wasn't welcoming or comfortable at all.  Food: Pass. The burger patties were mush with an odd unidentifiable flavor. Iced tea was watered down and tasted like it had been brewed a few days before. The fries were good, but nothing we can't get anywhere else.   We really wanted this to blow our minds and it did, but only because we couldn't believe how bad it was. I'm giving 2  because it's a great idea, just very poorly executed.",

Today however, was different.   I ordered in the drive thru for just a burger and curly fries. I said my order twice. I come up to the window, paid, didn't bother for a receipt, got my food and went home (which is like 5 minutes away). I take out my order and the fries were regular fries, even though I said curly. I shrugged it off. Then the bottom of my burger was cold. Not the middle, but the bun on the bottom. It had grill marks, but it was cold. Like they grilled it in the morning and put it in the fridge or something. Then, my cheese wasn't melted all the way through. Really disappointing.   I called, after reading some reviews on here, to talk to the manager because I really liked this place. Girl who answered puts me on hold, then comes back to say the manager won't be in till 2:30. I asked for the manager's name and she said Claudia. I asked for the last name and she didn't know. Hmm... Don't know if she's being shady, but she said she'll ask. So she comes back on the phone and says Gonzalez. So I'll be calling back at 2:30 to speak to Claudia Gonzalez who I hope is the manager.",

    "text": "Vegan cheap fast food at it's finest!  Though this spot is a bit far from me, I was able to try it conveniently through a Yelp pickup order the other day.   The prices astonished me, (everything was less than $5) so I ended up ordering a bunch of food for later too.   I tried: - curly fries - popcorn chicken - buffalo chicken burger - vegan beef sandwich (banh mi spinoff)  I really liked the popcorn chicken! It was perfectly crunchy and fresh. The buffalo chicken burger had most of its sauce concentrated in the middle, so the majority of it was not recognizable as 'buffalo' style.  The vegan beef sandwich was solid, but would have been better with crunchier bread - like those usually made with banh mi. This bread was soft and crumbly; it tasted cheaper than its price.  The curly fries were pretty good.  I'd be back again, but it would help if there was a location closer to my house in the Southwest.",

This burger patty is a bit soft, but very flavorful and with an interestingly chewy texture that you can definitely sink your teeth into.   Once you add it all together in your mouth with the lettuce, tomato, bun, sauce, and fries, this will satisfy a burger craving without the meat! I'm not vegan but still transitioning, and I'm so happy this place exists. Vegan fast food! Can't wait to come back and try some of their non-burger options :)",

    "text": "UPDATE TO MY UPDATE:  It gets worse!!! So I bring up to them whats with the price of the burger and why its not up front on the menu. Bla bla whatever 'thats just how it is' Honestly if the guy who took my order gave me a heads up it would not have been a big deal, but I wasn't told that it would cost more. Again, ridiculous.  The onions were cut too thick to eat so I picked them out. The lettuce tasted poorly washed, or like theres dish soap on it, I don't know! I'm starving (after waiting in the drive thru for 20 minutes) and pregnant and have a sleeping baby in the car, so Im just taking the L and eating it. And then right towards the end of my burger, i bite plastic. I originally think its from one of my ketchup packets but it isn't, its clear ( see photo attached.) I want to go back in there and complain and get my money back but I already ate the burger and its a battle I don't feel like having. The fries are crap by the way and I only ate one. I will definitely never ever be back, and if I see Chef Kenny again I feel compelled to tell him what a disaster of an experience I had here despite trying my best to be a forgiving customer. I never get this horrible service at his other restaurant, but like I said before this one seems to be ran by teenagers who don't value their job.  Update: Came back to give them another try. $14.99 for a Beyond Burger?! It doesn't say that anywhere on the Drive thru menu. I got no warning either about the price. That's just RIDICULOUS. Changing my review to one star. Originally the guy charged me twice for a burger and then a meal, so in the confusion I didn't notice the price of the burger and wasnt warned a beyond burger with fried and a milkshake would cost $20. -------------  Old review: Food is ok but unfortunately seems to be ran by a bunch of kids. I always eat in because the drive through is always ridiculously laggy when I try it. I swear I've had to wait 40 minutes before. Last time, I ordered a hamburger. They gave me a cheeseburger. I took one bite thinking maybe I could get past it, ONE little bite and I couldn't stomach it. I told them I didn't realize the hamburger came with cheese because I ordered a hamburger not a cheeseburger. and they said they can't do anything just cause I don't like it. Well it wasn't what I ordered. So make sure you specify.",

The burgers aren't even very tasty and the veggies they put on them don't even seem that fresh. The other week I got a spicy jalapeno burger and the cheese wasn't even melted. It was like a thick slice off a hard block or something. I don't get it. Cheeseburgers should have MELTED cheese on them.  I do enjoy the Beef Banh Mi sandwich tho and the only other item I liked, they got rid of, Fish Tacos! Boo! I would rather purchase a two pack of Beyond Beef burgers and a pack of Follow your heart cheese and make a much tastier, less expensive burger at home, with MELTED cheese!",

    "text": "I have been here a few times because it's close to my house and I don't feel as guilty as I would going to another fast food joint. The service and food is usually so good! Today I came in and while I was waiting for my food I noticed the workers wearing gloves. First thought \"awesome! good for you vegeway!\" But then I watch this food handler take out his cell phone, use it and then go back to handling food while wearing the same gloves. I also watched him use the register while wearing gloves. GROSS! Management should take time out and explain the importance of food sanitation and safety to their staff.   Vegeway also changed the fries to a thinner cut fries that aren't nearly as good as the old ones. I don't know if they're cutting back on portions but the fries I received with my meal only filled about half of my basket when it used to be overflow.   I don't know if I will return based on the glove issue alone and I probably wouldn't spend the extra to get a meal if my fries are only going to be filled half way and taste generic.",

For one, the drive is very far from my house and the food wasn't necessarily worth it. The service wasn't the best; we waited quite a long time for the food, and there weren't a lot of people in the restaurant. The staff wasn't the nicest, either, BUT...I only went one time. They could've just had an off-day. The burgers were personally not my favorite, but the chicken was amazing. I also loved the fries and the vanilla shake.",

Their order speaker is old so I couldn't get my order taken properly so I had to get to the window to fix my order than I was told they didn't have a sweet potato fries but shows you can order them off the app. I'm glad I didn't place an order ahead of time because I would've been even more upset. So I ordered curly fries and my double vegan burger. I get my order after being told to wait on the side because the person behind me their order was ready before mine. And when I get my order my curly fries aren't that they're fries that are curved. Not even whole curly fries. Just a lot of nonsense and dissatisfaction with this stop at vegeway. And this is all without even trying my burger yet",

I ordered the:  Vegan Burger - Honestly really surprised me with the flavor, had some char to it and was done well, however it doesn't really fill you up and the price point for a vegetarian product is pretty high ($4.69 for a burger that doesn't fill you up).  Curly Fries - ehhhh not bad not good just fries...  Zucchini Sticks - Ok not the best but def not the worst  Milkshake - Again not the best but def not the worst...  OVerall the prce point of everything that I got would have equated to three #1's at In-N-Out...while the burger was intresting and flavorful I can not warrant a strong recomendation at that price point.

The food is delicious, which is terrific news for any and all vegetarians and vegans looking for a casual bite. That the new place has a drive thru is also good news, and rather unique for a place like this. I would recommend this burger joint to anyone, even though I myself prefer the \"beef\" sandwich to the burgers. Another stand out  here are the wonderful milkshakes. Do yourself a favor and try them.  I must say that the location itself could use some improving though. There are few tables, all of them small, and it is utterly uninviting the way they have set it up. They all but encourage you to just use the drive thru or place your order to go on account of the poor interior. It may look new but the floorplan is doing them no service here.",

Because - if you participate in any high energy activities (dancing, martial arts, yoga, meditating) after eating this crap - you will be drained energetically.  Burger patties are WAY INFERIOR to Gardein burger patties found at good quality vegan spots. Obviously those places charge more. BUT even when compared to other 'fast food vegan food', vegeway sucks.  You are literally poisoning your children when you bring them here. If you don't have time to go somewhere else, just fast. Seriously.  I tried the breaded deep fried Orange Chicken and this hit my throat really hard. Total filth.  I like the option to get my burgers wrapped in lettuce, but found the lettuce to be semi-fresh and somewhat stale. Not crisp and fresh.  Food here has the power to make you sick, especially if you have a clean system from eating a clean plant-based diet.  If you want a high quality 'fast food' vegan burger -- go to The Habit! Quality of that burger is much better and the lettuce was fresh and crisp. They also have more choices for fries at The Habit.",

I didn't understand that. Will definitely come here again though. Where is their social media? I don't think they have any yet.  FOOD: Very tasty! I had a cheeseburger meal that came with fries and a refillable drink which is perfect for the hot Vegas weather. There wasn't any ice in the fountain drinks machine but the beverages were still cold enough.   AMBIANCE: it's Kind of dated and it's very odd to me as a designer. The restaurant and menu board seems as if it should be more hip & contemporary and with the times of the vegan craze.

Burger- needs more sauce so make sure to ask for extra to make it extra saucy. The cheese was melted to perfection. They make their own patties in house and it was delicious! It didn't take bean-y or like multiple ingredients were mashed together to make a vegan patty! (They do offer beyond meat now so if you like that better, it's an option for you)   Monster fries- get them! They are soo good. Again, the cheese was perfectly melted, which is sometimes hard for vegan cheeses. The onions were grilled to perfection. There wasn't enough sauce on there so make sure to ask for more if you like it saucy.   Milkshake- GET THEM! The most popular there is the strawberry. After tasting it I understood why! I'm not usually a big fan of strawberry milkshakes (which is why I got vanilla) but after tasting it, I wished I got strawberry instead.   The price of everything was pretty ya there (total came it to $40ish with tip) but you know it's hard to find good vegan burgers for cheap anywhere.",

Today I felt like something different so I took a trip down to Vege-Way. The twenty minute drive on my lunch break was totally worth it.   The burgers at Vege-Way are phenomenal. The burger and curly fries here prove that vegan food can be tasty and flavorful.   I wish there was one of these closer to my work or home. As for right now, Vege-Way boasts on being the only Vegan Fast Food joint in all of Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Pros: nice selection of vegan items. Banh Mi beef sandwich and chicken wrap (huge) are worth trying. Curly fries are similar to Jack in the Box. Worth trying this place at least once. I eat pretty much anything when I'm stressed out. Love to pig out here!  Cons: omni friends complained about the after effects from the burger. I realized I don't feel the best afterwards either. It's only with the burger too - maybe a preservative or oil they use. Most of the food here is way too oily, but that's to be expected from a fast food joint. A bit pricey for what it is. Drive-thru wait time can be hit or miss. Decent spot to drop by if I'm in the area.",

Their plant-based burger patties are cooked to perfection with crispy edges that I can't get enough of. The cheeseburger comes with a slice of vegan cheese, V-mak sauce (similar to a tangy Thousand Island salad dressing), and a fresh assortment of your typical burger veggies (lettuce, tomato, onion). The price ain't bad either and won't set you back a ton: $4.75 for a cheeseburger that doesn't make you feel horribly guilty after eating it.  On the occasions that I have used the drive-thru, service has been quick and efficient. Compared to the vegan fast food joint I frequent in San Diego, Vege-Way's wait time is minimal and service has been consistently friendly.",

    "text": "Vegeway is a vegan fast food joint with a very simple menu offering vegan burgers, fries, milkshakes, and a few specialties. It operates similarly to classic fast food places like Burger King and it even has a drive-thru window. The staff is friendly and the overall experience is a unique one for a vegan who wouldn't normally be able to order a burger and fries from a fast food restaurant.   The Hawaiian burger seems to be the specialty here. It is not on the menu, but it was recommended to me by the cashier. it was basically the standard burger but with grilled pineapple and possibly some other things added to the sandwich. It was sweet, salty, and delicious. The standard vegan burger was also very good. They now offer burgers made out of Beyond Meat, which has a much different consistency and flavor compared to Vege-Way's own burger patty recipe. The house patty is very tough and chewy, whereas the Beyond Meat is softer and fluffier.   The seasoned curly fries here are excellent. The strawberry milkshake was out of this world good. It was so smooth, creamy, and sweet, and went perfectly with the burger and fries.   Vege-Way offers up simple but high quality vegan fast food at an excellent price and is definitely worth trying for vegans in the area as well as meat eaters who wish to decrease their meat consumption.",

The burger was good but the ingredients seemed to be upside down (lettuce on the bottom with the patty on top) but that's minor. The curly fries tasted like regular curly fries. The milkshake was made with a mix of almond and coconut milk and it was thick, creamy and super strawberry-y. My only complaint about the visit was that it was super slow. The restaurant was empty so I don't know what the hold up was but our milkshakes took 20 minutes. Maybe it was the drive-thru holding things up?",

Negative:  I found mold spots on & in my burger bun once. Don't get me wrong.. sh*t happens & the manager was super nice & offered me a free meal.

    "text": "First time here.  Went with a friend/co worker who claims he would be open minded to try the food but when we got there, he ordered fries and got scared.   May as well have brought my ex.     The fries were good he claimed.      I had a Vanilla milkshake made with coconut milk and it was good...the cups are small for a large but most places are like that these days, the small cups are now the large cups except at Tropical Smoothie where large is actually a large.  I was a bit sad because I had to order the Beyond Meat burger, I have had that a lot and I wanted to try their burgers but every one is made with mushroom powder and I am HIGHLY allergic to mushrooms and so I decided to just try the Beyond Burger + orange chicken which comes with brown rice.  The Burger was juicy and had vegan cheese which is nice, no Mayo which surprised me but it didnt need it, it was very good, like eating an unhealthy burger at a fast food place.    But healthier and delicious!  The orange chicken was not to my liking, chewy, almost rubbery for me...  Super crispy...  Would I return just for a milkshake?    I dunno, probably not, the burger was good but you can get that a lot closer to my home/work locations so...but I am glad I tried it.  It was super clean, you can see what the cooks are doing (No hidden kitchen)   and they were super friendly and patient with me on my allergies, checking the ingredients and such....  We'll see.   I will update of course should I go back!",

I had 2 burgers protein- style : jalapeno burger with fresh sliced jalapenos (2 napkins needed) & the Hawaiian burger with cheese, tomato, pineapple & sauce making it a full 4 napkin burger.

That's where vege-way has been coming in. It's fast food, less guilt. I don't have to think of inhumanely sourced beef or chicken. Instead, I can just bite into whatever I'm eating with less guilt.   Their burger is pretty darn good. It doesn't taste like meat, of course. It has its own kinda earthy taste. I'd like if they had a different patty style, like how jack in the box has a few different types, but I understand that they are new to fast food, so it's a ground up learning experience. I'd also like if they added pickles. I don't really understand this one - pickles are just good.   Their chocolate milkshakes are perfect. Change nothing. The monster fries are pretty good, as are their curly fries. However, my order has now been messed up twice on the fries in two visits, so maybe get that checked out.   It's all worthwhile. A bit of expensive if you upgrade things, but I think it's definitely worth trying.",

There were no cars in the drive thru and no other customers and the employees were just standing around talking. When I asked the reply that I got was an \"oh, sorry\". No further apologies or anything, which was pretty disappointing.",

The staff there was working very hard behind the counter to get everything out in time.  There is a really small menu.  They offer a single and double burger.  You get lettuce and tomato.  You have to include your own pickles which are off to the side.  You can get fries and coke to make it a meal.  its approximately ten to 12 bucks per person. There are some other side dish things like fake nuggets.  I have no idea about those things.  They also offer shakes and I didn't have one of those.  Regarding the hamburger, It was one of the better vegan hamburgers I have ever had.  I liked everything about it including the bun.  Each person I was with liked the burger.  We had about (between the four of us) more than 60 years experience combined in eating meat and dairy free.  I don't think it will take me that long to come back.  This is a good place and I will continue to support it.",

And we also had the white chocolate peanut butter milk shake. Delish! Not overly sweet & tasted like a regular milkshake. All in all, great food, great service. My only complaint is I read about vegan cheese & I had asked for no cheese. They mistakenly added the cheese & it's the only thing I do not recommend on the burger. But the owner offered another burger without the cheese (very nice of him) but I wasn't that hungry. I will definitely return again and again. And a second location to open soon (early next year) so I will definitely frequent the new place. Go Vegeway! Loved it!",

So the whole family headed over to try it out and we were all extremely satisfied. We ordered a single burger meal, double burger meal, popcorn chicken, fried zucchini, and a chocolate milkshake. As someone who isn't a vegetarian but has been trying to make healthier choices like cutting out meat from my diet this place made me want to go full on vegan if I could have this everyday. The burger as many others said in their review was the veggie version of In-N-Out and not lacking on taste. The cheese as a few have said left a sweet after taste that I didn't like but my husband who likes sweet stuff didn't mind at all, at the end it depends on your taste, maybe have different vegan cheese options? I could sit here and rave forever about the food but why do that when you could just go and try it out for yourself? That's right, hurry and go try it out now! Last but not least the place was very clean as well as the bathrooms. You will also see chef Kenny the owner in his white chef's coat walking around greeting people and cleaning off tables after customers leave. Also it's a small dining area so when it's busy it can be hard to find a spot to sit and eat, not to mention if you have a little one like myself there are no highchairs, so be prepared to hold them on your lap as you eat. Other than that excellent place!",

Can people leave constructive critisism? ....having an opinion  is one thing but knocking a place that's promoting compassion to animals that's just asking for bad karma. Seriously let's appreciate the fact that we have a vegan drive thru in our city....if u dont like Vegeway take your wining to McDonalds!   And fyi... The burgers are freakin bomb here!

They are all amazingly clean and crispy and super refreshing and it doesn't make you feel like shit like a normal milkshake that comes along with a stomach ache!!  If you are going to get their burgers make sure you order ur with out their vegan cheese because they do use Daiya which isn't the best vegan cheese option! I cAn put up with it but most people can't! I wish they would switch to something from field roast  their vegan cheese is way way better!  Their Curley fries and sweet potato fries are off the hook! Bomb and they def use clean oil because you can taste and smell the fries when they come out!!   Customer service is pretty average for a fast food  joint! But to say the least awesome quick stop for the vegas vegan!!!  Shout out to the owner for opening up this place it's  awesome wish there was one on the north die by Durango and the 95",

    "text": "Long story short, VegeWay delivers exactly what is promised: vegan fast food.  I love love LOVE when new vegan restaurants open up! It made me even more happy to see a line around the corner for their drive thru on opening day. While I usually don't like when vegan spots use soy to replace everything meat-like (yes, soy is in everything here), I had to give this place a try. I tried their fish tacos and a burger. I thoroughly enjoyed all the toppings on the taco, and the \"fish\" did taste exactly like fish to me. When the burger came out, I was a little disappointed that I didn't get any lettuce or tomato. I told the cashier, \"I ordered mine with everything.\" He then lifted the bun to show me that, indeed, there was a thin slice of tomato and a little piece of lettuce inside my burger. I was then reminded that this is fast food. If this were a nice sit down restaurant, I would have had a problem with this. You cannot go to this place and expect great restaurant quality meals. Do not go to this place and expect healthy vegan meals either. Vegeway is fast food, as it advertises itself to be.   That may or may not be your cup of tea, but the concept is fantastic! Vegeway is a vegan restaurant that is clearly unhealthy; however, I would much rather have people eat unhealthy plant based food than unhealthy animal based food. This place is a great way for non-vegans/meat-lovers/fast food goers to incorporate some less damaging veganism into their lives!",

    "text": "I give very few 5-star reviews, but this place definitely deserves one -- excellent vegan food served drive-thru or at the counter with indoor seating, friendly service, all at a very reasonable, actually inexpensive price!  I arrived around 7:45PM on a Wednesday, 2 days after their soft opening & 2 days before their official grand opening.  The drive-thru was busy, and there were a lot of customers inside, but the wait in-line was brief & the counter staff was very friendly.  I ordered a Double burger meal, so that came with fries (I chose curly) & a soft drink -- all for about $10!    A small table had become available after I ordered, so I sat down after filing my cup with Dr Pepper, & waited for my order # to be called.  It took about 10 minutes -- very reasonable based on how busy the place was.  I added ketchup & mustard, refilled my drink with Raspberry Iced Tea & sat down to enjoy the meal.  I've been a vegetarian for almost 30 years, having all sorts of vegetarian & vegan burgers over the decades.   Some people prefer the type that do have similar consistency & flavor of beef, some prefer those made more of a mix of vegetable products & that don't really have the flavor of beef.    I tend to fall into the former category, and the burger was absolutely phenomenal!  The only downside is that it was pretty messy to eat -- the (vegan) cheese product made the two vegan meat patties slip & slide.  The fries were good but nothing all that special, and I learned the hard way that the Raspberry iced tea machine needs to be calibrated better, as the liquid product barely had tea or raspberry flavors (compared to the identical machine at other places).  After wolfing down my food, I was in a feeding frenzy.   I wanted another burger.   Turns out the guys at the table next to me were thinking the same thing.   It's not because there wasn't enough food in our initial orders, it was because the burgers tasted so good!  I ended up getting two more double burgers to go, & brought them home.    It's very tempting to eat one right now at 3:30AM but I'm fighting the temptation.   Even with two Double burgers in my refrigerator, I'm somewhat planning on my return trip to VegeWay.      For better or worse, it's on the opposite side of LV from me & in an area that I just haven't had a need to be in often.  But the food/price at VegeWay is so nice that unlike most other restaurants, this place will be a destination for me & I expect to be a frequent customer.  If you're a vegetarian/vegan that tries to avoid food that has the texture & flavor of meat & poultry, you don't have a need to try VegeWay.  Otherwise though, you should definitely try it.  Even if you're not a vegan/vegetarian, you should give their food a try if you're curious.     On a future visit, I'll give some of their other products a try.  Obviously, as a vegan restaurant, the clientele is rather limited.  However, there are enough of us in the LV area to keep this place fairly busy, even after the newness  wears off.       Think of it kind of like an In & Out Burger place for vegans & vegetarians -- comparatively inexpensive, flavorful food & friendly, intelligent staff.  The drive-thru lines can get kind of long & the strip mall parking lot isn't really set-up for long drive-they lines.   Also the interior seating area is kind of small, so especially at prime-time lunch & dinner hours, the place may be crowded, however based on my experience last night, the wait isn't bad, & very much worth it.  They do have wifi for customers, but it's secured so I guess you have to ask for the password (it wasn't posted).  The only negative thing I can think of is that the vegan milkshakes looked kind of small for the $5 price, but maybe that's just me being a cheapskate.  There are plenty of nice, expensive vegan/vegetarian restaurants in Vegas, but the only place I know for sure I'll show-off to my vegan & vegetarian friends that come to town will be VegeWay, & I'd love to have my carnivore friends give it a try too.",

    "text": "Now that I've tried almost everything on the menu, I feel fairly qualified to write a review that may help the Vegeway newbie out, and maybe even the owner, as there are just a couple of tweaks that would make this place a solid 5 stars. To make it more readable, I'll divide by category:  The excellent: 1. Beef sandwich. This is reminiscent of a banh mi sandwich; light, yet filling, slightly sweet and spicy, and refreshing from the cilantro and shredded carrot. This is my favorite item on the entire menu. 2. Chocolate shake. No one would be able to tell this isn't a regular chocolate shake. Perfect texture and chocolaty-ness.   The very good: 1. Cheeseburger. Yep this satisfies all the cravings for cheesy, decadent, filling, and \"meaty\". It would have been excellent except the cheese isn't quite there. It has a slightly plastic/fake flavor. I know vegan cheese is tricky but I've had better. 2. Vanilla shake. It ain't no chocolate shake but perfect texture. I can tell this is a nondairy milkshake which is fine, but you won't fool anyone with it. 3. Chicken wrap. This was much bigger than I expected, it looks and feels like a huge 5-pound burrito. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be served hot or cold because it looked like it was grilled yet when I took a bite it was room temperature and the tortilla seemed slightly stale. Still, this is another dish that will satisfy that comfort food craving.   Room for improvement: 1. Fries. I tried both sweet potato and regular fries on two different days and they were soggy both times. There is just no excuse for soggy fries and instead of them being a delicious accompaniment to your sandwich they're just a pile of disappointment. Please Vegeway, fix this and I'll come more often.  2. The Cajun sauce. So much potential but not executed well. Not enough zip or flavor. Sauces are easy, come on guys. 3. Strawberry shake. Strawberry shakes can either be amazing or just taste off. Unfortunately this tasted off. Just no. 4. Popcorn chicken. Not terrible but it just tastes like fried balls of dough. I couldn't really discern where the outside ended and the inside began. Nothing \"chicken-y\" about it in my opinion, but if you like eating anything fried and don't really care what it is, this may be for you.    I also have to add that the customer service is excellent. Always an enthusiastic greeting when you're coming and going. They'll help you choose what to get and everyone is very friendly. There are a handful of tables but it gets crowded at lunch on the weekend, but I can't vouch for other times. I live about 30 minutes away but I will definitely be back. They've hit on a niche market and they've just about hit a grand slam. Go and see for yourself, and I guarantee you'll be back for more.",

I'll be making my way here alot more frequently.   We need more places like this in Vegas, everyone needs to come here to support.  :-)",

The vanilla milkshake and vegan burger with curly fries is my go-to and is always delicious. I like their flavored dipping sauces too because they are SO tasty. Still have many items to try from Vegeway but with Chef Kenny's track record of delicious food, I know I'm in for a treat!  As a tip, prices are a little bit more than your average fast food joint. However, when you think about all of the really amazing ingredients that Kenny uses to create these tasty meals, it all boils down to QUALITY OVER QUANTITY! Yes it is still \"fast food\" but it's got to be better for you than most of the other fast food chains out there.  Love coming here and hope Kenny opens a location closer to the north side of town soon.",

They were also out of everything I originally wanted which really ticked me off especially because my fries were soggy and had zero flavor to them and were cold.

They are thinking carefully about flavor and texture at VegWay and I appreciate it. I'd suggest that new customers: 1) arrive at an off time, 2) try everything,  and 3) share it with an open-minded friend. It's not healthy food, but it's so yummy and it's nice to have a fast food option that doesn't include animal protein.   Yes, there were issues with mistakes in people's orders (60% of the orders while we were there).  Yes, the food output was slow.  But I still can't wait to return. The food was delicious (I want that \"milk\"shake recipe NOW), the cashier was incredibly warm and helpful, and the cook came over and talked to us about the food. He took immense pride at having prepared it.   My biggest complaint is that I have to drive so far to get there. I am a fan.",

    "text": "Hi Yelpers. I recently took the trip to VegeWay's Centennial's location. I cannot comment on the decor of the inside, I decided on the drive-thru. I decided to go with three stars on this review, so bare with me and I will explain why. For starters, let me begin by stating for the record, that I was somewhat mislead by the \"name\" and with that the trouble began.    So let me begin with the food was okay, not the best I've ever had and certainly not the worst I've ever had. I realized very quickly that I wasn't eating from a traditional \"vegetarian restaurant\", but more so a restaurant that specialized in \"meatless options\". Two completely different types of establishments. This place in my option is for meat eaters who want to take a break from eating meat once in awhile.   My order:  I ordered the double cheese burger combo, and upgraded to the sweet potato fries and a strawberry tea. The burger was good, and fries were hot and the tea was good. The smell was amazing and I couldn't wait to get my food home to take a bite. During the ride back home, I reached in and grabbed a few fries and they were slathered in \"GREASE\". Now, I realize that they had to cook the fries which involves frying them, but I could taste the grease and had to blot out the fries. Once I arrived home, I open the meal and dumped the fries out on paper towel to save my save the trouble of blotting the fries one by one. Overall, the burger was good but it also dripped oil and was quite messy. I realized quickly that it wasn't worth spending $12 bucks for a meatless greasy burger, fake cheese and greasy fries. I didn't feel healthy at all, I ended up with a stomach ache.   The review is a honest one, which is my opinion. I would urge everyone to go and try this place. I was impressed with the taste of the meatless burger, and for that reason I gave the place \"3 stars\" but for anyone who watches what they eat like I do and cares about their caloric intake skip what I had and maybe go with another menu option. I'll pass since I limit my consumption of fried foods, but to each their own.",

    "text": "Just had an experience there that was frustrating enough I had to Yelp about it before we even eat the food. We walked in to blaring EDM music with screaming tracks. As in, 1am downtown bar loud and most of the staff were dancing and head banging to it.   Listen to whatever you want -- I was 18 once too, but it's not the Electric Daisy Carnival, you're at freaking work. Turn it down.   We were going to eat there, got it to go so we didn't have to listen to that.  Not surprisingly, when I ordered, the cashier couldn't hear that I ordered two double combos. We pay and walk over to the right and realize we didn't get cups. I turn around and politely ask \"hey can we grab the cups?\"  The next minute was like an SNL skit of what everyone complains about millennials.   Rather than just say something normal like \"oh, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you asked for combos, let me charge for the difference,\" (aka: what to do when a totally understandable mistake happens...not a big deal) the cashier starts rudely (and totally unnecessarily) arguing with me on whether or not I ordered combos.  Seriously. I'm having this conversation. Well, trying to, I can barely hear over the music.    Even says \"Oh, and like you didn't even tell me what kind of fries you want,\" like that was his big evidence to make sure I knew I was the one in the wrong. Because, of course, the customer is totally responsible for knowing there are options on that one.   After a little more equally unnecessary back and forth he finally says \"uh I guess I can fix it.\" Thanks, dude. That should have been Plan A.  I've been there before and had everything been fine, but this experience kinda killed it for me. Definitely a lapse in management to have walked into the restaurant looking and being run like that.",

First impressions when walking in- looks like a old fast food restaurant with old rickety tables, dirty floor.  We were so hungry and were already there so we gave it a try. I had the house made burger with vegan cheese lettuce, tomato and grilled onions and curly fries my friend had the beyond burger along with fries , she also tried the orange chicken. Burger and fries were ok nothing I would come back for. My friend said the orange chicken was ok but needed way more sauce. What was the biggest turn off was that the cashier up front , and the drive thru cashier were handling money making orders  and never once  changed their gloves.  In the areas where the napkins were along with the ketchup you pump yourself the tops of the ketchup was dirty. Eat at your own risk",

They don't have a lot of options on the menu so that was kind of a let down, but I still give props for it being one of the only drive thru vegan restaurants.   I ordered the cheeseburger and I was feeling extra hungry that day so I also got 2 fish tacos (odd combination I know). The wait in the drive thru was like 10 minutes so that kind of irritated me, it's supposed to be FAST food right?! Finally came to my turn at the window and it took another 5 minutes or so for me to get my food and I was so hungry after a long day, grrr! I finally got to try the food and the burger was very good! The only thing I didn't really like was the sauce in it because it had an odd sweet flavor that didn't go with the burger at all. And for the fish tacos.......I was so disappointed! And I LOVE fish tacos! They tried, but I've had much better vegan fish tacos and again the flavor combinations just weren't there.  Whenever I go back to Vegas I'll definitely try out this place again and get the burger, just without the sauce!",

I ordered a milk shake (five stars), fish tacos (five stars), curly fries, double vegan burger, and chicken wrap. The burger tasted like egg foo young but less eggy and the consistency was amazing. The chicken wrap should have just been marketed as an avocado wrap because that's all I could taste. The fish tacos seem to be the best thing on the menu but they were slightly watery, the flavor profile was delicious. I gave it three stars because customer service was subpar and the food wasn't the best I'd had when it came to vegan/veg options. I'd say that aside from Shake Shacks mushroom burger that this place provides the best healthy lifestyle alternatives to eating meat. I just wish the customer service was better.",

This orange chicken i was eating from their establishment was grainy and tough i had to yank my teeth away each bite i took. Finally, taking a big bite of one of the bits, a string of -watever the fuck - was unchewable, having me to spit it out. Idk if that was a vein or wat but it was discusting. If this was a soy product, this would not have happened. And the orange chicken sauce is gross. Its very bland barely sweet. Dont think i will return, now i feel like this not a real plant based establishment. And im starting to think their dressing and shakes are also made with dairy product.",

Even grandma thought so, and she's old school meat and potatoes type!  The vegeburgers were good.  The mock chicken wrap was divine, could have fooled almost any staunch carnivore.  Filling too!  The best was the popcorn \"chicken\".  An absolute dead ringer for the real thing.  Well done, Vegeway!  We'll be back.",

I ordered a Double Vegan Cheeseburger meal and my companion had a Chicken Ranch sandwich that was not on the regular menu.  My burger was good but really messy.  I also wish I had ordered a single instead of a double but my eyes are always bigger than my stomach.  The fries were good too but I was too full to eat many after that burger!  I would definitely stop again and maybe try the fish next time.",

I over ordered so that I could try their food but I bet it's high in calories, so I didn't feel like I should finish it all. Hard to have any kind of idea how many calories or fats are in the food.

    "text": "Not a vegan, but I observe when traveling with my vegan brother. We stopped by this place on the way back home to California. I still eat at In-N-Out, so I hope it means something coming from me that this place is a worthy alternative.  I had their version of the Double Double, which tasted pretty close to the real deal. The texture of the patty was different, but not bad. Their special sauce also tasted much like In-N-Out's, but was a little runny. Not a huge deal, just a bit messier when dipping fries. They also have equally great non-In-N-Out food like popcorn chicken, curly fries, and wraps.  Finally, the biggest deal for me as a non-vegan who still eats vegan food from time to time, the price! It costs pretty much the same as the non-vegan food they're emulating, without sacrificing flavor. So if you're generally on the fence about vegan food because of the price, this is the place for you.  I really think this place could take off as THE vegan In-N-Out and hope to see them maybe open up a place in CA!",

    "text": "Veggie House is overpriced. VegeWay is overpriced.   Chef Kenny doesn't care to talk to you if you do not resemble someone he's met in the past as an acquaintance or friend or one who is likely to be a member of Yelp. If you are Caucasian with a North Face jacket on and sporting some horn-rimmed Oliver Peoples glasses, then yes, he will banter with you, but if you are Chinese and from a remote mountain village, then expect to be ignored and denied free samples.  But that was Veggie House. That was then, this is now. I will review VegeWay as VegeWay.  Do not order the hamburger. The patty is dry and the cheese, being vegan, tastes like Elmer's glue. The bun may not be Devonshire butter brioche, but it is an insubstantial mess.  The beef sandwich, an obvious take on the Vietnamese-style banh mi is a poor clone of the iconic sandwich. It isn't freshly baked French bread, but store-bought hoagie. The beef consists of diced pieces of dried soy jerky. For the price here ($6.50 or so) you can get 2 authentic banh mi sandwiches at a Vietnamese bakery.  The fried finger foods are mediocre, but proudly presented as vegan. Enjoy.  I do like the place at night, however, as it resembles one of those retro burger dives one would see still operating in places like Flint, Michigan, but with cheerful employees in their plant-based colored uniforms.  Verdict: Overpriced and mediocre",

It had so many indistinguishable stains it actually turned my stomach. I felt like I wanted to leave but didn't and was grateful because the food was so great. No one offered to upsell me the sauces so I asked what the flavors are and bought a sauce for a quarter and it was so worth it.  I hope they work out the kinks and can only get better.

I got the popcorn chicken, cheeseburger combo (curly fries and upgraded drink to van milkshake). I was happy with everything that came out of the kitchen. Food was warm fast (even tho they seemed busy inside and had a few cars in drive up) and I thought very well priced compared to other vegan restaurants.   My main suggestion would be to have a few more sauces readily available (only saw ketchup, jalapenos and what I am assuming was a vegan chipotle aioli which was a little bland for me).

    "text": "Since moving to the West Coast from New York, I've been confronted by all the In-N-Outs, and weeping vegetarian FOMO tears.  Enter the next best thing: a crispy, meaty veggie patty (actually, make that a double) stacked with crisp lettuce and tomatoes, squeezed between a toasted bun with a just a schmear of guac (free but you have to request it). I brought my omnivorous roommate here for his first ever vegan burger and even he was impressed.  I'm normally not a fan of Daiya cheese, which has its own not-quite-cheese flavor to it. In the burger however, it just works. It does stick to your teeth a little, but worth a little flossing for the flavor it adds.  Official prognosis: best vegan fast food burger I've ever had. I definitely see myself becoming a regular.",

    "text": "Not the best, not the worst. It's a tall order to make a vegan burger, and it's a valiant effort, but Vegeway misses the mark in my opinion. Maybe I'm just a spoiled Californian with easy access to the Amy's brand's flagship restaurant but this place left a lot to be desired.  First of all, the restaurant itself lacks any design identity or personality. It feels very hodgepodge and thrown together. Not a good first impression.   We ordered the burger meals with curly fries- they were the highlight of the meal, fried to perfection and piping hot. The burger \"supports\"- bun, sauce, lettuce, onion, tomato were all nice and fresh, loaded on in-n-out style, and the vegan cheeze was also tolerable, but the patty itself was dry, crusty around the edges, and tastes too much like it's central ingredient- cabbage. The proprietor of the business also owns a vegan Chinese restaurant and it seems there's just a bit too much influence from Asian cuisine/flavors to truly call it the \"American\" style burger it's aiming to be. I love fusion cuisine when it's intentional and both styles of cuisine are complementary but this felt like the Asian essence was competing with the expected burger flavors.   While they have a few other offerings like popcorn chickin and a fysh sandwich, the menu left a lot to be desired, but it was reasonably priced and service was quick.",

I chose the Spicy Chicken sandwich, curly fries and Strawberry Shake. The \"chicken\" tasted more like a mushy veggie patty. The spicy sauce was lack luster beyond belief, too many thick onions and tomatoes that made the bun wet!!! Not to mention, the paper that the bun is wrapped in was drenched with sauce on the bottom and wet before I even got a chance to eat it.   I would recommend the other location.   P.S.  they close the shake machine hella early...like McDonald's lol (I don't eat there but when I did).",

Horrible customer service and probably the worst experience I've ever had since going vegan. Waited almost 20 minutes for fries they left off our order because all the employees were busy with gossip hour. The food was a c- at best. Way over priced, even for vegan food. Sub par vegan food at that. Looks like a lot of people were complaining that they're always out of x,y,z flavor(s) of their shakes which I can attest to because they were out of the strawberry shake. Also, they have a B for a health code rating so there's that. Do yourself a favor and pass on this place. There's way too many other GREAT options in the area.  Also, the wait to get our order was ridiculously long. Nothing fast about this fast-food place. And cashier had a bad attitude. Lastly, it was about 60$ for 3 people.",

    "text": "My husband is wanting to try the Vegan diet for 6 months.  He found this place on FB actually.  Then I came on here to check the reviews on here to check out the menu and hoping to find more information on what's in their ingredients.  I thought there was a little hope with the signs posted saying if you have any food allergic, please inform them.  I know I can't eat at a lot of vegan, vegetarian place because they are soy and nuts central.  I don't think my husband thinks of it like that besides no meat and healthy diet.  I told them, I'm highly allergic to soy and nuts.  I asked the guy at the counter if it's safe to eat the soy free burger with my allergy.  He's not sure and asked someone else.  The girl gave me a really vague response.  I should be ok, but we have signs up to say you should be careful eating our food.  We don't add nuts in anything, but some of the food does have almond milk in the sauce or part of the recipe.  I personally know 80% of all buns has soy in it unless the make sure they an order somewhere for no soy buns or make it themselves without soy.  They're not sure themselves.  Then my next question is, what oil do they use?  The guy said soybean oil.  How do they make a soy free burger with soy?  It's possible they use their soybean oil for the patties and they might have soy in their buns.  They're not 100% sure.  I didn't end up eating anything here, since I don't want to have an allergic reaction to the food.  I did insist my husband to still try out the food, if he does like it, I can just do a drive thru pick up for him.  He go the double vegan burger with curly fries and drink for $10.71 tax included.  He said the curly fries were good.  The burger itself had no taste, it was very bland.  It's like eating buns with an omelette without any seasoning.  He did add their mayo sauce to it.    I personally don't think it's super healthy spot, it's like In-n-Out minus the meat.  Super unhealthy fried food.    We sat inside the restaurant and it's not ventilated...super greasy, oil feeling, our clothes smelt like oil when we got home.  Plus it smells like sewer in here.  They need to do something about the awful sewer smell.   This isn't for us.",

Objectively speaking though it was the most amazing transaction to have ever happened in human history, Vegeway gave me a pile of mouth turd and I gave them 8 of my precious currency.   I typically like to go to Vegan places once in a while in a ditch effort to save the animal kingdom one more human life's worth of food in meat (that thought was a lot to chew) ((as was  the vegan chicken wrap)) , and thought \"hey who better to ask what to get at a vegan place than the workers\"   For 1: dude was so annoyed I  asked.  For 2: dude was so annoyed I even existed.  For 3: dude made me legit sad I even came here For 4: who tf hire dude???  Honestly, trashiest customer service from any one employee I have ever met. Rest were really nice and pleasant though. (Thats why I gave it 2 stars, go them for having a nicer rest of the staff)  Got my food at which point I gave them another chance. Just like my father's that second chance was for naught. Sucked so much it hurts to even give a writeup. I almost never picked up my phone in an effort to forget this moment of my life ever happened.   But I really couldnt help feeling guilt for all the lives I could possibly save by writing this up (that parallel convergence with saving animal lives tho), so here I am. Save yourselves, it's too late for me.  *reaches up towards camera* *slowly loses grip* *pan camera away from lifeless body* *wow im a nerd*",

Other menu items are a little less successful- the \"beef\" bahn mi sandwich didn't do anything for me and was tossed after a couple of bites, and the fish tacos are best described as mediocre.  I've yet to try the popcorn \"chicken\", because it's always sold out.  Counter service is fairly friendly. They could use a speaker to announce order numbers rather than scream them. Also, there were multiple issues with confusion over the restaurant being closed or open, some customers being turned away, then others being welcomed- it's not a great feeling when it looks like they are picking and choosing who to serve, but it appears to just be confusion.",

Although I was surprised that the chicken wrap I ordered was grilled (as opposed to the non-grilled picture on the menu) I wasn't disappointed by the taste. It was a good size for the price. We ordered 2, and split curly fries and two sides of ranch and it came to about $20. Considering Vegas prices, I happily shoved them my card. Definitely a good experience.",

    "text": "Fantastic vegan fast food joint. If you have been to Veggie House (Chef Kenny's other restaurant) than you must try it out too! Me and hubby's first time here after trying out Veggie House 3 times, and we were delightfully surprised on how good the food and service was.   Environment: Very clean, new place. Not a huge place because you can drive thru and order!  Staff: Extremely friendly girl at the register and the rest was friendly saying goodbye.  Food: Selection isn't huge but you do have a selection of burgers, tacos, vietnamese style sandwich, milkshakes, fried sides (fries, sweet potato fries, popcorn chicken).   Price: Decent. Burgers are pretty cheap for vegan food. Good deal with the meals (upgrade to a milkshake for $2.50)  1. Double burger: Burger was huge with cheese, 2 patties, onions, tomato and sauce. The patties were moist and flavourful, you can see the plant based ingredients. Wasn't dry and grainy. The only thing I didn't like was the cheese, it stuck to the roof of my mouth in a \"fake cheese\" feel. Overall the burger was fantastic and flavour was there.   2. Sweet potato fries: Tasted like any other sweet potato fries. A bit soft but have a crisp.  3. Popcorn chicken: Fried perfectly. No seasoning on it but it comes with a dip and there is ketchup and sirarcha sauce on the side. Soy was moist but a bit stringy.   4. Mango milkshake: Tasted artificial mango, like a gummy mango candy. I'm not a huge fan of that as a drink but if you like your candy/sweet then the mango is for you!  5. Strawberry milkshake: First sip tasted artificial to me, like syrup but there was strawberry seeds in it. It's not a pink color at all, more white. After a while it's pretty good, and VERY less sweet than the mango. Thick too, just the way I like my milkshakes.   Overall, great food and price for vegan fast food style. Don't bee too picky, remember this is ALL VEGAN.",

By the time I ate my first meal it was soggy and not really fresh so I couldn't enjoy it. I ordered a regular burger & curly fries. The second time I came, I brought a friend and we ordered orange chicken, Hawaiian burger and curly fries. The orange chicken was totally different, but you wish you could add a side of rice to make it go together like a rice bowl instead of on a fries tray. The Hawaiian burger was amazing and fresh so all the juices mixed well together with every bite!   Would definitely recommend if you want to try vegetarian/vegan options, but not in a healthy way.",

VegeWay is a fast food restaurant that serves vegan food aimed towards people that have a particular diet/lifestyle or want to try something new. Its location is small, but does have a drive-through.   I wanted something light for a snack so I went with their popcorn chicken. For the price I paid I was expecting something a bit bigger. The popcorn chicken did taste like chicken, but I thought there was a bit too much breading. The side dressing or sauce that came with the popcorn chicken was definitely not ranch and tasted like it was watered down.   As of right now I'm not a fan, but may come back to try their burgers and other food.",

    "text": "Finally! Let's all admit it after spending a weekend in Vegas binge drinking sometimes all you need is a fast-food style burger and fries (greasy and not particularly healthy HAHA). And being vegan and trying to find this is close to impossible.... until I was brought to VegeWay!   My girlfriend had told me about this spot multiple times but we hadn't been to Vegas so when we finally got the chance to come out here you already know VegeWay was on our to-do list! I will start off by saying if you're looking for the normal healthy, low caloric, etc style of meal turn around lol this is the closest to a Big Mac/In-N-Out style of burger that you can get being vegan and I personally LOVED IT! Now I wouldn't eat here everyday but stopping by on our way out from Vegas is just perfect!   When we arrived the first thing that caught my eye was that they have a wide selection of food. Ranging from burgers, \"chicken\" sandwiches, fries, popcorn chicken, zucchini fries, Bahn Mi, fish tacos, shakes, and salads. When we came we got two burgers, regular fries, curly fries, zucchini fries, popcorn chicken, and a bahn mi for the road (yes we like to try everything!). Here is what the consensus is:   Burgers - 10/10 I'd definitely recommend getting the burgers here. They allow you to get a single patty or even a double. They also have a new burger with guacamole which we didn't do but based off how the burger alone tasted I'm sure guacamole wouldn't be a bad adder. The meat had a really good flavor and the sauce they add is the closest you can get to tasting like you're eating a Big Mac.   Popcorn chicken - 10/10 I would say these are a solid choice to get. The pieces are pretty thick with a nice layer of breading and deep fried to perfection. The sauce that comes with the chicken is really good too (it was this Cajun sauce).   Bahn Mi - 9/10 this had a lot of potential to be great but I think it was a bit dry in my opinion. They do put a sauce on it that tastes really good just not enough.   Lastly of course the fries are good (like all fries are) and the zucchini fries were decent. I would just recommend getting fries unless you're in the mood for zucchini.   So overall I would recommend anyone looking for a nice cheat meal to come here. Again don't come here looking for anything healthy lol and just a word of caution be ready to fork out a decent amount of cash as the prices are a little steep considering it's fast food.",

Firstly, I wasn't a big fan of the flavor of the burger, but I think that was because I made the mistake of ordering a double, instead of a single; flavor was too overwhelming.  Their fried zucchini and fries were great, though.  Will certainly be back to try another one of their entrees!",

Perhaps they could have grilled the onions to make the burger a little more appealing to the taste. The raw white onion over powered the burger just a bit. The cheese resembled the classic American cheddar after being melted over a how patty, but it didn't fool me. Overall though, it was a solid plant based burger hat I wouldn't mind having again.",

Recently I purchased 2 $14 Groupon vouchers and was given problems about using both. The Groupon btw says one per visit, and I said ok if I can't make 2 transactions I'll use this one then run to the store down the street and come back and use the other, and was told no that's not allowed...so somehow their vague description of visit means not the same day? I was like ok I'll use one and my husband will use the other, again I was told no because I own both and can't give him one. Dumbest policy ever! I was on that side of town and tried to use both with separate transactions and they wouldn't let me. A nice manager allowed me to a eventually because the Groupon was about to expire and I live far away, and I was poking holes in their policy wording.  But a Groupon is like a gift card in my opinion, and I can only buy from this business every so many months therefore it's not like I'm scamming them. Who cares if I use them both on the same day or different days???",

    "text": "I really dislike long reviews, but indulge me if you're so inclined. I gave ** as I just don't have it in me to rate it a *.   *I really LOVE Veggie House and I love Chef Kenny so I am really bummed that I am rating VegeWay as low as I am. I was really expecting a better tasting experience.   I am huge fan of vegan food and love veggie burgers, so naturally I make them pretty darn amazing. I was super excited to give VegeWay a taste as I do lot of vegan hopping around Vegas and have my regular favorites.   My experience here, however, was as bland as it can possibly be. For $9+ you will get a small veggie burger of your choice (light or dark patty - some like to call it \"chicken\" or \"beef\", which drives me CRAZY that Vegan people would use animal references AT ALL when it comes to foods they eat. It's illogical and ridiculous), a choice of curly or French fries and a small drink. The combo is just way too expensive, considering that making a veggie patty is a lot cheaper than meat, unless you are a shady eatery that buys the cheapest industrially raised meat :(  I could look past the price ($11 with tip), if the sandwich is actually delicious beyond reason, which, sadly, it wasn't what-so-ever. The \"chicken\"  patty is bland just enough to make you regret the purchase, but not enough to toss it. I finished it and can call this the least memorable food experience I've had recently. Which, again, makes me super sad because everything at the Veggie House is delicious (I was there again this week).  When I ordered I asked if they have a spicy chicken patty and the cashier said they do and it's a buffalo chicken patty. I thought, GREAT! Love it. But when I bit into it it was just a plain bland patty, topped with the (also) bland Sriracha aioli. When I took the first bite, that aioli.... squirted out of the sandwich all over the tray, my clothes and my phone. I was really expecting a nice piece of (maybe) deep fried \"chicken\"  with a super zesty, infused crust or a buffalo (red hot) sauce topping, but it was just the stuff they have at the condiment counter. Also, as I kept eating everything was falling out from between the buns. It was a huge mess and I just could not keep it contained. The buns, however, are very good and soft.   This was not a tasty experience, it was a huge disappointment. I've definitely had way Way WAY better vegan \"fast food\" in Vegas, where flavor, quality and quantity are major highlights.   Chef Kenny, please, try better. I'd most definitely recommend spice and herb infusion for the patties. There are a lot of great vegetable powders that can make these patties taste super delicious. Until then, I shall stay a regular at my regular vegan joints.   Sorry.",

But better. I let her try my fish taco and she ended eating the whole thing \"omg. I could live off these tacos and burgers\" she said. With a thumbs up. My 2 year old nephew loved the popcorn chicken and sweet potato fries. I wish we had more places like these. I saw the owner walk around talking to the other customers. Everyone's so friendly here.

Drove up and the cashier over the intercom was super nice. I began to give my order and she seemed a bit confused and I figured she was training, which made sense, no big deal. A young man took over the order and I stated again that I wanted the single combo with regular fries, a Diet Coke and popcorn chicken. I pulled up to the window and the guy was nice, but he seemed confused as to what I ordered and asked again if I wanted something to drink, I said yes, a Diet Coke. It was a pretty short wait for my food. While waiting I started noticing some of the signage on the window about allergies, hours etc... but everything was posted on printer paper and taped up like something you'd find behind closed doors, not out front where the customers can see it. This is a little thing but it's a sign that the owner/manager doesn't take much pride in how communication is is conveyed to the guests. He handed the bag over and said thanks, I asked \"what about my Diet Coke?\" He said sorry and gave me my drink. Again, he was super nice but both staff members I spoke to seemed confused and there was only one other car in the drive through. I didn't think much of it and figured this could be just a random circumstance and didn't get bent out of shape over it.  Ok, now the food. The burger was good and I liked the patty, interesting flavor and texture. Bun was good, special sauce was good and fresh lettuce and tomato. Now the fries, they were undercooked and soggy, bummer. The popcorn chicken had zero seasoning in the batter and it tasted like plain tempura batter. The fact that there's no seasoning in the batter and the fries were soggy leaves me to believe that there may be a quality control issue.   Here's the deal, if you're going to do a vegan version of In n Out Burger, you need to nail every order, every time. That's one reason why In N Out is so successful, great quality control and great food. Again, I really really wanted to like this place, but it just didn't hit the mark. I think a lot of people give it a pass because they are stoked about a vegan fast food place, but it's just not executed as well as it should be. Someone is gonna come along someday and open a concept just like this and do it right.  One last thing. I spent some time reviewing the negative reviews and I didn't see one reply from the management/owners addressing the issues. If you want to improve, you must engage with customers and learn from criticism. It's super important to read bad reviews and address common issues.",

The burger patty was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Very spot on!! The popcorn chicken was amazing- no difference at all to me from my chicken eating days. The milkshake was good, but we have Chicago Diner here which is crazy good. The entire time I was thinking about bringing my kids here as vegetarians the choices on menus are boring and/or abysmal.

Everything was fresh and tasty. I also got the 6 burger patties, but have not tried them yet, they do look very good. One thing that was disappointing, the staff needs training, they didn't not know how to apply the Groupon, the person working my order was wearing gloves, but then touched the register,  phone, food and back and forth...never changing the gloves. Sometimes I think using gloves is worse, because people don't get that cross contamination is the problem. If they have been trained, maybe they just don't care enough to change gloves, it's too much trouble, but that is your business. I would recommend, just watch the food handling.",

I hate it when eating means I need a tray and to avoid touching the table at all costs.   Almost everything was fried and the menu was very small. I guess that makes it easy to make a choice except that the menu is so small that you feel limited to the best of bad choices. Super unhealthy - I guess here the term vegan only means no animal products but not healthy.   I personally won't be back, but it was obvious that this place has its following. So if you really want a simple vegan McDonald's, have at it. There were plenty of customers, so they must be reaching their own niche which is fine.",

    "text": "Great concept - love that there's a fast food plant based restaurant in town. Would be great if there were more items identified as non gmo and organic on the menu. Also, not a fan of the daiya cheese that they use on the burgers. Would love to see an in house option or another brand. Not a strong choice to use in the plant based community as it's one of the least favorite options out there. Keep up the good work and thank you for now 2 yummy restaurants in the Vegas community.",

I got a burger strawberry milkshake and zucchini fries. Zucchini fries not worth the money. Burger was ok. Wouldn't order it again tho. Strawberry milk shake was delicious. Taste just like the real thing. Excited to try fish tacos next time.",

However, when I actually ate the burger, the vegan cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth and really affected my experience negatively. I thought that the patty tasted yummy on its own. It was very well seasoned! Overall, I would not crave nor try to come back again unless a vegan or vegetarian friend wanted to try this place again. Service was friendly.",

The vegan patty in the burger tasted and felt like real ground beef, which is no surprise coming from the culinary genius, Chef Kenny. The cheese was delicious and oozed from the burger. Even the Dr. Pepper was superb! I wouldn't be surprised if carnivorous patrons came over from the bar next door and thought they were actually eating meat. I'll definitely be back, and highly recommend this place to vegans and meat eaters alike! Let's make it a chain!",

When I went back in and asked for it, I saw him reach into a case by the floor and throw a handful of chopped vegan chicken which I discovered was half ice cold when I started eating. I also asked for a side of guacamole when I ordered which they also forgot. I will not go back here.",
