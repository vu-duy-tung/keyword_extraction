The owner came up and talked to us a few times, my water was constantly filled, if the waiter didn't know about a specific wine he woukd ask the manager and he personally came to our table to give us additional information about Italian wine. Amazing shrimp & lobster raviolis. I wish I had more!!! 5 stars forsure.",

We were expecting a cafe style restaurant and were pleasantly surprised at the elegant and inviting decor and atmosphere. The waiters were professional and the service overall was great. Now to the food.... AMAZING! Authentic and delicious! We ordered the lentil soup which was the soup of the day, so good! We ordered the heirloom caprese salad, so good! The margerita pizza was yummy, the house bread and oil was delicious. As an entree we had the shrimp paprika - to say it was delicious is an understatement. Each bite was mouthwatering. For dessert we had the gelato and shared it, also delicious. Coffee was good too!  We went with our four year old daughter and while we felt welcomed to dine as a family, we would likely opt to eat there for an adult night/date night in the future and maybe have a few glasses of wine with our meal. Great place to have dinner with friends or for a date night. Also great if you just want a meal guaranteed to hit the spot. When we arrived it was quiet, however, within minutes the place was full and you could hear laughter and great conversations happening. One of the owners even walked around with a smile on his face greeting everyone. It can't wait to go back again and again.  The prices seemed high when looking at the menu, but the food was quality and it was worth the price. Hard to find places like this that feel authentic and satisfy! I highly recommend this place!",

The dining atmosphere was upscale, the staff friendly and attentive.  The portions were ample, the pricing was fair, the menu was extensive and the presentation, artistic.  We started with warm, fresh crusty bread served with an olive oil tapenade.  Our entrees were the daily special, osso buco, the chicken Parm and the pasta with short rib.  All dishes were tasty and well-prepared.   Everything was superbly orchestrated under the watchful eye of Giuseppi, the owner.  Reservations recommended for weekend dining as this local gem has already been discovered.",

One of the best meals we've had in a long time! Love that it's in our neighborhood but it could easily fit right in with some of the best restaurants on the Strip.",

The staff greeted us with smiles and welcomed us in. So nice to have the choice of indoor or outdoor dinning, we chose indoor to soak up the ambiance. Which has an open floor plan so your able to take it all in, while soft Italian music plays in the background. Now for the food, which is what brought us there in the first place. The waiter told us the Chef's specials which had me change my mind and go with Chef's stuffed veal chop, my eye's are rolling back in my head, so delighted with this choice. My husband chose the fire roasted Lasagna. I'm sad to say he told me MY Lasagna doesn't hold a candle to this. But happy we found a new favorite Italian restaurant in our neighborhood.",

So looking through their menu I had a few options that caught my eyes but I was still stuck with the carbonara cravings, lol. So we asked our very courteous lady named Ronda if it was possible for them to make me a carbonara anything and that it was ok if it was not possible. Yes! Shortly after I had in front of me the BEST and most flavoured carbonara dish on earth! It was perfect!!! My husband got himself something I cant remember the name but it was also amazing (Yes, I tried it!).  A few things I want to point out besides the amazing food are the amazing decoration, this place is very inviting and beautiful, I absolutely love the images on the wall and the lamps; the  ladies room, I have never seen a restroom so fancy in a restaurant, and clean!!!  Also, the staff, everybody is very friendly and attentive and the chef is the best! Ronda and him made our  visit special!  This place is a must go to for the pasta lovers!",

Our waiter was extremely nice and the restaurant had a great look overall.   As an appetizer we got a chicken Caesar salad. When we told the waiter we were gonna share it, he was nice enough to split it into two separate bowls for a friend and I before bringing it out to us. The chicken was a bit dry and there were just way too many croutons. But on the bright side, there was just the right amount of dressing unlike most places I've been too where they don't put enough dressing. The portion was also surprisingly good even when shared with another person.   For the entree, I got the Pollo Marsala which was chicken breast with a wine Marsala sauce over it. It came with potatoes, sauteed string beans and carrots as the side. The sauce was great but again the chicken was a bit dry. The portion was also a great size for lunch.   Overall, great service, great look for the restaurant, but the food could've been better.",

    "text": "I've now been here two more times since my initial review and I don't hesitate to bump Prosecco up to the big 5*. The food I've tried is an easy 4-4.5*, and rounding up is a no-brainer given their solid wine list, availability of daily specials, and that they are open not just for lunch but all day as well.  On my last visit, my party did mostly specials - the octopus appetizer special was absolutely fantastic, perfectly cooked with lovely texture. We also split up a salmon fettuccine in vodka sauce, which was divine. I opted for the sea bass special which was also very well cooked, and a friend did the osso bucco over risotto. After I tried some, I had some regrets about not getting it!  Don't skip dessert either. I'm not a huge fan of the cannoli here but the prosecco-infused custard is to die for. I also enjoyed the small bit of tiramisu I managed to steal from another friend's plate.  All in all, super lucky to have another quality Italian option on this side of town.",

The flavors of the dishes we sampled were bland (calamari $13, shrimp paprika $29, and chicken parm $24)...we skipped dessert as even their Gelato was $8 and for two people with drinks we were already reached $100.  Price wasn't the driving decision here it certainly would be worth it for the taste and service were lackluster. No plans to refer or return.",

Interior is beautiful with a lot of versatile seating for booths, seats and 1/2 and 1/2 style tables.  Bread served before our meal was great.  My husband had the eggplant parmigiano. Very good and he has been dreaming about the delicious sauce it came with ever since.  I had the sausage with broccolini and golden potatoes. Great spice and flavoring on the entire dish. I can tell they make their own sausage in house and it was the best sausage i've had in Vegas so far.  Highly recommend this place. We're certainly going to be returning here often.",

The wife had linguine with lobster tail and I had smoked salmon tagliatelle with vodka sauce, amazing food quality and flavors. Desserts where good too! The only reason I wouldn't give them five stars is due to service front of house, it is spotty at best and seemed awkward and absent at times. The top guy Niko checked on us at the end, we told him we were celebrating our anniversary and he realized his staff had dropped the ball on even acknowledging that (was noted in our open table reservation) so he comped us two after dinner Limoncello drinks, very nice of him. A bit noisy,acoustics could be dampened. As a side note, some dishes were finished by table side service, like filleting a cooked fish table side and also fettuccine Alfredo prepared table side. Table side service is pretty cool and fun, not seen much these days. Already anticipating our return!",

Our server never really greeted us and if he did it was brief and felt cold. I'm also sure the owner/manager was here our entire meal and we saw him go over to every table and say hello yet he never came over to ours, not even once.

We came in around 5:30pm on a Wednesday so it wasn't too busy.  The server was very nice and the busser was awesome he kept refilling our water so quickly.   Cajun shrimp pasta was awesome! It was a white sauce and their seasoning was so good not too salty but so much flavor. The shrimp was served on a skewer and they were charred and delicious!   Fettuccini Tocca with short rib (beef) was a red sauce and very flavorful, a little more heart. The beef was tender.  We also got the grilled octopus appetizer which was soooo good!! We also got the tiramisu for desert along with the cappuccino. Although they don't have milk alternatives...  All in all the service and food was awesome. The only reason I couldn't give this place a 5 star was that l, the owner/manager there, greeted and checked in with all seated and newly seated tables while we were there. He checked on them asking how their service was, food, even having small chats with a few regarding wine and such. Never once did he approach our table. He even stopped by the table next to us just to say hi and see how the guy was. New tables of families were seated and be greeted them all. I just thought it was odd and rude that for whatever reason, not once did he ever stop by our table to say hi or ask how everything was. I even mentioned it to my bf who said that he noticed as well. That kind of rubbed me the wrong way...I mentioned it on a note card they provided with the bill...so hopefully in the future it's something they can keep in mind. If you're going to treat your customers and build that relationship and atmosphere, perhaps that should be done with all. As it seemed they did, with ALL, except one!",

My cousin and I went in tonight for dinner after a really long day of work for me and I wanted to enjoy my birthday dinner. We got there at 915pm and they close at 10. I knew it was kind of late but I thought it looked like a nice place to enjoy ourselves. I expected a lot better service being that I do work in the service industry. We waited for our water more than 10 minutes and there were only 2 other tables still in the restaurant. So being that it was slow I felt like I could've gotten serviced faster. As I sat down at the table, I could see into their kitchen area where I saw multiple employees just standing and talking while we waited for WATER! We almost got up and left but we were hungry and decided to stay. As we sat there we saw the 2 tables next to us get treated way better than us and actually serviced. We then decided to have our food to go because we felt rushed and unwanted there. The server didn't even tell us his name probably because he didn't care to give us the quality we deserved.  It's sad that we experienced this type of service because the food was delicious. Since the food was good but the service was poor this is not a place I would come back to or even tell a friend to try. Management should really talk to their employees and remind them that this is a customer service/hospitality based job and they should never make their guests feel unwanted or like a burden.",

    "text": "Ah. Prosecco. People, you are wasting your time and money going anywhere else. This is a True and very authentic Italian restaurant where the food is high QUALITY and from the very best ingredients. The calamari, wonderful. The service, excellent. We have had the lasagne ( correct spelling), pizza, tiramisu, an amazing special dish with shrimp from the Mediterranean,  the other night a bottle of Chianti from Tuscany that made me swoon and of course, Giuseppe the friendly owner takes pride in welcoming everybody. Must go. Must. ] Just read a review where they say it takes too long. PEOPLE SLOW DOWN!!! This is how it is done outside the worker bee fast paced USA where people rush to eat and simply gobble down their food and sprint out. This is a place to kick back, laugh, socialize, linger over drinks and dining with friends and family. The idea is to slow you down and RELAX you. Do not miss the whole point. It is not Chili's or Outback. This is an Italian RESTAURANT, an experience. Just breathe and enjoy the wonderful flavors, atmosphere and good company of your dining partner/s.",

Had dinner here last night with my husband and daughter and EVERYTHING was outstanding: the service, the food, the desserts, the ambiance.  Joaquin - BEST server in Las Vegas, hands down!  Giuseppe and Nico are super friendly and accommodating.  It's not often that you see the owners mingling with their customers and every table they visited, the guests had smiles on their faces.    We started with the Burratina Dinner antipasti.  For dinner, I ordered the Sea Bass special, my husband ordered the Fettuccine Tocco, and my 2-year-old had the children's pasta with marinara sauce (which she loved!).  For dessert, the delicious tiramisu and gelato.   We are planning a special birthday celebration here for my MIL and Nico took the time to sit down with us and offered suggestions on what to serve.  He created a delicious menu and we're so excited to celebrate here.  If you haven't dined here yet.....it is a MUST!!!",

I felt the prices were high so they can try to make the money back that they spent on renovations . When I was asked if I wanted a glass of wine I really felt that the waiter wanted me to spend more money , he didn't genuinely want me to have wine. Maybe I only felt this way because I was the ONLY person in the restaurant so there was awkward silence. Will not return. If this place stays open for 8 more mothers I will be shocked.",

    "text": "After reading Roger E.'s many reviews of this local restaurant we thought we would give it a try.    The location is twice the size of the old Round Table Pizza and very, very nicely decorated.   From the very first greeting you receive from  \"Nicco\" and the staff at the front, you know you are in an establishment that caters to the customer. We were seated near the bar in a single sided booth with tables right next to us.  Not my favorite seating, especially for a cozy dinner with friends.  But, that was overshadowed by all the good aspects of this restaurant.  Our waitress was \"Teya\" who was also the bartender.  Sharp, classy and efficient.  She checked on us periodically and her assistants always kept our glasses full.  Our group started with the Ruby salad which was very fresh and cold.  It would make an excellent lunch as it was large and tasty. For our main courses my guests had a chicken and veal dishe and I had the veal chop.  All very good with excellent accompanying sauces.  Dessert was a treat with our favorite being the banana Nutella crepe. My only regret was waiting so long to try this place. We have been missing out on a great local dining establishment.  We might request a normal table or booth next time, and hope Teya can be our server once again !!!",

The service was great, very attentive and on point. The owner is noticed helping his employees and also servicing the tables which is pretty awesome to me.   The food is phenomenal. We had the bruschetta to share and it was one of the bruschetta I've ever had. The tomatoes were fresh and the cheese was so delicious.  They brought some bread and an olive oil with crush olives dip, which is delicious and complimentary. I've had the chicken Limone and I love it. Chicken was juicy and  with the capers and butter perfectly seasoned the chicken. Their steak and chicken Marsala were also quite delicious. My husband had the ravioli and I thought it was great even though I don't like creamy too much. Over all this is a great dining experience and we love bringing our family here.",

    "text": "I have been to this lovely restaurant several times but recently went for lunch a couple of days ago.  Right now, the heirloom tomatoes are AMAZING and we enjoyed them in the caprese and the house salad.  I would order just the heirloom tomatoes with some balsamic if I could!  When we had gone for dinner, I loved the marinara sauce they house made.  It was so flavorful and had the right amount of garlic in it.  We liked it so much we asked for a side of it when we ordered the pizza.  Be sure to ask them which pastas are 'fresh' pastas.  That makes a difference in your pasta dishes.  If they have the cheese wheel (aged in-house) with shaved truffles-- I highly recommend it.  It is a beautiful dish and is quite a show as well!  One suggestion but I don't know if it's possible-- I had stayed a month in Hermosa Beach and loved the Italian restaurant Fritto Misto.  There you can build your own pasta choosing your type of pasta, sauce and any add ins you want-- meats, veggies etc.  They had ALL fresh pasta there and it was so satisfying ordering exactly what you want on your pasta.  Just a suggestion.....",

I thought the place seemed oddly familiar - 3 years ago when I came out this way it was a dark and dingy pizza joint and now it's a bright and beautiful Italian restaurant.  We were very quickly seated and greeted with a warm welcome. There were two servers working at the time and they were very polite and attentive.  We ordered ravioli, a pasta with bolognese sauce and a pizza for my 2 year old. The ravioli and pasta flavors were amazing, you could definitely tell they were freshly made. As a precaution though, their sauces seem to be a little heavier on the wine content than most other places (but I didn't mind!) The pizza we got for the kid was HUGE for a kids meal, and was oddly topped with a handful of fries - which was a little weird.  Oh, we also had the calamari appetizer - the portion size was great and it was fried to perfection (with clean oil) and served with a slightly tangy but light marinara sauce. I don't normally like marinara because it's so thick and chunky at most places, but I feel they really perfected it for this appetizer by keeping it on the lighter side.   You could really tell that this place pays close attention to detail - from the homemade croutons, to the amazing olive oil dipping sauce for the bread, all the way to the completely spot free glasses they pour your drink in.  This was a truly wonderful casual lunch experience. I hope their dinner service is equally as good because I want to go back and try the seafood linguine!  In summary, it's a wonderful local Italian restaurant that really hits the spot.  Keep up the good work!",

I asked if it was possible to serve us food in that amount of time or would he be boxing up our lunch and throwing us out. I probably should have just left but decided to stay. The server was friendly and apologized for the treatment at the door and he assured me that we would not be rushed out. I do try to support local businesses and wanted to give this place a good review but it was a bit overpriced and the first impression was not welcoming. We spent $77 on one pizza, a salad and an order of calimari. For one adult and two kids. I did enjoy 2 Bellinis but again a bit pricey for a neighborhood restaurant",

We split a salad and pizza as appetizers. Asked server about spinach in the salad before ordering since I am allergic. He said it was in there and unfortunately couldn't remove it since it was a mix. We ordered anyway because I could make it work. He brought the salad out already separated to be shared and had managed to give all of the spinach to my husband without being asked!  The pizza was delicious. I will go back just for it!  Main course was the lobster pasta at a steal for $29 each. The lobster was excellent and the sauce had a nice surprise flavor to it. We were too full for dessert. We will be back!",

I am unfortunately deducting stars for the main dishes. Because it's an Italian restaurant I ordered a pasta and seafood dish. The dish was very salty with the pasta sauce tasting very bland and smooth similar to a jar. I was also disappointed that the Parmesan cheese that they bought to the table was not the same shaved real cheese that was on the salad..it was the powdery kind from a shaker. My husband had a chicken dish. He said the chicken was cooked nicely but lacked flavor. I would come here for a lunch salad. But this is an expensive restaurant and I feel the main dishes did not live up to what is expected at these prices.",

It says on the yelp menu $14.00 it's actually $16.00 once you get there. Please change the prices on here :/. Also surprising is that with these price you don't get a side salad? My sister had the lasagna and my mom the eggplant both were ok but again not for the price. I could see having these prices if your on the strip but your not. I probably won't visit again there's too many other Italian restaurants in town with better prices and better food. Giving three stars for decor and server.",

We were a party of four and shared the ruby and caprese salads, then the bianca and margherita pizzas. All were wonderful, and we had enough pizza left over for another meal! Our waiter, Nicholas, suggested a bottle of white wine from Argentina, a fabulous wine I had never tried. Service was equally great. Nicholas was friendly and attentive and the man who bussed our table was very courteous and did not allow our water glasses to get less than half full, a blessing on a hot July day. To top it off, Ladies, there is a wonderfully scented scrub in the restroom. This is definitely on my list to visit again!",

    "text": "Food was pretty good. I had eggplant parm with pasta. He had an alfredo dish with Cajun shrimp. The marinara was a little orange and a little too sweet for my liking, but that is just personal preference. If you like tangy sauce, you may not like it. The eggplant tasted like it had a little nutmeg. Excellent. The alfredo and shrimp. Excellent.   They bring fresh bread after you order your drink with a thick pesto olive oil. Very good.   We had the tuna tartare for an appetizer. Very good.   Now, the reason for only three stars. You guessed it - service. Marco G was prompt when we arrived, getting our drinks fairly quickly.    A few minutes later when the bread was gone, so was Marco. The kitchen area has a glass window, so you can see all of the guys in back - talking, laughing, eating with their mouths open, and showing each other stuff on their cell phones. More laughing. Meanwhile, boyfriend's drink runs out, and it's 30 minutes later and we don't have our entrees.   I can see this being the type of restaurant where it's about Italian family (most of the men had hair to their shoulders) where everyone is one big family and guests are included. This could be okay for someone who is drinking wine and hanging out for a two hour dinner. We were not.   Oh, and the fungus nats from the plants were bothersome. I told the girl on the way out that if they put an inch of sand in their plants, it should stop that problem. They are attracted to vinegar, which of course, I had balsamic on the table in a little bowl that I had to constantly watch.   So overall, good food for a decent price, if you have a couple hours. We will not be returning.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here for our anniversary tonight. This place came highly recommended so we decided to give it a try. It was pretty slow in there so we were greeted by the server quickly & he got our drink order. Nothing crazy, just some waters & an iced tea. Then he quickly went over the specials, which didn't seem to special just like slight variations from menu items. We ordered the Burratini appetizer and a ruby salad. They came out relatively quickly & tasted great. Then we ordered our entrees. I got some raviolis & my husband got the special filet medium rare. My food was good, there was one tough piece of asparagus, but whatever, the rest was good. My husbands steak, however, was over cooked. When the server came over, he informed him the steak was over cooked, the server kind of froze and another server came over, the steak was brought back to the kitchen where the cook poked at it, then she brought it back & said \"it looks pinker in the kitchen light\". My husband was so shocked he didn't know what to say so he just decided to eat it. My husband didn't want to cause a scene, but he's a chef, he knows how a medium rare steak should look. Pro tip: when the customer says the steak is over cooked, YOU GET THEM A NEW STEAK. Don't argue, that's not cool. Dinner started off well enough, but we won't be back. Bad customer service.",

    "text": "Great Italian food. While driving back from boulder to Vegas we decided to give Prosecco a shot and we were not disappointed. They started us out with their amazing house baked bread served with an incredibly tasty olive spread; which I could have eaten 4 baskets on my own if you let me. For appetizers we had 2 orders of the Bruschetta and a Calamari Dorati- a perfect start. For the Insalati we ordered two: 1. the Heirloom Caprese, the Burratta (mozzarella) was perfectly creamy and salted and the heirloom tomatoes were tender and sweet and the EVOO they used was of the highest standard. 2. the Ruby, which is abeet salad with goat cheese, pecans, and greens drizzled with a sweet vinaigrette. The perfect combination of sweet, bitter and crunch We loved both For dinner we ordered family style: Margherita Pizza - this I did not get to taste my 15 year old devoured it before i looked up. He said it was good  Agnolotti di Zucca - a pasta filled with butternut squash and ricotta cheese in a sage sauce. Light and delicious Tagliatelle al Salmone - pasta sauteed with salmon and in a vodka sauce. Perfectly cooked pastawith just the right amount of cured salmon and vodka sauce not to overpwer it. Spaghetti e Polpette - spaghetti and meatballs. The pasta was a perect al-dente the meatballs very tender and the marinara scratch made Fettuccine Tocco - fettuccine with braised short ribs. OMG the short ribs were so tender you could eat it with a spoon We finished dinner with 3 desserts and coffee: Cannoli - reminded me of little Italy NY Banana Nutella Crepe - you can't go wrong with Nutella And the chef's special an Apple crisp served with a Tahitian Vanilla Gelato. We enjoyed everything here. The food, the service and the ambiance is 5 star",

We were in a bit of a rush so he instead removed the item from our bill, classy guy! Kept it from being 3 stars... food took a while to come out. I was convinced to try the Osso Buco, an off the menu item, holy crap was that good!

From appetizer to dessert, nothing disappointed. Tonight they had a guitarist playing a great mix of contemporary and classic tunes.

    "text": "Came in for dinner the other night... The place is really clean and the ambiance is nice.  Right as you enter, the smell of fine cuisine is in the air.  We get seated and start off with the calamari which was great.  The olive puree they have to dip your bread into was different, but delicious.  Most of the pasta dishes there are pretty standard.  However, my review is mainly about the special truffle cheese wheel pasta.  First of all, don't have your server make it... have one of your chefs come out to prepare it.  The server was splashing sauce everywhere and really didn't look like he has ever been in a kitchen before.  The special tasted horrendous.  I asked the server to taste it and we asked him, \"Is it supposed to taste overly bitter?\" Guess how he replied... \"I don't know, I've never tasted it before\".  Really?  REALLY???  They were kind enough to take the special off our check but go elsewhere for pasta.  Grand Lux inside Venetian or Giada at the Cromwell will satisfy you more than this spot.  \"Thank you, next!\"",

The chef is there every day and comes up with delicious daily specials. The pasta dishes I recommend are their raviolis and their pasta in the cheese wheel. The cheese ravioli is my favorite dish here because the sauce is made to perfection. The cheese wheel is not only a delicious dish, but is also comes with a table-side presentation where they mix the pasta in front of you.  DRINKS: They have an interest bar with a wide wine and cocktail selection. I highly recommend the Southside, it is my favorite drink here. The bartender is really great at making the drinks to you liking and will fix any drink if it doesn't come out how you want it.  SERVICE: The waiters here are very friendly. I am most shocked that they are very knowledgeable about the dishes. The waiters are able to tell you how the dishes are prepared, what dishes would be best for your liking, and they are even able to bring out the dishes and serve them properly. I had a fish dish and the waiter deboned the fish as well as split the serving without the customer having to ask. The manager and chef even came out to my table to introduce themselves and make sure everything tasted good.  ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant is beautiful. They bring out candles, bring up the blinds when the sun is setting, and have a gentleman playing the guitar and singing to set the mood for the restaurant.",

My husband ordered the fettuccine tocco. We also had a carpaccio appetizer. I really don't want to be hyper critical or mean. There was so much wrong with the meal that I did not even want to tell the restaurant staff because it just sounded like too much. The seafood was overcooked except for one clam that was hiding under my Langostino. The pasta is cooked very well and the sauce was delicious. My husband's dish included fresh egg pasta which had been prepared very early in the day and reheated to a point of becoming like a pudding. The short ribs were slightly tough and bland the only flavor was the flavor of the red wine. If you were in the area, I would suggest that you try one of the other really amazing Italian restaurants that are very nearby. We tried. Something new instead of our usual choices and we regret our choice.",

The tables where comfortable and, the lunch prices where reasonable when you look at premium products. However, that is where the positives stop. It was realitively slow and, our waiter took about 15 minutes just for him to come over. The bread /oil everyone else had wind up coming out minutes before the food did. The buser kept filling up my Arnold Palmer with, unsweetened ice tea. The Waygu burger tasted absolutely fantastic but, the bread was a sourdough which completely disingrated while eating the burger due to all the juices and fillings. I probably would suggest a different bread or, cut back on some of the fillings to keep the burger intact. Also, STAY CLEAR of the water because, it is probably the hardest tasting tap I have ever tasted.",

    "text": "We just finished dinner there no less than 20 minutes ago and to be honest we were very disappointed. We were dining with our my mother in law who was turning 69 today and we explained as such to the beautiful hostess.  But there was mention throughout the evening by any staff member of the special occasion, nor at dessert which is fairly commonplace.   To further add insult to injury, we arrived for an 8pm reservation  of 4 at 7:56 but weren't seated until 8:19.  I get that there are some uncontrollable aspects with multiple other parties not clearing their table as expected, but no offset was ever offered.  No compliementary cocktail, no appetizer compliementary of the chef, no apology whatsoever.  Overall the food was very mediocre at best. The bread was delicious and the large portion of herbal dipping oil appeared fantastic, but the reality is the oil was it was seriously lacking any seasoning and tasted more like grass/herbs than a typical higher-end dipping oil for the price points in this restaurant.  We ordered the special octopus, which was a huge portion but terribly under seasoned and nothing compared to the top octopus in the city at Milos at Cosmopolitan.  It was effectively chargrilled with no seasoning at all.  It was she first time I have ever had to salt octopus.  We ordered the sausage entree which was fairly spicy and fringe undercooked which hopefully does not come back to haunt us tonight.   We ordered two pasta dishes of which one was a B and the other C-.  Both were heavy on the pasta and light on the ancillary components that sold the dish: the meat, cheese, and veggies.  Finally we had the \"people's favorite\" pizza with artichoke and prosciutto which was okay.  It was a white pizza which the menu didn't describe, but the waitress happily brought a huge portion of marinara when requested to supplement.    Overall we were just sorely disappointed as first time guests for an avg check of $26 per person before alcohol.  With so many delicious Italian options on Eastern, I don't see any of us ever coming back to Prosecco.",

I think we had a pasta dish and a pizza, and neither stood out. The decor was trying to be trendy and hip, but it wasn't quite there. If this was in a small town I'm sure it'd be the top Italian place, but there's a half dozen Italian places I'd go to in Vegas before returning here, I think.",

    "text": "SUMMARY: If possible, I'd rate 4.5. The food is very, very good---but portions quite small, and delivery charge is high at $6.  Overall, $40 spendy for 4 pieces of ravioli, 3 ping-pong-sized meatballs, and a piece of tiramisu size of a *small* square drink coaster.  DETAILS: Stumbled upon Prosecco Fresh Italian Kitchen on a night when there was no food in the house and decided to order out. It is too expensive to do this very often, but it was incredibly delicious, fresh, and thoughtfully and expertly prepared.  My Order:  Agnolotti di Zucca (\"Moon-shaped pasta with butternut squash and ricotta cheese sauteed in a light butter sage sauce\") -- very modest portion, but exceptionally good -- hand-crafted pasta, like a ravioli, the sauce was just as described, perfectly seasoned, and accented with a jot of fried sage.   Ordered a side of meatballs, which was fortunate, because the portion of the entree would have been insufficient a meal -- with the 3 meatballs, it was perfection! The meatballs were scrumptious, served in its own little container with a flavorful marinara sauce, with a little bit of accenting cheese over the top, and bits of fresh basil. They mischarged me for thee meatballs at $6.00---I later learned their standard charge for THREE MEATBALLS (which, again, are ping-pong-ball-sized) is $18.  The meal also came with wonderful, fresh, bread--and an herbed dipping oil. Complex, subtle, and delicious.  One review said that this very oil \"needed seasoning,\" by which I'm guessing they meant salt.    However, one of the *best* parts of this restaurant--unlike most of the quite pedestrian restaurants you can order from in this region---htheir restraint in \"seasoning\" (meaning: salt) throughout the entire meal was a relief, and let you actually taste thee natural flavors--not just a salt bomb.  For desert I tried tiramisu--which was wonderful, and in keeping with the thoughtful \"seasoning\" of the savory dishes, it was not overly sweet. Most places in the Las Vegas Valley, I ave found, smash you over the head with sugar. This didn't.  My first impression was the tiramisu was on the teeny tiny side. However: like everything else, it was of the very highest quality, and in factm among the best tiramisu I've had, with slim slices of homemade, ever-so-slightly sweet cocoa/chocolate \"bark\" perched on top in addition to the traditional nice bitter cocoa dusting of tiramsu. The cream/custard was sublime. And there was a wee dollop of chantilly cream to the side, along with a spriglette of mint. The only misfire of the whole meal was a 1/2 maraschino cherry in the cream. At first I thought it was a raspberry, which would have been nice, but a maraschino cherry? An ironic wink, perhaps? But unnecessary.  The meal before tax and delivery-tip was $28---for one smallish but delectable entree plus 3 very modest-sized meatballs.   The delivery fee of $6 seemed high.  All told, it was $40 with tax and delivery and tip.  This quality of restaurant--the elevated taste--is rare near Henderson.  Most places that deliver, particularly, tend toward mediocre, run-of-the-mill, and/or chains.  Prosecco Fresh Italian Kitchen is unique, smart, creative, and could hold its own, and be popular, in any major city with an educated clientele with high expectations and discerning palates. But for me, given the price, a once-in-a-while splurge!",

The owner and chef are both from Italy and that reflects in the menu and taste of the food. Make sure to hear the daily special when you go, I've had it two of the three times I've been and each time was fantastic. I love trying new dishes and My favorite so far is the black squid ink pasta!  It looks strange bc the sauce was black but man what an amazing dish!

This is a genuine Italian thin crust pizza made with quality ingredients. The smell and taste will transport you right to your favorite pizza pie in your favorite Italian town. Another thing is that they charge a fair price, which makes it taste even better ;-)  We had Marco as our waiter. He was excellent. Great customer service. He made some suggestions for us based on my questions. He also was smart to consider our vegan thing and so instead of bringing their tapenade which has anchovy (as I recall), he brought plain EVOO to go with their delicious bread. Being vegan/vegetarian customers, we got the capellini with tomato and basil, and some squash ravioli with sage. We also got a big bowl of minestrone soup. Everything was absolutely delicious.  We met one of the owners Alessandro who was a friendly and charming guy. It was fun speaking Italian with him. We will definitely return, we had such a nice evening here. The ONLY reason why a 5th star is not added is due to my choosing to reserve the fifth star for delicious establishments which offer all organic food.",

If you like beets, the beet salad was wonderful, combining just the right amount of beets, goat cheese and candied nuts with a light dressing on a bed of greens.  Second course; was the butternut squash ravioli's in a sage butter sauce, Also equally delicious.  I would have liked to try their desert but I was to full but will be going back again.  Great for a casual, yet sophisticated date night, great lighting with a nice ambiance. Prices were reasonable but not cheap either...for the quality of the food, prices were fair.

Overall good food, couple areas of fine tuning  Ambiance Mod/European interior with a mix of industrial exposed ceilings and fancier touches like crystal chandeliers and modular art. A mixture of tables, semi-private booths, and more private booths.  Feels expansive and open yet intimate and warm.    Service We were seated quickly and then waited some time for service although servers came to check on us.  Most likely a factor of needing to fine tune team work. One of the owners (the same one who'd seated us) passed by and asked if anyone had helped us and took our drink orders. Later someone else (I think the other owners) told us about the specials. We then placed our orders.  The appetizer came quickly, but the food took a little longer. The guests at the next table looked over at us and asked if we had our food yet as they hadn't received theirs either. I am guessing that there may have been a miscommunication in the kitchen.  We received our food shortly after.  The owners made multiple attempts to turn the evening around as they sensed there was disappointment among the guests regarding bringing out the food.  He offered us free prosecco on the house and a free creme brulee.   I believe that intentions of the owners was for us to have a superb experience and I truly appreciate that.  All of the evening could have been smoother with just more communication among staff.  Sometimes it is not about being \"perfect\" with regards to businesses, rather to do anything to show that you appreciate the business of your patrons.  Having been a part of opening a restaurant before, I know there are small kinks here and there.  This place has a good start and plenty of potential.  Food 1) Cocktails: Well flavored and balanced.  Spritzletini was one of the drinks and I loved the presentation and flavors.  Nice combination of fruity and aromatic.   2) Appetizer Bruschetta: nice balance of fresh-fresh tomatoes and herbs.  Crusty Bread.  Also the bread basket with tapenade was amazing!!!  They refilled it for us without asking and I'm glad they did! 3) Caesar Salad: nice of the staff to split it into two bowls, going that extra mile. 4) Shrimp and Lemon chicken entrees: Shrimp was jumbo and plump, juicy and sweet.  Sauce tasted really good.  Medium sized helping of pasta.  Sauce slightly on the saltier side, roll out those margaritas....oh....wrong place :)  Lemon chicken hearty with lots of vegetables.   5) Creme Brulee: on the house - beautiful rustic chic presentation with meringue cookie.  Nice touch!  Mojo 1) Go for the ambiance, a nice place to spend the evening and catch up with friends (new and old).  Take a leisurely time and have dinner like they do in Europe: a night of conversation and finishing with cappuccino...and/or fruit/chocolates. 2) Get the cocktails, ask for the dessert menu.",

We were excited to try this restaurant since we'd heard great things about it but I will make sure everyone knows what lack of customer service is provided here!  I originally reserved a table days before to ensure our seats. Unfortunately they didn't listen to me when I told them the amount of people. When we arrived and they realized it was a smaller party they hurried us out of the original table we were seated at to move us to another. The way they rushed us like cattle was upsetting. The server was abrupt and lacked of personality from the moment he asked what we wanted to drink he acted as if we were a bother to him. The server and the owner treated us as if they thought they were better than us.  This is not fine dining! This is a local business so act like it! Treat people as you'd like to be treated. Las Vegas is known for customer service and this restaurant sure missed the mark.  As I was leaving I told one of the employees that I would be speaking to upper management and he laughed at me and let me know he was the owner. He sure didn't act like an owner, an owner would be sincere and apologetic and would try to improve the situation not antagonize the guest.  The only apology we got was from the hostess who mistakenly reserved for a larger party. It's too bad we didn't get to try the food here but I won't be coming back here or recommending this place. I'm disgusted with the way my family and I were treated.",

Wait staff is extremely annoying, constantly refilling water glass after each sip, or rushing to pull away a dish the second I finish my last bite. Here are some tips for all the non-Italian wait staff that get jobs in Italian-owned restaurants: this is not Olive Garden. Food is served in courses: antipasto, primo, secondo, then dessert and coffee. Do NOT ever remove a plate that still contains sauce. And for GOD'S SAKE don't ever bring the food all at once!!! Repeat after me: served in courses. C-O-U-R-S-E-S. Get it? Let the water glass be empty before rushing to interrupt the conversation to refill everyone's glass. What you think is being \"attentive\" is actually excruciatingly annoying. Get with the program or go apply at Olive Garden and serve unlimited breadsticks.",

Wait staff was very attentive and prompt.  We had a couple people in the party order bottomless drinks and they kept the mimosas and bellinis coming!!! You can get bottomless for $19 and choose between 4 different drinks or just order by the glass for $6.  They are all very tasty so a great way to start your morning.   They have a variety of options for brunch, most of the party ordered the steak and eggs or the lobster ravioli.   Food was delicious, my steak and eggs were cooked perfectly, seasoned just right and the ravioli that I tasted had a plentiful amount of lobster and shrimp.     A great touch to a relaxing meal was the saxophone player.  He's very talented and we're surprised he was able to keep going without a break during our entire meal.

I took my friends to dinner to celebrate my promotion, and we all wanted to go to a place where we can get overly-happy and make some noise. Well, we ordered the out-of-this-world tasty food and had our cocktails and wine and got loud and happy (thank you, friends!)...and then the Food came...and we all got so quiet....We all looked like predators over our plates. I ordered the Organica salad & the Scaloppine dish...and I surrendered to the exceptional taste. My fiancee ordered the Italian fillet mignon...Filetto di or al Manzo...and we waltzed in pleasure. I let my friends pick the wine...and, boy, mamma mia, what a finesse! Clink! An extra 3 miles of running next day was worth it for the scrumptious desert: Raspberry ...Bavarese al Fragole..! I truly, friendly recommend this awesome Italian restaurant. Take your significant other or others (LOL) and have an authentic Italian cuisine experience. Loved it! (it matched the quality of my promotion, haha! Vedi Prosecco e puoi ...mangia, mangia! Long live Italy!",

The decor is a fresh, clean and bright feeling, much more up to date than the old red and white, typically dark Italian restaurant. The food tasted very good. My husband had Caprese which was a step above the norm. I had the quinoa and hazelnut salad which was very nicely underdressed and had good flavor. The dipping oil for the bread did not have the taste of the herbs in it, and might have been better with some garlic or balsamic in it. The bread itself was very good. My husband had linguine with clams and loved it. I had a ravioli with gorgonzola and asparagus creamy sauce. The flavors in mine could have been more pronounced and the homemade pasta was undercooked. For dessert we shared a custard with strawberry coulis. It was not too sweet and a nice way to finish off with something light.  The service could have been friendlier, such as giving us their name and pointing out the special and fundraiser. Also, the I initial contact and bread were slow in coming. Water filling was prompt. Food service was prompt. Service overall had a hesitant feel, so perhaps this can be attributed to their being open only one week. One if the owners came and spoke to us, which was very nice.  We felt the prices were high, so we cannot go often, but we will return",

My husband had the Fettuccine Tocco and I had the Ravioli. Both were very good. There was also live music, which made the night even more enjoyable.",

It was green pasta (?) with an aftertaste of fish. I didn't eat even half of my dinner. I couldn't get past the fish taste. For dessert, I ordered their version of creme brulee. I don't know what I was served, but it was unlike any brulee I'd ever had before. It was served cold, and what should have been a crispy layer of caramel on the top was actually a layer of something greasy, like butter that had been melted, then poured over the brulee, then put into the fridge. I don't understand how anyone can screw up creme brulee, but this place certainly did it. No, I won't give it a second try.",

The reason for the two stars is when we ate the mussels in the Linguine Mediterranea, it tasted completely rotten. It was not edible and I immediately spit it out. It was so revolting we cannot even think about the seafood used in that meal.  The main reason I go to a restaurant is the food. So even though the service and atmosphere was pleasant, I can not look past the quality of the food.",

We were immediately sat, but it did take a minute for us to order our drinks (ordered a glass of Mimosa & The Venetian). We were given waters and shortly after our server took our order as well. We decided to try the Carpaccio Cipriani, Pizza Margherita & the Banana Nutella crepe.  I'm not gonna lie, I wasn't impressed at all with the Pizza Margherita - it looked delicious, but as soon as we both took a slice from the plate & all of the cheese slid right off.  The middle of the pizza was just drenched/soggy when we took a bite as well.  I'm usually not a fan of Carpaccio, but I did enjoy the dish.  The Banana Nutella crepe was delicious, probably my favorite out of what we did order. Our server was on point as well with his timing when it came to serving us our crepe while we were pretty much done with the first 2 dishes.  Also, I did appreciate that he didn't forget about my order I wanted to take home with me, but I wanted it towards the end of our meal so it wouldn't soggy.  Service was amazing!  They also had a live sax player while we were enjoying our brunch! Played some good songs too!",

I have been meaning to come here for a while so I was quite excited.  The bread and oil was good at the beginning and was actually a really good size.  Too much for the two of us.  I ordered a Cesar salad as an appetizer and that was pretty good but too pricey for what it was ($9).  My date had the Lasagna all'Emiliana and loved it.  It was a very good portion and very tasty!  I unfortunately cannot find what I had on the menu anymore so they either change their menu regularly (which is a good thing) or it wasn't popular.  Whatever it was, it was delicious and there was a lot of it!  Even if there wasn't a lot of both of our portions we would've been satisfied because they were so luxurious and decadent.    There are a lot of Italian restaurants in the Henderson area and although this is right over the border, I consider it close enough.  Many don't hit the mark but this place does.  I will definitely be back here.",

We went here just last night to celebrate my sister's birthday. She had the squid ink pasta with scallops and shrimp and, since it was her birthday, she added a lobster tail on top for good measure! My brother-in-law had the lamb with saffron risotto! Mom had the spaghetti with lobster tail. Hubby and I had the Parmesan cheese wheel prepped pasta with shrimp and truffles! The chef came out personally and kept shaving more and more and more truffles on it! It was MAGICAL! Then, to top it off, they came out with a delicious strawberry shortcake/cream thingy with a candle in it for my sister (free!). Thank you so much everyone for helping a special day be even more special!",

I'm actually addicted     Tonight I have to brag about my dish called the Ossobuco special. My taste buds are going insane at the moment. This dishPerfectly braised short rib, with a rosemary red tomato sauce, on a bed of saffron risotto. One word: Omg!   7/20/18 UPDATE: I went to another highly acclaimed  Italian resturant here in Henderson. I had their Ossobucco and at first bite, I realized I had become an Ossobucco snob for the rest of my life because of my experience at Prosecco!!! They use the finest ingredients and know how to cook it right with saffron (not cheap! But worth it!) The way to eat it is to first, break off a little piece of rosemary, with some meat, bone marrow and a little risotto. The flavors will melt in your mouth like a beautiful melody in your mouth. If you are lucky enough to have this on special, I can't recommend this dish enough! Overall, my Moral of the story is, you haven't had authentic Italian Ossobucco until you have had it at Prosecco.",

    "text": "A tasty little find. Not wow'd, but satisfied.  We had reservations for seven and arrived fifteen minutes early. The hostess invited us to sit at the bar, where the attentive bartender gave us a pleasant start for the evening. Our red wines, including the house \"Hanh,\" were both very good. A little past half an hour later (that's more than 15 minutes after our reservation - longer than anyone else's wait), we were seated.  Our meal began with the bruschetta. It was smaller than we imagined, but it was packed with flavor and the various textures kept our brains intrigued. Definitely something to try.  When we had asked our waiter between the two salads we were eyeing - the Ruby and the Caprese - he initially recommended the Ruby, but then remarked that the Caprese \"is a classic.\" We got both and although the Ruby was downright delicious, the Caprese was unremarkable. The heirloom tomatoes lacked flavor (possibly because we just had the bruschetta) and there was one leaf of basil, almost like just a garnish. The mozzarella, however, was creamy, fluffy, and sweet, so that was a small win.  By this time, I was already full, so I'm glad we only ordered one main dish - the cheese ravioli with asparagus sauce. After the delightfully complex Ruby salad, we were expecting something with a bit more depth. Yes, it was good - full of cheesy goodness; the gorgonzola made its presence known without being overwhelming. However, it didn't blow our minds and I think we should have tried something seafood based, which is what everyone else seems to order.  We wanted to try the tiramisu, but we were full, concerned that it wouldn't be worth it, and it had gotten late; our babysitter would be expecting us.   All in all, we're happy we went. It just wasn't our night - half of the food we ordered didn't live up to the hype. If we had a redo, we definitely would make some different choices.  Pros: Wine selection, attentive staff, and the Ruby salad Cons: Unnecessary wait without explanation despite having reservations",

    "text": "il migliore - the best.  Loved it and why did I wait so long to come here.  1.  This location, 21 years ago was an Italian Restaurant called Round Table Pizza. Ate there once and always wondered why it was always empty.  2. About 3-4 years ago, another Italian restaurant opened up, called Gabriela's Italian Grill and Pizzeria.  It had a nice decor, nice dessert area and a beautiful kitchen. Ate here twice.  3.  Today in the last year, Prosecco opened up with two guys from Italy opening it and I wanted to try it for a long time. It was THE BEST!  Food -  We went for lunch and they have some great lunch specials for a reasonable price that includes soup or salad.  However, I asked if we could see the dinner menu and if we could order from it.  Pulpo - For an appetizer, we ordered grilled octopus on a bed of couscous.  So tender and tasty was this octopus that I am not sure why I usually order Calimari.  this octopus was tender and juicy.  The couscous was perfectly cooked al dente and that made the taste just right.  Veal Chop - I decided to try the Veal Chop because I have been having this at other places and found it to be a bit hard to make.  Here, the Veal Chop is on the bone and incredibly juicy, tender and flavorful.  A nice cut of Veal on the bone is perfect here and where many places make this a bit tougher, you can tell that this was a quality meat cooked to perfection.  Osso Buco - I always order this as my go-to when available to compare Italian restaurant.  This Veal Shank has meat that falls off the bone and is so succulent and juicy that you cannot believe it is meat.  I am not sure if I actually chewed it or swallowed it.  OK, joking but wow, I was impressed.  When you get great service, with great food cooked amazingly tender and juicy, what more can you ask for as a great meal?  I say check the place out asap!  You will look up.",

We made reservations for 4 and the table was ready when we arrived.   The interior was stylish and the staff was top-notch.  We started with the Bruschetta VG, Carpaccio di Manzo GF(Beef), and the Carpaccio di Polipo GF(Octopus). It was all great including the octopus, which was new to me served as a carpaccio.  Moved on to the Minesttrone Soup, Caesar salads and the Heirloom Caprese.  We shared the \"Pasta in a Wheel\" which was fun. You are paying more for the show. $28 per person for a minimum of two people. But that came with 4 plates. Nothing really stood out other the show. $28 per person for Pasta, cheese and cream is a bit over priced. Like I said, it's fun and you should always order it once.  I had the Chicken Marsala which was wonderful. Another guest had the Tagliolini Neri al Granchio (seasonal) Black ink pasta tossed with Dungeness crab meat and roasted garlic in a light creamy sauce which was very tasty. There were just a few small pieces of cartilage in the crab which is expected.  We passed on desert but I can see coming in after a movie for desert as they look yummy.",

The sauce was sweet but did not taste like Marsala Wine. I make it so I know what it supposed to taste like. They should take it off the menu. The moral of the story is don't go to an Italian restaurant when you are on a diet. Oh and by the way don't order the tomatoes and mozzarella. The chef hide the top of the tomato with the mozzarella. I wouldn't call the cook a chef.",

I find that a bit preferential.  It makes a person feel as if they do NOT matter.   There is so much more to owning a dining place than ensuring the food is prepared properly -  because that attitude can ruin the entire experience and it did!!!!",

Me and my party was asked to leave by a hardly a American speaking over zealous wanna be Italian from as he said straight out of Venice  They have no class  I've been to 100s of restraunt in Las Vegas  and never treated so badly over not liking my entree They have a lot to learn. Unfortunately I think it's a lil too late.  I don't think they'll be around much longer. And the manager who acted like a baby brat over not liking the food  should think twice before acting like that to people   In Las Vegas I've seen a lot of horrible stuff happen over less than that not liking your dish.  This place leaves a lot to be desired   I would highly recommend not going here !! I know I will spread the word.    Horrible.  Just horrible !!!  He basically stamped his feet over not liking the food and screamed and yelled in front of many customers  normal etiquette. Would've been to kindly ask if I would like to make another choice from the menu !! Yelling and screaming with no class.  Very sad  I later found out from my waiter that he is part owner   Shame in him.  This is America not a small town in Venice   Shame shame Prosecco",

My place setting had a knife which had a dirty spot on it. I pointed it out to our waiter and asked for a clean knife. His helper came by to fill our water glasses and since our waiter never came with a clean knife, I asked her to replace it. This is mid afternoon and there are empty tables all around us so their is no excuse for a dirty knife to be on a table for more than a few minutes before it is replaced. There was a gentleman in a suit who seemed to be the manager and a young lady standing near the entrance so I got her attention and mentioned very calmly that I had already asked our wait staff for a replacement knife and nothing had been done. She finally got some one to bring me a clean knife just before our meals were served.  Now for the food itself. We had 5 different choices from the large lunch menu at our table. The pizza was not good with an oily crust and the lasagna was just okay. The chicken masala and eggplant parmigiana were tasty and the sandwich looked very good. The presentation of all the dishes was very nice but the food itself was just okay. We expected more from a restaurant of this caliber.  Our waiter did split the bills for us but got the two credit cards that were used to the wrong person. He had a 50/50 chance and blew that too!  This was the first visit for 5 of us who eat out a lot but won't be returning here.",

    "text": "I live in SE Las Vegas.  My sister and I gave it a try for lunch at 11:30am on Oct 3, 2016.    SPECTACULAR.  Ambience:  inviting, modern, hip, non-pretentious.  Best use of orange I've ever seen. Attire:  consider dressing casual with a bit more effort    :-) Menu:  much enticing variety. Food quality:  casual gourmet, noticeably fine ingredients. Food prices:  Very Fair.  Pasta entree $12.  Big soup $7.  Coke $3. Presentation:  Artistic, classy.  Probably the best you'll get in zip code 89123.  Service:  MUCH better than most LV restaurants.  Hostess - classy, warm welcome.  Server Juan Carlos gracious, professional, impeccable level of service.  The Chef personally presented our entrees, including a magnificent ravioli truffle special-of-the-day.  Juan Carlos and his assistant kept our drinks full, anticipated our every need, made appropriate menu suggestions.  Thank you for a WONDERFUL spontaneous dining experience.  My sister and I enthusiastically tipped 25% on this lunch.  The owner's attention to detail and quality is so important to him that the restaurant's business cards have his personal cell number on it.  I called owner Giuseppe moments ago to congratulate him on his marvelous dining offering, and he answered the call after two rings!  (He was mixing drinks at the time and was delighted that I called.)  And then he called me back five minutes later to add more information to the answer I was seeking.  How's THAT for entrepreneurial excellence!  I recommend Prosecco Italian cuisine for a bright and cheerful lunch with your sister, for a romantic afternoon or evening dinner date (with someone other than your sister), for a business lunch, or for any well-deserved meal in a casual setting but with first class service above and beyond what we Nevadans usually get at other equally respectable restaurants.  My next visit to Prosecco will be a date night.  I'll catch a 7pm movie next door and then go for a later dinner seating.  Caveat -- although the dining room stays open later, last call to place a dinner order is 10pm.  As of today (Oct 3) their website is not up yet.  But for questions, just call them.  Again, they're very gracious.  A very refreshing lunch or dinner experience.  They're newly opened.  Try it now while you can get a good seat -- it's a matter of time before their reputation makes them the new hot spot in the area.  Thank you for a superb lunch.  Johnny (with Jessica) in Las Vegas",

Even showed us around a little where their bar and wine room was. We definitely didn't mind coming back in 30 minutes and they did not disappoint! The food is so fresh and delicious! I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and it is SO good! The meatballs were moist and flavorful and the sauce was like simmered for hours. Waiters were all friendly and checked on us throughout our meal even when it got busy. I will definitely come back and try their desserts. Prosecco is located next to the Regal movie theater on Eastern and Pebble and it has outdoor seating as well. The decor is modern contemporary and it has a vibe of fun without being pretentious. I'm so glad this place has opened here. This will definitely be my new favorite Italian restaurant go-to.",

    "text": "I've tried this restaurant twice now, and the first time it was decent, but the 2nd time around I'm not so impressed. The location is nice, with pleasant decor and outdoor seating.  The tables and chairs outside are a bit cheap in quality, as they are wrapped in a plastic wicker cover, and they've decided to place an untethered seat cushion on each seat.  This arrangements is a bit frustrating on two levels, the seat cushions easily slide off and/or move so you have to be annoyingly cognizant of what you're sitting on, and, the plastic wicker table obviously has holes in it, so be careful not to spill anything as it will drip through and on to your pants/skirt/legs.  The Staff was courteous and friendly each visit and pleasantly accommodating. The reason I gave the review two stars is for both quality of the food and for lack of concern when the problem was pointed out.  We ordered the mixed cold cuts and cheese appetizer for two, which I would have expected generous portions provided since the appetizer was $30. Instead we got paper thin 4 slices of Mortadella (Italian bologna), 5-6 small slices of Prosciutto, and 4 slices of salami (ea. paper thin and the size of 50 cent piece).  There were 4 small cubes of cheese (unknown kind because the waiter didn't bother explaining what's on the plate), a dollop some marinated green peppers, a dollop of some marinated mushrooms, one small artichoke cut in half, and 5-6 Kalamata olives.  There's no way you convince me that was a $30 appetizer. I've had much better at other restaurants for half the price. (So I would recommend avoiding that at all costs) The quality problem was actually with that very same appetizer.  Parts of the Mortadella were dried out and had the consistency of a potato chip.  There's only one way that could happen, and that is the meat had been previously sliced and not stored properly, as the meat dried out and hardened.  When I pointed this problem out to the waiter, he said he would let the chef know about it.  Sadly, 10 minutes later the waiter came back as though nothing had transpired, and asked \"So, how was the appetizer?\"   Needless to say, neither the waiter, the chef, or management ever came by to address the problem with the meat.  I guess I was just expected to eat it and pay for it, regardless of how it was mishandled. The other issue I had with the dinner that evening was the timing.  After we got the appetizer, it literally took 35 minutes for the entree (pasta dishes) to arrive. So about 10 minutes to get through the appetizer and 25 minutes of waiting for the next plate. At the end of the dinner, as we were leaving, the waiter checked with us and said \"I hope everything was good\" and I replied \"everything except for the appetizer\" and his response was \"Yea, sorry about that.\"   Well, I'm sorry too, but my sorry is that I'm not going to be spending any more money there anytime soon. Overall, nice place, but needs some significant fine tuning.",

    "text": "Came here less than 40 minutes before they were closing and my boyfriend and I were greeted with the best service. I'm use to restaurants being extremely irritated when you dine in near closing, not this place. We were seated immediately and our server or servers (we definitely had more than one) came over timely to take our drink order. The place wasn't crowded but there was definitely a steady crowd for a Thursday night. While my boyfriend had wine I opted for just water so I can't speak on their wine selection but from what I saw they have a book full of different red and white wines. I ordered the Caesar salad and my boyfriend ordered the minestrone soup. Both were absolutely delicious. The salad is big enough for 2. I couldn't finish it by myself so we ended up sharing it. They brought out bread with some type of olive oil dressing/spread. Whatever it was, it was good. When I asked for vinegar as well our server kind of looked at me dumbfounded for a second and then brought out vinegar but with no saucer bowl. Idk maybe that's an east coast thing, olive oil and vinegar with bread. I had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was absolutely superb. The sauce was simple and delicate yet flavorful and the meatballs were big but not too thick whereas they end up dry in the middle. The meatballs were delicious down to every bite. Towards the end of our meal a gentleman who seemed to me as though he was the owner came by our table to check on us and ask about our meal which we raved about. This place has a romantic and sophisticated vibe. I love the design. The bar area has TVS which truly gives it a different vibe over in that area. Overall we enjoyed our food and will definitely return.",

I enjoyed the fettuccine with braised short ribs--a combination I've never seen before, and I'd go back for more tomorrow.  We met the chefs enjoying their own late night meal at the bar.  They're both Italian and well versed in the local eating scene.  Their motto, \"You eat what we eat.\"  And they eat very well indeed.    P.S.  Ignore any claims of poor service.  Marco (and Joachim!) made us feel as though we were in their own home for dinner.",

Modern bar and great patio.  The food shows a real Italian sensibility and flavor.   The owners are more than skinny jeans. A real love for the business and the desire to please. Nico is a great guy who hopes the draw of style and friendliness isn't the only draw....they want you to love the food.  Good ingredients aren't cheap and cheap ingredients aren't good.",

There is an open kitchen where you can see the cooks make fresh pasta and cook in the wood fired oven.  We had an appetizer of crostini with fresh tomatoes and ricotta served with cured meats. All the entree were cooked perfectly, my eggplant melted in my mouth. My roommate had the Cioppino and I got to taste some and it was fantastic.  They also have a happy hour that I glimpsed at the menu of and I'm definitely coming back for a $7 pizza and a $9 waygu burger!   This place will be a local gem. I can't wait to see how it grows!",

Very tight in the bar and the dining room. I am not a large person by any means.  But to walk to get to the bathroom I had to go through the dining area and turn myself sideways to get through.   It is like this throughout the whole place. At the bar were 4 younger adults two of the girls sharing a chair. They were fowl mouthed and loud. They apparently knew someone who worked there.  As far as food I will comment on what I ordered as it was awful.  I ordered the Golden Knights Special.  Consisted of 3 beef medallions in special sauce, giant prawn, potatoes and veggies. Let me tell you the beef was horrible. At first I thought it was the sauce. So I scraped off the sauce. Nope. Than I went to try the second medallion. Nope.  It tasted like rotten meat as well. The manager did come by and ask how the meal was but this was prior to me trying the medallions. He never checked back. I did mention it to the bus boy as he cleared my half full plate. He said sometimes we get a bad chef.  I guess I complained to the wrong person. After we left my husband said I should have said something to a manager which I'm surprised I didn't but just wanted to leave.   The prawn was huge and very good but as for that beef it left a rotten taste in my mouth all night.",

    "text": "My first time dining here was incredible, and I forgot to write a review so here are my two reviews for my experiences at Prosecco. (Yes I came back within 2 weeks because it was THAT GOOD.)   First time: They serve complimentary warm bread with pesto which is to die for. No shame that I ate almost the entire mini-loaf of bread and left one piece for my partner.  Ordered Burratina as an appetizer. It was delicious, fresh, and plated beautifully. The prosciutto was crispy and delicious. I could have eaten an entire meal of just that.  For my entree I had the Agnolotti alla Piemontese which was one of the best pasta dishes I've had in a long time. The ravioli were clearly handmade and the creamy truffle sauce was rich and flavorful. I made sure to use every last drop of sauce because it was so delicious.  We shared a bottle of Prosecco which was chilled and refreshing on a hot summer day. The atmosphere was nice and we had an amazing time dining here. The owner came to the table and we mentioned a hilarious review we saw on Google about a delivery driver hitting on someone's wife. We laughed while reading it, but the owner was distraught. He told us they use GrubHub for deliveries and this person was not affiliated with Prosecco at all and was NOT an employee. He was extremely sad that this bad review brought down his overall rating, which shows he cares about his customers and his reputation. He chatted with us a long while & offered us some Limoncello on the house.   Second time: We enjoyed our last meal so much we decided to come back for dinner again within two weeks of our last time dining here. This place is truly a hidden local treasure.  We once again ordered the Burratina (the fresh mozzarella and crispy prosciutto will have you coming back for more too, I promise.) I once again ordered the Agnolotti alla Piemontese because like I said before, I have not had such a rich and flavorful pasta dish in a long time. It may not seem like you get a lot of ravioli, but they are extremely filling and both times I could not finish my meal.  We shared a bowl of muchroom risotto which was probably the best risotto I have ever had. That is a bold statement because my mom makes awesome risotto (sorry mom). We DEVOURED the enormous bowl of risotto like it was nobody's business.  My partner had the Branzino fish which he finished so fast I wondered if he even took a breath between bites.   We love this place, it's one of our new favorites. We will continue to come back here for dinner. I have a feeling this is one of those places that no matter what you order, the food will be good. The staff are actually Italians at straight from Italy, the hospitality and service are amazing. Definitely recommend you give this place a chance!",

Their pasta is truly homemade we had the Fettucine Tocco which was ribbon pasta with braised short ribs unbelievably flavorful and the Agnlotti alla Piemontese a stuffed pasta filled with porcini mushroom and ricotta cheese with creamy black truffle sauce. AMAZING. I normally never indulge in pasta but this was truly so good and am so glad to of experienced what homemade pasta tastes like. Our appetizer was the octopus carpaccio and it was huge in portion and so delicious. The octopus was infused with lemon and a garlic sauce. To end our meal their dessert the Bravaresa al Prosecco a delicate Prosecco custard served with a strawberry coulis was light fluffy and the right amount of sweetness. Service is exceptional and our waitress Rhonda was wonderful. I highly recommend this place food-atmosphere and service was great",

Calamari wasn't crisp.  The batter felt too soggy in texture.  The sauce that wa served on the side was great and help add flavor and made the soggy texture bearable.  Veal:  4 stars.  Veal was tender moist and juicy. Risotto was okay texture wise,  it's the flavor of the risotto I wasn't used to.  I can't quite put my finger on it.  Maybe it was the taste of saffron.  Idk.  Overall I enjoyed it.  Margarita pizza:  5 stars,  fresh made tomato sauce from scratch really added to the freshness of the pizza.  The soft airy dough also make it enjoyable.    Lobster supreme:  4 stars,  lobster cooked perfectly.  Good flavors.  What you'd expect from a white wine tomato sauce linguine dish.  But it felt something  was missing.  A key ingredient to give his dish that \"BAM\"! Still a great tasting dish nonetheless.",

Clam Linguini  This was my husband's dish and he said it was good.  Kids Pasta with Marinara Sauce My daughter had this. The bowl was huge and we couldve split it between all 3 kids. She ate half the bowl and this is impressive for someone who doesn't eat much.  Kids Pasta with Butter Sauce Very flavorful. My baby had this and we had to bring leftovers home because it was such a big serving.  Kids Cheese Pizza and Fries LOVE that they put the fries on top of the pizza. My oldest only brought 3 slices home! She said it was delicious with ranch!   We will definitely be back!",

I ordered the Fettuccine Tocco - Rosemary infused fettuccine with braised short ribs. It was delicious. For dessert we brought home a slice of Tiramisu.

The inside is absolutely gorgeous and the customer service was amazing!  The pasta is made from scratch and when you taste it, it has a fresh taste to it. Very lite and fresh, which it was delicious. I had the ravioli with the asparagus cream sauce. I also sampled the chicken, and it was cooked perfectly. Everything I had here was lite, fresh, and not to heavy but with an absolutely amazing taste.   I will be returning here for sure. And A+ for the service, some restaurants it's hard to find how great of service it is here.",

The menu of set items were perfect and the many specials were fantastic. I had a pork special, which was cooked to perfection. The osso bucco was the best I have had since I was in Italy. The head chef, Daniel, made an appearance from the kitchen as we were finishing dessert. He is so sweet. They also do brunch with sweet and savory items on Saturday and Sunday that we are planning to catch soon. I highly recommend this place for its atmosphere, staff, and delicious food.",

The atmosphere is definitely appropriate for a date night or special occasion. The staff are super friendly and the owner even greeted us at the door. Our server was super funny and chill. I think everyone is actually Italian which adds to the authenticity of the place, it was cool to hear the different accents in the place, let's you know the food speaks to all people.  The menu is surprisingly extensive, the wife and I split the mushroom ravioli and the braised short rib pasta with red sauce. Sorry I don't remember the actual names from the menu, they were all in Italian, and our server pointed out how horribly I butchered his language (much to the humor of the rest of the table). I thought it was all fantastic, the mushroom ravioli seems small with only 8 pieces but was definitely deceiving, we agreed it was quite filling. The braised short ribs were cooked well and it was so umami tomatoey beefy good I definitely think I'll get it next time.  Drink menu looked good, cocktails beer and wine but we had after dinner plans so just split some coffee and gelato. They give you huge servings of gelato, definitely something to share!  I definitely recommend you try out Prosecco!",

It would be nice to sit outside in the fall/spring when the weather is nice.   Dinner begins at 3pm so we didn't qualify to order off the lunch menu. First bread was brought out. It was so crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, so good! The ravioli with the truffle sauce was the best, chunks of truffle in every bite. If you love truffle, this dish is for you. The scampi paprika had some very large shrimp and was also a great dish!   The kids pizza and fries is quite large, I wouldn't recommend it unless you have 2-4 kids to share it. The fries come on top of the pizza. It's a wood fired pizza and very thin crust.   For dessert we had the chocolate gelato. Also, large portion. But so delicious, tasted just like the gelato in Rome. The espresso was perfectly made as well.   The service was great. The restaurant is truly authentic Italian from what we experienced.",

After being moved we waited a while until we saw a server.   5/5 - We saw the Truffle Cheese Wheel Pasta and was impressed... Had to order it. It is a two order minimum. It comes with shaved truffles that didn't really taste like much. The truffle oil brought out more of the essence than actual truffles. I thought this would be a very salty dish but it wasn't that salty. I think that the cream sauce it comes with made it less salty. It was pretty good and better than when I had it last in another state. So I would say this is one of their better dishes.  5/5 - We also got the Chicken with Lemon and Capers. It was light and chicken was moist.   3/5 - The Linguine Mediterranean was average. Wouldn't order it again. Nice homemade noodles though.  4/5 - The Spaghetti and Meatballs was pretty light. The noodles were cooked perfectly and homemade. The meatballs kind of reminded me the taste of Vienna sausages. It was more on the pork and veal side than beef. It was light in color, almost white and very bouncy. The sauce was light and almost a pink color, as well.   4/5 - They brought out various Desserts and Lemoncello. The Lemoncello tasted housemade because it was very strong. The Tiramisu had a lot  of liquour, not my fav of Tiramisus. The Cannoli was nice and light, the shell was crunchy. The Strawberry pudding like dessert was light.  I would come back and try their other dishes and definitely get the Truffle Cheese Wheel Pasta again.",

They dim the light perfectly--just enough so you can still read your menu without putting it right in front of you face like a blind woman, and just enough so it still feels romantic. -The butternut squash ravioli is my go-to every time and you cannot go wrong there! -Their bread and spread is the best. -They gave us a free creme brulee last time and my boyfriend doesn't even like dessert but he told me it was SO good he was going to eat it all! Haha.  Any food lover needs to come here ASAP because it is seriously amazing and you need to experience it at least once in your life!",

Pizza is really like in Italy but you probably don't wanna go for that since there's a huge choice of other good food. Something impressive is Pasta in the Wheel (it's called like that because they prepare your plates in front of you in a big parmesan wheel), the Fettucine Tocco and the Ossobuco. I'm italian and when I want to feel home I go there... I went there for lunch too and had a burger. Pleasure to taste an American classic prepared with the Italian high quality. Super suggested!",

    "text": "So this restaurant is close by to my house and I've been dying to come here! A few weeks ago I came here with my friend to have an early dinner here. Upon entering the place looks open and airy. It was a busy night and we got a booth in the back area. The place looks nice and clean. The waiter we got we weren't crazy about. It looked like he was just doing his job ... not very personable or friendly. No smiles or anything. BUT the manager that walked around to each table was super friendly and personable! he seemed like he cared about his customers that comes in there.. making sure they are happy! Before we got our meals he was already at the table greeting us and being friendly. We enjoyed talking to him.   Okay so I ordered a cafe latte to start and enjoyed the drink. The bread with the oil dip sauce was so tasty! loved eating it. Anyways we asked about the specials and opted to order one.. the fettuccine pasta with a pink sauce and a GIANT shrimp cut in half was on the plate as well. Well when we got the plate.. the shrimp was overcooked... it was hard and dry. the pasta was okay but nothing amazing. We sent it back and the manager made sure they cooked it right this time.. he even said when he brought the plates in the back and cut into it...it was indeed overcooked. The second time they made it the shrimp was cooked okay.. wasn't overly cooked. The pasta dish we opted for alfredo sauce instead tasted kinda bland... nothing amazing. Overall for this dish i probably won't order again.   I was impressed with the manager on duty tho.. he knew we weren't too satisfied with the second dish and took 1 plate off our bill.  I honestly really wanted to like this place! i wanted to try so many other dishes they have on menu!! but this experience wasn't too great on food and service. The only great thing about this experience is the manager who was extremely accommodating to the situation. He was super nice and charming. He aims at making sure the customer leaves happy or at least not mad. His customer service skills is amazing. He was hands on throughout the night and just awesome! the 3 stars I'm rating this place is for him!   Overall I would say that I wasn't impressed the first time coming here but am willing to come back again to see if service will be better with different waiter serving me.. and if the food that i order next will be tastier! :) I look forward to coming back for a second dining experience and maybe i can change my 3 star to a 4 or 5 star the next time around!",

    "text": "On Saturday night we dined here with friends. The food was pretty good, but I'm still cringing at the awkward service.   This is obviously the hot, new spot. I made reservations for 6:00 and I'm glad that I did because the restaurant filled up quickly. OpenTable didn't show availability, but when I called the restaurant they took my reservation.  Let's start with the food since this was pretty good. To begin we were given a bread basket with a sauce that looked like pesto, but seemed to be made with olives. The sauce was tasty and a nice step up from the usual bread or oil for dipping.   I began my meal with the Ruby Salad. I really liked this salad and the portion was large, too large for me to finish. The beets were tasty, the salad dressing was delicious, and the goat cheese was the perfect amount to round out the flavors. The Scampi Paprika didn't disappoint. The paprika sauce had a nice flavor and I enjoyed the simple spaghetti served with the shrimp. My husband had the Salsiccia e Rapini all Cabrese (sausage) and he said that he liked the dish. For dessert I had the Tiramisu. It had a nice flavor and was okay, but it wasn't something I would order again.   It's not often that I say this, but the food was overpriced. The Scampi Paprika was five pieces of shrimp with spaghetti so $29 seemed a bit steep on this dish. Even my husband's sausage dish seemed overpriced at $18 for a sausage with broccoli. Starters and dessert prices were comparable to what other restaurants charge.  I'm sorry to say that the service is the main reason that I probably won't return. I wanted to like this restaurant since it's close to home and located in a parking lot that is simple to access. It started with the wine. Long story short, our friend asked if they had Moscato and the server said yes, but returned with Riesling in the hopes that she wouldn't notice. The wine was served by a different person which made the situation more awkward and he was rather pushy with trying to get her to take the wrong wine initially. He ended up backtracking and insisting he would take it back if she didn't like it, but he'd already pushed quite a bit by this point. Through the evening it didn't seem like we had a dedicated server. I've seen the team approach at other restaurants and it works, but here it just began miscommunication after miscommunication which made the whole experience feel awkward. At the end of the meal a gentleman came by to ask if we could repeat everything we ordered so that he could prepare our checks. What? Why didn't the person that took our order share that with him? It was, you guessed it, awkward.   Overall, the food was pretty good and we enjoyed the evening with our friends, but the service soured the overall restaurant experience.",

The food is interesting as it's more Italian (I.e. many pasta offerings rather than traditional hash and waffles) but still enough options for a brunch aficionado. I had the shrimp and lobster omelette and the person I was with had the salmon pasta. The pasta was devoured in a tasty vodka sauce and could have been a suitable dish for brunch, lunch, or dinner. The omelette seemed a little empty outside the seafood, but was good once the toppings of avocado and tomato were sort of mixed in. The bottomless was top notch and worth all $19 for sure. And the prosecco they use is very sweet so be sure to ask for additional prosecco for side pours to make the brunch more memorable. Prosecco is solid and with the patio seems a nice leisurely Sunday on many occasions.",

Today we were looking for a place to go for Sunday brunch. Several breakfast/lunch only places have opened in the area. While most of them are OK, none really distinguish themselves. It was a beautiful Autumnal morning, soI thought I would try Proseco because they have an nice outdoor patio area that is nicely separated from the parking lot. Made a reservation which they honored. To our very pleasant surprise, they had an outstanding jazz sax player on the patio. Really nice touch!!! The brunch menu has a good assortment of omelets and other standard brunch items as well as a couple of more traditional Italian offerings. I went with the Ocean View omelet. Loaded with shrimp, avocado, feta cheese, and some lobster. Yummm! Best brunch experience I have had in a very long time. I will be back.",

    "text": "Decided to bring my mom here for an early Mother's Day dinner since she likes pizza. It's a bit more upscale than I thought. We came on a Saturday around 5pm so I thought we'd be the only ones, but there was already a large group and the tables started to fill up quickly.   We ordered - Grilled octopus, served on a bed of couscous  - Ossobuco with a saffron risotto  - Asparagus with lemon and butter sauce - Pepperoni pizza with bell peppers and mushrooms added  My favorites were the veal shank and octopus. Both were so tender and seasoned just right for my taste. I wouldn't usually order asparagus, but my mom likes it so we ordered it. We both thought it was ok, but probably wouldn't order it again. The pizza was a bit salty for both of us and the crust was too thin...or maybe the topping was too heavy?! In any case, I prefer my pizza to be of the Unfloppy variety :) But it did force us to fold to eat it and look like we were from the east coast!   Service and vibe were quite pleasant, food was mostly good, but the bill seemed a bit high considering we didn't have any drinks. So overall I give 3 stars using my very scientific method of taking the excellent service and 2 out of 4 dishes (5 stars), and subtracting for the 2 out of 4 so-so dishes, price value and likelihood I'd be back for dinner (2 stars), making it a strong average 3 star.",

I ordered the eggplant, it was good, better than most Italian restaurants that either drudges it in breadcrumbs or doesn't season it well. This one was worth $14! It came with spaghetti as well!  The added bread with the garlic oil or whatever it was, was super delicious!!   We did order the banana Nutella crepe for dessert and it wasn't bad!

The pizza - the simple cheese pizza was absolutely delicious. The best crust - the foldable one ... like the ones I have had in Italy. But wait for it. The fries - the best fries we have ever had hands down ... the kids pizza was 12\" - more than enough for three kids or two adults to share even!  Also got the capellini with pomadoro.

Pizza was a good price for its size, chicken and I had the lobster/shrimp ravioli. Bread was also good :) my moms boyfriend got a coffee and he loved it. Also whatever desert they have us for my moms birthday was very good. I'll Be coming back :)",

Their soups, their appetizers (especially their octopus), their pasta, and their creme brulee (has a different name but you'll recognize it) - everything was delicious.  On top, everybody working here is nice and accommodating - I reserved a table for 18 this past Saturday for an event and they were very helpful and nice. We all ended up being half an hour late because of the event before and I was freaking out. I called and explained and I was very surprised how nice and accommodating they were. I will be back.

    "text": "I will preface this review with the fact that I am Italian and I am from Long Island, N.Y (roll your eyes, but the fact remains I know great authentic Italian food)..  Ordered delivery from this establishment this evening via EAT24. I have been dying to try it.. as authentic Italian cuisine is obviously up my alley, especially on days when I don't feel like cooking. Ordered a margherita pizza, calamari, and tiramisu. I figured the old standbys should give me a sense of quality with this place.  Delivery was 20 minutes earlier than the EAT24 app estimated. Great!  Everything should be hot then. Wrong!  Pizza and calamari were stone cold. Tiramisu was so-so.  I'm half dressed (Hello! Hence delivery), so I couldn't really run after the delivery guy.  I immediately put the tiramisu in the fridge and heat my oven to 500 degrees, in hopes of saving the pizza. While the oven was going, I attempted to place the pizza on my pizza stone and it was such a project because of how soggy it was. Still, I hoped that I could save it in the oven.  I start eating the calamari, which was edible and probably my favorite part next to the complimentary rustic bread (that's where your 1 star came from, thumbs up on the bread and tapanade). $13  When the pizza came out, it was even worse than when I put it in. I gave up and just ate it because I was so hungry. Flavor was \"eh\" on top of it. I make a better margherita pizza at home. I'm so disappointed and I was most looking forward to this pizza, I wanted to love it so much. $11  Tiramisu pictures from being served in the restaurant (posted by other Yelpers) show a nice, huge piece of my favorite dessert. That's why I ordered it at $6 a slice. My slice is the tinest piece of cake I have ever had from a restaurant.   With tip, I paid an even $40 for utter disappointment all the way around. But here's my tip for YOU, Prosecco.. if the quality of your food cannot be upheld, and the integrity of your product is at stake during the delivery process, DON'T OFFER THE SERVICE.",

This was like little bday surprise wrapped up in the lamb dish!! It was almost like lamb stew! White fish was good, they deboned it next to the table. Also meet stake was very soft and tasty. Vine list has good variety and ok prices for bottles.  Tiramisu was very coffee tasting! Let me not forget the bread! It was very rustic, original Italian ... anyway I liked it. Also there is some kind of dish for two, with big cheese wheel... they put pasta inside cheese wheel and they melt cheese inside... cheese wheel is like a big bowl ... I know it sounds confusing but I am interested and I will try it next time I am there!!!  I recommend this restaurant for all fudies!!! Enjoy!",

I ordered a bottle of Riesling and our server gave us great bottle service- showing us our bottle, letting me smell the cork, pouring it and allowed me to try it before continuing to pour the remaining glasses for the rest of the table.   For app we got the calamari and that was amazing.   For entree we got the golden knights combo, the lobster supreme, the spaghetti, and I got the special which was asparagus risotto with a paprika prawn.  The Golden Knight Combo has seasoned veggies, prawns and sirloin medallions served with a wine and bleu cheese dipping sauce. This was my dads order and he recommends that you dip the meats in the sauce!   The lobster supreme must have been really good if my Mom didn't offer us any and ate it all ( she's usually the Last to finish)   The spaghetti was good. It has giant meatballs on it and my sister really liked that about the dish   I had the special and this was different from what I order. The prawn was HUGE but the all star of the plate was the asparagus Risotto.   For dessert we got the gelato, in all three flavors, the creme brulee, and the semifreddo. All amazing! The salted caramel on the semifreddo was addicting and I couldn't stop eating it!   Service was great! I'm sad I didn't catch our server's name but everyone was on point in there.  Can't wait for my return visit!",

    "text": "Prosecco is a beautiful Italian restaurant, with a sun-drenched dining room and large booths for seating, and a glassed-in kitchen where you can watch the chefs hand-pulling pasta. Their welcoming patio makes me pine for cooler fall weather to return for HH, but we came for lunch.  They have a menu of lunch specials, which are slightly smaller portions at a couple bucks off of their dinner menu prices. We opted instead to order from the dinner menu, allowing us to try the octopus carpaccio and burrata apps- both were super fresh and beautifully plated, easily could have been my entire meal. We also shared the Fettuccini Tocco entree, featuring handmade rosemary infused pasta with braised short ribs in a red wine and plum tomato sauce. Even split, portion was large an though the meat was fork-tender the dish itself was somehow one-note as though missing something. We also had the semifreddo dessert with salted caramel sauce, which was one of the more interesting desserts I've tried at an italian restaurant. Glad they offer options beyond cannoli and tiramisu!  Though we were overall happy with our meal and the quality of food, the service was not quite up to par. Hostess greeted and seated us and the bartender/runner got our drinks and checked on us throughout the meal, they were great. Our actual server didn't make an appearance til 10 minutes after our arrival, at which point we were debating leaving. We never got an explanation for his absence and I also never caught his name, but he was overly casual for the price point and setting, doing the bare minimum. I suspect Nichole C and I had the same server. This makes me hesitant to return for dinner.",

    "text": "My better half and I were looking for a low key dinner date off strip tonight and we were in the mood for Italian. After a quick google search of \"homemade pasta Las Vegas\", I found a list that included Prosecco. After a quick look at reviews on Yelp and Open Table, I made a reservation. As we got to the restaurant, we were pleased to see ample parking since the restaurant is located in a strip mall type of area. The patio looked really nice but was empty (probably because it was still 94 degrees at 8pm) but I bet it would be really nice during cooler times.   The hostess was nice and seated us a table. The restaurant is dimly lit, perfect for a date night. I saw tons of families, too. A male server quickly greeted us and offered to get us beverages. We both got ice waters and I got Bocelli extra dry Prosecco ($10) and my husband got a Tanqueray and tonic (also $10). We were quickly brought a bread basket with the pesto anchovy dipping sauce right before our drinks were brought.   They accidentally brought me a glass of Chianti instead of Prosecco but Edith, our server, quickly fixed it and apologized and I assured her it was absolutely no problem.   My husband and I shared the lentil soup. It was great and the serving was HUGE. We both ordered the same homemade egg pasta entree: fettuccine tocco. It was rosemary infused fettuccine sauteed with braised short ribs in a red wine and plum tomato sauce and was priced at $20. It was a little bland to be honest.   We both got Parmesan cheese offered to our pasta which we accepted and it helped a tiny bit. Everything was fine and I couldn't finish all my pasta because the portion was so generous and I had already filled up on bread and soup.   Edith was always nearby to ask how we were doing and if we needed anything else. I also spotted the \"Italian John Stamos\" manager walking around.   We skipped dessert because we were so full.  I think we'll both be back to try a different pasta dish because there is potential.  Edith was great and was so sweet. I hope next time to save room for cannolis or the custard dessert.",

Upon arrival and being seated the server came over and asked us what we wanted to drink. No introduction or even a \"welcome to....\" never caught his name through the entire meal.   After water arrives we ask what he recommends to eat and offers meat more so than pasta instead of just maybe going over the most popular items, seemed off. We ended up ordered lasagna and the black squid ink crab pasta. Also, it was difficult to flag anyone down for a water refill or oil and vinegar as I don't eat olives that were in the pesto dropped upon arrival.   The food runner brings over the food and was very helpful and didn't recommend any Parmesan as cheese would destroy the crab in my dish but did offer black pepper. The lasagna was delicious and had a great smokiness from the wood oven and my dish was overly rich that I did have to take it home it was just too much.   The busser proceeds to clean off our table and asks if we want dessert and we decline. Minutes later, the server comes over and just hands us menus doesn't really say anything. Disappears again as we just wanted our bill at this point. He comes back many minutes later and finally can close out.   After this experience I would come back for lasagna but definitely hope for a better server, I'd take the food runner in a heart beat! But this is also a little farther than I normally prefer to drive.",

    "text": "We stopped in here for dinner this evening. We were immediately greeted by a young lady and shown to a table with no waiting. The place was not to busy. It appeared only 3 or 4 other groups of diners were in the place. It was around 5 PM  Rhonda was our waitress and she did a great job all night. Rhonda, as well as some of the other staff, were attentive all through our meal. We never had to wait to get a drink refilled.  Once seated we were asked if we wanted anything to drink. We ordered a glass of wine and a iced tea.  After the drinks were served we were asked if we'd like any appetizers. My wife ordered the bruschetta and I asked if they just had classic garlic bread because I didn't see it on the menu. I was told they did and they'd bring me some.  They brought my wife her bruschetta and a basket of bread and some oil which I assumed was the garlic bread. I wasn't a big fan of the bruschetta.  My wife liked it. The bread didn't seem very garlicky.   Just as I was talking about the lack of garlic flavor they showed up with the garlic bread. I wish they would have told us they were going to serve us bread because then we wouldn't have ordered the other breads. Our table looked like we were having bread for dinner LOL  Anyway the garlic bread was not what i was looking for. It was very moist and had hunks of garlic on it. It really didn't appeal to me. I had one of the staff take it away. Rhonda was nice enough to not include that on our check.  We both had the Capillini al Pomodoro for dinner. That's a fancy way of saying spaghetti with marinara sauce I think. We both enjoyed this plate.  For desert my wife had the Crema Bruciata. We both liked it.  I had seen strawberry crepes listed on the dessert menu on Yelp, but apparently they've been removed from the menu. I was really looking forward to them. I mentioned this to Rhonda and she said they could be made for me. They were great!  They did have some easy listening music playing, but it was down low and wasn't so loud that you had to talk over it. As we were leaving we noticed a guitar player tuning up in the corner. Apparently they were going to have some live music, but we left before he began.  The place is very open and roomy. It doesn't have that dark closed in feeling that some Italian restaurants have.  Our bill came to just over $73 before the tip. We had some of the less expensive items as we weren't really hungry and just wanted a simple spaghetti dinner. So it's a little pricey, but they do seem to go out of their way to make sure your evening is a pleasant one.   We both agreed we'd visit this place again.",

    "text": "Sometimes I find a gem while having a business dinner as is the case with Prosecco Fresh Italian Kitchen.  It helped that I know my business companion well enough so I was able to take pics of the food.  I did a bit of research and was craving something Italian ~ more Italian than Italian-American and this was where I found this restaurant thanks to Yelp.  Whenever I come to Vegas for business  (fun fact - I'm actually a NV resident and live here part time) I try to find some yummy neighborhood finds.  Their pastas are made fresh and they really have fresh good Italian food here.  We ordered the burratina appetizer and it was super fresh and delicious.  If you're into burrata cheese or fresh mozzarella, this is a dish you must order!  Bonus is the prosciutto was delectable as well.  For our main entrees, we ordered their Ravioli d'aragosta (shrimp and lobster ravioli in a light saffron cream sauce) - I'm always a sucker when I hear a dish has saffron in it -  and also their pollo parmigiana.  The raviolis were freshly made as you can tell by the texture of the pasta and the seafood seemed fresh as well.  The sauce was creamy but light at the same time and the saffron essence really came thru.  As for the pollo parmigiana, it was superb!  Huge piece of chicken with a side of pasta (I asked for capellini instead of spaghetti) and the sauce was marinara. Once again the pasta was fresh and it really makes a difference.  Service wasn't quite up to the level as the food but it wasn't bad - it's more of a testament to how good the food was.   If you're looking for delicious fresh Italian cuisine, I highly recommend this Italian restaurant that sits in a larger strip center off Eastern/215 fwy.  Please support small local businesses that go the extra mile.",

Upon entering we were greeted and promptly seated by the hostess. We ordered a glass of the best and only Chianti Classico wine I've ever had, Strada al Sasso. We then ordered lasagne and pasta cheese wheel with black truffles. The cheese wheel experience is amazing! And the pasta was authentic and the best I've ever had. The black truffles are very robust so I removed some of those. If this place was located near me I would dine a few nights per week. It has a fantastic ambiance and great staff.  I brought a friend here to celebrate her birthday. We ordered the ravioli ai formaggi, pasta cheese wheel and the fettuccine tocco. It was all good and my friend was happy.",

We ordered three lasagna dishes, one chicken parmigiana and one meatball sandwich.   The meatball sandwich had very little sauce but the very attentive waitress Rhonda brought extra sauce with the sandwich. My buddy didn't care for it so the waitress brought us a complimentary plate of cannolis as a surprise. FIVE stars!!!! Delicious.   ALL three lasagnas were homeruns on taste and size. I was full all day. I HIGHLY recommend the lasagna. Plentiful cheese, meat and right amount of sauce.   Chicken parmigiana was huge and good tasting per my buddy.   I rarely give five stars on one visit but this restaurant deserves it.   I'll be back and our old guy lunch group will be back. I don't even live on this side of town.",

We went on a Thursday night and had such a great experience there, the chef absolutely knows what he is doing and the front of house staff are very knowledgeable. If you are looking for authentic Italian food then this is the spot, we started our meal off with a Caesar salad and calamari. The calamari was excellent, great breading which was very light and seasoned just right. My girlfriend is a huge Caesar fan and gets this salad almost everywhere we go, she said this was one of the best dressings and I totally agree with her. For our entree's I had the Ribeye medium rare, the steak was cooked to perfection and was much better than any other strip steakhouses in my opinion, just salt and pepper seasoned so you are actually tasting the great quality of the beef. My girlfriend had the Linguine Mediterania under dry pasta's, they sure do not short you on seafood with this dish. Her scallops in the pasta could not of been cooked any better, they were like butter! Nico one of the owners was a very nice gentleman who made sure he stopped by every table to ask how things were and to tell a little bit about the restaurant which was very nice. Overall this was a great experience and we will most definitely come back. Next time I am going to try the pizza from their woodfire oven! Great Job Prosecco!",

The entrees were delivered at different times and mine was cold and had to be sent back.  Another in our party got cold food as well; but didn't send it back.  Probably because it took 5 minutes to get someones attention to get the food back to the kitchen.  Not a lot of flavor in the dishes combined with poor service and cold food....not going back.

The servers are courteous and friendly. And the owner himself visits the tables to ask if everything is okay. Food and presentation are good. The wait is reasonable time. We'd like to return and try other dishes. I think we're going to be regular customers.",

The menu selection and specials give you a wide array of Italian dishes.  The wait staff was very attentive. Giuseppe and Nico the owners are present and actively involved. The decor is simple and modern the open kitchen concept is really nice. The live music was a bit too loud but very good. Everyone that went in our party had different main courses and enjoyed them.  The desserts were amazing",

    "text": "First time visit and I LOVE this place! The food is exquisite, the prices are quite reasonable and the service is flawless! Giuseppe (co-owner) really took care of us when we went for Mother's Day dinner, making us feel like family, not just another table of patrons. He patiently guided us on our individual orders, including the bottle of wine (a smooth & tasty chianti). When I confessed that I couldn't decide between the filet mignon and the filet medallions with mushroom sauce (non mi piace il funghi), he suggested that I should get the tomahawk. Although I love a good steak, but having never heard of such a cut, I told him that I don't know what that is. \"It's wonderful. That's all you need to know,\" he assured me. When a server (or owner) of a restaurant boasts emphatically about the quality of something particular on their menu, I have learned that such advice is prudent to take. A tomahawk is a jaw-dropping sized hunk of beef at the end of an approximately 18-inch bone (I regret not taking a picture of it to show you before I dove into it.) And it WAS incredible, just as Giuseppe had promised. He told me that it had been aged for 80 days, but all I know is that it was absolutely the best steak I can EVER remember eating! I also got the ruby salad, which, if you like beets and goat cheese, you will love! My wife got the salmon in a lemon-based sauce with a prawn that arrived at our table looking magazine-perfect, and she said it was delicious. We also ordered the minestrone soup, which we thought was perfect. My brother ordered Branzino (sea bass) ravioli in a lemon butter sauce. Delicious, perfect portion. For dessert- Bavarese al Prosecco e Fragole (creamy delicate prosecco custard served with coulis) and another similar custard item, creme brulee, both of which were as outstanding as they were beautiful. There's something for everyone on this menu. I felt somewhat remiss in not ordering something more typically Italian, but I have no regrets about my tomahawk (other than not taking a picture of it). And I can always order something like that next time. Can't wait to go back! Grazie, Giuseppe!",

Friends had told us the food was great, the service was great and what a great host the owner was.  We were excited.  True the food was good, the service was good.  Our waiter Joaquin was terrific.  However, the owner, Guiseppe, was a great disappointment.  As we sat there I watched him go to every single table, sometimes twice, spoke to the guests and even sat down at some of the tables to talk and ask how everything was.  We sat there for a good 90 minutes and never once did he come to our table to see how the food or the service was.  He did visit the table next to us twice.   Our bill was over $100 so it wasn't as though we were just there taking up space and not ordering.  I was insulted.  My husband stopped to talk to him as we were leaving and told him that the food was great but that we had noticed he did not stop at our table and he had gone to all the others, he lied and said he \"was putting out fires.\"  We had watched him for over an hour as he visited each table.  We paid and left.  Never to go back again.   You only get one chance to make a first impression!",

I asked if they had a regular fettuccine Alfredo as I didn't see it on the lunch menu. They have it on their dinner menu so they were able to accommodate my request. When we got our food it was a generous portion and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!! You could tell instantly that the pasta was home made as it was light and airy. The sauce was a perfect creaminess with just the perfect hint of garlic (not over powering at all). My mom got their Tacchino Sandwich and again, it was a generous portion and all of the ingredients were a perfect ratio to each other.  The bread was warm and the cheese was completely melted and tasted like it had just come out of the brick oven. The restaurant atmosphere is clean and simple yet rustic decor. All of the staff was so friendly, it truly was a great experience. Mom and I cannot wait to bring our husbands to Vegas' new Italian gem!!",

My Lady and I had gone to the movies next door and afterwards walked down to Prosecco to see what their menu was like.  The decor and configuration of Prosecco invited us in, BRIGHT, COLORFUL, WELL LAYED OUT!.  We decided to have a late lunch/early dinner.  What a great decision.  The menu was impressive to read.  The food was fantastic to eat.  I ordered the Cappelini Pomodoro and my Lady ordered the Enslata Prosecco and we split the meals.  WOW, WOW, WOW!  The Cappelini was spectacular and the salad was fresh and delicious with lots of colors and flavors, just like the decor of Prosecco.  We sinned a bit at the end with a Cannoli for desert and that too was wonderful.  My Lady is 100% Italian and she was so happy with our experience at Prosecco.  We will be back for Round Two in the next week or so.  Hope to have a similar experience.",

A step above a steak you would get from a bar when ordering steak and eggs. It was 38 $  they need to take off the menu. Terrible. The first time went I got the 8 oz shrimp special.

Great place to take a date out or go with family. Will be coming here alot. Definitely recommend :)",

    "text": "In our adventures in new-parenthood, we decided to meet up family for a dinner out at this new restaurant I'd just learned about through them!   Atmosphere - the decor and atmosphere is very warm and inviting here. Everyone was buzzing and enjoying their dinner on a Friday night, that's for sure! The waitstaff and hostesses were very friendly and accommodating as best as they could be. We did have the baby in a carseat and ended up keeping her in the booth to avoid her being tipped over with narrow space between tables. The booths were just a tad too small for 2 people and a child.  Food - The food was awesome. I had the chicken with lemon sauce and capers. It came with very fresh baby carrots and green beans and had the perfect balance of savory and tangy - it was around $21 which seemed fair for the portion size. My husband had the ravioli which seemed to be a pretty small portion for $22. My family had pasta dishes that they enjoyed. We all shared the mango salad and the quinoa salad which were both very fresh and delicious and reasonably priced around $9.  Overall we enjoyed our dinner out here. The owner came around to the tables to welcome everyone and our server was very polite and friendly to explain everything  It may be a hard place to bring kids or a baby -- it's more of a restaurant for a friends night out or a dinner out with your sweetie -- it's not super quiet though, so don't try to have a super romantic dinner here on a busy night.",

I hope they get more bushes and trees to block parking lot and give it a garden-type ambiance.  Lunch included margartia pizza and salad w/mango - both very tasty.  Mango was delicious, butter lettuce & avocado fresh.  Pizza had the right amount of cheeze, not too salty. I also received a tray of oil & chopped basil & fresh warm bread-- both delicious and aromatic. I put the basil-oil mixture on my pizza. After lunch, sat at bar. Two big TVs for your watching pleasure.  Wide variety of drinks and good wines.  Beers on tap.  I liked the red chandeliers over the tables near the window.  I am looking forward to my next visit.",

As soon as we walked in, the hostesses were warm and welcoming. The restaurant itself is modern and sleek, and very clean. Our server was amazing. He was knowledgable and kind and did everything he could to make sure we were okay. I loved the fact that all the wait staff and managers were italian, from Italy, with their beautiful accents. I ordered the seafood linguini, which was delicious, and had more seafood than I would have expected. My date ordered the cheese ravioli, which was also very good and flavorful. We also had calamari, which I am extremely picky about, but this was perfect. This place is a hidden gem, and I will absolutely be back.",

The menu is amazing from pizza to homemade pasta but, I stuck with a favorite of mine.. eggplant parmesan. It was to die for! The ingredients were very fresh, the tomato sauce was bright and extremely flavorful!  We ordered a bottle of wine and neither my wine nor water glass were ever empty, the wait staff was on point. Rhonda was our waitress and was very helpful and kind. However, all of the wait staff assisted us, they seemed like a very functioning machine working together. Great food, amazing service and an extremely cute and comforting decor made for a wonderful dinner and I will be returning!",

My wife and I ordered a Margharita pizza and cannelloni. The latter was fantastic and served in a very generous portion. The pizza's toppings were first rate, the crust a tad soggy, perhaps, because we ate it after eating the cannelloni. One of our friends had spaghetti and meatballs. He gave me a slice of meatball. Fantastic seasonings! The flavors all hit the right notes in this restaurant.",

It appears they are coming out with a new menu and looked liked they were adding some additional great stuff. Can't wait to try more things on their menu! I only regret not taking pics to share with you; next time :)! If you live in Henderson and want to try something new and other than a chain restaurant, check them out.

Having friends that recently became employees there, my husband and I decided to give it a try.  Arriving around 9 we were immediately seated. Red shade lighting hangs overhead and setting is slightly intimate.  Cocktails orders placed and add bruschetta, the cocktails came and were stiff, bruschetta on crispy Ciabatta with delicious yellow and red heirloom tomatoes with a zesty seasoning was a good start to the meal. Food ordered, squid ink spaghetti and prawns, and Chicken Marsala.  I'd requested the prawns in a spicy fra diavlo sauce which he said he could do, however when it arrived it was essentially plain tomato sauce, totally void of any sort of heat. The prawns were huge though, I must say. My hubby's Chicken Marsala was pretty tasty, accompanied with baby carrots and a handful of green beans, artfully arranged on a long rectangular plate.  Service was attentive and friendly. The owner (I think he said his name was Giuseppe) came over briefly and introduced himself. Dinner minus tip was $122. Kind of steep for two at a strip mall Italian place, but I would consider returning. I like supporting small mom-n-pop places.",

    "text": "We were anxiously awaiting this restaurant to open where Gabriellas used to be.   The food-4 out of 5 stars. The owner is from Sicily and the chef is from Venice. So I guess we can call it Italian fusion if fusion can be used as a replacement for over priced. Sauces are very good but for what you get it is not worth the price. The over priced food can possibly be the downfall of this place because I do not see many return visits for that reason.  Service-3 out of 5 stars. Our waiter was eager to please but had zero knowledge of what was available from the bar and I had to get up and walk to the bar to see what beers were available on tap.  Ambience-1 or 2 out of 5. Far from a quiet or possibly romantic place for a quiet dinner. High ceilings and kind of loud. I normally like and get a good feeling when the owner is present,this place the exception. The owner Nico interrupted our dinner conversation twice and he comes off as a bit of an arrogant prick in skinny jeans. When he talks to you it feels like he is talking down to you and I don't think the employees respect him but they are certainly afraid of him which makes for a very uptight feeling amongst the staff. I think he would be better served staying in the kitchen and keeping things running smoothly from there and find a nicer restaurant rep for out front.  We will return but not often because of the prices.",

I had the special which was a whole Dover that they deboned table side.  We also had the  fresh home made ravioli stuffed with lobster. Oh my lord my palette was dancing with joy.

I don't like to leave Green Valley and am getting very tired of the district and don't want to go near eastern(this is between pecos and eastern) on Pebble.  Love the Patio, why don't more restaurants realize people move here for the weather? I live to dine Al Fresco!!  It has a very warm, welcoming vibe, great energy from the staff, a True Italian run restaurant.   Service was excellent but not stuffy or pushy. Our food came out in a timely fashion, the quinoa salad with hazelnuts and blueberry dressing was an exciting new twist,so sick of the ceasar salad and caprese salad. There is so much more to our culture than these cheese laden salads.  Our chicken dish didn't come out drenched in wine and butter, it was light and flavorful.   I'm definitely going back this weekend as they invited us to come and hear the music, and I have to try one of the homemade pastas. I cant wait!     If your looking for a casual, healthy, Italian restaurant with a modern vibe... Prosecco is it!!",

They also do have vegetarian friendly food too! And gluten free. It's a very modern food type Italian when it comes to health concerns which is the best thing ever. The raviolis my mum got and she finished them and she never finishes them! Anyways. Hands down amazing. Can't wait to come back for dinner and get down in food.  The olive oil bread dip does have anchovies, so if you don't eat meat, be ware, but mum said it was amazing!!!  Love this place already. Thank you for such amazing food and service!

The owners were there, greeting everyone and answering questions. It was a little noisy inside. Maybe next time we'll sit outside.",

Being a pasta fan, I just had to check this restaurant out.  Service wise, my boyfriend and I had a bit confusion when we asked about the specialties and menu items. The server has a thick accent so it was more like a language barrier but I can tell he knew his menu very well. It wasn't a big deal at all. The wine list was all reasonable priced too so we couldnt miss out on a drink.  We ordered three entrees-  Canellonni Gratinati: Very cheesy oven baked pasta. We wanted to order the alfredo but went for this instead. It was equally delicious and we did not regret ordering this instead  Bianca San Daniele: Pizza with proscruitto, arugula, and truffle oil. The hint of truffle oil was great. We had left overs so we took it home. 2nd day pizza tasted much better.  Lobster Supreme: Lobster seafood pasta!!! This one was devoured first. The lobster tail was soft and tender. I am not a pasta expert but the pasta noodles were so soft and yummy! Cant beat house made noodles.  Creme brulee: My boyfriend said he was stuffed and cant eat any more. Guess who ate more because it was delicious.... (yup). I am not the biggest fan of creme brulee just because sometimes it tastes way too sugary or you can taste the vanilla extract a bit too much but it wasn't overpowering at all! Perfect for my little sweet tooth.",

We had the Bianca San Daniel pizza for appetizer that was FOODGASMIC, my favorite. Thin crust with mozzarella, mushrooms, truffle oil, prosciutto, arugula and sliced parmesan cheese. Definitely a must try and I will be back for.  I had the fettuccine tocco, short ribs that melt in your mouth its so tender and pasta with what tasted like the short rib sauce. It was good. My husband had the lasagna, he liked it and to go we took home spaghetti and meatballs for our son, it wasn't his favorite but still good. I cant wait to go back for the pizza and try some more dishes.",

The whole experience was awesome. We had the Calamari Dorati for our app - so good! Everyone loved their entrees. FIL had spaghetti and meatballs and remarked several times that he liked the smoothness of the pasta sauce vs the tartness you usually get. Husband got the Ravioli d' Aragosta and he was in heaven. He offered me a tiny bite and it was delicious - strong on the shrimp and lobster flavors, which isn't always the case. Our 10-year-old got the pepperoni pizza, which was nice and large. She wasn't a fan of the pepperoni they use (it's not the red circles that you're used to), but the adults thought it was very good. I ordered the Agnolotti di Zucca and it was life changing! The combination of the freshly made pasta, the butternut squash and ricotta filling, and the butter sage sauce was phenomenal. The sauce was beautiful.   Husband and I had a date night 4 days later and came back to Prosecco. It was PACKED on Saturday night, so don't forget to make a reservation! We got lucky and the owner seated us at a table in the bar area. Husband ordered the Ravioli d' Aragosta again because he loves it so much. I ordered the Ruby salad. I could live on that salad! It was delicious.",

An experience it was.  The service wasn't quite what I expected.  We didn't have a definitive waiter.  Many gentlemen stopped at our table during the evening.  It was unsettling when we had to repeat our order at the end of the evening because he didn't know who ordered which entree.  It was also unsettling when I ask one waiter if they offer Moscato and he says yes.  A different gentlemen comes back with Riesling telling me it's the same and they don't have Moscato.  I reluctantly took the Riesling but the magic act was unnecessary.    For my meal I started with the Caesar Salad.  It was a very large portion I which I could share with my husband.  Great flavor with freshly shaved Parmesan was delicious.    I also opted for the Stuffed Salmon.  Well, you could probably just name it salmon because there was very very little crab stuffing.  The fish was also over cooked. It was not a dish I would recommend.    With a competitive restaurant town, I would've hoped for a better presentation.  A three hour overpriced meal left me underwhelmed.",

So we asked if there was a way to get spaghetti and they accommodated us! I Couldn't have asked for a better experience! I highly recommend this place. The food is incredible. Thank you Chef for making my mothers day! Nicco was so helpful and our waitress Rhonda was great!!! Highly recommended!!",

What kind of Restaurant has their hostess begging for tips from takeout orders? Also i brought the food home and the oil for the bread was opened and leaked all over everything and the Pasta was just cold and horrible and bland again. The customers that come here obviously know nothing about real italian food. If you want real italian amazing pasta try Chef Marc's.. his food is amazing.",

I made reservations a couple weeks in advance for 2. We were celebrating our anniversary and decided to try some place new.  From the moment we walked inside, we were treated like royalty.  The hostess greeted us with a huge smile and one of the owners welcomed us to the establishment. It was an uphill experience from there.  We drank and ate with gusto.  The staff was attentive and made sure we were set.  The lasagna and scampi paprika were fresh and delicious. My favorite part of the meal was dessert.  The tiramisu was the best I've tasted in Vegas. Hands down!  Their espresso martini paired wonderfully with the dessert.  If that wasn't enough, we were presented with 2 limoncello for our anniversary.  It was a sweet gesture. The other 2 owners (one of whom is also the chef), came out and greeted their patrons throughout the evening.   This was such a wonderful place to enjoy an amazing meal in a warm, classy and welcoming setting.  We will definitely be returning!",

On our first visit we ended up walking out after no one ever came over to us after being seated.   I only returned because my mom chose Prosecco for mothers day brunch. We arrived right on time for our 10:30 reservation. We asked for 11:00 but were told it was overbooked. Needless to say there were many open tables the entire time we were there.   We were seated quickly and had our water glasses filled. Again it took quite a long time for our waiter to come over and acknowledge us. He took our drink orders and said he would be back for our food order. Someone else brought out the drinks while we watched our waiter visit many other tables. He did finally return. My mom ordered the strawberry crepes and I ordered the \"benny and the ham\", their play on eggs benedict.   The food took a while to arrive, but that was expected for mothers day brunch. Although my mom enjoyed her crepes, my dish was absolutely terrible. Overcooked eggs on top of bland potatoes and the most dried out overcooked piece of ham I have ever eaten. The poached eggs were cooked completely through. Our waiter never returned to check on us and see how the food was or ask if we wanted drink refills. Dirty dishes sat in front of us long after we were finished.   After two very disappointing visits to Prosecco, there won't be a third.",

Reservations are intended for dining room seating. There were other open tables but the hostess said they were reserved for other reservations. She made it sound like we were walk in customers or that our reservation was less important than the others. The hostess kept claiming they were fully booked, but they were still taking reservations on the Open Table app!  The first time we were here, the food was excellent, but service was extremely slow. It took over 2 hours and we are fast diners. After this attempted visit, it seems they need to improve service all around.  Disappointing because we live 20 minutes away and drove all the way here, only to leave and go somewhere else.",

That can happen with a management change.   First, turn the music WAY down.  The interior is very pretty but with high ceilings and full house, it *is* noisy.  Combine that with SANTANA on the speakers and we were leaning in to talk.  Second, our server was efficient but had a bit of an attitude, meaning when we commented that the Pinot Grigio seemed unusually sweet, she promptly contradicted us, saying it was not sweet (!?).  OK, that was uncomfortable.  Third, the meal was good but not outstanding.  Our party split the check 50/50, and left, leaving a nice tip despite the apparent adverse changes since we were last in.    But wait, there's more!  We were *in the car* leaving when the host came running out into the parking lot yelling there was problem with our check and the charged amount was incorrect, meaning my portion was UNDERCHARGED!  Can you imagine an 'upscale' establishment chasing its customers around for an additional lousy $20 bucks outside claiming they owed more the meal, after the restaurant had made the mistake in the first place?    Then, the real jaw dropper:  as I was signing the \"revised\" check, the server (who also chased us into the parking lot), asked if I was going to re-add the $10 dollar tip.  This was after she screwed up the bill and chased me down for it!  You can't make this stuff up.  Isolated experience in an otherwise good place?  You be the judge.  I'm not going back.",

My husband and I sat at the bar for a drink before the rest of our party arrived.  We were there early enough on a Saturday that it wasn't too busy.  The bartender recommended wine, and I loved what she let me taste- a special reserve Chianti.  The second time I went to this restaurant, I had Prosecco which was also great. We had the burrata cheese appetizer and carpaccio which was excellent.  The entrees were all fantastic- and desert was even better.   I love that the owner/chef walked around to talk to people, and the bussers/waiters were friendly and attentive.   If you are looking for authentic Italian, off the strip, this is the place to check out.  I will be going back!",

    "text": "Seriously authentic Italian food. I knew the owners must be Sicilian and Southern Italian because their special was pasta with black ink sauce- very Sicilian. Then I overheard a conversation in Italian, and finally heard my favorite Italian pop star, Jovanotti playing in the background. With all of this observed as I sat down I asked for a Moretti and wouldn't you know it- they have it dark and light and on tap.   I really didn't even need a menu. I had to try the calamari and eggplant. Eggplant is my personal  test that soooo many Las Vegas Italian restaurants fail. I am a Jersey/New York transplant who had a 100 year old grandmother from Calabria cook me meals every weekend until her death. I am not easy to impress.  The calamari was perfectly cooked, my son loved it and their red sauce was spicy but not crazy hot. The eggplant was done the right way- not some crazy California interpretation. It was just a little mushy in the center, but eggplant parm is not easy.  The gelato and cannoli were excellent! The menu said Sicilian cannoli and it does the island proud. The service was very good, very friendly and I look forward to returning with friends and family.   Mille grazie, Prosecco!",

I've been here two times before and something's always been a little off but it wasn't worth mentioning. But today will be the last time I ever step foot in this restaurant. I decided to stop in for lunch, I had the Caesar salad to start and it was terrible. Oh my gosh the lettuce was wilted, yellow and a little red I was actually scared to take one bite. I couldn't believe they would try to pass that off to anyone but nevertheless things happen so it wasn't the end of the world. What bothered me was the servers reaction to our concerns and also that it was still on the bill at the end. When we mentioned it he seemed so irritated. Also, being here previously I was expecting the delicious complimentary bread and olive oil but it never came and I never mentioned it because I assumed that it must be just for dinner service. I was really disappointed when I saw that the two tables beside us were offered the bread. Maybe I'm looking too much into it but words can't describe how this type of service can make a person feel, was it the way we looked, the way we were dressed? I don't know, but being in this industry myself, I expected so much more.",

But I was able to convince them to step out of their comfort zone to try a new Italian place in our neighborhood. Unfortunately, Prosecco didn't do enough to earn our return business.   Service was friendly but slow. Waters sat empty. Drink orders were forgotten, came out wrong, and then to add insult to injury - double charged. Since it took 40 minutes for our food to come out we were now hungry, thirsty and annoyed. The kids love to play restaurant where they stand at the table and \"take our order.\" Despite half the tables having kids with them, the owner came over and asked \"are these yours?\" (Our children) and then lectured us on how unsafe it is for them to be standing where waiters may be walking.  It's a shame because the meatballs and calamari were both quite good. Clam linguine was pretty light on clams, including multiple shells that came out empty.  I want to cheer the arrival of an upscale new restaurant but they left too much to be desired and worst of all left us feeling unwelcome.  Ps over $100 for an appetizer, a side, an entree, a kids meal and wine.",

Introduced himself, memorized all the specials, and made some great recommendations. After snacking on the homemade bread or food was ready in an instant. You can taste the love that was put into the food like it was your own mother! Every bite was better than the last. While enjoying, the owner stopped by to check on us and made sure everything was going well. To end the night, we had Crema Bruciata (highly recommended) and Limoncello to finish it off. Everything was very reasonably priced for what you are getting. On our way out the owner thanked us for our business and hoped to see us again. Well my friend, you will.   If you are looking for a great Italian kitchen, look no further. This place is relatively new, but seems like they've been doing this for years. A+ service, food, and atmosphere!",

When we walked in, we were asked if we had a reservation. We did not and didn't think we needed one. The restaurant was less than half full. We were seated and no one came to greet us for at least 10 minutes. Finally \"someone\" came over and asked if we wanted drinks. I say \"someone\" because we were never told his name. It took a while to get a coke, iced tea and a water. At this point it started to get busier so we ordered. We had the calamari appetizer. It was good. Our meals included lasagna, eggplant parm & canneloni. Decent sized plates except for the lasagna. It was not thick and was more flat and long.  The taste of the food was decent. Prices were a bit higher than average.   I paid great attention to the details and the surroundings. As the place filled up, 2 men walked around introducing themselves and spending time with each table full of guests. No one came to our table. We had to ask for refills on the water and eventually the other drinks.  It is a cramped setting. Too many tables inside along the front area. Perhaps the tables (for 2) along the windows shouldn't be there. The guests had trouble getting through the table area and the servers certainly had difficulties as well. We had approximately 1 foot between our table and the one next to us - I felt like I was on their date with them.   Plenty of wait staff, but seemed to be still learning since they weren't very attentive.",

I had the Pollo Limone e Capperi and It wasn't very lemony and while there were capers I couldn't really taste them.  I also had the tiramisu for dessert and it was soggy so i couldn't each much of it.  A good thing was the service was pretty good, they were attentive and very nice however there weren't many people in the restaurant so I'm sure if their attention is due to the lack of customers or if they're normally like that.",

Highly recommend the detour.",

My seafood linguine had a lot of seafood, all very fresh except for mussels which tiny and rubbery(over cooked?).  Daughter had cappelini with shrimp...very standard.  Hubby had spaghetti with meatball.  Meatballs were huge but not what we're used to...it was very grounded with a lot of breading and barely had any taste of meat.  Excellent and attentive service.  Would definitely come back and try other dishes.",

Service took alittle too long for my preference, getting our meal took longer than 20 mins I think, maybe they are fresh made to order ? Not sure. Would not suggest ordering the Bututa Chicken, it's expensive and flavorless with some arugula on the side. My husband had to put my sauce from the cheese ravioli on top of it. The strawberry crepe wasn't the best either- too thick to be a crepe and the strawberries inside were not fresh and soupy. The special chocolate berry mouse was good on the other hand!",

    "text": "This is a great little Italian spot in Henderson right by 215. It has a good sized patio as well as a very modern feel to it on the inside. The managers and wait staff are very friendly as well. We tried the Burratina as a starter and it was excellent. It was a cripsy crostini, some burrata, tomatoes, greens and a balsamic glaze. I would say that i would have liked more tomatoes as there were only 2 small ones for the whole plate and maybe add some of their great tasting homemade pesto that they bring to the table to start with bread. For main courses we tried the 4 cheese ravioli which had good flavor and the pasta had great texture. The chicken parmesan was good, although nothing that special and could have used a pinch of salt. I would have also preferred freshly chopped basil on top to just the simple placement of the basil leaves. Overall, fairly authentic Italian food for decent value and great service. Solid 4/5",

As you can see from my other reviews, I am rather picky and snobbish when it comes to food because of my 30 years executive Chef credentials.
