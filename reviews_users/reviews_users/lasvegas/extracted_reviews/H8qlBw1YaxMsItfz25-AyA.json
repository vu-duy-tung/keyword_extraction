    "text": "I came here for a little snack to hold me over until a late dinner.  It was a beautiful day outside, and John Cutter allows you to enjoy it with their patio seating.  Yes, you'll be staring at a parking lot and a Wells Fargo in the distance...but still.  You're outdoors!  We ordered three dishes: Dynamite Rolls, Tuna Chips, and Chips and Cheese dip.  We also got a few beers; $4.50 for bottle of Blue Moon.  The Dynamite rolls looked tasty at first (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA?select=sKG7B9Wk9bFW38elaImoWg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/H8ql...</a>), but the inside was dry (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA?select=Rs3wXSXCrG25KCt-byTB6Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/H8ql...</a>).  The chips and cheese dip were nothing special, you'd do just as well buying a jar of cheese dip at the grocery store.  The Tuna Chips were the highlight of the evening (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA?select=4Hjf-6pu_h9oJfmAcgyBUA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/H8ql...</a>), with each chip coming with a nicely sized slice of tuna, slightly seared and topped with a soy glaze and little drop of wasabi (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA?select=zpSLxFrufBEa0Tp_qrtc4Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/H8ql...</a>).    With my limited tasting of John Cutter's offerings, they've earned themselves an A-OK.  I'm sure I will be back to try their other dishes!",

Two of the employees followed each other around like puppy dogs. They where straight up groping each other in front of everybody. They would wipe tables together and he kept reaching across and touching her chest. I get that you might be flirting but That's just not good employee behavior. And then one of the employees loudly shouted \"F*CK OFF\" in the back towards the end of our meal. All in all the food was way too expensive and then quality just isn't there. Won't be back here.",

My buddy had one beer. Only reason I mention that is because sometimes at that type of establishment i find if you're not really drinking you don't get treated so great. That was not the case last night. Our waitress was excellent. Always checking to see if I wanted a soda refill or if we wanted water. And, she was friendly. I'm not quite sure why so many negative reviews.   We didn't put a penny in a machine or drink but had one beer between 2 people and some food. Food was good. Service was good. For a Wednesday night it was surprisingly crowded.",

When you have to send your wife's steak back three times (just to attempt to get it to \"Medium\" there is a problem...inedible, just take it away.  When the manager comes to your table and his explanation is \"you know, sometimes we just seem to 'kick it down the road'...\" WTF?  when your water glass never gets refilled, ever --- and finally when the bill arrives and you see that you were charged full price for everything \"except the steak you sent back & never even had the opportunity to eat..\" Literally, that is a quote.... It's time to move on.  The food is generally good and some of the staff is awesome, but seriously, I'm on a mission here to help people find other places to patronize, not a place that patronizes you.",

Was told by the INCREDIBLY RUDE hostess that they were no longer taking tables for the night due to the kitchen being so backed up on ticket times....ok, disappointing but understandable. What's not understandable...the hostess rolling her eyes and acting as if I'm bothering her when I ask her if there's an eta on when they may take tables...or her annoyance by my suggesting I sit at the bar and have a few drinks while waiting...was told I wasn't gambling so I wasn't allowed to sit there...or at any of the empty tables to again, just have a drink and wait out the kitchen...she rolls her eyes again and tells me no. Who just says no? I get gaming on a normal night but to accommodate the overflow wouldn't you bypass that rule? I never yelp. I'm in the service industry, yelping is for idiots with to much time on their hands generally I feel like. But wow! I have never ever encountered someone so nasty while dining out. I'll never go back. I'll pay full price somewhere else.",

    "text": "We often frequent John Cutter after a morning hike out at Red Rock on the weekend because of its convenient location and good food. Okay, okay....I guess you can say that the female servers (the JC Girls) that they have there is another reason why we visit!   Here are some more thoughts on this local pub/sports bar.....  THE DECOR (3 out of 5) This tavern is usually dimly lit and has the blinds closed to most likely provide for better viewing of the flat screen TVs. There are a few booths on one wall, a long bar with seating and in the middle are probably at least a dozen or so high tables. Fortunately whenever we've gone there the place hasn't been packed because its a little hard to maneuver through the high tables area when and with a full house I'm sure that would make it even harder to get around. I would think that they should remove one or two of the high tables to provide for a little roomier feel.....instead of being packed like little sardines in a can.  THE FOOD (4 out of 5) What really has us coming back is the food. They have a good Philly cheesesteak sandwich (including a breakfast version with eggs), and when there are football games playing, they will usually have several specials going on. So it's really worth it if you're there during football season.  THE SERVICE (3 out of 5) Okay, this is a really hit and miss one with John Cutter. Sometimes the service is great with our server being on the ball to see if we need anything else. However, there are times that we've had to wait several minutes to get refills on our drinks. And no, those haven't been times when the place is packed. I just think that the servers need to walk through the dining area every so often to make sure that you've got everything that you need.  OVERALL (3 out of 5) John Cutter is still worth stopping by on your next trip out to Red Rock Canyon. But I really think that there are some simple things that they could do to make it a more pleasurable experience.",

    "text": "Went for Mother's Day here.  Ordered two steaks and two sides and two beverages.  The Ribeye came out with great flavor and quality for the price.  The filet came rare, when j specifically asked for medium:butterflies.  The waitress was completely incompetent and should be working as a gas station attendant, not as a server. She did not come out one time to check on the meal when it came incorrectly nor did she describe the menu/featured items to me when I told her it was my first time here.  I also had to get up out of my chair to flag her down for assistance when my steak came out prepared incorrectly.  It took over 10/15 minutes for them to reheat the steak (which caused me to eat the rest of my food so it wouldn't get cold).  When the steak came out it was more than well-done.   At this point I just ate it and paid the bill and left 15% gratuity that she didn't even deserve.  Some manager or maybe john cutter himself came to the table to ask how the meal was---I told him what happened and he just said sorry and didn't really care to have the problem addressed.   It would have been nice to have him come after the filet was reheated to ensure we were satisfied---oh well.  I will come back for the quality and price, but may need an extra beer or two to put up with the service.",

A short unattractive black haired mess strolled over to our table looking like she needed more crystal meth and hugged the guy I was with. Fell into his lap and said she needed a \"nappy nap\"  I walked inside got a manager told him she was strung out and to please get her away from my table. I went to the ladies room and came out to have her glaring at me screaming I would be 86'd and never to come back.  No. She needs a rehab. Gaming bats are infamous for unsavory situations.  John Cutters gets an upper class crowd however Mr Corrigan should match the staff. And he should probably drug test them.  My guy friend went back the other day and told me she was even worse. She is short with short dark hair I wish I knew her name. She is an embarrassment.   I've never written a review before because I feel it jeopardizes jobs but she should be fired.",

Service:  good throughout the meal but a little glitch when we tried to get our $20 free play for being a new card member.  The bartender was getting frustrated but we had a text that said $20 free play for new sign ups.  Ended up only getting $10 because the discussion dragged on and on so we just ended it by showing her the sign in the bar that said $10 for new sign ups.",

This place makes an excellent Moscow Mule.  Atmosphere is great, the Pandora-generated playlist was some of the best bar music I've ever experienced, and the staff was fantastic. I believe the girl who waited on us was also the girl who mixed my drinks; a jack of all trades! Drinks came out fast, food came out fast and was well cooked, and while not gourmet it was definitely a notch well above typical bar food.   I very rarely drink and I very rarely socialize in bars (maybe those are related?) but if I had to pick a bar to go to this would be on my short list.  I can't explain why it's a 4-star instead of a 5-star review. Four seems like the right number but I can't pinpoint any specifics and say \"this: this here is why I can't give you five stars.\" C'est la vie.",

I am very particular about steak and lobster. My wife and l ordered ribeye steak and lobster. When the food came out it looked good, but they brought me a butter knife instead of a steak knife. So l decided to use the butter knife.  The steak was seasoned perfect and you could cut it with a butter  knife. The lobster  was cooked  perfect and very flavorful. The waitress was very up beat and friendly The restaurant business is very tough and sometimes people are over critical. But l will  make this a regular stop from now on.  So John Cutter keep up the good work. You will see me again .",

This last time was the first time I ordered the Surf & Turf special for $19.99 (every Saturday)...OMG the portions were plenty, the steak was DELICIOUS (I'm guessing pan fried with tons of flavor), and the lobster tail was larger than I expected.  This was after ordering a 1/2 order of steak nachos....wow that was a 1/2 order?  They have 50% off steaks every Sunday...and I will be there to eat the Ribeye next week.

    "text": "If you're craving steak (especially on a Sunday) this place is a must! I had heard good things about JC over a year ago, but I didn't wanna make the 40 minute drive from Aliante. A girlfriend and I agreed to make the journey over the weekend and boy! So worth the drive!  On Sunday, all steaks are half off. They offer three different varieties: NY, filet or ribeye. We both chose ribeye, which is normally $35. Typically steaks come with fries or a salad, but on Sunday you have to purchase sides separately. We settled on cheesy mashed potatoes and skillet mac and cheese, which were both $7.  The steak was incredible. Tender, juicy and packed with a ton a flavor. Not to mention, it was huge (18 oz). It definitely brought me to a happy place.  The sides are described very well in the menu. When you think cheesy mashed potatoes or skillet mac and cheese, it sounds like you're in for a real treat. Not so much. The cheesiness from the mashed potatoes come from a slice of Kraft poorly melted on the top. Underneath, the bed of mashed potatoes are real potatoes, but they could use seasoning, milk and butter. The mac and cheesy is nothing special. It's tasted better than boxed mac and cheese, but for $7 I expect more.  The service could use some work. I ordered my steak medium well (crime, I know) and it came out close to rare. They put it back on the grill for a bit longer, and it came back well done it most places. I also ordered a Bloody Mary and specifically asked for them to not make it spicy, and it was spicy. I told the waitress, she did nothing. $10 down the toilet.  I'm definitely returning, but I'll probably just get the steak next go around.",

We had an after work meeting here (which was a pretty dumb choice in retrospect). The waitress' made it a habit to disturb the table with mundane questions like, are you finished with that? Can I take that away? If there is nothing on the plate, I think you can be pretty sure its okay! When the food was ready to be served another lady comes to the table and says, \"so and so had to go to restroom and I don't know who had what\" She then proceeds to ask all of us what we had in a very curt fashion. Very weird and kinda rude. We were all taken back a little.  At any rate, the food tries to be inventive upscale bar food. I got the \"free range chicken breast\". That chicken must of been free ranging at a senior retirement community in Summerlin cuz it was dry and crisp. I had to dunk it in BBQ sauce to bring some juice back to the mix.  I would not go back, especially since Red Rock is right around the corner.",

She explained the menu to us and took her time that was great however we waited awhile for our food I ordered mild wings which came out warm and kind of soggy but was very spicy so I ate 2 and ask if I could order something else because they were too hot.... The fries were the best my hubby ordered the chicken philly delishhhhhhhh and the salad was great... Like I said the food was great but there needs to be some training on the wait staff the ladies were very nice just need to be more attentive.....

Except this time they had a singer playing guitar just inside the front door. We hadn't seen that before. In truth this place is too small to have live music. Even if we enjoyed the musician, which we didn't, it would have been too loud to allow reasonable dinner conversation. Given the total lack of attention and applause , it didn't seem like the other patrons appreciated the entertainment either. The sandwiches we ordered were good and the service was surprisingly good as well which had not been our experience in past visits. Normally you have to set a trap or throw a net to get the waitress's attention to refill an ice tea but last night service was better. You still had to ask for a refill but it actually came quickly after asking. Given average food, fair service and the new loud live entertainment, we won't be back until outdoor patio dining is appropriate, if then.",

The waitresses will never get your order right unless you just order fries, and even then she will get you the wrong kind of beer. The waitress is more concerned about getting you out of there than trying to up sell on dessert or another round of drinks. Don't bother bringing ANY kind of coupons or gift certificates, the staff will argue with you about accepting them (don't bother telling me that I didn't read the conditions on the coupons, I did read and totally understood that you cannot use coupons during happy hour, we ordered food AFTER happy hour and our coupons were still not accepted). And lastly, I want to add that I worked in a couple local bar/restaurants and currently work as a waitress in a major strip casino, so I am very forgiving with any wait staff that I come across, and already have the mentality that \"the customer is always wrong\", but the staff is horrible and rude. Mark Riche's and the Chinese place next door are WAY more friendly and appreciative of your business.",

My fries were limp and overdone and the burger was lukewarm when served.  My wife's food quality OK.  The one thing that stood out was the lack of any urgency whatever to service.  I didn't time the wait staff or anything like that, but there were delays being seated, getting a menu, getting drink reorders, getting food orders from the kitchen, and finally, getting a check.  It was very obvious to me that the slot players and a couple \"regulars\" got a ton of attention and prompt service from the staff---everyone else, not so much.  Docked Mr. John a star for crappy service.  Even though I live close, there are so many consistently better neighborhood joints and I won't choose to return.",

    "text": "Just wondering- do owners/ managers ever read Yelp reviews?? Because diners certainly do! This town is notorious for being a chain Mecca- ugh. I love going to restaurants that aren't. We tried this bar/bistro on a groupon. Have you ever had Denny's ? That's about it. 1980's called- they want their Denver omelette back. A slice of watermelon & orange accompanied this fine plate along with a 1/4 cup of frozen hash brown potatoes billed as \"home fries\". Jesus people. If you want to open a restaurant, watch a few episodes of \"master chef\" first. No bueno. Service was ok, but a great way to increase your bill, and hence your tip, is to ask your table if they'd like another drink when their glasses are empty. This reflects on management- train your servers. Obviously you're hiring for their looks rather than motivational skills so just tell them.  Unfortunately, won't be back. Vegas- don't be do greedy about the gambling revenue- we like good food too- and this is not it.",

    "text": "I went during their first month a while back and I am still stung over how the prices on my bill did not match the prices on the menu.  Maybe it was just a glitch - but WATCH OUT.  The prices are too high and the quality and service just don't make it worth while.  I had the salmon and it was fishy gross.  I should have sent it back, I should have never gone in the first place.  The other people in my party who ordered the steak also thought the quality was extremely poor.  They are not selling you a good steak here - they are are selling you a poor quality piece of meat for a high quality price.  It's a shame since this restaurant is so close to where I live - and there are a lot of people on this side of town who want quality food - just check out how packed the Italian restaurant in the same shopping center is.  I would go again if they changed their menu and lowered their prices.  Also, I find the new high reviews to be a little sketchy.  The portions are not huge enough to merit the price.  I am always skeptical of yelp reviews where it is the user's ONLY review. *Edited to add: these obvious shill reviews have been removed*  Oh and here's the cherry on top of this whole experience.  The owner decides to insult me via Yelp with the following message: \"It would appear you have five star standards but a budget more suitable for quick service and fast food.  I do hope you choose your future eating establishments more wisely and find a restaurant to your liking.\"  This place is pathetic and they have been disappointing everyone I know who has gone there.  Watch out what they charge you!  This place is shady and the food is bad.  2012 UPDATE:  The Owner \"Adam C\" just sent me another petty message via Yelp 3 years after my original review was written.  Too bad he can't spend his time improving his restaurant, because several other people have trashed this place on Yelp.",

Our food was amazing, and you will not find a steak like that at any other bar in town. They are filets that you would find at an upscale restaurant, not what you would expect at a bar at all. Salad was amazing, everything was. The only gripe is that I freeze my tush off every time I go here. I love air conditioning, don't get me wrong. But, it feels like they have it blowing non-stop on 60 degrees! But, great food, especially for a bar. I can't believe others are saying otherwise.",

Unfortunately, our prices reflect the cost of our investment and the very high rent for the location.   I hope you will reconsider your review.

We called and asked for the manager during the walk to the car.  Jason the manager listened to our complaint and said \"he would walk out to the floor\". What good does that do for us?

Starting with the first of the two last visits, I came in on a Sunday evening around 8 o'clock, the place was packed and busy as expected. I found the one and only available seat in the restaurant at the bar. I sat and sat and sat for around 20 minutes before finally the bartender came by and asked me what I wanted to drink before finally handing me a menu. Other than that during that visit everything was great. The last visit I came in on a Sunday again around 2 o'clock, however the place was surprisingly not busy at all,  the restaurant was about half full. I sat down at a table and waited. The servers saw me sit down and walked by a few times so 5 minutes go by and I get up and walk towards the entrance to grab a menu and sit back down. I sat there at the table with menu in hand for 15 minutes without being approached once. I'm sitting there making periodic eye contact with the servers but still was being ignored. The place like I said, was not busy at all and no other customers arrived after me and I'm just sitting there thinking why am I being ignored. Finally I just got up and left angered and disappointed. I love the place and the food is always great and has kept me visiting over and over again for the last several years but the customer service the last two visits have angered me to the point that I don't even want to come back anymore.",

The chicken sandwich and JC salad are great. Steak salad is unique but tasty. The Mexican portion of the menu is really not good. Drinks are average. I am giving it four stars because it is a good local effort and we enjoy sitting out on the patio with a drink on a lazy weekend afternoon. It's definitely nice to have in the neighborhood.

I was here at Sunday graveyard and it was a bald dude with facial hair.  I sat down and there probably was 6 others sitting at machines at the bar.   I sat down at the bar and gambled.   At no point did he come over and ask me what I wanted to drink, I must have sat there for a solid 15 minutes before he walked up and said, \"are you good?\"   What kind of question is that?  No hello, how are you even with a fake greeting?  And too boot the negative question asking me if I am I good?  You will NEVER see me in this bar again  !!!",

    "text": "John Cutter is a fun little restaurant! It is totally A-Ok in my book.  Here's why I think it is ok:  1. Decent size menu with a lot of interesting options.  Lots of your traditional stuff with little twists to make them a bit different from the rest.  We went during breakfast, so I will focus on that for now.  A couple of examples of fun food would be the breakfast quesadilla, crunchy french toast, and a breakfast Philly cheese steak. I looked over the lunch/dinner menu and it has a lot of things that looked tasty as well.  It isn't a huge menu, but ok overall.  2. The flavor of the food.  I had the breakfast quesadilla with steak and I was quite pleased.  You get a huge serving because they use the biggest tortillas ever and layer them instead of folding them in half.  The quesadilla was stuffed full of eggs and cheese with an ok share of steak sprinkled throughout.  It could have used a bit more steak, especially for the $5 surcharge to add it, but overall it was pretty good.  The tortillas were crispy and held together nicely, even being stuffed.  My hubby got the crunchy french toast.  It was a fun twist on your average french toast.  It didn't blow my socks off, but it was average.  My hubby really enjoyed it though, for whatever that matters.  3.  The prices.  The prices all seemed to be a $1 or 2 too high on the breakfast menu.  The food was ok and with good sized servings, but it seemed a bit high, especially on the kids menu.  The kid's breakfast is $7 and the lunch/dinner kids menu is $10.  I guess they are going for a more upscale place with the prices, but they just didn't seem to fit.  4. The interior is pretty, especially right now with the Christmas decoration up.  There were big wreaths along the wall, huge snowflakes everywhere, and even some mistletoe!  It had a rustic cantina look mixed with a bit of modern leather accents.  It really was nicely decorated.  5. The service is on the mediocre side.  Everyone we talked too was super friendly and polite.  The problem is they were also absent most of the time and a bit on the ditzy side.  My hubby had a cup of coffee that was never refilled or even offered to get a refill, and the same went for my glass of water.  We were checked on about half way through our meal and when the check arrived, but that was it.  I don't think we are demanding, but a refill every now and then is more than reasonable in my book.  So over all, John Cutter has some good things going for it, but it has some misses as well.  The food is tasty, but a bit pricey.  The interior is lovely, but the service level is hit or miss.  When you average everything out, I think 3 stars is a good average.",

They sure know how to make you feel welcome. Like any bar, I have my good days and bad days on the machines. But I always feel like I have a chance to win here. It's great that they have food all night. I'm usually hungry after work. The steaks are really good but that Mediterranean Chicken Wrap has my heart . It's delicious. Only negative thing I have to say is, what happened to the juke box? Is it broken? I highly recommend you stop in and check this place out... especially on late night.. and you can thank me later :)",

The wait staff as a LOT to be desired. The owner should hire new staff and speed up the cooks. Then we asked for 2 checks. They brought 2 and had everything screwed up on them. We just laid what it was. It would have been another year before the checks came back and I'm SURE it would have been wrong. So 4 stars for food - negative stars for service. Have them 2 stars.

Tender and juicy.  Lobster was good too.    Today I came for the Sunday special, which is half off all steaks.  I got the petite filet with a side of vegetables.  Tender, flavorful (with a hint of spicy), and satisfying.  The petite filet is only a 6 ounce, but it filled me up.  The wet burrito is also good too.  It includes rice, beans, pico, and chicken on the inside, and smoothered in spicy green chile verde sauce on the outside.    They have patio seating!  The inside is dark, has terrazzo flooring, wooden beams, and a section of the walls is made of stone.  Kind of makes you feel like you're not in Vegas.    I didn't really care for their coffee, but I'm a coffee snob.    Their bathrooms are clean.  The music is loud in the bathroom, but that's okay.    Go here for the week-end steak specials!",

We have been here several times and the food has been good.   Now for the bad. We came in on a sunday about 230, sat at the bar and there was 1 other guest at the bar as well. Our bartender Jenn H. greeted us, took our drink order all the standard gaming bar etiquette. Asked for menus, take time to start gaming, talk for a second, haven't gotten to menu, she comes up 2-3 mins later says \" do you know what you want?\" We say no. Ask her to give us a minute. Comes back, gf orders a steak mid rare, she walks to the terminal, comes back, I remind her she doesn't like the chili oil, back to the terminal, asks me what i'd like, I say same steak, chili oil is fine.... she literally walked back and forth to the terminal to take the order.... Our order was 2 steaks, a salad, and steamed vegggies... rocket science i know. Gf cashes out to move machines, gives us the wrong cash, she throws the wrong amount back at my gf, we say umm still wrong, she says.. ok chill. It goes down hill from here. Shes saying you're trying to punk me, getting aggressive raising her voice...  short story long, this girl is clearly a pill head, and spun out... manager was soooo busy he couldn't come speak to us. We had to flag him down. He tried to shrug us off... all in all this was one of the worst customer service experiences we've had at any of the local gaming bars.   but hey cheap steak right?",

    "text": "We decided to stop by here for lunch after hiking out at Red Rocks Canyon.  We ordered an appetizer of the BBQ Wings. They came with fries, carrots and celery. This was the highlight of the meal. The fries were cooked well, seasoned perfectly, and the wings still had some crunch, and the sauce wasn't over done.   I ordered the Ranch Chicken Sandwich and requested a change of the breaded chicken to grilled, which they accommodated just fine, but the chicken wasn't in one piece.  It was two thin pieces of chicken stacked on top each other, and the one piece was actually two or three laid together. I needed to keep the toothpick in the bun just to keep the sandwich together to try to eat it. Eventually, I gave up on the bun and just started cutting the chicken with a knife and ate it with a fork.  I chose the salad for the side, since we already had fries with our app. I asked for ranch instead of the champagne vinaigrette because I was unsure if it would be too much, but the cooks made it the same as usual out of habit. The salad was overwhelmingly coated in the dressing, and they loaded it with so much feta cheese that the flavor was too much to handle. I would have preferred the spring mix with ranch and nothing else compared to the overloaded and overdone salad that I got. I also noticed that I wasn't the only person that the cooks didn't pay attention to because another patron of the restaurant had to send their side back because they had asked for something else.  The server we had (it said Blondie on the receipt) was excellent. Friendly and cheerful, despite feeling overwhelmed from being the only server in the restaurant.    The bartender, Renee, on the other hand, should be fired. She had an attitude on the floor and was cursing a lot. I don't care what kind of day you have had, it's inappropriate to act that way while working. You shouldn't be cursing about the guests either, even if they are people you know. (One example is, \"...get these f*@^ers some fries.\") Totally inappropriate and unprofessional. She needs a hard dose of reality on how to act in public.",

We went with my family today and ordered  a burger plain after explaining that my son was allergic to dairy . To my absolute dismay they served the burger twice ,  again and when we mentioned it still had cheese I watched them scrape off the cheese and put it back on the grill .  Absolutely unacceptable and will not go back there again .  They arbitrarily took it in their own hands to jeopardize my son health .  The GM expressed his concern and the waitress comped the other meals . Nice gesture but cannot take a chance on them again .  It's a shame as we have been going there since the grand opening .  I don't make a habit of writing reviews but for all the people who suffer from food allergies just be aware of their practices .",

    "text": "Two trips here in a week, and I will be back for more.  Good beer, good atmosphere, decent food, and fantastic servers make for a great time, especially when it sits across the street from my house!    First time was with my relative, who was staying at the Red Rock but wanted to see the house so we decided to cross the street and have a couple of beers.  On a Wednesday night they were pretty busy, and despite only wanting to drink and not eat, they were more than happy to have us.  Our server, Elizabeth, was super sweet and super cute.  The beer aren't great bargains ($5/$8 for a typical 12/24oz bottles), but it does get a bit less expensive during happy hour (4-6pm).  Last night, my friends and I decided to head over for some food and drinks, and despite being full and having to find a table for 8, they were very pleasant and speedy.  We ordered a bunch of  Philly Fries and Nachos, with the former being great and the latter pretty good.  Liked the fact that the nachos had real steaks though.  I'd like to try the rest of the menu eventually.  The server (never got her name) was again very awesome, and they are the real reasons I like coming here.  Experience never goes sour when service is great!  Table-for-1 Factor:  It's a bar & grill and they have a large bar area, so I can see myself parking here alone on those nights when I need to catch a game.",

    "text": "It's been at least a year or two since I've been here. Used to live nearby. This place has gone downhill...  ATMOSPHERE: It used to be a quaint little place to grab a nice bite to eat in a quiet, relaxed, upscale place. It's gotten really tacky since my last visit. Cheesy decorations everywhere. Terrible hip hop music (which none of the 7 customers seemed to be enjoying). The menu looks like a drunk scrapbooker made it...it used to look a lot more professional. The back page of the menu is dedicated to the \"John Cutter Girls\", full of pictures of what appears to be the all-female staff in John Cutter tank tops. When I said tacky, I wasn't kidding (and I'm a male in my thirties...I'm pretty sure I'm the clientele they're targeting and it was tacky to me). I think maybe the owner of this place is a middle aged, horny guy with no taste. If not, then maybe they're targeting middle aged, horny guys with no taste for customers.  FOOD: The food was still pretty good. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Flatbread, one of my old favorites. It still tastes great but it's a pizza now, not a flatbread. They should change their menu to reflect that. I probably wouldn't have ordered nachos if I knew the it was a pizza. The nachos were just ok, really sparse toppings.   I used to think this place was great. I talked it up to my girlfriend before we went. What a letdown. I doubt I'll go back. If this place were to lose the tackiness and go back to being a little more upscale and slick, I think it would be better off. Oh yeah, and I'm pretty sure the bartender was drunk, which just added to the tackiness of the place.",

Dinner tonight: two uninteresting wrap sandwiches overloaded with lettuce and a Chinese chicken salad that was a pile of iceberg lettuce with a vague hint of some dressing, canned mandarin oranges and some cold dry grilled chicken breast. That's not a Chinese chicken salad.  You need a better chef to design a menu that's great; simple, tasty food prepared correctly and served well. That makes a neighborhood restaurant succeed, otherwise just be a bar.",

I have a toddler so I appreciate that they have a kid's menu, my picky eater actually ate her meal and it's really exciting for her that the kids meal comes with a dessert, and they'll pack it to go if your little one is too full to dig in right after the meal. Prices are reasonable, or at least I think.   The chocolate mint stick things they have at the door are so good, i selfishly get a little greedy with them especially since my daughter likes them too...I mean, I will clean them out.   One negative is the food takes a little long to come out. So maybe, just don't go if you're starving or close to it.",

The person that I went with ordered the Cajun chicken pasta. That was good but you have to order it with extra sauce or else it comes dry.

I didn't expect a free meal but an apology or something from a manager would have been nice, or maybe offer to get us a desert or better yet a GOOD steak!  If it were not for their amazing Mac and Cheese I can't say I would even give John Cutters a one star!

It was seat yourself so I did so and was waited on promptly. My waitress was courteous and there was no issue. I ordered the carne asada flour tacos with rice and beans, and the whole order came out unusually dry. The cheese on the tacos was already cooled and the meat was hard and dry with no seasoning. The rice and beans were the same...there was a shell of hard crunchy rice, and part of the refried beans were so dried out it crumbled. I don't know if it was all overcooked, sat under a heat lamp, or just sat there too long before it was brought out. Service good, atmosphere good, food was only palatable after I doused all of it in salsa and lime.",

Prices are not cheap i recomend you try it with their weekend specials. Buy one steak get one free, sides not inclued. Besides having really generous portions. Food quality is outstanding. Not a divey place, not applebees. But still a very familiar/friendly atmosphere. The only downfall was some little cleaning details. There was a piece of red cabagge in our table. And in the restroom wet paper towels in the sink. Those little details got me thinking.",

It is a bit off the beaten path unless your path takes you deep into Summerlin.   The loyalty club includes gaming promos and a birthday freebie, so count me in! After the bartender signed me up, she told me $10 play would be available right away after earning 20 points. They have a sign above the bar to join their text club, and I did, getting an offer for $20 match play. I was informed that offer was the same as the $10 for earning 20 points. She told me she would put $10 on my card for next time. I shall return! It would be nice to get both offers cause it's confusing as to if they are one and the same offer..........?????  It's a small place with one big room for dining and gaming/drinking etc. at the bar. Must be nonsmoking, I believe. Outside seating is also available. The menu has many different apps, meals, etc. to choose from and they have a Sunday steak special for 50% off steaks.",

At the time it was already 24-0 Carolina (sorry Roger) so I decided to order a Bloody Mary and bacon, eggs, toast breakfast ($8) and watch the end of the first half before heading home.  Sundays are 1/2 off on Steaks. So the Ribeye which normally goes for $35 is $17...that's a good deal. Unfortunately the special didn't apply to the steak and eggs breakfast.   Place is a bit dark, but it is non-smoking for those that care. They have gaming at the bar. I've been here probably a dozen times over the years. They have several 4 top tables, and booths, and a few larger tables that can seat 8-10 so ok for groups.   Breakfast was good, nothing too exciting. Only 2 strips of bacon :(   Bloody Mary was tasty and hit the spot perfectly. Service was good. It wasn't too busy which surprised me.   Closest bar to Red Rock Canyon.",

Their surf and turf was delicious as well, easily a 4/5 meal. I didnt expect their shrimp/fish tacos to be spicey... but it was. Delicious but too hot for me. We had to ask for more plates and eating utensils several times.   I was hoping we would get comp'd with something. We did have a table of 10 and ordered a good amount.

I've driven by many times but never been tempted to go in, probably because of the location in a sleepy shopping area anchored by Albertsons.  It's quite cool inside, high tables , lots of tvs and nice moody lighting. I'm fascinated by the staff, I have a vision of an interview process that involves the following conversation: Q \" Will you wear this very tiny tank top?\"  A \" it looks very small......but ok\"   \"you're hired\"  Yes, it's Hooters in the 'burbs'. A bad thing? Depends.  Anyway, pots of beers and wines, the food , especially the burgers are huge, Michelle Obama would be seriously p&$/:ed. I took a chicken flatbread thing with some feta cheese and tomatoes and it was pretty good. One of the group took some Pot Stickers that looked a little too deeply fried for my liking but she was happy. Other guys took monster burgers and were satisfied.  I don't know what I think......it was ok but we are lucky to live in Vegas with so many choices and a Yelp app, I will try it again.",

I love the waitress's and I would give 5 stars if it wasn't for the hostess who seems to hate her job when we come in each Sunday. It almost sets the mood for an uncomfortable meal when the hostess makes you feel unwanted. I don't know her name but she's got almost shoulder length brown hair. Upon walking in she says \"it's going to be awhile\" almost hoping you'll walk away it seems. Instead we always give our name/number. We tried breakfast this time on this Saturday afternoon. Well breakfast and lunch. My b/f got surf n turf and I got the JC omelet. I'd recommend the Sunday steaks half off after getting past the poor attitude with the hostess. We'll be back for sure. And just to add, Alexus is the best waitress in my opinion. I think that's her name anyway. She's blonde and ALWAYS in great mood, it makes for a better meal when your waitress is in a good mood.",

They don't have a freezer on-site so all the steaks are bought fresh and moved out fast.  On Sundays, all steaks are half off.  I miss eating their steak and eggs breakfast (which is available any day) and going for a hike out at Red Rock.  It's an excellent value for only $11!  They don't give you a shit piece of steak that's paper thin, full of fat & gristle like a lot of the casinos advertising cheap steak and eggs (to get you in the door to gamble.)    I like the darker interior of the restaurant and the large and somewhat secluded booths.  As for the service, I've never had any issues with any of the servers.  Skinny Jen is my favorite waitress there and has always done a damn fine job!  The only single issue I've ever experienced was one time we decided to sit outside on the patio on the far left side of the restaurant.  We had to move as we could smell the dumpster located in the parking lot due to the wind blowing in between the two buildings.  We were relocated to a different table outside and enjoyed a fantastic meal.",

The decor and actual restaurant was nice, but for the place not being all that busy, the service was awful. We were there for over a half hour before they even took our order (2 breakfast burritos with bacon instead of sausage and a side of avocado). It took another 45 minutes for us to get our food and when it arrived my friend's order was incorrect because our waitress apparently had put in 3 burritos, not two, and the first one was missing the sauce it came with and the second one had sausage not bacon. They also forgot the side of avocado and when they finally brought it out it was old and brown. We finished eating and had to ask a different waitress for our check since it was now going on 2 hours and we couldn't find our waitress. When the waitress brought our check, she still had the 3rd breakfast burrito on the check so we had her remove it and when she brought the check back it had said they removed both the avocado and 3rd burrito due to \"customer complaint\" which seemed a little odd and rude, especially since we didn't even order a 3rd burrito.  We were not the only ones struggling with poor service. We witnessed one couple move from their table outside to a table inside and then to the bar after waiting for so long and other couples just left. We also saw someone come in from outside to ask for to-go boxes and their check because they had been waiting so long.  Overall the food was decent and the restaurant was nice and cozy, but neither of those things would make me return just because the service was so bad.",

    "text": "For a Wednesday night, which is a slow night, the service was just ok.  It took a long time to get everything.  I would only come to this place to drink.  It is in the neighborhood and I have been wanting to try it out for a long time.  They have a unique menu and a nice bar environment with a full bar.  There were 2 2 tops when we were there and about 7 people sitting at the bar.    Food: Wings and Fries from Appetizer menu and A Fat Tire (Beer). The wings were breaded and we asked for medium bc server said they were hot.  Which they were not.  We added a side of Ranch and Hot Sauce to make them more spicey.  They seemed like they were just re-heated or even pre-made.  I am a wing girl and live for them...was not impressed at all.  The only good thing is they were not small and had more meat on them then most places.    Service: Forget servers name, its all women staff, she was blond with long hair.  She was really nice, sweet, good looking.  It took us 10 min after ordering our waters to get them.  I ordered my beer after we ordered the water and wings and it came out with my meal.  You can see all the food up (when its ready) and our meal sat there for a good 10 minutes (who is timing anyways).  She did apologize for taking so long bc she was \"cleaning\" at 10pm when the bar closes at 2ish and the happy hour starts at midnight.  Must have been pretty dirty...  Overall I would come with friends if I was staying in the neighborhood and just drinking. I would most likely sit at the bar too, if there is an open spot.  I am not knocking this place completley, I saw they have breakfast on Sat and Sundays so they can possibly redeem themselves.  Since the weather is nice I want to be able to bring the dogs and sit on the patio as well.  Hope the service wont be terrible there too.  If so I have no problem walking up to the barkeep/tender to order drinks.",

    "text": "This is my Sunday Funday dining spot. I must clarify by saying I have only been here on Sunday, which is when they have their all day 1/2 price steak special.  I am actually on the brink of being a vegetarian, but John Cutters maintains that I never make the actual leap by luring me with its delicious cuts of never frozen meats. I die a little inside with each bite of my petite medium done steak and whisper it words in romantic Italian. Okay okay, so I also highly recommend the JC salad. The inside is small and dark with lots of dark wood decor, so keep that in mind when deciding what kind of ambiance you want to have for your meal. If you want something brighter and more cheery you are in luck! Recently they put in an outdoor patio dining area. This place holds lots of potential to be a great date spot, but not on Sundays. It gets pretty busy and you are only able to make reservations for 6 or more. Drinks are always good, but pricey. Tall cans of PBR are a steal. Kudos to the hiring manager! The staff is super friendly and they are all adorable. They also remember your usual food and drink order. Only once did I have a server (Iv never seen her again) that I really wished would do us all a real service and finish up her GED.",

    "text": "I can pretty much sum up John Cutter's with this simple statement; Their menu consists of 2 pages of food and 4 pages of information and pictures of their all female serving staff. That was my first red flag. As for location and feel, John Cutter's has it right. Easy to access, outdoor patio with occasional live music, and a large, open space inside. But that's where I stopped being impressed. I was told by a few \"regulars\" of this establishment that the food was mind blowingly good. I always take such statements with a grain of salt, and for good reason... And as I type this, some salt prolly would have helped some of the food a bit.  I had the Chile Relleno, given that this was a Tex-Mexish menu. My parents got the Lobster and Ribs. My Chile Relleno had about as much flavor as loofa covered in cheese. The Spanish rice was bland at best, the beans were runny and just plain sad. The Chile Relleno it's self was cooked well, but lacked any flavor or kick. It tasted like no one in the kitchen has tasted it in quite some time. I also got to have a rib and some of the lobster. The \"famous\" ribs had a BBQ sauce that massively overpowered the meat. BBQ sauce is good on ribs of course, but the meat should have some kind of flavor! The sauce should be the sidecar to the meat's tender motorcycle, but this was more like a tandem bicycle with two chimps peddling. The lobster was also cooked well, but lacked any wow factor. Even dipped in their butter sauce I still wasn't wowed one bit. The best thing I actually tried here was one of the salads that had nuts in it. It was well dressed and had great flavors that worked well with each other. But if you pride yourself as a respectable Eatery and your best offering is the salad, something's gotta change. I give John Cutter's 2 stars, one for having a good IPA beer available, and one for the other 4 pages of the menu.",

    "text": "Do you want to be ignored for an hour or so while you over pay for whatever you order? Then this place is perfect! I would seriously give this place zero stars however the food was OK, so I wanted to give the chef some credit because the food was average.  For anyone interested in a authentic \"Asian Salad\", this place isn't so perfect. However if instead of \"Asian greens\" you would like some \"shredded iceberg lettuce\", and instead of \"crispy asian noodles\" you would like \"dry roasted peanuts from CVS\", then this Asian Salad is a real winner! My fiance and I unfortunately wanted the actual Asian Salad so the iceberg lettuce w/ dry roasted peanuts didn't really hit the spot.  I had a BBQ Chicken sandwich and that was ok, probably the highlight of the meal. With regard to the service, it went from bad, to worse, to embarrassingly bad, to literally the worst experience we've ever had in Las Vegas. For example when we were ordering drinks there was probably a 3-4 second pause while deciding, and the waitress barked, \"so have you made up your mind or do you just want water?!!!\". There were also numerous other comments at the various stages of the meal that were just not what we're accustom to when we go out to dinner. How about a \"please\", a \"thank you\",  an \"is everything ok?\", or a \"do you guys need anything?\", etc, etc. We received none of this,even the check just came flying from out of the corner of my eye as she bolted by before I could order another beer, or we could order dessert!   It felt like this poor girl was a displaced worker of the night who was really just wasn't happy in the service industry....I mean the \"food service\" industry. Anyway there are 100000001 places to eat in Vegas where you can get a good meal, good drinks, and good service at a good price, no need to go here unless you are too happy and want to get a little depressed over dinner.

We read up and found out about their 1/2 off steaks on Sunday's and thought that would be perfect.   I'm gonna save me some time and effort by stating that the food was pretty good. On food alone I would have given about 4 stars. But alas I don't review based on food alone. Being in the customer service industry I have a keen eye and sense for how things should be done.   So here we go....we walked in and no hostess was at the door. A server brushed by us and quickly muttered the hostess will seat you momentarily. So we stood there in the doorway waiting. Finally the woman who spoke to us figured out the hostess wasn't coming and sat us herself.   Next...our server arrived. In unpolished form. Very unprofessional in appearance, speech, and attitude. (perhaps JC should hire on ability and not on whether or not you have breast implants and a mildly cute face) She then took our orders.   I joined their text message coupon service and showed the server that we have a coupon for a free drink. (which later when the bill came was not free. She forgot) We ordered an appetizer. It came rather quickly. That was nice. But alas again. No plates or utensils.   Food arrived. We had ordered the 18oz ribeye which was huge so we decided to split it. No extra plate to cut it on. Wonderful.   We waited 10 minutes for the check after she took away our plates after we finished. Then another 10 minutes to show her the drink error. We were so unimpressed with the service. Very sad.",

    "text": "I've been told about this place for the last year, mainly by my regular cab driver (you can't possibly live in Vegas and think you can have a bloody mary or 3 and then drive home) who drives one of the bartenders from here.    Having tired of the tasteless food at Red Rock after bingo, we decided to venture over the I-215 bridge and try it out.    1st: it is NOT fat friendly if you are on the hippy side.  They only have 3 types of seating.  Outside skinny bottomed armed chairs; inside you have your choice of high-boy bar chairs or cramped booths.  So just a bit of a warning before you go.    While we were seated quite quickly (in the ever shrinking cramped booth) our waitress was very slow getting us drinks..a standard Bloody Mary and a beer.   We were on the fence about the menu but it was, after all, a bar.   My dinner companion ordered the surf and turf..surf being 2 large lobster tails and turf being a huge ribeye.  Appx 35.00 for the plate.  It comes with a side salad that our waitress repeated after each entree order was placed (down to the pine nuts).  I ordered the steak fajita tacos with a side of Mac & Cheese.  My son, who was left at home, called in his order for pork chops which are on the web menu but apparently have been removed from the actual menu.    Surf & Turf:  I had a piece of the turf (surf allergy) and it was FANTASTIC.  The rib eye was cooked to perfection. Tender Juicy and spiced just right.    Fajita Tacos:  Even without the standard condiments of salsa/sour cream they were delicious.  The meat was tender, delicious and in abundance topped by just the right combination of onions/peppers.    Side Mac/Cheese:  light and flavorful.  Not your blue box variety, but a very nice blend of white cheeses in elbow macaroni.  Served in a steel pot.    If you can squeeze into the booth, don't mind the airheadedness of the wait staff and their continuous need to be posers, the sticker shock of the bill (2 drinks, 3 entrees, no dessert - $120.00), then it is well worth it for the food.    I will go again but will make it a to-go box while I sip my coffee from the fabulous Dunkin' next door.  Update:  We've been back 3 times since I wrote this.  Got take out for the steaks.  Still no \"regular\" seating outside.  It's sad because we are stuck on steak there and they probably have other good things but until they fix their seating situation my little group will never find out.  Note: you cannot be 6'8\" and sit in the high top chairs.  it just doesn't work.",

    "text": "OK, so John Cutter is a prime example of \"If you build it, they will come\" logic.  The Vistas sprout up and then this place came along.  Living here, I had long avoided it because of the magnetic pull of the place to SUVs, sloppy cougars, and the men that solicit them.  It just seemed like a place to avoid, which is unfortunate since there are no other real restaurants west of the 215.  Then along came the groupon and I thought, maybe I should try it since it is so close.  These are the things I have learned in doing so: -The menu is printed in the worst-of-Vegas style with one page of drinks and one of food and 4 pages devoted to the \"servers\" (use of quotation marks definitely meant to imply irony).  -The servers are really only hired on the merits of their cup size or degree of time spent on a hair-and-tan ratio.  They will rarely know what is on the menu, they will put your order in wrong, they will be confused about many things.  It is important to know this going in; Don't even try to place a to go order by phone.  If you can sit at a table covered by the Asian server, do so; she is the only one in a few visits who is always on the ball and gets things correct the first time. I am awarding a star just because she took the hassle level down here big style.  -The bar kind of melts into the four booths that are the restaurant side of the room.  It is a surprisingly small space.  If one person lights up at the bar, the entire place will wreak of smoke.  -The happy hour ends at 6pm which is kind of backwards.  Be aware of this fact.  -DO NOT GO HERE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT unless...you are going to sit on the patio and listen to questionable dirty-t-shirt type of live music.  IF you are inside they will simply crank the poorly-curated music to combat this.  The result will be a loss of appetite (why so much Justin Beiber in the rotation, why, for love of all that is good and sacred, why?) and  a loss of hearing.  Everyone indoors will start yelling for their companions to hear them.  It's not a good system...  And now maybe a little bit about the actual food here?   -Whoever said the food is \"mind-blowing\" needs to get out more.  The food is average, decent for bar food.  Due to the servers' low aptitudes you don't always get things as ordered which is a pain in the ass when you order a burger rare and it comes to you well done.  Or you order dressing on the side and your salad arrives weighed down by it.  -When the food is ordered and delivered correctly it is OK.  But damn if it is INCONSISTENT.  Lunch is your best bet, followed by Monday through Thursday EARLY dinner.  If you go in on a Friday night, the size of the food will be halved and there is no manager to ask about it.  On  the other times, the helpings will be almost double as large.  And last but not least, why this place is actually getting a yelp review from me...the sacrilege that is the Philly cheesesteak items (sandwich and fries).  As a Philly native I know that I am going to be more prone to being offended by these things, but frankly, putting mushrooms into the mix is just sick and wrong.  I love mushrooms, but they have no place in these recipes.  Onions, yes, but you put too little in there.  Peppers, add them please.  I won't even get into how your cheese sauce is so off the mark.  But for the love of all that is right in this world, stop with the mushrooms already.",

    "text": "I came to try the steak since everyone raved about it. It is cooked well. But then again so does my better half. It's all in the cooking, having a great piece of meat helps. We ordered ours rare and it was. It's seasoned well so you don't really need A1. Yes it's also half off on Sunday's. We didn't go on a Sunday. I think I will though. It's only across the street from me. I have not tried their burger so cannot write about it. I didn't bother with any sides because I only care for steak. Cheese on fries really is not my thing and I have yet to taste any cheese fries that tastes good. I love steak fries dipped in A1 or the juice from the steak. So all in all if you want a good steak. This place is good. And that's what I came for. Ribeyes really don't need anything if you cook it right. The natural marbled fat cooks itself. If you sear it correctly you get a nice crust. Service was about average. Not stellar or bad really. But then again we are easy to please. I will write another review when I try the burger.",

We arrived at 5:00 to a very noisy pub/restaurant with raunchy music that denied anyone a conversation.  I ordered chicken lettuce wraps & he chose a Philly steak sandwich.  It was slow in coming, as were the orders of the couple who arrived before us.  I was ready to wolf it all down (hunger pangs) but alas!  The lettuce pieces were small & the chicken had a sap-sucker sweetness that seared my tongue.  I requested they replace it with the Asian chicken salad.  Not a good idea.  It was made with the limpy Chinese cabbage,  the hard white pieces of regular cabbage, & big square hunks of red bell pepper.  The dressing tasted  straight out of a La Choy bottle, but being so hungry, I devoured most of it.  My partner's Philly steak was on a lackluster bun, contained no green peppers or onions, but the steak fries were good.  Our server was friendly l& anxious to please, though forgot to fill his coffee cup.  I can't give Cutter a better score than a 2 on a 1-5 scale.  And why return?",

The new  steak came back well done and the lobster came back smelling fishy and tasted water-logged. We informed the waitress and she was sorry but didn't do anything else but maybe she couldn't.

Guys, get some kegs in. Even next door at Al's Garage they have a few drafts... miserable ones... but there's an option.  Get a good light beer, an IPA, a classic Belgian beer and a Hefe.  We literally choose go elsewhere sometimes because we love a draft beer with our meal.   I can get a bottle at home. :)",

The server came around to take the order, and that was it.  The food runner brought out the food.  The server did not check on us to see if everything was ok, no drink refills, not even a look in our direction.  We had to ask another employee for the check.  Once she brought it, she did not come back around to pick it up.    We did see her scurrying between her other tables, so I'm not sure it was all her fault.  That leads me to believe that either they were short staffed or there are inefficiencies in they way they handle the tables.  It is quite possible that management is at least partially to blame, but as a server, there are basics that must be done no matter what.  On the small bright side, for the 10 seconds we saw her, she did seem friendly.    It is really a shame that something as simple as service can ruin what would have been a nice meal.  There are too many other places to go to put up with this lack of service.",

Other than that, I found the service to be quite friendly when our server would come around which wasn't very frequently.  The burger itself tasted as though the meat was freezer burned and so greasy that the bottom of the  bun was totally saturated in grease.  My friend that accompanied me ordered the same and said that exact same thing.  The place was very busy.  Maybe an off night??  Not sure I'm willing to try again for the high prices we paid....",

Well, I was feeling sexy for a moment!  This place rocks. Food is awesome and usually has live entertainment on the weekends.  Update as of this date: This restaurant has gone to crap. Their Philly Cheese Fries used to be to die for. Today, they are literally about 50 cents per French fry. My wife and I have been ordering this side for years and have always been satisfied with the portion. Today the portion is likened to that of a order of fries from a kids happy meal.   As a twice a week customer (party of 6) we will not be back.   Used to be able to order a half order or a full order. Then they stopped the half order. As of today, their full order is half of their half order. Same price though as their full order. $13.00.   Bad management decision that lost a customer.

So enormous, that you can finish about half of it and be stuffed. I personally wasn't too fond of the burger at all even though it was a good price.   However, I have been thinking about their Philly cheesesteak fries, and had cravings for it days after my visit. It was sooooooooo good. I was pleasantly surprised at the tender/juicy/fatty quality of the steak that is chopped up on top. The cheese sauce is the nacho cheese type that's melted (which I normally can't stand), but it worked well with this dish, and I really thought it was legit. Unfortunately, that was regular price. I'd for sure come back for those fries though.",

    "text": "John Cutters is my go to place for steaks especially on Sundays. (psst they are half off!)  The steaks here are so good that I don't need any steak sauce . I've been to steak houses on the strip, and Summerlin but I prefer John Cutters. The steak is so juicy! My husband who likes his well done said even his was tender and juicy even though his was cooked well. I like getting the fully loaded potato with my meal. The potato is huge enough to share but there have been days where we want two sides . We flock to the Mac and cheese as our second choice.  The food is wonderful so it can get pretty crowded on a Sunday evening. Especially since the space isn't that big. If you want steak they serve it throughout the day so I would try to head there for an early lunch!",

It's been a few months since we stopped in, they've since revamped the menu.   Krolly sandwich got the boot so my husband tried the chicken sandwich and he ordered dynamite rolls to start. Luckily I was still able to get the Philly.  The rolls weren't exactly dynamite, they were terribly dry on their own. The sauce helped a lot. The chicken sandwich was no better. Dry was the word of the day. He slathered it in ranch dressing to make it edible. Good news is the French fries are still tasty. Bad news is my Philly was a disaster. The meat was tough, the bread was dense and stale; it was dripping with cheez-whiz and it still found a way to be ridiculously dry. The salad used to be a favorite, they had a great champagne vinaigrette. Not no more. It was bland and way under-dressed.   Sad to say, John Cutter has bit the dust.",

Waitress at no time offered to bring out hot food.  Just received the salad. Food seems good but server terrible and uncaring. She should have sent the manager. I actually asked for one and she ignored me.  My steak came out well done I  ordered it rare. Oy 6:30 no steak. I just had to ask the server for my meal. Oh just got it.

    "text": "Went back to this place because it's close to where I live and tried the ribs that were on special, they were deep fried and AWFUL. Not enough enough meat on the bone, they were terrible. Like I said in my previous review this place is more of a casino than a restaurant, i'm willing to bet they make nearly all of their money on slot machines. There's plenty of loser Summerlin d-bags who drop a c-note in the machine so they can talk to some cute girl they think will might come home with them.  Like I said in my previous review virtually all of the food and drink is overpriced and sub-par. BTW, the owners have sold the restaurant to one of the girls that worked here, maybe it wasn't profitable enough.  I agree with \"Alex N.\" in his review where he says \"I am convinced the wait staff at this place collectively share one brain that is meticulously stored in a jar of jager behind the bar counter.\"  One of the girls that worked here sent me a message about my last review:  \"I have to say reviews are opinions which are here nor there but yours was very disrespectful and hitting the fine line of slander. No employees are under the influence of drugs or alchohal or of any drug. These woman have natural personality and do not need the extra factor you so call speak of. Only one does such activities can accuse others. These women work hard, and do their best at the job. If you have a problem you should maybe not write about on the computer and actually speak to someone about it when you are there.\"  I like how she couldn't spell alcohol correctly and didn't make much sense with her grammatical errors. I have actually spoke to someone about a problem here. I saw one of the patrons leave the bar intoxicated, driving dangerously fast almost hitting a man that was working outside late at night, only to swerve at the last minute to avoid hitting him. I couldn't believe what I saw so I mentioned it to the bartender inside, hinting that it's not a great idea to let patrons get so intoxicated that they could kill somebody. She said \"Maybe the guy shouldn't have been standing there\", I couldn't believe her answer.",

It's in their queso; it's in their Philly cheesesteak; it's in their Philly cheese fries; it's in their mac & cheese; and who knows what else. Seriously though, there Philly cheese fries are pretty amazing. Other than that it's pretty standard bar food. So I must complain about their chicken fingers. Disclaimer: I usually don't order chicken fingers anywhere because I think it's a lazy way to feed kids but if in a bar and with kids, and especially with kids who never get chicken fingers when we eat out, I ordered them. Much to my disappointment they were completely overcooked. By the looks of them they were already the frozen variety. So there wasn't much to cooking them except to watch that they don't--I don't know--get overcooked! It was so disappointing. On the rare occasion we actually order these things I want them to be delicious and just like we eat them every other time before which is usually, delicious. They were so bad and dried out that even my kids couldn't finish one. What kid in the history of American food eating has ever not finished a chicken strip. My four-year-old even asked me when the chicken nuggets were showing up. So I had no other option but to complain. The waitress just shrugged and asked if we needed anything else. To add insult to injury, the chicken strips were the only thing we did not finish and yet the most expensive thing we ordered, and we still had to pay for them.  Him: dad kicking, bad chicken, bad chicken wing on my bad chicken, I hate the chicken so bad chicken that chicken I do not like the chicken that chicken seriously I hate the chicken that chicken that chicken that chicken (using mic feature--haha). Seriously, bad chicken. Ruined the whole dinner because I wanted juicy chicken tenders with my mac and cheese. The lava cake was good. It was so chocolatey and the center had a yummy chocolate that I love, sort of like Hershey's dark chocolate and gooey. Maybe we will go back. It depends if they stop selling that chicken. I hope they stop.",

It was cooked perfectly!  Delicious.  The steak had great flavor and comes with a small (ha ha) JC Salad. Refreshing.  If you want sides they are extra, this is the only bad deal.  The service was excellent, just the right amount of coming over to make sure I was happy and didn't need anything else.  Didn't over do it though.   All in all I was really happy about my first time at John Cutter's and will go back.  The server advised me to try Sundays as that is when the steaks are 50% off, though they don't except the gift certificate on specials.  That's ok, as you get a better deal anyways.  She said with Football season here, it is better to get there before 5pm. No problem for a good meal.  :-}",

Tuesdays are half price burgers - they are big and very good.  The JC salad is very good (two hints - the small portion is huge, but order it on a large plate, and ask for extra pine nuts!).

    "text": "Ehh... it was OK.   I'm not sure if this place is a chain, but if it's not, it seems like it could or should be.  I ordered a philly cheesesteak (half), and it was okay. Could have used a bit more cheese, but maybe that's just me being picky. Salad it came with was good. (How hard is it to mess up a salad though, haha.)  I also ordered a side of mac and cheese -- yes, I was really hungry! Oh my! The mac and cheese was good but SO FILLING. I should have split my mac and cheese with a friend (who also got her own side). I kind of wish the server would have said \"hey, that's a lot of food you're getting.\" I know it's tough to gauge appetites and such but.. yeah.. we had a lot of food, and I hate wasting food.   We were driving back to California, so the food wasn't going to come with us.  I thought it was weird that they didn't have any beers on tap? Not holding that against them.. just thought it a little peculiar.  Also -- the atmosphere is kind of confusing. The building from the outside seems family-friendly, but once inside, it's kind of dark? Maybe that is to keep everything cool since it gets so hot outside? Just a little... I don't know.. confusing.  In case you're wondering how we ended up here: on the way back from Red Rock Canyon. We were looking for some grub before the drive back to SoCal :)  2018: 63/100",

Having said that, my business lunch here was actually pretty enjoyable. The salads are fresh, well prepared, and full of good flavors. I had the Cobb, which contained some deliciously seasoned chicken, Bleu cheese crumbles, avocado, egg etc. The greens were tossed with a nice balsamic, but it was perfectly dressed. My lunch companion had the Chinese chicken salad, which she described as \"really good\". It was actually on her recommendation we stopped here. We were working close by and she mentioned she likes to come here for the petite filet.  Service was solid too. Not amazingly fast, but certainly friendly and good with lunch suggestions and drink refills.   I'm glad we stopped. I would definitely return.",

    "text": "John Cutter reminds me of a more intimate and high-end PT's, without the loudness and cigarette smelling atmosphere. The customer service is also excellent. Oh! And much better food! The shrimp cocktail is not your average shrimp cocktail. In fact, it's anything but! Don't let the name fool you - you aren't going to be getting cold, rubbery shrimp to dip in a cold cocktail tail sauce, no. You'll be getting huge, pan fried tiger shrimp, with a hint of black pepper to dip in some butter (and cocktail sauce but didn't care for it). So simple, yet soooo delicious. Server over a bed of lettuce, so you could even make it into a salad if so desire. The Philly Fries will give you that hit-the-spot, artery clogging feeling...but in a satisfying way! French Fries topped with melted cheesy goodness, mushrooms and sliced ribeye (philly cheesesteak style). The ribeye, cheese, mushroom and fries ratio are perfect! My go-to appetizers whenever I go to JC!",

    "text": "We started out to go to Toros, only to find the bar about to close and no food. They're in the process of revamping the name, menu, and focus. So here we are, in the boonies, too late to do more driving, and John Cutter was the default option. We had gone there once, long ago, had some sort of major issue, and walked out before ordering. I  remembered that they seemed very expensive.This time we looked at the menu before we went in; apparently all the other restaurants have kept pace and even surpassed them, because the prices were average.  Our server, Vanessa, had a great personality and checked on us frequently. My Riesling, Monchof by brand, was delicious. We both ordered salads - Cobb for my husband, Chinese Chicken for me.   While he liked his a lot, I wasn't as sanguine. I've had this salad many times at multiple restaurants. Here the chicken was good - well-seasoned and plentiful. I liked that I was able to sub romaine for the Asian greens and get the dressing and noodles on the side. The dressing was typical and decent. But the rest of it wasn't so delightful. First, the peanuts: I love peanuts, and was glad that they weren't salted. But I think they were raw, and they didn't taste right. Not rancid, just unpleasant. The tomatoes and sparse green peppers were diced so tiny that I couldn't even spear them, and they kept falling off the fork.   The worst part was the Chinese noodles. When I was a kid, my mom used to buy Mee Tu Chinese noodles. They were kosher, as we were, which meant we never, ever had real Chinese food. (The story of my \"conversion\" is a funny one!). They were sold in a can and simply awful - though I didn't think so then, because I didn't know any better. The ones at John Cutter were so reminiscent of Mee Tu, and only slightly fatter and not as crispy. I would have hated to have to pick them out of the salad.   Overall, it was an average meal.",

    "text": "I have a friend who had been talking of the 1/2 off steaks on Sunday for awhile now. I had a rateSunday off so we decided to give it a shot.  3 of us arrived about 6pm and the place was packed. We had a short wait and were seated at a high top table near the door. No booths available unless we wanted to wait longer, so we took the table. Only issue was that it was cold so it wasn't too pleasant sitting that close to the door.  Our server came by almost right away for our drink orders, which came out quickly. We ordered the queso dip to share and we each ordered a 10oz filet and salads.  The queso dip was good. And they refilled the chips as many times as we requested until the dip was gone. That was nice, some places want to charge extra for that.  Two of us got the house salad while one got the Caesar. I got the house salad with ranch on the side, and it was delicious. I tried the caesar too which was also good. The croutons on that were homemade and fresh. Salads were a good size too. Our filets came out shortly after we finished out salads. They were seasoned well and great cuts of meat for the price. Gotta admit that they weren't quite done as we ordered though, with all being slightly over or under, not enough to make a big deal over it, plus, the taste and quality of the meat made up for that.  We decided to share the chocolate cake for desert. Wow, it was huge! Very rich though. It reminded me of the Pepperidge farms chocolate fudge cake you can get at the grocery store, but a fresher version.  Overall the meal was great. I'd definitely come back for the steak special. We've been to fancier places that served filet that wasn't as good as this, at twice the price. And even though they were crowded, the service was great. We didn't have to ask for refills and plates were taken away promptly. We left full and happy, can't ask for more than that!",

My rib eye came out mushy texture with almost an ashy after taste.  It lacked basic seasoning like salt and pepper, but is instead drenched in chilli oil.  While it's a thick cut of meat, it was disgusting and inedible.  It's likely from them not thawing out the steak all the way before cooking.  Husband ordered the salmon dish, same feedback.  Mushy, lack seasoning, and drenched in chili oil.  The best thing is still the French fries and grilled asparagus, but we're not going to be coming back to pay $27-35 to not eat our entrees.",

We ordered two medium rare hamburgers that came out beyond well done.  The sides with all of these were supposed to be Caesar Salad.  Although the restaurant was sparsely populated when we got there, our orders took about 40 minutes to be delivered, some of which time was spent with the orders sitting under heat lamps.  When we finally got the food, we found the salad and pickles had been brought to warm by the heat lamps.   So we ended up eating overcooked hamburgers that had ingredients other than what we specifically ordered.  The steak and cheese was dismal and didn't even look right.  The salad was inadvertently cooked by the heat lamp and limp.    When we mentioned this to our server, she explained that there were only two waitresses there as if that explained everything.  This is a restaurant we will avoid.",

Guys, when 2 sandwiches cost $27, I'd expect a really good sandwich.  Burger was big but tasteless, and a Philly cheesesteak has onions, peppers, cheese, and sometimes mushrooms, not a few burned onions and a styrofoam container of runny Velveeta!  Especially for $15!  It's a sandwich of last nights leftovers for goodness sake! Barmaids were fabulous, bubbly and sweet. Look, you are not a destination and your prices are WAY high for the quality you are serving.  No one is coming back unless the food is good.  So far, you're 1 for 2 on that score...   Oh, next time please wrap the pickle instead of just throwing it in the bottom of the box with the sandwich and fries.  It ruins the fries!",

    "text": "Yes I understand this is a bar disguised as a restaurant  / bar. The waitresses were not so friendly from the start. Probably because I had 3 small children in my group.  I found this place because of groupon. We were trying to get settled and decide on what to eat the waitress stopped at least 3 times, it seemed more of a rush than attentiveness.  Prices were high but I couldn't decide if they were appropriate until we tried the food. The food was horrible, stale chips for the nachos, guacamole was brown on top. A tiny bit of meat. The chicken strips were $14 and came with fries. It was like 4 chicken strips and a handful of fries. The chicken was barely cooked and room temp in the center at best. The quesidilla was good but dry. \"We don't have salsa\"  I could go on but I think I've made point.. It is highly unlikely that I will return. Incase I didn't mention it the waitresses were not very nice.",

Every Sunday all day Sunday Cutter's offers 50% off steaks. I can ensure you that this isn't one of those dive bars that use low quality steak to make ends meet with there Sunday special. There steak is absolutely amazing . If you come on a Friday or Saturday night there is always live music going on in the center of the courtyard. I've never had bad service there and would recommend this place to everyone as a must try. Also you have to save room for desert .Best carrot cake in town hands down!",

I asked the bartender if we order with her and she said, \"oh yeah I can take your order, I see you\" then when she came she rudely asked if we wanted something to drink and when she brought our waters she walked away immediately. There was NO ONE in there. HORRIBLE. I suggest the owner reevaluates his staff because I work in the restaurant industry and I can understand certain situations but jeez that service was the worst.

    "text": "UPDATE:  sent an email to Kristy Morrison, General Manager over a week ago and received NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT---speaks volumes to the service we received...  ...my first experience with this venue was this evening, Sunday, which is 1/2 price steak night.  Understandably, the venue was packed.  NOT understandably was the fact that 2/3 of the food we ordered never came, including one of our steaks! The potatoes arrived after the steaks that did manage to find their way to our table but the salad, along with a steak and the asparagus sadly must have been lost in transit.  When we attempted to voice our concerns to the manager, (after having asked to speak with her multiple times) she finally arrived at our table immediately ordering one of our party to calm down and another to sit down ( he had simply gotten up to go look for her at the same time she was arriving) and advised that she had already heard our complaint from the server and wasn't interested in hearing it again.  She offered to remove the items not received from the bill (seriously? Does this not fall under the category of 'duh'?) and offered a gift certificate for the inconvenience of the inconsistent service. Not surprisingly, we never received the gift certificate. She then attempted to discount the incredibly unacceptable service by indicating a full house and new staff. Young lady, Management 101: YOUR staffing issues are NOT the problem of your patrons; accept accountability and attempt to accommodate your clientele with respect and dignity. The only reason I gave this venue 1 star is so that my review would be posted. If enough patrons complain about the abysmal service this venue obviously considers acceptable, perhaps actual management will review its process and make some adjustments. Not holding my breath...and I WILL be calling in the morning to report the incredibly disrespectful manner in which this obviously unskilled manager spoke to the 80 year old gentleman at our table. There is a plethora of amazing steak houses in Las Vegas; there is NO NEED to patronize this one.",

I ordered filet omelet all egg white and my wife ordered the JC omelet. After 15 minutes our food arrived to a big disappointment. Not sure where they found their cook as the omelet had a broken runny egg with no presentation. When asked the server what happened as this was supposed to be an omelet, she replied that's how they make it as the egg white can not hold the ingredients. Wow I said. I asked her that perhaps your cook needs to go back to cooking school. My wife's JC omelet was substandard as the mushrooms appeared to be canned mushrooms with a thin layer of eggs.. The overall quality and tastes is not acceptable. I have to say that the young lady server did her best to accommodate. Prices are spot on but if you don't get what you order, even free is expensive.",

The food was generally good - I enjoyed the much-vaunted Philly Steak Fries, and ordered a Chicken Marsala, which proved to be an enormous pasta dish, not a piece of chicken with pasta on the side, as I was expecting.  Nonetheless, it was tasty, though the pasta were somewhat overcooked.  My partner ordered the Fettucine, which he enjoyed thoroughly.  It's quite pricey and a bit noisy for a neighborhood restaurant, which is why I'm taking off a star, but I think we'll be back.  It's nice to have a place like this in the neighborhood, and I wish them well.",

    "text": "6 of us came in and had a table in no time. We were greeted by our waitress right away and orders for drinks were taken. The menu is typical of a small pub, but I had been told of their Surf and turf special of steak and lobster tail. I had that on my mind as orders were placed. Myself and my buddy ordered the same meal, both ordering our steaks medium rare. 20-25 minutes later our meals for 5 in our party was brought out. My wife didn't receive her dinner of steak and potato. Mine and my buddies steak was crisp, and so over cooked it was dry and stiff. Our Lobster tails were extremely small (2oz) and straight up cold and rubbery. We asked for our meals to be redone and our waitress finally sent them back. Meanwhile we sit there and wait. About 10 minutes later we receive our plates back, but no lobster. Just a steak on the plate.  WTH!! This whole time, my wife has NEVER had her meal brought to the table! Complete BS and I told the waitress and she said she couldn't get it from the kitchen?! I'm pissed and told her so. Finally after everyone is almost done, my wife's steak is brought to the table. She liked it and was finally happy. Because the Saturday special of Lobster and steak comes with no sides for $19 I paid that price for just a steak. Once it was brought to the table, yes it was indeed good, but damn! So many missed opportunities to have this a good meal.  I can't ever see coming back to this place, as there are so many other places in Las Vegas that have better food and quality service and actually care about the consumers experience.",

The service was fair. Not very attentive.

Packed to the gills with finely chopped well seasoned steak. Since its been a late night stop its never been crowded so service was good. I like the decor but does seem a bit cramped but this I'm sure to take advantage of a relatively small bar. I guess I need to come on in here and give it a real good test during a busier time and order up a steak and really put John's to the test.

Our server (Blondie) arrived with menus and announced it was Happy Hour, except that Groupon did not cover HH items - fair enough. Hubby ordered the Philly Steak Sandwich (in fairness it could have used more cheese), I got the Wings - hot w/ salad. Both portions more than ample and freshly prepared. I must say I loved my side salad. I really appreciate when a restaurant goes out of their way to make a nice side salad (Spring mix, diced cukes, halved grape tomatoes, pine nuts and feta). I focused on that knowing I could take the wings home. Blondie was very attentive throughout our meal and all of the staff thanked us as we departed. They were decorating for Halloween festivities.There are alot of great choices on the menu, we both agreed - we're looking forward to our next visit. Thank you!!....so funny, I just saw last month a review with said there was too much cheese on the Philly Steak Sandwich, don't listen. Like my husband said. I got a plate and napkins, it's a 'cheese' steak, I expect it to be a little messy and I'm prepared for it.....go back to the old way if there was not old way :D",

I personally love the atmosphere of the place and find it to be a great all around place to go for lunch,dinner or just having drinks at the bar or hangin on the patio.. All the girls that work there are awesome and do their jobs well.. They got a lot of heat for it being all girls that work there but whatever, they make it work well.. Now for the food.. The menu recently changed and i haven't had everything on it yet but what i have had i have enjoyed, the real hallmark of the place is their staeks and on Sunday they have them half price, which is well worth every penny u pay.. The salads are good and i enjoy the caesar there quite often with chicken or without and i have yet to be dissapointed.. On Tuesdays they have huge burgers for half price that come with fries and it is a huge meal and they are very good..!!  The happy hour is better than it used to be and all in all the place is a fun bar/restaraunt with really good food and a great vibe with good people hangin around.. The gambling is good and i see people winning all the time, so do yourself a favor and give this place a try asap..!!!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I decided to try this place out because of the cute patio and some of the people's food looked pretty good- especially the fries.  I stood at the podium for almost ten minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge me.  Finally a waitress had to walk outside to check on her tables and she greeted me and gave me two menus.  She ended up giving my friend and I good service but that start almost had me give up and leave.  I wanted iced tea but weirdly they had none made that day.  On a beautiful day out?  Kind of strange.  My friend ordered a chicken wrap that had avocado in it and a side of fries, and I ordered wings and blue cheese that apparently also came with a side of fries or a salad, and I ordered shrimp tacos.  My friend ate all of her wrap and we shared her fries.  I liked the texture of the fries- they weren't too skinny and had some of the potato peel still on them.  The fries were hearty if that helps describe them.  The wings were good but way too salty.  I had to use the blue cheese to help drown out the salty-ness.  The wings actually seemed like they added pepper to try to calm the salt but it just was not working for me.  Don't order the wings here.  I ended up getting salad with the wings and we asked for ranch on the side of the salad.  We ended up getting ranch with the salad at no charge, but the salad came with some kind of house dressing on it.  I didn't complain but I also did not eat the salad.  I didn't particularly care for the dressing or the cheese bits in the salad so I picked at three cucumbers in it and left the rest.  My shrimp tacos was a very large order of three tacos.  I requested avocado in them which I am glad I did.  The sides with the tacos were a pico, a refried bean dip and Spanish rice.  The sides were okay.  The rice was a tad bland but still okay.  The shrimp in my tacos were shriveled (over-cooked) and also very salty.  This place loves salt I guess!  Total bill with 20 percent tip was $50 for two girls (two entrees and one appetizer.)  Not too awful but probably won't go back unless I just want fries.  It just wasn't an impressive place.",

I was told yes to both.      Well, they had high chairs, but the inside is all just one room, containing tables, bar, and gaming.   i guess smoking isn't allowed, but I didn't think it was an ideal family eating environment.      We ended up eating outside, even though it was a bit cool out.   Food was mixed.   My wife did not at all like the meat on her chinese chicken salad, saying it was tasteless and reminded her of fish somehow.   But, she liked the rest of the salad.   My grilled chicken sandwich was good, though the menu should have mentioned that it came with avocado and cheese; it wasn't a problem for me, but might be for some people.   French fries (thick) were hot and fresh.   i would have liked to try the cheesesteak, but the fact that it was made with cheddar instead of provolone scared me off since it made it seem inauthentic.      I probably would give it another try, but not with a child.",

The owner (Adam) has always been very respectful and gracious when I see him and I've never had a bad steak yet! I don't know what it's like to work there, but this is obvious not the forum for a disgruntled employee to post her grievances. When I go to Yelp I'm looking for reviews on the food, service and cleanliness of the place.  I must say the food is pretty awesome, I love the burger Tuesday's and steak Sunday food specials, but the chicken wrap w/ avocado is my favorite! I can agree with some of the other reviews that a couple of the waitresses need better training and when the place is busy the service does suffer.

I understand that on sundays it's a half price steak special and it's a great deal, but when you order a steak and it's completely over cooked it's not out of line to ask for a new one whether you're paying $32 or $16. I ordered a New York steak medium and my girlfriend ordered a filet medium. Her steak came out perfectly pink throughout, mine was grey all the way through. So I told the waitress I ordered it medium and she said \"well I see a little bit of pink so it is medium\". Then the manager came over and said \"you ordered a medium and this is how we do mediums here, and it's 45 min out for a steak\". We told him my girlfriend ordered it cooked the same way and there's a night and day difference between the two, to which he had nothing to say.  I understand that when it's busy it's inconvenient to cook a new steak, but to lie to my face is very disrespectful. Which I'm sure he realized he knew he was doing when my girlfriend showed him her steak.  The inconsistency in the kitchen and the disrespectful service from the manager is not worth the savings. Spend the extra money on a restaurant that actually knows how to cook a steak.",

Overall, the only complaint was the iced tea was weak, but the server brought replacement drinks immediately. I'd go back!",

Multiple items returned on multiple trips by multiple people in the group. I mean one night a burger was sent back 3 times from one person. The cooks CAN NOT cook meat. I have yet to receive a properly cooked steak. Medium arrives with no pink. Medium rare arrives rare. I give up. Last night was the end we all agreed cutters is off the routine. 3 of 5 of us are all in the restaurant business and all are pretty accustomed to mistakes. But this is just ridiculous. We can only imagine the food being wasted in this kitchen as we know we are not the only ones sending food back. On several occasions we have seen quiet a few orders headed back. I'm giving them 2 stars because there servers. Mary, heather, and Taylor. Are great girls with great personalities. But the rest is in need of serious repairs. Bye John Cutters.",

The missus had the Red Rock Cobb Salad.   We arrived to a semi packed place (mid-afternoon on a weekend). Although almost full, we got a booth near the front door. The decor is 'sports bar' with booths and bar tables with high chairs. The servers go for short shorts and tshirts. The place was hoppin'. Our server was friendly and quick - even with the crowd. She kept tabs on us throughout our meal and we never lacked for service.  We ordered our food and it came out in the normal time frame. The burger was cooked as I had asked and was one tasty burger. The missus enjoyed her salad and even got to take some home for a snack later.  This is a place worth the drive out (if you don't live in Summerlin) or stopping by (if you do). Prices are a tick high, but not wallet busting - maybe a buck or two higher. John Cutter is on our list of places we can go to if we're on that side of the valley.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g45963-d1723514-r340064481-John_Cutter-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html&s=38360f81a8c62495d98abd97fea59195db886814e63c77224dcb08ba2724b604\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

For dinner I went with their 10oz burger with all their toppings I added some avocado for an extra charge . Our waitress was good she was full of energy and attentive without over doing it. She asked me how I wanted my burger cooked I said rare and it actually came out that way . I know that sounds crazy but there are very few places who still cook things rare and they nailed it .   Very pleased they also make a good drink and had a pretty good beer selection as well I would defiantly go back here again great first meal on this new year trip thank you !",

We each received a text saying \"free drink\" basically. Nothing about any restrictions anywhere on the menu or website or promotion. The server decided to only allow one coupon per table. We had two tables and a large group of 9. This was the worst scam/sketchy ordeal I have faced for a restaurant. Seems like they are money orientated and not customer satisfaction orientated.

We got there about 3:30 and it was about half full. The service was quick and friendly, but the food - Ug. All three of us ordered the bone in Rib Eye, done medium. I used to come here frequently and the steaks were always good. I don't know what grade meat they are buying but all three were full of sinew and gristle. Cutting them was a chore because they were so tough. All three steaks were done to a different level. One was medium, one was medium rare, and one was close to well done. All three of us left almost half of our steaks on the plate rather than fight with them. No comment from the server when picking up the plates. My wife concluded that they may buy a lower quality of meat for the Sunday half price special. $17.50 for a bone in Rib Eye steak is a good deal. But, if you can only eat half then it becomes the equivalent of $35, the normal price! I don't know if this was the new normal at John Cutters, but I'm not going back anytime soon to find out.",

It was a little weird, slightly off putting after awhile. However, she did the YMCA, so I guess I'll give her points for that.  As far as the food, it was alright. Nothing spectacular. The Asian Inspired (deep fried) spring rolls were pretty spicy, but tasted ok. My friend's nachos had a long, blonde hair in it. Gross. It was replaced. The wings were pretty salty. The chicken flatbread- not bad. So, like the service, food is hit or miss.  However, I hear the Sunday steak specials are good- half off all steaks!

However ... the front staff is not the greatest when it comes to service.  I pop in at least twice a week because the food is so good and it's conveniently close to home but the staff can't seem to remember my name or even want to take the time to learn it.   Good food.. no doubt that's what keeps us coming back.  As always... show up for the 1/2 price Steak Sunday ... my friend and I pretty much eat out daily all across the local places in Las Vegas so we know what we are talking about when it comes to local Vegas eats.  Our last trip around we were not drinking too much... switch to water and Iced Tea which pretty much went empty as the waitress was too busy doing who knows what.   We eat and before we are even done with our steaks, the waitress brings us our bill. No mention of desserts or coffee even offered. Seems as if she was more interested in closing out our bill and having us hit the road then stick around...  Luckily Dunkin Donuts is right next door...   The last three experiences have been somewhat similar. I could certainly understand the attitude if we did not tip so well.... but we generally always tip well above 20% on every outing.  One last shot next \"Steak\" Sunday and if the service is the same... it may be time to look for other places where the front staff does appreciate us. That's what being local is really all about.   Sometimes.... it's just the little things that matter even if you do have a great thing going on.",

    "text": "After reading many of the reviews, I certainly feel validated.  I have visited JC a few times - usually when taking my mom out to breakfast or lunch. We originally tried it because they are owned/operated by the same company as Sedona - and my mom is a local.    The last time was just plainly ridiculous. JOHN Cutter has an identity problem.  It is a neighborhood bar/restaurant that wants to be a HOOTERS.   Most of the food is ok (good french toast).   It is the service and atmosphere where John Cutter fails. The bar is too dark and the music is too loud for breakfast or lunch.  To see a family with a bunch of kids or a group of lady golfers come in and then be served by empty headed young women with their breasts literally falling out of their shirts is just embarrassing.   The worst part is that either management has not defined customer service parameters - or worse, they know what is going on and are ok with it. Fail.  I think that Bill W. is correct.  It is a drag because the area could use an actual neighborhood bar/restaurant with good food and suited for everyone. I have no reason to return.",

    "text": "My wife and I were brought to John Cutter by my daughter and son in law.   I went to order off the Happy Hour Menu and was told the happy hour was over.  I pointed to my watch that showed that there was 12 minutes before 6 PM.  She then asked if my wife and son in law wanted to change there wine order to the happy hour wine order and price of $5. It was the same wine.  After ordering dinner and waiting, salads were brought to the table. The waitress was different that brought the salads and put the salads in front of my daughter and her husband.  My son in law put on the side serving of salad dressing onto the salad in front of him. He began eating the salad and had several fork loads of the salad when our waitress came over and said the salad my son in law was eating was actually  mine. She picked up the salad and put it in front of me. She then picked up the salad in front of my daughter and moved it to her husband. My kids go here and know the owner so they did not want to say anything. I am the guest but service such as this is not good.  The waitress normal  customer service would be to offer to replace  the salad before just placing it in front of me.  Again my kids did not want to raise a stink so they tried to make light of the mistake. Poor service that is being paid for should be resolved.  The restaurant has two flat screen tv's over the bar. I was watching the college World Series game on one tv when the LA Angels came on the other. The college game was replaced by the World Cup soccer game. Then the Angels game was also replaced by the same world soccer game , now on both. My daughter asked the Angels game be turned back on . The manager sent a message via our waitress that both tv's will show the soccer game. Again customer service is the issue.   I then spoke to the manager. She said she was sorry.  What a frustrating dinner.   Dr. Ken",

I have to say that it was the worst BBQ ribs we've eaten. The only good thing about it is the sauce. BBQ is too dry and hard it was awful to eat. It looks like it was already pre made and recooked.  Go to Lucille's instead. There was only one waitress and kept us waiting. I'll never go back to this place.  Returned groupon.",

Waitresses where nice but completely incompetent!! Watched the cooks do nothing but argue in the kitchen. I can say I will never go back and not recommend this place to any one. The menu is a absolute mess.  Who ever runs this has no idea what to do in the food  business!!  The only reason it has business is because of lack of competition !!",

I ordered the lobster tails- tender and sweet and just right-  the ribs were the same- the salad was substantial and fresh, with great tasting tomatoes.  My friend let me try her steak salad- delicious- the presentation was also nice for \"bar food\". I drank Pinot Grigio, since that was what my hosts were drinking and the service was really attentive.  My son let me taste his Chile Relleno, and it was really good.  He was not impressed with the food, but I think I trrump him as I consider myself an experienced Foodie with LOTS of eating in many places in Las Vegas over many years!",

    "text": "Had lunch today at John Cutter which I would classify it as upscale bar food. Had the bone in rib eye, house salad, and the Philly fries. The food overall is excellent for bar food in addition to having a reasonable price point. My sister and I shared the entire meal and the cost was less than $30 which was a bargain. On Sundays, all steaks are half off. The wait staff was very attentive and the ambiance was very relaxed. I really like the Philly fries which was very unique. The dish was a plate of french fries that is covered with cheese sauce, mushrooms, onions and shaved steak which was really good. Overall, if you want a great steak at reasonable prices, you really can't go wrong with John Cutter",

When we walked in it every table was full. Even then we didn't wait long and the service was great. I ordered a Chinese chicken salad and it was great. Though I probably should of ordered a steak because they are half off on Sundays. We also ordered the nachos that we're great, though lacking on meat. The ambiance is really nice and we will definitely go back.",

You can definately see lack of training between servers & there knowledge for food, reflecting the management, server couldn't remember a simpl drink order of 2 iced teas and one cranberry. Its been so many times we got served wrong food to our table in previos several visits, poor service. We watched our food sit in the window when we were the only patrons there. Once our food was delievered the server did not provide the adequate amount of roll ups nor plates (there were only 3 of us). Then the server disappeared and we had to pay our bill with the bartender of whom was on a personal call. Could she have placed them on hold?? We love JC's and will return as we love the food but the service is greatly lacking :(",
