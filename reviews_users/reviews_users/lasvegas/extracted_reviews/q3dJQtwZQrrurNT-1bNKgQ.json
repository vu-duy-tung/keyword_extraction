    "text": "First, I want to give a big thanks to Vegas Yelpers for recommending Capo's.  Good Italian is hard to come by in San Diego, so when I took my first vacation in over 3 years with the wife, and without the kids, I bolted to Capo's like a fat man to the Paris buffett, and I wasn't disappointed.  The Host was warm and funny.  The server, I believe his name is Chad, was both friendly and patient.  The calamari appetizer and the Cesar salad were my favorite, and the eggplant canolli was probably the best I ever had.  With all that said, the best part of Capo's is the ambiance, I felt like I was eating in Capone's dining room.  Tip:  The mix drinks costs less than a glass of wine, in my opinion this was the better way to go.  I ordered the \"Watermelon\" martini drink, and it was both refreshing and potent.",

You walk into the main entrance and you are in a room that looks like you got to be apart of an exclusive club to get anywhere else but where you came in. Ring the bell and a slide bursts open and a man asks you what you want and then they'll open the wall from the other side. BADASS.   This place is mafia style which is neat because I know of nowhere else to feel this way. They have pretty good Italian food not 5 stars but the atmosphere makes up for it. They have a singer who does Frank Sinatra all night and overall I have left satisfied every time.   I recommend this to everyone who likes to eat Italian because this is one place you can not refuse to visit.",

The veal didnt taste like veal. The chicken angelo was fair at best. I like garlic but the salad dressing was all garlic. Sadly dissappointed to pay 75.00 for this meal",

    "text": "My wife and I went there for our anniversary because we had heard it was a unique mob-themed Italian restaurant. When you first walk in, you're in a small room where you need to ring a buzzer to get in. A host opens a opens a small hatch to see who you are, then opens a hidden door behind the pay phone to let you in. We thought this was pretty neat because it gave it a real speakeasy feel to it.   You walk through the hidden door and you'r in the restaurant. The lights are kept very dim, which adds to the mystic of the place. After allowing our eyes to adjust, you'll see old mob photos on the wall and the chefs cooking in the open kitchen next to the bar.   The level of cheese elevated to a whole new level when we saw the music was coming from a gentleman singing from his karaoke set up. I can't make this up. He appeared to be a regular \"attraction\" because all the staff knew him. At one point his CD started skipping while he was singing \"Quando, Quando, Quando\". I told my wife he must be singing the remix version! He started the song over. I can only assume because he didn't want his artistic integrity compromised. This amused me on so many levels... who hires a karaoke singer as their entertainment? And more importantly... who uses CD's anymore???  Once we were seated at our table, the staff seemed very responsive and courteous. They did a good job of keeping our glasses full of water and clearing plates as we emptied them. The quality of food left a lot to be desired. The marinara sauce on my wife's pasta was cold, the picatta sauce was just so-so. The real laugher came with the side of risotto. Rather than taking the time needed to properly make it using arborio rice and slow cooking it, they steamed long-grain white rice, added some cheese and mushrooms, and called it \"risotto\".   If you're looking for good Italian food, I'd rate this place somewhere below Sbarro's. If you're looking for a novelty restaurant with a so-so mob theme, then this is the place for you! Otherwise, save yourself the drive.",

I was really hoping to be serenaded as some previous reviewers mentioned, but no tableside singing on a Tuesday night (maybe?). Oh well, it was still great! Our waiter had a fake Italian accent. The Godfather II was playing on the TV. Crime scene tape was on the floor. I loved the place!   Unfortunately the food was no different from that of Applebee's quality. How disappointing.",

I can choose ANYWHERE! However, you know how it is. For us locals, I know every single place there is. I was feeling like Italian and didn't want to hit the strip. I've been to Maggiano's and Amore's a billion times already. So I picked Capo's to get a bit of \"atmosphere\".  First, it seems that the Sahara location is a little smaller and MAYBE not as dark. Its also a little more open. Second, the place was basically empty at 9pm on a Friday night... kinda sad really.   All that said, my wife had the 'ala vodka' and I had the lasagna (cuz I'm crazy like that!). The food was very good; better than I remember. The service was excellent (it better be for it being so empty). The downside and a BIG reason why this isn't 5-stars... THE PRICES! Is a standard spaghetti or angel hair pasta w/ marinara sauce really worth $20? My lasagna was good, but not $18 good.   All in all, good service, good food, good atmosphere, not so good prices.  (P.S. if you like a similar 'old vegas italian' atmosphere that isn't so forced, check out \"Casa di Amore\" on the east side)",

The \"pink sauce\" (as they call it) was great with the meal and we even dipped the bread in it. Tried the cheesecake dessert and its not exactly what I'm used to but was also good. Reason not a 5 star: the restaurant opens at 5 and the piano player, which I think it a huge part of the atmosphere, didn't start playing until after 6. The food was a little over priced. Once you are seated the theme gets forgotten. No one is in character or there's not much going on besides a muted movie with the closed caption and the late piano player which we didn't get to enjoy much of.",

    "text": "What an experience!! I've always been curious about this place. I am delighted I got to try out Capos. If you are looking for no \"frills\" authentic Italian food that tastes fresh and homemade, then this is your place!   The Food: I highly recommend the meatball. One of their signature dishes. 3 types of meat rolled up sitting in a hearty tomato sauce. The stuffed mushrooms topped with mozzarella cheese is simply delish!! The gooey cheese stretches just like a freshly baked cheese pizza when being served. Calamari is crisp with a nice golden brown hue. They are not too oily or greasy tasting at all. Even the complimentary Italian style bread served is fantastic!!   The Ambiance: Dark but lively place with a mafia memorabilia decor in good taste. Live music daily with a piano bar and Sinatra tunes sung with True heart! If you are lucky, you might get to hear the manager belt out a few tunes on the piano. Very talented player!!   The bar hosts daily regulars who are staples of the establishment since the early days of Capo's existence. They are warm, friendly and are from the era that will buy a lady a drink out of pure etiquette. :)  Excellent service, great drinks (try the red wine Sangria) and even the coffee is darn good because they use Lavazza. I will definitely come back!! Grazie Capo's molto buona!!",

Service was excellent - attentive, courteous and responsive.  Loved the atmosphere and the music playing throughout the meal, from Sinatra to Frankie Vallie.  Overall a great choice and we will be coming back - maybe for dinner and definitely not with the kids.",

Red walls, dark lighting, Sinatra playing over the speakers, mob movies on the TV, and it's just like walking backwards in time.   Hubs had the meatball sandwich, which he enjoyed. The sauce was really good too. I had the carbonara, which blew me away! I really enjoyed it with chunks of prosciutto in the sauce. Oh, heaven!

My co-worker who had made the reservation the week prior, went to ask at 12:45 where our orders were. The server was not apologetic and rudely replied 'it's a big Table'. Completely unacceptable.

Insanely packed, which I understand the restaurant definitely likes,and I definitely hate. Place was so crowded and loud you couldn't have anything resembling a good conversation. The place was kept so dark the waiter literally tells you not to trip over people walking you to your table, and I was appalled at the 'entertainment' consisting of some mook butchering Sinatra's songs. I was ashamed bringing someone here who thought this was a real Italian joint. I'll never live it down, nor will I return. I will say though that the staff were very friendly, and the food was decent, though saying this is authentic Italian food is like calling Panda Express authentic Chinese cuisine. It's an insult to the food. The total crapshoot of an atmosphere sunk the evening. Not fun, not a good memory, just a cringe-worthy regret.",

You walk in and ring the bell, the owner lets you in and then you are met with the most delicious smells ever!!  Our food was wonderful tasting, service was great and the place was packed! (we had 6/30 reservations and by 7 you could barely move, remember, this was a Tuesday night).  Prices were reasonable, not cheap but you got a lot of food for the dollar.  The mushroom appetizer was wonderful as well.  Lots to choose from.  There was a male \"Sinatra\" like singer which just added to the mood of the place.  It's very dark in there though.  Even with the $28. Uber ride from Treasure Island, it still was a reasonable night. (Think $100. for 2, 1 drink each, appetizer, entree.)

No one came to ask how the food was ( my Alfredo was watery ) no refills on drinks , and when I came time to pay we had to ask the busser , he had no idea who was taking care of us but was trying to get our check for us . Some one dropped it off and then our original server who didn't care to wait on us came back and said \"oh yeah I didn't know you guys were leaving so fast so yeah I'll Be taking and running that back under my name . \" I felt as if he didn't want to wait on us because he didn't think he was going to get tipped , I work in the industry , I will always tip but to treat us so poorly made me think twice about tipping him .

The entrance in back is quite unique and once you step inside it is like you are going back in time to the 1930's or 40's. The red booths, low lighting and lounge singer really adds to the atmosphere but what seals the deal is the outstanding food of which the portions are so large you will likely not finish it.  We had the Scarface Shrimp Scampi Pasta and this dish was so delicious I will make this my go-to again and again. The service was outstanding as well. For a different (in a positive way) and fun dining experience, this place is a must-try!",

There is a little surprise waiting for you when you knock on the door, but I won't ruin any surprises...  The restaurant is dark with red leather big booths, with dark red velvet walls. They had a Sinatra styled singer performing, and we even had a magician stop by our tables and BLOW OUR MINDS!!  Seriously, one of the trippiest and straight-up scary performances I've ever seen. This dude was the son of satan.  Now on to the food... We started with a few appetizers. Ma's Meatballs, Calamari, and Bust a Cap Mushroom Caps. All were great, but the very spicy meatballs were my favorite. The warm breadsticks served with garlic butter were bomb as well. I ordered the Chicken Parm with Spaghetti con Suga and a creamy garlic salad. The salad was so tasty! The spaghetti fantastic! And the chicken parm so on point, it was perfection! The salad was one of my favorite salads I've ever had, and the chicken parm was possibly my favorite ever.  Now, onto the dessert... The chocolate covered cannoli was the best cannoli I've ever had. This place was a clean sweep! Awesome ambiance, cool theme and schtick, good entertainment, and fantastic food.  5 stars and a must stop for me next time I'm in Sin City. Highest possible recommendation.",

She would walk past our table as someone in our party was calling her. She disappeared on us for like 30 minutes. Then when it came time to cash out she added charges of about $49 additional to our party. She was given multiple cards and told to charge $40.70 to each, but she charged $47 to each card. We were already charged gratuity on our bill so our horrible waitress just doubled her tip. That she didn't deserve",

Menus were sticky and chandeliers need to be cleaned.  They are right over the booths so you look right at it.  So first impression.  Waiter was nice.  Took an hour to get our food once ordered!   Then when we did get it, side mashed potatoes were ice cold.  But they quickly replaced with piping hot ones once brought to their attention.  Lettuce was wilted in salad.  Ordered chicken franchese and it was a very small portion.  They asked me what kind of pasta I wanted with it and I ordered angel hair.  So pasta came on the side but with red sauce on it! The meals has this fabulous lemon butter white wine sauce that is so yummy, but why put red sauce on the pasta instead of that yummy lemon butter sauce?!  Cannolis were awesome.  I have been coming here for a while.  Love the old school feel.  Unfortunately I brought people with me that had never been here before on my recommendation and was disappointed.  If the owner is reading this, PLEASE give the restaurant a thorough cleaning and bring back the bigger portions. After spending $150, I didn't want to be hungry an hour later.",

Reservations were made and I was super excited to try it based on my fellow yelpers reviews. I definitely liked the \" mobster\" type of scene inside, the pictures and ambiance drew me in even more. For an appetizer  we shared the Peppers and meatballs - it was delicious.  To drink I had a sangria, which was both refreshing and tasty. So the set up was great, I was ready to indulge in my entree. I ordered the chicken parmesan. It was humongous, very generous sized serving but it lacked flavor and the chicken itself was super dry. I couldn't even finish half of it. I'm not opposed to coming back and trying something else on the menu because the sangria itself makes me eager to return.",

You have to ring the bell for access, but before they let you in they open the little window door and ask who you are....you know, like a Speakeasy....cute idea! Prerty dark inside (reason for the 4 not 5 stars). I like to see my food a little more. They have a Frank Sinatra type singer who makes the rounds to all the tables thru out the night. They also have a magician who was AWESOME!! Everyone really enjoyed their dinners!  The pasta is fresh made which is always a plus! I'm a picky vegitarian and my Linguini Ariabatti was excellent with just the right amount of spice. Angels with Dirty Faces (movie title) Angel Hair pasta w/peas,mushrooms, pepperoni w/a vodka type sauce. The chicken dish our friend had was also a winner!!! We'll definitely be returning to Capo's Speakeasy!",

Place is super dark, they have tiny flashlights on the menu. The bread they give you is hard with no flavor.  Ordered Caesar salad (Taste like raw garlic and butter or oil didn't like it) and Italian dressing salad (salad seems old not bright green or crisp to it).    Ordered the clam paste with white wine. The clams was soo over cooked it seem like I was chewing gum there. The paste was cover cooked. The sauce has a tiny bit of spicy which I didn't like. I didn't even finish 1/2 my plate. Took it to go. Hoping someone would eat it at home. nope ending up in the trash. Waste of $23.95    Also ordered the Sausage Spaghetti plus extra $5.00 for a huge meatball. The paste was over cooked again, the meatball was soft, the sauce didn't taste good had a sweet but nasty bitter flavor, and the sausage was just ok nothing special. Chef Boyardee Ravioli is soo much better. Could have bought a few dozen cans.  I would not go back there. I wouldn't even go there to begin with but my roommate gave me a gift card. So I went. Should have sold it. Next time going with my gut tells me and not my heart.",

Unfortunately not so great when I went back for Valentines Day.  Instead of being seated in the romantic main room with chandeliers, red booths and great service, we were seated in an annex room off to the side which not only felt like we were dining in a caboose, it was also right next to the kitchen!  Not romantic at all, service was terrible and food iffy.  The staff were completely overwhelmed and had obviously overbooked.   We just ordered appetizers in order to get out of that place as soon as possible.  That being said, I guess I learned my lesson about trying to dine out on Valentines day.  Will definitely go back on a regular day and hopefully will be able to come back and give 5 stars!",

There are few lights on, so you can't entirely tell if it is open or night, and it was a little confusing as to where the entrance, until I saw the giant \"entrance\" sign.   I agree with the other reviews about the fun speakeasy entrance.   We were walked to out booth, but I had to watch a few spots because it seems like the wood floor is starting to rot in spots. But you can't see it because the place is very dimly lit. There was music playing and a Sinatra-ish live singer. The music was on the loud side, but good.   We were given menus, and then realized that a simple spaghetti is $18. And if you want to share it, they want to charge you an additional $6. The spaghetti is basically the cheapest thing on the menu besides appetizers. We decided this place was out of our price range and left before we even tried any of the food.  I was a little bummed cause the atmosphere was fun, but that is just too much to pay for a little bit of pasta.",

    "text": "This is a unique experience, highlighted by the mob themed schtick that starts literally as you enter the door. The food, is better than average and you get a lot of it! The meatball appetizer is terrific, and everyone was happy with their meals. Desert was also top notch with the cannoli. Here's the one rub, and it's annoying. Because we had 8 of us, the 18% tip is included. That's fair, but I have to say that our waitress was below par. Inattentive, and lacking instincts to determine some basic needs that we had were annoying, but literally having to have other servers find her for us was aggravating. She seemed to lack training and her work ethic was marginal. I still say come for the food and atmosphere, but beware that automatic tipping leads to unmotivated waitresses on occasion.",

    "text": "I have been here multiple times.  I have been here for multiple occasions.  I have always talked up Capo's Italian Cuisine (CIC), no doubt!  As a matter of fact, I talked up CIC to at least 3 other people before my most recent visit this week (02/22).  I mean...REALLY talked up!  CIC has taken on an almost magical type of of existence to me.  Why the 3 stars then?  I'll get to that eventually.  Let me first discuss why I \"dug\" this place......  Gangster...ole' school gangster.  I don't want to give too much away.  Mafioso themed...no doubt.    Dark...very dark.  That is lighting and ambience.  Has nothing to do with the wait staff, and the food.....more on that in just a bit.  Cool lyrical(s)....you might get some soothing sounds by some cool ass crooner singing a little Sinatra or a little Dino.  I have found the volume to vary...but never over whelming.  Magic?!  Yup!  Depending on the night/time you visit, your gonna get some of the best up close, in your face MAGIC...you have ever seen!  The wait staff......Always friendly and during my most recent visit...defused the situation.  Not the maitre d'....not the manager...more on that later.  The food.  Absolutely phenomenal!  So much so that during lunch and during dinner...I leave the upper north end of the valley and go to parts I would rather not after work..or during high travel hours...or travel multiple miles period!  I love the following....  Cheesy bread....Check.  Nico's Caesar....Check.  \"Chicken Lucchese\"....Chicken breast breaded topped with mozzarella, broccoli, mushroom, capers, lemon, butter, white wine & a touch of crushed red pepper / 24.95 (Retrieved from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcaposrestaurant.blogspot.com%2Fp%2Fmenu.html&s=f14023d30c20b0489b70f0d1f9cad38222c6f6ece693fb4fe14f0a95825f7782\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">caposrestaurant.blogspot...</a>)....Check.  \"Angels with Dirty Faces\"  Angel hair pasta with peas, mushrooms & pepperoni,  tossed with Capo's pink sauce / 18.95 (Retrieved from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcaposrestaurant.blogspot.com%2Fp%2Fmenu.html&s=f14023d30c20b0489b70f0d1f9cad38222c6f6ece693fb4fe14f0a95825f7782\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">caposrestaurant.blogspot...</a>)....Check.  And now......the negative....what has placed a seed of doubt in my head..perhaps...forever.  The GF and I decided to spend a belated Valentine's Day dinner here on 02/22/18.  After working, rushed home to make myself somewhat presentable.  Changed out and got on the road and arrived 10 minutes before our \"RESERVATIONS\" at 7:30 PM.  The atmo was that of pure chaos.  Not what I have become accustomed too at CIC.  There was a \"hurry up and get in here\" type of vibe, followed up with the maitre d' will be right with you....NOT.  The waiting area leaves something to be desired and bodies started staking up.  Some of those before became frustrated and punched out.  Bodies continued to stack.  The \"maitre d'\" occasionally showed up, but there was little to no attention shown to \"RESERVATION\" times.  I can verify this because.....RANDOMLY, the GF saw a friend and another party that showed with.....NO RESERVATIONS...get seated before us.  It was almost 40 minutes before we were shown a table.  A table that was presented to dine at or we could wait for a booth that was being prepared.  Hell, we waited that long, lets wait for the booth.  Almost 45 minutes....we finally sat down to eat.  Our experience with those in charge was nothing but shall I say.....glib.  Hands down the worst \"reservation\" experience I have had in my almost 22 years in Vegas.    Enough...no more dinners.  Maybe I'll return during the lunching hour.",

    "text": "I have been dining at Capos for over two years now and this review is so overdue. This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, I have dined here over 10 times! (I always forget to check in) I absolutely love the mobster vibe this place gives out. I have only dined here in the evenings date nights, family gatherings and fine dinings.  Each time you dine here you gotta buzz in and the guy with the mob (host) will ask for the password or reservation. Once you tell him you do or not (name and time) he'll open the door and let you in. As you walk in, it's pretty dark which I love! Definitely different from all other restaurants I have dined at.   There is live entertainment from a nice gentleman who sounds like Sinatra which I thought was a recording but his actual voice. He sung my boyfriend and I a song and even included my name! Came I give this place 10 stars!!!??  The servers are friendly and nice, drinks are delicious I recommend the raspberry Italian Margarita so good!  The food is to die for. I am never disappointed here at all. If you want an adventurous night filled with good eats and entertainment you must come! I also recommend to make a reservation because this place is very popular; tables and bar setting fills up quick.  Try it, you won't be disappointed at all!",

It had lots of clams but the sauce was average. The Cesar salad was good fresh and large. The wine list by the bottle was large and prices were reasonable. I had the Tiramisu and I was very disappointed it was dry and very full of the lady fingers. The surprise of the night was the port list. It was great with Taylor 10 20 and 30 year Ports being available. Service was good our waiter was very attentive the negative was the kitchen seemed slow that night but not a huge deal.  I would definitely come back and try more of the menu.",

From the time I made reservations and spoke to Janeen customer service had been amazing. We reserved the back room with a party of 22 and food was served family style. We had sooo much food that was absolutely delicious.   The boys helped my mother in law from her wheelchair to a chair, I must say that made her year. By the way the boys were very handsome.   We had a 4-course dinner which was served in style. Janeen made sure everyone was well taken care of.   To top off the night cheesecake was served with many candles.   Amazing time but on top of the wonderful time Janeen made sure left overs were not wasted but went to folks that are in need.   Capos is our go to restaurant when in Las Vegas now our family knows the best place for Italian food and ambience.   Love Capos.  You are FANTASTIC! Best experience when away from home.

Kevin will sing you a few songs from Sinatra or Tony Bennett and he will also let you know he's met them.  Good place off the strip a few miles   If you're a local an easy drive if you are just visiting it's a 10 dollar Uber.   Have fun!",

I guess I should have done a bit more research before stopping by because I had no idea it was a speak easy type setting. When you walk in you need to ring a doorbell to gain access and then are ushered through a somewhat secret entrance way.  The place has a super old time mobster feel to it. The lighting was super dark and there was some Sinatra type live music, def a cool and different vibe.  Food wise we absolutely loved the pasta and meatball. It has a very tasty, homemade flavor and the portion size was enough for us to share. The stuffed mushrooms were pretty tasty too. They had a bit of a spicy sausage kick to them.   I would certainly come back here again, but recommend making reservations before since we were only able to sit at the bar.",

You will not be disappointed with Capo's.  First off, the entrance is not obvious, you have to be buzzed in after answering a question or maybe even two. The lighting is a bit dark but it adds to the theme which of course is all about the mob. Capone is everywhere on the walls as well as many of his counterparts from then and even more recent.   The food was amazing. We had the stuffed mushrooms and bread as our appetizer. That was something I would go back for alone. Both my wife and I had pasta dishes which were fantastic. My penne pasta with vodka sauce and a meatball was incredible and my wife's cheese tortellini with alfredo sauce and pepperoni was just as good.  The service was superb and everyone there was extremely pleasant to talk to. If I'm back in Las Vegas, I'm going to Capo's! Jeff",

I can never go to an Italian restaurant and not order tiramisu. It was delicious. The table ordered cannolis, they too were yummy and super sweet!

When you walk in you have to ring the door bell and someone will answer in a small window. its a pretty nice experience.. the inside of the restaurant is very dark and very \" mafia\" like... the food is decent but the best part is that  they always have someone signing during the weekends.",

    "text": "First heard about Capo's from \"Man Finds Food\".  We knew we had to give Capo's a try.  We wanted to have lunch, and when we drove up, saw it was 2-for-Tuesday.  Great start so far.  Walked around, took photos, and went to enter.  Pushed the button, and sure enough, a young guy slides open the \"visual door\", and tells us to \"get in here\".  Wall/door swings open, and our senses are indulged with the ambiance.  Speaking of ambiance, there is no one word to describe Capo's.  You say something about the food, you miss the atmosphere.  You say about the atmosphere, you miss the employees.  You get the idea.  We are seated in a booth, and the darkness of the place just exudes speak-easy.  The smells from the kitchen tell us we chose wisely.  When our waiter arrives, we ask about the 2-for, and he tells us that is't $20 off the second entree for dinner.  Lunch now?  We decide to see the dinner menu, and that was the right decision.  Each menu had a little flashlight attached to it, as yes, it is that dark.  We order, then sit back and soak in the feel.    I had to use the facilities, and when I returned, the guy that gave directions was also the singer.  Very friendly/talkative, and when I told him it was our anniversary (celebrating a bit late), he offered to sing a song or 2 for us.  That was very special.  The song?  \"Unforgettable\".  Food arrives, and our taste buds could not wait.  Wife had the ravioli, and I the spaghetti with veggie ball.  One bite, and we are in love with Capo's.  You know when you read/hear/watch a review, and you think that might work?  MFF was so far off........  it was that good.  NO, it was that excellent!!!  The cheese in wife's ravioli melted in her mouth, it was so smooth.  Was my meatball really veggie?  There was a heft to it that was never experienced before.  I don't know if they put something extra in it, as I was on gastro-relaxation for the next few hours.  And......  another song for us before we left.  Capo's, know that on future trips to Vegas, we plan on visiting you over and over.  I wonder how good lunch is?????",

    "text": "I really loved this place.  I have been driving by it forever and thought it was just some junky poker bar.  I saw the reviews on Yelp and was surprised at how high the reviews were given my impression of the outside.  The bf and I were looking for a happy hour spot and Capo's came up.  Remembering the positive reviews I decided to give it a shot.  The inside of the restaurant is beautiful.  Very romantic with live music.  Now I get it that it is consistent with a prohibition bar, mangy on the outside, luxurious on the inside.    The bar manager was very helpful in terms of ordering suggestions.  We were there at happy hour so sat at the bar and enjoyed 1/2 off appetizers and the bf had a few 1/2 off drinks.   There is a lot to see in this restaurant.  We watched the bar manager argue with the musician to sing more and drink less, the kitchen is open and watched all the food being prepared and the cooks talk back and forth between each other and wrangle over each other to get the food cooked, and watched the matre d' yell at people in the \"secret entrance\" about coming in.  Had we been sitting in the dinning room we would have missed all this.  And this may not be for all people, but we loved it.  I am so over personality-less drones asking me if I have ever tried their world famous chicken poppers, or something to that effect.    We got there around 5pm and it was pretty slow, by the time we left at 7pm the place was packed.  It turns out that we were there on Tuesday which is there 2 - 1 Tuesday, 2 entrees for the price of 1.  The bf and I decided to come back on another Tuesday to try the entree menu.    The only downside was that we ordered deserts to go, the bf got a red velvet cheesecake and I got the bread pudding.  I don't really like either cheesecake or red velvet (both are highly overrated as far as I'm concerned), but I did try a bite of his and could appreciate it.  Unfortunately the bread pudding was a fail.  It was more like cinnamon french toast, not really what I wanted.  I still won't reduce a star for that though, I just won't order it again.",

    "text": "We met some friends at Capos Italian Restaurant (their only location now being on W. Sahara Ave in LV, NV.    We loved the other location and were hoping that the new location would be just as good or better.   Please note that we are a couple that go out to dinner often, we like all kinds of food and are willing to pay for great service, food and ambiance.  Our journey here began when we went into the private room entrance and we were asked \"how many are in your party.\"    For those of you who frequented the \"other\" location, this was a first of many touches that are now gone from the \"new\" location.   We were then asked if we wanted to sit at our table and wait for our friends.    We opted to have a drink at the bar.   The bar is actually opposite the open kitchen which is very HOT and not comfortable at all.   The bartender, who was a very good one, was talking to us about schedule issues for the staff and how she was supposed to be there in the morning and not the evening......etc, etc.    Not exactly a welcoming opener to our dinner.       Our friends showed up within a few minutes and we were escorted back to a back booth in the restaurant.    I asked if it was a good table and was told it was \"superb\".   Ah, if they only told us that a large party was going to be sitting in front of us!   The noise was so loud I couldn't hear the people next to me talk.   When the singer began his act, the place was way over the top loud.   In the other location, the singer interacted with the people in the restaurant.   This was not the case here.  The restaurant air-conditioning was almost non-existent and actually become extremely uncomfortable.   No, I wasn't having a hot flash, I was HOT!   Is this a sign of the restaurant not being able to afford their energy bill??  Our waitress was very nonchalant and really not very friendly.    We ordered drinks, and then dinner.   The menu is extensive although no eggplant dishes which was weird for an Italian Restaurant.   The food was just \"okay\".   We have definitely had better and for way less money.      One of the ladies in our party had a shrimp dish and the shrimp was almost hard as a rock and way overcooked.   When the Chef came around to ask how things were, our friend said that her shrimp dish was way overcooked.   His response, \"thank you for letting us know\", and moved on.     We had a piece of cheese cake for dessert with caramel sauce and it was worse than store bought cheese cake.     The flavor was simply \"okay\".   Not great.  We did use a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> coupon which saved us $30 but the coupon also stipulates that 18% gratuity is added to the check.   I would skip this restaurant and this coupon.      With so many choices for GREAT Italian food, I would definitely avoid this restaurant and try some of the GREAT ones here in Vegas.",

The place was empty The only cool thing everyone seems to like is not knowing what door to go in and when you do find it you knock and they ask who sent ya. Other than that the place is WAY too dark. Didn't have a good feel like some places give you a romantic feeling or cozy  this did not it was actually a little creepy to me. We sat and waited it seemed like a  long time to be waited on because they must have things to do before they take orders or something. We were there way too long. I think they do have coupons you can get on Groupon make sure you do this because paying full price you will not be happy. Do you know the feeling when you eat someplace and feel like you were ripped off?  That's how we felt after eating here. Over all the food is not as good as it use to be.  The service is no where as good as it should be. Not worth making the trip there especially if you are near the strip. It is up Sahara pretty far. We won't be going back there are WAY better Italian places in town that are MUCH better!!",

    "text": "A short drive from the strip, Capo's is totally worth leaving the bright lights and drunken frat boys stumbling down Las Vegas Boulevard. Go West on Tropicana and you're there in about 15 minutes.  The beauty is in the details at Capo's. When you arrive, you walk into a small vestibule. Soon, a small window slides open and a slightly frightening italian man asks what you want. If you manage to convince him you deserve entrance (don't worry- you will), he disappears, only to reappear shortly thereafter to open the door wide, allowing you into the dimly lit restaurant. The chairs and booths are comfortable. The music is fun and often sung by a guy trying for all his might to be Sinatra. Old ganster movies such as the OG Ocean's 11 are playing on a large flatscreen above the bar. The walls are decorated with pictures of infamous mobsters and the boothes are all red velvet and leather.  The food. My. God. The. Food. Take a lactaide before you get there- these people are serious about cheese. And garlic. This is everything you love but know you shouldn't about Italian cusine. I highly recommend the bruschetta (a beautiful harmony of tomatoes, onion and pesto with a bit of a kick) and \"The Chef Sleeps with da Fishes\" (an alfredo dish with at least a dozen large, tender shirmp swimming in creamy cheesey goodness).   This is a great place for groups and families. We had a party of 25 including 5 children and 4 teenagers. Everyone LOVED both the food and the ambiance. There was another large group of about 20 and we had absolutely NO problem with service. Everyone was very attentive with the doorman, waiter, busboy and party planner all coming by to make sure everyone was taken care of.   The skinny: Credit cards are accepted. Entrees range from $10.50 for spaghetti w/ meatballs to $25 for specialty dishes Several desserts are available for about $7 each Full bar and good wine selection available Reservations are HIGHLY recommended as the place is not big  **Important note: If you have a group of 15 or more you will have to have a set menu, where everyone pays the same price, starting at about $35 p/p. Children under ten are half price.",

    "text": "Okay here is a review on Cappos.  I have been reading about this place on yelp and was so excited to go there. It is a really cool place super super dark , which Is fine, but the darkness doesn't lean toward a romantic atmosphere , it just leads to an eyesore .  There is a Tiny little flashlight on the menu, but you Have to hold The little button down As You look at the Menu so its kind of tricky to read the menu and hold the flashlight .It's so dark you can barely see your food. Okay so I am a pretty easy going person with not much complaints ,  so let's move on to the decor . Super cool looking inside but looks kind of small , we were seated in a nice booth and waitress and host were super nice, we used a 50 gift certificate from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> which was well worth it . We ordered the calamari with peppers, and the stuffed mushrooms for the appetizers . The calamari was just okay. They tasted like the oil was a little burnt. Now for the stuffed mushrooms. They were really small little button mushrooms that were stuffed with prosciutto and smoked provolone cheese .  It seemed as though if you put your fork in it the mushrooms would fly off the fork and end up across the room  They were okay but it seemed like the chef poured chunks of kosher salt in it. As I did taste chunks of salt.  Now onto the entrees . They were very large portions my boyfriend ordered the carbonara and I ordered the stuffed ravioli. The ravioli was just okay it was cooked with peas and bacon and about 2 lbs of butter. It was way too oily for my tastes . And once more it had  chunks of kosher salt in it . (I don't know why the chef chooses to dress all the food with extra salt if your cooking fresh italian food the flavor comes from the fresh herb cheese and ingredients . Anyway  being that my boyfriend is Italian , we know really great Italian good when we taste it , and overall we were looking forward to a really great Italian meal with great pasta . This Pasta was just okay . It's good to go there for the experience , but not for authentic Italian food.",

The food is absolutely amazing and we leave absolutely satiated! We've tried a lot on the menu, every time we go back we try something different. No disappointments yet. What tops the cake to this amazing ambience experience is the live music of the classics! Keep it up \"fellas\"!",

    "text": "WORST SERVICE EVER AND fOOD IS NO GOOD ANYMORE EITHER.  Ok let me start out by saying I've been going yo capos for about 7 years and it was great back when it was on tropicana. Last year I took my girlfriend for a romantic dinner and we were there for 3 hours and didn't even get our salads, this was due to the fact they were filming a \"real housewife\"eating dinner. So we got a glass of water and I had 1 beer and asked to speak to someone about an hour and a half into it. Noone came so we continued to wait when someone finally came over he tried to give me an attitude and hand me a bill for my food, I looked at him and laughed and said I'm not paying got anything and left and vowed to never to go back. Well needless to say I had to give my favorite restaurant for 7 years one last shot me and a group of 10 friends went there on sat. For my birthday dinner everyone said there food was not good including mine, I had the veal parm and there was a pound of cheese covering it to start, it was very bland and not the same as the old recipe. We were there waiting for out check for an hour after we ate w didn't even see our server, and the place only had 3 tables of people so it's not like they were busy. I would never recommend this place to anybody anymore. What happened to you guys ?",

When you first walk in you have to press this door bell and they let you in by unconventional means. It was dark and had the authentic feel of a speakeasy. They give you a small flashlight to view the menu because it is so dark; it feels as if it was all lit by candlelight. The service was good and I went with my boyfriend and he got the singer to sing us a song so that is always a plus. To those who complain about the darkness or the attitude of employees.... you shouldn't go to a SPEAKEASY themed restaurant if you aren't prepared for the atmosphere and workers. The restaurant is pricey but worth it. I would recommend it as a place to go if you are on a date or celebrating with family and friends.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time on 8/16/14. I love Italian food as my girlfriend is old school Italian and cooks her ass off for me. Love the mob them and the entrance is wonderful and unique. As you go in, you see the bar first and all the memorabilia from the wise guys era. The booths are old school and at this point everything is awesome. However, I am not a I need a flashlight to read your menu kinda guy. I am sure this is part of the ambiance, but It is not for me. Perfect place for a first date. We sat down and had our waitress (cant remember her name) she was kind and nice and very obnoxious as a old school waitress from back East should be. She stated that she had been there for over 13 years so that tells me about the loyalty here as this is not found in the food business anymore so my hat off to these people for treating their employees right. My son and I had the Lasagna and my girlfriend had the raviolis. The salad was on point and the bread was excellent. Before our food came we got the treat of the magician on staff. He is WONDERFUL if you have children and his tricks blew my mind as I sat 1 ft away. The singing is awesome (everything you would expect from an Italian joint) and overall at this point a wonderful dining experience. Our food came and I have to tell you, this is the first Lasagna that I had to eat slow so I could savor how delicious it was. My son stated the same and its just lasagna for Christ sake. I have had this dish at least 500 times from my girl and had to hurt her feelings \"BABE YOUR LASAGNA SUCKS COMPARED TO THIS\"..... dinner was over and we had the cannolis. EXCELLENT....took them home so the little ones could indulge. Prices were a little steep for the food to price ratio. I will deff be back as I cant wait to try a more difficult dish. Again, your going on a first date, this place will break the ice for you up to 80%....I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CAPOS ITALIAN CUISINE......",

    "text": "Saw this place on TV and had good reviews so we wanted to check it out. We didn't have a reservation but got straight in , we had a 10 year old with us so they sat us in a side room closed off from the main part of the restaurant that had plenty of tables available. This was a let down considering we could hear the entertainment of live singing and music and everyone enjoying it while we were stuck in a extremely dark boring room watching the dishwasher through an open curtain. Apparently there not big on having kids in the establishment. It took our waitress about 10 min to take our drink order and then an additional 15 to come back to take our food order. We got our soup and salads shortly after which were not impressive at all but we were looking forward to our entrees...... 50 minutes later we were still sitting there in the dark with one other table with kids bored out our minds and starving. We asked our server how much longer it would be and were told \"2 minutes\",  ten minutes had gone by and the table aside of us who got there well after us received there meals first which were steaks and pastas! Obviously we were extremely frustrated at this point and told another server who was trying to pacify us by saying our food was coming out now that we were done with the situation and leaving. We offered to the manager to pay for our sodas and soups/salads and he treated us very rudely as if we were the problem saying our food was coming out in 2 minutes! We explained to him our frustration and he acted as if he could care less, he told the owners brother the situation n they both kept there backs turned to us not giving us an answer to how much we owed, they finally told us not to worry about it. In no way shape or form did they try to make our experience better or make up for the fact that our order had been placed literally over an hour ago n we had yet to receive our meal. We will never return!",

    "text": "New chef = lots of changes, not for the better. (This review's visit: April 2013)  The Italian dressing that was SO good, circa the previous chef is now completely different. Now: inedible (greasy, yellow, tasteless and, just...No). Garden salad ($6) was made with rusty, wilty lettuce, carrots were stale. Nothing in it was fresh.   Lasagna - check out my pic. I was expecting a luscious, beautiful, hearty, home-made hunk of well-made lasagna (for $10).    During this lunch service, only two other tables were occupied in the resto, but still my server couldn't get things off the ground. We spent the next 45 minutes trying to deal with one thing after another: funky new dressing, funky salad which he accidentally charged for as it was a swap for the pasta, we ordered a meatball but no meatball arrived, waited another 20 minutes for that lasagna to get boxed up, etc... Too much management required. Oyy.  My previous stellar review, which I was delighted to write, belonged to the previous chef. I was expecting a repeat experience, but this was like a different restaurant.",

    "text": "We came here for my son's 21st birthday celebration and thought it would be a nice, but different, dining experience. We were rather disappointed with the whole experience.  First of all, this was supposed to be a speakeasy type of place reminiscent of the mobster days.  Imagine my surprise when they seated us at a table and the head of the table was facing away from the door!  Rule number one:  gangsters ALWAYS seat FACING the main entrance door so they know who is coming at them and if they have a weapon! Being from Central California, I brought my own wine:  a magnum of a 1998 Silver Oak, Napa Valley.  I am used to paying corkage fees in California-  $15 to $30 dollars in the nice restaurants.  But I was charged $60 for corkage because they \"had Silver Oak there\".  I pointed out that it was a 21 year old magnum of the Napa Valley grapes (as opposed to the Alexander Valley grapes).  This didn't faze them at all-- or maybe they didn't understand the difference.  At that point, I didn't care since I had carried it on the plane from California specifically for this dinner so had them open it anyway. Now, on to the food: I had the drop duck egg soup-- way too salty! My boneless rib eye steak was so fatty and sinewy that I couldn't eat half of it. The mashed potatoes was just so oily and greasy-- no wonder they make you eat in the dark! Overall, I will never go back to that place-- not when there are so many delicious steak restaurants on the strip.",

Made reservations for a table for 5 on a birthday.  Got put in a booth, 20 mins for appetizers to show up (calamari, antipasto, bruschetta). We place dinner order at this time. 20 mins later soups and salads. 30 minutes later I have to get someone because server was missing and ask where the order was. 40 MINUTES LATER only one entree comes out. Mor excuses 15 more minutes go by and the rest of the order comes out. Total order;  3 lasagna, 2 ribeyes $40 ribeyes are less than an inch thick.  And over cooked.  I'll buy mine Sam's club and not be disappointed thank you.   Two of my kids fell asleep.  Complete failure.  Still paid full price. Fleming's made a mistake on ONE steak and comped ENTIRE meal.

Portions sizes were big and I was happy to have left overs. Other dishes my party ordered was the chicken Alfredo and uncle Pauly's arrabiata. Both were delicious as well. Warm ciabatta with butter was served as we sat down. I decided to try a bloody mary. Not the best that I've had but it's up there. Only downside is that it's very dark inside. However, each menu comes with a mini flashlight which help. Good service. Definitely will be back when we come back to Vegas.",

We went through the whole password at the back door and going through the secret door featuring a payphone attached in front of it. It has the whole mobster, dimly-lit environment. I had to ask a busboy nearby if we would ever see our server! We waited over 20 minutes before our server, Kaitlyn, finally emerged from her long winters nap. In fact, we'd waited so long for her that we'd finished the complimentary bread one of the runners brought us. When I mentioned to her that I had requested drinks from the maitre'd, she curtly replied that,  \"Well, he's the maitre'd, and I'm your server and I'd like to take your order 'if I may!' \" She was very bellicose and argumentative, likely because she knew she'd been ignoring us. I ignored her sheer rudeness and asked her questions about items on the menu. We ordered garlic cheese bread for an appetizer,  and she said she'd return to take our dinner order. She finally brought us our first round of drinks and then disappeared into the shadows of the place. Another 20 minutes later, she finally returns to us to take our dinner order. She advised us we'd have to pay an additional ten bucks to share a 24 dollar plate of lasagna with my wife. We told her we would continue reviewing the menu. We would never see her again. I watched her service four other tables at least three times each while completely and maliciously ignoring us. When I'd finally decided I'd had enough of Kaitlyn's rude and reprehensible treatment, I got up and asked the maitre'd for our check for the appetizer. He politely said it was on the house.   I cannot possibly fathom how or why a town built on customer service would employ such a woefully inadequate and mean-spirited server. She should be far away from any customer contact. I wish I could give this place less than a full star, for that don't even deserve that!  AVOID!!!",

    "text": "I don't want to be a spoiler, so I'll write a review without getting into many details ;-)   First of all, I found this restaurant thanks to Yelp! My family and I visit Las Vegas a couple times a year and we make sure we visit Capo's. It's been now 3 years! And I've never been disappointed!   The place:  Capo's is like a cute Italian restaurant from the old days. It is dark but that's part of their ambiance, they do have lights for people to read their menus. Some days during the week they have live music, a piano player who sings and tells stories.   Food & drinks:  Capo's is famous for their \"giant meatballs.\" I've had them at least 3 times. Always love them and order them to share with friends as an appetizer. I think is amazing how they make big meatballs but Cook them right!   The pasta here is made from scratch and it tastes really good! One day I had their \"Capo's Lasagna\" and now I can't eat anything else from their menu. That's all I always want! This Lasagna is the bomb! Is so good! So much beef, so much cheese and the most incredible lasagna sauce. I just love it!   During our last visit my husband had \"Chicken Marsala\" with spaghetti. I had a bite and omg one of the best Marsala sauce I've ever had. The spaghetti was great as well! They put just the right amount of sauce so you could enjoy the Marsala.     The drink menu has a some cocktails, I've had \"The Nico,\" -it's fruity and made with rum! It's my fave here.  \"The cosmo\" -with vodka and it's ok  \"Italian Margaritas\" -really good here! I like them a lot!    They have some great \"Tiramisu\" - I love it! It was puffy, creamy and right amount of coffee. It is a generous slice so I recommend to share :-)   Service:  The staff here is funny and attentive. You have a host, a server and somebody in charge to get waters and take the dirty dishes and glasses.  I love the staff uniforms! They all look fancy and good looking!   Bonus:  When you check in with Yelp you get $10 off your bill if it's at least $75. Who doesn't love a good deal?",

We just used the torch light from our iPhones.    We started off with a couple of appetizers, fried calamari and antipasto salad.    The calamari was very fresh and tasty.  The salad was very good as well.  My husband ordered lasagna and I had medium rare fillet with mash potatoes and grilled asparagus.   The other couple ordered a couple of pasta dishes.     My husband's lasagna was a big portion, enough for two.   I am not a fan of pastas and heavy sauces but I liked the taste of this lasagna and the meat sauce.   My fillet was delicious and was cooked perfectly.   Grilled asparagus was good.  The mash potatoes tasted good but had too much butter so I only took a bite of it.   Also, I had to scrape off a big chunk of butter on top of my steak.     Overall, we all had fun evening and enjoyed our food.  Just wished the place weren't so dark.",

I went for a birthday party and all of our food turned out great. The only thing that did not go well was paying. They allowed us only split the check with two cards or one card and cash. Then we discovered that you can only pay with a chip card after that. It was super inconvenient as we were a big party and not prepared for. We had a reservation for 8 people (I just feel like they could have told us ahead of time). It was a nice, a little higher end so we were just surprised.",

There was live piano and singer.   We had reservation but still had to wait for half an hour for our table. We were seated right next to entrance and kitchen. It was stuffy and kinda smoky, not the best seats.   Loved the complimentary bread.   Got shrimp scampi for appetizer and it was the best! The sauce was buttery and garlicky. I could eat this everyday!  Pasta comes with salad or soup. Duck soup was great.   The chef sleeps with fish pasta: disappointing. Pasta was overcooked and bland. I added a lot of salt and still couldn't save it. Ended up only eating the shrimps.   Meatball: enjoyed the sauce. Meatballs decent.   Veal parm with pasta: bf loved it. I liked the pasta more than veal cuz the sauce was sooooo delicious!   Lava cake: kinda spongy n didn't melt very well in the middle. Next time I wanna try tiramisu.",

    "text": "Very disappointed.  For over a year my friend has been raving on about this restaurant, the amazing food, the fantastic live music (piano, singer) and atmosphere you won't forget. We had an older business contact coming to town from Houston & I thought we'd impress him with a dinner at a speakeasy.  I was told to make reservations well in advance, 1 week ahead seemed to be no issue, yay. Very impressive outside entry cove with wanted posters, old closed sign on the door and a sign to ring the door bell which we did, and then we waited.  The door greeting was fun, we entered, our table was not ready so we decided to sit at the bar.  The bartender was very pleasant, knowledgeable, quick, (not very busy) & she poured a good drink.    That was the best of the evening.  Our table was in a booth and was located right behind us from the bar.  This seemed ok, liked falling off the barstool to the table if we needed that, or being close to the door or the restroom if we needed that, but we didn't.  I know we are old, but we are not THAT old!  Unfortunately, we were too busy talking to realize that this table was out of range of the music and not having been there before, it apparently is also the land of forgotten service.  The majority of the dining is further in the building.  Not seeing this area, I have no idea if they were slammed for dinner, if they were understaffed, or if we were just forgotten. The other issue is the table size.  We were in a booth that seated the 3 of us fairly comfortably.  I need to add that this restaurant is DARK.  The floor is dark, the tablecloth was black, the cushions were black...... you get it, a speakeasy.  Our table was round and small, and you'll find it hard to believe me, but as appetizers were brought out and Nicole (sorry if I've spelled your name wrong) was moving items around, there was so much black linen that I misjudged the table size and almost moved a small plate of silverware right off the table.  That table size was barely enough for 2 people.  Our plates, drinks, water and whatnot were all over lapping each other. Food wise, Mr. Houston loves linguini and ordered an entree that included two options.  He received only one of the two.  Grumble, grumble, requested the other and it did come, the linguini was good.  My partner had salmon and said it was delicious. I have never been more embarrassed, I'm old enough to know to go first and check out a restaurant if you are going to wine and dine someone, especially if they are buying.  At the end of dinner, our Houston contact just wanted to go back to his room.  End of evening.  I think I'd like to go back and sit with the \"adults\" and enjoy the music.  The 1 star boils down to very poor service, being seated (having made a reservation 1 week in advance), in a crappy location that should have been for 2 people instead of 3 and order mixups.  There were 2 but I saw no reason to continue on that road.  So now I pray that Vinnie doesn't come hunt me down & break my kneecaps!",

    "text": "Yes, we really wanted to like this restaurant. Always looked really intriguing when we drove by. Read the reviews had four stars, so we figured yes let's try it. It was Mother's Day we took my 87-year-old mom there. When we arrived it is a  speakeasy themed. As you enter the  front door there is an the inside door. One has to ring the bell, a  guy opens the little window to peer out and greet us. Really cute . Trouble Is, No one answered. We waited five minutes, ring the bell again, still no one answered. It took 10 minutes for someone to come to the window and let us in. Once inside, the  a atmosphere was fantastic, full of charm and character. The the host said follow me and as we started to, but he disappeared. Mind you, my mom is 87 and very slow at walking. We waited 10 minutes. Meanwhile we see in the distance people  seated being served. Finally the host came back in and told us once again to follow him. He sat us down in the lounge area where the bar is. We sat for at least 15 minutes before our waitress came by. She told us the special, and I asked her about wines. She was not sure of the Italian wine selection, she said that bartender was on break but she would get right back to us. We waited another 20 minutes at least. At last a nice gentleman brought us some water. I asked \"please could you find our Server? \" He said he would. When server came back, she was very annoyed and curt, we ordered wine politely and we decided we better order our meal too, because we didn't know when we see her again. Another 20 minutes went by before our wine appeared meanwhile our salads came. We saw a wine bottle and three glasses sitting on the bar, we were so close, we could've picked it up and brought it to our table, but we were hoping that she herself by bringing it to us. She, instead was talking to the bartender and walked away, to who knows where. The place was not that crowded. The bartender was very busy which is understandable, but she herself brought us a bottle of wine and poured it. She was very nice. In the meantime main dish came, It was mediocre at best.Tasted like Olive Garden. That's fine, but if I'm dining at a restaurant $25 a plate, I expect something extraordinary. Two different male waiters delivered our food,  both were very nice. We couldn't eat all on our plate so not finding our waitress anywhere again, I asked the bus boy if we could have it boxed up to take home. Someone else came back with the boxes and said here you go! We had to fill them ourselves. Now normally, I would not mind doing this. But, at $25 Plate I expect that  they would box it up for us. This is not a cheap restaurant. Yet another gentleman came by and asked us if we wanted coffee, We said yes, and could we see the dessert menu. He came back and apologized saying the coffee is almost empty and he had to make more. At that point we should've just said forget it, but no being gluttons for punishment, we said that's OK. He also gave us only one menu for the 3 of us to share  We waited again what seemed forever. Our waitress finally came round zooming by. We asked if our coffee was ready and when she had a moment could we have two more menus. She shot us a smart look and said well it takes a while to make the coffee, threw 2 more menus at us. We ordered desert from another gentleman that came very out quickly, creme brulee. But no coffee. The bus boy looked and saw we had a dessert but no coffee, he talked to the waitress she shrugged her shoulders, and he dashed in to bring our coffee. He apologize profusely, we said it was OK because honestly, he was the only one that was on top of it. We finished, and waited for the check,  for 20 minutes. No server. We asked the manager For the check. And he said right away. Our original server, came by about 15 minutes later and she slapped the check on the table without looking at us or saying a word and ran off, huge attitude. We are not hard people to please, but this was totally unacceptable. The dinner came close to $200 for lousy service. I say it's a racked up tourist trap. if I could've given the rating a big fat zero I would've. The only reason I gave it to stars because the atmosphere was really cool.",

You feel like you walked into an old hang out where all the mobsters would go to drink and listen to a live band. We ate here for my sisters 32nd birthday and she couldn't get enough of the decorations and atmosphere. I had the chicken parmesan with spaghetti. The chicken was HUGE! It was a little pricey, $25, but I had so much left over it was basically two meals. The meal came with a salad first and I tried the creamy garlic dressing which was very garlicy but yummy. Before the meal they served warm bread with olive oil and vinegar and the bread was nice and warm!! I spoke with the waitress, Sara, when I went to the \"restroom\" to order a cheesecake for my sisters birthday dessert surprise. When they brought it out with the candle lit up the band sang to her Frank Sinatra style! We will definitely be going back.",

Then a person from the side opens a little window and asks what you want. You give them the code phrase. After asking us if we were followed to which we laughed and said no, he opens a secret door and let's us in. The decor was perfect. Dimly lit with red and black. The menus had a mini flashlight attached so you can read the menu. The walls had lots of mafia pictures up too. When music wasn't playing on the speakers, a piano player was playing. Perfect music to make you feel like you were in a different era.    Food wise: we had fried ravioli as an appetizer that were to die for. So good. I loved the names of their dishes too. It was definitely a theme. Some of the other temptations (appetizers) were \"Bust a cap\" (mushroom caps ) and \"Mafioso Caprese\".   For dinner we ordered from their Man Made Man Pastas menu. I had the \"Uncle Paulys arrabiata\". My friends had \"the chef sleeps with the fishes\", \"Rat pack pesto\", and \"Vinnies ala vodka\". All of our food was absolutely amazingly delicious.   This place is a must see in my opinion and by far the best food I had in Vegas.",

Super down to earth guy :) There was a guy on keys back in the day and I'd sit with him and sing a few Italian tunes I have!   Atmosphere? Capo's.... Al Capone. I mean, he really nails it when it comes to capturing the essence of how things were run back in the day. The mafia flare and history, with a sense of friendly customer service!   Now the food? Tonight we had the cheesy garlic bread. I had the Chicken Luchesse. My mother had the Angelo, and my fiance had the parmigiano. I heard not one single complaint! Even though the kitchen was slammed that night (we were seated at the bar in front of the cooking line) everything was presented beautifully. One mistake was my fiance had ordered mushroom risotto but they forgot that and did spaghetti. No problem there! They brought a side of mushroom risotto right out for him....   Mushroom Risotto was definitely my favorite and seemed to be the general consensus. It was creamy, rich, and buttery. The consistency of the risotto was that of a pilaf compared to a calrose or jasmin rice. nom nom ...   My fiance definitely said it was the best chicken parm he's ever had. So expect us to NOW frequent this place yet again.   Mom enjoyed her chicken Angelo. Lighter in flavor but the wine reduction leaves you wanting more.   We shared cannollis at the end of the night, leaving my fiance with the chocolate cake. If you're wanting a wonderfully thick yet moist fudge cake, this is what you want! It's really rich, but if that's your thing, go for it. I don't have a huge sweet tooth, but my fiance certainly does. The plain cannoli had a hint of cinnamon. So good! :)",

We did have to have reservations to get in and that had a cancellation so we were able to get in that night. Mainly they say they are booked at least a week out. Once your inside you cant see outside at all its rather dark and chilly (so if you get cold easily then you better bring a coat). I like colder places but it was chilly in there. They have a pretty good selection of food mostly Italian, but some other options as well. They also have really good well drinks and wine also. The service was very well up to par they kept drinks full and waiters were always asking if we needed anything. It was crowded but that makes sense its not a too overly big place inside. They have good portion sized food I had their lasagna and man I didn't really how big of a peice you get. We had appetizers too next time we will skip that, because the food portions are good. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a neat little \"mob style\" dining!",

The food was coming out extremely quick, we weren't even done with our apps when our soups came out, we weren't even done with our soups when our mains came out. It felt super rushed!!! Our server was great except he disappeared for about 30 minutes and eventually someone else had to come check on us. But WORSE OF ALL, THE HOST!!! I wish they would get someone who is actually there to do their job!! He was rude and was more concerned with looking like a customer by sitting on the bar then focusing on the real customers. Not to mention, my wife asked him if they could sing happy birthday, he said yes but we had to buy a dessert! The portions are so big that by the end we didn't want a dessert but apparently that was the only way to get a song so my wife insisted. The dessert we had was okay but we did it just for the happy birthday song which NEVER happened which means the host forgot to write it down and tell our server, extremely unprofessional! It made us even more mad when we saw the table next to us also get a dessert which came out with a birthday candle!! Needless to say you're paying to have dinner inside a museum because the service we received specially by the host who didn't seem to care was pretty bad. We were really excited about going to Capo's but I doubt we'll be back again!",

    "text": "Atmosphere: It's set up to be themed like a Mob Speakeasy and I absolutely love the theme down to the trick door.  We went on a Sunday night and the dinner crowd was beginning to thin. It was extremely dark. How dark? The some of the menus had flashlights attached to them.  They had a live performer singing and playing the piano which I thought was a nice touch.  Food: I really wish I could say I enjoyed the food here. Maybe it was because we came on a Sunday night or it was just an off night for them but I was not impressed at all. Food was comparable to your local Olive Garden.  We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. My comment about it being comparable to Olive Garden might be harsh but this dish is exactly why I said it. The color and texture both reminded me of the calamari at Olive Garden.  Our main dishes were the Vinne's Alla Vodka and Santucci's Pasta.   Santucci's Pasta was very plain. I don't understand the hype about Capone's sauce. Short of them accidentally serving us another sauce on it I was not impressed.  Vinne's Alla Vodka was just disappointing. I'm a sucker for Vodka sauce so I hoped this would be the saving grace. It wasn't. The penne taste like it was only half cooked.  Service: Through it all I can honestly say it was the service that saved this from dropping to a two. Our waitress was absolutely amazing. She gave us a heads up about wait times and when were done even offered to call us a cab. Unfortunately we weren't the only tourists there and kept getting our cabs stolen by other patrons.  11pm came around and our waitress saw we were still waiting outside. The restaurant closed at 10pm. She waited with us until our cab came and got us.  Overall: I don't plan on going back. One and done was enough for me.",

My 2 colleagues also thought the same thing.  The atmosphere and the ambience was top shelf.  I had the Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata which was to die for of you like some spice in your pasta.  The salad was also really good.  No appetizers because we figured the entrees would be sizeable which they were not but the salad and pasta were the perfect portion and the perfect price.    I will most definitely be back to this place to eat, drink and feel like I'm in Chicago in the 20s.  Can't for wrong here.    1/25/2017: Still amazing.  Great vibe, great service and some of the best Italian in Vegas.  Couple that the ambience of the music and a local magician performing some table tricks while waiting for our food was a nice touch.  Plus the fact that the prices won't break the bank makes it even more inviting.  The only caveat is if you wish to go with a small or large group, make reservations.  This places fills up fast!",

    "text": "I recently had the chance to have dinner here with a friend from out of town. I have heard many a story so off we went.      I found from other reviews that reservation are a sure fire way to go. so I made our reservations and got the password. Others had stated that with out a reservation there visit was not as enjoyable as it should have been. So off we went with password and info in hand..    When you get there its just a rectangle building nothing fancy, and you really don't have to hunt for the door its pretty easy to spot. Once you enter the whole mob atmosphere is in full play. Dark mysterious and a bit unknown. I wont go into to much here as its an experience in itself, But ring the bell and wait...      Once your inside, its a very lively place.. you enter by the bar and its all old school inside. and the matradee takes you to your table. Now had I known there where 2 rooms I would have requested the main room when placing my reservation. The back room is small and you can not see much if anything that is going on int he main area. Its also seems to be where the place you if you brought your kids..( which I do not recommend ). And it is right by the entrance to the kitchen so a bit busy and noisy. But it does have its own charm.      All the chairs and booths are covered in red velvet, which was a nice touch. The music is mostly from a live singer who is doing all the Sinatra hits for the era. We could hear him but not see him as he walks around and sings.      Now I had heard some really bad things about service, so I was prepared. We sat for a what seemed about 10 min with no one addressing us, I was hmmmm, but then a waiter came to the table and got our drink orders and appetizers. Did mention its dark in there? they give you little flash lights to read the menu by.. Thought is was different. The rest of the night waiter service was excellent. Never had to ask for anything. So slow start but nice recovery.     They bring you out bread service, which is nice portion of a fresh sourdough. Or apps and salads where out in a rather timely fashion and where outstanding. I recommend the garlic bread and sauce, I don't know how they make the sauce but it was one of the best I have tasted in a long time. Our meals arrived to the table timed perfectly. The portions are large but not over bearing the plate. plenty to take home. Food was hot, plenty of sauce and delicious. Again the lasagna was fantastic and if you order a meatball its about the size of a softball..  Its a meal by itself.      We where asked if we would like any desert and we passed as there just was no more room. we where not hurried at that point either. we finished our drinks and chatted a bit and then decided to head out. as we got up from our table we where thanked for coming in and we made our way to the main room. at this point we where escorted to the exit. Much like you would have been in the day. you exit through side doors to the parking lot. As we where leaving we took a few minutes and just looked around the room..  lots of old photos and posters.. you really get the feel that the Mob bosses may have been in a corner booth conducting business..        I highly recommend you give it a try, if nothing else just for the experience. And don't forget the password!! the guy at the door doesn't like that..",

Food was delicious! Definitely recommend the meatballs and chicken Parmesan, as well as the cannolis yum!   When we were first seated we did have to wait almost 20 minutes to be served and even receive water. This was frustrating and the main reason I only gave the restaurant 4 stars. Once our waiter was able to come by the rest of the service was good- he checked on us regularly and was able to provide us with great recommendations as well as make us feel welcomed.   The added touch of the Sinatra singing is a plus. If you want to visit a classic Italian restaurant with great food- this is the place. What a fun experience!",

They do some fun things here (I won't give it away incase you haven't been here before), if your out for a nice romantic dinner or suggesting the same to someone this is the place for sure.   Although it's really more of an italian resteraunt  for dinner we had the two specials that night which were Halibut and a Filet. I had my heart set on pasta when we arrived but was absoluately not dissapointed with the specials. They totally met expectation. Service is always impeccable, we'll be back again soon for sure",

Then let me tell you that I'm from Chicago and I know great Italian food. Capo's experience has made me proud to say this is now my favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. I ordered the meatball appetizer and it turned out to be 2 huge meatballs. They were fantastic and could be an entree. It came with soup, I chose the Italian egg drop soup. Then the veal parmigiana came . It was the largest piece of veal I've ever gotten. It was tender and so good I ordered one to go for my lunch the next day. And they have a singer who was very enjoyable. My server was Erin who was great and I suggest you ask for her. All in all I have become a Capo's regular. GO THERE, you won't be sorry.",

Unfortunately, this place is so out of the way that it has to resort to deals to get anybody off the strip and that makes me really sad. We were fortunate to come in on a \"Sinatra Sunday\" when they had a man singing Sinatra live and wow - he was just amazing, sounded almost exactly like Sinatra - he was even taking requests!  There weren't many people there so our waitress was fairly attentive, we had our bottomless mimosas refilled to our hearts' desire. The breakfast food was average, but that's not why we went. The live music coupled with the dark interior, Prohibition era decoration, photos of mobsters, and even an entrance where you have to knock to be let in - really made this an awesome experience for us, I would recommend it as a must for anybody visiting Vegas and looking to get off the strip.",

I won't spoil all of the surprises, but walking in is like stepping back into time, with a great, dark, \"mobster\" feel. If you are vegetarian, spend the extra $5 to add a veggie meatball to any entree, you won't be sorry. Fast, friendly service. 1 star taken off for overall experience, because we were seated in a curtained off area which seemed like \"overflow\" back by the kitchen and it was pretty noisy. Not a huge disappointment, because it was not our first trip to Capo's. Hopefully we will be back to Vegas, and it won't be our last!",

The noise from both the kitchen area and the outrageously loud music made any conversation impossible.  Service was very slow and when requested butter for bread, it took a second request to provide it.  Server, after taking order, only appeared once to inquire if all OK. The extremely dark atmosphere may be part of the restaurant theme but made for a great tripping hazard -- could not see where you were going.  I got the impression the extreme darkness was possible a cover up for cleanliness. Food was OK but not worth the dinner menu pricing.  Definitely would not recommend.",

The evening started out on a positive. Liked the idea and the decorations and atmosphere, but the food was sub par for the price. It said steakhouse so I ventured for the $40 steak. My friend had to change her order due to them being out of food and she was also not impressed with the selection.   We did make reservations and asked about the special to make sure it was still going on when we called. We were assured it was. However, after we ate the waitress brings the bill and after inspection find out the special was not honored.  She then told us that the special was for locals only and we were clearly not locals.   They did finally honor the discount, but not without complaint.  The waitress told me that \"next time I just need to be aware\". Maybe I should've read more reviews or maybe they should mention that when calling to make reservations.  Either way there will be no next time for this patron.",

The meatballs were ENORMUS and yummy. We finished off the lunch by sharing a tiramisu. I had not previously been a fan of tiramisu but it was incredible.

We had a large party and they refused to split the check, we had to calculate the bill tax & tip. Then waitress got an attitude with us because she had to wait for us to figure out the bill. Such a shame. This is 3rd time I've had this experience here. Doubt the 25 people in our party will return.",

    "text": "The food wasn't bad, in fact it was decent but not as good as some I have had in Las Vegas. My rating isn't based on the food it is based on the distinct feeling small children aren't \"very\" welcome. Firstly while many people find the \"faux mob\" motif part of the ambience I found it quirky. From having a small window opened to the \"mob whisper\" host. This is their \"thing\" and judging from reviews it is well received so this is MY problem not theirs. My issue was actually that we went late afternoon/early evening with our 3 year old and 7 month old. We were sat by a side door-which was opened a couple of times letting broad daylight into an otherwise very dark restaurant. We definitely were sat \"out of the way\" of everyone-that is the feeling I got. Our server was decent-not great, service was decent. What my rating is really down to is they clearly wanted us out before the \"dinner crowd\" really started and it was painfully obvious. I was a waitress in college so I know about rushing people out/turning the \"four top\" etc and this was definitely the feeling I got. I think an all adult party who liked the \"faux mob\" motif would be received better and quite like this restaurant.",

The ambience was like old-school Vegas, like what you would see in those old gangsta mob movies. I really enjoyed it. There was a guy who sang old school Vegas songs. I was in love, with the ambience, food, and my partner. It was pure magic. I would like to come here again. Hint, hint to my boyfriend. lol ;)",

We've now had this same gal 3 times and I don't understand why she hasn't been fired.  We finally said no more Capos after last nights' dinner.  It's very frustrating to feel stuck at a restaurant for 2 and a half hours solely based on a horrible waitress. It's always fun to have people show up a half hour after you and they're fed and gone before we get our food and sit there with empty drinks. Oh, and my Aunt got her dinner 10 minutes before the rest of us so she sat there waiting for our meals, we told her to eat it or share it because it was a 50/50 if any of us were getting fed at all. Shame on you Capos for allowing just one person to ruin what should have been a simple fun night.",

I love the theme and how you have to enter the place, although the inside is very dark, it's just part of the atmosphere. The singer was very very good and not over bearing. The prices are a LITTLE high but the portions and the quality were FANTASTIC!  Service was not bad, but we definitely had a new server that didn't know how to talk to guests. I'd say he was in his very early 20s and would touch my dad on his shoulder a few times, he's call both of us bro, bud, etc . If it was part of the atmosphere of the place then yea it's no problem but in this case it wasn't. Although he was attentive (which I definitely appreciate) and he was nice and wasn't at all rude, he needs to learn how to talk respectfully to his customers.  All in all he did a good job and he'll learn.   1 thing that was a big disappointment.. DESSERT!  I have been to Noras and now here and both have awful desserts. I tried the Tiramisu here and it was blah!  I haven't met an italian yet in vegas who can make a good Tiramisu, they make it the american way and it's not very good :-(    Other then dessert, we will definitely be back very soon.",

    "text": "Full disclosure: I've been wanting to eat here for at least a year. Capo's owner, Nico Santucci, randomly followed me on Twitter so I took a look into what he was all about when I discovered Capo's. A mob themed Italian restaurant with a speakeasy style entrance? Sold! After finally getting to dine here,  I can say it exceeded everyone of my expectations. I had a reso for 5:30 (highly recommended BTW) and got in using the password (found on their website). It was cool to play along with the door man (apparently I had Auntie G's money) but when we got in he was so nice. It is very dark in there so watch your step. Our table was near the bar but you can see the kitchen so it was a bit brighter than if you sat near the back. Our server, Brandon, was very good, very attentive. One of the ways I judge a restaurant's service is how often my water glass gets filled. Never got below halfway so zero complaints. The food? Unbelievable. I had the Chicken Anastasia with a side of spaghetti. My companion had the lasagna. The Anastasia was perfect. The pink sauce was rich and the chicken was tender. My companion said the lasagna was the best she's ever had by a wide margin. They absolutely do not skimp on the ingredients. I had a bite of the lasagna and it was an explosion of cheese.  The Capone's Secret Sauce was a wise investment by Mr. Santucci. It is absolutely delicious (just ask Adam Richman) There is live entertainment here with a gentleman singing Sinatra tunes. So between the dark vibe and the singing it makes for a great atmosphere. However, be sure to ask to sit closer to the back of the restaurant where it's quieter as the bartenders chatter can take you out of your zone. My companion can be picky so I was afraid she wouldn't care for it but nope. She loved it. Capo's is a place we will be visiting every time I'm in Vegas. Buon Appetito!",

We checked out the website and were really intrigued, it looked fun! Then to top it off, we found a 'Groupon Now' deal that was $25 for $50, so we gave it a shot.  When we got there the entrance was confusing, we thought we were in the wrong place. But we were delighted when we were greeted through the little hidden window and welcomed in. Instantly we knew this would be a place we'd return to. The decor is so romantic, velvet wallpaper, red leather booths, and chandeliers hanging above each table. They had live music by a piano player and later there was a lounge style act while we ate. It really was entertaining rather than distracting, and the music was mostly love songs. Being that it was our anniversary we even got up and danced - I didn't expect this at dinner!  The menu looked good but we ended up ordering both specials for the evening: Filet mignon and halibut with risotto.. They were fantastic! We couldn't believe the food was so good! The wine list was a little pricey, but not totally unreasonable.  The biggest surprise was the service. Our waitress was very attentive, offered suggestions, gave us tastings of the wines we were debating about and was not at all put off when she found out we had a Groupon.  A man came around selling roses, which I think could be annoying if you're not with a date, but for us it was an added feature for an anniversary meal.  We will be coming back soon, esp. because they regularly offer their Groupon. I'd highly recommend trying this place but go on a night that you're up for the entertainment.",

The restaurant took advantage of me because they claimed,Brandon who I had spoken to twice never write down my reservation or noted the fact that he would allow me to use multiple coupons! So now they would allow it but not include the soft drinks which are supposed to be included.  They were supposed to just take my 22 friends orders, instead the waiter asked for add ins of shrimp or meatballs to the various menu items. I objected they went back to each person all declined the add ins except 1 party who they still put on my bill. They yelp offered $10 off $75 or more which they would not give me. Because I used a coupon! My bill was almost $300 plus cost of coupons and I thought this very cheap of them! Food is always great but, the way they treated me was shabby.  By the way they charge $25 to serve cake that I brought with using my paper plates! Cheap cheap cheap",

It was a total of 12 people in our table and only 4/12 people liked their food. First of all the food took about and hour to come to our table, by that time you already just want to get out of the place. Second my pasta was hard and the sauce didn't compliment  the plate at ALL, when we told the waitress that we hadn't enjoy our meal she scattered my plate looking if I had ate any of my shrimps & telling me why I hadn't said anything in the beginning ( okay? But keep it to yourself because it sounded & looked SO RUDE). She did make a discount to our tab , but with attitude. Overall my experience wasn't a great one & I will probably not come back again when I know they are many places with better quality food & less pricey.",

However, I am so glad I didn't read all the details and we went to the location and were surprised.  As much as I want to put all the details of my favorite entrance at an establishment ever on this review, I will refrain so others can enjoy it without expecting it as well.   Once you are seated, you are amped up from the entrance and things keep going up hill from there.  We immediately ordered our drinks and began to look over the exquisite menu.    Only down fall is that we went at dinner time, and I have 2 picky teenagers. They both wanted to order meatball sandwiches, which is only on the lunch menu and you cannot order for dinner.    They were also out of lasagna which would have been a 2nd choice for my kids.    I ordered the chicken Anastasia with a side of spaghetti.  The chicken dish was so amazing.  The chicken was crisp and crunchy on the outside which is so unique and appetizing.  I didn't try the spaghetti, because I am not really a fan of spaghetti (it is always boring) so I took it to go.  Later that night, when I gave in and decided to eat the left over spaghetti, I was absolutely shocked; it was so tasty and flavorful.  No one, not even Spaghetti Factory has such flavorful spaghetti. Oh and my daughter upgraded to the Caesar salad (she let me have a taste) and I was so jealous! It is not your average salad and I was craving it all the next day. My salad had artichokes which was off the hook.   The atmosphere is classy, and since it was dinner, our candles were lit and the lights went down.  We did get to enjoy the piano being played toward the end of our stay.    We love Capo's and cannot wait to go back.",

The host graciously sat us but warned us we were sitting near the kitchen so it might be loud. Male vocalist (lovely voice) was singing Sinatra and my husband kept telling me it was a recording of Sinatra and not live. It wasn't until the end of dinner that he believed me!  Our server had an Italian mafioso accent and he was very attentive. I had the pasta fagioli; it was very flavorful and more broth-like rather than thick which is what I prefer. Also tried the \"Angels with a dirty face\" which is angel hair pasta with prosciutto, peas & mushrooms in a pink sauce (mixing the Alfredo with a red sauce?).  It was perfect as was my husband's Chicken Parmesan. The chicken was so tender he didn't need a knife. He also added a meatball (huge and delicious).   Next time I will make a reservation and sit away from the noise of the kitchen. No, I'll sit anyplace to eat that food again!",

    "text": "I ended up at Capo's after turning up too late to seat on a Sunday night at a couple of other venues.  The decor here is pretty lush ... and I suppose that's the main attraction. Red (or black) curved banquette seating. Black velvet fleur-de-lis reps on gold-foil wallpaper. Lots of dark woods everywhere. Brass & gold chandeliers over the tables. Very dark lighting. That sort of thing.   Adding to it was the ambient music, delivered by a piano player ... on a real piano ... who tickled ivory all across the Great American Songbook.   In certain other ways, the whole old-school Italian message went a wee bit over-the-top. Huge mugshot photos of Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel, Lucky Luciano, Frank Sinatra, et. al. The TV closest to me was running \"Donnie Brasco.\" And half the items on the menu were tagged in similar fashion, such as \"Rigatoni Trafficante\" and \"The Gallows with Clams.\" Yes, the latter is linguine. And there is a bit of gangster theater at-the-front-door, Ring the bell, the greeter opens a secret panel through a small picture hanging on the wall, you ask to get in. Then a door--a door-in-the-wall-that-wasn't-there, not the door-that-looked-like-the-door--opens to let you in. Oh my, Mabel, this must be a speakeasy!  OK that part of the atmosphere, again, seems a little bit too overcooked for my palate. It's not my money, but if it were, I would take that stuff down a notch. I suppose it's for tourist-effect, who'll go home saying this is joint is 'authentic vintage Vegas.' Or something like that.  But the actual dining spaces are very MidCentury gourmet-room lush, and so one can easily overlook all the other.  I went with the Italian house salad, included with the 14-ounce no-bone ribeye, mixed veggies & mashed potatoes. A pretty durn good meal. The salad dressing was seasoned oh-so-well and the ribeye was also charcoaled quite well - and juicy. That was a $40 plate, btw. I took a pass on the 24-ounce porterhouse 'special' at $60. Those prices are a wee bit higher than I would marry to the overall experience, but hardly enough of a difference to call them a deal-breaker.  There's a Tuesday 2-fer-$20-off deal, if you pony up for a couple of cocktails. I am basically immune to alcohol consumption, so I didn't look at the cocktail prices ... and so I can't tell you if the $20 is already buried in them. And there's also a \"Sinatra brunch\" on Sundays from 11am until 2pm. Let's just hope that by \"Sinatra\" they don't mean it's endless shots of Jack Daniels chased with a bowl of olives!  I liked this place, clearly, for the core of its decor and its respectable food. So I think I'll keep it on-the-radar primarily as a solid atmosphere option during an evening out with a lady companion.",

    "text": "I LOVED the idea of this restaurant and a friend who has cancer and can barely get out of his house.  He was very excited to experience this restaurant and show it to me last night.  He made reservations weeks ago.  You walk in and knock and a guy with an Italian accent asks what you want kind of rude which was great.    But once we got in we were put in the first booth so there was no way to watch the entertainment at all.  My friend who is probably not going to get to go out much longer i felt bad because the whole point was to show me the entertainment which we never got to see.   Our waitress although she was very nice was pretty slow and the biggest problem is she barely spoke English.  I believe she was from the middle east. Again extremely nice lady. But we could not understand the specials, her accent was so heavy and she spoke so fast.   We ordered steak and lobster and the lobster and steak  were perfect but the risotto was too chewy and bland.  I make risotto my self and it comes out so much better.  The rice definitely wasn't fully done.    Also it took forever to get our food. Then when they brought out our plates it took another ten minutes to get a knife to cut our steaks.    The waitresses did not ask how our food was.  This place has the best concept ever.  But definitely disappointed with our experience.   I will try this again maybe with my family and update my next experience.   But i do love the concept, I just think if someone who is sick makes a reservation in advanced spends almost 300 in a restaurant should not be thrown in the front booth.  I am sure this place offers a great experience but sadly we didn't get to enjoy it.   Hopefully this was just a fluke and next time we will be treated better.",

They are fully committed to the speakeasy theme, which is cheesy, but fun; a sultry lounge singer, ultra dim lights, & menu items dedicated to mobs and gangsters convey an air of danger & mystique even though your surroundings are totally safe (it's a family-friendly or Girls' Night Out kinda place, to be honest.)   Capo's isn't just all about the theatrics, the food is actually really good...I'm not sure he would agree in regards to his veal Parmesan, but I enjoyed our \"temptations\" (appetizer) called \"Dino's Deep Fried Ravioli\" with tangy pink sauce. My \"Man-Made Pasta, spaghetti & meatballs named \"Santucci's Pasta,\" was indeed well-made (see what I did there?)

I ordered the lasagne with a Caesar salad and my husband ordered the rigatoni with a house salad.  We also shared the caprese appetizer.  Everything we had was fantastic!  My salad was garlicky, which I loved.  My husband's salad with Italian dressing was also good, but he found it to be too salty.  The caprese was composed of some fantastic prosciutto on top of perfectly ripe tomatoes, creamy mozzarella, and fresh basil.  It was quite good.  The rigatoni with Alfredo sauce was very heavy with a mild flavor, but we both loved it.  The lasagna was one of the best I've ever had!!  I think the use of their excellent meatballs in the lasagna is what really made it so excellent.  While I wouldn't rate Capo's as a 5 star restaurant on food alone (I reserve those ratings for the particularly spectacular), the ambiance was super fun and interesting.  It would be a great place for a large group dinner or for a romantic date, and you can't say that about many places.  Highly recommended!",

We saved room for dessert and had the canolis.  Again, just good.  There was nothing above good. Now for the bad.  The service was so slow.  We almost got up and left.  I ordered the Brushetta at the same time I ordered the drinks, which was as soon as we sat down just about.  Everything took too long to make it to the table.  I eat out a lot and when I say it was slow, I have a lot of places to compare it to.  Watching other tables, we saw other people getting impatient waiting for their food. Oh, our waiter, Francisco, was very nice.  Sorry, almost forgot that.",

From the surprise entry to the \"brash\" host you travel back in time. The place is dark with low lights so you get a flashlight with your menu. Great drinks from the bar and live entertainment. The food is really True Italian with the large meatballs and homemade sauce a must try. If your in town and get a chance to go by all means do so.",

I first tried to book a reso for my boyfriend and Is anniversary and open table was booked, tried to call and couldn't get through. My dads in town from Jersey and I figured give it another try. I was blown away!! We entered this speakeasy style room and a little door opened with a guy who's NY style sarcasm made my heart miss home. Not for the easily offended. He sat us to our table and from there Sara and her busser team timed everything flawlessly. My boyfriend, father and I are all in the service industry and were very impressed with the service. If you're nice to them theyll be nice to you! With a sprinkle of wit and sarcasm of course.  The ambiance is perfect. Live singer and I usually HATE dim lighting. There are small flash flights in the menus to help read. By then your eyes adjust and the chandeliers above the tables provide just enough light.  We got a bottle of wine $50 Black Diamond Cab. Standard good, my favorite is The Prisoner; and some apps. The meatballs and cheesy garlic bread are a MUST. We also got the bruschetta which was very tasty! But filled me up quick.  For entrees I got the eggplant parmesan with angel hair, they got a blackened chicken linguine and an angel hair shrimp scampi. All astounding! Truly recommend because I'm a Chicken/Eggplant/Veal Parm snob.  We lastly told our waitress it was my dads birthday, the singer had been coming around continuously throughout the night and then again to sing happy birthday with a tiramisu. Which was so light and delicious!  The communication between the waitress and busser team did not go unnoticed but the experience truly started as soon as you \"ring the bell\" I'd recommend this place to any east coast friend coming in to town looking for a piece of home. 5 stars!",

The restaurant is extremely dark, so if you're not into that for some reason, this isn't the place for you. The menus even have little lights on them because it's that dark!  We started with garlic cheese bread which was yummy! I had the chicken parm with pasta and a meatball. The chicken was delicious and the meatball was very good. The side of spaghetti wasn't anything special.   The waiter was attentive and they were fast with refills, which I like! Overall I think this is a fun place! The first time I visited the restaurant, they had loud music which was way too loud but this time they were playing old songs...which went with the theme of the restaurants. We were there early on a weekend night, so maybe we were lucky to miss the loud music lol.   We used a $10 yelp check in offer, which made our bill $69 for two people.",

Ordered the bust a cap, capo's house salad, Rat pack Italian beef, and Santucci's pasta with meatball.  Bust a cap was okay, nothing special. capo's salad had too much dressing.

I liked how they had a singer and a piano player. By the end of the night we needed to go boxes. Our waiter was awesome and attentive.

    "text": "A Las Vegas institution.  Eggplant Parmesan and all the dishes are from family recipes handed down generation after generation. The Legend and lore of this restaurant must be experienced firsthand. There is nothing that I can say in this review or any other review by anybody else that will give the story of Capo's Italian restaurant, Steakhouse & Speakeasy the Justice it deserves.  To be fair, I must describe some of the unique qualities of this venue. First, it is a speakeasy. You go to the corner of the building marked \"entrance\", ring the doorbell, and wait for the door man to poke his head out of a hidey hole and challenge you for the password. So, in Times Gone by, that was how it was done at a speakeasy. It's probably best to make reservations. It's also probably best to keep an open mind. This restaurant is not like any restaurant you have ever eaten at.  The menu, in all of its Glory, has very catchy names fashion After mobsters and like. The food is of superior quality, in all of Las Vegas very few restaurateurs can challenge the quality of Capo's. And they will not win. Nor have they ever. Sorry to Giada, Mario, and Bobby.  Let me repeat so that it is abundantly clear: this is not like any restaurant you have experienced in the past. The recipes are handed down from Generations. The quality is superior. The experience is exemplary, entertaining, and unique. There is a crooner playing the piano singing the tunes of the greats. Make sure you tip him and everybody else. This is a speakeasy!",

    "text": "You go here more for the atmosphere, they did a great job living up the mob theme.  They even setup an elaborate entrance where you have to knock before coming in.  The restaurant is super dark and they provide mini flashlights for you to see the menus.  If you don't like dark places, avoid this place like the plague.  Expect generous portions, so bring your appetite.  They even provide a lounge singer.  The bread is awesome, it's nice and crispy, served hot... add some butter, it really hits the spot.  The calamari was excellent, only comment is that we wished that they included the squid legs.  The sauce the comes with it had a perfect balance, not too sweet or sour.  The clams linguine \"The Gallows with Clams\" with white sauce is another good entree to choose.  The noodles were firm and sucks up the flavors of the dish.  The clams were on a bit on the side but perfectly cooked.  We had high hopes for their famous meatball with spaghetti, as we hear several servers pushing this dish.  Nothing that says wow gotta get it, but still solid.  You get a big meatball in the middle of a pile of spaghetti.  The meatball was slightly fluffy with yet the density of the meat.  The \"Sawed Off Sausage & Peppers\" was not to our liking.  The red wine is too overwhelming and dominates the flavor of the dish.  So much that even the sausage is not spared from the overwhelming wine flavor.  Why the three star rating?  Our waiter was horrible, barely stopped by to see how we were doing and wasn't helpful at all.  For example, he didn't mention the Tuesday night special, we only knew about it by eavesdropping on another table (I'm a former Auditor).  What saved them was the busboy and other supporting staff that filled in for him.  Also, the prices were on the high side, in the low $20 to $30 range.  As mentioned before it's really dark, it was interesting at first but the novelty quickly evaporates.  It gets irritating not seeing your food before eating (that's how dark it is).   They have a Yelp check in special, be sure to unlock the deal by checking in!",

THe lounge singer was great, not too loud but loud enough to add to the ambiance. Portions are huge by any standard, and you could split an entree and still leave full. I liked the pasta and the sauce they have and recommend it. Overall its a great spot to visit and get off the strip if you are a tourist. don't forget to text and get the password ;)",

    "text": "The mob themed ambiance is so fun & eclectic, if you're down to have an experience during your Italian meal, this is the place.   Came here today for my boyfriends birthday meal. He LOVES this place.   Ordered the calamari to start - the best I've found in town, it's DELICIOUS - not rubbery at all, fresh and the breading is perfection.   Chris ordered the shrimp scampi, which if you're looking for traditional scampi swimming in butter - won't disappoint. I ordered the shrimp fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes and pancetta in a garlic sauce. Yum!   Chris did order a couple beers & I feel like $7 for a bottle of Michelob Ultra is ridiculously overpriced & the food itself is a little bit overpriced, especially for lunch. Bill totaled $96 for two pasta meals, calamari, and two beers.   Not a complaint because the food never disappoints, service is awesome & the themed environment is so much fun!!  On Tuesdays they do have up to $20 off for locals, so don't forget to ask about that discount.",

Took ages to get any service at our table though, wasn't particularly attentive throughout the dinner.   all 3 of us ordered together, took well over 30 minutes to get food.  Ordered the sausage special, meat and sauce were great but pasta was well under cooked. I pointed this out to server and he offered to have it replaced but I told him I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes... and with that he walked off.   I thought he may have discounted it from the bill, but nothing. Paid the $187 and went on our way.   Wouldn't go back, would rather spend my money at Nora's or any pf Vegas' other Italian restaurants.   Disappointed...",

    "text": "I would have to say I had high hopes for this long-time standing Italian restaurant in Vegas with such a cool speakeasy theme but I was disappointed. Booked a party of 8 last night for my best friend's birthday celebration. The ambiance was very dark and super dim lighting as if to keep you from seeing the food or menu or anything for that matter. The drinks were decent and probably why I gave this place at least 2 stars. The rest of the experience from my point of view was dismal.  My almost $50 Cioppino came with no lobster tail (at first I thought it was minced into the dish) but asked the server, Lolita and apparently it was forgotten.  By the time my lobster tail came out, the rest of my table completed their entrees and the busser even brought out to go boxes for the table!! That's how long it took!  My house salad had wilted lettuce or spring mix. My friend's meatball salad had pasta in it even though he specifically asked for no pasta and when it was brought the server's attention, nothing was done about it.  After all this, the only gesture of goodwill they offered was to provide complimentary dessert for the birthday boy...  If it was not my BFF's birthday and his choice on the restaurant, I would not have chosen this place. Nora's Italian or Eataly at the Park are way better choices of Italian cuisine. Will not be coming back.",

We ate a Wofgang Pucks at theVenetian the night before, which was good, especially since we met the pocket chef himself..He was out glad handing all of his patrons, was as pleasant and charming as you might expect.  I was designated to find the next dinner restaurant, and had my laptop, so i yelped Mario Batali's B & B restaurant which had not so hot ratings by fellow yelpers. So I searched yelp and found Capo's, with two locations, W tropicana and  W Sahara.  Rave reviews from yelpers, so i called to see which was closer to theTreasure Island where we were staying.  Only a  machine at the Tropicana location, but a real person at the W Sahara location.The dude said he was about a mile closer, so we made reservations for five at six PM. easy to find, valet parking which was almost a neccessity because he directed us to the entry, which is a whole other story.  Dark, early sixties/late fifties decor, really great food and a very memorable time.  Piano player/crooner. I don't think you will be dissappointed.   I added this review because although the other location was yelped highly, the sahara location wasn't on the yelp list yet.",

Wasn't good enough to warrant that price and the extra $5 for a average meatball. I don't know why it's \"famous\" because it tasted like bread crumbs to me. Food sat under the heating lamp for 20 minutes before someone finally delivered it. We were there far longer than we needed to be waiting for service and missed a planned event because of it. (No, they weren't that busy) Trying to get in was fun but we were not put in the room showing on the website. It was a side room that wasn't very nice. And if its so authentic why don't they have authentic SWEET Italian sausage. Why is that so hard to find in the west? Lastly, I get checking ID when you use a credit card but taking your license to the back is not necessary. I don't trust it. Bring cash.",

I found out about it through some friends, and they said it is suppose to be the most authentic restaurant in town for italian cuisine.  And they were RIGHT!  We arrived and walked into a corridor where we had to ring the buzzer.  Out of no where, this guy pops his out and asks us \"How ya doin?'\" with an italian accent.  On this friday night, we got the opportunity to listen to Bobby, the live entertainment, at our table side.  Not only that, the waiter Billy, fit the entire motif of the \"mobster style\" dinning.  The food was phenomenal.  I had the scampi, a caesar salad, the sawed off sausage and peppers, and the tiramisu for dessert.  The rest of the family had lasagna, chicken alfredo, and the chicken al vodka.  No complaints, and we all loved the place and will enjoy going back often.  A great experience everyone can enjoy.",

This restaurant is totally different from any other in Vegas, and most especially  the service is what stands out to make it such a great place.  From the minute you walk into this restuarant, it is all about you.  Everyone from the person that seats you, to the servers, to the cooks--you can see them cooking from the bar seats-- the customer and your experience is what matters.  This alone is so much different than most other restaurants in Las Vegas.  This is actually what sets this restaurant apart from all the rest. The decor is great--puts you back into 1960--and so is the food.  Try everything, but most especially you cannot miss the calamari. This place is sure to last because they go above and beyond.  It is not unusual to see the owner and  his wife here; obviously this is an endeavor that matters to them. There are many choices in Las Vegas, but this place is not to miss.",

No hiccups, plateware was removed, our drinks were brought expeditiously,our order was taken. we were serenaded by old-school las vegas musicians who knew just what my fiancee requested they sung directly to me until i would have said yes to anything. dinner followed promptly; we had to wait on nothing thruout the evening UNTIL it came to our desire to have dessert and coffee; there was not a soul to be found. Imagine that, being on the way to 5 stars and then blowing it by not even showing up to ask us about offering us coffee or an after dinner aperitif. waah!. I'd like to think my love was overall happy with his birthday dinner but i had wanted it to go so perfectly. oh well, the entrees were exquisite as always and I can't wait to come back. i hope they will have ironed out the end of the dinner for us return patrons, so we can add a much DESERVED exclamation point to end the evening; thank Nico for his overall 4 1/2 stars service.",

So, I'm excited to go there, and we get there, and we had to wait for 5 minutes after ringing the bell, and snuck in after someone happened to go through the door, to be \"greeted\" by the rudest, scowl faced man stating \"you need a reservation.\" With seats clearly open behind him, and I said \"we have a groupon now...\" to him saying \"Meh. A groupon. Heh. Whatever.\" After 10 min we're seated, with him saying to the waitress \"they have a groupon\" quite snobbilyy. then it took 30 minutes for us to even receive WATER. Then we are told you have to spend $60 to even use the groupon after the groupons been redeemed so you have no choice, then we're told we can't even use 2 groupons or split checks. So it takes forever to even order, and forever to even receive the food. Then, the bread does go stale after 2 minutes and the butter they bring you is very little, and after asking for extra, we don't get any extra. The soup was cold. And the food was very bland, and it hurts yur stomach. The waitress was extremely rude, and the bouncer stands over the entire dinner watching you to make sure you don't share bc then they charge $6. So, I'm sitting through this entire dinner highly tense and not enjoying my dinner at all, I feel like I was about to cry or eve throw up. After asking for the check, the girl unauthorizingly took $16 for a tip for hrself. And for a groupon that was only supposed to be $25 for $50 ended up costing me about $80. And that's not with me ordering extra,, that's with all the outrageous fees they charge. The staff was RUDE. And it was literaly the most unenjoyable experience I have ever had. I have never written a review in my life, but I just HAD to for this terrible hell-hole.",

I made a reservation for his b.d.  What a fun place.  We arrived during happy hour because we had tickets to a show later.  All the house wine, beer and well drinks are half price along with appetizers. I think that is from 4pm to 7pm., not 100% sure about times.  We had drinks at the bar and shared an order of Calamari...(It was huge and so.o.o.o good. ) The dipping sauce was fabulous.   Since everyone said the portions were huge, we decided to split an entree and a desert.  We told our server our intentions and there wasn't an extra plate charge or any problem with sharing.  They even divided the entree into to separate servings which we still couldn't eat all of it....By the way, we had ordered spaghetti with the meat sauce.  The meat sauce was a mixture of Italian Sausage and ground beef...It was excellent...I wish we had this place in Atlanta.  For desert we ordered the Chocolate Molten cake with vanilla icecream  It was so yummy.. My husband is Italian so he loved the Godfather movies playing on the bar t.v. and he loved the singer coming around singing Frank Sinatra songs.  I had read on yelp to request a booth for a romantic dinner so I did and it was perfect.  It was a great evening and my husband loved it.",

Overcharged for drinks - two of them at twelve dollars a piece!  Veal marsala and veal parmagiana substandard.  Sausage and pepper meal was so bad one of us couldn't finish eating it.  Only one member in our party of four was happy - with her lasagna.  Bread was cold and too crusty and flakey.  Soup was okay; dinner salad outstanding. Service was absolutely awful!  The attitude was one of not caring in the least bit about anything.  We made it clear two of us were having birthdays.  After dinner, long after dinner, someone came to the table and asked if we wanted dessert.  I looked at him and said the restaurant was told two of us were celebrating birthdays - to which he retorted, 'no one told me,' and he disappeared, never to be seen again.  Fifteen minutes later I spoke with the manager, and five minutes after that, we were given two brownies with vanilla ice cream, and candles that weren't even lit.  Dinner tab was $140, and we felt terrible for the host that he had to pay such a bill for such an awful experience.  I would discourage absolutely everyone from eating in this establishment - we should have left after realizing it is impossible to see anything inside it.  Shame on these guys for keeping their doors open.",

Both omelets were made from 4 eggs and included home fries and bread, Mad Sam was filled with Italian meatball and sausage with a slightly spicy red sauce was unique and pleasantly different. My wife chose the vegetarian option customized to her taste and said it was the best omelet she's ever had, if you knew my wife you would know what a powerful statement this really is.

It was a lot of fun going somewhere away from the strip and the atmosphere was unique to any restaurant I've been to. The setting felt very authentic to the time period it was meant to represent.  Now for the food. Bread was, well, sliced bread, nothing special, and the butter was cold and thus annoying to spread. We got salads with the garlic dressing which was good, but would have been better with about half the quantity. Our entrees were lasagne and chicken parmesan and we loved them both. The ricotta cheesecake still has my woman kicking her own ass that we only got one slice to go versus two.  Highly recommended for anyone craving Italian somewhere different.",

But I just spent $150.+ $20 tip and $10 for the piano player (because I felt sorry for him) and the food was awful. It began with undercooked calamari continuing to a limp salad then moving on to a tough veal Marsala that was difficult to cut with a steak knife. My husband had spaghetti in a meat sauce that he could not finish. If you have Italian food this is probably the place for you. I just looked at the other reviews of this restaurant and I can't believe it. How could anyone give this place a good review?",

    "text": "I'm going to try and kept this as short as possible. Made reservations, showed up, rang the bell...and nothing. They let my husband and I in with no fanfare or show. Not sure what the \"admittance\" process is suppose to be, but it did not live up to the hype of the previous reviews. Once we were seated (in the back by the kitchen), we had plenty of time to decide what we wanted to eat and to contemplate the meaning of life.  It seemed that we and the 3 other surrounding tables were be handled by 2 different servers but they did not seem to communicate with each other.  Service was spotty at best. The male server was amazing at saying he would bring the items we were missing but then forget. He was like the guy on 50 First Dates whose memory would reset after 10 seconds.  Then after waiting for the female server to come back we would get our items promptly.   Food:  The cheap knock off version of what people think Italian good should taste like.  I ordered Santucci's Pasta with a huge meatball and my husband ordered Da Don's Lasagna.  My paste seemed slightly undercooked and the sauce and meatball had a strange flavor. It was nothing special.  My husbands lasagna was ok but they use the same sauce as my spaghetti.  That would have been fine if the sauce had been good, but it definitely was not.   Entertainment:  There's not a whole lot that I can say about it since we could not see it from where we were seated. I will say that while we couldn't see it, we could definitely hear it.  The male singers voice was blaring over the speakers. It was so loud that my husband and I could not talk without yelling at each other.  This probably would not have been an issue had we been able to see what was going on.  This ended up annoying us more than anything. We were happy when he finally decided to take a break.  They went to canned CD music which was perfect because it wasn't as loud.  Price:  The best way I can describe this is they charge Friday night A team stripper price for the Tuesday afternoon C team.  Overall my husband and I will not be back. There is better food and entertainment in Vegas for less money.",

    "text": "You know you go to Vegas too often when you start heading to Off-Strip places for dinner.   Capo's has evidently been featured on one of those food TV shows and there's definitely a gangster mob speakeasy theme here. Right up my alley, obviously. You ring the bell outside the entrance and a guy slides open a tiny window and asks what you want/what you're doing there, sort of like Robert De Niro's 'whads da matter with ya?' voice.  We didn't have reservations, which you probably should do if you want a table. It was no prob, we got seated at the bar and were fine with that.  It's really dark in here, so much so that the menu includes a little light on it so you can read it.  Good thing I checked out the menu online before so I kinda had a clue!  A bartender was our server, she was really nice and pleasant and checked on us frequently.  I'd tell you she was really attractive too, but again it was too dark to tell, so maybe it was just a guy that had extremely large pectoral muscles. Oh, she (or he?) was really good at making recommendations and answering questions about the menu too.  What we had: bruschetta, calamari, meatballs, and my main course was Vinnie's Alla Vodka.  The latter comes in at a bit under $20 and is what I'd totally recommend. The meatball appetizer also seems to be one of their signature items and is probably something you should give a try.  I know we had a few other things, but this is what I can remember.  Or, maybe it was just so dark that I couldn't see half of what I ate.  Don't forget to check out the decor here too.",

We were seated near the kitchen entrance and patio door so the continuous yelling of \"corner\" by the waiters was quite annoying. Additionally it was very drafty when the patio door was opened. The piano singer was entertaining. Our waiter was polite but not overly attentive.   All and all not the best Italian food I've ever had but not as basic (or gross) as an Olive Garden.",

The only nice thing, was the singer singing \"Sinatra\" songs.\"  This restaurant was dark,(they have tiny LED lights to view menu which are difficult to use if you have arthritis in your hands),  unfriendly,  terrible service, horrible food and were very DECEPTIVE with their bills. This was by far the worst eating experience of our lives. Caution to anyone who does not know the owners! The food was so bad I couldn't eat it. Who ever heard of Pasta Fagiola with crushed spaghetti, no beans and jarred garlic? The eggplant rolatini tasted like old cheese with jarred garlic overkill. I just couldn't eat it. The chicken picata was bland like lemon was squeezed on it. The mushroom risotto was hard and undercooked. My husband couldn't eat his eggplant either! No one enjoyed the food or the atmosphere. Then came the bill. LOCALS BEWARE! Sundays is pasta 2 for 1 (up to $20.00 only). If you don't tell them you're a local, you will be overcharged. Then there's the issue of the bill. It is a light carbon that is not ledgible! There were 2 prices on the bill (hand written). They charged us extra because they said they didn't know we were locals. Well, I let that go. I got back my adjusted bill and credit card back which had a transaction on it. Again it had 2 prices. $130. and $165.  I questioned the waiter again!  He said they included gratuity. Well, the \"gratuity box\" was blank and he wrote \"Grat\" over a preprinted \"Thankyou\" on the bill which was not ledgible. Also, it seemed to all of us that they charged OVER 20% for a TIP! People who don't know are going to be in for a rude surprise....Double tipping! We would never go back to Capo's again. My only mistake was complaining after the meal and paying for that horrible experience. All I got was an apology! Not a compensation by a long shot! And by the way, my bill originally started at $226. and went down to $130. which was still too much for the quality and service  received. Does anyone see a problem with a $96. difference? That's after having the waiter review with us 3 times as to what we were being charged for! I could not in good faith recommend this restaurant! If you're used to good Italian restaurants or Italian home cooking, you will hate this food! There was nothing authentic about it! This restaurant was way overpriced...",

    "text": "Fellow Yelper's hinted my group to Capo's and there was not an ounce of disappointment by this choice. My boyfriend is Italian so I have a tough critic when dining at an Italian restaurant. He was extremely pleased with the selection.   I will be honest that I was a bit hesitant when I saw the location. Capo's is in a ghetto looking neighborhood within a strip mall, off the Vegas Strip. I guess that consoled myself that it would be worth a try when I saw Ruth Chris in the same type of setting, but a couple blocks back.   The entrance to the restaurant is quite fun and interesting. It is a simulated gangster hangout. You have to ring a door bell so that you can be let in. The restaurant itself is dark and you get a little light to read the menu. Capo's offers that very best service that I have seen at any restaurant. Jennine was our waitress and she was knowledgeable, attentive and looked happy to work at Capo's. The restaurant had a busboy, Jeremy who just worked his tail off and made sure that all the customers had all that they needed.   My boyfriend and I shared the lasagna as well as the egg drop soup with spinach. It was excellent. Taste, texture and temperature were outstanding. So far, Capo's is by far the best that we have had.   If only the restaurants on the strip could get the concept of great service and excellent food would they even be able to compete with Capo's.",

We have loved the food and experience but this past week we took a group of work associates to the restaurant and our feelings have totally changed.  We established a group menu and price per person prior to going to the facility.  When it was time to get the bill I was presented a check with a mysterious room charge I was never told about, a price that was $5.00 more per person and a total head count that was 6 more people then were dining (our head count was exactly what we reserved).  I pointed the errors out to our server and she told me the manager who arranged the menu was out of town and she, as the server, could not make any changes to it.  I informed the server I refused to pay the ridiculous over charges.  We spent about a half hour going back and forth (while our paid limo was waiting outside).  I had to go out to the limo, get my phone, and sort through deleted emails to show her that the bill was wrong.  Finally she agreed to reduce the charges.  I have no problem with a manager going on vacation but at least have someone present who can make a decision to correct a wrong!  We will NEVER be going back her again!",

He hadn't been one of the servers of our main courses, and it took a good 10 minutes for the busboy to get the waiter back to our table to take our wine order.  We ended with cappuccino and coffee.

Capos on Sahara is seriously a restaurant not associated with its past by any means.  First upon arrival we were greeted in the interesting way at the speak-easy door by the maitre d.  We did not have a reservation and we were sat within 5 minute upon arrival.   While waiting I will add the maitre d was discussing how they were waiting for Anthony Bourdin to arrive... We were sat and waited a good 10 minutes before being asked if we would like to order anything to drink.  when we finally ordered we were ready to finalize our entire meal order.  I ordered the calamari and linquini and clams.  my husband ordered the sausage ravioli .   We were brought bread which I seriously thought looked and tasted like a crouton.  crunchy and dry. when the wines were served I was unhappily surprised and how small the glass of red was.  for 12 dollars you would think the glass would be served 1/2 full however it was filled 1/4 full and the white was 3/4 full. the calamari came and it tasted frozen and heated through.   we finished the calamari and waited at least 25 min until our entrees came.  i knew after my first bite of the linquini and clams the \"fresh pasta\" wasnt fresh, the clams were very very chewy and the sauce tasted like it had tons of sugar in it.  i have never tasted linquine and clams white sauce quite like this before.  my husbands ravolis tasted ok but again the sauce didnt taste fresh more like Hunts Spaghetti Sauce out of the can. i was looking forward to the bread pudding but after eating the entree i decided that if the appetizer and main were so bad i didnt think capos could recover with a good dessert so we decided to pass. we live quite close to capos and and we decided to leave immediately following dinner.  my stomach was turning and I just wanted to get home.  not 2 minutes upon leaving did I tell my husband that i felt sick.  we were 1 block away from home and i made him pull over.  i could not hold it in , i tried but couldnt .  so with the overcooked possibly spoiled clams, not fresh made pasta, chewy calamari and old bread i had left on the pavement i am here at YELP making sure you all know how horrible my experience was.  I warn all to be very very careful here.   Anthony Bourdin will NOT be impressed!",

Capo's did contact me with my concern's and I now feel that CAPO'S DOES CARE ABOUT THERE CUSTOMERS.  Capo's also informed me that they are changing the way that they bill customers in a large party.  I also was in error on the tip added to our bill.  CAPO'S ADDS 20 PERCENT FOR LARGE GROUPS.  I feel that this is a fair tip for groups.  We always loved Capo's at their other location and will be giving them another try.",

    "text": "STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!  The food is horrible and overpriced!!!  Trust me you will feel like you have been taken by the mob if you eat here. The linguine and clams was swimming in oil, the chicken Anastasia was not a chicken breast but more like a chicken roll like the texture and taste of McDonald chicken nuggets and the pink sauce was disgusting. The lasagna was 2 lasagna noodles with a little bit of meat and runny cheese in the middle swimming in pasta sauce. The eggplant Parmesan was covered in cheese that turned very hard and chewy like string cheese. The pasta noodles was soft and mushy and the red sauce was very bland. The atmosphere and the old Vegas theme was the only good thing about the place but not worth paying for tasteless over priced food.  To sum it up you will feel like a fool for not listening to the bad reviews and dropping your hard earned cash on this crud. And then you will be sitting in front of the computer screen the next day writing a bad review.",

We also gave them a bday cake that they placed candles on and the singer came out with the waitress and sang to me over his microphone. Sounds embarressing but thankfully because of the way the cozy little booth was it was all good. The bathroom was nice and clean. The prices were really good and like I said the food tasted amazing. My only issue was the music was VERY loud so if your looking for a place to just sit and chat. This won't be the right venue for you!",

One of my friends knew the words to \"On the Street Where You Live,\" which led to a duet!  The place is really dark, so they attach little LED flashlights to the menus.  Portion sizes were generous. One friend had a simple dish of angel hair pasta with marinara sauce, and another had the same with Italian sausage added. Both said their dishes were \"excellent\". Another friend gave two thumbs up on the shrimp scampi. I tried the Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata, and as noted in other reviews it was peppery with lots of raw slivered garlic. Caution: you WILL smell like garlic the next day if you order this dish!  Prices were very good. No, it's not the world's best Italian food, but the total experience is very very enjoyable.  From the Strip, it's about a $15 cab fare for a party of 4.",

They had an impersonator singing and that was neat. We ordered 2 milks and the waitress brought us a cup of half and half mixed with water. It was disgusting. Apparently they don't carry milk. But the waitress could have said that instead of trying to trick us into drinking something that clearly wasn't milk. I went to order an item I saw off the online menu and the waitress told me they took that item off the menu 8 years ago. Really? They couldn't update their menu. It would take 5 minutes. I settled for the lasagna and I would say stouffer's is better. Our bill came to $103. My cocktail the size of a shot was $10. They charge strip prices with a Denny's quality type of food. I was very disappointed. I wish I had gone to Tbones and spent that money on quality dining. The air was broke in 105 degree weather. We were so hot and sweating sitting there. They should close the restaurant until that is fixed.",

    "text": "So I just moved to Vegas about 7 months ago. This is one of the first off the strip places I had gone to. Quite possibly the best place out there. The outside resembles what looks to be some piece of crap shed however when you enter the world transforms into a 1920's speakeasy. From the time I entered to the bill I knew I was going to enjoy this place. My favorite is their chicken marsala it is to die for. But back to the atmosphere, its great maybe a little bit to dark but I understand why. The host looks like he just finished a hit on someone based on his size which gives it more of that authentic look. Best part is they have a pianist on certain days, which can sing some amazing Sinatra. The food and drinks yes might be a little on the pricy side but defiantly worth every penny. The wait staff is great two I have had the same waitress twice and both times she was great the other 4 times I went there it was different people yet still really good at their jobs. I even ended up stay after close on day to enjoy a beer with some of the people that worked there. A++ I haven't been to their other location but I can only assume its just as good.",

The best part was of course the food and definitely the Frank Sinatra singer that dedicated songs to me all night since it was my birthday, it was so memorable! Definitely a night to remember!!!!  The staff is very helpful and attentive and the food is to die for! I made reservations for 11 people for my birthday dinner and from the moment we came in the host and the waiters turned all their attention to our every need. By far the best costumer service I have ever received. they made us feel right at home, very welcomed specially our older waiter he was so nice.

Going on, you have to knock on an outside door and someone pops their head out of a side panel to see who you are. After confirming the reservation, you are let into a dimly let restaurant where the decor is clean, cool, and old school (with pictures of mobsters hanging up). The music was calm and easy, and by midway through the meal we had a live singer going around the tables. He was awesome.   As for the food: absolutely amazing. I'm a vegetarian and was very happy with the selection. We started with the fried ricotta rivoli and had the soup (pasta fagioli, much like minestrone) or salad that came with our entrees. I then got the rigatoni trafficante (minus the prosciutto) and my friend got the shrimp alfredo. Everything was so delicious and clearly homemade. We would have gotten dessert but we were super stuffed.   Over all, it's a bit out of the way (relative to the Strip) but definitely worth it, both for the experience and for the food. I highly recommend Capo's!",

I cook and cook well enough to know the piece that was brought was old. The cheese on top was encrusted and charred so hard it was impossble it was a new piece. The sausage inside had a slime texture. I had two bites and left it to take home. For two days I have been sick with the worst stomach cramps and vomiting. Folks are visiting in October and made reservations long ago but unfortunately do not feel comfortable bringing them.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were looking for a great Italian restaurant for our anniversary.  We wanted somewhere off the Strip and decided on Capo's after hearing a good review from some friends that ate there.  I made reservations for 8pm and we arrived about 10-15 minutes before hand.  We did the whole gimmick thing of ringing the doorbell, telling the guy through the wall my name and reservation time to get in the secret door, and then started the waiting game.  The seemingly never-ending waiting game.  We stood for a while, while people in front of us were either escorted to their tables or left because they got tired of waiting.  We should've followed them, but we were really looking forward to eating there.  When the limited seating in the waiting area was free, we decided to sit down and continued to play the waiting game.  Twice, we were told our table was being cleaned and we would be seated shortly.  Those were lies.  We were finally seated around 8:40pm, all the way in the back corner of the \"movie room\" where Goodfellas was playing.  The server and bussers were quick to take our orders and get our drinks, but that's the only thing that was quick about it all.  We were back to playing the waiting game.  Throughout the night, we're watching as tables around us were sat, ordered, ate, and left.  All the while, we were still waiting for our food.  Multiple people, including who I could only assume was a manager, came to us and apologized throughout the ordeal, assuring us that our food would be coming up shortly.  Like before, they were all lies.  I should point out that none of these people were our server.  It was if she was purposely ignoring us.  It was a few minutes after 10pm when we finally got our food.  The food was not worth the wait at all.  It wasn't even worth half of the time we waited.  Their supposedly freshly made pasta was anything but, the meatballs tasted like they were store-bought, and their tomato sauce was extremely thin.  I'm not one to demand free things when service is bad, I just won't return and will make sure others hear of my bad experiences.  When I got the check and saw that they comped one of the meals, we were thinking that was their way of apologizing for the long wait.  That was until we drove away and noticed the sign that said 2 for 1 Tuesdays.  They comped the meal because that's what they do on Tuesday nights, not because they screwed up.  The one star is for the ambiance.  Had they owned up for their complete failures in customer service, they would've earned a second star.",

Lower or equal to olive garden.   As the night progressed, I tried to enjoy the night but the lounge singe decided to play music very loud destroying any romantic evening, and when we were done the lounge singer ran out to talk to my date again.  If this is a place your bringing a girl for the first time you should get there first or the employees will pick up your date.  Very unprofessional, expensive and not relaxing.   The only good thing about the place is it has a nice atmosphere.. Sometimes Yes I have been there 5+ times and never had really good food, and was amazed when my date went home with the lounge singer.      So if you want to overpay for low quality food and have the employees hitting on your date, This place is Perfect!!!  You will never see me there again though.....  dinner for 2, about $100.   price of loosing your date to an employee of the restaurant, priceless !!",

My hubby had the chicken parm sandwich I had the antipasti one and they were both awesome again everything was fresh and great quality!!  Too bad we didn't have room for dessert!",

It looks a little weird on the outside, and I was not optimistic but I couldn't have been more wrong. As soon as we got inside, the entire atmosphere shifted and we were standing in a beautiful restaurant with chandelers, high back booths, and Frank Sinatra surrounding the bar. The food was delicious, and the staff was so fun and helpful. We had a great time at Capo's and would absolutely return!",

I loved the cheese bread, the sauce for it was pretty good. Also, the lasagna has a mixture of cheese that go together wonderful, was not disappointed. Finally, the chocolate dipped cannolis are to DIE for! They're small, but very delicious. Had great service, our waiter was always on top of our refills and checking up on us. Friendly and good service! I'd definitely recommend stopping by here if you're hanging out in Vegas.",

We have always recommended this restaurant to all our friends coming to Vegas! We have always made our reservations for Tuesday night because it's 2 for 1...but we were very disappointed tonight. Apparently only locals are encouraged to come on Tuesdays because you have to be a local to get 2 for 1 on Tuesday. I really don't understand this concept and never heard of any restaurant having this policy. Our bill was $270 for 7 people and of course we were expecting it to be half of that. I spoke to the manager after we received the bill and she explained this was their new policy. She did deduct $20. I'm still very disappointed that a business wants to serve locals differently than anyone who walks through their doors.",

The service was good except our server put our food order in later for our main course so we waited over 30-40 mins between our salad and dinners. Unfortunately the food was terrible!! I ordered what was to be a prime ribeye which was over cooked and flat!!!! No flavor at all and my husband had pasta with meatballs and sausage. Typical Italian food. It was so dry and the meatball I can't even describe, just awful. I think it was to much breading?? The dessert was good. Espresso cold. Oh well, we still enjoyed ourselves, but will not return.",

First, as we pulled into the parking lot, there were lots of cop cars and an ambulance. Apparently someone tried breaking in the back with a butcher knife and attacked the cooks. Not a nice neighborhood. The mob and gangster theme can only go so far before the violence is real.  Next, we made a reservation here because we cancelled one at Herbs and Rye (amazing place) so we could take some friends to Capo's because it has a reputation of a cute fun place. Wrong. We ordered a round of drinks, ordered all of our food and an appetizer. Got the drinks, got the appetizer, then 15-20 minutes later without seeing our server with no refills on drinks and table cleared, we still hadn't gotten our salads. Two tables came and sat during our appetizer that now had their salads and meals. I spoke to the manager who blamed the kitchen issue, even though the server never came to check on us or refill drinks.  They brought us a \"round on the house\" and said our meals (now at almost an hour late), were next. That was a lie. Salads and second round of drinks were gone, a third table that came in after us received their entrees, and we were still sitting there. The manager came over and said he was comping the meal. Fine, we will wait for the entrees at this point, (one hour and 20 minutes).  Entrees arrived. Food was good, which is a shame that the service was so horrible. Risotto was great, all dishes were flavorful and good portion, but overpriced.  The bill arrived, and they just gave a small discount. Not comped. I told the server that the manager told us it was being comped. Manager came back over and said we misunderstood him, that \"comped\" was only a portion, not actually comped. So we ended up paying for that \"round of drinks on the house\" along with food that was clearly forgotten.  The thing this server and manager didn't know is that not only was our table of 4 all experienced restaurant workers, a manager, and a chef, but making the excuse of the \"hood system\" going down in the kitchen when 3 other tables got the entrees and were almost done by the time we got ours is just a disrespectful lie instead of just saying the server forgot to put our order in. At least honesty would be respectful. A full comp should have been the least they could have done with this debacle, but to lie and make excuses? Uncalled for.   Overpriced. Decent food. Music is WAY TOO LOUD. Horrible service. The gimmick isn't worth the time. Go someplace else.",

Once we were in and seater, I remembered why I hadn't been there in a while. The place is so dark you have to get the flashlight on your phone to not only read the menu, but see your food. They do have little lights attached to the menus but they aren't bright enough. So they know it's dark and?? Then there's the live entertainment. The music was good, it was very good, but it was SO loud we couldn't converse across the table. The food was ok, nothing special but ok. A bit pricey. The magician who went around was good but again, we had to shine a flashlight on him to see his tricks. It was a fun and unique evening but maybe it's better for the younger set? Our group was 50-62 and it was just too loud and too dark to enjoy. The secret entry is fun and the 3 tourists in our group of 5 found it unique but it didn't overcome the ultimate annoyance at spending the entire meal saying \"what? Huh? Say again? Louder?\" A frustrating evening.",

    "text": "I have been to Capo's several times over the last few years, dating back to when they were located on Tropicana.  Since they have moved from the Trop location to Sahara this restaurant has gone seriously down hill, each time I go worse than the visit before. I was greeted by the door guy, always somewhat gruff, but this time was very rude. Like why was I here, dinner?  Imagine that.   Then while we were enjoying a pre dinner drink at the bar, we requested a table.  The \"host\" which was the same guy from the door, seats us at a booth, one of several that were vacant.  Then he tells us that they are all reserved and he can give it to us if we make it \"worth his while\". So we tip him $5 as we walked all of 2 feet from the bar and figured he was just acting out the Chicago wise guy persona. He said, you can give me another one of those and stood there expecting more tip. Very odd indeed. It's not like he put much effort into it, and the booths remained empty throughout our dinner so they were not all reseved after all. The dinner was okay, service was decent, food was decent, but overall the restaurant had a dirty, dingy feel to it. The icing on the cake was the experience at the table next to us, where one of the guest was stung by a scorpion while he ate dinner.  He even took a picture of it! So, if there are scorpions, which to Capos' defense, are native to the SW part of town, then you know there are other bugs and they definitely are not proactively preventing them from being in their facility. Overall, I would saw last night's visit will definitely be the last. Not enough good to convince me it's worth spending money there.",

If you sat at the bar you could watch every meal prepared in the old school, open kitchen. Fun place with really good food! Now the entertainment was great too, with Frank S. being channeled through the gifted crooner. And the slight of hand magician with the amazing card tricks was a plus to the evening.",

I won't give it up here but it's worth at least getting a drink to experience that part.  Greeter was great.  Lounge singer was very 70s and campy, but liked him none the less.  Food is pretty below average in pretty much every way possible.  Bread they bring out is pretty bad and dries out within minutes of being at the table to the point it's inedible.  Salads were small, boring and WAY drowned in dressing.  Calamari is $15 or so, and is half the size of what they'd give you at Capitol Grille, and is pretty bland and mushy.  the pasta tasted as though it were cooked in rancid water.  the chef was nice enough to come out and bring my wife a personalized dish that he eats, and it tasted the same.  we smiled and pretended to enjoy it just to keep from looking like big complainers.  We literally don't complain usually, but her first dish was inedible.  My lasagna was decent, but nothing spectacular and the sauce was too sweet (but that's a matter of taste, so i digress.)  Desert: It was spectacular.  Try the tiramisu, it is the best I've ever had.  Canolis were great too.  Loved it.  Our server was new, and he told us as such, so he was pretty clueless overall, but very nice as well.  Bus boys were very attentive.  Service overall was above average but the food was just so mediocre I can't think of a reason to talk myself into visiting again.  If you go, get a drink, maybe an app, and head somewhere else for a good italian dinner.  For God's sake, Maggianos (a chain) kills this place at the same price point.  You're better of there or Macaroni Grill truthfully.",

I loved the atmosphere, whoever decorated did very well. I enjoyed the entrance in the back especially. I literally have no complaints.

My boyfriend had the Cioppino and said it was probably the best he has had anywhere, including SFO.   Absolutely nothing to complain about, the bill was reasonable, we had such a great dinner and will definitely be going back.

The outside needs a good paint job or power cleaning, the inside is awful. The food was awful, my husband wasn't cutting his steak , he was sawing it. I had lasagna and the sauce was way too sweet, like sugar. I could go on forever saying bad things about this place, but it's late and my head is still pounding from the bad experience of \"dining\" at Capos. Their gangster gimmick worked  because the place was packed,but I would guess it's a one time deal and most people don\"t go back.  I swear I never get headaches and my head is still pounding. Romantic date, special occasion, or wanting good food this is not the place to go. One more thing, my husband was still sawing his steak and I was still pushing my lasagna around pretending to eat it when the waiter asked us if we wanted dessert and coffee.  Who does that? I'm thinking it's a good idea to wait till people have finished eating before pushing dessert and coffee.",

Suddenly, the picture moves to reveal a square hole in the wall with a man standing on the other side and he asks you if you have a reservation.  He then opens the door for you and this is really cute, too, because a payphone on the wall suddenly swings open and you are invited into the restaurant.    From there, this service has more personality and character than Tony and Tina's wedding... we had such a magnificent time and the food was absolutely delicious. Service was amazing and everyone there was so friendly and so very, very Italian...    The walls are adorned with famous mafia figures, e.g., a huge poster of Al Capone.  The food was delicious... the stuffed Chicken Anastasia was the best thing I've ever tasted.  Don't be an idiot...  go to this restaurant when you are in Las Vegas.  You won't be sorry.  It's old school class meets crime drama with really good Italian food and steaks!  I'm coming back in two weeks!  I can't say enough about this restaurant's charm!  This place is an original... with great service!  There was a man singing live Sinatra type Songs and he was excellent, too.    Sincerely happy....

Although the food is well prepared it is extremely overpriced they have raised their prices tonight had the lasagna average lasagna prepared well not quite as good as it sounded on the menu as there was no apparent sausage but $25 for a piece of lasagna come on really. And then they ask you for your salad they don't tell you that if you order a Caesar salad it's an upcharge. $26 for chicken parmesan it's chicken parmesan people No frills No deals you need to raise your $$ to $$$$ on your website. Tonight very disappointed again the food was ok wait staff great the gangster at the door is fun. But that certainly doesn't excuse the extortion prices on the food.",

You pull up to a shady looking building (seriously don't be afraid) you walk through the first door where you find yourself in front of another Red door which says that the restaurant is shut down due to prohibition. ??? Um... then something fantastic happens after you ring the doorbell (go ahead try it!) The food was delicious and the appetizer was heavenly! I love the fact that they cater to vegetarians and they had special \"meatballs\" for us. It's really dark in there so make sure to use the light they provide you. Also, the SERVICE WAS UNLIKE ANY OTHER! Great job guys! The live music was also a great touch. I0/10 would recommend and go again in a heartbeat. Loved.",

Food is pricey but they usually have some kind of deal going on so keep an eye out for Groupon (usually a lunch deal), 5% cash back on Yelp and/or BOGO deal on Tuesdays for locals. Nice thing about that BOGO deal too is they will just take $40 off your total bill if you bring visitors with you ($20 for each local).   Favorite part is the entrance! I always feel cool busting out with the password. Ambiance inside definitely gives you that speakeasy feel- dim lighting, red tufted leather seats, The Godfather on one of the TVs, live music after 6pm (piano, Frank Sinatra singer). They have HH 3-6p Mon-Sat if you don't mind sitting at the bar.   If you get a salad, get the dressing on the side since they are pretty heavy handed. Cesar w/ chicken is also a fave for me. Try the Italian Duck Egg Drop Soup if you're feeling adventurous- a bit salty but hits the spot for me when there's word that there may be e.coli in my lettuce. They also substituted our lettuce w/ spring mix last night which was nice. Creme brulee is my fave dessert!  Usually opt for the picatta dishes. Pastas are all homemade, their meatballs are ginormous, so really hard to go wrong w/ that. Great service/ambiance, decent food and ongoing deals make this a 4 for me.",

Its dark and they had Sinatra and jazz playing. The seating is intimate but romantic wiith flickering candles on the tables. All the waiters wear all black with bow ties and suspenders. Our server was great! Very attentive and offered items that were off menu. He was also very funny.  Garden Salad - Fresh greens, and creamy garlic deessing. Flavorful. Calamari is a MUST try! Its super tender. It was complimented by the pepperoncinis and lemon. It had a great marinara for dipping. We had grilled chicken samdwhiches. I had the antipasto one that had italian cheeses and meat, on a grilled ciabatta bread. Really tasty besides the hot wilted lettuce.  My date enjoyed his crispy chicken paninni as well. We also had chianti that was pretty tasty. We will be back to try dinner menu. Great place for romantic date. Theres a piano there too, I m assuming they have live music, but not sure when.",

The restaurant is pretty dark when you walk in, and it will take a little bit for your eyes to adjust. Definitely, a cool speakeasy vibe with pictures of gangsters on the walls. All of the employees were very nice and checked in on our group from time to time. I started with the Garlic Cheese Bread and had Da Don's Lasagna for dinner. I was expecting/hoping the garlic cheese bread would be crispy and toasted, but instead, it was very soft, almost soggy. The sauce that it comes with was ok, and was much needed to add flavor to the bread, which didn't have much flavor by itself. My lasagna was large, but tough and rubbery. It seemed like the cheese within the layers was not heated enough, so it wasn't melted. Whenever I would try to bring my fork to my mouth, the lasagna would take my food back to the plate. The only way I can describe the sauce is that it was a little harsh tasting, or acidic for my taste. I only ate a quarter of it, before I gave up.   I really wanted to like Capo's, and was looking forward to my dinner. Everyone else at my table enjoyed their food, so maybe I'll come back and order something different and see if that helps. I'll make sure to update my review whenever that happens. I feel they deserve a second chance. Like I said, the atmosphere is cool, and the employees were very nice. The magician that visits the tables was great! His tricks were comparable to the magicians at The Magic Castle in Hollywood. I'll let everyone know after I give it another try.",

Although i would have preferred a slightly larger portion for dinner, the experience was very positive thanks to Erin's friendly service. Lunch however was a surprise, and even though I did expect the opposite since we ordered from their lunch special menu, the portions were actually very filling. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan sandwich which was loaded and delicious (although I suggest asking for a little less sauce or even on the side to avoid the sogginess on the bread of you let it sit more than a few minutes) What made the afternoon even better was the excellent service and super friendly attitude of both Josh our bus person and Angela our waitress. Nether of them had been there for long, but they acted as if they did with excellent knowledge of the food and friendly service which made our stay more enjoyable. Everything you expect from a True Italian restaurant, from the romantic atmosphere with dimmed chandeliers candles (make sure you bring your phone for use of the flashlight when reading the menu) and a live piano (at night), not to mention the consistent playing of old Frank Sinatra and mob movies on some screens on one side of the room. We were too full to try the deserts but we will definitely go again soon. It is definitely one of the hidden local spots. Oh, and did I mention they also have 2 for 1 Tuesdays in case you did not notice the sign on the front of the restaurant.",

I love their shrimp scampi and chicken Angelo. I've tried some of their specials as well and they're all wonderful. The servers are very attentive and knowledgable of their menu.  Great atmosphere to let loose, enjoy some good eats and drinks!",

I made a reservation through OpenTable for my brother's birthday and made a note of it because he loves the mafia theme and the singers from the era. Unfortunately we were seated by the bar without any view, were told we couldn't move because the other spaces were booked (though I did see empty booths throughout the entire time we were there), and no one wished him a happy birthday (not that they needed to).   The singer himself was great and I really wish we could have watched him perform. We won't be going back.",

To end the night we had the cannolis which come 2 in an order and are so creamy! Highly recommend coming here!!!!",

He said the kitchen was closing soon I told him we already had looked at the menu online and we knew what we wanted, the server was nice she took our order. My wife had the Angels with dirty faces without the pepperoni, I had the Chicken parmesan. When the food came it was great the Chicken was the best I have had, cooked perfectly my wife's dish was also delicious. I think the host was busting my chops because I didn't call ahead. I recommend this place you won't be disappointed. Great atmosphere with big red booths, mob pictures on the wall and Frank Sinatra music being performed by a man playing a piano. Next time in Las Vegas we will be back.",

Capo's is a definite hit! From the surprising entrance/greeting  to the almost listenable piano lounge singer (the food wasn't the only thing that was cheesy), the ambiance is a serious part of the experience. The service was overly friendly and helpful but the food was the real star. I had the lasagna which came with a salad and bread. Although a tad on the pricey side, it is a good sized portion and probably the best lasagna I've had since my friend John's super Italian mom made hers back in Ct in the 70s. I went with 3 good friends and they all had the same great experience. Found out they have a locals deal on Tues of 20% off. Will definitely go back again and spread the good word!",

The variety of flavors in this dish come together to form a beautiful symphony in your mouth. I wanted to not only scarf the entire thing down, but also lick the plate clean. The atmosphere is also awesome. There is a secret entrance to get in and the dining room has a vintage look and feel to it. I highly recommend this place if you're ever in Vegas. It's not on the strip, but well worth the drive to it! I definitely plan on going back on my next trip to Vegas.   *The lot has plenty of parking  **The service is friendly  ***If I could, I would give Capo's a 6-star rating!",

Before the cab picked us up from Bally's 3 of us split an edible that was the size of a mini tootsie roll. We all got into the car and started our drive away from the strip.  Now let me just warn you this place is NOT by the strip. Anyways we get there and the entrance was amazing, you don't even know you're in the right place! At least not till the mafia boss let's you in the back from the magic wall.   So we get seated in the Frank Sinatra booth and order apps and dinner. Our server was AMAZING, the food AMAZING, atmosphere AMAZING. It wasn't till right before the dessert came that the edible hit us like a southern grandma in church! We could not stop laughing and started losing all sense of reality and feeling in our legs. My friend and I had to use the restroom which is not easy when you can't tell your legs to move or get up. I some how made it to the bathroom. I lost my friend and come to find out she was outside throwing up like the exorcist all along a random alley. We got into an uber and made it safely to our hotels   Would I go back to Capo's? YES!  Am I ever trying edibles again? NOOOOOOOO",

We had high expectations because of all the positive comments but that was not the case.  1.  Drinks were perfect 2.  Order the meatball appetizer...these were the best part of the meal 3.  Nothing we ordered was paced!  You shouldn't ever be served the next course before you're done with the prior course 4.  We had to ask the busser for a bottle of wine because our waitress was AWOL 5.  Ordered dessert with the busser because the waitress was again AWOL 6.  When you are serving a good product you don't need to hide it in sauces  When the waitress was available she was great but after our meal arrived we were never checked on.    We wanted to LOVE this restaurant but will most likely visit for drinks and appetizers at the bar only.  The restaurant would be best as a place to meet up and drink but not as a dining destination.",

They have a dramatic entrance where you ring the doorbell and the guy opens up a small window to see who you are, then opens the door to let you in.  The place was very dim with lots of awesome decor from the mafia world. While casual dress is ok, I felt under-dressed wearing jeans as many were dressed a little bit more formal.  Then the tables that were empty were already reserved. So, my friends and I ended up dining at the bar. Oh boy! I was happy that we ended up at the bar! You can see all the live actions while they cook and prepare your meals. They have TVs at the bar and a live singer by the piano at the center of the restaurant (I came in at the right night). It's really awesome!   I ordered Tony Duck's soup and Spaghetti with Meatballs. The soup does not contain any duck. It has spinach and eggs with such a flavorful broth! I came here to try out their spaghetti with meatballs and it was delicious! The homemade meatball was bigger than my fist. It was moist and did not fall apart when slicing. The marinara was well flavored and good consistency. I prefer my pasta a little thicker though.   This is one of the great dining experience I would not hesitate to take my family and friends when visiting town. Capo's is definitely an added gem for Vegas! And the cute and friendly female bartenders added a nice touch!",

For our entrees we ordered the eggplant parmagiana and penne ala vodka. Both were just simply amazing. I substituted the spaghetti for pesto pasta which was also great. Overall this has been one of the best Italian places that my wife and I have been to across the US. It's such a great place and totally worth the trek off the strip. Not to mention the entire ambiance of the place rocks starting from he very cool way that they greet you at the entrance. Thank you Capos!   PS - be sure to check the address that uber suggests for this place as it is not current with their actual location. We learned this the hard way after going to their previous address suggested by Uber.",

You might gain eight pounds over the course of dinner, but don't worry about it -- worth it. I've never had a bad meal here. But make sure to experience one of their meatballs. Unrivaled meat heaven. You can order one on the side with any meal for $5 bones.   The staff are friendly and efficient. We sat at the bar and Sierra was our barkeep. She's awesome, knows her booze and very sweet.",

Parking is right outside so it's easy to get in and out. The big double doors facing west are the exit doors. Luckily there was a sign pointing us into the entrance that resembled a prison entrance. One inside the first entrance you ring the bell and a man's face pops through what was picture on the wall. After some small talk you're granted an entrance into a very dim lit restaurant. There are old mobster photos and  memorabilia on all of the walls. This place resembles and old speak easy that the mafia would have hung out in back in the day.  Live lobsters are there at the front for you to chose from. I will advise that if you have any large members in your group to specify a table over a booth when booking your reservation. There is both live and ambient music played during your meal. Sine it is so dark inside, they have attached small LED flashlights to every menu.    Full bar available or you can stick to their specialty drinks.  Seating is round booth (almost a full circle), bar area or traditional table and chairs. The do have space for large parties. We ordered the fried raviolis as an appetizer. They came out perfect! Slightly crunchy, cheesy and flavorful. Everyone ordered a sale over the soup, probably because it was over 100 degrees outside. The creamy garlic dressing was good. I'd recommend the house salad to anyone that is a big artichoke fan because there was a huge artichoke heart on top of my salad. The caesar salad was built from shredded Romain lettuce and the dressing was good there too.  I wanted spaghetti. I was torn between the meat sauce or meatball, so I got BOTH. The meat sauce and added ONE meatball. They are a half pound each.  I got to sample my mother in law's shrimp scampi and my guy's chicken Alfredo. Both were great. I was torn between all three so it worked out.  Luckily we saved room for dessert. I had the lava cake and he had the cheesecake. Both were great. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun off the strip Italian dinner. It think this would be a great spot to go after checking out the mob museum.",

They use a wine sauce  that's quite distinctive to the palette and nose but it's excellent. Husband had the spaghetti and meatball which was very good. We shared stuffed mushrooms for appetizers that were good and they too were in a wine sauce covered in delicious mozzarella cheese (excellent quality cheese!) The bread was great for dipping; crispy outside, soft inside. We were seated and within one minute  our server asked if we were ready to order. I told her we just sat down (which she knew!) I asked her to please give us time to look at the menu. She maybe walked two tables away and returned to asked if we wanted any appetizers (!!??!!) which I didn't get to look at yet either so she just decided on her own to read ALL OF THEM to us (!!??!!). She did the same thing with the dessert menu and that's the only reason this place gets 3 stars instead of 5. And we felt rushed to order our lunch entree too even though I told this girl we weren't ready. We were in the restaurant less than 5 minutes and she's trying to get appetizers and entree orders from us,  we didn't even get our drinks yet! There was no reason for her to be so pushy, it was lunchtime and there were only 6 other tables. If you are going to charge high prices  I expect top knotch service! Anyway, Food was good but for the prices they charge I should be able to sit and read their menu so I could get what I wanted not what she rambled off. The gentleman who let us in was super nice and informative and the bus boys were outstanding. Our server never checked on us about the appetizer, our meal or dessert and we had to track her down for our check. I guess she couldn't get anymore money out of us so she was done with us. But know this was just the way she operated as I watched our neighboring tables get superb attentive  service and maybe we'll return but certainly we will ask for a different server.",

I won't ruin the surprise of how they greet you, but let me just say that it sets the mood for the start of a very enjoyable evening. Having worked in Vegas once a month for work this past year, most of the dinners I've had have been very expensive and very poor quality. If you're in town and want to get off the Strip, that's where you'll find some of the better quality of Las Vegas. Capos has it all really. The food is wonderful.... I had the Chicken parm, salad and soup. The parm was great and had a light, but very flavorful, sweet marinara sauce. The wedding soup was one of the best I've had in years too. Too much dressing on the salad, but they make their own dressings, so I didn't care. They make it all from scratch.... 4-5 different pasta sauces are available, in addition to alfredo and vodka sauces. I was eating on a Wednesday night and they even had live music... a very easy listening Frank Sinatra-like. The service was great and the bartender and manager all take special interest in making sure that you are enjoying your meal and experience.  Get off the strip and go.... you'll be glad that you did.",

The pastas (al dente), veal picata (could cut with a fork), and shrimp fettuccini delivered the goods and Capo's remains on my list as one of the best restaurants off the strip in Las Vegas.  The restaurant's speakeasy theme and dark interior might take you a little off guard but its mafioso/brat pack vibe is easy to embrace, as is the live Sinatra style music.  Two for one entrees on Tuesdays just adds to the restaurant's likability.",

    "text": "Capo's is a place concerned with the experience. When you walk in the front door, you enter in a little vestibule area with no windows, no doorknobs (that work), and a camera in the corner. A little screen slides open and the guy asks you what you want, kinda like a speakeasy. When you enter the actual restaurant, it's very dark (so dark, in fact, that the menus have little flashlights attached to them) but decorated well.   I went there with a group of people. We were supposed to meet at 8:00, but not everyone showed up until about 8:45. To kill time, the few of us who were there decided to wait at the bar. After a few drinks, the bartender let us know that appetizers at the bar were half off. Sounded like a good deal, so I ordered the calamari, which was $14.99. The bill was non-transferable, so when enough of our party showed up to be seated, we asked to close out our tab. This was the first shady part:  Bartender: That'll be $10.82 Me: I thought the calamari was $14.99? Bartender: It is. Me: Didn't you tell us appetizers were half off? Bartender: Well the calamari is $10. Me: (Puzzled look) Bartender: Ok fine. Umm...just give me $8.  We sit down at the table and look over the menu. Everything is typical Italian, but I really got sticker shock when I saw the prices. Entree prices averaged around $24, which wouldn't be that crazy for a fine dining venue, but this really didn't strike me as such a place. Anyhow, the calamari had really taken the edge off, so my girlfriend and I decided to split an entree. We ordered the veal parmigiana, which was $28.99.   When we ordered our food, it was just after 9:00. When we got our food, it was just before 10:00. Granted there were 10 people in our group, but we were the only people in the place, literally. I don't know what they were doing, but I can't remember the last time my food took that long, even in crowded restaurants. I don't think I would have normally gotten so irritated, but I had gotten up at 3:30 for work that morning and had to wake up at 6:00 the next morning, so I had been antsy to get home and go to sleep.  When finally get our food, I ask for a separate check. I admit, I had forgotten to ask for it up front, but all the other restaurants I've been to in this town dodn't have problems splitting the check up post-meal, so I didn't think they would either.  Me: Excuse me, I need to leave soon. Could I pay for my meal now? Waitress: I'm sorry, but we can't split the bill after it's been created. Me: Oh, OK. Well could you please charge the amount of my meal to my card and apply it towards the bill? (I hold my credit card out) Waitress: We can only take two cards per bill, so only one other card can be used. Me: OK, well I know the rest of the people have cash, so I'm alright with this. Waitress: Fine. Let me figure out what your total is.  --about 5 minutes pass--  Waitress: You're total is $36.xx. Me: $36.xx?? What was the gratuity? I thought the veal was $28.99? Waitress: You two split the meal. There's a $4 split charge. Me: You didn't tell us about that when we ordered. Waitress: It's on the menu. Here, see? (She was right. The $4 split charge was indicated, but it was on the back page underneath the desserts. Since we hadn't gotten to desserts yet, we hadn't looked at the back page.) Me: OK, you're right, but why didn't you tell us about this when we ordered? Waitress: It's on the menu, so we don't tell people about it. Me: So when someone is asking for something and will be unknowingly charged extra, you don't think it's appropriate to let them know? Waitress: Nope. We're not allowed to tell people about it.  Me: Not allowed?? Waitress: Nope. The owner says we're not allowed to tell people about it. Me: That's really shady. Jen: Could we speak to the manager? Waitress: I am the manager.  Jen: Well then can we speak to whoever you report to? Waitress: He's not here. Jen: Well then how does your restaurant handle customer service? Waitress: Fine, I'll take the $4 off.  The waitress is gone for about 10 minutes doing who knows what. In the mean time, we're eating our veal, and it was mediocre at best. I would say the meat was maybe a couple millimeters thick with twice as much breading. The pasta sauce was lacking and nothing worth going back for. I gotta say, accounting for the cost and quality, you would get an exponentially better deal at Olive Garden.   She finally came back with our check, $31.30, and I paid. It seemed like everything worked out. However, after charging my card, she didn't stick around long enough for us to ask for a to-go container. We waited for about 10 minutes before my girlfriend decided to just go ask for one. She walked over to where the kitchen entrance/waitress station was, poked her head in, and said \"Excuse me.\" When the waitress saw her, she jumped around a corner. Literally. Our waitress ran away.   The service was shady and the food was mediocre. I would only recommend this place to someone for drinks.",

I went to lunch there recently with a group of friends.  The food was not very good.  Their bread is horrible!  It is dry and tasteless. Come on guys, with all the restaurants in Las Vegas who serve good bread, you can do better!  Several of us got food which was not very warm.  One person got a burnt (really burnt) meatball.  The tomato sauce was sickeningly sweet, as though it had a ton of sugar in it. I was most disappointed with my dish, Pasta Primavera. You would think it would be a medley of veggies, i.e. brocolli, squash, carrots, etc.  Nope! It was as if they took the pasta and threw in some of their bell pepper strips (tiny) from their sausage and peppers, and added tons of red onion. That was it and this meager amount of vegetable was swimming in oil.   The atmosphere was depressing with no windows and big chandeliers and dark walls.  If you are a tourist and want the \"speakeasy\" feeling of the mobs, go to The Plaza hotel downtown and go to Oscar's.  They have a cute backroom with much better atmosphere and much, much better food. In all fairness, the waiter we had was such a nice young man and kept trying to appease our group, and so I say \"don't shoot the messenger\", it wasn't his fault the manager can't get a good Italian chef or find a decent bread bakery.  I give Capo's a big, fat \"D\"!",

I have had it at plenty other places but Capo's was definitely the best.  The house salad that came with the dinner wasn't to bad also.  My Girlfriend had  Stuffed Chicken Anastatia she thought it was very good, I tried it \"excellent\".  They also had a singer for entertainment who covered old crooner hits.  I will definitely be back, sooner then later.",

    "text": "I was at this restaurant last night, and I have to say, for the second time, it didn't impress me.  And I will have to disagree with Ashley P.  We had a rather large party, dinner was supposed to be at 8:00PM. Unfortunately, some of the party arrived about 8:20, so we had been sitting for 1/2 and hour waiting for other half of party.  Meanwhile, I could not even get a glass of water.  No bread. No waitress.  Even after rest of party arrived, I sat there for about 25 minutes until I flagged down a waitress and asked if we could please start ordering since its almost 9:00 and I have to get up for work.  She looked surprised.  I'm not sure how long she thought we were going to sit there before ordering. My husband ordered lasagna, as did 2 others.  When it came, it was cold. Hot plate, cold food.  When my husband told the waitress, she picked it up and said \"well the plate is hot!\"  That is not how you treat a customer paying 23.00 for a piece of lasagna.  I'm sorry, but Maggianos service is 100% better, food is cheaper, and more of it, as well as it tastes better.  The penne that I had tasted like it was rinsed with dirty sink water.  Perhaps if it wasn't as pricey as it is, I would not be complaining as much.  But with those prices, the service should be way better. I will not go there again, nor advise anyone else to.",

I have been put in the unfortunate position of having to choose the restaurant for my firiends who may only be here for one night passing through.  Luckily for me Capo's is here!  I ALWAYS talk over with them if they want to eat a 'famous chef' dinner or an interesting fun and always delicious dinner, my favorite italian place.          When friends want the \"famous chef\" dinner the conversation continues and we choose from many and .... it doesn't always turn out so well, as all of us locals know.   But I always promise to myself the next time will be Capo's!      THEN - those who chose Capo's the first time ALWAYS rave rave rave about the experience and the food - ALWAYS!   And I always ask if they think they've made the right decision and they all tell me I should not have given them a choice.    I have yet to have that happen once with  the \"famous chef\" restaurant experience.    Wait, except for once, mom and dad visited and we had a Wolfgang Puck  Thanksgiving Day meal... mom loved it, but I get the feeling she likes to say Wolfgang Puck too.  Also no 'rave rave rave', just a nod saying this is better than I expected.  ;-)    Dad, the Italian, raved raved raved about Capo's, mom tells her friends \"oh you have to have her take you to this little secret Italian place with the tommy gun right up there on the wall\".  rofl",

The atmosphere is great makes you feel like a Italian mobster.   A small detail that I really liked is that the booths are high so when my fiancee and I were cozying up it didn't feel like everybody was watching us, nobody could see us and we couldn't see anybody else which was great.  The service was fantastic, not only efficient but friendly and the food was a solid 8/10.  The price is relatively reasonable.  I am going back in a few weeks for my bachelor party so lets see how they deal with a large rowdy group.!!!  But I recommend this place, you will not be dissapointed",

Exterior is cool, old school gangster limo out front with Mug Shots of famous mobsters, verry cool.  Entrance is very sketchy at first, you wonder if they are even open, and SURPRISE!! They are, you'll see what I mean.  The ambiance is great, real \"members only\" kind of feel. Photos and even chalk outlines on the floor to add to the gangster ambiance.  Live music by an authentic Chicago singer, songs by Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. He walks around and introduces himself and interacts with the audience and will even sing you Happy Birthday.   Food is fantastic, real authentice italian. I had the Lasagna while my girlfriend had the Ziti. Both delicious.   Prices are more than reasonable, prepare for 20-30 a plate. Well worth the experience! Will go there every time I visit Vegas",

Beware this is not a place to go with a big party, and beware they charge $100.00 for the private room and with big parties they don't allow you to sit anywhere else then the private room. They add on tips and the service sucks.. They don't allow splitting the checks. The power went out our server never came to check on us once during the outage, if it wasn't for the bus boy we never would have gotten our drinks refilled, and it took 2.5 hours to get our food.. we attempted to make reservations earlier that day but they don't open til 5pm we called at 450pm and we're able to make a reservation were told that they would waived the room fee, when we got there they hunted me down to question me about the fee. I wouldn't have minded paying the fee but there was no air conditioning and it was a little side room that was hot and stuffy and there was no view to enjoy the entertainment,  not what one expects to pay additional for. Our bill was over 400.00 and an additional tip of 85 was placed on the bill for a party of 10 adults and 4 children. After the 2.5 hour wait for dinner we couldn't wait to get out of there and I was to hot and exhausted from complaining about the stupid room fee to stay and complain about the awful service. I felt ripped of with the quailty and quanity of the food vs. The price. I thank them for at least taking the room fee off as it is not worth it and they had told me that they would waive the fee in the first place anyways. Thank you Capos for making our yearly Vegas family vacation dinner memorable in a bad way.  We won't be back, there is to many other places in Las Vegas that consistantly serve better food with better service then this place that will appreciate our business..",

    "text": "My wife and I were in Las Vegas for our 20th wedding anniversary and since we are both into \"Godfather-like\" things (movies, restaurants, etc) we wanted to check out Capo's ourselves.  We had first seen the Capo's restaurant when driving around Las Vegas on a previous trip - so we had it 'marked' (if you will) for our next visit.  Nothing short of amazing is what I would say.  The service was fantastic - we mentioned in casual conversation with our waiter that it was our 20th anniversary and before we knew it, we were being acknowledged by the bar singer.  He dedicated a song to my wife and I and it *just happened* to be her absolute favorite song -  Unforgettable by Nat King Cole.  Coincidence?  Maybe - but it really set the mood for the rest of the evening.  Either the owner or the chef came around to our tables during the evening to see how we liked our 'experience.'  He carried on a 5 minute conversation with us which was fantastic.  He did not seem hurried or the usual 'How was your dinner' and then on to the next table.  It was yet another very nice touch.  When we arrived, the place had about four or five other patrons in it.  We got there about 6:00PM on a Wednesday.  By the time we left (about 8:00 or so), the restaurant was about half-full.  Overall, the food was simply fantastic.  We've had lots of Italian food - including Italian food from places in Chicago, and both my wife and I agreed that this was the best we had had.  I highly suggest you try out Capo's if you're in the neighborhood.  It's worth the 10 minute drive from the strip.",

    "text": "My flight arrived at 7 p.m., and after a month-long sojourn in the Garden State, I was ready to reclaim Vegas.  Hubby picked me up at the airport and suggested Capo's.  He can't resist a deal, and Tuesdays it's 2 for 1.  In fact, right under the tall restaurant sign facing East, it proclaims in big letters, not to be missed by any local OR tourist, \"2 for 1 Tuesdays.\"  But more about that later.  We had a reservation and arrived a bit early, so we had to wait.  And wait some more.  So we got to hang out near the bar, with every seat filled by jocks drinking and shouting at various sports on the TVs.  No matter that the Vice Presidential debate was being aired, but not here.  I won't ding them for that, since most people wouldn't care.   At last we were seated, but our table was at one of the booths lining the bar, not in the main dining room.  That meant hearing the clanging pots from the kitchen right behind the bar, along with the aforementioned shouting jocks.  A very short while later, I noticed that the couple who walked in right in front of us, who did not have reservations, were seated immediately after us in a nice, quiet room right off the main dining room.  Normally, I would have insisted on another table, but I was exhausted from my sleepless flight.  I was still on East Coast time and it was late, even for me.  It took quite a while for the server to come over.  He apologized, but it was indicative of the service through the rest of the meal.  Not terrible, but not attentive enough, and certainly not as good as what we'd experienced here in the past.  Prices have really increased.  Yeah, Capo's is higher end, but it's not the Strip.  At least the Sangria I ordered was a good-sized glass and was very tasty.  But the copious amount of fruit turned out to be just lemon, lime and orange peel and pith.  And the dishes are served with salad or soup, and a choice of side, so it's not all that bad.  My husband had Chicken Lucchese, with mushroom risotto as his side dish.  His chicken was a very large portion covered with mozzarella, mushrooms, capers and broccoli.  My Chicken Picatta, on the other hand, was half that size.  I wasn't terribly hungry, so this time it was enough for me to still take home some of it, but the discrepancy in size was insane, especially since his had so much more stuff on it.  And was only priced at $1 more.  When it came time to pack up the leftovers, we were provided with boxes.  I usually like to box up my food myself.  But in this case, the plates were huge and heavy, and both had drippy sauce.  After I took care of mine, Herb put that plate on one corner of the table, along with our bread plates.  There was no room to maneuver, and the plates just sat there unremoved, while wait staff walked by several times and ignored how I was struggling.  This is not a hallmark of good service.  Now for the fun part - the check.  It was not 2 for 1.  It was 2 for 1 only \"if we had ordered the same dish.\"  Did it say that on the big sign outside?  Nay!  The bill was reduced by $20, not the amount it should have been.  Did it say \"$20 max\" on the big sign outside?  Again, nay.  And when we asked to see the manager, she, or someone claiming to be the manager, sat down and began a double-talk routine that would rival Abbott and Costello, telling us multiple times what I've just written above, repeating over and over that they weren't her's, but the owner's rules.  The biggest zinger, though, was when she said that the 2 for 1 was only for locals.  WTF?  Can you imagine being tourists on a budget schlepping by cab from the Strip because they heard about their Tuesday policy and finding out only at the end that they were SOL?  And did it say it on that big sign?  Third NAY.  Why would a tourist think this 2 for 1 didn't apply to them?  This has to be a blatant lie, and we don't like being lied to.  Obviously, the $4 difference in our check is small and will neither make nor break us.  But this kind of crap is not the way to run a business and alienate customers.  Is the food good?  Yeah.  But there are enough good Italian restaurants in this town with great atmosphere to ever have to put up with this.",

It's all part of the feel and experience of this restaurant. You walk in to a dimly lit dining room and bar and with Frank Sinatra music playing, felt like something in a movie. We got to sit in a corner booth and order our meal from a waiter with an Brooklyn Italian accent, just a very cool experience.   The reason we dropped in is because we got a Groupon for a prix fixe lunch for two which included a soda, salad and entree for $20. What an great deal. The Italian house salad was fresh and dressed with zesty Italian dressing and Parmesan. I ordered the carbonara with chicken as recommended by the waiter and the lady sitting in the booth next to us and it was not at all disappointing. Creamy sauce, perfectly cooked pasta, tender chicken, peas scattered within. Yum! I wasn't able to finish it because it was quite a large serving for lunch so the waiter brought me a large togo box for me. My fiance got the meatball sub and of course I had to try it. The meatballs were huge! They were tender and so flavorful. The bread was baked to perfection and the marinara sauce that came with it was super fresh, you could just taste all the fresh tomatoes in it.   This place is awesome. The experience is definitely one of a kind. If you haven't been, you have to at least check it out once. I've never been to a place like it. It's something you would expect in New York's Little Italy. What a fun place. I know I'll be back to bring my family when they visit. I know they'll get a kick out of it.",

    "text": "Great Restaurant Awsome  atmosphere and historical feel. This was my 2nd visit actually and this time I brought my Dad, who is the man responsible for my interest in 20th century italian american history and culture, so we're and we order our drinks and appetizers, my Dad gets a makers mark manhattan, my wife orders mango martini, and sodas for the boys and I, appetizers were stuffed mushroom caps, deep fried ravioli, brushetta, which were all delicious, next up was our first course, 4 Pasta Fagioli and 1 nico's ceasar salad, all for our main entrees, we ordered a bottle coppola red wine with our meal,my wife ordered the stuffed chicken anastasiashe enjoyed it, My Brother Ordered giant half pound Ma's meatballs, they were delicious as well my son ordered scarface shrimp scampy and loved it, My father ordered The evenings special, Lamb Chops cooked Medium Rare and I Ordered Primos Prime Steak Ribeye dinner cooked Medium. Here is where the only Issues to our dinner resided: My Boneless Ribeye came to me medium RARE instead of Medium and my mashed potatoes weren't the warmest when they arrived. I asked my Father how he liked dinner a day later and he said it was excellent but his Lamb Chops were a little over cooked(Medium) *BINGO*it wasn't a big deal, but Francisco or the Chef obviously got confused with who ordered Medium and Medium Rare. The devil is in the details! Im not the type to complain or send food back or do things that would irritate someone handling the food my family is planning to eat, but that was my only knock if any on a 5 star family dinner.service was pretty awsome with Francisco did a great job serving us. Just My Steak undercooked we'll be back though. Thanks",

We visited on a Sunday, so they had a wonderful Sinatra influenced singer, Dave De'Costa, covering a variety of classic songs. He was charming, amusing, and sounded just like the legend himself.   The creamy garlic salad was delicious. I could have easily consumed several more servings. The bread was warm and soft, with a flakey outer crust. I ordered the chicken carbonara and a vanilla cream soda. Everything was beyond satisfying and I look forward to my return.",

    "text": "This is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas! As a local, this is my go to spot to take my out of town guests who visit for an authentic Italian dinner. The atmosphere is sooooo cool. I love the speakeasy style (and the entrance is the best!), dim lighting, chandeliers and Mafia movies playing in the background. Although best for an adult date night or gathering, I also bring my kids here as well. One of my favorite things is the live singer there on Saturdays (and possibly other days of the week) who plays the piano and sings classics from that era (think Frank Sinatra, etc.) NOW...let's get to the food. The meatballs are out of this world. The shrimp scampi is amazing. You must try the mushroom risotto. My 9 year old son loves the fettuccine alfredo. My husband loves the chocolate dipped cannolis for dessert. Service is always on point. I recently threw a dinner birthday party there (of 14 people) for a friend. We had to change the number on the reservation a couple of times and they were very accommodating. They were super attentive and friendly with excellent service while handling that large of a group. They went out of their way to acknowledge the birthday girl and help make her night extra special. This place has been open since the 60's and I guarantee will be there for a long long time to come!!!",

These people give off a genuine 1940's gangster style experience. The people here have New York and Italian accents giving off an extra impression. The lighting here is very dim and the atmosphere is romantic and intimate. They have a Frank Sinatra style vocalist singing in the dining area every 10-15 minutes. The food however was not outstanding, though it was very good. The pasta here had an odd, metallic taste to it. Other than that, the chicken was very well done and the rest was very good. I will certainly be back but maybe for a more romantic occasion.",

We had reservations and when we arrived we got placed into a huge plush red side both in one of the corners. Note however it is dark in here almost \"I can't see\" kind of dark. So if you are sleepy maybe don't go cause you could fall asleep. While eatting we enjoyed the sing styles of a Frank Sinatra wanna be who was not at all bad. He was interacting with the diners even singing happy Birthday.  This place is pretty cool. We all had a good time and did not have trouble finding something to eat. I choose the Trafficante Rigatoni and a raspberry/ lemon martini thing. Both were very good. They use real oils and top notch ingredients. This is not your local Noodles and Co.   But with that said this place is on the pricey side. For my dish and my drink it put me back $25.00. Altogether for our party of 5 it put use back $137.00. So be prepared for that. When we finished we took a few pictures with the chalk drawings and the old school car outside.   Overall we had a great dinner and a good experience. I would go here again after saving up some babysitting money.",

I also think the lack of lighting hides the mediocrity of the food.   I ordered the chicken piccatta. It wasn't very tender or flavorful. The accompanying pasta and marinara sauce was the worst I've eaten in a long time. The salad which preceded the entree was swimming in Italian dressing and grated Parmesan cheese.   This place would have one star, but the service was attentive. The singer had a good voice and was pleasant to listen to during dinner. I tipped him $5 on my way out to show some appreciation for his talent.   Perhaps I didn't order the right dish, but I won't be back when I visit Las Vegas.",

The interior is ok but small. When we sat at our booth I thought it would be nice but that's when things fell apart. My daughter ordered a steak. $23.95! It was over cooked and breaded to much. She sent it back and told them about it. They still had the nerve to charge her $20.00 for a tiny salad and a little pasta. The rest of our party ordered their food and said it was just ok but the prices are way to high. The piano player was way in a corner and he kept singing to the wall instead of the crowd. There were two birthdays at our table and not one did one thing. The waitress was polite but not friendly. I wouldn't recommend this place at all.

    "text": "I must say I have been here before on several occasions and loved it ; however this time my expectations were so high only to leave me with mediocre thoughts of this visit.  First of all I am all about cleanliness , but I could not help but focus on my spotted , unpolished wine glass. My husband tried to get my attention off the topic , but it still was in the back of mind.     On the bright side with a few glasses of Riesling I was able to get over it . Upon our arrival I was surprised by the speakeasy entrance where I focused my eyes on the door I was sure was to secretly open, was actually on the opposite side. This greeting is a fun goodfellas type greeting in a secret corridor.  For starters my hubby and I both had a salad -his with house vinaigrette and I chose the bleu cheese. He was quite pleased but mine was drenched in the bleu cheese. Blech! I don't like my salad drowning in the dressing.  For dinner we both chose the Scarface shrimp scampi . On the plus side the shrimp was plump and generous in size.  The linguine was flavored with a small amount of scampi seasoning , tomatoes and garlic. The flavor was good but it was as if the chef dumped the linguine out and didn't toss the seasoning all the way through. I can eat some pasta but this was like a bland pile of linguine for $25 a plate , I expected more.  The ambiance was warm and relaxing. On Fridays they have a frank Sinatra crooner singing old blue eyes remakes. On my previous visits they would be playing old mobster movies but this time it was showing a basketball game.  The best thing to make up for my downer of dinner was the dessert! Chocolate cannoli's were Devine,with a rich, cinnamon chocolate coating= tasty! All in all , I still like this place . I will just order a different plate next time, I also may consider going to the Sahara location.? I love the idea and nostalgia Capo's brings so I am willing to give it another visit.  Try it for yourself , meanwhile I will forget about it !!!!!",

I've been here three times.  Once on a terrible date that was only salvageable by the happy experience of Capo's, and two other times with my family and friends.  My mother loved it - said it reminded her of old Vegas and her boyfriend, super North NJ kind of guy said it reminded him of old Jersey.  So it's a coast to coast venue?  Dunno, but super Italiano.  Has Godfather, Casino, and Goodfellas and all those flicks randomly on in the background with subtitles.  Heavy Italian/Mafia decor and themes everywhere.  Crystal chandeliers, red booths, cherry/mahogany wood everywhere.    Warning: VERY subdued lighting.  The menus have little flashlights on them but they don't always work.    I've had the tortelloni entree which had a very rich, delicious cheese in a generous portion, the salad with giant meatballs (which kinda worked in a way... a little odd but I can't complain a bit about it), and the chicken Parmesan, which was also portioned very well and quite good.    The waiters are all very slick and remind me of being home in NJ in the way that they speak.  Although my last waiter kind of blinked when I said I wanted hot coffee in the middle of summer at 3pm.

Oh and the singer was very charming too, he even dedicated a song to my boyfriend and I.  We can't wait to go back to Vegas to eat here again.",

However, the food is \"just okay\" and the prices are not about the quality of the food, but for maintaining the mobster atmosphere.  I would recommend this place for folks looking for a fun story to leave Vegas with.  If you are hungry and looking for a great meal to savor, this is NOT the place for you.  On our last visit the server was very nice, but the bar staff that was a different story.  I am not sure if I will come back to Capo's again, because I have had my fill of Vegas stories. If you are looking for an experience you won't forget this may be the place.  You wont forget how rude the bar staff can be.  Also, you wont forget how mediocre the food was and the price you paid for it!",

    "text": "Had dinner here last night for my fathers birthday and to put it lightly...we weren't happy. The back of their menu even says to state any complaint before you leave and asks you not to be a \"Jimmy The Weasel\". Red flag much?  For starters the food was nothing spectacular and extremely overpriced. I had the \"Sawed Off\" sausage and peppers which was $22! C'mon now. The dish was nearly all pasta and peppers with very little sausage. My dad had the extremely small portioned \"Gotti\" chicken. My wife had the fettuccine alfredo and actually left the restaurant saying she was still hungry. Don't get me wrong, the food was okay...not spectacular, but okay.  Now I'm not one to complain about a restaurant especially when the food is okay. My family and I enjoy trying new places and you're not always going to have a great experience. However, Capo's had me ready to refuse paying the bill. We used a $25 for $50 Groupon last night and Capo's works the system to where the Groupon is useless. We had 4 adults and my 4 year old son (who shared a plate). With the Groupon applied our bill was $77.77 ($127.77 without). However, the waitress took it upon herself to add $25.55 for gratuity putting the bill back up to $103.32. With the price of my Groupon, the bill was actually $0.55 higher than it would have been without a tip and to be honest, the service we received didn't deserve anywhere near a $25 tip. Once they took the credit card, the waitress even went as far as writing the tip amount on the credit card slip herself!!! Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that's illegal...  Now I realize many Groupon's have fine print stating there will be an added gratuity or something but not in Capo's Groupon. Be warned, this place has other reviews about the business scamming customers and now I see why. They make the Groupon useless by adding their own tip at their chosen amount. I will never return to this place and will contact Groupon in attempt to have these theives removed from their site. Now I just have to hope they didn't steal my credit card info!",

I won't spoil it, but its pretty cool and a nice touch to enter the place.  Once you enter, it is dimly lit and feels almost like a mob bar.  The host was wearing a nice Italian looking suit and the ambiance and decor of the restaurant screams Little Italy, even though it has a tattoo parlor and a check cashing place right next door.  Once we were seated, the waitress came over and offered us drinks and told us about the specials which were described excellently.  She left and a moment later an assistant had bread and our drinks.  We ordered a few moments later and the service never stopped being superb.  The food came out and it was excellent.  I had the ribeye with blue cheese crumb crust and spaghetti on the side with a caesar salad.  Very delicious.  We stayed in the restaurant for 2 hours but never felt rushed or pressured to leave.  The live music that was playing in the background I didn't even realize it was live until I caught a glimpse of the singer.  Overall, I would definitely recommend it.  Whether its for a romantic date or just dinner with a good friend, the place works for either occasion.",

    "text": "First off, the ambiance and building are fantastic.  We got lost and missed our reservation and they were super helpful getting us another one the next night.  We were excited when we got there because it was a fantastic set up (although in a weird area for tourists).  They have a beautiful piano but no one played it.  Instead there was a man singing to a karaoke machine with Sinatra CD's.  There was a magician going table to table but he did not visit our table.   However, the food is mediocre at best.  The fried ravioli was obviously frozen then dropped in a fryer.  It was mushy and tasteless.  The salads were fine.  Romaine lettuce seemed fresh and dressing was fine.  It tasted over seasoned, but we could not identify the spice over used.  Basil???   I ordered the fetticcine  Alfredo with grilled chicken and it was awful.  The chicken was NOT grilled.  I'm pretty sure it was frozen, precooked chicken chunks.  The sauce was awful and did not taste fresh.  Husband had the lasagna and said it was not good.  He ate a little then said, \"It's not even worth finishing\".  Everything was over seasoned as if they use bottled sauce and just add seasoning to make it taste \"better.\"  We did not bother with dessert.  So disappointing because it was NOT cheap.  The theme is really neat that's it.  Not fresh, not good, not tasty.",

The entrance is this little door and you walk in and there's a doorbell to push. A little window slides open and a guy asks for your name, like a mob restaurant, and then a secret door opens! SO COOL!  It is really dark inside and the menus even have little flashlights to help you see.  We ordered the stuffed ravioli with their homemade sauce.

I live in Vegas 4 days a week and So Cal 3 days a week, having restaurants in both states allows me to try a lot of joints.   Capo's by far is one of my favorites and is to mostly locals. Giada's (review to come soon) is another favorite but these two couldn't be more different but yet in my top 2 Italian eatery to visit.  I'm a chef and I used to be involved in Italian restaurants but now we have open different concepts.   Tonight we got the meatball and peppers app along with Cheese ravioli and chicken piccata. Everything was awesome, we usually sit at the bar which faces the line (kitchen) and can watch all the meals get produced and it's like a Ballet the way these guys work.  This place always seems to have a wait but being Italian and a chef and restaurant owner I think they always find a little spot for me, being a local for 20 years doesn't hurt either!  This is a must visit for ALL and come on a empty stomach because they will need the room.  The only thing I see that could piss people off and I wish I had enough balls to do it at my places is a \"split charge\" of $10, so if your going to try and be cheap and share a entire it's going to cost you! Bravo for sticking up for your servers and keeping the average per head close to $20! If you dint want to spend mo eat then don't go out to eat!",

    "text": "So we had reservations for Friday night and it was fairly easy to get them - we merely called the day before around 4pm.  We were greeted with someone sliding the door in a small open space that was close to eye level - this was a nifty surprise that made it seem top secret.  Despite having reservations, I think the place forgot about us...We were seated at the bar for 30 minutes and had to request attention.  They then seated us in a separate room, away from all the live music though...So after ordering a second round of drinks there (first at the bar), we asked to be relocated again.  I think we just caught them at a bad moment, but they were quick to make amends by providing us another free bread basket.  The meatball here is to die for - all the bread crumbs it entailed made it so tender.  The tomato sauce is rich, indulgent, and tart. We dipped 2 baskets worth of their hearty, crusty bread with their sauce and were so stuffed just sharing this.  Just as an FYI, the white chocolate martini is extremely sweet - I have the worst sweet tooth but even this was a bit overbearing.  Other than that, the other 3 drinks we had were safe bets and well made so.  Loved that the place kept the integrity of an old school feel.  It is a very dimly lit place with live music.  My date and I were very impressed.  Note that it is an older crowd.  My date and I are in our mid 20's, everyone else present was probably 40-60+",

    "text": "You drive past this joint on Sahara and wonder, \"What the heck is a 'Capo's'? and \"What is that all about?\" You might decide one day to be intrepid enough to go inside the unassuming little brick house, armed with the password you've been told is the entry requirement, and wait nervously in a foyer reminiscent of a speakeasy from the 1920's.  You almost expect an uniformed officer to come up behind you and ask for your ID, or why you are there.  Then, all of a sudden, a Judas hole slides open, and a gruff voice demands the reason for your presence.  You remember your parole (\"Joey sent me\") and pass through to one of the darkest rooms you have ever encountered, even in all of Las Vegas, every single casino included.  Not a single window is uncovered in the medium sized dining room, which is more upscale piano bar/dive than restaurant. Resplendent overhanging chandeliers above the table booths provide the only light in the room other than your guide's penlight.   You are seated at a semi-circular booth with blood red vinyl coverings.  Your guide assists you to get inside.  You hear the piano man sing and play, interspersed with canned music.  He wears a fancy suit with a shirt opened up to his navel, but he is good.  It is surreal.    You strain to read the menu, then realize it comes with its own penlight, which you turn on, and make out a traditional Italian, \"Goodfellas\" cuisine.  Pasta, steaks, soups, and salads.  But also, surprisingly, whole lobster, which you choose.  You decline to pick out the little fella yourself, as invited by the server--leaving the dirty work to your waitress, who is sweet and whose hair almost ascends up to the bottom of the chandelier.  The egg drop soup is briny and filled with hearty vegetables, a great appetite opener.  Salad is rich with a house-made Italian vinaigrette. Your cheese bread appetizer is warm, robust, and melts in your mouth. Your steak is tender, juicy, and unstinting.  The lobster you selected is outta sight.  Mammoth creature served to you on an enormous platter undergirded with buttery zucchini, broccolini, and squash.  The lobster has been plated and scored perfectly.  Your shrimp cocktail hearkens back to the good 'ol days, when Vegas was run by guys who are now immortalized in downtown's Mob Museum.  You hear the crooner ask the ladies for a suggestion, and you call out one.  You order dessert, your eyes now adjusted to the darkness, and enjoy the flavorful confections brought to your table, including a delicately flavored tiramisu and a cappuccino Starbucks wishes they could pull off.  You notice there is an extensive wine and cocktail list (but it is during the day and you pass).    You notice that whenever you finish a dish, it is quickly taken away, and your glass never remains less than full for more than a few moments.  You notice every person helps out who even walks by your table, and you get the feeling that you are a \"VIP.\"  Maybe these people are mistaking you for someone else? No, that's just the way that they are with their patrons.  After all, \"Joey sent 'ya.\" You wonder what the heck kind of place is this, with black tape and Victorian mirrors covering the windows.  You could be there at 3am or 3pm and not know the difference.  Nor feel it.  It is not even Las Vegas anymore.  It is Chicago.  Or New Jersey.  Or gritty Philly.  Or what have you.  You leave, slip the singer a fiver who acknowledges it with more than expected appreciation, and notice the chalk outline of a body in the lobby.  Being initiated at Joe's, this type of thing no longer bothers you, and you regard it with amusement, not horror.  Hitting the sunlight in the outside world, you are temporarily blinded and stumble towards your vehicle with a full belly, and fond memories of a place just beyond your imagination.  Tip: Be sure to Check in on Yelp and get $10 off $75 (above which you most certainly will spend).",

I ordered eggplant Parmesan and my friend ordered chicken Anastasia... chicken was dry and not tender at all. Eggplant Parmesan was very tasty. We ordered tiramisu for dessert to share ... very good.

I stood in the lobby way too long.  Walking in you can't see anything since they have the lights super low where you need a flashlight to see the menu.    Food was amazing! Service was amazing no complaints. I ate the Anastasia Chicken, bomb! I had a salad which was good and the mushroom risotto which was good..",

    "text": "So we came to Capo's in the same weekend that we visited several \"upscale\" restaurants [some owned by celebrity chefs] and this was the best restaurant we visited all weekend.  The service was great starting from the \"greeting\". Our waitress Sara was awesome and interacted with our group very well. She certainly added to the fun. After starting with a couple of pitchers of Sangria we ordered some appetizers and onto dinner.   My wife chose to go with the Chi Town shrimp scampi appetizer for her dinner which was really good. I had the spaghetti and vegetarian meatless meatball. Yes, that is right, a meatless meatball. I have had some better faux meats around but still the marinera sauce really takes over the taste and I really enjoyed this meal.  My brother had the lobster risotto and I had to taste it but I am glad I did; may be the most delicious thing I have ever tasted. At over $100 its something you only try on your birthday weekend but man it was good.  Everything about this place made you want to come back. I have to go get a fake NV license because I read that Tue is local 2:1 specials. Hope to come back soon.",

The guy singing, then our waiter Armondo (who was AWESOME - love him) joined in as well singing to our table. Completely blown away. Oh, the food?  Amazing. I am a lasagna fan, and this did not disappoint. Everything was so good from Sausage & peppers, to meatballs (spicy!) to salads and finally main course. Veal, gluten free, steak, and my lasagna were all amazing. 5 stars!  Go and enjoy, I'd recommend reservations. And give Armondo a raise!",

So I don't want to just spoil it for you but they have a peculiar way of taking reservations and receiving you when you arrive, it made us feel like we were back to the old days when Mafia was all over the place and things had a hint of suspense and mystery.  The place is absolutely gorgeous! The decoration, the chandeliers and pictures on the walls just take you right back to a different era. We were seated immediately and they had us in the red booth by the mirrors, facing the whole place, excellent!  Customer service wise they're also amazing, our server lady was very cordial and attentive, she took our orders and made sure to help me find a non alcoholic drink (I'm pregnant) so I wouldn't feel so left out as everybody with me was drinking. She suggested me a fruit punch that was delicious! Food came out pretty quick, we had appetizers, a soup/salad and our main meal. I must say that everything, absolutely everything, smelled and tasted fantastic! Me and my girl had dessert as well, she had the cannoli while I had a tiramisu, yes it was tasty and fresh. We ended up bringing some of the food home as their meals are good sized. Last but not least, I'd like to go back to the atmosphere. This place was beyond what I expected, the lightning and music were so relaxing and intriguing. They had a singer who made me cry happy tears, oh my God! That man had such a soft voice and he actually walked up to our table to sing us a song and I couldn't hold my tears, he was very friendly and interactive with us. This easily became my favorite restaurant and I'm already planning on making reservations for their Sinatra brunch on Sunday!",

    "text": "This was one of the highlights to our trip to Vegas. Loved the ambiance, service was superb, live piano music was wonderful, and the food was easily the best Italian food I've enjoyed. And the portions are huge. We were staying on the strip and took a cab to the restaurant. When it was time to go, we asked our waiter about calling us a cab, he told us it would be hard to get a cab off the strip that far and could be a 45 minute wait. He came back 5 minutes later and had arranged a ride with 'a driver' that was at the bar. Turns out the driver is normally Capo's Sinatra singer but was not working due to laryngitis. They were awesome! Love Capo's.",

From the secret entrance to the warm welcome, you feel like you are part of this loving MOB family. Lol The food was AMAZING and worth the price. It is a little pricey, maybe not something you can do every night, but I promise when you do go you will not be disappointed with the flavor blasts in your mouth. The flavors are reminiscent of my vacation in Italy...LOVED IT!!",

    "text": "Visiting my best friend in Vegas & we decided to check this place out after hearing great things. Here is our experience.... We walk into a small foyer with locked doors and a doorbell for entrance, this is at 6 PM on Wednesday. A small wizard of oz \"face door\" opens with a guy asking is we have reservations, we tell him no, he offers us to come in if we agree to sit at the bar, we were ok with that. I'm thinking \"are they going for an Italian Mafia impression? Cuz, it's working!!\" We sit at a nice big bar, in a place that was at least 90% empty --- REALLY? And a reservation is necessary for a table or booth?   Bartender takes our drink orders and delivers the menus. The place is so dark, the menus have a keychain flashlight attached to them. The Caesar salad was limp, greasy and pretty flavorless. The pasta e figioli soup had a nice flavor, but the puree texture was kinda weird, I prefer a broth and chunky texture.   My friend ordered the \"sleeps with fish\" specialty pasta dish, and she said it was VERY good. I ordered the vodka specialty pasta with blackened chicken, the pasta \"pink\" sauce was really flavorful and I really enjoyed the sun-dried tomatoes. The blackened chicken was extremely salty. The bread served with the meal was really good.  The bartender/waitress asked us to give her our honest impression of the things we had, so we told her.... Before long, the manager came over and apologized and offered to remove the extra charges for the blackened chicken and the Caesar salad \"upgrades\", which was very nice of him. (I think that was the same \"face\" that opened the little wizard of oz door when we got there).  The bill arrives and my friend pays with her credit card. There isn't a keychain flashlight on the bill, and with the lights so low, my friend misread the total as being $20 more than it actually was (we noticed her copy later in the evening in \"light\").... I am quite curious to see if they ran her card for the actual tip amount she posted or the wrong total and take the $40+ tip, instead of the $20+ tip that was intended.   I may end up adjusting my rating accordingly when I find out if they are honest or not.",

We enjoyed the singer doing Sinatra songs while walking aound the room. The food is very good with the portions being enough to fill you up. Consequently we did not have room for dessert. The chicken picata with garlic mash was excellent as well as the veal picata with mushroom risotto. The only downside to the food was the crusty bread was dried out on the inside. The night of our visit the service could have been better. First our server did not offer us water. She seemed to disappear for a while and we had a hard time flagging down another person to help us. The restaurant was full. There was a group of about 20 people at one table. They could have had more servers. Resolving these items will add other star.",

    "text": "Let me praise this place first and foremost for it's customer service. The one thing I'm always impressed by is when you have a large group of people, and they provide excellent customer service. We had a group of 11 people and only 1 waitress. She was awesome and amazingly attentive the entire time.   I was very nervous because my boyfriend's grandparents are obsessed with Italian. I never recommend places that I haven't been to, but all of my friends that I trust had recommended it to me. I'm so glad I made the choice! Everyone loved everything they got, and the best in my opinion was the Chicken Marsala. Most of us passed around our dishes to try everything out, and there wasn't one thing I didn't like. I do love Italian, and I have been very picky on the places that I like. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants. I just feel they're all the same and generally the same \"OK\" type of quality of food. There are a few exceptions, but I usually shy away from these places.   I see people on here complaining about the prices. I feel that the prices are very reasonable, and here is why -  The dinners come with bread, soup or salad.  They give you large portions (even though I typically appreciate smaller portions so I don't over eat.) They have live entertainment, I'm sure it's mostly in the evenings.  The ambiance and the experience. It's cute and \"mob\" style.  The service. I always pay attention to the service and the service around me, and everyone seemed very content. The singer and the manager even thanked us for coming in and dining with them.   People need to take in account for everything, not just the prices, especially if it's worth the prices and it's good food.   I know it may not be consistent across the board for everyone, but I had an awesome experience. Go to their website, look at their menu before you go. It's definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys something different than the norm.",

The service our first time around was fantastic and attentive; but last time we went, it was non-existent.   Being from NYC, the Italian cuisine is not the best I've had, but for being in Vegas, I suppose it's pretty good. Honestly the best part of the entire establishment is how they're set up: the entry is entertaining and the decor is also a lot of fun. It's a great place to take your friends from out of town, because it is in some ways a touristy gimmick.   Here's a tip: Go on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> for a gift certificate and save $$ on your check.

My favorite meal is the chicken francaise, with the creamy garlic salad, and garlic mash potatoes. You must have the espresso martini for desert as well! The thing that keeps me coming back with new groups of friends and family is the amazing magician named \"V\". His jokes are hilarious, his magic is phenomenal and it's the perfect entertainment to spark up a dull dinner with the inlaws! Make sure to bring some cash to show your appreciation for this skilled act! The live music is great too.",

We went before 5pm on a Monday and it was super mellow.  We ate so much that unfortunately, had no room for dessert or ordered cocktails so cannot comment on that.  I do highly recommend this place and not just for the fad.  It's very unique and worth trying it out for yourself.",

    "text": "Worried that it would be too theme parky or kitschy....Well it IS kitschy but it is the right kind of kitschy.  The place is not very big with a 6 or 8 seat bar, a small area to wait for a table, a main dinning room with 8 booths or so and about 10 dining tables.  There is a small dance floor but it is more for the singer than for dancing.  There is a second room for large groups or overflow seating but it was not air conditioned the night we came.....and I can not imagine trying to dine in there with temps about 15 degrees higher than the restaurant.  My only real complaint is that the temp in the dining room was about 76 degrees and it felt a little stuffy and warm.  1.  Make a reservation. 2.  Ask for a booth 3.  Be willing to play along 4.  Have a martini or two 5.  The \"Sinatra\" singer is actually really good and he smelled nice too. 6.  Use your cell phone flashlight instead of the mini flash lights they give you to read the menu. 7.  A candelabra on your cell phone can be a nice touch on your table 8.  Go for it.  Dress like a gangster, grab your favorite dame, and don't forget your hat.   The food was good.  But if you come back it will be for the experience and probably not the calamari.",

Capo's food is \"authtic Italian\", not like the Olive Garden variety. The mob/speakeasy theme makes eating there more of an experience and is really quite fun! The decor is very era appropriate. It is quite dark inside, but they provide small lights for reading the menu.  I mentioned to the manager that we were celebrating a 30th wedding anniversary. I thought maybe he would have his wait staff bring them out a piece of cake with a candle or something in recognition as other restaurants often do. He did nothing at all. That is really the only fault I have to find with my experience at Capo's.  BTW...the meatball appetizer is fantastic...a must try when you go!",

An extra-special *Thank You* to Janeen for working with me while I was a nervous fiance-to-be -- you were always courteous and patient and you totally sold the cover story -- thank you!).

Italian food is not that difficult, yet so many places mess it up, and this place tops that list! $20 for a piece of lasagna that tasted like mush and was the size of cigarette pack. Hot ceasar salad with rock hard croutons and stale bread. The ambiance was horrible. I went with a party of six and they stuck us in a makeshift table in the isle next to the bar where everyone walking in or to the bathroom had to bump into us. The lighting is so bad that they have to put small lights on the menus. Some Sinatra wannabe singing so loud that I couldn't hear the people at my own table. The only bright spot was a well made Cherry Coke and a nice waitress who knew what a joke her work environment is. If you like the stereo typical wiseguy theme Italian restaurant, then this place is for you, right down to the secret entrance. You'll get a better bang for your buck at Fazolis so save yourself the heartache and skip this place, I wish I had...",

With a capitol H. forgot our appetizer, couldnt get a 2nd drink after waiting 20 min for the first one and had an attitude when i said i had capo gift cards (which i had ironically gotten cause my service sucked so bad the time before).

    "text": "Thanks fellow yelpers!  I wouldn't have found this restaurant without you!  This place is quite an experience... Initially it felt like I was at Disneyland on the haunted house ride.  We opened the door and entered into a small room with wall to wall dark wood.  We stood there for a few minutes and then a small window opened behind us.  I was so surprised and caught off guard, I let out a loud yelp.  The side door opened, which lead us into a dark restaurant.  The place was decorated with old italian mafia type accessories.  Most of the props looked really old and it further reinforced the feeling of being at Disneyland.   We were seated on the stage area and had a good view of the live singer, who sang Dean Martin hits most of the night and it sounded really good.    The restaurant was so dark, the menus had small flashlights attached to them.   We had the egg drop soup, appetizer pizza, scallops and arrabiata pasta.  Everything was very good.  I highly recommend this restaurant.    I gave it one less star because of the aged mafia props!",

    "text": "Relying on yelp reviews I made an excellent choice for tonight's dinner.  First time in my life I literally cleaned up plates in Italian restaurant :) because a) I was really hungry; b) portions were just right to allow for dessert in the end.  We started (as recommended) with Stuffed Mushrooms - they were great and even though my g/f doesn't like olives in any form she ate a half of the portion :) I had lasagna - it was great and portion was not huge which is a plus because I wanted to leave room for dessert. I also had bean and pasta soup with it - excellent. My g/f ordered fetuchini alfredo with shrimp - she didn't manage to finish the pasta but she got all the shrimp out of it for sure - it was big and (what's that fancy word ..) - succulent. She also liked Italian egg drop soup.  Then we had chocolate cake with side of ice cream - plate was clean :) And finally when we were ready to go the singer came to our table and sung a serenade for my girlfriend.   Bottom line: + interior is cool + food's good + singer is great  I definitely recommend this place to anyone.",

My husband had the bacon wrapped filet and said it was so good, he did not want the flavor to leave his mouth!  Coming from 2 serious Sicilians.... Capo's is the BEST and my new favorite Italian spot.  However, I did try a bite of the ravioli and I was not impressed but everything else was nothing less than amazing.",

    "text": "The front door gimmick is certainly worth talking about for the first few minutes of your meal.     Upon entering the restaurant you are greeted by a classic Italian Mob looking joint complete with the cheesy crooner singing tableside.  The setting and ambiance are perfect.  As for the meal,   The wine list is a very lacking, as it was mostly new world wines with only fifteen or so selections.  We settled on a bottle of Ruffino Gold Label ($60), all though if they had any quality Italian wines we would have been happy to spend a bit more.  On the high end side of things they only had Silver Oak and Opus One, which were priced far below normal Vegas mark-ups ($110 & $250).  I got there a bit after my friends who had already ordered appetizers.  When the apps came, they brought out the bruschetta with no cheese instead of no pancetta as my friends had claimed to order it.  My friends can be space cadets so this could have been their fault.  Regardless of who's fault it was, the waitress was very nice and brought a new one and allowed us to keep the improperly made one on the table.  I ordered the Pasta Fagioli soup which was excellent, but served luke warm, and then the Veal Piccata which was also very good, all though I thought it was a bit of a small portion.  Everybody else at the table really enjoyed their meals, and it was a pleasant experience with Dean Martin and Frankie Blue Eyes being sung five feet away from us.  Our server was very nice and attentive even though she had quite a few tables running at once.  I will come back to Capos when I am in the mood for a fun evening away from the strip.  The food is good, but not great.  But considering that it's not that expensive, and they have to keep a guy employed just to scare the crap out of you at the front door, I'll give them a pass.  They get five stars because I did enjoy the evening very much, and I don't want to get whacked next time I come in if I only gave it four.",

We started dinner with 2 apps - cheesy garlic bread and mushroom caps,  The mushroom caps were the BEST!!  I decided to try the nightly special - panko chicken breast stuffed - sitting in a bed of spinach and roasted potatoes!  So GOOD!  I really wanted to try some desert - but I was too full!  If you're in the mood to try Capo's - get the mushroom caps to start for sure!  Oh, I loved watching Casino on the TV in the dining room and listening to the singer at the piano...a fun night for sure!!",

The food you can tell is very low quality since we frequented them a few years ago. The bruschetta tasted like band aids and the salad dressings had no flavor! Just oily wilted lettuce. The chicken parm was just ok. Bland sauce and over fried low quality chicken. The chicken fettucini was good, except for the frozen grilled chicken, that looked and tasted like Tyson frozen chicken with the fake grill marks. The best part of the meal was the chocolate covered cannoli s, because the lava cake was terrible and they were out of ice cream. We definitely won't ever be returning. The place was dead for a Sunday night, now we know why.",

I wanted the ravioli, but they were out, so I had their special - swordfish.  The best swordfish I've ever had along with the best risotto I've ever had.  Red sangria packed a delicious punch, too.

    "text": "I will bypass the ambiance talk since other yelpers have definitely covered all the bases from the cool entrance, to the mobster pictures on the wall, the gangster movies on in the background, and the Frank Sinatra-like singer.  My husband and I had a great time at Capo's.  We made reservations (which I highly recommend) for 7 p.m. on a Friday night.  We got there a 1/2 hour early not knowing how long the drive would take and am I glad we made reservations - the place was packed this night!  No biggie - we sat at the bar and waited.  We hit it just right because happy hour was from 5-7 p.m. and I had the best martini of my life for half off!  The Domitini (martini) was amazing and my husband said the gin and tonic was great too.  We also ordered the stuffed mushrooms at the happy hour rate and we were really pleased.  The host waited for us to finish our drinks and appetizer before coming over to seat us.  It was nice not to be rushed through or have to juggle drinks and a plate all the way to our table.  And it's not like they weren't busy and could have pushed us along, but the whole focus at Capo's was about customer service.  Probably the best service I've had in my life.  When we got to our table, we were immediately given fresh bread and butter and glasses of water.  The bread was so delicious it was hard not to fill up on just that.  The waiter was really pleasant and equally attentive.  We never had empty glasses and services never lagged.  My husband got the Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata and I got the Chef Sleeps with the Fishes.  The Arrabiata was pretty spicy, so if you like spicy make sure to tell them only medium spicy otherwise you may not enjoy it as much.  My dinner was excellent. The flavors were really amazing; the play between the sun-dried tomatoes and cream and prosciutto was pretty amazing. what made this so good was that you could tell the pasta was homemade and fresh.  It really added to the dish.  To finish we got the chocolate covered cannolis, which we delicious.  They were on par with connolis I got in Boston in Little Italy.  Freshly-made just like everything else they serve, it was the perfect ending at a great restaurant.  When we left, I told the host that the reviews didn't do the place justice and he was genuinely pleased.  I look forward to coming back to capo's on our next Vegas trip.",

The music was a bit too loud but that was part of the fun- it was not so loud we couldn't hear each other. The food was good- all 4 in our party were pleased- and better then expected.  Those of us who ordered chicken entrees the portions were perfect.  Those who ordered pasta needed take home boxes.  A bit over the top for an every night stop- but a great choice for a fun special night out.",

Although the exceedingly dim lighting is disconcerting at first, I found it strangely relaxing. A small glass of wine with tip and tax easily runs $16-$17 which I find annoying. Kudos to our waiter for recommending a lower price entree over one twice its cost when a person in our party asked which was better. Service was excellent: wait staff did their job efficiently w/o being intrusive. The place was full on a Monday night. Customers seem to appreciate servings big enough to either promote obesity or provide the next day's breakfast or lunch. Definitely not for trendy foodies or folks looking for light cuisine.",

This place is cool and very different! It's definitely not just your typical restaurant based on theme and originality.  It super quiet on the outside of the building on a near creepy level lol . Soooo before you enter you see a sign that says \"Ring the door bell for entrance\". which we  did because we were hungry lol. Then a few seconds later, a small peek window behind a photo frame opened and this dudes face pokes out asking pass word questions in order to enter the business. LOL  At first i was like WTF !!! lol but It was a pretty cool way to be unique and give you that Mobster feel. (I thought I was John Gotti for a second) LOL After that he opened a hidden door and it is pretty dark in there and looks pretty old school yet comfy with nicely set tables and booths.  Customer Service was great and they made you feel at home. The food is amazing and flavorful with authentic and perfect seasoning.  I am chicken parm addict and my sandwich was made to perfection and french fries were amazing !!!!! They had some of the most unique Mob names for dishes that were really creative and funny to me. I loved it !!! I will definitely be back when visiting Vegas to try more on the menu for sure.   My only negative was that the dim setting after while was kind of rough on the eyes when sitting in it for a long period of time but other than that great experience !!!",

I knew the back story but the kids and wife didnt and long story short they loved it! The food was amazing across the board, even my moody 14 year old teenage son said it was the best he had ever had.  The Calamari was probably the best I have ever had, it was tender as opposed to chewy and just the perfect amount of breading. We also ordered the garlic cheese bread which was perfect, a blackened chicken ceaser(once again amazing-we like the shredded romain as opposed to the rough cut romaine) and also shared linquini and clams and the lasagna. Just a delicious meal across the board, and for a bit got to enjoy the piano player tinkling the ivories.   The service was fine and attentative, the food excellant-if I was a Vegas local I would love to hang at the bar and listen to the piano player. Super cool place and while it was not close to the strip-worth going to the fringes for the food and the atmosphere.",

This place has a very speakeasy-type feel to it, from the secret entrance to the dark ambience, to the decor, to the mobster movies playing on the TVs.  What we had:  Santucci's Pasta--this hit the spot for me!  I had been craving some simple, but special, spaghetti pasta and this met and exceeded all expectations!  Got it w the meatball and it just made my day...I would go back just for this dish...simple, but special.  Big Dom's Primavera--the Mrs had this and it looked amazing :-).  Full of fresh veggies of all types tossed in a light olive oil.  By the end of the meal, there wasn't a veggie left on the plate...enough said!  Da Mob Meatball Sandwich--the little one had this and she really did a number on it.  The meatballs are awesome and when you load them up in a sandwich, it was something that just makes your mouth water :-P  Truly a hidden gem in a pretty obscure area, but a place that I would seek out next time I am back in the City!  Happy eating!",

Our group came in for a bachelor party, typically I never eat off the strip in Vegas but so glad we did.   The meatball appetizer was on point. Meatballs are about the size of a softball and packed full of flavor. According to the menu it is Al Capone's family recipe.   The bruschetta was good, not amazing but still better then average.   For dinner I ordered the  \"Stuffed Chicken Anastasia\" for my sides I went with the pasta fagioli and mushroom risotto. The soup was good, I would have preferred it with out beans but still a good soup. The mushroom risotto was awesome. The stuffed chicken was great, i wish I could have finished it but I was just to full.   Someone at out table ordered the rib eye and was very pleased with it. The lasagna was good ash huge, easily could be split into two meals.   I highly recommend visiting on your trip to Vegas or a fun dinner if you are a local. I'll be back for sure on my next trip to Vegas.  I'm looking forward to trying a few other things in the menu.",

    "text": "This is a fun and tasty place to go for yummy, homemade Italian food in a speak easy, \"mob\" setting with a live lounge singer, singing Sinatra (not sure if he sang others' songs because I was too busy blabbing and eating)!  The service was friendly and efficient. So, 5 stars for the whole experience. It's refreshing to do something different. We live in CA. and this seemed more like a place locals frequent than Strip tourists. The prices are more reasonable than Strip prices as well.   BEGINNINGS: I recommend Fried Ravioli as a great appetizer choice - love the pink sauce. (I did not try their famous meatballs). Heck, I would probably make the fried ravioli my main course next time by ordering two and get the (very good) dinner salad with the creamy garlic dressing for sure to start. We also gobbled up the delicious garlic cheese bread - it also came with that delectable pink sauce for dipping. Probably could have had a tad more garlic on the garlic bread but it was still soooo good!    MAIN COURSES: I did enjoy the Chicken Lucchese (sp?) as my main course. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the Chicken Marsala and my friend said the Linguini and Clams was perfect.   SIDE: The garlic mashed potatoes were not so good to me... the skins are left on and I found them to be pasty/starchy, so probably best to skip those if that doesn't sound good to you.   DESSERT: Last comment is about their cheesecake. Have to say I've had much better. Should have ordered Tiramisu.   YES: At any rate, can't wait to eat here again when we come back to Vegas!!!!! You should definitely check this place out!",

Service was top notch and very personable!!! They were very helpful with multiple tables in making choices in what to eat. If your looking for a popular dish to pick unfortunately your in for a long meal because there are several popular dishes even some that are not on the menu!! Tip is have an idea of what your hungry for and tell the staff so they can best guide you.  The Sugo is as good as I have ever had in the resturant setting. They spend the time to crank out an original old world Italian family recipe sauce.  We shared the meatball and peppers app. The appetizer comes with 2 huge perfectly flavored meatballs and some green peppers in the Sugo.  Be sure and have extra bread here that sauce is amazing. The big doms Primavera was delicious too and huge portion on the lunch menu. Will be back to enjoy the dinner with live lounge singer experience and more Sugo!!!!",

    "text": "We arrived without a reservation at this popular spot, yet were treated with respect and given a booth at the front of the restaurant across from the kitchen. It wasn't the best seat in the house, but we were appreciative in that we had traveled quite a ways to eat here. The dark, speak easy atmosphere was fun and the wait staff was attentive and pleasant. We ordered the chicken Marsala and a huge meatball with a side of spaghetti. We paid $10 to split the Marsala dish, but it really wasn't large enough to split. In retrospect, I would have opted to have the meatball and pasta as my dish, and given the Marsala dish to my date, which is what happened anyway. The bread and salad arrived quickly. Both were good. The bread had a pleasant garlic flavor. We waited quite a bit for our entries. The spaghetti and meatball were hot, just the way I like my food to arrive. The Chicken Marsala dish was flavorful with plenty of delicious sauce with deep wine flavors and an abundance of mushrooms. It also was lukewarm, which was a disappointment. The menu was quite extensive. We want to return to try the lasagna which received great reviews and the Chicken Parmigiana which is said to be very generous in portions. It was an overall great experience. I would recommend reservations even on at 5:00 pm on a Wednesday evening.",

    "text": "Love this place! It was recommended from our hotel staff at the Hilton Alara, and boy were we not disappointed! My boyfriend and I love trying new places to eat and when in Vegas we try to get off the strip if possible and try more local cuisine. We heard rumors about this place being sort of a hidden entrance and that's exactly right. I won't spoil anything but you will be blown away just by how they answer the door! We were not aware it was reservations only, however the greeter asked if we would like to sit at the bar and sat us right away. The bar was VERY roomy with great big chairs and an awesome view of the kitchen! I actually would prefer to sit there in the future.   The atmosphere was great! Very dim romantic lighting and live music (which wasn't too loud) very Frank Sanatra like, very good ambiance and a nice swanky feel. They have the leather tufted booths with candle light. The menu wasn't too overwhelming and offered your basic Italian favorites. The salad was very good and of course the bread was on point as I am always a sucker for good bread.  My boyfriend and I split the fettuccine pesto with chicken and broccoli and it was SOOO stinking good! The only thing I didn't like was they charge a $8 splitting fee because you get another salad, I would have preferred to just go without the salad next time, but none the less it was totally worth every penny! Definitely a great date night place",

The food was delicious--we each got a variation of the classic pasta dish... I'd eat it every day. We also enjoyed several glasses of Pinot Noir and several loaves of bread... So good!

I was like a kid in a candy store with the ambiance, photos of real and fictional mobsters, perfect dim lighting, and live music. Oh, and to top it all off, the food was great (I had the chicken parm)! My wife and I were promptly greeted and seated at our reservation time. We got The Godfather themed dining area and they were even playing the godfather movie. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because this seating area was right next to the kitchen, with only a cloth separation, and we could hear the staff talking and joking the entire dinner. It was a little distracting at first but once the music started, the chatter kind of got drowned out. Will definitely come back again next time we're in Vegas, but will request a different seating area. Highly recommend this place!",

When the appetizers came, the waiter forgot one of the two we ordered.  He finally came back after our salad was served.  Blaming the kitchen for forgetting instead of himself....  I thought the food was going to be amazing because of all the reviews, but to me, the food was over priced and mediocre in flavor and presentation.

I won't spoil the entrance to this place but it is a speakeasy! The restaurant has a dark ambiance that feels like you are eating with The Godfather but it is not gimmicky. They have a lounge singer which is a nice touch and he is not too in your face either. I cannot express how good the food was. I had the tortellini special with added meatball. Best pasta sauce I ever had! Service was great and everything else fantastic. I have been to all the great Italian restaurants on the strip... Scarpetta, Il Mulino, Rao's, etc and Capo's is better than all of them!",

    "text": "Recommendations come highly for Capo's Italian, and I was definitely intrigued.  How can one not be when you hear about their mysterious greeting?  The BF (now the Big F) and I walked in without reservations on a Sunday evening.  For our party of two, we got to sit on stage.  For future reference, there are very cool romantic booths also available.  We went straight for their \"Made-Man Pastas.\"  The Big F chose \"Capo's Lasagna\" for $18.50.  It's \"lasagna pasta layered with Italian sausage, crushed meatballs, ricotta cheese and fresh herbs topped with Capo's special sugo and cheeses.\"  He also added a Homemade Italian Meatball for $6.  (Although it does say 'meatballs' on the menu, it's really one big meatball.)  I chose the \"Tortellini Trafficante\" for $18.50, \"pasta rings stuffed with cheese served with proscuitto, peas and mushrooms in our creamy alfredo sauce.\"  I also paid $4 for the added Italian Sausage.  Both dinners are served with bread, butter, and a choice of Pasta Faggioli, Tony's Duck Soup, or their House Salad.  We both chose \"Tony's Duck Soup\" because the name sounded crazy enough.  They describe it as \"Italian egg drop soup with garlic, spinach, and a touch of crushed red pepper.\"  The soup was simple, but a bit too salty for my tastes.  Although the Big F enjoyed his lasagna, he thought it could be better.  He did finish it all up though.  My tortellini dish was good with its creamy sauce, but definitely very heavy.  (I had leftovers.)  The added Italian sausage wasn't particularly a favorite of mine either, perhaps my tastes aren't refined enough.  As a result, we never made it to dessert.  With names like \"Ma Barker's Cobbler,\" \"Leo's Lips Lava Cake,\" and \"Dillinger's Chocolate Covered Cannoli's,\" you're saddened you missed out.   For the ambiance, I'll give it a solid five stars.  The restaurant really does make you feel like you're part of this secret society.  It would be great for groups or a dinner for two.    In terms of food, I'd give it a 3.    Overall, a four star rating.  (Pics of our dinner are posted!)  Apparently they also have a happy hour from 5 to 7 pm!",

I expected a lunch menu pricing.  NOPE! Fugettaboutit! Nothing less than $8.95 for a burger.   I paid $10.95 for what was supposed to be meat/sausage lasagna and I expected a fairly good portion.  What I got was a small square 3x3 in of cheezy layers of noodles swimming in sauce. Very little meat, NO bread, no garlic knots... nothing.   I ordered take out, but really I felt it was way over priced for what I got.  Should have been offered bread to sop up the sauce and to stretch out the meal, cuz I sure didn't get enough food.

    "text": "MUST READ ! MUST READ ! MUST READ!   This is my first time to sit down and write a review about anything but after tonight I can't keep quiet.  I've been going to Capos for years to starting with there first location on Tropicana. I must say the food is always great. I've celebrated birthdays, anniversary's, New Years eve and just for the hell of it lets go to Capos. But, tonight was the worst experience I had.  First we get greeted by the rudest man at the door he has no smile, no warmth, you can tell he was flustered. We're sitting with another couple waiting for a table. He calls both of us up and seats us in this \"private room\" next to each other. With no menus. And the room had to be hitting 85 degrees and humidity 120. After sitting for about 5 some one dropped off menus. The place is so dark you need a little flash light to read the menu MINE DIDNT work. I had to ask about the Chefs Specials for the night.  I get up and ask what i think is a host slash manager slash mater'd to either A. turn the air down in that room or B. Move us to the main dinning room where you can tell it's much cooler by like 10 degrees. He intel responds in his rude italian over worked voice \"thats gonna be 20 minutes or so\". I go back to my table start fanning my self and just waiting for an open table. He comes up to our table and says \"you can eat at the  bar if you want\". I told him i didn't make a reservation to sit at the \"bar\". He responds with \"what do you want me to do then\"? With his face in my face and body language like he wanted to pounce on me. I just tell him \"TO FIX THE PROBLEM\" either fix the air or move me. He storms off.  By this time one or our appetizers hits our table. So we start eating the waitress comes up to us with our second appetizer and says your other table is ready. Im like great picked up my glass and bottled water and followed her leaving our first appetizer at the original table. We get sat in a booth in the main dinning room. First relief because its much cooler. Then we realize the table had not been wiped from the  previous guest ( which by this point that did not bug me at all). The buss boy sees that and wiped the table for us and apologizes.  Well wed like to eat our salads that were dropped off with our second appetizer but we have no utensils. We tell our server that our calamari is on the table still she respond \"i thought you where done with that\"? I had about 4 bites. So she goes back im thinking shes retrieving our appetizer or re firing a new one. Finally we get our silver ware by the bus boy and no bread.  We ask her wheres our calamari she says \" you ate most of it\" so by this point now shes being rude and defensive. So i tell her \" am i S.O.L on my calamari? She responds with well i can have them make a half batch because you ate half. I looked at her and i almost wanted to just over turn my table in that restaurant.  Im like i want my check im OUT OF HERE...... She gets her manager slash host slash mater'd. And hes like why are they leaving ? i did everything they wanted. He tells her to fire a calamari. By this point its to late I let him have it. Im so disgusted by the customer service theres no way to fix the situation. I told him ive been in the hospitality industry for 12 years and thats not the way you handle a situation. His last words to me where \"Wheres your restaurant ill go eat there\".....  I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN SUCH DISGUSTING, VILE, HOSTILE PLACE IN MY LIFE. I dont have a restaurant THANK GOD! But let me tell you this i never made a customer that mad that he stormed out of the restaurant i was managing. Im posting this on YELP, and on my Facebook that has over 500 friends, family, and clients.   And let me tell you this i see my clients daily and we do is talk about Las Vegas food, shows, restaurants, As god as my witness i will bad mouth you and tell everyone i ever meet about this experience. When i have friends come to Vegas this is one Restaurant that i will not be taking them to.   So keep up the great work and the great customer service. Maybe thats why your first original location closed, and thats why you have 2 for 1 on Tuesdays and you are on groupon every other day. Bigger better restaurants have closed there doors you can too..............  With out us THE CUSTOMERS REMEMBER YOU ARE NOTHING !!!!!!!!  I HOPE YOU THE WORST I HOPE YOU CLOSE AND I HOPE YOU NEVER GET ANOTHER JOB IN LAS VEGAS.........  DISGUSTING ! DISGUSTING ! DISGUSTING !",

Everyone who came to our table to either take our order, take a picture, or bring us our drinks, were very kind.   Our food was awesome! Everyone of us (there were 5 of us) really liked our food.

    "text": "Visited Capo's on Sahara for dinner last Friday. We were seated toward the front where the bar area is, which was disappointing as I wanted the more formal, romantic atmosphere of the dining room. So I know in the future to request a dining room table.  We ordered the antipasto appetizer, but it arrived without cheese. HUH?! How does one NOT put cheese on an antipasto? Isn't that like Italian Cooking 101? The meats, lettuce and balsamic dressing were wonderful, but it needed the cheese for balance. After what seemed to be a communication issue with our server, to where he actually told me that the dish does not come with cheese ... I then showed him the description on the menu which clearly stated \"meats AND cheeses\".  Only then did he seem to get it, apologize, and offer to get us another. We both had the Pasta Fagioli soup and enjoyed it very much along with the yummy bread basket.  I enjoyed Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata Rigatoni with spicey garlic sauce. I also ordered a meatball (really good), which was initially forgotten and no doubt was off cavorting somewhere with my lost antipasto cheeses.  But our waiter fetched me a meatball and I was happy. My date enjoyed his cheesey mushroom ravioli dish, although it seemed a little overcooked and pasty to my taste.  The Tiramisu was delicious with an after-dinner espresso to kick my energy level back up to pre-pasta levels.  All in all, Capo's is a different kind of dining experience and their food is good, but I was not wow'd.  Would probably return, but not in any hurry to do so, and must remember to request the dining room next time.",

I agree with other Yelpers that the food is okay but the atmosphere is what really makes it a special experience.  I had the duck soup and the angel hair pasta pomodoro.  I don't think there was any duck in the soup but it was tasty.  The singer was great.  He sounded a lot like Frank Sinatra - at least to a non-expert like me.  My boyfriend and I didn't rent a car so we took the bus and it took quite awhile to get to Capo's.  So, if you decide to take the Deuce down and then catch another bus, keep in mind it's pretty far west from the Strip.",

I came here especially for the veal parmigiana. let's get started on the food I ordered linguine and clams with red sauce. well the clams was so like rubber I had to chew each claim for 10 minutes and still ending up swallowing the whole claM that's how rubber way they were. then I also ordered shrimp scampi and I had them put prosciutto and sundried tomatoes which I seen was already in another dish but do not like the garlic cream sauce and fettuccine I wanted angel hair with the shrimp scampi sauce so that's why I added to the sun dried tomatoes and prosciutto witch cost extra actual which I had no idea it was going to cost extra since it was already on the menu but anyways the prosciutto was actually deli ham it was not prosciutto at all. but other than that the shrimp scampi was the only good thing oh almost forgot the appetizers we ordered the calamari which was also rubber very very very bad rubber and undercooked and the breading did not stay on  as soon as you pick it up the breading will fall off and it was rubber and just terrible. we also got the fried mushrooms they were out of a can they were not fresh mushrooms They from a can. also got their famous meatball I did not see anything famous about it just an ordinary meatball. ask for the service I had a very bad waitress don't know her name kept giving me attitude and Service was just not what I expected very bad and did not feel welcome at all I was actually afraid for her to take a picture of me for my birthday. I seen the other waiters they have personality joking laughing suggesting menu items mine  did not do any of that. as for entertainment it wasn't the regular guy in the other reviews that sings Frank Sinatra Dean Martin it was some other guy that sang like Billie Joe or things like that and mostly played piano maybe for like 2 songs and then the rest was just recording music radio. restaurant is super small and stuffy I thought it would have been a bigger nicer <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurants.so&s=f88b9c160a28dd33cf4037b1d2a524bcd094118e907cf1e784bc143cf8b576ab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurants.so</a> that was it they messed up my birthday had the worst birthday ever not what I expected from other reviews foods with nothing great actually pretty bad service was pretty bad also the only thing that was nice with the decorations and old mafia pictures inside the restaurant and on the building that was it not too sure if I'll come back .there's also no magic man doing tricks I did see him going to table but he did not come to ours",

    "text": "Capos is an interesting experience. First, the entrance will set the mood, but you'll get no spoilers from me. And yes, it is as creepy as the strip mall the restaurant is located in.  We came in at about 5:30 on a Sunday and the place was pretty quiet, but we were told that there were no tables available, only spaces at the bar. No problem, we took the bar. The bartender/waitress was extremely attentive and pleasant and honestly, she was probably the high point of the experience - she was awesome.   The food is good but I have had better. We both ordered chicken parmigiana, and it was exactly what you want when looking for chicken parmigiana but priced higher. You can select your side dish from a few pre-set choices - I went safe for the spagetti on the side which was yummy, my boyfriend ordered mashed potatoes on the side (which, of course, I sampled - those were also good).   The prices are a little steep for sitting at the bar and what you get, but the vibe is cool - very old school Mob. Note the chalk outline on the floor as you walk out.",

    "text": "I'm a schmuck for anything Old Vegas or mob related so obviously this was on my must visit list since moving here.  The atmosphere is great. The side door entrance and questioning through the peephole started it off right. The wooden floors, red plush vinyl booths, damask velvet wallpaper and chandeliers were all great.  The entertainment (Frank Sinatra crooner) was a nice touch. It was only slightly awkward when he came up to the table and made direct eye contact causing me to stop my conversation mid-sentence to act like I was swooning.  The food was good but not anything to write home about. Kinda standard fare for higher than standard prices. If you tell yourself you're coming for the experience and entertainment then you can convince yourself the prices are alright. If you're visiting in town you probably budgeted for paying too much for everything anyway. If you're local... come for the 2 for one entree deal they have on Tuesdays.  *If you want a nice booth near the entertainment you must request it when you make your reservation.",

    "text": "Worst manager I have ever encountered in my life! Manager was so rude! It would have been a great dining experience until the manager showed up and kicked us out for having a service dog. And it was not a big deal but she did it in a very rudely way. She screamed at us while she was on the phone and came back when she got done with her call and screamed some more. She violated my neighbor's rights for having a service dog. All the waiters and waitresses are very nice but I don't know what happened and how the heck this unprofessional, very rude person become a manager! I hope the owner sees this and make the actual great workers there the manager. She just showed how she doesn't deserve to be in that position. Then we spoke to the owner at a later time and pretty much didn't care. Would never recommend this place, definitely would not support a company like that. It's not like their food tasted fantastic. So sad for this place, we like going to tiny local restaurants but it's sad to see a company who doesn't care about their customers.",

Thanks so much to the lovely reservation taker for getting my party of 4 in before we headed to the strip to see Barbara! While we were in a bit of a hurry our dinner didn't feel rushed at all, the reservation lady had communicated to our waiter our situation in advance.   Service was nicely timed, Caesar salad was delicious. My penne with vodka sauce and shrimp was overpriced at $30. 4 nicely sized and perfectly cooked shrimp, still only 4. But delicious. Be aware that they cook the pasta al dente. I prefer mine more cooked, so my bad for not requesting it that way. Vodka sauce was so good I wanted to lick the plate! My niece has declared Capo's her new favorite Italian restaurant after having the clams with red sauce...a generous portion of clams, too. One of our gals had stuffed mushrooms as her entree and the portion was satisfying as well as delicious.  Singer's volume was a bit loud for our older ears, but a lovely voice and great music selection.  Thanks, Capo's, for a very nice and delicious dinner.",

    "text": "My fiance and I were planning a fake gangster vegas wedding. I wore a flapper dress with homemade feather headdress, fiance wore pinstripe suit with fedora, my sister-in-law wore pinstripe suit with fedora. We were dressed to a T and ready for a gangster dinner before the big fake night.  We walked up and the building had that aura of gangster, complete with pictures of famous gangsters. The door was set up like a speak easy. You stand there and someone slides open a peep hole and asked you what you want. Then the whole wall moves, they had a pay phone on the moving wall. We were not expecting that at all!  They had a cheesy magician who's fake thumb fell off onto our table... wah wah, lame.  The singer was amazing!!! Frank Sinatra all night! We were ordering a lot of drinks, a few varieties, and they were all great. Props to the bartender!!!  \"Frank\" kept hitting on me knowing we were on our way to get \"married\". He got a great tip. ;)  Now onto the food. Oh my!!!!! Cheese bread appetizer. We all ordered different entrees. Fiance: steak and spaghetti, sissy: chicken in white wine sauce and spaghetti, me: ravioli in Alfredo sauce. OHHHH to die for!!! The food was amazing!!!! And I'm a picky eater. Very particular. But all of it was so scrumptious. We were all three trying each other's and fawning over the food.  Three foodies who were super impressed!!! I can't rave more about this place. The price is high, don't expect a $20 meal. I think our bill including drinks (we had 3 lemon drops, 7 shots, a Cosmo, a Manhattan) was around $300? But it was definitely worth the money spent. Definitely worth it!!!",

    "text": "There are TWO \"Capo's Italian Cuisine's\" on yelp so I will copy what I wrote on the other page.  I would come here again just for the experience, not for the food.  This truly is a speak-easy, and most would not expect what happens when you enter the place which makes it fun.  The outside looks like it was once a Hooters, that's because it once was ha ha ha. But you can barely tell when you get inside.  It is very dark inside, very swanky. I loved it because it was romantic. I wish they had real candles on the table, but maybe that is a city ordinance or because it would make the restaurant hotter than it already was. The kitchen is open (hooters give away number 2) so I think  that is what heats up the place.   The menu's come with cute little flashlights so you can read in the dimly lit room, which i thought was a nice touch.  I ordered a pellegrino, I was expecting the bottle to be chilled but it wasn't. I didn't complain though.   Our waitress was a sweetheart and very attentive.    I ordered the Clams and Linguini in a White Sauce - I believe it is called \"The gallows with clams\" - It was alright, kind of soupy with no real flavor..nothing I would write home about.  My boyfriend ordered the \"Sawed off sausage\" but took it back. Not really any sauce and the sausage was just a little too spicy and he already had heartburn. He then ordered the \"Al Capone Carbonara\" - He said it lacked flavor, but once he added a little salt to it, he enjoyed it a bit more.   So dinner was \"Meh\" to say the least.  We ordered the \"Cannoli\" for dessert and that was fantastic! SOOOO delicious.  So like I said we would come back for the experience and the Cannoli.. but thats about it. A little too expensive for the quality of food you actually get.  Have fun!",

We did not, but luckily they were able to seat us at the bar. You enter and ring a bell and a sliding window opens and you get asked for a password (you can check out their website for the password). You then enter a dimly lit space decorated with mob memorabilia. There was also someone singing Sinatra and other Italian favorites. Now the food was absolutely amazing and definitely put this place over the top. I started with a salad with Italian dressing. It was good, nothing remarkable, but good. The ravioli was perfect, with a marinara sauce that wasn't over powering and just the right amount of seasoning. Then I opted for the triple chocolate mousse cake... So good! Light and just the right amount of chocolate (ie not sickeningly sweet or chocolaty). I will definitely return if I ever come back to Vegas.",

The food is amazing, the service is friendly and it's nice to have a live lounge singer.  We could not have enjoyed our last visit more.  Prices are lower than what you would pay on the Strip for much better food and service.  Also, if you call ahead the restaurant can arrange transportation to and from your hotel at a super-reasonable rate (less than a regular taxi).  The driver we got was amazing, and gave us some great tips for our next visit (scheduled for March-2017).  Looking for old-school fun and great food?  This is the place!",

Not what you would consider a traditionally great place for kids but my son, nephew and niece loved the whole hidden entry/password thing, and the lounge act and \"mob bosses\" were very nice and accommodating, and went the extra step to keep them entertained (please, be sure to grease a few palms). I have always found the food to be great and this time everyone in a pretty decent sized party loved what  they ordered and, amazingly, got their dishes all at the same time. That was the first time this entire trip that there wasn't some issue with at least one order. Our waiter was a great kid and worked hard, and even the guys who helps him out bringing water etc was fantastic! The price for a large party was not bad at all considering we had paid almost exactly the same the night before for basic bar food. You know you had a great meal when your back at home and the family is still talking about the food at Capo's!",

    "text": "The first impression is always the best impression.. (Saturday night reservation for 9pm)   1st the hostess.. he was rude.. we had a reservation for 4 people.. when you come in you have to knock on the door.. while my husband boss was still talking to him (hostess) thru the little window.. he closed it on him. Oookay and when he finally opened the door.. we followed him to the back of the restaurant.. instead of him walking us to the table..  he pointed to where our seats were and he walked back to the front..  Now the place was beautiful and the entertainment was greeeaattt.. I think we sat there for a while waiting on a server to pick our table up. We didnt even have a server assigned to us..  anyway we received our drinks super late.. I was served a dirty glass of coke.. I told the busser politely excuse me, my glass is dirty can i have another coke.. he said no problem took the glass to the bar sat it down.. i dont know if he realized it.. but.. he brung me back the same coke i told him to take away.. now i use to be a dishwasher for 4 years so I pay attention to things like this. So i just didnt touch my drink.. we ordered appetizers garlic bread with cheese and calamari.. our party was passing the the food around and when it got to me i was disappointed because where you grip the plate there was dirty food stuck to the bottom of the bowl brim so you can feel it.. our plates werent washed properly.. I was grossed OUT ready to leave.. we couldnt find our server.. she disappeared some where so we were just sitting there..  my asparagus soup was old.. it had a film on top from sitting so long and the middle was cold . You could tell our food sat in the window for a long time. My shrimp was stale (dried out) We ended up being the last party on the floor.. they were closing we had to ask a busser for our check because no one knew where our server was.  Then we see her walking thru the back door like everything was okay.  And this was by far the worst service we've had in a long time..  You need to FIRE THE HOSTESS AND THE SERVER AND RETRAIN THE BUSSER.  P.s my husband got sick",

Worst service\" I am really disappointed this time when I used the bathroom the mouse trap was still in there and dirty and when I was telling my husband this he said there is still a plastic bag over the men's urinal with pee on it\" I know restaurant are off and have bad nights\" but cold chicken parm:( dirty and bad service... Hope this changes I must say I will not be back to see if it does. Food seemed to be pre made and heated something was not right tonight :(",

    "text": "My wife and I went on a Tuesday with two of our friends who are Vegas locals so at least we got the 2-for-1 deal.  Didn't like the darkness. I like to see what I am eating.  But maybe that was better,  because I didn't have to look at my chicken marsala that was drowned in what I think was a dark brown sauce the consistency of mud.  The mushroom risotto I got with it was bland and watery.  My wife got the chicken parm and left half of it on her plate.  The salads that came with the meal were tiny.   Guess you are paying for the speakeasy theme because the prices they charge are way too high for what they give you,  plus you are forced to order way overpriced drinks to get the 2-for -1 deal.  Would have rather they had better food. The only things keeping it from a one-star review were the cheesy garlic bread,  the interesting way you enter the joint and the nice waitress.",

    "text": "Being Italian I feel I have the right to say,**BEWARE** this place was very cool.  The Frank Sinatra singer and the magician were incredible!  With that being said the food was lacking.  I ordered the Chicken piccata, and literal was served one half of a butteflied chicken breast?  When it was served I was going to ask if they were having a shortage of chicken that night?!?!  On occasion my husband and I will split a dessert, this night we each ordered our own, at $10. a pop.  My husband wanted his own because he also was  hungry.  Also another big deal for us was that they will not split checks.  If this is not enough, they also will only take 2 credit cards per check, and even written on the back of the menu.  This was a big issue for us since we were a party of 8, 4 couples.  So to recap it is a fun place, but don't go if you are starving, and don't go with a big party and or bring cash, oh and when splitting a bill people, please remember about TAX, everyone always conveniently forgets about the TAX.......",

I had the eggplant parmigiana, my husband had the scampi, and our kids had the chicken Marsala and pasta. So yummy... Our waiter, Bruce Fiore, was very attentive and really took care of us. Kevin Dicosta sang beautifully throughout the evening. He came to our booth, chatted with us, and really made us feel like family. My daughter loved that he sang her request and dedicated it to us. The whole feel was reminiscent to the Rat Pack.   This place is truly special. My family and I had such a great time and will definitely be back the next time we're in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "I just have to give Lon L. some love for his awesome suggestions and recommendations. I found this great steal for Capo's on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>, and decided that this is where I wanted to go.  Looks can be very decieving, and you certainly can't judge a book by its cover. From the outside, it looked like some crazy run down saloon. I had to convince myself to go further into the restaurant hoping for more interior possas than the outter exterior. When I entered into the restaurant, I was trapped inside a fairly small room. A small computer printed sign directed us to ring the door bell, and rang the door bell is what we did! Up pops open this small peep hole where a gentleman asks if we had reservations. Replying, \"yes\" the phonebooth swings open! Just like the good old days when the prohibition laws were in effect, and the booze was sure to be marvelous.  A mobster looking gentleman, all suited up, guides us through this really dark restaurant, but even the darkness couldn't hide the small awesome crystal chandeliers, vintage wallpaper, and plush seats! I really felt like I was smack dab in the middle of an episode of Boardwalk Empire!   I ordered the clam linuini with white wine sauce, and my partner ordered the veal marsala with angel hair pasta. My pasta was delish! If you're looking for a less filling and very light pasta dish, this would be it! I never finish my pasta, but this time I was really sad that I walked away with no takeout. The sauce was perfect. It was very light and soft, with the taste of the clams lingering in the sauce! You know that they put LEGITIMATE clams in there if the clams were tossed on your plate with the shells still on. NO CANNED CLAMS HERE!   I can't really vouch for the veal marsala, but from what I heard and smelled, it is pretty good. It smelled like it had a very strong tangy taste to it. I was almost to tears when I sat watching my partner eat that poor baby cow...HE DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT TO COW UNIVERSITY YET! Have you no humanity friend!!!!!!!!!  Well, to wash those sad sorrows for the baby cow away, we had the bread pudding with vanilla icing for dessert. The bread pudding is DEVINE! Super soft, filling, light sweetness, and very nutty!  I felt like it was such a small portion, but being full I couldn't complain. Its such a wonderful dessert, but BEWARE! The portions are really small.   Lastly, the staf was A+! The bussers kept taking out empty plates, filling cups, and making sure that they were accomodating. Ellie our server was very helpful with suggestions, and was really nice. Overall, it was a great birthday date! I had a great time, and my partner did too! It's a great date place, but be careful, depending on what the girl date maybe in to, this might make or break the date. But, I can say that men would have a great time here!",

Got seated 30 minutes after the rsvp ppl who had 8 oclock rsvp got seated regardless ... talked to a manager and we got seated but with sarcasm..great way to start a birthday dinner isnt? Douche bag manageral service.. woot. We were informed we had to make a memo for the both. HELLO. WHATS THE POINT IF THERE WAS A SMALL TABLE ALREADY AVAILABLE? AND EVERYONE WHO RSVP AT 8PM GOT IN AHEAD OF US? Still stayed since we waited 30 minutes for the oh so pompus owner/manager not to sit us and just have us waiting like sitting ducks..atleast the staff are fine.  A bit bitter please excuse my critising for the night. I may or maybe not being harsh with this review but hey being a bit liquored up with messed up rsvp. I think im allowed to.   -House bread bread was pretty fresh.. and good combo of cripsy and softness  -ceasar salad..the dressing was good but the greens werent as fresh..  An hour in we were informed our food was going to be delayed. Awesome.   Bread refill please.   Capos lasgna- no wow factor a tad bit dry..not much flavoring minus the garlic..20 for this plate beware  Chef sleeps with the fishes- once again no wow factor.. almost like a plain fettucine w shrimp...27.00   Thank you capos for making my birthday wonderful.",

You do get a little light to read the menu by. The food was very good and the entertainment makes for an enjoyable evening. Since there was 2 couples and the guys were on a business expense account it was no problem getting separate checks and they even called a taxi for us to return to the strip. I would definitely  come back for the atmosphere alone. Give it a try, it's a really neat place.",

    "text": "I was treated here by my boyfriend on Valentines' day :)  Entering the place is very amusing! They definitely take reservations, so call ahead! It would be much better that way! I've heard that this place is actually a speakeasy restaurant, which is very interesting! Since we had a reserved table it was funny to know we had an intimidating body guard by our table the whole night. Oh, the place is really dark. It took awhile for my eyes to adjust.  Since it was valentines' day there was a menu special. Came with appetizer, entree and dessert and a coffee drink (espresso I think?)  I'm not sure if it's a common thing, but our orders took a long time. I'm wondering if it's used to promote digestion between meals. But we weren't left sitting there starving, so we had alot of time to relax and enjoy the atmosphere and each other's company.  There was music playing (godfather's theme 3 times in a row x.x) and a live singer was there for awhile, it was great.  Overall, I think the food was okay, the bill was big ($60-$70 for just two people) However I think anyone who can afford to splurge should visit. It's a good experience.",

A speakeasy/hidden entrance (don't judge the restaurant from it's non-descript shopping mall appearance on the outside) that sets a pretty cool mood for your evening.  Bar and kitchen is right up front where you can watch everything happen -IF you can see...very dark, but again, added to the meal.  Food is excellent and service was very good.  Music is a live singer singing Frank Sinatra toons...a little heavy on the Italian gangster movie posters, but hell, it was still cool and recommended",

We had rude service the first time from a bartender that clearly didn't want to be a bartender and the 3rd time had a young girl who was just as surly and knew nothing about the food and had an attitude.  I can't recommend Capo and we won't be returning.  Casa di Amore also has great atmosphere, food and fantastic friendly service so if you are looking for someplace off the strip with similar food/pricing/music this is a much better choice in my opinion.",

I had a few friends who have been here in the past and have talk so highly of this so they made a reservation for 8 of us on Saturday night at 7 p.m. I was so excited to go and try this. We arrived at 7 with our group and was seated about 10 minutes later our server finally came over took them 15 minutes just to get our drinks and about an hour after we ordered for our food to come to our table. They were busy yes, but not to the point where it should have taken that long there were plenty of open seats available and plenty of servers so not sure what took so long. When we finally got our food my boyfriend's food was wrong so he had to send it back and we even longer for his food to come out. Our friends who recommended this place to us or even disappointed in this visit and very disappointed that they talk so highly of this place just for us to be disappointed. The atmosphere was nice but the service definitely could use some help especially because our ticket ended up being about $400 definitely not worth it.",

We were lucky enough to be placed in the \"movie room\" where Godfather was playing and posters of the movie adorned the walls. The food was AWESOME/ be sure to get the meatball appetizers. Our group had a variety of different items and all were excellent. Service rocked as well. Our server Janeen was fun and very attentive. Highly recommend this place for some off the strip dining!!",

    "text": "Capo's Italian Cuisine exterior has the look of a dilapidated Sizzler's. I wasn't sure it was still open. You kind of fool around near the entrance until you are vetted in. If you wanted some atmosphere before you entered, you got it. I thought I had stumbled upon a real mob joint.  The inside is much bigger than I had imagined. You get that Italian feel for the place with the distinct booth seating and the waiter's outfits. One thing I have noticed, though, is that the service in these huge restaurants can be hit or miss. It feels that there are just a few too many servers when we went. We had people sit after us get their orders taken before us. We were seated but it took a few awkward minutes of waiting to get our drinks ordered. The servers themselves were very attentive and sweet. Just a logistics issue.  As everyone knows, when you come to an Italian restaurant for lunch, the must order item is the hamburger. That wasn't a thing before? Well it might be after you eat their House Specialty, Joey's Burger. What's so special about it? Does it have bacon jam made from special Gyspys who are only found in the Western Alps? I doubt it. It's just a great burger. Meat has that charcoal grill flavor to it. The bun was sturdy and delicious. Sometimes, just eating a good burger than doesn't fall apart is what it's about.  So what's da matta with you?! Go get a burger there already!",

This is a speakeasy style restaurant, so trying to find the entrance as a first timer was a little tricky. Once we found the right door, we rang the bell and a guy slides a little panel and asked if we have reservations. In other words, he wanted to know \"Who sent us!\" Hahaha.   When you enter the actual restaurant, it's a the atmosphere dark, there is a bar with a piano across from it and then dining tables and booths. We were seated, then are server came out, he was very personable and attentive. When you open your menu, there is a little flashlight strung on top of it, this helps you see what you're ordering because of the dim lighting.   Apparently, they are famous for their meatballs, but I decided to save that for next visit since I was sure we would come back just from first impression. We got a bottle of  Mascanto. The boyfriend ordered the Veal. I ordered the Eggplant parm, which comes with your choice of salad I got the garden and for your side your choice of mashed potatoes or pasta, I got the pasta.  Everything was amazing, I love the way the make their food. I have to say as someone who grew up eating Italian food their whole life I was impressed.

    "text": "It is rarity and a luxury for my husband I to get free time to ourselves. Last Saturday our daughter was spending the afternoon with her grandparents so we jumped at the opportunity to have a proper date.   Capos was not really on our radar and it wasn't until we drove past it on our way back from doing some decorating at his office that we decided Italian sounded great. We turned around and got into the parking lot of Capos.  I have to say that I really like the feel and the ambiance of this place. Although it is very dark when you first walk in so make sure to allow time for your eyes to adjust. My husband made a comment that this was the type of place one would bring their mistress. It was dark with high red booths offering privacy and comfort.   Our server was excellent. She was knowledgable, friendly and energetic. She took our drink orders promptly after we were seated. They do have a happy hour menu mon-sat but it is only at the bar.  We opted for one cocktail each... They ranged between $12-14 per.  We started off with their fresh calamari which was lightly battered and complemented by sliced Peperoncinis for that added zest. $14,95  For my entree  I opted for \"Angels a With Dirty Faces\" which was angel hair pasta in pink sauce with peas and mushrooms. I added grilled chicken for an extra fee. $18.95 + $6 for the chicken to be added  My husband had \"Racketeers Ravioli\" which were homemade pasta pillows stuffed with ricotta cheese and he opted for Alfredo sauce as the topping sauce of choice. The ravioli tasted homemade and exactly the way my mom used to make them.  $18.95  We overheard the server explain to a booth behind us that nothing in house is frozen or pre made. She stated that they have a small freezer which houses some of the desserts. That is what I like to hear. You pay the premium for it, but that's what I like to hear.  All entrees come with a choice of soup or salad. I loved their garlic sauce that was on my salad. So delicious!!  The only con were the prices. Even with 2 for 1 entree for locals, we ended up shelling over $70 for the two of us.   Although the food and service were great, I am not thrilled with the price point enough to rush back. I can see the prices being justified because everything is made fresh and portions are fair, but Italian food ingridients generally don't warrant that kind of price unless we are adding seafood, etc.",

    "text": "I have a Roku streaming box, which has a Las Vegas channel loaded on it, and that's where I saw a video of this restaurant, and decided that was where I wanted to go. I stayed at the Luxor hotel and didn't rent a car, so I had to put a pretty big effort getting here which was a combination bus and taxi service. I needed a bus pass for other places, but the taxi was 22.00 with tip. I could have used my bus pass for Sahara west, but wasn't sure of the stops, but was able to use the bus to get back to the strip.                When you get there you find the secret entrance and ring the bell, and the guy opens the slot and with the secret password(\"Auntie G sent me\") opens the door and lets you in. It was just me so they save the tables for couples and groups, so I sat at the bar. Service was fast and I liked the lady bartender, who recommended the steak. I first had the meatball appetizer, which had the most amazing sauce, with a bite to it I can't really describe. Most definitely not a sweet sauce. The steak was very good, cooked medium like I requested, and a very big cut with a lot of flavor, but it just wasn't the best I've ever had. If it had just been a bit more tender, and please don't tell me I requested it overcooked at medium. I've cooked so many steaks on the grill that I know even medium well to well done can be tender with a really good cut of meat from the butcher. I keep in mind that a steak on the strip could have been double the price here, and my bill including 3 pints of beer was only 61.00 before gratuity. Not bad for a popular spot in Vegas! I just wish I trusted my instincts, and had one of their Italian dishes instead of the steak. Especially after sampling the meatball. Still a great meal, and I love the decor and ambiance of the restaurant. Very dark and the menus have tiny flashlights attached so you can read the selections. By the time I left(arrived early) the live entertainment had started! I'm happy I planned and made the effort!",

Friend had chi - town scampi, said it was so good she wanted to take her leftover sauce home with her! 3 hours of laughter, fun & fine dining. Bar manager Gery is attentive & friendly, knows what she's doing, when to bring out espressos! Best bartender there (no surprise she's the manager behind the bar).

This is an old-school Italian-American red sauce joint. I grew up with this kind of food in New Jersey and my Scottish husband has really taken a liking to it.   Been here for both lunch and dinner.   Lunch offers a more limited menu including some specials. The chicken parm (sandwich or entree) is one of the best I've ever had. The sandwich has perfectly breaded chicken, with good gooey cheese on quality bread, and the entree portion of the chicken parm is enormous and so delicious. I don't even like spaghetti and meatballs usually but the spaghetti here with one giant, perfect meatball in amazing red sauce is my exception for that.   If you can save room for dessert, have the cheesecake or cannoli.   Nice wines and cocktails, service is really friendly and good overall.   Interior is awesome with booths scattered throughout, dark and great ambiance (as long as you ignore that half the pictures on the walls are of gangsters and other violent mass killers).  Italians who are actually from Italy probably wouldn't consider this \"real\" Italian food. But it's Italian-American comfort food at its best, and they do it really, really well.",

Everything from the employees to the decor to the piano player all fit the part. The menu also follows suit with the dishes being named after famous mob/Italian figures from the 1950's. Now to the food, we started with calamari which was killer deep fried and a healthy portion. We also had the mamas meat balls and peppers. Let me tell you, coming from an Italian family, their meat sauce is the TRUTH! Haven't found that real authentic sauce flavor at any of the Italian joints I've hit here in Vegas so far! Went with the chicken Lucchese for my main course which was grilled chicken topped with mozzarella and broccoli, very unique for an Italian dish and loved every bit of it! If you're looking to feel like a mobbster and eat like a mobbster this is the place to hit up!",

When I advertised that our group was going, I received 3 calls from other groups telling me not to go there because they would not give separate checks. Well, people wanted to see what it was like and we had not been there in 3 years so we went.

The presentation of the speakeasy leaves room for improvement. The musical entertainment was weak and I think the servers and wait staff could have been more effective in character. We had a nice evening, but I was expecting more atmosphere based on the reputation. Once they raise the bar on \"the show\", this could be a five-star experience.",

First off, the ambiance is everything you want an Italian restaurant to be. The moment we entered, we were transported back to a place and time you can only find in history books and museums. It was the dimly lit lounge of yesteryear, with the rich sounds of Dean Martin and Bobby Darin filling your ears, while the intoxicating aroma from the kitchen gets your mouth watering before you even sit down.   Francisco and Carlos took explicit care in making our evening great. Our glasses were never empty, and our every need was met immediately and with a smile. Francisco led us through the menu to select what was to be one of the finest dinners we've ever had. The meatballs... oh my god, the meatballs. I don't even have the words.   Come with a group so you can try different entrees! Tonight we enjoyed Eggplant Parmesan, Lasagne, Santucci's Pasta, and Stuffed Chicken Anastasia. Every single bite was more than delicious. We left the restaurant with full bellies and a sense of euphoria I struggle to describe.  This place will be on our agenda every time we come to Vegas, and we cannot wait for next time. Salud!",

Well dressed servers and live music adds to the ambiance. Our server was Ed. Very friendly and professional. In fact, two other guys brought as beverage refills during our visit and they were cool also.  Food was very good. Loved the meatball sandwich, but the chicken parm was fantastic. Like straight out of an Italian grandma's kitchen!!! It's hard to order something different, but I really want too!  2 different people (I assume managers) stopped by our table to ask if everything was cool and if we needed anything.  Love this place!!!",

From the atmosphere to the food, it was an ideal way to celebrate a friend's 30th birthday. The entrance itself has a secret entrance and was of course packed. Making a reservation is necessary and don't forget to earn yourself 5% back by using Yelp check-out!",

A great place to share with friends, too.  Dark inside, & although mini lights are attached to menus we couldn't really see our food.  At end of meal we asked if decaf coffee was fresh, waiter said no, it's been sitting there awhile.  No offer to brew some fresh. My only 2 complaints!  Our check averaged about $55 pp - we shared an appetizer, one entree each, only 1 of us had a glass of wine, two desserts. Best cannelloni since NYC & excellent Spinoni !  We'll return for sure.",

    "text": "Excellent food and unique atmosphere. My sister recommended this place. It has a mob theme and atmosphere. You arrive and enter through a plain door with just a \"C\" painted on it. You then have to knock on another door and someone opens a speakeasy and asks what you want. If you have the password they'll let you in. Upon entering you feel like you are sent back in time. There was a Dean Martin type singer working the crowd while crooning out birthday songs and classics.   The place was packed so we were glad to have reservations. We were sat in a side room away from the action. At first I was a bit disappointed and distracted by the noises coming from the kitchen. Once the singer started up again, the kitchen was much less distracting and I decided it was actually nice to be a bit separated. It was so packed I imagine it'd be hard to have a conversation otherwise.  We ordered Busta Cap stuffed mushrooms....EXCELLENT! My wife ordered lasagna and it was huge and incredible. I had Marsala, which was pretty good, with a side of pasta ala Vodka, very good. For desert we had chocolate mousse, which was good.  Our waiter, perhaps Franco or Frankie, was great, as was the rest of the staff. Drinks always full, always serving the dishes with an \"enjoy\" or \"enjoy your meal\". Franco would give us recommendations and when we would ask questions he would reply with, \"yeah, of course,\" \"you're gonna love it,\" \"forget about it.\" He even had the right accent.  Overall a great experience. One you must have while visiting Las Vegas. It's a few minutes off the strip so if you don't have a car grab an Uber or Lift.",

    "text": "This place was recommended to my husband. He left our date night a surprise. The entrance is totally awesome! The vibe of the restaurant is nice. We had Jeremy as our server. We ordered a beer and Dino's dirty martini. I love a good dirty martini.. and I mean dirty, like swampy dirty. Drinks came out, color of my martini was on point. Took a sip and it was straight olive juice. Told Jeremy about it, he came back and said \"it was made by our new bartender, she said its a 6 count but you can order a side shot if you want.\" I gave him the drink back. Our calamari and caprese were delivered. Calamari was delicious. Caprese had a good flavor but the price is way too high for what you are served. $13.95 for 3 slices of tomatoes, 3 slices of mozzarella and 3 basil leaves is a little steep.   My husband ordered the nightly special, porter house with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies for $49.95. I ordered the \"Chef swims with the fish\" .. it was listed as Jumbo shrimp with sundried tomatoes, creamy garlic sauce with pasta for $26.95 ..  We were served a dinner salad with creamy garlic dressing which had a great taste to it.  At this point I was still wanting a dirty martini, I ordered another Dino's dirty but asked for the olive juice on the side. This was night and day! This was a damn good drink! Jeremy said he had another bartender make it this time.   Our entree is delivered. Porterhouse came out great. Cooked perfectly. The pasta dish had a good taste but there were only 5 shrimp in the entire dish. I was disappointed at that since the menu said Jumbo and these were about the size of a half dollar coin.   They offer a military discount, 10% off food (not alcohol) which is common. Our bill was $126.80 before tax. We had $21.00 in alcohol. He brought back our new bill, the 10% discount was $6.88 .. common math shows that does not add up. I understand that a military discount is a privilege and it's greatly appreciated but at least make sure it adds up to the amount you state.  We paid our bill and left.   Overall experience: Pretty good, few hiccups but nothing to deter us from returning.  Will we return: Probably   Satisfied with prices: Ehh.. not really, they are on the high side but I guess you are paying for the vibe too.",

    "text": "I think we just had an off night and not a representation of normal service- I hope. Not great for a first time dining here. No special occasion, just a date night for husband and I. I made a reservation for 7pm on a locals 2-for-1 Tuesday. I were a little early and waited about 10 minutes to be seated- although walking past tables there were several empty ones. Oh well. We ended up being seated in the bar area- so although the restaurant is beautifully decorated and there was live music the view from our table was of a basketball game on TV and the kitchen. Those chefs bust their butts! I was frustrating that it took nearly 20 minutes before being acknowledged for water and drink orders. We nearly walked- should have.  We had the red Sangria- pretty good. I had the Chicken Marsala with a side of mushroom risotto. He had the Spaghetti and Meatball. He was happy, not thrilled. I was disappointed. Chicken was okay but the risotto was complete flavorless mush. I love mushroom risotto, it is one of my favorite things, make it at home frequently and this was the most disappointing I have had. Instead of arborio rice it tasted (hard to tell with sight as it was so dark) like regular rice in a cream sauce, not the traditional risotto. Management did give a free dessert because we waited so long for a server after being seated. The Cannoli was tasty.  I was excited to eat here. Through a series of frustrations and disappointments I will not come back. Dinner took about 1 1/2 hours and not even that great, I can make better at home. I am not even angry- just disappointed.",

Make sure you bring your cell phone so you can read the menu in the low lighting.  We arrived 1 hour before closing and we found the level of service attention was lacking.  That might be because i ordered a coke and my wife got water, but we were waiting a long time to order, get our food, and get the check.  We had to flag the waiter down because he only visited our table once after we got our food.  Nevertheless - definitely worth a try if you want to get away from strip and try something a little different.",

After parking I walked by the dumpster area that was a disaster and smelled horrible only to find out the entrance was right next to it. Great location for a door Capos, I was already losing my appetite from the foul rotten seafood smell. Through the secret door your welcomed by a dark place. The door man asked me to follow him, I couldn't see a thing and had to let my eyes adjust a minute. I sat at the bar because there was more light there. There is a open kitchen so you can watch the chefs cook. I was kind of let down to see everyone was Mexican cooking. I thought this was Italian but maybe they were good. Wrong. Food sucked. Cold sauce on soggy breaded chicken, over cooked noodles, and a greasy wilted salad. Two things were good here....my beer and my \"Swansons\" cheesecake I saw the cook taking out of the box and putting it on my plate. I guess thats why those had nothing wrong with them because they were already premade. I should have saved my money and got a frozen dinner to go along with my frozen cheesecake. The singer was ok but after each set he would swig down 2 shots of whiskey. After awhile he was just slumped over staring at the floor talking to himself. It was a little amusing. Best part of the night was the scorpion in the restroom. This place may have been good in the beginning now it's a broken down dive bar that's falling apart. Everything is filthy, smells like a old smokey casino, and the employees are either ready to quit themselves or just poorly trained. Everyone looked lost. The funny part it this place uses old family recipes from Italy.....they must have lived in the ghetto part. STAY AWAY!!",

Absolutely ridiculous. We have spent much more on meals before but, the quality of the so call special was terrible then the price unacceptable.  She should have said the price since it was there was nothing on the menu that price.    Another in the party ordered the steak, which was cooked properly but for the cost of this is was a pretty small order and the potatoes were terrible.  The Shrimp in the shrimp scampi was terrible and the pasta spicy.  Ok for us but, for most I think would be way too spicy.  We also got the fettuccine alfredo which was not that good.  We have been here 3 times before and mostly go back for the entertainment but, I think this will be our last time.  The food was not good. They also add the gratuity of 19% to the bill when it came.  Then their Credit Card machine wasn't working so, we had to pay cash.  What's up with that??   I definitely felt ripped off and this was for my parents birthdays.  I don't want to be embarrassed again.   There are hundreds of restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from and this is not on my list any longer.",

The service was horrible.  The restaurant wasn't crowded at all yet we had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  After 15 minutes passed and no server had come to our table we had to go up to the front of the restaurant to retrieve menus.  I love the idea of this place and maybe it's just this location that is bad but the bad service ruined our dining experience for the night.  So many good restaurants in town, we probably won't be returning here.",

    "text": "Me and my bf had eaten here once before about a yr ago, and we totally loved the experience. So much so, we decided to invite my family to capos for dinner the other day, thinking it would be a pleasant change from the olive garden.   Boy, were we wrong.   First off, the restaurant was DARK. I remember it being dimly lit the last time we had dinner there, but not like that.  I couldn't even see the faces of the people surrounding me, much less my food.  Im not one to complain too much about the ambiance, but I know something is wrong when I walk out of there with tired, strained eyes.  Plus, I think there was an alterior motive for this dark lighting, aside from an energy savings technique (more on this later).      The service was crappy, or should i say our waitress was. She didn't know most of the plates offered on the menu, and she was spastic and disconnected.  We all asked for water with no ice, but they gave us the opposite. And we asked for a couple of extra things, like olive oil for bread, but they never made it to our table.   The food was... so-so. Some dishes were overly spiced.  Parents shrimp scampi had 6 shrimps each, tops.  Lasagna was okay.  Overall it was decent, but the first time we went there, the food was way better.  Or maybe it seemed that way because we had a better experience.  Or maybe seeing your food is part of the experience of enjoying it, and if you can't see it, you can't enjoy it.    Lastly, but most importantly, we are certain that they *OVERCHARGED* us. The bill came close to 300 (not including the tip we gave), and altho we thought it was too much, we didn't fight it because we were with my parents (don't wanna look bad) and we couldn't even read the bill. (again, the lighting issue... maybe that's why they keep it so dark in there.)  After tallying up the score at home, we realize that they most likely charged us an 18 to 20 percent gratuity (for a group of 6? Really?) and didn't tell us. (Lucky them, they got two tips).  But that still doesn't account for the total amount that they charged us, so we think that they probably charged us an extra plate as well.  We will never know, because we never saw the receipt properly at the restaurant (try reading a note hand written in pencil in the darkest corner you can manage, and that was our situation) and they didn't give us a receipt to take home.   So in short, poor lighting, bad service, and ridiculous pricing/charging methods will keep us away.  The food definitely isn't worth it.",

    "text": "I have been going here for years every time I'm in town for business, but I knew some changes were happening and they were trying to make it into a family restaurant. So we decided to go anyways not much could have changed. But when we got there 50% of things have changed, from the lighting it was too bright, The staff was always blaming things on other people. Our table was never cleared off of dirty dishes or food. We were never offered a second drink after an hour of being there. All this new picture taking and things are just not for this restaurant, I think they should go back to the way it was, or if they want to keep the high prices on the food for the Entertainement in the ambience to change it back the way they used to have it. Because there's no way that I'm willing to pay for a bland tasting chicken Alfredo meal for $28.  If a family wants to bring their children and friends there for a overprice meal I would say go for it but you could get a better meal someplace else for cheaper. I personally will not be going back for a while till I hear things have changed.",

    "text": "First off its hard for me to write a review so negative about a place I've been and have had wonderful past experiences at, unfortunately over the years Capos has gone down hill.  My 72 year old aunt from Boston and her brother and sister who not to mention are iTALIAN and know there food, figured this would be the best place to dine in.    Of course the whole \"gangster mob\" theme is entertaining but the lighting is way too dark! Especially since we had three people over the age of 60 and eyesight is not great to begin with. When we got inside and got to the table to order drinks the table broke. understandable that accidents happen but we didn't get our drinks until the table was fixed which was 15 min later and not to mention the table was never fixed but we were moved.  They moved us into a whole  different side of the restaurant which was secluded from the dining area  which in some cases would be nice if your on a date but not in this situation.  My grandparents were so short they could barley see over the table top. We got our Cesar salads and it was so drenched with salad dressing and soggy it was unbearable to eat. We Ordered another salad with dressing on the Side and that couldn't even be done right.  So we all ordered the veil parm and to start off  it tasted more like a flattened piece of chicken. Did not get a choice of pasta it was strictly spaghetti and extra cost if you wanted a different style. They pretty much had it pre made and under a heat lamp waiting to be served. The spaghetti was literally only 4oz.  I asked to return the dish and the waitress said no it can't be done and instead brought me a dessert.  I had told her I did not eat dessert and she had said to me sorry that's all you can get.  All I wanted was my $30 refunded off my bill.  Needles to say we had spent $60 on a groupon and our bill came out to $200 so it's not like we were getting our meal for free. So I don't think that anyone should be treated different for having a coupon.   It was sad to see such horrible service at a place with such potential, maybe it was because they were just too busy and overwhelmed.  But this visit was not enjoyable and would not recommend to any of my friends at this point.",

We wanted to get off the strip (we went to the original one - not new one on West Sahara) for a change and I was craving hearty Italian food (it was cold outside this trip!)  We want to the original place  Words cannot describe how much I loved dinner here!  From the fun entrance, the decor, the atmosphere, and the delicious food!  And for the amount of food you get, the prices are reasonable. Especially after you have been eating on the strip/at hotels for a couple days!  I had the rigatoni in meat sauce with a GIANT meatball. It hit the spot!! Exactly as I was craving.  My husband had the lasagna and said it was very good.  We were stuffed full so didn't get to try dessert but I plan on going back!  I liked it so much that I took my leftovers back to the hotel and carefully transported them back home with me the next day - refused to let such yummy food go to waste! Italian food is my all time favorite but a lot of places are very generic/lacking in flavor - this is definitely not one of them.   Plus we got there about 20 minutes before they closed and they in no way made us feel rushed.  Very nice staff!",

After we got seated and we had showed our server that we had a groupon for $100 after that she only came by our table twice, the busser came by at least 10 times. Majority of the time we saw our sever doing nothing but sitting at the bar talking to another person, while our busser was busy with other tables. It took almost 15 minutes for us to pay because no one came to pick up the bill. I was so unsatisfied with their service I had asked another server to speak to their manager in charge, consequently their manager in charge was our server, which I call bull on because the other server was probably just watching out for our server's back. Definitely not going to come back here. I only gave them 2 stars because their busser was doing their job correctly.",

Atmosphere - You enter through the back door into a small room where there is a door bell, you ring the bell and the window opens... They asked us who we were and we gave them our reservation, and then they asked us if we had any weapons (That was a bit overkill) and then they let us enter in through another door to the restaurant. It was very dark inside, so dark inside the menus have little lights in them. There was also a guy who sang and when round to all the tables. He was rather irritating... Ignore him and he'll leave. And he totally put his own money in his tip jar when he set up!  Service - Our server was very attentive and despite other reviews I read that said they are rude when you have a groupon, we used a groupon and they were great.  Food - BORING. I ordered a Caesar salad with shrimp... There weren't even croutons on it... And that was the only green salad on the menu. My boyfriend had a pasta dish. It was average. They did do a good job with the dirty martini and the blue cheese olives  Overall, I am happy I purchased the groupon and checked it out... But I would not pay full price for it. They tried... but the food, no thanks.",

The man yells at us \"What do you want?\" followed by us looking terrified and wondering if we are at a restaurant or in a sketchy place. Then a door opens out of nowhere and we are led inside to an old, italian, speakeasy bar. The decor is awesome! Frank Sinatra is playing, the windows are barred with mirrors, and the entire place is dark.   We begin with a nice glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. The server's recommendation is spot on! We had the Ravioli, Fettucine Alfredo, and the Lasagna. Our entrees came with fresh bread with an amazing herb butter and a generous salad. My boyfriend's ravioli were huge! They were very tasty with a ricotta cheese filling. My lasagna was really good, and the tomato sauce was sweet. My friend had the fettucine. He didn't share and he scarfed it up, down to the last noodle, before I could try it! I guess he liked it. The bar looked really cool but we sat in the red booths because I love booths! Service was excellent, however, the place was quite slow for a Friday night, perhaps because we were eating at 10pm. My friend loves mafia movies so he took a liking to this place. The prices were moderate. We'd love to return when we are in the area again to try out their bar and catch live music next time.",

Starting with the hidden entrance (I won't spoil the surprise for you.  :-) ) to the ambiance, photos of mafioso's on the walls to the food, this is a great place to enjoy some excellent Italian food the way it should be prepared.    High marks are also given to the wait staff and to the host.  We had the meatballs with peppers for an appetizer, followed by lasagna for myself and my wife had the carbonara.  We followed up this wonderful dinner with a slice of cheesecake topped with chocolate sauce.  The portions were just the right size and we left filling full, but not stuffed.    I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Italian cuisine in Las Vegas.  Get off of The Strip and enjoy something local for a change!",

Sometimes you get way too caught up with making sure that you stay in particular hotels, or eat in big name restaurants, but every once in awhile you will find a diamond in the rough so to speak. At the recommendation of a local here 5 of us set out to Capos a speak easy type old style Italian dining experience.   From the minute you walk in the door you are no longer at the Bellagio, the Wynn but back to the days of yesteryear when old style Italian Salons ruled the Vegas Empire.  A dark type setting with booths, tables, long wooden bar is your ambience with Godfather & Goodfellas movies playing in the background and Bobby walking the room singing your old time Sinatra & Vale favorites you know you are in for something different and with hope special as well.   Prices are inexpensive here as all meals come with choice of soup or salad and several drinks at the bar were charged at Happy Hour prices even though it was almost 9PM when we got there nice touch. After sitting we ordered two orders of their meatballs and peppers with homemade spicy sauce and a Chi Town Shrimp scampi. Fresh bread with Garlic butter was fresh and excellent.  These 3 appetizers were more than enough to split for 5.  The meatballs were large not very moist but the tasty, fresh and the sauce very spicy but an excellent accoutrement to this very interesting presentation.  The Shrimp were over bread soaked in scampi sauce. Shrimp a little on the hard side, but the sauce was extremely tasty and very good.  Soups and 1 salad ordered as part of meals. Two Wedding Soups with chunks of Sirloin steak were as expected, the pasta fagoli interesting and again very tasty salads were a wet blue cheese that were very cold and fresh. Again all orders quite large and these were included in the entrees.  Dinners:  Traffacanti Rigatoni was stuffed pasta with Cheese Procusitto in a creamy Alfredo sauce. Excellent dish but there was no mention on the menu that the Rigatoni was \"Spinach Rigatoni\" this was fine as I like that but we were splitting up the dishes and it would have been nice to have known.  A stuffed Chicken Anastasia with Ricotta, Spinach covered in a pink sauce was as described and very tasty with a light coating of bread crumb as well.  A linguini carbarnaro with chicken was one of the best dishes on the table, but it had a tough time competing with the Linguine with fresh white clam sauce. These 4 dishes were split to 5 people & none of us could move after this.    Their Espresso, Cappuccino machine was not working so we skipped desert and coffee enjoyed another drink on the house by the owner and listened to Bobby belt out Sinatra. Tough to leave this little gem but all good things must come to an end.  Very well kept little secret that will definitely be a return trip for me next time I'm in town",

I had previous heard of Capo's but had never been there, but knowing it had a good reputation as being a little different, that's what I suggested and it's where we ended up.  The whole speak easy idea is adorable and definitely fun. The hidden entrance, the password, that whole deal. Very cool.   The food is definitely good, but certainly not the best this Italian has ever had (and not even the best in Vegas, for that matter). Still, I'd have no problem going back. Everyone in our group enjoyed their meals, plus the basil butter with bread was a nice and yummy touch. Oh, the dinner salad was also really great.  The service, however, was fantastic. Drinks were refilled promptly without us ever having to ask, food came quickly and was both fresh and hot. The staff were all incredibly friendly and they gave the place a fun, laid back but professional vibe.    So, while the food is good but nothing to write home about, I give them an extra point for great atmosphere and even better staff.",

    "text": "Absolutely horrible service.   After a great time at the mob museum, my date and I read some of the good reviews and decided we should check this place out. I should have looked at the bad reviews too. When we walked in, we pretty much got yelled at because they didn't open for another hour. We said okay fine, we'll be back.  We went back an hour later, same guy opened the door and asked if we had a reservation. We said no. He said he has no room for us and we can just go and sit at the bar. He did a really offensive gesture and then walked off.   Still standing there in shock, like umm did that really just happen. We decided not to sit at the bar. Especially since we didn't know where the bar was, it's so dark you can't see anything in there.  We couldn't even see how to get out, so we had to wait for him to come back. When he finally did come back, we asked him why he didn't let us know we needed a reservation when we were there an hour earlier. He said 'now you know' and left.  I'm glad I didn't eat there. Ridiculous!",

Food excellent.   The sauces on everything we're very good.   Bread and butter at each table.   Would prefer if butter was in a dish and not kind you have to unwrap.  Had stuffed mushroom app,  very tasty.  Not your normal kind.    We had stuffed pasta and meatball on side, came with soup as a choice.  Also had chicken Anastasia.   Stuffed chicken which was so flavorful and tender.  Picked salad as side.   If you are local and go on Tuesdays, if you order two drinks and two entrees, you get 20% off your bill.     Well worth it.  Very dark in restaurant, they had small flashlight for menu which was nice.    Singer present and sang throughout restaurant.   Great ambiance.   Romantic place too.    Tiramisu was very good as well.   Would definitely go back",

Nervous as hell thinking I'm going to get whacked. We get access into a dim lit walkway. Bars to your right, take a seat wait for your table. Don't cause any trouble don't be a jerk off. They might show you out the back way.   Cool way you get let in, original to say the least. Bar area with a clear view of the cook line. I chose the Veal Parmigiana, come on for get about it! It's was perfect, the Dame ordered the lasagna & she loved it.    Just having fun with this one. Yes it was a great visit to Capo. Being from out of town it's always great to find a place away from all the touristy hoopla... Thank You Capo for a good dining experience.",

    "text": "Right off the bat, to only give Capo's one-star, this is a tough one for us because we went out of our way to make sure and have dinner here with the kids, knowing they also enjoy that old-school feel, not to mention their entertainer, Kevin DeCosta. He's very good!   In addition, regarding our uneventful night, I should point out that I did contact a Manager. I spoke to Dominic (sp?). He was very kind and apologetic. He said that the next time we're in town, let him know. He'll make sure it will be a more enjoyable moment. That's cool and I appreciate his offer. But that doesn't erase the fact of what had happened that night. What was worse - it wasn't just one bad thing. It was three consecutive mistakes, one right after the other, and all by the same person, our server, ASHLEY.   1. When a salad is included with your dinner order, the server will read off the choices. Easy, right? Most of us know this drill, simple. Done. Not exactly. Ashley read off the choices of salads that come with our dinner, including Caesar Salad. We ordered Caesar.   2. Cocktails. We ordered two Vodka Collins. Easy to make. A regular drink for us. Unless specified, unless we \"call\" the type of Vodka, the establishment will give you House Vodka.   3. The bill.  Just over $160.00. We pay with cash,  2-one hundred dollar bills. Easy math. 200 minus 160, forty dollars change. Give or take the loose change. But still, simple math, nothing hard.   But here's the thing... Although she reads off the salads as if they were our choices that come with the dinners, the Caesar salads were actually an extra charge. Not once did she say something along the lines of \"Caesar is extra, is that okay?\"  If she had mentioned this, I promise you we would have said \"yes, that's good.\" Instead, she decided to keep this bit of info from us.   Our Vodka drinks. Although we did our usual ordering of \"Vodka Collins\", and not a \"Call drink\", she went ahead and used Kettle One Vodka, not a house Vodka. In other words, yes, there was an extra charge for that, too.  Our bill. Knowing we should receive approximately forty dollars back, Ashley returned with the change. She left. We opened it, double checked everything, and btw, this is when we also saw the above problems. But to top it off... she didn't short change us fifty cents, not even one dollar. We were short ten dollars!   To have these three things happen all on the same night by the same server, and they all have to do with money... I mean, it has to really make you think. In our eyes, this was not a mistake anymore. She clearly deceived us. Definitely not a good thing. You can accidentally give us ranch dressing over blue cheese. Marinara sauce over Meat sauce. But to not state that there's an extra charge for a Caesar; to assume we wanted Kettle One; and to take an additional ten dollars from OUR money?!!!!  However way you want to look at it, it comes down to this, especially since we were the ones to have the unfortunate experience... Ashley was either told by the company to do this. Or she took it upon herself to take us for our money. Big mistake.   I'll say this again - I did reach out to their Manager. Dominic did offer make things right. I don't know what that entails, but he seemed kind and professional. The experience was the worse we have ever had ANYWHERE. However, my kids like that old-school feel. So if we happen to take a trip to Vegas soon, maybe... just maybe we'll give it another shot. But after what happened, that's really a tough one. And if we do and all is 100% better, I'll revise this review, but until then, that was a terrible way to lose customers. Very deceiving. The thought is more like this, \"After what had happened, can we trust them?\"  To recommend this place would be wrong on my part to the reader. It's clearly spelled out for you, so this is an easy one. If you're looking for that special dinner to go to tonight or the weekend, regardless if you're a local or  visitor, I have to say it might be wise to do the extra homework and browse the many restaurants in Las Vegas and the surrounding areas. Like I said, we're not talking accidentally being served ranch over blue cheese... this is money. Money taken from us. Because of this, Capo's has lost our respect and trust.   And so now as you're deciding, you have to remember: It's your money and it's always your choice.",

Often restaurants that try to capture a scene or time period fall short on food quality or service. Cap's was outstanding from start to finish. The food was fantastic. Some of the best Italian I've had in Vegas. I will 110% return to capo's. Next time I want to try the steak. We had the calamari appetizer. Meatball appetizer (as a meal), chicken parm (no knife needed to cut the chicken) and the sawed off sausage pepper & onions (sauce was unreal) everything was perfect. Our server, Jeremy was great! And they kept the water coming! Never did I have an empty glass. Again. This place was a hard 10!",

One of the most enjoyable parts was the singer who sang Sinatra hits throughout the night.  There was individual table entertainment as we waited for our food to be cooked as well  Ours was a magician who entertained us for a portion of time until our meal was completed.    Awesome food.  We ordered two pasta plates, they were filling and delicious.  We ended up ordering the chocolate covered cannolis and those were magnificent as well.  We will definitely be visiting this hidden gem frequently.  Pro-tip - Let your server know you are a local for a discount.",

Reminiscent of a Sicilian mafia hideout, we literally stood outside the blackened windows, after ringing the doorbell, to be verified before being allowed to enter.  It's dark mood belies a jovial waitstaff and really good food.  We ordered chicken and veal parmigiana, shrimp scampi, and pasta primavera.  All were good, hearty portions and tasteful.  If you are looking for a restaurant with beautifully presented meals, don't go to Capo's.  But if you're looking for good food, a little schtick (think Carnegie Deli), and a respite from the flash and glitz of Las Vegas, then try Capo's Italian Cuisine.  It's an experience.",

Mafia stuff to Rat Pack memorabilia hanging on the walls. The Godfather was playing behind the bar and there was a singer walking around to the tables who was great and very entertaining.  Also a magician came to our table to entertain us, he was very good! Impressive and totally interactive.   The food was delicious.

    "text": "Good Italian food. There is a Capos in San Fran and I was hoping this was as good as that one. The meatball is for sure on point and worth everyone trying. They're very big. I had the calamari as well which was decent but nothing special. I got the pens with a red sauce. The red sauces was not as good as what I have had in North Beach in San Fran, but still good. Restaraunt definitely has an old school mob feel, with singers and mob movies playing in the background. I would definitely go back.",

I resent that e-mail again on 10/27; still no response.",

Pics of famous mafia characters and dishes aptly named to maintain the theme. There were 3 of us that attended and we each had a different pasta dish. Pesto with blackened chicken, spaghetti with meatless meatball and my personal favorite was \"chef swims with the fishes\" fettuccini in a garlic cream sauce with shrimp. Portions were more than sufficient!!",

Have fun with it. When you're seated you will be given menus that have a flashlight attached to it. The inside is very dark! It's supposed to be like a speakeasy ! The music is beautiful a lot of old Vegas music and every night they have a lounge singer! He's fabulous! I always start with an Italian margarita and the bust a cap mushroom appetizer! Delicious ! Be careful with the margaritas they're so tasty you'll keep drinking without even realizing it! The appetizer was great . The bread they bring out is addicting! My boyfriend ordered a second round! We ordered our mains and couldn't have been happier. I ordered the chef sleeps with fishes pasta with shrimp and sundried tomato's. I loved it but added crushed peppers because I like a kick! The man of the night ordered the chicken luchesse, which was chicken broccoli and mushrooms with a wine sauce. Very tasty. The salads were good ! The House balsamic is my favorite. Also the chicken came with a side of mushroom risotto which was a 10! Also if you have a local ID on Tuesdays you buy two drinks and get 20 off your meal.",

If you are, he is personable, friendly, offers you a two-for-one deal, discusses wine selections, and checks back with you frequently to make small talk and to inquire if everything is to your liking. If the manager learns you are a visitor to the state, he does not make any effort to interact with you or acknowledge you in any way. It appears his time and effort are reserved for those who are more likely to return to the establishment because they live there. Although the food was good, its the disparate treatment we received that we'll always remember. It was a first visit for us as well as for the local party who arrived a few minutes after us and were seated two tables away. I'm sure they'll be returning. Despite being frequent visitors to Las Vegas, we will not. The servers were good so poor hospitality seems to be part of \"the Manager's Special.\"",

    "text": "Capo's is an experience that takes you back to old Vegas. Provide the secret password after you've made reservations to get in (or take a look on their website). The speakeasy atmosphere starts from the moment you enter and extends to the host that seats you.   The pasta was great, but the food here was definitely overpriced. A lot of people rave about the Caesar's salad, which was overpriced and overdressed. Tony's duck soup was extremely salty and ridiculously overpriced at $7.95 for a small bowl. Capo's is known for their pastas and one of the favorites is the Scarface shrimp scampi. I admit, I loved the lemon, butter, and white wine sauce and the well-cooked angel hair pasta, but five pieces of shrimp for  $26.95 wasn't worth the price. On top of that, portion sizes are relatively small (unless you get the lasagna). I left still hungry and wishing I had instead ordered the 14 oz. boneless NY strip for $10 more.   However, people come for an off-the-Strip experience, which is what you'll get. In fact, you might even catch an act from The Magic of V, a close-up illusionist and sleight-of-hand artist. I've seen many of the tricks that he performed, but I'm always amazed anyways. Apparently there's a 9:30 show, but we were treated to a table side experience. I would probably come back if an out-of-towner was really craving pasta and a show. Just be ready to pay for on-the-Strip prices.",

Since I'm from Michigan, I heavily rely on my co-workers from California who know of the hot spots to go to for SEMA, and I just usually go where they tell me to go.     However, when you drive 20 minutes off of the strip, and you're across the street from an Infinity dealership at a place that looks like it could have been a closed down dive bar?   You honestly start questioning yourself...   We arrived with our group and walked in the front door... and went through the fun process of getting into a speakeasy.   I won't give details... I'll leave it for someone else.  But we walked in and it completely took the expectations of the outside and put it to shame.   A place that was greatly decorated, live music, lively bartenders, and people all willing to help you find something that you're looking for.     But as our group was seated, the waitresses grabbed our drink orders, and we were told about what Capo's was known for.   We ordered some capped mushrooms, meatballs, and garlic bread.    Our nibbles were fantastic.   The meatballs that we were told about were just what they explained them to be... absolutely amazing.  Spicy yet satisfying.     Our main courses were also great.   There was a large variety of dishes that were ordered since it was a larger group, but all I could hear were the rave reviews for their ribeye steak, chicken alfredo, chicken piccata, and veal.    I could have rolled myself out of the place if I wanted to, however I didn't want to push it... the food was so good I wanted to enjoy the food and possibly take some back to the hotel.    However, there was no more left when I looked down at my plate.    Also, I have rarely ever needed to say that there was too much alcohol in my drink... but their take on a Long Island.... was out of this world.   I had one, and then the 2nd one was just way over the top.     Great service, great food, and a fantastic atmosphere... leaves me to believe that this is one of the True gems of Vegas.",

We arrived for lunch and they were a little bit slow opening the door for us (you have to ring a buzzer and they let you in through a hidden door!).  Once inside, the decor and atmosphere were pretty amazing.  It looked like what you would expect a speakeasy to look like.  We ordered from the limited menu that is made available for the coupon and the limitations were very reasonable (pick a pasta or sandwich as your entree).  My husband and I both picked a pasta dish.  He got the carbonara which he said was the best one he had ever had (high praise coming from my picky husband).  I had the basic spaghetti and marinara sauce and it was pretty amazing as well.  The salad dressing was fantastic (we both had the creamy garlic).  Like I said, they were short-staffed that day, so the service was a bit slow, but overall it was a great experience.",

    "text": "Black velvet wallpaper, red velvet chairs, dark wood bar, sparkly crystal chandeliers, live piano music, door dudes with attitudes, out-of-this-world service, reasonably priced bottles of wine...I totally fell in love with this place. I can't believe I only just now found out about Capos (thanks Yelp!).  I highly recommend Capos for a romantic date night or large groups of friends. It's also a reliable attraction for your stubborn Midwestern relatives who refuse to eat hummus and sushi.  My husband and I intended to enjoy \"Fuggedaboudit Fridays,\" but Capos said \"fuggit\" to that happy hour special. But the bar honored the deal because they're cool like that.  My husband and I split the shrimp scampi appetizer, which is only about five pieces of average sized shrimp set on top of a bed of delicious bread that's soaked in butter and garlic. It was delicious but a little overpriced. Order it during happy hour instead. By the way, an interesting event happened while we sat at the bar. The mobbish door dudes fireman-carried a drunk man from the front door to the back. I don't know if the drunkard was hired to enter the restaurant that way but I thought, \"Wow. That really completes the mob atmosphere.\"  For dinner my husband and I sat in one of the red round booths, split a chicken marsala (I think) and a bottle of old vine Zinfandel ($35). I would have eaten more if I wasn't counting calories.   Capos deserves at least 4.5 stars, based on my first visit. I haven't tried enough of the menu to give it five. Right now, though, I favor Capos over Nora's and Herbs & Rye.",

We ordered 4 entries and none of them came out right from the kitchen. I ordered veal Parm. It comes with a side of spaghetti. There was no grated cheese offered. Something unheard of in a supposedly Italian restaurant. Did I say my Aunt and Cousin are from South Philly so we know Italian. My wife ordered the \"signature\"clams and spaghetti in Red sauce. She got clams in white sauce. My Cousin ordered shrimp scampi. Not spicey. She got extra spicey. We learned later her scami went to another table. The guest of honor, my Aunt, ordered spaghetti and sausage which she didn't get. It evidently got lost in the kitchen. The waitress was very apologetic and in fairness they did take off 2 entries from our bill. But the evening was ruined. If this was a real \"speakeasy\" the chef and owner would have been taken away in a car trunk. I'll be skipping anymore visits to this seudo Italian restaurant any time soon.",

Then a little window opens with an overbearing Italian sayin, \"Ju gotta reserbation?\"  We didn't but he let us in anyway since it was early.  Once inside, I was still scared.  it was DARK, like a fortune tellers den, kinda eery.   We decided to stay and try it.  The service was a little slow to start, but they comped our drinks since they forgot us for the first few minutes.  Their specialty drink menu has some GREAT drink combos that I had never seen before.   I had eggplant parmesean with risotto and wedding soup.  It was excellent.  Hubby had Spagetti and Meatballs, said it was SPICEY but good.  The prices were EXPENSIVE over $20 for pasta plates, over $30 for protein plates.   The singer was excellent.  I would have given higher reviews, but i'm not into the DARK lighting thing.  I had to take home leftovers to actually SEE what I ate. When its so dark,  maybe you don't clean so good....who knows.   Brighten it up a bit and I'll be back again and again.",

Due to the wait, the host offered to seat us at the bar with a 50% discount on our order but more on that later.   This restaurant goes all in with the speakeasy atmosphere. From the moment you step in the door you will recognize it (not to spoil anything like it was spoiled for me). It is dimly lit and there was a man playing piano and singing Frank Sinatra while we ate. Overall, I would say this restaurant nails the vibe it is going for.   On to the food. For appetizer we ordered the Bogey's Bruschetta, which was good but not the best bruschetta i've had. As an entree, I had the Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata and my girlfriend had the Vinnie's Alla Vodka. Both seemed to be drowning in watered down sauce. While I was not expecting much from an Italian restaurant in Vegas (I am from the NY/NJ area), I was disappointed.   When it came time for our check, the bartender who had been taking our orders was thoroughly confused regarding the host's offer. He asked us for proof we worked \"in the industry\" which confused us just as much. Things were eventually figured out when they were able to communicate.   While I am glad I tried Capo's, I would probably skip it my next time in Vegas.",

I don't like sweet drinks and the bartender (Filomena) did a great job mixing the cranberry juice, vodka and Cointreau  & lime without  too much sweetness. We ordered 2 appetizers - the calamari and the meatball. And they were excellent- crunchy calamari and flavorful  huge meatball. Capo is more of a dinner restaurant where you can have a great meal. It is not just a  bar, which is what speakeasies are. The aroma of  food being cooked in their kitchen makes your mouth water. But they do make the place look and feel like a speakeasy- the unassuming shack that is the restaurant, dimly lit, a piano and a singer, they provide little lights for you to see the menu. And to enter you need to press the door bell and someone will ask you why you're there. You just need to give a standard answer - like \"vinny sent me\" . Be original. Go there and enjoy the meal and order your wine and cocktails. And soak in the ambience. And also- they're open for lunch and the price is very reasonable",

    "text": "This place would be more appropriate on the Strip. They attempt the allure of a Rat Pack era Italian dinner club, but with less class. For me, it didn't go over well. The guests in the place look similar to a 2 am crowd down at Fremont Street Experience. I know the establishment can't help this, but that's just the kinda crowd it seems to attract.  The whole speakeasy entrance thing was lost on me. I ended up standing in the entrance for at least 5 minutes before someone finally opened the window and did the whole hassling/heckling thing. It was our friend's birthday, so we had to go through the whole ordeal again to go get presents out of our cars. They should have a secondary entrance for this to save people time.  The bar is nice, except you are seated right in front of the stove, not even 15 feet in front of you, and it's hot mess. It's hot because of the giant flames from the burners, and it's just a mess from all the food. The bathrooms were also a mess; I'm not sure anyone was attending them throughout the night. Also, be wary of the floor. Parts of it seemed to be uneven. It felt like they put construction grade carpeting over old flooring that needed repairs.   The service was meh. We were seated at 8 pm. Didn't have orders taken till about 8.45. The weird \"We're gonna give you a hard time cause we're Italian\" thing seemed to unintentionally extend to our waiter, who seemed all too cool to meet our questions with any helpful answers.   I lived in Italy for just under a decade. And there's a fine line with Italian food trying too hard or not trying enough. This place didn't try enough. My linguini with clams and white sauce had little flavor, although the pasta was cooked very well. Their salad was the best thing I had here. I would consider coming back just for that.   Oh, and they don't split checks. So don't bother asking. Again, everything about this place belongs on the Strip with places like Dick's Last Resort and Tournament of Kings. There's far better Italian food in this city without all the strings attached. I'll stick with Bootlegger or the Italian American Club. Same price, better service, classy joints.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place-especially because we went for my birthday. Hmm.   Setting: My boyfriend surprised me with this place and upon entering it did not disappoint. Really cool speakeasy entrance and when you actually walk in it's very dark and you can see the main dining room within the distance, pianist and singer up front, a walkway towards it with booths to the left and kitchen to the right.   Seating: Unfortunately they were so busy that night that we got the literal first booth by the entrance. Horrible. I could barely make out the music or song being sung up front and you can't see anything beyond the large booth other than the kitchen grill/the the dining bar area (think old school diner with chairs up front and the food cooked in the kitchen you can see), and the restroom sign. *see photos*  SO many people passing by, massive groups next to us waiting for their table, barely could hear and see the entertainment in the main room( I literally walked to it to figure out what was happening), constantly hearing the kitchen pans clanking and chefs yelling to each other, and unappetizing looking up to the restroom sign glaring at me.  Food and drink: super hard to see the menu because of the darkness, but luckily each menu comes with a small super bright light if needed.  I enjoyed their wine and beverage menu. Lots to offer in terms of cocktails and wines. (Went with a Riesling) .  Appetizer-fried ravioli was delicious! Paired with the sauce and salad was on par. Also got the duck egg drop soup and that was delicious as well!  Entrees- my boyfriend got the pesto linguine and we both enjoyed that. I got the scarred shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta, and I wasn't impressed. The sauce was definitely butter/wine which was flavorful, but I hoped it would be creamier and stick to the pasta. The shrimps were over cooked and the pasta seemed bland after the sauce would slide right off.   Service: our server was definitely nice and helpful. I cannot complain about service from our server. Refilled waters, noticed when we finished courses, etc. (However, we were still midway eating and another server came and offered us to go boxes in the middle of dinner...)  Overall, my first experience was mediocre mainly based on our unfortunate seating and my choice of entree. $83 before tip spent on my birthday for a mediocre night. I may come back if I can request a different area and with friends for cocktails and different food.",

Standing in the room, saying the password, being granted access from behind a different door fabulous.   However the service was not. We only had one server and possibly this was to much due to how large the party was. Our drinks lagged being refilled, the salads took awhile before being presented, then the entrees took even longer. We didn't order appetizers as we were on a time frame. Thank goodness we didn't.   There were many dishes ordered, from raviolis, alfredo, meatball, and such.   The food was fair, mine nor the person sitting beside me was hot.   I wish this experience would have been different especially because it was a birthday party and I heard great things about this restaurant.",

Once you arrive you will enter the restaurants foyer and you will need to knock to get in..  The restaurant is very dark but that was part of the theme!  There was six of us.... The service was so-so.  Drinks were slow and we had to ask four times for bread.... they brought butter the first time but no bread.  The food was magnificent! We started with the recommendation of the Meatballs! Yup I and now I'm recommending it to you! It was delicious!  For the main course I had the chicken piccata with a side of fettuccine Alfredo and a few glasses of probably one of the best moscato I've ever had. Finished it up with the lave cake!   My wife had the stuffed rigatoni. I had a few bites of hers and it too was delicious. The only thing about her dish was it had too much sauce. For the record you will never here me say to much sauce, dressing or gravy... but this had too much.  Over all:  -1 Star for having to ask to many times for bread.  yes I would recommend Capos   yes I will be back.",

After standing in a freezing room for ten minutes to get in the building I told the person at the front that we were waiting for one more person. Please get a table ready and we will be at the bar. Great. Sat at the bar and watched my friend ringing your bell standing outside AGAIN. Tried to let her in tried to find someone. Nothing. After ten minutes of her standing in the cold someone finally walked over. I just paid the bar tab and wanted to sit down. Well I was told it will be about 15 minutes..... I said thirty minutes ago we needed a table!! Ok 15 minutes later we sit down and the waitress ERIN told us she would take it nice and slow to let us catch up. Awesome thank you! That was her way of saying she will check on us once a hour.  As we ordered drinks she would drop off one drink for the whole table then come back 20 minutes later with another. The people were disrespectful! The food was horrible! I asked to talk to a manager when I stepped away from the table trying to not embarrass everyone, nothing. I'd think you would do something as a server when everyone at the table takes one bite of their entree and says \"let's go\". But no. Now best of all walking out looking at your \"open kitchen\" as a passing glance seeing the cooks cleaning up you literally see one of them shoe a rodent away with their foot!!! That was it! I've called many times asking to speak to a manager and after the third time with no response I think a few online reviews should know about your rodent problem and your disgusting food. Now we can let AMEX deal with them and the health department.",

Second, the staff...very friendly and helpful. Third, the food....all I can say is wow.  The meatballs took my breath away. What a fantastic recipe and execution.   My wife's salad was awe inspiring and her entree lived up to the hype.  I myself had a secret off menu item that I learned about from a tv show.   Needless to say...off the chart.     The singer crooning all night was fantastic and went out of his way to ensure we were having fun. What a sweetheart.  We tipped him on the way out (no one else had up to that point ...cmon people he is not there because he has nothing else to do).  Overall...an A+   Kudos to the team at Capo's....everyone was working towards a great customer experience and that is exactly what we had!!!!  See you again soon.",

Our waitress was on top of keeping everyone happy.

Not sure if everyone giving this place rave reviews is from Iowa or something, but as someone who knows REAL Italian cooking and what to expect... skip this place. We were all so excited to try Capo's. Over 700 amazing reviews? Have we finally found our new place?  The food sucks. Bad. Extremely garlic-y, yet sauce is still bland and tasteless. Meatballs were nothing special. Cheeses don't taste fresh. Soup was weak, served in a tiny ass bowl with no gusto. The veal was horrible. Just horrible.  At one point I looked to my father, typical wise-guy type, and said \"tourist trap?\"- he laughed and shrugged it off.    Our waitress moved at a glacial pace and the bussers were awkward and brought food out COLD. We actually had to send it back to the kitchen. That's mortifying. I could feel myself getting angrier and angrier as dinner wore on.   You would think for over $200 for 4 people (one of them being 7 yrs old), the food would be fantastic.  Not so much.  At the end of the meal, dad looked over at me and said \"tourist trap.\"  Guess the search continues.",

The entry and the decor for the entire restaurant is 100% on point for the era and the theme they are trying to portray.  Without giving away too many secrets, the hidden door and the speakeasy theme was awesome!  The lunch menu was a little slim, and although great, I would have loved to have more pasta options.  I ended up getting the meatball sandwich and my friend got the chicken parm sandwich.  It was fantastic!!  I wish they would offer a regular salad as a side for the sandwich instead of pasta salad or French friends, but overall the meal and the ambiance was amazing!  I sneaked a peak at the dinner menu and the dinner price point is a little on the high side, with most plates being 20+ dollars.",

Dimly lit with an abundance of red leather/vinyl semi circle banquettes, plus tables for dining.  Chandeliers over the tables were for effect not a light source.  Singer was going through the motions but his voice could not be discerned from his accompanying music track, he stood behind the piano but never did play while we were there. Magician doing table magic was entertaining and capable. We had four diners and four different entrees from Angels with dirty faces, sleeps with the fishes, Vinnys ala vodka with an added meatball (+5$)and the lasagna.  All diners were very pleased with the food, flavorful and ample servings.  Tiramisu and choc covered cannolis were better than average, cappuccino was very small and not as hot as it should have been--- needed to have the cup prewarmend. Cocktails are spendy, but alas we are in Vegas. Worth a visit",

Normally I would think that theme restaurants can be a little cheesy but not the case here, it was just good fun. And I loved the food. Both the italian and ceasar dressing on the salads were great. We had the mushroom caps appetizer-yum! Then the lasagna and spaghetti with meatballs - cooked to all dente perfection! I will recommend this place to everyone headed to Vegas. It's off strip but take an uber instead of a cab and it's much cheaper. Definitely worth the fare!",

My friends and I have raved about this place to friends from London and since I had a Groupon for lunch we brought them in. What a mistake. I'm not sure if it was the fact that we had a Groupon or what the issue was but our experience was terrible. Have been here many times for dinner before and it's been amazing. All I can say is today was the exact opposite. Management should figure something out for their lunch specials and service during lunch otherwise it will be as slow and as terrible as it was today for us. My friends and I don't mind paying for good service and good food but today we paid for only good food. We plan to bring our friends back for dinner to show them exactly what we raved about and hopefully it will be so much better the next time.",

    "text": "About 6 months back at a concierge event for work, I won a $50 gift card to Capo's. I had dined here once previously so I was pretty stoked to have a chance to go again. Also I enjoy when local places are willing to donate meals to other local establishments or events.  The first time I came here, the secret door threw me way off. I won't say too much and ruin in. I will say enjoy it, and play along. This time, I had my 16 year old step son and he was confused and thought we took him to a closed gangster establishment. His reaction was worth it alone.  The lighting is dim, and your menus come with small lights for those who may not be able to see the menu in the dark. (ie: me) There is live entertainment, and a cheesy mob boss who is kind of hanging out and running things. Although he is very involved and I don't believe he sees himself as cheesy one bit. The godfather is playing in the background. (Last time it was Casino) There is even a man selling roses. They go all out with the old school speakeasy type of vibe.  The service was mediocre, don't get me wrong our waitress was pleasant. But slow, and un-attentive. Our drinks went empty and the bread basket was out, often.  The food however made up for it. Meatballs and peppers appetizer is a must. The meatballs are a good quality meat that melt in your mouth the way they should. Just the right amount of spice lingers on your tongue leaving you hungrier than when you arrived. The pasta in all the dishes seemed like they were made in house. The bread and cheeses were fresh and authentic, and the salad came with a great house dressing. I didn't like the cheesecake, but unless its straight from NY or Cheesecake Factory, I usually don't.  Overall, its high priced, but the atmosphere helps out and easily makes this a great place for a date night or special occasion.",

    "text": "What an awesome place!  Vegas trip for husbands bday! There are a gazillion amazing places to eat at in Vegas but decided to surprise my hubby and take him somewhere we'd never get that chance to go to back home. Sure, we could've had amazing steak or delicious burgers down the strip, but fugetaboutit! We needed some mob in our lives. #yolo right? We had such a great time here. Sure it's kind of far from the strip. Yes it looks a little run down. And ya ok, the food isn't amazing. But the experience is the best! From the doorman, to \"GAngsta\" our waitress, to the magician that sat at our table, to the piano singer that we were sat next to. We had a great time and this will be something we will always remember. Thanks Capos!",

So you dont come here for the food you come for the experience of being at a speakeasy during prohibition.  In the evening they have live music which i bet is pretty cool",

    "text": "Found this place from a Travel Channel Show and glad we ventured out. It is further away from The Strip, but I supposed it keeps it a little more \"locals\" style which I like.    I did make reservations, and I do believe they are highly recommended, if not required. You go in through a side entrance and ring the doorbell. All the sudden a peep hole on the other side of the room opens and in True \"speakeasy\" fashion you are asked why you're here and I played along with the passcode from the website.  Then you're lead in through a door behind a payphone.  Very dark inside so it does take a bit to adjust, but the menus come with flashlights if you need it.  The drinks we ordered were very good although I forget the names. We decided to forgo appetizers since we weren't starving. You do get bread and I had the soup with my meal.  The pasta and food was very high quality Italian. Sometimes you go to \"theme restaurants' and they skimp on the food, but that was NOT the case here.  I loved the vibe, they had a singer doing Sinatra and a magician wandering around performing for the tables. It was amazing to see magic that close to you.   I only wish we had a fridge at our hotel so I could continue snacking the rest of the night on this. Very filling. Very good. And worth the short drive from The Strip!",

If you haven't been there yet, your first time will be memorable. Once your in you feel like Al Capone or Bugsy Siegel could walk in at any moment. The crooner serenading everyone with a few people dancing was classic. We had two entrees; the rib eye crusted with artichoke/Gorgonzola, veggies and taters and classic spaghetti and meatballs.

Cheesy garlic bread and mushroom caps for apps. Everybody had something different for an entree and not one person had a bad word to say. The bday girl asked for a particular dish not on the menu and got exactly what she was hoping for with no trouble at all.

    "text": "We were on our way to Vegas and I happened to catch an episode of Mystery Diners or something like that, on Food Network. I really appreciated that they were trying to figure out a way to manage the experience of table side and live entertainment without the added drama of expecting patrons to tip. The place looked nice on the show, so we made a reservation and drove over there during our vacation.  We were kind of confused by the entrance and the vestibule to get in was uncomfortably hot as we tried to figure out if we were at the right place or some kind of mob front... So I guess they have it going on there.   The server was friendly. My husband had an Italian Margarita. It was delicious. I don't care for drinking much, but yum! The cheesy bread was great, as everyone describes. I loved the orange sauce.  I was excited about the table side magician--even though it was a different guy than was featured on the show. The singer was singing along \"dedicating\" songs to everyone in the house. It was kind of annoying because he kept talking to us directly and calling us my name.  As we ate our appetizer, we noted that the table side magician was finishing up with another table--and very directly solicited a tip. This annoyed me because I had taken the show on faith as an infomercial for good, honest service without this pressure.  We passed, very firmly, on the table side entertainment.  After three times of insisting that we would rather engage in intimate conversation, he finally moved along.  Our entrees--ravioli and stuffed rigatoni-- were delicious. We passed on dessert. Had we not been driving back to the strip, my husband would have definitely had another drink--it was that good.  All in all, the food was good.  If you're into mob stuff, you'll probably love it: There are streaming gangster movies in the background.  If you're looking at reviews because you learned about this establishment from the show they were on--it is no longer their policy to refuse tips, and I think that's pretty dishonest to perform, then pretty much demand a tip.",

The other meal ordered was a pasta dish.....22 bucks and was very small in portion size.  For dessert the lava cake....ok but mediocre at best and expected better quality for 10 bucks.

We ordered pastas my husbands sauce was decent but pasta and shrimp were both way under cooked.  My pasta was meant to have an Alfredo sauce and it was just oil. I ordered a side of Alfredo and it was so watery I didn't eat it.  2bartender behind the bar and very slow service.

    "text": "Capo's Italian Cuisine reminds me of the saying- \"Don't Judge a Book By Its Cover\" Once you drive to this restaurant, my impression of the outside, very ghetto. It does look it but it really is not. Its a really unique and cool experience dining here. Besides the look when you enter it will be very gangster, very mafia, mobster feel. Don't let it bother you, me & my other half really enjoyed our lunch. It was our 2oth anniversary lunch. Our Las Vegas trip was for our 20th anniversary celebration and on our special day we dined here. We both had no complaints.   As a FYI- be prepare to eat in the dark, look at your menu in the dark, once you enter and once you get to the table, it is very dark. Guess its a great way to hide from the mobster!! haha. If you don't mind the dark.  My opinion, this is much more romantic. I had a hard time finding the bathroom in the dark and I had to go with my other half. It was really hard taking photos, you will need to use the flash on your phone.   We were in the area stopping at The California hotel and I recalled driving by this place,so I checked Yelp and the ratings and food photos looked awesome so Capo's we will go for lunch. They have a great lunch special so we opt for the special.   OH my!!, Our meals were really delicious except for the salads were mediocre. Our pasta were so authentic. You would be surprised that this place has such amazing food. Our lunch entrees were Capones Carbonara - the fettuccine pasta were al dente, the carbonara sauce was just right, not too rich. Big Dom's Primavera- Penne pasta tossed with fresh vegtables- really loved that the penne was al dente and loved the vegtables sauteed perfect together. Me and the other half tried each other's entree and we enjoyed them both. The entree has interesting names but the description sure matches its name.   Amazing food, great service, and Unique Mobster experience, you have to come check it out for yourself.  Next visit I want to try the calamari, a different entree, and the cannoli.   I can't wait to be back and I will definitely be back @ Capo's during my next Las Vegas vacation!!  #6/100 for 2017",

No one liked the food because it lacked flavor and was over cooked. Eggplant parmigiana had too much crunchy batter. Veal was tough. And enough spaghetti to feed an army. For those kinds of prices I expected better.",

Joey made us some tasty drinks (two thumbs up on the extra dirty martinis for me) while we waited for our table to be ready, which took a matter of minutes. As for the dinner, everything was spot on. The pasta fagioli soup with the hot bread was just awesome; it's honestly the best pasta fagioli soup I've ever had. My mom had the dinner salad, which she also liked. For entrees, my mom had the spaghetti and gigantic meatball, which were excellent. I had the lasagna and it was delicious; it's going to be difficult for me to return and try something different because the lasagna was so, so, good.  My mom and I are Italian and fussy about food, so it's not often I'm this impressed with an Italian restaurant. However, the cool mafia themed atmosphere, great service, and awesome food all combined for a fabulous experience. We will be back for sure!!",

Wasn't chewy at all and the marinara sauce it came with was delicious. My entree was the gallo clams dish with angel hair. I'll probably order this every time!  Perfect amount of garlic, pasta was cooked just right. The boyfriend ordered shrimp scampi he loved it. Lips were glistening with butter lol",

    "text": "GANGSTA YO!  Mark H brought me here because he thought I'd have a fun time...he was right!  Capo's is kind of a mobster throwback when there was an A+ Italian restaurant on every block in Vegas.  When you enter the place, you don't enter from the front, but instead from a small, Semi-unmarked door in the back of the building!  Fkn awesome...LOL.  Once through the door, you're in a small entry space and need to ring a doorbell and talk through a speaker to gain access to the restaurant...even more awesome! :)  Once in, the place is dark with red diamond tufted banquets.  It feels like in any booth you might see people from the likes of Al Capone to Ol' Blue eyes, Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin.  All the servers are dressed in tuxedos and are extremely attentive from the moment you walk in.    Once seated, we were happy they had Hendricks gin and each got a Hendricks and tonic.  Mark H knew that they have large portions so we passed apps and just ordered entrees.  They have some fun sounding dishes with things like Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata and Vinnie's alla vodka. :)  I opted for Da Don's Lasagna and Mark H ordered a special, the Clams in red sauce with linguini.  Both dishes were healthy portions and tasty.  Shamefully I actually finished my monstrous piece of lasagna and was stuffed.  Mark H said his pasta dish was good finished it but did have quite a bit of red sauce left.  That's when I realized we didn't get any bread which should have come with our meal.  No biggie since we were already stuffed and didn't want anything else to eat.    We obviously passed on dessert.  A pretty cool place to eat at in a town FULL of good restaurants.",

The two plates we had were the Santucci's Pasta with a side sausage and the Da don's Lasagna. For our appetizers we decided on the Tony Duck's Soup and Nikos Caeser. Couldn't be happier with the food choices we made! The Pasta has a great authentic tasting sauce that truly made the dish, The added sausage kicks it up a notch. Now the Lasagna, one of the best tasting Lasagna dishes I've had in a while. The smashed meatballs the Ricotta you can taste throughout the dish.

First off, you have to ring a bell to be let in. We waited in the hot vestibule for 8 minutes, and had to ring the bell 4 times before someone opened the sliding door. Next, the waiter took our order but none of the dishes contained meat. Oh, yes, that was an extra $10 FOR 2 SAUSAGES. The waiter disappeared. He only had 3 tables, you see. So, we had to ASK for drink refills. The arabitta is a spicy red sauce. Theirs was not. In fact, it tasted like Ragu spaghetti sauce. I use jars of sauce sometimes but this was not even a good premade sauce. The tea tastes like Lipton instant. For some reason, this seems to be a popular restaurant. I would recommend Roma Deli 1 if you are looking for good Italian food.",

Do not get me wrong, this place is not casual, cheap or lack creativity of dishes. They have the classic chicken parm, all the while including their own spins on pasta dishes and entree's.   Some of my favorite dishes to order here are, chicken parmesan (of course), chicken marsala (the best I've ever had), mushroom risotto, Caesar salad, plain ol' spaghetti and meatballs (I should really say spaghetti and meat boulder, either way, it's <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>).

Not because it was not busy, but they kept their word that a table would be ready. I walked into the foyer to find some good old photographs and a payphone. I rang the bell as instructed and the doorman came to the window. The atmosphere was dark, but they used small lights to to let us see the menu. This is typical of a speakeasy.  So we were seated, and I hope I have the server name right, Gery, came right over. She gave us the specials, and as my date was not Italian friendly, Gery, went though the menu with her. The food came out, and oh my what a great serving for the price. I ordered the Chicken Parm, and it was as close as my family home made recipe. Two people, with one glass of wine, 82.00. This was not bad for this type of eatery.  Defiantly a must see place if you're visiting, or just a local looking for a great place to eat.  Side note, if you bring your significant other, do not be surprised if she gets flirted with by the staff (normal Italian behavior)",

We were recommended by a good friend of this restaurant which she is local Vegas resident. We brought a big group too from NorCal, So Cal and from the UK visiting for the first time.

Even with a reservation we had to wait 15 minutes. The gentlemen that greeted us to ask for the password wasn't even Italian! Smh My hangry boyfriend was not pleased at all with the wait. The Italian Chianti left much to be desired. It tasted cheap. The infamous meatballs were nothing special - just a huge hunk of beef rolled in a ball. The one saving grace of this restaurant was their pink sauce, which was a mixture of marinara and alfredo sauces.  My boyfriend and I both agreed that this was one of the evenings this week that was wasted on mediocre food (followed by Diablos Cantina at Luxor). We will skip this establishment on next year's trip",

We couldn't find the door at first LOL When you enter the restaurant it reminded me those French old night club where you had to show your ID and wallet to enter LOL The restaurant is very dark you almost need a flashlight to see. Great place for blind date I guess. The menu offers many option, it's little expensive ... I ordered a caprese salad and an Alfredo pasta. I would enjoy my meal if only it wasn't that dark. The service is good and they will come often refill your water or drinks. I believe certain days you have some entertainment while dinning. I am glad I experienced this place at least once :)",

    "text": "Situated very inconspicuously in a quiet plaza. This place can be found with it's illuminated sign. The entrance is a bit hidden in the back, but gets even more confusing as you enter. Be sure to find out the password before entering, AND make a reservation.   I won't give up exactly how the entrance works, but just follow the instructions when you enter and you're good from there.  The restaurant is covered with red and black, spanning the entire place. It is very dimly lit, perfect for a romantic evening out. Date night recommended! Our host was a older Italian gentlemen that I swore jumped out from the prohibition days.   The menus come with small illumination to help you read the words. Our dinner started off with bread. It wasn't as warm as we'd like, but still yummy.  Our combo dinners came with soup or salad, so we both chose Pasta Fagioli and Tony Duck's Soup. Both hit the spot. For our entree's we got Fredo's Wise Guy Alfredo and Racketeers Ravioli. Both ridiculously good and creamy. Would definitely have loved to box up leftovers for the fam at home to try, but sadly, everything ended in our bellys. Oh well. More of a reason to visit again.   The mood, servers and even the restaurant singer set everything up. The decorations had all mob faces on it and really set the pace. We will certainly come back--and with more people.",

I've gone the last few times I've been in Vegas and I'll definitely continue to bring friends and family to enjoy the experience as well. The menu has a nice variety, the portions are decent,  and there's a full bar available. It's pricey, so be prepared to spend.   The service has always been spot on and the servers are all friendly. I would advise making a reservation, if not you may end up getting turned away (or stuck at the bar, we did last time and it just wasn't as fun being in a dark corner at the end of the bar).   Lastly, the food. As far as Italian goes, it's good, I enjoy it but I wouldn't say it's the best out there. The meal and the experience compliment each other, they go hand in hand.",

    "text": "Yelp - you let me down on this one. However, it does take a lot to impress me when it comes to Italian food.   Made a reservation and had to wait 30 minutes. There were empty tables, but I suppose the kitchen may have been packed up? Eventually they sat us at the bar which I guess was because we were waiting so long. From the bar, you can see pretty much the whole kitchen - kind of cool because you can see your food being made. But what's annoying is having to hear the arguing and language used by the chefs in the kitchen.  Both me and my boyfriend ordered pasta. The sauce on my pasta was supposed to be \"creamy,\" but creamy it was not. Very watery and plain tasting. Got bruschetta as an appetizer, which was also disappointing and tasted like it came out of a jar. Maybe it's personal preference, but to me this wasn't real homemade Italian food, but merely an impostor of such.  I think the gimmick of this whole place is what is appealing to so many. It's very very dark, mafia themed and does a great job of following such theme. It's so dark you can't even see your food that well. There's live music every night. The night we went was a Frank Sinatra cover singer, he sounded really great.",

So the entrance is a cool experience. You enter and wait in small area and the host opens a small door asking your business, if you have a password and who sent you. Please note, the entrance into the bar and dining area was not what I expected.  As we were seated you definitely feel like your in a old school, old world restaurant with the walls adorn with pictures of famous gangsters and Vegas entertainers. There was even live entertainment with the singer playing songs from the days of the rat pack.  The food was amazing and plentiful, please be prepared to bring home leftovers. My wife had the meatball sandwich and I had the chicken parmesan.   The service was attentive and amazing. Our wait staff never skipped a beat from drinks to the flow of dishes.   On this day, there was a lounge singer busting out all of our favorite songs from the Rat Pack and others that made their way thru early Vegas.   This restaurant is the great combo of food, service and entertainment, I would recommend Capo's if your looking for great food with service to boot.",

After we got in, we got seated. We sat in the main room across from the singer. I don't know what his name is, but he's a wonderful singer. He sings Frank Sinatra hits. And, I think a couple others. (I tipped him five dollars and he was very happy.)  We started off with the stuffed mushrooms. They were pretty good and a little spicy. We also got some lightly toasted bread with butter. I really loved my Tiramisu martini. For my second martini, an orange Creamsicle was recommended. But, I did not like it at all. Luckily for me, the waitress took it away and brought me a 2nd Tiramisu martini. (It tastes just like the dessert!)   For the entrees, I got the \"wise guy\" Alfredo with shrimp and he got the New York steak with pasta on the side. The steak was surprisingly delicious. Capo's is a steakhouse in addition to Italian food. The Alfredo sauce was perfect. It was creamy and it wasn't too greasy like sometimes Alfredo can be. Plus, we did ask for Parmesan cheese. They don't grate it at the table for you, but I do believe that it is freshly grated every day. For dessert, we got the Tiramisu. It was very delicious. Overall, it is a really entertaining and wonderful restaurant.",

    "text": "Came here for a family dinner. Its a speakeasy so it's kind of fun because you need to know the password to get it. You walk into a small room with a phone and a doorbell and you press the doorbell and then this little window opens and you have to tell the guy the right password for entry. It's a very dark restaurant so you have to get used to the lighting. We were seated at a nice booth in the back. The menus have little flashlights inside so you can read them in the darkness. That's a nice idea. They had an extensive gluten free menu which was good because two members of the party are gluten free. The only problem was one of our menus seemed to be missing a page which was kind of strange. We had to share menus to get that figured out. I was very thirsty and drank my water quickly and luckily there was a decanter of water at the table. I also ordered a Diet Coke and asked the server for another. She said she'd bring a decanter of Diet Coke since another member of the party was drinking it too. After waiting about 5 minutes and not getting it and having no sign of the server we asked another busboy who was walking by about it and then the server appeared and said it was coming. Eventually we got it. I wasn't crazy about the service because of this. The server wasn't as attentive as she should have been. The other two members of our party also had to wait a long time before getting their wine refilled. However the food was delicious. We had the gluten free shrimp scampi which that member of our party said was very good. Another member had the gluten free chicken piccata. She said that the meal appeared a bit brown since the chicken looked brown and she had it with the mushroom risotto but she said everything tasted very good. I had the cioppino and it was supposed to come spicy but I asked for it to be milder. It was good but could have used a little more seafood. It did come with a lobster tail which was nice but it only had sliced calamari, a good amount of shrimp, and a small amount of salmon, and some mussels and clams. The broth was good. There was a lot of linguini in it. We also had the salmon piccata. It was a grilled piece of salmon with asparagus and came with risotto. He was happy with his dish. Overall I would say good food but service could have been better. Could have been more attentive. I would come back to try the steak. I want to try the filet.",

The music was live (rat pack standards) and the singer wandered the tables and would strike up conversations with the guests. The service was phenomenal and the servers' food recommendations were spot on!  We had several different crew members walk up to our table to say hi and check on our food. LOVE how personal it all was.   The portions of all our plates were big enough to share but we really didn't want to. Needless to say, we all walked out with food babies and it was well worth it! Noodles were homemade and everything tasted super fresh and authentic. Definitely start with the meatball appetizer!   YES- there were amazing GF/DF options!",

I had the vegetable Penne pasta with Vodka sauce, so yummy . Several people had lasagna and chicken piccata  and nothing but good feedback.  The mushroom risotto was amazing.  We ended the night with cannolis and some of our Italian friends that are \"cannoli snobs\" loved them.   The only thing that I would change is I would suggest investing in lighted menus .  Although I love the dark, romantic atmosphere it was hard to read the menu.  We went to a restaurant at Casa Blanca called Catherine's. That was the first time that I saw lighted menus.  Great idea!",

The host was very nice, funny and welcoming.  We sat and admired the ambiance of a Mob life with live music and singing by the piano.   Our server, which I forgot his name, was reallly nice and witty at the same time.   TIP:  When I asked if we could split the bill the server said no he could only do 2 cards. Perfect! We gave 2 cards but he charged me $2. Hmmm... I said whatever I won't flip out since they accommodated our large party with no reservation.   Food: Calamari  Carbonara  Caprese Angel Hair Spaghetti   My friends ordered a lot more dishes but this is what I ate.  The carbonara was just ok. I've had better. The Spaghetti was much better in flavor.  Now,  the Calamari was delightful.  Best I've ever had. Lightly battered and tender. Not chewy.   Overall, a great experience.  I would definitely return back. The ambiance is dark and older looking that does make you feel like you're in the old days of the speakeasy era.",

So glad we got an early reservation because we were here for 2.5hrs!! Not sure how all that time passed but it sure didn't feel that long. At no time did we feel rushed or anything. The spacing between the appetizers and our salads and dinner was perfect!! We were not in a rush and just enjoyed the atmosphere so if you're in a hurry this probably won't work for you.   The whole old school mafia theme was so much fun!!  Walk in and ring the doorbell for a guy to poke his head out and ask if you have reservations.  We were seated within 3min or so. As other reviews stated this place is very dark but once your eye adjust it didn't bother me at all.   After seated we were quickly greeted by the best server I could have wanted Janeen!! She seriously was awesome. Super friendly, very attentive even when the restaurant quickly filled up and was very busy. She kept our drinks full and made sure we were content and satisfied with everything. I even have to give props to our busser Alex. He was on it!! Cleared out our empty plates quickly without us feeling rushed. LOVE IT!! I'm sorry to those other reviews who got crappy service, if Janeen is working when you come here I hope you get her!!  Ordered drinks, I got the Nico and others got wine and Captain Morgan shots and beer. The Nico was sweet but not overly sweet and delicious. Have no clue what wine the girls ordered but they had zero complaints.   Appetizers we got the fried ravioli and calamari.  The ravioli I definitely recommend because it was DELISH!! Calamari, Ive had better and it was good but i wouldn't suggest it.   Entree wise my brother and his gf got the specials and I forgot what they were and didn't get a pic but, I couldn't decide between the Cioppino or the special which was some kind of scampi so the awesome Janeen said why choose? Let's put the scampi in the cioppino!! What a great freakin idea! My friend got the eggplant parmesan. I love cioppino so I had really high expectations for this dish and holy shit did Capo's deliver!! It was sooooo damn good and the added noodles from the scampi were awesome because I really wanted pasta but had to try their cioppino.   Oh dang, I almost forgot out the awesome Cesar salad I got before dinner!! Not sure how I almost forgot about that but it was DELISH too!! Every piece of lettuce had dressing on it and it was very flavorful!!  My brother got Tiramisu for dessert and we all took a bite, or three. Another winner!!   We will be back in September for my brother's gf birthday we loved it so much!!",

My husband had the veal and I had fettuccine Alfredo and both were phenomenal! We were warned about the expensive prices in advance. But overall, you get your money's worth with endless bread, soup or salad, plus your main course!   We do however wish there could've been slightly more light in the room! We know the dark room plays into the experience, however it's really hard on the eyes. Not to mention how blinding the small lights are on the menus when you use them. Plus, trying to find your way around to the bathroom, your chair, or to the exit is a real pain.   Other than that, we loved Capo's! We'll definitely be coming back more!!",

Upon entering, you will need to knock to get into the restaurant (no spoilers in this review!). If you're visiting from out-of-town, this is a must see restaurant that is off-strip!  We had arrived around 1:00 P.M and the restaurant was fairly empty. Our party consisted of 6 guests and we were immediately seated.   We were provided their lunch menu and full menu.The restaurant is extremely dark inside. You'll need to use their provided flash-light to review the menu.   The customer service was exceptional! I had ordered their meatball sub from the lunch menu. It consisted of two very large meatballs on a white-sub sandwich. The side was french fries. For desert, I had the Salted Caramel Cheesecake. The food was amazing! The meatballs were well seasoned, not overcooked. The french fries had a touch of garlic to them, which was unique and refreshing twist on french fries. The salted caramel cheesecake with nuts was decadent.   The lunch was delicious. I would come back here and try their dinner menu. Supposedly there is a live singer in the evening hours, which sounds super romantic!",

    "text": "There are so many good choices for Italian food in Vegas that a restaurant has to have something to set them apart from the rest.  Capo's has come up with a way to distinguish their \"mobster\" theme.  Guests arrive to an empty foyer with little besides a pay phone and a few framed pictures on the wall.  What is this?  You follow the directions and ring a bell, whereupon a secret hatch opens up and a Jersey-accented thug asks what we want.  After a little back-and-forth the wall holding the pay phone opens to a dimly-lit wonderland of mobster memorabilia.  It's lots of fun!  Walking past the kitchen you see the staff busily preparing the food.  This is pretty much the last you will see of the food at Capo's.  The atmosphere is super fun and the food was tasty too.  I would probably have given them more stars if I could have been able to see what I was eating.  The menus arrive with tiny lights attached to aid in actually reading them.  All around the dining room other patrons are using their cell-phones to catch a glimpse of what they are eating.  There is no reason for this place to be so dark.  Part of the culinary experience for me is to look at the presentation and I completely missed out on it at Capo's.    The food and the concept are great!  Just shed a little light on it all and I think they'd have a five-star restaurant.",

Unfortunately, there were surprises on the bill at the end of the meal that put a damper on the whole experience.  The menu stated that there was a $5 charge for splitting.  We understood that but when the food came to the table it was not split up so we asked for another plate and I split it myself.  We thought--that's good, we won't be charged the $5 now.  Not only were we charged for the split, we were charged $3 more ($8) for it, because \"they recently raised the price\" (but didn't update the menu?).  On top of that we ordered the spaghetti Santucci which was good, but we thought the meatballs were included as one of the choices in the dish.  They added another $5 on for the meatballs too.  Our waiter got the manager when we complained.  He just apologized as did the waiter and said it was a management decision.    So--I can't recommend the restaurant due to their billing practices.",

When we got dropped off by the cab, we weren't so sure of our choice just based on the exterior of the building, and when we walked in the entrance, we were even less so. This is designed just like an old speakeasy. When you enter the door, it appears to be a dark closet with a keypad to punch in a secret code to enter. As we were puzzling over the keypad, a little hidden look-through panel popped open and the host greeted us (to our startled surprise!). He then opened a hidden door. When we stepped into the door, we walked into the 1920s!  It was amazing!  The atmosphere felt authentic with the exception of the large screen LCD where \"Good Fellas\" was playing. The walls were decorated with old gangsters and a very good singer was strolling the restaurant singing old Rat Pack songs.  The food was just as good as the atmosphere! Everything from the bread and salad, right down to the entree and dessert were delicious!  The staff was attentive while staying in role for the theme of Capo's. We highly recommend you check out this little gem off the strip of Vegas. It is well worth the trip!",

The ambiance of the restaurant cannot be beat.  I've been to the Flamingo location many times and have always loved it.  I was happy to see that the decor and general atmosphere of the restaurant was very similar.  After being seated, our server took a while to take our order, but she was super friendly.  We ordered the antipasto appetizer, which is basically a salad, but an AMAZING salad!!  It was delicious.  Only problem was that salad came with our entrees as well.  Anyway, the antipasto salad was awesome.  Then our dinner salads came, both with blue cheese dressing, and they were pretty disappointing.  They lettuce was completely swimming in dressing and I didn't have more than a couple bites.  Maybe next time I will ask for dressing on the side.  My date ordered the ravioli trafficanti, and I ordered the rigatoni with arrabiatta and a meatball.  His dish was delicious!!!  Unfortunately, we were super full already at that point from bread and salad, we only ate one of the giant ricotta stuffed raviolis.  My dish was...just ok.  It wasn't bad, but there was absolutely NO wow factor.  The meatball was not GREAT, but definitely good.  The dish just looked and tasted like something I could make at home with boxed rigatoni and Prego sauce, and throw in some chili peppers.  Voila!  Next time, I will have to remember to order something more complicated.  I would say over all, the food was a 4.  Service.  The restaurant was not that crowded, but our server seemed to be running around like she was completely swamped.  She may have checked on us only once throughout our entire meal.  Before our entrees came, we ordered wine so that we could have it with dinner, but our entrees came and we ate them and our server finally came back and said the bar was backed up and our drinks would be coming soon.  We just told her to cancel them because we were done eating!  I looked at the bar and there were 3 people sitting at it and the bartender just putting glasses away and chatting with the barback.  Then she took forever to bring us our check, and to take it after we put our credit card in it.  Overall, the service kind of sucked.  That would be a 3.  So I'd give the restaurant in general a 3.5, but since we can't, sorry Capo's, I have to round down because it definitely was not a 4-star experience.  I've always loved this restaurant because of it's unique experience with the entry way, the Sinatra-like singer, and the ambiance, but this time was mildly disappointing.  I'd go back, but not anytime soon and it won't be on the top of my list.",

The sauce needed to have the wine reduced a bit more but she used the butter with the breadsticks to even it out. The risotto sides were so rich and creamy. The creme brulee dessert was one of the best we've ever had. It was so light and fluffy.

OK, the Mafioso atmosphere was kind of cool and the entertainment was fun.  The service was so undertrained it was almost as comical as it was annoying.  Asked server (maybe battlefield-promoted busboy) about some of the wines and he said \"I don't know, I just drink Jack n' stuff\".  Didn't offer to bring someone over more knowledgeable.  Pulled menus away before we ordered, tried to pull plates away at odd times.  Just really unpolished service...not rude, just disconnected.  In any case, Caesar salad was institutional tasting.  House salad was better.  Lasagna was very tasty, although portion was small.  New York Steak was actually very good.   Overall, was satisfied based on the discounted cost.  Would have been appreciably less satisfied at full cost and there would certainly be better options at comparable cost.",

The food was quite good, I felt that my dish was lacking a bit of salt, but the drinks were generous! The ambiance was lovely, ideal for a romantic date or a nice dinner with the girls.

Next the service, Valentine's Day dinner, the joint was very busy and the waitress took pretty good care of us. Finally the food.....the prices were very reasonable, the helpings were more than adequate, and the food was awesome. I definately would recommend this restaurant to anyone with this one comment. Do not let them put you in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen. Waiters going in and out constantly and very loudly calling out that they are entering, this was a bit distracting while I was with my love for dinner.",

The decor is vintage lounge for sure & well done. The pics on the wall were entertaining ambiance as well.  The food was unfortunately disappointing. I ordered the Caesar Salad lunch & Chicago Beef. The salad dressing was very tasty but completely drenched in it. I do tend to go easy on dressing so I'd order the dressing on the side & you'll be good to go. The Chicago Beef from a place that is supposed to be Capone should excel at Chicago classics. That's why I ordered the Chicago Beef. Such a bum-mer. The sandwich one wasn't dipped in the au jus. The au jus was very salty, heavy handed rosemary & not enough beef for the cost of the lunch special even. The fries were a luke warm soggy snooze fest. Just so disappointing. The service was good, attentive & the food came out promptly. Again the ambiance was fun, fun. I didn't get to see the entertainment which may have helped with an extra star but this was lunch & based on food.",

The last 2 times I've been here I've crossed paths with her... the first time was a to go order and she ignored me for 20mins before taking my order, and then barely even acknowledged me the whole time.... the second time was today, August 6; I came in with my girlfriend for lunch because I wanted good Italian with my girlfriend. She ended up being our waitress where with only 5 tables including ours were being active and she touched everyone else and waited 25 mins before even getting our drinks and another 30 mins before taking our food order! The only things she did were the above and bring us the first drinks, never even brought refills or even our food! Just that and the check! It's ridiculous; the buss boy did everything else for us and was attentive to our needs without us asking; I can't remember his name but I remember he said he was from Germany; he deserves to be a waiter, unlike Angela! Because HE took care of us I gave him $20 for a tip and Angela $0 because she obviously didn't care. She even sat other tables down after us, took their orders and even got their food before even taking care of us.   I LOVE the food at this place but with the service I've gotten from her it makes me less wanting to come back and spend my hard earned money here. To your management who hopefully reads this; you need to make sure your waiters and waitresses in check, outside of the guy who DID help us the service was worse than I've gotten at McDonalds! And you guys aren't on the cheap side. You're a fine dining authentic Italian restaurant and your staff needs to understand that and project that to your customers.",

    "text": "The ambiance in this place can't be beat if you're looking for a classic Vegas speakeasy-type of old-world Italian charm. The food - as long as you stick to what they do best - is pretty darn good too, making this place worth the trip up Sahara.  The service was really spot-on too.  We had early 5:00pm reservations on a Saturday night for six people and there were plenty of attentive staff members to attend to our every need.  There were unfortunately a few shortfalls.  One was with the Chilean Sea Bass which was a special of the evening.  Ordering seafood at an Italian restaurant with no fish at all on the menu probably isn't a good idea, and this proved to be the case here.  Luckily I wasn't the one who ordered it and the person in our group who did wasn't as familiar with the plate.  She didn't seem to mind the fishy smell and taste which ordinarily wouldn't accompany a fresh version of this dish, but the bite I had was not good.  Wasn't prepared poorly, just wasn't fresh or of high quality, particularly for the price.  Minus one star.  The rest of the food, though also somewhat pricy, was delicious.  Pasta, a signature chicken dish and even a Ribeye steak were all wonderful.  The meatball appetizer consisting of two baseball-sized meatballs in a spicy pepper sauce was a real star of the show.  Stuffed mushrooms were good too, but also a bit on the spicy side.  If you're not a lover of zing, watch for things on the menu noted as spicy - they're not lying.  For larger parties of six or more, they are supposed to include an 18% gratuity as explained on the menu.  Parties of either 8 or 10 or more (can't recall which) have a 20% gratuity tacked on.  I don't have a problem with this and it's clearly noted on the back of the menu, but it seems the staff does have a problem with it.  When our check came there was a 20% gratuity added onto it, even though we only had 6 people at the table.  To add insult to injury, they figured the 20% gratuity on the POST-TAX amount.  Those two screw-jobs added up to quite a bit since the pre-tax total was already over $300.00, so minus another star.  We were in a rush and truthfully I would have added more onto the pre-tax 18% I was expecting anyway because the service was truly fantastic, but I would have rather done so myself.  Instead, our nice meal ended with me feeling as if I'd just been screwed because they can't follow their own rules.  C'mon Capo's - do the right thing.  Figure the percentages properly and apply them appropriately to the pre-tax amount.  The extra couple of dollars isn't worth the bad taste left in the mouth of any diner paying for a party of six or more who can do basic math.    And if you're reading this and going there with a party of six or more, keep the calculator handy and make sure you're treated fairly.  Maybe it was just our server using these kinds of underhanded, deceitful methods of figuring out gratuities, but I'll never know because next time I have six or more in our party, I'll go somewhere else.",

We sat in a huuuuge oversized booth but it was so nice for just the two of us.  There was some Frank-Sinatra sounding guy crooning & singing to everyone but not in an \"in your face, I'm annoying\" type of way.  It was lovely!  Our waiter, and actually all of the staff, was great.  I think his name was Francisco.  We usually tell our waitstaff we are vegetarian from the get-go that way they don't waste their breath with the specials and he immediately made some great suggestions for us.  They have a veggie meatball they offer instead of their traditional one, we were so impressed!  My husband had the spaghetti and meatball, and I had the penne vodka...  so. damn. good.  We also shared a caesar salad and a bowl of pasta fagiole (I'm convinced no one makes it better than my Mom, but damn this place gives her a run for her money).  Pricing is very reasonable for the quality of food and the overall experience.  I didn't care for Las Vegas in general but if I ever go back, I will be returning for sure!",

I'd say this is more for adults than kids, though. Dinner prices are a bit on the high side, but they occasionally come up on Groupon.  CAPO'S HOUSE  SALAD or NICO'S CAESAR SALAD ($7): Overpriced and overdressed, they use tons of dressing, but do taste good. Opt for the garlic version on the House, splurge the extra $3 to add chicken to the Caesar. AUNTIE G'S ANTIPASTO SANDWICH ($12): Chicken breast and various antipasto meats and cheeses layered on a tasty focaccia with roasted red peppers, spinach, and a delightful lemon-pesto aioli. Side choice of pasta salad or fries, topped with additional aioli. Large portion, very fresh. SANTUCCI'S PASTA ($10): classic spaghetti with \"Capone family secret sauce\", add a giant meatball for $5 to make it a real meal. Pasta was a bit mushy but the 'ball was pretty good, BF said he'd get this again.  Food quality for lunch was probably a 3/5 but attentive service and atmosphere kicks the overall rating up to a 4 for me. Would come back in the evening for the Frank Sinatra singer, or to catch HH at the bar (3-6PM, M-Sat). They have a private dining room for larger parties.

They were totally accommodating to us including a couple of weird diet restrictions and even made special dishes without being asked. The entire staff was great, especially our waitress.  I can't imagine the person who gave the  angry sounding 1 star review below went to the same place we did.  The food was fresh and tasted great.  It's a bit of a hike if you are staying on the strip but we found it well worth it.",

    "text": "We go to Vegas often and have driven by this place a million times.  It's located across the street on Sahara Ave across from the car dealerships. I had purchased a Groupon so we could give it a try and we are very happy that we did. The Groupon offered was for 2 house salads ($6.95) that had this amazing creamy garlic dressing that we had on the side.  2 entrees and we had the meatball sandwich ($9.95) with a choice of pasta salad or fries. I had the pasta and it wS delicious with marinated artichokes. The sandwich was not bad. The meatball had good flavor but was a bit tough.  My husband had the Capone's carbonara ($10.95) that was delicious!  It came with 2 beverages. He had coffee and I had iced tea and both were good.  The service was great. The waitress was warm and friendly and so was the busboy.  It had an old school mobster vibe with red leather booths and a piano that they said they have entertainment at night.  We really enjoyed it. We are going to try it for dinner next time.  Sorry we don't have pictures my phone died when we sat down.",

He was looking for something special because I had just gotten a promotion at work. So he found you..made reservations and we went. We loved the entire experience we had. The ambiance, the service and the food!!!  Must try the Meatball...so good...I am not a huge fan of meatballs but this one was said to be the best and it was. The names of dishes are quite funny...I had swimming with the fishes...a great shrimp pasta meal...which you could tell the pasta was homemade! My fiance had Lasagna which was so big he couldn't finish it...he said it was the best he ever had. The Sauce was delicious. Probably the best sauce I've had in a restaurant. Now for the service... better than 5 stars both times we have been! Never were our drinks empty, very friendly, very attentive. The 2nd time we came we had told another local couple that are friends of ours to come with us. They had said that they wanted Italian food...so we said we have to go here...we sat in the main dining room this time, had a magician who was amazingly funny and had us stumped on how he was doing his tricks, the lounge performer really set the mood for old school vegas, and once again, food and service did not disappoint.  This is truly an experience not to be missed!!! We will definitely be going back again and again!",

I called to make sure we wouldn't be turned away and the mobster that answered replied with a heavily Italian, \"Gimme a name...\"  We arrived on a Thursday for lunch. We found the secret entrance, gave the eyes in the doorway the code and were granted admission. The entire place is dimly lit and mob like. Red lights flash to alert them of new visitors and creaky wood floors keep people honest. We were seated right away, in a comfy booth adorned with a portrait of Al Capone.   All the waiters wear white pressed long sleeve shirts and black trousers with suspenders. I selected the meatball sandwich, which came with a side salad. The sandwich was amazing. The best Italian I have ever had in my life. The creamy garlic dressing is so good, you will wish you could take a bottle home with you. From the drink list, I chose \"Kick in the Head\". We visited a nearby tiki bar a bit later and let me tell you -Capo's crafts a much better cocktail. It was delicious and carried just the right punch.   My man selected the chipped Italian beef sandwich and again, we were blown away. It's as if they have taken good home cooking and elevated it to off the charts good. Their Chianti selection is also excellent. Service was great.   We were there too early in the day for the piano player. I am already planning a return dinner trip, so that we can experience that. I have heard nothing but great things about him.",

    "text": "\"Who knew that, after 30 years, I'd find my favorite Italian restaurant on a random street corner in Las Vegas.\"  My friend actually said that, and he was only kind of joking.  I based my first trip to Capo's on its Yelp star rating alone, and I am really glad I did so.  Had I actually read any reviews (which I did later, after eating a very satisfying meal and no longer wishing to devour the phone from which I was Yelping), my experience would not have been as cool.  I took my friend to Capo's last night, and I didn't tell him anything about it, other than to let him know that I really like the food.  From the moment the little window-hole opened in the entry-way, he had a smile on his face.  Capo's really knows how to deliver on ambience.  Everything from the decor to the dark to the hard New York Italian accents on the waiters screams Goodfellas.  I can't imagine anyone not liking the environment here.  The food is really good as well.  Be warned that the chef at Capo's LOVES garlic.  It is in absolutely everything, in copious amounts, and it is delicious.  Don't miss the Mafioso Caprese from the \"Temptations\" list.  As for entrees, I have tried Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata, Vinny's Ala Vodka, and a Cioppino that was offered one night as a special.  Everything was great and garlic-laden.  If you want to speak to anyone after you eat at Capo's, make sure that you take them with you.  If you order Uncle Pauly's, make sure that you feed them some.  I'm being absolutely serious here.  Be prepared to leave extremely full.  Bread, butter, and Parmesan cheese arrive the moment you sit down.  Go ahead and try to resist bread that is still steaming from the oven.  They'll bring your temptation order before they bring the soup or salad that comes with your meal.  You'll love whatever you get.  Then your soup (try the Pasta Faggioli) or salad (Ceasar!) will arrive.  About halfway through that, you'll remember that you have an entree coming, but you won't be able to stop.  If you order a pasta entree, the sauce will be among the most amazing things you've ever tried, so you'll definitely need to take home your leftovers.  As you might imagine, I have never gotten around to dessert.  It's good to have a goal for next time.",

I wish it was served hot! Also, $20 spaghetti and meatballs featured one meatball. IT SAYS MEATBALLS ON THE MENU. And I have never seen a smaller portion of lasagna. As I mentioned, could have overlooked the small pricey portions if they food was served hot, or at least warm. I will not return here, totally not worth it. And the live singer was just awful. What a tourist trap!",

The live entertainer was great, he even sang a song we requested!  Service was amazing. Our glasses of water and wine never went below 1/2 full. We ordered the bruschetta (above average) as an appetizer. The house bread basket with garlic butter was yummy too. For entrees, he had the shrimp scampi and I had the Chicken Angelo. Both were amazing! I had the house italian salad and he had the caesar...very good as well.   For dessert we got the Italian coffee with amaretto...HIGHLIGHT of the meal by far! My pinot noir was fantastic too.  Overall, the experience was phenomenal and I would recommend the restaurant to anyone any day. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the heat. We were sitting by an AC monitor that read the current temperature at 86 degrees. It was a little uncomfortable even for small people who love being in the warm outdoors! If the restaurant steps up their AC offering, they will be 5 stars for sure! Otherwise, I'll be back when the weather cools down ;)",

    "text": "Sandwiches are good.  However, the choice of the two sides available leaves much to be desired.  With the sandwiches, which were all about $10, one side is offered from only two selections....pasta salad or fries.  No choices of substitution are allowed; someone in our group with dietary restrictions asked if she could substitute anything else....broccoli, a side salad, cottage cheese, coleslaw.  No substitutions are available.  She was told she could just not get the side if she wanted.  Same price.  The pasta salad was awful, as were the fries.  The fries come with some kind of weird sauce on them.....a mayonnaise based sauce that wrecked the fries.  One person ordered the fries without the sauce.  They were average at best. I feel this restaurant should expand the selection of the two sides that no one in our group of 5 liked at all. The house salad was basically lettuce that was not good.  There were a few microscopic pieces of tomato...not bigger than 1/2 of a square centimeter.  With so many choices in Las Vegas, Capo's needs to serve better side dishes.",

I should have turned around and left when they pulled the door stunt, but I didn't.  Watch your step as you enter too.  This place is so dark you need a flash light to see anything.  Again, I shoulda ran.  Finally got seated and was greated by a server that was gorgeous but i'm am sure was mentally challenged.  Wonder how she got the job?  Because it was too dark to see the menus, my companion asked her if he could have vodka sauce in his capellini (not my choice but hey.....).   She had no idea what vodka sauce was and didn't know capellini was a pasta.  Finally, after a very painful experience trying to order our food came.  It was ok but I couldn't wait to get out of there.",

You can't go wrong with Grade-A Italian food and a friendly guy in a suit singing Frank Sinatra!  My only food-specific recommendation is the bruschetta appetizer. It's a must-order, and I could easily make an entire meal out of it.  Two final thoughts...warnings, really.  1) Yes, it's dark inside. It's very dimly lit, but I personally felt it added to the ambiance.  2) You're going to overeat on this amazing food and need to roll yourself out the door!",

Don't get me wrong, he was fantastic, but we couldn't carry on a conversation until we had to move into another room. We started out with some great apps.  The fried ravioli, meatballs and the \"off the menu\" leftovers dish that our waitress (Janine) cut into 8 portions since it is normally served as a healthy sized entree.  It was fantastic.  The fried ravioli was pretty good, but would have preferred a meat filling vs. ricotta cheese.  The meatballs were as good as they get.  Everyone commented for days about how good they were. My wife kept it light and just got a chicken Caesar salad and loved it.  I had the veal parmesan and loved it.  Everyone was so impressed with each of their entrees, we were sharing bites from across the table for an hour. Our entire group is from Chicago and an Al Capone Speakeasy was of interest to all of us.  We know our Italian food and I've been traveling to Vegas for nearly 40 years and had some of the best Italian food in the world while visiting there.  We've been to dozens of places including Piero's and have to say this meal was as good as it gets in that town, if not better in many ways including very fair prices.  It was only a 15 minute ride from the strip and we WILL be going back. Janine (our waitress), if you're reading this, thank you for the superior service.  You really made the evening that much more special for us.",

The staff was overall friendly and they even had a guy singing a few songs throughout the night. There were four of us and everyone really enjoyed their meals. \"The Gallows With Clams\" - had been craving fresh pasta with some red clam sauce for a long time and this absolutely satisfied that craving. A bit pricey at $23 but it was a nice size portion with a good amount of clams. (similar dish at Maggianos which is on the strip is only $16) \"Mad Dog Marsala\" w/Chicken + mushroom risotto - Kacey ordered and enjoyed but way, way, way overpriced at $28. The meal is listed at $24 and the waitress listed off the sides available. However she failed to mention that the risotto was going to add another $4 as a substitute. Way overpriced for one piece of chicken and a little side of risotto. \"The Mob's Meatball Salad\" - friend that ordered it loved it. I tried Meatball and it was delicious. \"Capo's Lasagna\" - friend loved it.  Be careful if you order drinks as they are pricey and add up quick.",

We made our way to the bar and ordered a couple of drinks that were well made and just strong enough.  The ambience was evocative of what I think a \"speakeasy\" would have  been in the 20s or 30s.  There are pictures on the walls of various notorious pre-WWII gangsters.  There was a gentleman performing karaoke to classic Sinatra, Martin, Bennett and other crooners.  He was, for the most part, right on.    Eventually, we made our way to a booth to eat.  In our group we ordered Veal, salmon, lasagna and arrabiata pasta.  We started with an appetizer of caprese which was very good.  A large section of mozzarella, thick slice of tomato and a good dose of balsamic vinegar.  I would have preferred more basil, but I'm really partial to basil.  Our meals were delicious.  The protions were good, but not overwhelming.  With our appetizer, bread, and soup or salad before the meal there was enough to take home after eating sensibly.    The server was attentive without being overbearing.  Our waters were consistently refilled without request.  All in all a great evening of food, service and ambience.  I look forward to going back.",

    "text": "Easily my favorite casual dining restaurant in Las Vegas!   This place came highly recommended from a colleague, someone I didn't trust much, but she raved about the secret entrance, wonderful atmosphere and fantastic food and she looked like she knew a thing or two about food (if you know what I mean).   My fiance and I decided to check it out on one of our date nights and were immediately confused as to which entrance to go through, the (free) valet kid helped us out, it's all part of the atmosphere. Why they have valet, I'll never understand, especially since the restaurant is the only thing occupying a majority of spaces in this small shopping center.   Once inside, we were rudely asked, \"Can I help you?\" by a pair of eyes peaking through a secret sliding peep hole. Nervously, we told him of our reservation and to our enjoyment he opened the \"secret\" door, revealing a dark, noisy bar, chalk outlines on the floor, dim lighting, ornate chandeliers and wallpaper. A cheesy piano man was hitting the keys and singing Bobby Darin, a tip jar was perched at the edge of his mini grand while old mob movies played on flat screen TVs. Immediately, we fell in love with the place and still hadn't seen a menu.   Anyone who knocks the atmosphere must be crazy, or simply prefers a quiet, intimate restaurant. Don't get me wrong, those kinds of places are fun, too, but this place is noisy, dark and heavily themed, I can't stress that enough and this is coming from someone who hates Rain Forest Cafe because of the atmosphere and theme.  Our waiter was wonderful, he had a thick Italian accent, I believe fake, but still hilarious and he told us about the menu and gave us time to look over the menu after taking our drink orders. Cocktails are a bit expensive, but there aren't many quality bars in Vegas that serve cheap cocktails, so the price was mostly forgiven.   We each ordered a pasta dish, her the Lasagna and me the \"Angels with Dirty Faces,\" which is a bit heavy, but for a pepperoni fan like me, was extremely flavorful and delicious. Now, let me be honest about the food, this is in no way the best food in Las Vegas (so far, that belongs to Carne Vino at Palazzo, but that's another Yelp). This place is wonderful for its combination of theme, atmosphere and food, not one thing or the other. Remember Chuck E. Cheese's when you were a kid? That karma of arcade games, ball pit and mediocre pizza? Remember how fun that was? Now, improve the pizza, replace arcade games and ball pit with atmosphere and cocktails and you've got the kind of harmonious perfection that makes Capos such a fun, memorable place.   We've been here too many times to count and bring our out-of-town friends all the time and they love it. We've never had a bad experience.   Please give this place a try, if you're not a food snob, you will love it.",

The service was impeccable and the food was amazing! He had lasagna and I had chicken marsala with a side of mushroom risotto. The chicken was so tender I barely needed a butter knife. Everything was wonderful and the dark restaurant with the half moon red leather booths with the chandeliers above them really set a romantic mood.

    "text": "Are you freakin' kidding me?  Being a regular, I can say that this is, hands & feet down one of the coolest Vegas flair restaurants, unique in its kind & kick a$$ at the same time.  Capo's is the only speakeasy in Las Vegas.  Call for reservations & prepare to go back in time when Alphonse Gabriel aka: \"Al\" Capone hung out in an underground bar during the prohibition era of the 1920's & 1930's.  Food is pretty decent for Italian cuisine, not the best I've ever had.  But you don't necessarily go to Capo's for the food, ha, you go for the environment.  Most servers come fully equipped with some sort of East Coast accent.  But provide attentive and hospitable service.  Most nights a live lounge singer will serenade you table-side to good ole favs from Ol' Blue Eyes.  Don't make direct eye-contact if you don't want him to embarrass the sheeze outta ya.  Once he sang me, \"that ladies a tramp\" ha, thanks!   Corner location, not many people know of this little treasure, good for me, I bring all my out of town guests here.  They eat it up.  The decor is awesome, dimly lite & romantic-ish, and the bar almost always plays the movie Godfather.....or a mafia gangster movie.  There's also a hidden cigar bar upstairs, ask your server for details. It's super small & quite ventilation retard, but cool nonetheless.  GO, go at least once a week!",

    "text": "My family and I, from Brooklyn, NYC, enjoyed a delicious and authentic Italian dinner at Capo's last night. This is the ONLY restaurant in Vegas where you will find the most delicious Italian specialties, like eating at Gramma's, for a very affordable price. Their meatballs rival Rao's and come out on top without a doubt. The macaroni dishes are overflowing and are topped with the most delicious specialty gravies.   Not to mention, the very refreshing, old world speak-easy charm, very efficient staff (with pleasant personalities), and the entertainment truly is a time machine back to the Sinatra days that make this whole dining experience a worthwhile destination to say the least.  So put this one on the top five list, and enjoy a unique dining experience. Bobby Liguori, the Frank Sinatra - of the night, should not be missed!  His performance is Sinatra - close your eyes and let his voice  take you back.  He is a Brooklyn boy as well!!  He performs on the weekends only and he definitely the frosting on top of this mouthwatering cake! Try Capo's - YOU WILL NOT REGRET THE TRIP!",

Im sorry to say that I did not enjoy the vegetarian options.  We ordered the caprese salad and the eggplant parmigiana. The caprese salad was ok.... but it was drenched in an overpowering pesto. Pricey! $15!!!  The eggplant parm ($21!!!) came out soggy and oily. Way too much cheese! The best thing about the dish was it came with a side of grilled asparagus. All 3 of us at the table agreed that the plain asparagus was the most appetizing.  My friend ordered the vodka pasta and the other just plain marinara pasta. They were not impressed either.  Too bad... Too expensive. Im sad I wont be back since I really liked the vibe of the place.",

The atmosphere is terrific, complete with a live singer who comes right up to each table and serenades each and every woman.  Dim lighting also adds to the romance factor, though it's a little hard to gauge since we were there with a large group.  It does seem like the kind of place that would make a terrific date, though.  The food was delicious, and because we ordered family style I had the chance to try a bunch of different dishes.  The desserts were especially tasty, and I was surprised to find that the chocolate cake was by far the best (over the cheesecake and canoles, usually my favorites!).",

There is the occasional magician or lady selling roses too.   The service follows the old speakeasy feel. Reservations are recommended, otherwise try to grab a seat at the bar (which can be hard to come by). When you call to make a reservation you'll get an abrupt \"yeah, \" making it feel like you're part of a secret Italian meeting. You'll get the same \"what do you want attitude\" when you come in the front door. It's all part of the appeal to the restaurant. Once you get your table, the servers are attentive & the food arrives in a timely fashion. There is a view of the kitchen from some of the seating at the bar and booths. Further inside, you get a view of the Sinatra-like performer. There's also room room for larger parties.   The food quality here is great. I'm not a huge fan of Italian food, but everything here is really good. Ma's meatballs is two huge meatballs served with sauce and peppers that add a nice spice. The lasagna portion is gigantic & my fave. The chicken parmigiana and chicken Marsala are tasty traditional choices, but I would recommend trying something more original like the chicken Anastasia. For dessert the turtle cheesecake hits the spot.   The prices are $20-$30 for dinner, but the portions are huge so you'll likely have leftovers. If you get an appetizer, consider sharing an entree. They also have 2for1 Tuesdays to offset cost. I haven't been for lunch, but it looks like you can get a sandwich for $10, so not bad. I'd like to try the meatball sandwich someday!",

    "text": "Not worth the hype. It's kinda cute how they stick to the mob/speakeasy vibe. Also the staff is very kind. That's where the positives end, unfortunately.   The decor is old school, but not in a good way. Instead of looking like a place that was inspired by decades past, it just looks like the decor hasn't been updated in decades.   The food is nothing to write home about, especially for the price. I started with the \"bust a cap\" stuffed mushrooms, and was not impressed. I was expecting to have my mind blown, but was instantly disappointed instead. Bland and flavorless from the first bite. For my main course, I had a \"chef sleeps with the fishes\". This was better without a doubt, but still only slightly above average.   I felt gypped. I honestly could have had better \"Italian\" food at an Olive Garden for less than half the price. Or, alternatively, I could have gotten far superior Italian food on the Strip for a similar price point.   Also, I think it's worth mentioning that they charge $8 to split a dish. No extra soup, no extra salad and the exact same serving size for a single person. Just an $8 up charge to split something. That was super disappointing, because my boyfriend and I almost always split an appetizer and a main course wherever we go. Restaurant portions are huge, we don't ever end up eating leftovers and it's cheaper, so it just makes sense. So to be charged an additional $8 and receive nothing extra return is kinda ridiculous.  I don't ever see myself returning.",

    "text": "Great experience. We went in the secret back door, it's a fun experience if you have the password which you can get from their website. It has a fun mob/mafia vibe to it. It is reminiscent of old Vegas, with the low lights and booth seating. The also have tables that easily pull out. If you have a mobility concern or visual concern, use the front door, they are very accommodating. There aren't any steps you need to worry about. The wait staff was very nice, good recommendations. The food was excellent, we tried the calamari, meatballs, penne vodka and cannolis, all of it fantastic. The only irritating thing was toward the end, some lady started yelling loudly about not getting her way. I guess she used the Groupon for 4 people, but she was the only one there so the staff were explaining to her that it's for 4 people. I know about her problems because she was shouting swear words 3 feet from the back of my head. But other than her, it was a great experience! Take the family!",

I don't think people understand the act, and if they don't, fuggedaboutit.  The maitre de played his party superbly. They actually set up a table for us in front of the piano a'la Good Fellas, like they put it into place as we were walking to it.   Our waiter, Brandon played the part and his suggestions on drinks did not disappoint. Blood orange martini... Nuff said. Bust a cap appetizer was incredible. Couldn't decide between Fredos Alfredo (I love Alfredo) or the Gottis chicken Angelo. Brandon said it comes with a side of pasta, I can have em do an Alfredo for you. That is a stand up guy...  Kevin, the singer, set the mood, asked us for any requests and didn't disappoint. Really appreciate the interaction a made the whole experience. The people who said the food was not good, no flavor either have this place confused or wouldn't know good food if it introduced itself. The food was BOMB! The sauce on the Gottis chicken Angelo...omg! Rest of the family was equally satisfied. We couldn't eat any more, got cannolis to go, Brandon hooked it up. The entire staff was great, attentive and played the part. Made our evening! I would drive to Vegas from Cali every weekend just to eat here. We come to Vegas a few times a year and this is definitely on our list EVERY trip. To the owner and staff, you are all Aces in our book!",

    "text": "I absolutely can't say enough good things about this place. Warning... Spoilers ahead so if you're here to just figure out if you should go, just go. If you love Italian, go. Go now. Don't wait.  Alight - so when you walk in, you're met with a closed room and a note to ring the buzzer. You do so and are surprised by someone opening a small door and getting kind of rough with you (words). I won't reveal more secrets but that should set the tone well enough.   You walk in and they have a crooner serenading the crowd and he's good. He sounds like a classic. The whole ambiance gives off this vibe of an Italian mob speakeasy. The staff is in on it, but it's never over the top or too gimmicky.   We sat at the bar because we didn't have a reservation, but that was the best spot. You get to watch the super focused cooks and chef run though orders with extreme focus and precision. A great spot for someone to gain insight into the dance and acrobatics that comes with the art of preparing food.  Then the meal came. The pasta fagioli was superb. Freshly prepared and just as light and balanced as it is supposed to be.  I ordered Uncle Pauly's arrabbiata (sans protein) and it was AMAZING! The heat, the garlic, and that authentic sauce was a wonderful balance. The penne was cooked a perfect al dante. Seriously, so many places get it too soft, but these pros know how to do it.   If you hit up Vegas, make this a must-do. Totally worth the price.",

We ordered the Bust-A-Cap appetizer which is mushroom caps stuff with ham and cheese. For the entrees, our food came with a choice of soup or salad, now on the menu it says no additional charge for the salad, my only discrepancy is that they charged an additional $2 for the salad on my bill for some reason, but my date enjoyed it very much so I didn't complain about it, just wish I knew why they snuck that charge in there. I ordered the Santucci's Pasta, spaghetti noodles in homemade pasta sauce and homemade meatball which was massive and very tasty even the sauce was really good compared to the store bought stuff. My date ordered the lasagna which was a HUGE chunk in a bowl and she enjoyed it immensely but needed a to-go box to take 3/4 of it home. Overall the experience was great but the only thing i'll have to keep an eye on next time is the reason there is a unsuspecting surcharge to the salad that says on the menu that it comes with the entree.",

The floor must be made of wood because every time someone walked behind me the floor flexed and my chair moved up and down. There was 3 feet between my chair and the chair at the next table but somehow every time a staff member walked by they would hit my chair which was so annoying.  The service was generally good, but the man handing out menus reached around in front of my face to hand out the next menu and had the menu inches away from my face. Two of our party ordered the same dish but only one came out of the kitchen. It was a full 5 minutes before the other entre came out. My last complaint is about cleanliness of the mens rest room. Behind the sink faucet there was a large amount of scum and buildup. It makes me wonder what the rest of the place looks like with the lights on.",

Kinda neat.  Nico's Caesar salad was very good, I like the way the lettuce is cut really thin. I had Capone's Carbonara with chicken. For me, this isn't Carbonara. Too wet and I have to say, bland. Wife had Santucci's pasta. This was pretty good, sauce taste fresh and homemade. Had to ask for parmesan cheese. Been nice if it was fresh at the table. Also had garlic cheese bread, good but I couldn't taste garlic. Overall, I'll give it another try but I'll probably stay conventional, pasta and a meat ball.",

We walked in and it was pretty dark but I noticed the beautiful chandeliers and the live Frank Sinatra music.  Oh I love this place already.  I am a young person with an old soul so I like this kind of shit.  We got seated promptly and ordered our meal from the brunch menu.  I had the steak & eggs, husband got the egg frittata and my mom got the traditional spaghetti with meatballs.  I also ordered a Bloody Mary - to complete the appeal.  Enjoyed my food and devoured all of it.  Husband loved his frittata.  Our server Kate was very accommodating.  We wanted our eggs cooked in real butter instead of oil and she said no problem.  My husband spilled his baileys for his Irish coffee and they replaced it promptly.  I have no complaints.  The next come to Vegas with my friends, this is going to be our first stop.  If you haven't been, check this place out so you know how glamorous old Vegas was.  I love this place.  Oh did I say that already?!",

    "text": "Making a memory with a meal is all what its cracked up to be.  Friday night was the second time I had been to this place and it was just as great as I remember.  I scored a groupon $60 for $30 and decided to take some friends who were Capo-virgins.  I do recommend reservations as it does book up.  It took us a few minutes to find the door as it kind of gives you an \"alley way\" entrance to the place.  This is the first time at this location and I actually thought it was more amazing than the last one (on Trop) that I had been to.  Upon entry there is a little mobster suprise experience that you just have to see for yourself.  I don't want to spoil the fun even though I have seen others spill the beans reviews on here. Once you find yourself in the joint, and you are shown your table you will find yourself thinking what century am I in??  The place is dimly lit.  Probably the darkest restaurant I have ever been to but ya know its all about the secretive down low. lol  As we were seated, the 1970s round red leather booths are to die for (but don't say that out loud) along with velvet wallpaper and these amazing chandelliers above the tables....loved them!  They hand you the menus which accompany a little flash light so you can actually see it.  Nice idea.  For our meal I ordered the Stuffed Chicken Anastasia-lightly breaded and stuffed with ricotta and spinach.  The menu says its topped with pink sauce but it was topped with red sauce and a dab of pink sauce.  I just ordered some more pink sauce and I was good to go.  It came with some angel hair pasta with red sauce.  It was alooot of food to eat but it was so good.  I shared with the table some of the chicken.  I just couldnt eat even half of it.  The BF ordered the Capones Cabanara and he devoured that.  I'm not a fan of peas so I only tried a small bite but it was great.  My friend ordered the spaghetti with meatball (and it was huge).  She said the meatball was full of flavor and the best she ever had.  Her husband ordered the Mad Dog Marsala....which seemed not so big of a plate full but he loved every bite. On a side note I must say that this isnt the \"best\" Italian we've had but it was good and the experience makes it great!  The wine, bread and salads were a perfect addition.  We all ordered 2 drinks and our drinks were at least half the bill.   No joke.  Thanks for the drinks Groupon! haha  Actually I think the drinks were more than the Groupon but who is counting.  The service was awsome-very attentive and friendly with a Italian mobster edge. lol  Don't forget about the live music \"thats amore\".  Very special touch!  I must say I highly recommend this place.  It is very romantic-great for a date, fun to take some peeps to, and just to stop by and have a drink with the pin striped suits.  My friends loved the experience and the food so a good pat on the back to us for taking them.  Now who can I take next? ;)",

    "text": "HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!    DO NOT GO! -  First had to flag someone down for drink order and then later someone else to get our waitress to FINALLY take our food order. The busser (who was too new to be on his own) actually went twice to the bar to get my parents a new beverage because our waitress was lost again.   Two out of four food dishes were INCORRECT. When we attempted to let her know the mistakes she argued with us, saying the items didnt come with what we thought they did. Since I STILL HAD A MENU I pointed out that we were right. So, she says to my mom she must have grabbed the wrong plate but tells my bf  \"oh we don't serve mashed potatoes with the $40 steak anymore cause no one likes them\". Ummm something she failed to mention when he placed the order and, also, NOT what the menu said, to which I proved, again, SINCE I HAD A MENU STILL.  She leaves with my mothers dish to replace the incorrect pasta with the roasted potatoes and brings back the same plate with the pasta still on it, and half a spoonful of what the side should have originally been!!???    Let me also not forget to mention the stacked dishes on the edge of the crumb filled table that neither her or the busser ever picked up yet we stacked to make room for our dinner. Let me also point out that my mother, father and I SHARED two butter knifes for our meals.   Our waitress FINALLY checked on us after we had been sitting with nothing in front of us for quite some time (everything stacked on the edge of the table) and asked if we wanted dessert, which we declined. Not sure why it took her sooooo long to drop the bill, but when I finally started keeping track, two full songs by the piano player had cycled thru....again, that was AFTER I started keeping track.   When we left I almost took a picture of the table with stacked dishes, a MENU a couple empty bread plates and butter container (when we didn't even have bread since BEFORE we placed our food order.)  So, I called today to speak with the manager....... I immediately let her know I was unhappy and calling to let her know about our experience to let them rectify it instead of blasting it all over fb or yelp, which she was thankful for, then asked me to hold a moment.   Toni, (the GM) put the phone down and had a conversation with someone else on another phone...that I could hear every word of!!!!!! \"Whatcha doing? ......Oh yeah, I accidentally put myself on the schedule and working so now I'm short staffed........ Yeah, I'm hoping so and so calls me back too...... yeah, I can't believe i did either. Blah blah blah\" for almost four full minutes!!! Are you fng kidding me?   So when she gets back on the phone she goes so what happened? And I told her to hold on cause I'm really annoyed she just held that whole conversation with an upset customer on the phone waiting who could hear every word. Her response? \"She called first\"... And I said that's awesome, but you should have let her go as soon as you found out she wasn't available instead of carrying on a conversation that I could hear!!!!! That's when she told me not to tell her how to run her business.  I hung up ...  Not going to have much of a business if she treats customers like that.  So, basically  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!  The food is great (if you get the correct order) BUT THE SERVICE FROM BUSSER TO UPPER MANAGEMENT IS TERRIBLE!!!!!",

And specifically, the service at the Tropicana location (not to say the service at the Sahara location is poor or anything--have been there too, and definitely enjoyed it.  Jeanine is the gal who makes the difference at the Tropicana location...she is one of the most personable, courteous, on-the-ball servers I have ever met!    I have dined here many times, whether just with a local friend or two, a larger dinner party, or out-of-town guests.  Anyone I have introduced to the restaurant has absolutely loved it!  The dimly lit atmosphere is very relaxing, and the Italian mobster/mafia-themed decor is unique and different.    The food is delicious and the portion-sizes are generous.  I completely agree with anyone else's recommendation of the bruschetta...once you start eating it, you won't want to stop.  Just be sure you have a few breath mints with you if you are planning to go out afterwards, as the garlic in the bruschetta will definitely stick with you for a few hours. ;)  Is this the finest Italian restaurant out there? No.  But compared to other Italian restaurants in the same class (i.e. smaller, local, semi-casual, mid-priced), it is definitely among the best!",

Dinner, went into veal, chicken, and different pastas and all were fantastic and prepared perfect. Great work!!  Service: Not good. the waiter was not taking care of us. Water went empty 4 times ( they only had a small size bottle of water ) and he would not seem to think enough about bringing out 2 at a time? Hello? We were there to eat, and drink, but I had to ask for a second glass of wine, and I would usually go through at least 4 during a 2 hour dinner... not to mention the others at the table? did not offer to take any used plates or glasses and I had to wave over a busboy when the table had 2 empty water bottles, salad plates and appetizer plates. Another issue is that 3 people at the table got their salads, but mine never came. When he brought out the dinner service, I asked him to cancel my salad that never came. His response...... sure. WTF? Really?  I will for sure come back again, as I know they are capable of great service.",

The only air conditioning they had were 2 portables, which weren't doing the job.  It was very hot in the restaurant -- we were all sweaty by the time we got our food.  Uncomfortable.  I was expecting somewhat of a speakeasy experience -- didn't get it.  Except for the lighting and the entrance (you walk into a lobby then ring a bell to get seated), there were no dramatics here.  Maybe the staff was too hot to do their spiel.  Food was ok, nothing spectacular.  They claimed the lasagna was full of sausage and hamburger meat -- there was about 3 small chunks of sausage, the rest was ricotta cheese and sauce.  Not enough to have any leftovers, which I thought was cheap for the prices they charge.  Overall, it was a little below average.  I won't be back.",

We had so fun much here, the atmosphere is very authentic and the food is unmatched! Go with the theme, play along and ask for the password in advance. It's also a good idea to make reservations in advance. We will definitely come back next time. And bring our friends :)",

    "text": "Capo's? How about Crapo's.  The meatballs were disgusting. It's a giant meat-wad filled with chewy fat morsels, not tender at all, and nothing like our Italian Mother's, Grandmother's, or Father's made for us. Carrabba's has better meatballs. They weren't even completely cooked and were room temperature, borderline cold in the middle.   The ambiance is cool, and nice. The dark red lighting, the Al Capone and Frank Sinatra themes, the mob feel because of the dark speakeasy decor. That's worthy of 1 star.   But it stops at the ambiance. This place is highly highly over rated. With so many Italian restaurants and choices on and off the strip, why anyone would go here more than once is beyond me.  When you first walk in and ring a bell, you are greeted and questioned by someone through a hole in the wall. Which is cool. Then a hidden door opens which is cool. Again, the ambiance & theme is cool, you get a little hyped up...  But after all that, it's all downhill. There's no Italians working here. Call me a racist, I don't give a f**k. But I don't go for Mexican food and expect to see Asian's cooking and serving. I don't go get Chinese food and expect to see African Americans cooking and serving. I don't walk into a Soul Food restaurant and see Italians cooking and serving. Why when I walk into an Italian restaurant do I see Latino's everywhere and Asians cooking and serving? It's dumb. Maybe that's why Crapo's food is not good at all.  I spoke Italian briefly (4-5 words) to the host and the food runner and they both clearly had no idea what I was saying (hello and good evening pretty basic).  When I spoke English and ordered the Stuffed Rigatoni for dinner, I was served Raviolis 30 minutes later! Are you kidding me? The server doesn't know the difference between Rigatoni and Ravioli either? I specifically ordered Stuffed Rigatoni because it's an item not many restaurants carry. I get raviolis. Get me the hell out of here is all I was thinking. The raviolis were nothing special. Basic.  I Paid the bill and proceeded to get the hell out of this joint. But the kicker was that inside there's 2 exits. One by the Piano, and a sign by the restrooms. We passed by the piano exit because we were busy chatting unaware as we walked, only to be told by the host as we opened the door to leave by the restrooms (where we entered the restaurant), that we had to turn around and exit by the piano (despite the exit sign above, and the door we already 1/2 opened). Caught off guard by this chuckle heads demeanor and words, we actually played to his ego, turned around, and went out the \"proper\" exit. Back East in NY NJ PA, I would have laughed out loud, and told him to kiss my d**k after the negative overall experience as I peace out.   Crapo's is a Total tourist trap off the strip. Average food at best. The Italian mob theme is cool but the employees wouldn't know an Italian mobster or Italian culture if it smacked them upside the head. They open your wine with a gun bottle opener. Wow, Big deal. They can't even take your order properly. 1 star for ambiance with Al Capone and Frank Sinatra on the walls. But they need to work on their food quality, and train their staff properly about Italian cuisine.",

Came in for lunch and the meatball parm hero was excellent. Water was refilled numerous times without having to flag someone down. Excellent service.  Love this place. Looks cool. The food is awesome.  Definitely stop in if you're in town.  This comes from a True New Yorker who loves Italian, so it carries a lot of weight.",

    "text": "Wow! My coworkers took me here to celebrate my birthday and I have to say this was an awesome choice. From the secret entrance to the food and service. i was really impressed.   We arrived and went through the secret entrance. i don''t want to spoil it for future patrons, but be prepared to be surprised and be careful where you stand. The host brought us in to a very dimly lit restaurant. it took my eyes a minute to adjust. The feel inside is very old school, mobster atmosphere with the big, vinyl padded booths. Our server was a young lady with tatts and she was very impressive. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks (wine in particular). She prompted us on things like the size of the meatballs which are half a lb so be careful with how many you order. They are their famous meatballs. I didn't order it but everyone in the party that did was blown away. I had the grilled chicken carbonara and it was so scrumptious. There was no negative feedback from anyone, only praises on the food and how good it was and how big the serving was for lunch.   Our server was very attentive and so were the rest of the staff. They asked if we wanted refills as soon as they saw the glass was at halfway. We had other staff members besides our server asked how everything was and if we were ok. Now that's teamwork! I definitely have to come for dinner and try it out then.",

    "text": "While scrolling through Groupon, I noticed this restaurant that had an old school, prohibition era style restaurant. I am in love with that era (devoted my junior year project to that era) with all the organized crime, underground speakeasies, and Flapper Girls! Of course seeing this I had to purchase and am I glad I did and took my mom along with me!  On the Groupon voucher it states to call and make an appointment. When I called, the guy said not to worry for the afternoon, the evening is when it's \"really, really, really, really busy.\" I actually lost count of how many times he said \"busy.\"   \"Speakeasy\" is highly played upon. If you don't know, you will once you arrive.   After we got in, I couldn't help but notice the extremely low lighting and red booths. Red chairs lined the fully stocked bar and there was an area for live music. The place isn't that big, and I can see how they get packed so quickly. There seemed to be a really intimate room where 1 party could be seated, and another room for a large party.   Now on to the food! With the Groupon we were able to order a soft drink, salad and main entree. We both ordered the salad with the garlic sauce (I knew I'd be fighting off vampires all day, but I didn't care and ordered the garlic sauce), and Santucci's Pasta, which they are known for. First came the salad and that in itself was delicious. I don't think I've had a garlic sauce before, but it was so good. Then came the pasta. My mom and I ordered it with the meatball, mine was veggie ball, which was at an additional cost, but we wanted the full experience. The veggie ball was a soy meat with bread crumbs and herbs. The sauce is home made and was just perfect. A little sweet and covered my pasta without drowning it. My palette enjoyed the whole dish. I had to stop myself. My stomach was telling me no, but my taste buds were telling me yes. Needless to say I took some home.   I forgot our servers name, but on the receipt it says Santana. She was great! All of the people there were on top of it. When you finished, someone was there to take your plate. Drinks were never low and they always checked on you. They have a sense of humor, too which I love.   My mom kept saying she wanted to come back. I would love to as well, of course.",

They're known for the meatballs and I have to say the best meatballs, I've ever had. Definitely a must! Meatballs were moist and very flavorful and covered in signature secret sauce. Devine!! As far as our entree's my boyfriend had the lasagna which I had to taste and was delectable and delicious and I had the Seafood Cioppino which was also mouthwatering. And to top off the night we had to try the inviting dessert chocolate covered ice cream along with tiramisu which satisfied all tastebuds.  Thank you Capo's for a great experience.  WE will definitely be back agian!",

Upon arrival myself and my date provided the bartender with our industry cards to further confirm the online discount. The bartender then proceeded to entice us with the specials which by the way were incredible but neglected to tell us, very conveniently that those were not included. When the check came i asked her about it and she simply replied to me \" Oh yeah the specials are not included in industry night. Im sorry.\" so now the bill is about double it should be which is MISLEADING and UNACCEPTABLE.   At this point, as inconsolable as i was i was told by the manager that i had a $50 gift card waiting. For me in the register. And. I dont even think. I need to delve but we are happy and well fed but not not in the position to take a $200 check when it was advertised as a $100 check.

I wasn't even done with my dinner and was completely full, didn't know what to do with myself when they brought the dessert menu. I went ahead and ordered the creme brulee  and it was delicious. The prices are fair compared to other Italian restaurants and much better in my opinion. I will definitely be returning to try other dishes. There were a few negatives that caught our attention. The host was very friendly to me but never directed a word to my boyfriend. He wasn't mean or rude but he didn't seem to acknowledge his presence. I noticed this with other groups as well. Another was that they didn't have a beer list or menu. The waitress didn't really know all the available beers to choose from. The last one is in regards to space. There was a party of 8 that were seated in front of us and it was quite awkward trying to maneuver our way to the exit. We had to ask a few people to move their chair so we could get out. All minor negatives compared to the food.",

    "text": "O M G!!  Dined here last night with another couple.  My girlfriend Victoria and I were celebrating the end of our first (and last) fight.  What a great experience (Capo's, not the fight).    We had a reservation and were seated quickly after arrival, once we made past the door keeper.  That, in and of itself, is a trip!  We were given menus and water promptly.  The menus were thoughtfully provided with small flashlights to make reading them easier in the subdued lighting.  Overall the ambiance  is pleasant and the staff knowledgable, personable, and attuned to the needs of their guests.  The place does tend to get a bit noisy what with a vocalist performing and dozens of tables filled with happy diners so if you are looking for a quiet, intimate dinner you would be disappointed.  However, if you are looking for exceptional service, exceptional food, and exceptional entertainment, you won't find any better in Southern Nevada.  My girlfriend's husband had Shrimp Scampi, she had Chicken Picata with Garlic Risotto, my wife had Spaghetti with Meatball (it's a HUGE meatball), and I had Lasagna with Crumbled Meatball.  Every dish we were served was abundant and fabulous.    As for the entertainment, the vocalist is a nice touch.  He performed well and visited several tables while singing.  And the magician, well he is an absolute WOW!  He performs table side and mystifies.  I named a playing card at random (the eight of diamonds) and it magically appeared out of the deck.  He handed it to me along with a Sharpie (which we all sniffed) and I signed it.  He then proceeded to amaze us all by having the card move through the deck, apparently at his will.  He also did things with coins and table settings that had the four of us just shaking our heads in wonder.    So here is the bottom line on this place; if you are looking for a fine dining experience with peaceful, calm surroundings, pass this place by.  However, if what you are seeking is a dining experience encompassing great Italian food prepared like mama would fix it and served by attentive staff, an atmosphere where everyone is enjoying life and entertainment that by far exceeds the price paid for the meal alone, then you best get to Capo's sooner rather than later!",

He told us if we're to eat we had to be gone before 7 because it was going to be packed around that time. The service wasn't speedy but were friendly.  Now the most important part. The food. The meatball i had a lot of flavor. The gravy was meh. I love garlic but they don't know how to use it. Way too much. The garlic butter tasted of raw garlic. Especially the salad with the creamy garlic. It had that very intrusive raw garlic taste even though the waitress said it wasn't going to be like that cause they use garlic seasoning instead. The cooks need to taste the food for better seasoning.",

Highly recommend coming here if you're visiting ~ or if you're local.  This was my and my BFs first time to Vegas and to Capos. We had a great time!!  On a personal note , I would have paid someone to turn off the TVs.  We are All guilty of looking at flashing screens and it would have been perfect if when my BF and I sat at the bar he wasn't tempted to check the score (which he did... And then forgot to converse with me ). Just a preference! It seems we can't escape screens in this day and age and I was just so looking forward to a night of just his full attention haha.  Overall - when Rob and I come back to Vegas we will definitely be visiting you all again and enjoying every bit! Thank you!",

We pulled up and i instantly was not excited as the exterior is a little less than appealing in my opinion but that's what makes this place a hidden gem. We walked in and i was finally informed it was a speakeasy (i dont read reviews or look up places before i go places i like to go in open minded) we went with the  theatrics and were seated in a booth right in front of live entertainment. It was a Frank Sinatra impersonator and my did the music really set the tone. The service was pretty fast and they accepted out coupon with no hassel. I ordered the  mobsters fritata and my boyfriend the steak and eggs. The portions were more than generous and so i ended up taking a little home. We both also had a few peach belinis that were just on the mark of sweet. I really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back with some of my family.",

We sat in a private room which was really nice but kind of a bummer because we could not see the Frank Sinatra performer on stage. He made our exit by stopping into our private room and singing a little bit for us which was pretty cool. This restaurant is very dark and speakeasy. Drinks are really good and the food, even better. The meatballs are HUGE and delicious! I ordered the pesto. No one complained about their dish, only that they were full. The only thing we didn't think of was he leftovers and portions. Since we were catching a show, we were unable to take any leftovers with us which was kind of a bummer since the portions are pretty family style. I would love to take more people here to experience it. The servers were really nice and helpful to our big party.   My only negative comment is the flooring. I nearly broke my neck on the way to the private room. I hadn't even had a drink yet lol so it wasn't the booze. I was wearing very short heels and I stepped on a slippery section of wood taking me for a slip and slide. I caught myself so I didn't fall, but I skated past a table having dinner which was pretty embarrassing. My friend had the same thing happen to her but she was able to side-step it before sliding. It was just a really awkward piece of floor.  Other than that, I totally had a great time!",

    "text": "When I saw this place on a recent TV show, I knew we had to try it.  If you are into MOB movies and gangster flicks like we are, what better way to experience firsthand at something similar (well kind of) to how the Vegas MOB lived, where they dined and how they had a good time. This is not the fanciest restaurant but it's totally old school. The red leather booths, the stage for performance, the piano guy and all the attitude that comes with the people. That's their thing. Upon arriving, you knock on a door and some really cool bigh honcho looking guy opens a window like thing and says \"yea, what do you want\" in this New Yorker, heavy, mean voice. Um...we have resos at 8 please and with not okay, thanks, welcome, he opens the door and says to follow him. Again.....this is their thing. This is the image of the restaurant. In no way were we offended because I had reviewed their restaurant prior to going.   We sat down and the amazing service immediately started. Since the restaurant was very dark inside (image), they had these little cute lights hanging from their menus. The names of all their drinks and dishes were so COOL. I ordered the dirty martini (their special) and it was so delicious. My husband ordered this drink called \"kick in the head\". Ha! The waitress said \"you will see why it's called that in the morning\".   Check out their menu for all the cool names they have for their dishes.   We split the following:  Dinner salad Beef spaghetti Bolognese- off the menu  Chocolate dipped Cannoli's.   The check was VERY reasonable   Definitely going back and taking everyone I know.",

I noticed when we walked in that there was live entertainment and nice booth seating in the main dining area. We asked if we could be moved to that room and were quickly told that he spoke to mgr and those tables where reserved. hmmmm, I saw about 7 available booths!!! I asked to speak to manager. He came to our table and said he's see what he could do. He then sat us in a nice booth. Throughout the night I noticed not one other table was seated after us? Why would they lie about those booths being reserved? Weird.  The food was OK and entertainment was great.",

The service was good albeit not exceptional. Still, no complaints there.  We had the house and Caesar salads and both were good but nothing really special.  My wife had the chicken parm which she enjoyed.  My pasta was decent enough and you can tell they make it on the spot which is nice. I was disappointed with the sauce though. For all the hype I heard from the servers about it I found it to be rather boring. Too bad. They also didn't have any pasta salad available for a side dish which I found odd at a pasta place. On a positive note the meatballs themselves were delicious. It's certainly not a bad place and we may try for dinner one night and hope for a little better.",

Extremely poorly lit and that's the point so I thought that was kind of neat (especially that they were smart enough to put a little light on each menu). The food though is absolutely to die for! The waitress was super nice to me and my date and her suggestions were perfect. I've never had a meatball that amazing and those noodles were so perfectly cooked it was almost scary. They even had a Sinatra singer in there (though the music was a bit loud by him) who was actually really great. All around not a single complaint! Oh and it was 2 for 1 Tuesday so we got $20 off (that was almost my entire entree, $22)! Fantastic, just fantastic.",

    "text": "A Chicago-based mob speakeasy, in Vegas? I was so there last Saturday night for one of my very sporadic date nights with the husband. Located in the old Hooters (yeah, I'm from Vegas, I know these things), I saw that they turned that titty-tastic 80's chicken wing place into a dark, somewhat intimate but very entertaining restaurant and lounge which adorns pictures of mafia legends of long ago. Yup, this place definitely did not resemble the raucous orange splattered nipple nightmare of years before. I was impressed. We had 8:45 pm reservations and so upon entering, you must ring the bell and low and behold, the host greets you from a small cut out in the wall above the payphone, to the right of the door and doorbell. Woo, so speakeasy. And since we had those reservations, dude had no problem letting us in. Don't know if a password is required without reservations, but one need only to check their website for more info. But I think reservations would be most advisable.   Anyway, it's a good thing we had a reservation because the place was packed. We had to wait a few minutes past our reservation time. The host even admitted to us that he'd tell us to go to the bar, but considering how packed it was that night, there was no way we were getting a seat at the bar. Once we were finally seated in a booth, not far from the entrance, we waited a little bit for a server. We weren't in a hurry, we didn't have any other plans or anywhere else to be that evening, so to speak. But we were quite hungry and thirsty.   Having sorta kinda studied the menu before arriving, I chose the eggplant parm and my husband tried the lasagna. We decided against any apps that night, knowing that the entrees would be more than enough. The bread basket came and there were just 5 little slices of what looked like baguette bread with cold individual foil wrapped pads of butter. I was not really impressed with that. If you're an Italian place, offer up warm breads and butter, not this airline bread and butter service! But hey, it's always been said, best not to fill up on bread. So with that, we waited for the cocktails. And because it was a speakeasy and I knew any bar hopping that we may do that night would not offer good red wine, I opted for a dirty martini with blue cheese olives and it was fabulous! The olives were perfect apps for me. The husband had his usual fancy outing drink: a Manhattan. And although dirty martinis go better with steak, I still enjoyed my eggplant parm with my drink. My husband raved about the lasagna, especially the sauce. We each took half of our food home for the next day and it warmed up beautifully.   So I give it three stars only because of the pokey service and the bread basket. I'd like to give this place another go, possibly take my mom here so that she can check it out. I might even entertain having a steak with my dirty martini next time I visit.",

Some mixed reviews but honestly I am always up to try new things and I M sure glad I did!! First.. Read the previous reviews.  You will have a better understanding of what to expect.  Yes it is off the strip and takes about 20 mins to get there.  Google directions ppl if driving too far is a problem.  Next, the entrance is unconventional.  It is somewhat hidden and that is part of the \"theme\".  Keep in mind, everything this place does seems intentional to me.  From the stuffy host, the gimmick about being too full, all of it.  Part of why I loved it so much.  We made reservations for a Saturday night and all that was available was 9pm. My husband and I decided on a whim to go early and see if we could get in.  We got a little push back but they gave us a great seat and the rest was wonderful.  Again I wasn't offended... All part of the act.  Food was great but the meatballs were AMAZING! So glad we decided to add those on.  Great service, we were serenaded to and the food was fabulous.  Will definitely be back!",

I hate to say it but he was incredible lol. Thought he was going to be annoying but I was pleasantly surprised. The only thing I would have changed would be the chairs in the banquet room. Way to low and not very comfortable. The food? Off the charts good. I had the Chicken Anastasia and grilled veggies. SO on point.

You see, My Grandfather worked for Al Capone in the 1930's and I used to hear the stories about the numbers rackets and Speakeasies he ran and visited , so to experience Capo's homage to the old Mob Speakeasies of that era is just a treat for me.

Most good restaurants use a pivot position so when the food is delivered they know which guest gets which item without calling them out.  When they served the plates to us they just stood in one position and served the plates over the other guests.  This isn't even done at Low end places like Cheesecake Factory.  We all had to ask several times for water and iced tea refills while the servers/bussers were all standing around.  Everyone was nice but need more server training.  The magician came around and he was cool.  I eat out a lot and expect much better service when I'm spending more than $70/ a person.",

    "text": "Wow!  Went out for dinner but got more.   The food, traditional Italian, was excellent.  Our party of three had Lasagna, Chicken Parmesan, and Scaloppini and each dish was excellent.  The service was outstanding and our waiter had a pleasant personality.  The Stuffed Mushroom appetizer was also fantastic.  In addition to the great food, we were entertained by a Sinatra style singer and when he took a break the background music was out of the Bronx Tale - just fantastic atmosphere.  We were also entertained by a magician at our table while we waited for our meal.  The feel of old Vegas is here and alive.  This is a fun place with excellent food, a must visit when you have out of town guests.  My only \"ding\" would be that it is very dark in this speak-easy atmosphere so bring a flashlight.",

We went in for 2 in 1 for locals and the bill was fully charged, so I asked the girl if I need to show my ID.  She looked at it and took the bill with my credit card, but she didn't took anything off from our bill.  I said, \"I thought you explained to us if we are locals tonight, we get $20 off?\"  She said, \"Oh, my bad!\" then she went to speak to her manager.  She came back and said, \"So sorry, we can't do anything about it, but whenever you come back, we will give you $20 back.\"  I couldn't understand it because every Tuesday is 2 for 1 day for locals.  I said, \"You can't even give us $20 cash back?\"  She said, \"No, sorry!\"  We went there tonight only because they were having the deal.  Since food was amazing, we'd go back, but this doesn't make sense to me.  The manager should have came to our table and apologized, at least.  I guess since their price is not $$$$, the service is $$.",

The garlic salad dressing was perfect: not too much garlic but enough to fend off those vampires that might be lurking in Vegas at night! We will be back.",

Not too close to the band and not tucked away. I ordered the New York steak and I thought It was really good. My wife got some pasta dish that she thought was \"ok'.   The only thing that I was not pleased with is that they did not bring our bread out until the food had already arrived. The server, Brandon, took one of my drinks off of my tab because of the bread incident.  I would come back again; however, I would try to come when it is not so busy.",

I've traveled to many a destination and I have to say Capo's in Vegas is one of the great Off-Strip dinning opportunities.  I've also been here more than once so I can base this review on a long-standing patronage rather than a one-time, in passing frivolous complaint.   Food is great, reasonable for the quality, dark and secretive atmosphere, wonderful lounge style singers (that can actually sing), and if you behave as an adult aiming for a pleasurable dinning experience, this will be a perfect environment for you.  No complaints from me.",

    "text": "God, I wish I could give this place a better review! The atmosphere and the idea of it is so fun and unique and I was so excited to be going to a place featured on the show Man Finds Food. The first time I went here was 8/30/15 with a small group and I had so much fun! The Frank Sinatra singer was fun, the magician that came around to each table was entertaining and the eggplant parmesan was the best I had tried in Vegas.  WHAT WENT WRONG: Visit on 12/10/15  My parents were visiting from MI and I couldn't wait to take them to Capo's as part of an early Christmas gift. This would be my second time there. We made reservations on a Thursday night around 7:30 p.m. thinking it wouldn't be too busy. We arrived 10 mins late due to traffic and when we got there they still didn't have our table ready. The inside of the restaurant was uncomfortably hot inside and there are no windows to let in the air. We had to wait 15 mins standing by the bar because there were no seats available at the bar and I felt like I might melt from the temperature. There were a couple tables open and I'm not sure why they weren't offered to us. When they had our seats ready, we had to wait another 15 mins for our waitress Ashley to arrive. It was really strange we were waiting so long when we had reservations.   We ordered our food and I made it really clear to Ashley that my mom was vegetarian (I even told her she had been a vegetarian for 40 years) and wanted the VEGETARIAN meatball. Our entrees came and my mom started eating her food and said, \"this tastes like beef.\" I tried a bite of it and felt sick the rest of the night. We couldn't find our waitress anywhere to alert her of the mistake. My mom said, \"it really seems like we're not getting any attention at our table tonight.\" My dad ended up flagging down a busser to tell him about the mistake. The order was sent back to the kitchen and the meatball was corrected and we finally saw our waitress again. We told her about the meatball and I also had to ask for a basket of their complimentary bread because she hadn't brought any out when we were seated. By the time my mom's meatball and the bread basket arrived at the table my dad and I were finished eating and my mom had to eat alone - we didn't get to enjoy Christmas dinner together :/ I've never received a bread basket at the end of my meal before at any other restaurant. My mom also felt sick from eating the beef and we didn't get our waters refilled once. I felt awful.  The only reason I didn't give this place one star is because the guy singing the Frank Sinatra hits was attentive to us and made my mom smile. We left him a big tip. I really wouldn't recommend this place at this point. I work at a local hospital  in Vegas and I see firsthand the damage food poisoning/food allergies can wreck, plus the wait service was REALLY poor.  This place is too far from the heart of Vegas to make it worth venturing out to for the low quality and the price. I don't recommend this place to anyone any more, esp. if you're a vegetarian or have a special diet. For good, quality Italian food/better service, I recommend Ventanos. It is where I will take my parents the next time they are in town. I really regret having a Christmas dinner at Capo's.",

I'm no chef but I make chicken Marsala with more flavor and I don't think it's supposed to me almost black and I'm going to add that I got one medium size piece of chicken. The risotto was really good though. When the bill arrived I realized they gave my young son an adult spaghetti and when I asked about that he said children meals are upon request which I feel should have been asked. We have been here before a while back and was really good then but just not even close to the same I honestly would rather have gone to Maggianos.",

    "text": "We visited Capo's as a group on Valentine's day.  All in all it was amazing food.  My partner and I opted for the Valentine's lobster and steak preset menu.  It came with so many sides that I literally got scared if I could finish it.   We started off with the meatballs and fried ravioli, and I can honestly say I would eat that all day long.  I didn't need anything else.  Then out came the salad with the garlic dressing and I was in heaven.   The steak and lobster meal was great but in most cases you cant really F that up, most of the time.  I ordered the stuffed mushrooms, garlic mash, and the risotto.  I will say the highlight of the meal was the side of risotto.  I was absolutely stuffed by the time I got to the side of risotto and I couldn't stop once I had a taste of it.    The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because I had to ask for water 5 times.  Not 5 different occasions, but 5 times until my glass was actually filled.  It may seem petty but with as many amazing flavors as Capo's has going on water was needed throughout the whole meal.  Also with the preset there was a glass of wine or champagne that was never brought to our table.    I will come back again regardless, the food and atmosphere was great!",

    "text": "Very unpleasant experience at Capo's today.  Decided to try them out and bought a lunch Groupon, which stays that it's good for 11am to 3pm.  Gathered my small family and two tiny kids and got there about 2:50 pm (still before 3pm obviously).  By the time they answered the door bell and got us in and were ready to take our order it was about 2:58 pm.  Once we showed our Groupon, the server basically turned as away.  His argument - we can not accommodate you because it is too late (and that's when the restaurant was almost completely empty  - only one small table occupied! ).      When I argued  - well it's not even 3pm yet and I cam here with two little kids and the 3 year old was very excited about going to this restaurant, his response was:  nothing I can do, we stop serving lunch at 2:45pm even though our papers may say 3pm.  And, then, he just showed us the door we used to come in and said, \"you can use that door to come back out\".  So, that's how we were \"customer-handled\".     We were certainly absolutely dismayed and just left.    I have my own small businesses and certainly make sure that my employees go out of their way to accommodate our customers regardless of when they come and where they come from!",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Capo's Italian Cuisine.  Two stars is all I can come up with for this place.  Somethings are on me.  Like not really mapping out how far this place was from mid-strip.  We paid $27.50 + a $5.00 tip for a taxi from the Monte Carlo.  So figure you're into roughly a $65.00 round trip cab fare just to get here and back to your hotel.  That was on me.  It was 100 degrees outside in the early evening.  The secret door was kinda of fun.  We gave the password to my GF's daughter to get us in.  First impression, it's hot in here.  77 degrees inside.  The host seats us at the first booth we come to in the bar area facing the bar, a TV showing the The Shawshank Redemption, and the open kitchen.  Heat from the kitchen is coming right at us.  Not good.  I got up and asked the host now sitting at the bar if we can be seated in the main dinning room which is pretty much empty.  One booth out of five is occupied.  There's a big table set in the middle for maybe a party of ten?  I don't know.  The host says- Well, you know here's the thing........we have a big party coming in and....we gotta lot of reservations.....and let me see what I can do....and I'm not to sure.....and let me check on something.....and so on and so on.   My inner monolog is saying to me- This guy wants me to break out some cash for a better table in this empty hot and stuffy restaurant.  Are you fucking kidding me guy?  I just shelled out over $30.00 bucks just to get here!  Really?  I'll stand my ground.  The host continues- Yeah, you know we got this big party coming in and we are really busy and, and, and.........Okay, okay, okay, I'll get a booth setup for you.    For the record, only one other couple came in while we were there and the big table got broken down and put away half way through our dinner cause no one ever showed up.  Now, I have no real proof he was shaking me down, but I think he was.  Not cool.    We got the temp down to 72 degrees and things were looking up.  Martini time.  I had two and they were good.  Our waitress was very nice to us.  Oh yeah, as others have mentioned it's pitch black in here.  99 Cent store mini flashlights that weren't working very well are attached to the menus.  It was a struggle reading the menu.  Food-  Fried Calamari- Not bad.  No tentacles.  Boo.  Me- Salad- Over dressed and limp.   Veal Parmesan-  Surprisingly good.  I always give credit when due. Pasta- Under cooked.  Queen of Reseda's Daughter- Soup- Bland. Racketeers Ravioli- She liked it.  Queen of Reseda- Soup- Bland. Veal Marsala- Chewy, she did not like. Pasta- Under cooked.  Entertainment- The live Frank Sinatra type singer was cool at first.  The Queen of Reseda's daughter was the only single looking female in the place as far as I could see.   He serenaded her once, she liked it.  \"Return to me.  Please come back bella mia\" He serenaded her twice, okay fine.  Move on Broheim.  He serenaded her a third time and it started to get really old, really fast.   We laughed about it later, but it was borderline uncomfortable for a while there.  After dinner we asked if they would call us a cab.  They have there own driver which they offered to take us back to our hotel.  It was a flat $25.00 plus I gave him a $5.00 tip.  We took them up on their offer, the driver was very nice and got us home safe.   IMO these guys have figured out how to stack the deck with the Yelp reviews.  Soon after I posted this review, four new five star reviews mushroom up pushing this one down.  Take notice how most of these reviews are pretty short and sweet by people with not a lot of friends.    Some guy wrote how it was packed on a Monday night?  BS.  We were there on a Sunday night and it was dead.  I wish I would have checked out the 166 other reviews that are not currently recommended before coming here.  166!  Check them out for some very interesting reading.    I regret coming here.  I felt like I wasted a dinner in Vegas.  You'd be better off at Casa di Amore.  We had a great time earlier this year.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/casa-di-amore-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/casa-di-amo...</a>",

    "text": "My favorite experience our whole week in Las Vegas! Make reservations! We had to wait a few days to go as we didnt have reservations the first night we had available to go, but very glad we had another opportunity. Love the concept of the speakeasy restaurant, starting as you enter the door and the host opens his special window, plays his role well and of course the ladies with me enjoyed the compliments. We were a little late for our reservation so had to wait about 15 minutes but enjoyed watching the interactions of the host and bar staff with other customers while waiting. The Chicago mobster decor was probably my wife's favorite as they are originally from Chicago and Italian, nough said. The Italian cuisine is excellent. I had veal parmesan & opted for the upgraded sides of mushroom risotto which was wonderful and the Italian egg drop soup which is now my favorite. Wife had the spaghetti and meatballs, we both think they were the best meatballs in Vegas!That compliment after having eaten at Lavo, Batista's,  Bucca, no name, and a few other much more expensive places.  Enjoyed  the great cocktails before and after dinner and the deserts were the perfect ending.  They also had a live singer / old school Vegas crooner who did all the old rat pack songs and was very enjoyable.  One thing I noticed and appreciated was that several of the staff and customers greeted each other with the typical Italian family hand shake hug and kiss on the cheek. Just adding that extra family touch to the place. We will definitely be back everytime we are in Vegas.",

(Others include Piero's, Bootlegger, Hugo's Cellar - all of which I also provided a review of!) Thus Capo's charm makes it a not-to-miss restaurant. The service is stellar every time and you just can't beat the decor combined with the live music playing Sinatra . The food receives 3 stars from me because I'm a total foodie. I judge a restaurant on everything from its bread & butter to the component of every dish. The bread & butter are nothing to shout about here ;) but the dishes are great, meat, sauces, risotto, etc. but they miss out on key components like the vegetables. We both commented we would have preferred fresher less cooked vegetables with our entrees, you can see this in the photos. But all-in-all the food is good and it's a great experience restaurant.",

I ordered arriabata penne and it was tasty but clearly sat under a heat lamp or something because the top has sauce on it but it was hardened and dry.  ( we also waited an hour for our food so idk what happened there...)   I'll be back again though for sure to give it another go!",

My husband invited the gentleman singer to come over to the table to serenade me, which was very romantic. He has a great table side presence.    The staff is attentive and the food was great with healthy sized portions.    We will definatly return to enjoy another entertaining evening.",

Just to experience the restaurants environment is already a plus. The moment you walk in, you have no idea what your getting yourself into. Since its a mob theme you walk into a small room with a phone booth and pictures, and when you ring the door bell a man greets you behind a framed picture and a secret door opens up to a beautiful dark romantic room! As your seated a menu with a flashlight is given to you and the atmosphere has a romantic yet mob feeling to it. The Caesar Salad was to die for it was the best Caesar Salad I have ever eaten!! My husband had the \"Scarface Shrimp Scampi'\" and I Had the Don's Spaghetti.\" my hubby's was just alright but the Spaghetti was scrumptious! I had the chocolate Martini it was strong, decadent and Delicious! You should make reservations cause this place gets packed!  They also have live entertainment with a piano player and a guy who sings old school songs! Good place to take Baby Boomer Parents! The experience alone is well worth it! We definitely will return!",

    "text": "So...it's been almost a month since my most recent visit and my anger is finally starting to subside long enough for me to update my past review for this place. I should also note that I have eaten at Capo's (both locations) many times since my first review. It had become a place we take out of town guests, celebrate birthdays, and basically go for our \"favorites\" on \"just because nights\". I have also recommended this restaurant to everyone I encounter that is looking for a great experience and great meal. Well, that is now in the past.  When Valentines Day started to approach this year Capos was the front runner for our night out. We made reservations two weeks in advance and then about a week before we called to add another couple to our guest count. We were all so excited and looking forward to it!! Both people on the phone were very nice and we added to our reservation with ease. We always order the same things when we go and we were looking forward to sharing the evening with good friends.  When we arrived we were quickly led to our table. As we settled into our table we realized that a paper menu had been placed in front of us as opposed to the regular one. When the back server came to the table first to fill our water glasses we told him that we were not given menus. He began to tell us that the regular menu was not available that evening and the paper menu was the one that was. I quickly glanced at the menu noticing that our favorite dishes were no where to be found. It was clear that this was a special \"set menu\" with of course, inflated prices. When the server approached our table we asked politely if we could speak to a manager. Several minutes later a woman approached our table, presumably the manager. I began to explain that we had come to enjoy their wonderful regular menu and were disappointed that in the two phone conversations I had making the reservations NO ONE had told us that a limited menu would be served that night.  Ok...breathe....  The woman responded not with an apology or an offer of a solution, but rather, with insult to myself and my guests. She said that \"we\" should have just expected that because of the holiday there would be a set menu. She continued to explain that they had called many other restaurants in the area and that \"80% of them were offering the same thing\". To add further insult, she then pointed around the room at the other tables and said, \"no one else seems to have a problem with it\". That was it. That was the moment when Capo's went from my favorite restaurant in the city to one I will never eat at again. My party and I got up and left of course and ended up at another great family owned, Italian restaurant in town where we enjoyed a wonderful four course meal with great wine, fantastic homemade food, and great friends.  I have been in the food and beverage industry for 13 years and I was completely shocked by how a manager could treat guests. Also, if you are going to have a \"set menu\" on a particular night, then fine, but inform your guests. To be quite honest, had we been told during the reservation process of the limited menu would would have just made a reservation for the following night (we were all off from work the next night too and the chance to order all of the stuff we come back for would have been worth waiting a day)",

You have to ring a doorbell before you walk in and once you enter there is dim lighting, a guy singing, and an overall fun atmosphere. The staff was really friendly and attentive. The dark lighting makes it hard to read the menus but good thing they have flashlights inside. Definitely try the salad with the garlic dressing it is so delicious. I got the arrabiata pasta and added a meatball and was so disappointed our hotel didn't have a fridge because I would have loved to eat the left overs. This is a great place to go for a date or as a group. Even though it is a little off the strip it is totally worth it for the great experience. Capo's is definitely a place I will be returning to next time I am in Vegas. We also made reservations..not sure if it is required but I would definitely recommend it. We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation time and were immediately seated.",

I reserved a booth about 24 hours prior to our visit on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a> website and we got right in.  I was surprised I got the booth I requested and had no waiting.  My group dressed up for the mob look and played along with the door man and staff.  We told the doorman we were with the Chicago outfit and wanted to feed our appetites, NOW! Since we did have reservations, we got right in and were treated with kind respect. We had wonderful service and no complaints.  The menu lights were fine but I brought my own lights just for fun. The food was above average and the desserts were to die for so save room.  I had the Lasagna and enjoyed the heart of it but I moved the marinara sauce to one side. It was too garlic tasting for my liking but the Lasagna was great. For dessert we had a chocolate mud cake, canoli and cheesecake.  All were fantastic in that order. The singer was good and friendly and will take requests within the line of Sinatra songs. Have him sing one for your sweetheart. You have to try this dining experience but please people, dress up and play along with them for ultimate enjoyment. The more you are prepared for this place the more fun it will be.  Let your hair down and enjoy the Italian speakeasy atmospere. I feel like they improved thier food and service since some of the past negitive surveys listed some issues at that time. Try it, you'll like it.",

Yes it was dark , but that was ok. Bathrooms are one person only and small , but again that's ok.  The meal.  First , we were on time for our reservation and our table was open , but we had to sit at the bar for 10 minutes, just enough time to order a drink which the tab had to be closed out before going to the table. My GF order one of their specialty cocktails, it was good. I asked for a glass of the house Chianti, the barmaid said they did not have one. Ok, I will wait and order something at the table.  Once seated we were give the menu's with the flashlights, well one of the two had flashlights, and a wine list. Sure enough on the first page was a list of wine's by the glass and there was a Chianti.......sigh.... It was tasty and I had two of them.  The menu was creative with all of the mob names. The bread was great , hot and fresh, but then you had to struggle with the butter in the little foil packets.  Both of our salads had potential, but ended up being a little watery. She likes Ranch, not on the Capo's list.  The calamari was very tasty, fried with some hot peppers and dipping sauce like Outbacks Bloomin Onion sauce.  For dinner we went with the basics  Her Lasagna was ok , very cheesy , and a bit over cooked.  My spaghetti was cooked fine, it was just smother in red sauce and the kitchen sprinkled Parmesan cheese on it for me... I did not ask for it and I do not normally put it on my pasta.  On the upside the Italian sausage I added to the dish was pretty good.  We did not have dessert.  Service throughout the dinner was good  They called a cab for us and let me know when it arrived.  The bill for two drinks each and dinner was $86.00 plus tip  So the rating was more for the food then the rest of the dining experience.  I do not see myself going back, to many other places to try",

The theme was pretty neat but it was so dark you had to use a flashlight to see the menu which they do have attached but only about 25% of them work so make sure your phone is charged. We came during happy hour and they told all of us it did not apply to us because we were too big of a party. Needless to say, I think 2 people ordered a $8 beer but they could have made much more money off us if they allowed the happy hour for the last 30 minutes there was left to encourage more drinking during the meal. Food was super overpriced for what you get. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good but I can make a pasta meal at home that's just as good for $20 for 5 people as opposed to $20-$30/plate. They don't split checks, so come with cash and if you want to split a meal with someone expect to pay $6 more.",

Let's just say that it was a good type of disturbed. Chicago Mafia-Style all the way. You get screened prior to entering in a rather fun kind of way. Once seated it was hard to admire the appointments. I'm telling you it was so dark that they literally have flashlights tied to the menus so that you can read them. That was kind of cool and romantic since I was trying to be all cuddly with my sweetie (for the night anyway). LOL Back to the review. I ordered the pecan crusted Chilean Sea Bass. It was the best that I've ever had. Who'd of thought that that far away from the ocean would be the best cut of bass one can find? It was LARGE too. The service was spectacular. The entertainment had a old school Italian feel as the singer was walking around engaging the customers while dining. It was a very cool experience. So, if you're in Vegas and want to get off of the beaten path and away from the colon locking buffets.. Try this place out and be amazed!",

    "text": "Let's say no stars whatsoever, shall we? \"Capo's is a must\"? A must to avoid!  This qualifies as the all-time-worst restaurant or entertainment experience -- and this in more than  35 years of fine-dining experiences all over the world. In fact, it has a unique distinction: it is the first time a party of which I was a member was given the bum's rush. We were as good as ordered out of the restaurant (no weapons in evidence, however). This, for having the temerity to criticize the food when asked!  Here's the rundown. We were three, out for a night on the town and straight from the (soon-to-be landmark) Don Rickles show at the Orleans. We had determined to have dinner at Capo's since a member of the group recommended it. We arrived at about 10 p.m. on March 21, were seated promptly, and ordered enough food and drink to account for a check of more than $200 (we hadn't ordered dessert yet).  After a wait of more than 25 minutes between the first and second courses, we received our entrees: chicken parmigiana, manicotti with eggplant, and veal piccata. The unifying factor among three disparate plates was that all were overcooked. We each took a few bites of our dishes, discussed our disappointment, and then the server arrived. It was as if he heard us, which was unlikely, given the ambient din. We made our complaints known. The one of us who had ordered the manicotti then told him: \"Look, I know how this was prepared, and it wasn't prepared properly. It was made and served in the same sizzle-tray, so the cheese is now burned onto the bottom of the metal plate!\"  (For what it is worth, the diner with this specific criticism is a chef at a well-known kitchen in a Las Vegas fine-dining restaurant a few cuts above this red-sauce Italian place.)  Two waiters who heard our complaints seemed sympathetic but somewhat disbelieving, saying, \"Whatever, we want to make it right, OK?  How about some beverages and dessert on us?\" We agreed; they took our orders and had the table cleared. I had eaten three bites of the toughest veal on record, covered in a gelatinous, objectionably flavored piccata sauce.  As we settled back, there was another figure at our table, questioning us excitedly, a minion at his side moving the table. The questioner, incongruously dressed in the distressed jeans and screen-printed,  long-sleeved T-shirt of an aging hipster, demanded to know why we were still sitting there if nothing had  met with our approval. \"I don't want you in  this place if you're unhappy! Why don't you leave!\"  So we did. We were met at the door by the maitre d', who was perplexed at our abrupt departure. He claimed not to recognize from our description who might have demanded our ouster.  However, no one was more surprised, perplexed, feeling ill-used -- to say nothing of hungry -- than we were. Not only won't we be back, but we doubt anyone each of the three of us knows will cast shadows on these dark doorsteps.",

    "text": "Heard good things about this place. My first impressions of the cool entrance and atmosphere inside were great. Then for the most important parts of a reataurant, the food and service...it took about 45 minutes for our 2 dishes to come out and we had to flag down someone each time we needed refills on our waters. Then the food finally came out...lasagna and shrimp scampi...2 of the most recommended dishes from the staff. The scampi had clearly been sitting under the lamp for a long time and was hard and crusty on top and the shrimp was rubbery and dry. It looked nothing at all like all the delicious pictures in reviews on yelp. It was simply a pile of butter with hard angel hair and over done shrimp with a touch of spiciness. No lemon or garlic flavor at all like the menu said. The lasagna was also very dry. The server was nice but was very busy and kind of forced to  neglect us as we were only a party of 2 and he had a huge party of 14 come in right after us. The manager was hanging out at the bar sipping wine the whole night while our server who seemed to be the only one working was running his ass off. Then we had to wait about 10 minutes after our plates we're cleared just to get our bill. $56 for 2 dishes and no alcohol. Waaaaaay overpriced for such bad food. Won't be going back. Great atmosphere and all but horrible food and service and way overpriced. They nailed everything except the 2 most important parts of a restaurant, the food and service. 2 stars just because I loved the entrance and atmosphere. If there were separate categories to rate I would give this 5 stars and the food and service 0 stars.",

I spoke with someone who was cleaning there and he told me that the owner had closed it and was re-opening it as a Mexican restaurant called Baja Cantina, after some renovations.   I went  to the Sahara location it was very good, it was my first time and the experience was great.  The restaurant has the same speakeasy entrance and the restaurant inside is beautiful. The bar was full and the dining area busy.  I had a drink and the meatball app, it was even better than at Tropicana!  I will  miss the Tropicana location, but I will certainly enjoy this place as well!",

The food is great - five star for sure - but sloppily prepared, way overpriced and presented with an air of arrogance and intimidation.

    "text": "FINALLY SOME REAL ITALIAN FOOD IN VEGAS :D Believe me we have had everything from $-$$$$ Italian here in Vegas. Call ahead and make reservations. It's an experience just walking through the door :) I will not post a spoiler :)  Sit back and relax, everything is very carefully made to order and extremely fresh.  Yes it has very low lighting and yes it has a piano playing man singing karaoke machine microphone songs but his voice is very good, so no worries. It is True about there being small LED lights attached to the menu so you can use them if needed.  Every dish we had was spot on and the house Merlot was really amazing. Our waitress was smiley and nice and she did not come to the table much, only when needed, I like that!  We started after being greeted with water as we still had our Merlot from the bar area. (Bartenders are pretty ladies in black tiny corsets. Very nice and complimented me!)  Started with house loaf of fresh baked sourdough/Italian/French type of bread. Firm on outside and airy on inside (my fav kind) the butter that came with it was flavored with garlic, chive and possibly sage.  We ordered everything at once, we knew what we wanted :)  We started with Bruschetta and yummmmmm it was a treat! Fresh and chilled it seemed like a fresh Italian salsa almost! It was the perfect blend of garlic, fresh tomatoes, basil, EVOO, balsamic and a tiny bit of parm maybe. The bread was the same only toasted and looked brushed prior to toast with butter? Hubby had a Caeser salad which was perfect (not too much anchovies) and fresh with just the right amount of dressing! Our friend he had a house with Blue Cheese and it was gone before I could try (my fav thing is BC) and he said it was perfect :) When I ordered a really always do salad but the soup was calling my name, thank goodness I asked her what it was and if she likes it, she said \"it's very popular and very good\" sold! The soup is a creamy tomato base soup with white bean and small pene like noodles, if I had a grilled cheese......it would be heaven on earth. Not too many beans, not too many noodles a dash of fine grated cheese on top. Perfect.   Between courses it's very relaxed and the dim lighting is sooooo nice. We sat in a booth straight across from the entrance area (the place is large) and hubby sat in the middle inside the booth.  He mentioned \"a real boss knows to always have your back, as in you sit against the wall :)\" as he said that I noticed all the mirrors above the booth :)  You just feel Goodfellas. Even the door guy is a \"tough guy\" and comes out of the back \"slapping shut\" the check holders about once every half hour :)  After ordering another glass of wine and enjoying each others company here come our entrees :)  Our friend had chicken parm with the side of pasta spaghetti and gravy it usually comes with. He said it was wonderful.  Hubby had the veal parm a beautiful cutlet smothered with gravy and mozzarella and instead of the pasta he got garlic mash. We are garlic lovers and warning IN EVERYTHING THERE IS A LOT :) not too much for us. (yes there is a toooo much)  The garlic mash was a fresh skin on garlic, butter, a dash of cream, thick mash. It was how I make mine and it was delish.  I ordered veal picatta. It was a thin cutlet not coated but very very tender in a heavenly picatta. A perfect blend of white wine, butter, EVOO, capers and just a dash of parsley. For my sub out of pasta I had mushroom risotto, it was EXTREMELY rich and creamy, on the firm side and full of fresh parm. The side dish dipped in my buttery dish wow................just wow.  Slowly but gracefully we tried each others yumm'd and ahhhh'd......and at the end we forgot we were told to \"try the chocolate cannolis\"   She came by and we were all stuffed and happy but I asked anyway \"how big and how many are in an order lol\". She said \"just two and about like this\" (maybe 4\") Cannolis were divine!!!!!! Perfect, rich crispy, creamy.  That was our experience! We were told about this place from Brian (owner of Wing King) who had his birthday dinner there the other night.  That's our experience! PS when I say gravy I mean tomato sauce :) Portions are large so I would split if you get an app. But always save room for a bite of cannoli!!!!!  I'm so glad we came. I LOVE THIS PLACE! Next time I want to order a vegetarian dish that I saw and try a different app.",

Nice wine list. (A bit pricy).  Definitely take advantage of the two for one Tuesday dinners. It's actually just a $20 discount off your bill. So a bit misleading. But still it got me in the door.",

I will not tell you how the entrance is but you must go to find out! After we entered, we had to wait 10 minutes for a reservation we were 5 minutes early too. Not a big deal but was a little annoying. Once seated, the atmosphere was very pleasant. Live Italian entertainment, friendly service, romantic design. They even had a very good magician going table to table performing incredible Magic tricks. That was the highlight of the night for me. The guy was phenomenal. After we were entertained to a magic show, our food had arrived. I ordered the Chicken Parm & it was absolutely fantastic. My date and I split some calamari as a starter which was top of the line as well. Overall, this place was awesome. I highly recommend checking it out for a date or a group dinner.",

We started with the CALAMARI which was golden brown with a nice crisp yet tender in the center. The marinara was tangy and in perfect combo with the calamari. Then after hearing so much about the MEATBALLS, our group got 3 orders and I must say they were the best meatballs anyone's ever tasted!! A little pricey at $12 but worth every penny!!  Service was rushed but the place was packed so we enjoyed the live entertainment while we waited a bit for our entrees. My boyfriend's STEAK was awesome and perfectly cooked. My SAUSAGE and PEPPERS was as I remembered from my last trip to Chicago... Delicious!!!  Overall I would have given Capos 5 stars if the service wasn't so rushed but this was by far the best dinner our group had over a weeks stay in Las Vegas.   I definitely will be returning and sending friends!!",

From the time you knock on the door to enter the restaurant, you feel like you have been transported back to someone's dream of old Vegas, complete with dark lighting and a Frank Sinatra-style crooner.  The food is much better than it needs to be for a theme restaurant like this one.  (I would give the food 3.5 stars by itself.) Everyone enjoyed their meal, and the enormous meatballs were a big hit.    The singer engaged the audience in his performance and even invited a couple members of our party to sing along with one of the songs.  He also took the time to talk with people at various tables in between songs.  If you haven't been to Capo's, I highly suggest that you check it out.  I plan on bringing all future out-of-town visitors to this gem of a restaurant.    The prices seemed reasonable, too.  If you go Sunday-Thursday, you also can buy a certificate on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> and get $50 worth of food for $25.",

    "text": "This is my all time favorite place to eat!!!!! My husband and i went here during one of our many trips to Vegas.  From the outside it doesn't look like anything too special but that almost adds to its charm.  You enter though a secret door like the old school mob movies. It has a very intimate feeling when you walk in. Seating is private and comfortable,Live music that was AMAZING.. walks up to the table to sing to you but not too much. So for me the atmosphere and service was already giving them major points in my book.  Now the food ... WOWWWW We started with the meatballs as an appetizer,best meatballs I have ever had, and I even loved the red sauce it was in( i'm super picky because my family makes our own) The pasta we ordered tasted homemade and fresh, so  amazing. we each got a diff pasta and we both loved each.The pricing is great!!  service is top notch reminded me of eating at Mortins Steakhouse but a much for nostalgic experience. We had such a great time dining we didn't want to leave so moved over to the bar area where we continued to listed to songs we loved from our fav Frank Sinatra and others from that era. Since going the first time we have made this a MUSt stop on each of our other Vegas vacations we have taken and will continue to keep coming back.",

When you first walk in your in a small room and you have to ring a bell which after the host opens a secret window to ask who sent you! We had reservations for 6:15PM and were able to sit down within 10 mins. There is a small bar to sit at also which if you sit there your able to see the chefs cook in front of you. Our server was so polite and gave us awesome recommendations. I ended up getting the spaghetti with meat sauce (huge portion) and a side salad. It was definitely the best spaghetti I've ever had. No dessert for us this time due to be over full from the bread they bring out before your meal arrives. Most definitely will be returning to this place.",

We can NOT say enough about how good the food and service was!  We shared the meatballs appetizer, the Eggplant Parmesan with Risotto and the infamous \"Leftovers\" which is not on the menu so you have to ask for it. Each item was truly delicious and prepared perfectly.  We have never had better Italian food ANYWHERE!  And the family red sauce that is featured on several items?  We were left speechless it was so good...We have never tasted a red sauce so good.  The service was top-notch with warm and friendly (an VERY attentive) employees.  This will now be on our list of \"Must visits\" from now on whenever we are in the area!",

Went with my son for a special evening out, very bad decision.  Ceasar salads were drab, over garlicky. They must have been prepared for a while - very limp and lifeless. I had about 3 bites of mine.  The veal parmesan was completely over cooked, over-breaded, drowning in sauce and cheese -terrible. Raviolis were chewy, salty in a watery red sauce.  Plus side - cheesy garlic bread was good.  Maybe it's because I travel, dine frequently in SF, Chicago, NYC - very much enjoy good. Definitely not here, will not come back or recommend.  Left hungry and unsatisfied, home to a bowl of cereal and bed.",

I love the live music and the magic tricks that will def blow your mind away! I definitely recommend this to everyone! Not only this restaurant is very historic, it also serves delicious food and great entertainment. It's 3 in 1 so i must say very worth the visit!

Food was delicious and the customer service is literally one of the best I've experienced in life - period. I love how on top of their service game they are. And the vibe you get from the atmosphere is an exciting experience. I so wanna dish the details but don't wanna ruin it for anyone. Just be ready for a great time. Definitely have to bring my bf to this place. Many thanks and you'll be seeing me very soon!",

We didn't know that reservations are HIGHLY recommended, but after we found the entrance, \"Vito\" (not his real name but definitely looked like him from the Godfather), made room for us.  The waitstaff is on-point.  The food was on point.  The guy \"singing\" at the piano, well, he was a character for sure and added to the vibe.  This place it mob city fun, but everything was fabulous.  Plus with YELP check-in, it's $10 off $75, which is not hard to do with most meals stating at $20.  The creamy garlic dressing we yummy, and the fettuccine Alfredo was divine.  Hubby had GINORMOUS lasagna and the meatballs are the bomb!",

They have excellent customer service. They also make it feel like a lounge with a person singing and playing music. It's quiet enough to still be able to have a conversation. I wouldn't bring my kids here though. To me, it has a more mature feel.",

Unfortunately I didn't think of reserving it until about 4 days before Valentines. The only time they had left was 9:45 PM. I reserved it anyway.  I was a little concerned they'd be rushing us to finish our meal, so we arrived about 40 minutes early. I figured we could have a couple of drinks at the bar if they weren't able to seat us. Fortunately they were able to seat us right away.  Our waitress, Mettia, was awesome! Attentive and professional and friendly.  The ambiance was great.  The food was mediocre and we waited over an hour from when we placed our order for the food to arrive.  The staff and ambiance are reason enough for a return visit. I just hope they can improve the quality of their food and the speed of delivery.  Overall we really enjoyed ourselves and would recommend it to others.",

    "text": "Amazing food, great service, and such a fun concept with it being a Speakeasy.  The entrance alone set the tone for what a fun meal we would have.  You'll understand what that means once you actually go here, and you need to go here!  I loved the mobster throwback feel once inside.  From the pictures and some mug shots of gangsters on the wall to the low-dimmed lighting, it really set the mood of feeling like I was in a restaurant from years past.  Our group of 6 were quickly seated and attended to, and I said service was very good.   Now for the food--all very good!  We went with their lunch specials, and for the most part everyone in the party ordered either the meatball sub or the Italian beef.  I had the meatball sub, and boy are they some good tasting (and good sized) meatballs.  However, the Italian beef was EXCELLENT.  I would definitely get this next time.  Great flavor, great texture, the bread was delicious (as was the hoagie the meatball sub came on).    Sandwiches came with a choice of side: either french fries or a pasta salad.  My parents had been to this restaurant before and said neither side was that great.  Their complaint was the french fries came with some sauce of some kind already on them, and they were not a fan.  The waitress said they could do the sauce on the side, which I went with--I have no idea what this sauce was, but it was delicious!  So delicious that I definitely could have been looking the little bowl it came in clean with my finger.  I'm very excited to go back and try it again with the sauce actually on the fries.  Morale of the story: Don't listen to my parents (That's why they aren't Yelp Elite!).   Definitely try this restaurant.  All employees were very friendly, prices were super reasonable, and it was just a fun overall experience.",

Why invite a lady on your first trip together and not make definite plans on where to eat!!!??? Especially a foodie like myself. BUT man was I happy we came here!!!!!! We took a cab (one of the nicest cabbies ever,) He dropped us off in this 1980s looking center and I was like Hmmmmmm OKKKKKKKKK. But that all changed. Rang the bell and we look forward and all of a sudden to the right of us the host with heavy mob accent asked us if we made rsvps and yes we did. Who knows if we didn't.      We were seated in a nice big booth. The service was great. Our waitress was so nice and a former resident of Irvine so that was lovely. We started with some martinis and they were made so good and refreshing. We started with Tony's \"Duck\" soup and an order of meatballs. I don't know what's in the Duck soup but it was so good. The meatballs are what they're known for and OMG one of the best meatballs I've ever had. So moist and very flavorful. I remember watching their segment on Man vs. Food and I recall drooling over that scene and now I had the chance to be like Adam and indulge. This should be ordered EVERY TIME!!!!  For our entrees I ordered the veal parm and my side was mushroom risotto. He ordered the Lasagna. The portions are HUGE. I told him I was happy to share an entree because I didn't know if our hotel fridge was big enough. Some how it fit :p I guess my date was in no mood to share. I'm usually not a veal parm person but this chicken parm was addicting. I couldn't stop eating it and If I took one more bite, I'd get sick. The risotto was good but it was all about the parm. I've been thinking about it every time I crave Italian food. I tried his Lasagna and it was very good. Even he couldn't eat it all. Very satisfying meal.          Overall I had a great time here and the gentleman that sung Frank sinatra was awesome, I thought they were just playing music til I looked back and it was live. He was spot on. The food was so good, I wanted to come back just to take leftovers back to Cali LOL. I can't wait to come back!!!!!",

As someone who grew up on Italian food, overall the food was just ok. The chicken parmigiana was a bit overdone and the sauce on the pasta was fair. As far as the theme, it was nonexistent for us. They seated us in a back room and we had no exposure to any theme (just a dark room) and we could barely hear the music in the main room. The customer service was decent, but nothing special. Overall we were disappointed.",

The lights are low but they provide you a little light for the menu. I've never had a dish that disappointed me from the meatballs, stuffed chicken Anastasia, chicken parm, lasagna it's all delicious! You won't be disappointed!",

Upon arrival, it looks like any other restaurant, but the surprise is yet to come.  I won't spoil it, but this is a Chicago mob-themed restaurant.  You'll see.  This is a great place to take someone from out of town.  Tourists, you must check Capo's out.  Just like the other reviews, the place is dark, so allow your eyes to adjust.  The atmosphere is fantastic, the music is fantastic, and the service is phenomenal.  Although our waiter was Paul (who is excellent), everyone that walked by checked on us.  The food!  WOW!!!  The house bread, amazing!  We had the cheesy garlic bread for an app....5 stars.  The creamy garlic side salad....5 stars.  The drinks.....The Kick in the Head, the Espresso Martini, (had a few more but forget the names) were top notch....5 stars.  Our dinner, Vinnie's Alla Vodka with blackened chicken.....this is knock your socks off good!  Try it.  You will not be disappointed.    What an awesome place, and I can't wait to go back.  Someone asked if this was my new favorite Italian restaurant....and since Italian dishes vary by region, and are often prepared differently, I don't have a \"favorite,\" however, this will be one of my regular spots!",

(I was an only child and went everywhere with my parents in the 60's)  The service was outstanding, the live music was an amazing surprise, the dark and \"mob\" like sultry atmosphere, made for a sexy date night BUT the FOOD, is why I will come back! The best carbonara I have ever had... seriously! The meatball appetizer and garlic cheese bread was fantastic. Even the salads were deliciously... clearly, in house made dressing!  It is also cool that you need a secret password to get in... in the secret entrance. Call... tell them I sent you... ask for the password of the day.... then, go and have your best night in Vegas. (So much better than Sinatra... a tourist trap... seriously, don't waste your money)",

As a black 20 something from Miami, I have no clue of whether or not the food is authentically Italian but it's tasty! Way better than Olive Garden and more delectable than Maggianos which I love! There were plenty reviews about the wait staff being horrid but our service was farther from this revelation. Our waiter Jeremy was amazingly friendly, knowledgeable and quick. His partner (sadly didn't catch the name) was also ensuring our waters remained full and a smile on our face. The host was amazing and made me feel right at home...if home was a backdoor restaurant with mob deals in the back and card games up front! This was a Thursday night and although crowded, they fit us in with a reservation 3 hours before. There was a love pianist signing his rendition of Sinatra mixed with some r&b. I have never heard a Sinatra voice sing Stevie Wonder but ummmmmmmm let's just say the food was delish lol!!!!!!! Lovely date night, will be back. Oh, and order the Kick in the Head!",

My plate was veal Marsala it was good to with spaghetti not to bad but the only thing was there were to different sauces next time I would ask for the Marsala sauce on both.

    "text": "I went to Capo's for a Valentine's Day dinner with some friends last night. We had a party of 8, the maximum number reservation they allow via Opentable. This was my 2nd visit to Capo's, my first being April 2018 (also a party of 8). So the following is my low down on this \"joint.\"  Pros: Capo's is definitely worth visiting for the atmosphere itself. It's not a huge place but rather cozy and the faux Mafia \"speakeasy\" theme, with the fake front door with password entry, Sinatra posters on the walls, and dark low lighting decor, is always fun--although it would be even more fun if they did more with it. The food is quite good-to-excellent depending on what you order and follows the usual old school Italian fare one would find at this type of restaurant. Service was generally good on both visits. Last night they had a singer crooning Sinatra hits to background tracks, which was nice.  Cons: along with the Mafia-theme comes the \"you do what we tell you\" attitude from management. If you have any requests slightly out of the ordinary (party bigger than 8, separate checks), they are NOT very accommodating or flexible...it's \"too hard\"...\"too much trouble.\" They do have a couple of separate rooms for bigger parties but you have to email someone who might or might not reply to you (the \"not\" happened to me) and you have to order from a banquet menu. I called to follow up and the host who answered acted like he was too busy to talk to me and I was bothering him and was no help. Last night they had a special Valentine's Day menu; cheapest meal package was $50 and you could NOT order off the regular menu. They didn't inform me of that before I got there.  Bottomline: Capo's is ideal for romantic dinners for 2 or a friendly dinner amongst no more than up to 6 friends after payday when you want to splurge. Not the cheapest place but not the most expensive either. They don't do separate checks but allow up to 4 credit cards. They have a happy hour but the bar is tiny. Waitstaff/bartenders are generally friendly. Only thing is that the vibe I feel from management is more what the customers can do for \"them\" rather than the other way around.   If you want more flexibility with a larger party but with better live entertainment, check out Casa di Amore. It's a bit more spacious, bigger portions (good for take home), and management is easier to deal with.",

The food was just as delicious as when I dined there as a party of two.  We told our guests to dress in Roaring 20s attire, and surprised them with a last minute location reveal. Everyone kept raving about the decor, food and entertainment. My oldest daughter got to sing with her grandma and the pianist. My mom was moved to tears by the entire evening and said she would cherish these memories for the rest of her life. THANK YOU, JANEEN!!!",

Now onto the service... You will taken care of by servers donned in bow ties and suspenders with thick Italian accents. They'll tell you the specials for the day, make recommendations and attend to your every need throughout your visit.   And then there's the food! The warm bread basket sets the mood for comfort food. I went straight for Tony's duck soup and spaghetti with Mamas meatballs, and washed it down with a glass of delicious Moscato wine. My table mate tried to penne ala Vodka and loved the pink sauce. We were both too full for dessert thought there was a good selection of age old favorites.   We heard there were other secret adventures to be had at capos, like a rumored secret poker room located behind a huge portrait of Al Capone, but we decided to save a few things to discover on our next visit. We will be going back!",

    "text": "We chose Capo's for my brother's 60th birthday dinner while we were vacationing in Las Vegas because the Speakeasy aspect looked fun and it received good reviews. Unfortunately, our experience was completely opposite of our expectations. We were a party of four and my husband has a small, extremely well behaved (and hypoallergenic-more on that later) fully documented service dog. After going through the door, we were immediately met by two floor managers that said they had three servers that were allergic to dogs and might not be able to seat us. They asked us to wait at the bar. We ordered drinks and waited a good 15 minutes or more. I noted that the restaurant was not full, in fact when I made the Open Table reservation there was ample availability, and there were many servers on the floor.  We saw them carry in what amounted to a card table into a side room away from the entire Speakeasy/restaurant. They ushered us into this empty room and had us sit at this makeshift table that they tried for several minutes to shim it so it would not wobble. Needless to say, there was zero experience. Also, to say that the property is a bit tired, is an understatement. I did not make a big deal out of it because I did not want to further ruin my brother's celebration. Service was terrible, food was ok, but most importantly, we all felt like unwelcome pariahs.   If I could give this \"establishment\" negative stars, I would. Not only did they break the law by discriminating against us by not treating us like any other customer because of our service dog (who by the way, lies under the table and no one ever even knows he is there) they went out of their way to make us feel unwelcome. We will also be filing an ADA complaint against them.",

The service which we were given by our waiter instantly changed. He became less attentive and less sincere after telling him we had a Groupon. Thing is, I've been here multiple times. I have no problem paying full price but I wasn't going to let my money go to waste on the Groupon I can't get my money back for. We received less food and I felt uncomfortable the waiter changed his level of service. It was disappointing.",

The food was delicious. Everything tasted amazing. With your meal, you get bread as well as a choice of soup or salad and you alsofet tochoose a side of either spaghetti, risotto, mashed potatoes or vegetables. It's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for...good food. My one complaint, is the time it took for our food to come out. I wish it would've come out a lot quicker. The atmosphere is relaxing. It's pretty dark inside and they have calming Frank Sinatra type music playing. I'd definitely recommend trying the place out.",

It looks very quiet on the outside of the building but as soon as we were admitted inside, it showed a lot of live patrons and busy busslings of staff members.  Before our entrance to the establishment, we were in an area that had a sign that said \"Ring the door bell for entrance\". We did. Then a few seconds later, a small peek window behind a photo frame opened and out came a gentleman's face asking us questions and passwords before entrance. It was a pleasant surprise. He then opened a hidden door behind a mounted phone booth and that's where we entered!  We were sat immediately and our hostess, Marlea was very pleasant, friendly, helpful, & gracious. It was our first time at at Cop's and we are pleased with our experience. Marlea was patient wit us and gave us great recommendations. I recommend siting where she hosts when you visit because she will take good care of you.  I recommend this establishment to everyone. Food is amazing and flavorful with authentic Italian food.  I am not a big Spaghetti person compared to my love of white sauce pasta or Seafoods pasta but their Spaghetti sauce is really great! One of the few places where I will eat Spaghetti. The meals are made with fresh ingredients and, I'm sure, is also made fresh daily.   GO TO THIS PLACE, IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT!",

First of all they couldn't find my reservations, I emailed them specifically requested a booth for a special occasion, because they couldn't find my reservation they put me in a little table in the middle not very romantic at all. I had the spaghetti and meatballs the spaghetti was lukewarm the meatball was burnt on one side and hard. My girlfriend had the lasagna which was hard on the sides overcooked, during our second glass of wine they kept trying to rush us out before and after I pay the bill. I've been here before but after last night service and food quality I don't think I'll be back. When I feel like having  Italian food again I'll go to the Italian American Club where I know the quality is good",

The restaurant opened for lunch at 11:00a but we got there a little early and couldn't really tell where the entrance was. We parked and looked like the place was boarded up... turns out the front entrance was not so obvious. In fact, we entered in this wooden door to find another closed door that was a waiting room (no seats). We had to ring the doorbell and wait until someone opened a little peep window to let us in. This little waiting place had photos of wanted mafia members and dons. We were let inside the restaurant by a host who looked like he portrayed an associate dressed as a gangster, suspenders and all, and led us past the bar to the back section of the restaurant.   The quiet, casual elegant setting had a mob theme with the red leather seats, the glass chandeliers, the black wallpapered walls, and more photos of mafia dons and gangsters hung on the walls. It was like a scene from The Godfather, the movie. It is dark inside. The wait staff catered to our needs as we were served green salad w/ garlic dressing, bread/butter and our orders. I had the \"Capones Carbonara\" (pancetta, tomatoes, peas, red onions, shallots & fettuccini tossed in garlic egg cream sauce). Eccelente! Mangia!!! Hubby had the  \"Vinnie's Chicken Parmesan Melt\" (chicken breast, breaded, fried, topped with mozzarella cheese and their secret sauce). If reading that description didn't make your mouth water, well, there are lots more from their menu to choose from and cleverly named with mafia themes. Our food and the atmosphere was great!  The restaurant looked like it can accommodate large groups and banquets as well as intimate dinners for two . There is a private room and it had a booth that can seat two, it also had a screen like you can watch a movie or something. This room had a door and it is in between the bar and the restroom away from the rest of the dining area.   Located less than 15 minutes from the Strip this made our dining experience unforgettable! Thought that we would get a visit from the don himself... after all, Las Vegas had a history of mafia crime lords.  Review #0459",

It's a full mafia atmosphere!   I chose the Scarface Shrimp Scampi. Let me tell you..........it was freakin' delicious! HOWEVER........it was lacking in shrimp. And for a plate that costs almost $27, I really expected a main dish to have more than just 4 little shrimps!! When I mentioned it to the waiter, he just laughed and brushed my comment off. Gave no explanation and made no effort to make things right. If the owner ever reads this, I'd love to know if only 4 shrimp is common practice!? But, it was still yummy!  I was there with a group of 9. We had all used different modes of transportation to get to the restaurant from our hotel. Upon leaving, the restaurant arranged for a party bus to pick us up and take us to our next destination!  As you exit the restaurant, you'll find evidence left behind on the floor. The outline of a body! Quite comical!  I'd eat there again, but if I ordered the same thing, I would definitely ask about the quantity of shrimp I can expect!!",

We planned this or so my wife had it planned prior to leaving Vegas to check this place.  This was unusually old school 20's style , mafia theme restaurant.  We got there when it opened at 11 am and have ring the doorbell ... It's funny the waiter would open a peep window and look and let us in.  Just like how the mafias back in the 20's were.  Lol it was kind of dark inside, lots of poster of former Mafiosos and big bosses such as Capone, lucky Luciano and so on.  All these time i was there I was expecting to be gun downed by a rival mafia lol.  It was really an original setting with a touch of Italy !!!! Or should I say Sicily .,,,  The waiter and waitress were dressed non black... The make attendants wore white suspenders.... Just like what machine gun kelly would look back then.  Any way we got our food, it was a full lunch meal with salad as starter and bread, I had me a \"vinny\" chicken Parmesan.  It was pretty good.  Hey if you ever be in Vegas and want to feel like the mafia is around you ... Come to this place ...",

We've never done so before due to being with the kids all of the time.   Well, it's the full menu and drinks so not that much of a difference. Our waitress was amazing and timely cautious and attending to us right on que.   The food was Simply AMAZING. Real ingredients, fresh, tasteful, delightful, filling and the Turtle cheesecake was phenomenal!   All of the meats that we had were Blackened Chicken, Shrimp and Ma's Meat Balls and ALL were cooked to perfection! Noodles were cooked to the right point and the presentation of these portions were also AMAZING!   I will definitely be going back. The live entertainment was also sweet, sensuous, and welcoming. Excellent you guys.   Excellent!!!!",

Got the check & because they do not do separate checks we all calculated our portion of the bill. I ordered a $45 bottle of wine but when the bill was presented it showed $75. Brought it to the attention of the waitress & she said \"I presented the bottle to you\". I am sorry but if I order a bottle of wine I assume she is presenting the one I ordered! We asked for the wine list & pointed to the one we ordered. The one she presented to us was three selections down. She took our complaint to her boss & she referred it to the top boss. His response was \" well that table over there could say the same thing & they would be out $30 dollars.\" They took $15 off the check but it wasn't enough. Wine is marked up 100%, management would have broken even but they ruined the evening. There are too many great restaurants in Las Vegas to spend your  money here!",

Meatball sandwich was great- good meatballs and sauce.   I tried the pasta and house gravy (tomato sauce) and while it was good, it wasn't my style. While I enjoy spicy and hot food, I like my pasta sauce sweeter- so it's not that the sauce isn't good, it is just not my style. It was more like an arrabiata, or fra diavolo IMO.   Our waitress was really great. She was fun and did a good job. Cute too. ;-).   Atmosphere was neat. Kind of like a speakeasy. Red vinyl booths, dark ambiance with music like Sinatra and the like.   When you enter, they first talk to you through a little portal in the wall---- there is a surprise- so spoiler warning - don't scroll down if you don't want to know-  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  Spoiler Alert!  ----  The door is fake! They open a hidden door where the pay phone is to let you in!   Overall, I liked the place and would definitely come back.",

I told the waitress we had a groupon in the beginning (do not tell them until the end as some other yelpers have mentioned) because our waitress made us wait throughout the whole time since we were sat.  We were in a party of 6.  The busser are way more attentive and I actually just wanted to tip them instead.  At the end of our meal we waited 10 mins. to get the check and 20 mins. for her to even pick it up since she was too busy sitting at the bar talking to Mr. Grumpy doorman.     Waitress disappeared again, we asked for another waitress to get a manager for us to speak to.  I guess she told our waitress, because she came out claiming she was the manager herself.  Fine, I told her that it all makes some sense now since you are the manager, probably have other responsibilities other than checking on your tables.    I wouldn't come here again even if the meal was going to be given to me free.  The service was just terrible.  Worst of the worst.",

    "text": "Dined at Capo's on Tuesday night because I have always heard about this place and saw that on Tuesday nights they have a Locals deal.  First off, the place is really cool even from the moment you walk inside. Totally 1920's dark ambiance, mobster themed and it was really different and fun. They have a gentleman singing live music from the 1920's and a magician going around to the tables. It was a fun and unique dining experience. The only downside was having to wait almost 20 minutes for a table we had a reservation for.  As for the food, the table bread sucked which you would expect it to be at least warm and tasty from an Italian restaurant. Our server was very nice and I ordered a glass of wine which he forgot to put in and gave me two glasses for the price of one (Ill take a late drink any day for that). All entrees come with a soup or salad. Our server recommended the Cesar salad which I thought was sub-par and my entree actually came with an additional cesar salad on the plate with it so I would have preferred if he told me that and I would have gone with a soup as a starter instead.   I had just watched a food network or travel channel show on off-menu special items in Las Vegas. Capo's has a secret menu item called \"Leftovers\" and it looked amazing on the show. So I ordered it. It was a really interesting dish and I can see why it is called the Leftovers. Its a grilled chabbata and cheese bread on the bottom with a mountain of sausage and sauce covering the bread with two fried eggs on top. I thought it was delicious. My husband ordered the chicken parm and it was so yummy I will probably get that next time.  Overall, very cool place with good food. We will definitely be back, but most likely on Tuesday night because its a good deal.",

    "text": "After seeing the show Mystery Diner on the Food Network my wife and I made the decision to eat there on our upcoming trip to Las Vegas.  With three days to go before the vacation I purchased a Groupon that was 30 dollars for 60 dollars worth of food.  We made a reservation for 6:00 on Sunday because we wanted to eat early before we went out.    We showed up about 10 minutes after 6 because the valet was a little behind at our hotel.  After pushing the button and waiting a minute or two the little window was opened and we were asked if we had a reservation.  I told him my name and he let us in.    After we got inside, the restaurant itself was extremely dark and the gentlemen who opened the door said we were late and we would be punished by having to wait longer.  \"Whatever\" we didn't care, we were just hungry.  It was kind of funny when we sat down and I looked at the menu on the back it said that reservations would be held for 15 minutes.    When we sat down we were given two menus with little lights attached to help us read them.  After a couple of minutes the server came and told us about the specials.  I was very interested in the meatball and shrimp special and my wife was going to get another shrimp dish that was on the menu.  After we told the server that we were using a Groupon she said we had to spend the full sixty dollars which we didn't think would be a problem.  We needed another minute to decide so the waitress left and came back a minute later.    I was excited about my shrimp and meatball special especially after reading all the review on Yelp about how good their meatballs were.    When the waitress returned the first thing she said was \"sorry we are all out of shrimp,\" this meant I couldn't get my special and my wife couldn't get her selection.   Now how is it that you have a special and that consists of shrimp and you somehow run out of it by 6:15 at night.    I think that since we were using a Groupon they didn't want to sell us the shrimp , I have no proof but I think it was bullshit.    So we had to take another couple of minutes to look over the menu which had mostly dishes that contained shrimp.  I decided on spaghetti Alfredo with a meatball side, and my wife went with a clam dish in a red sauce.  When I the meal came my Spaghetti Alfredo had absolutely no flavor at all.  It was horrible.  The meatball on the other hand was really good.  My wife's clam dish was also very good and there was quite a bit of clams in the dish, which was exactly what she wanted.    After we finished and asked for our check the waitress came back and said we were a few dollars short of sixty and we were going to have to get something else.  My wife decided to get a dessert and she chose a tiramisu which ended up also being pretty good.  It tasted like they used real lady fingers and the whipped cream was also dynamite.  Overall our experience was not what we expected and we will not be going back here next time we were in Vegas.  The atmosphere was neat but I just can't fathom a restaurant that runs out of shrimp that is their special for the night by 6:15 in the evening.",

    "text": "We had heard about Capo's on the TV show Man Finds Food before our trip to Vegas and it looked like a lot of fun (and the food reviews were very good). Capo's did not disappoint!  One note: it's a $50 cab ride from the Strip ($25 each way), but it was worth it, as the cost for a full dinner and drinks was about half what you'd pay in Strip restaurants.  This place is a hoot -- you have to ring a bell and then you're asked for a password to be let in (like the old Speakeasy's - very fun) The restaurant is VERY dark, especially coming from the Vegas sun -- it's dark and very cozy with lots of half-booths. The decor is fun, photos of gangsters and Sinatra's mugshot.  There is a singer doing lounge songs, and he's pretty good! Our waiter, Bruce, was great -- his personality fit the place perfectly. He gave us recommendations for dinner and wine.  For appetizer, we went with the bruschetta, which was very good. The bread was thin and toasty/crunchy and absorbed the yummy tomato topping, it was very light.  For dinner, hubby got the shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta -- the sauce was tasty, but the shrimp were over-cooked which was sad because the pasta was perfect.  I went with the recommendation of the chicken marsala with mushroom risotto -- it was just excellent and so delicious, a great combo together. The chicken was so tender you could cut with a fork and the marsala was thick and full of flavor. The risotto was a perfect match.  I am an Italian from Boston and I have not had a better Italian meal in the North End.  As we had ordered our apps, Hubby said \"I know that waiter, we have seen him before\" and then we realized that he had served us at the Range at Harrah's a few years back -- he had a personality that leaves a positive impression. We asked him and sure enough it was the same guy! He was thrilled that we had remembered him, he spent a few minutes telling us about what happened with the Range and how he ended up at Capo's. What a sweet guy, so genuine - he said he was so happy that we remembered him and you could tell he really meant it.  What a great experience - we will be back.  The only reason it's not 5 star is because of the over-cooked shrimp, other than that it was spot-on perfect!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, but the poor service, long delay of our food, and overall neglect of my table made for a disappointing experience.   I think the secret door is a cool idea in theory and I love the entire Italian mob theme of this restaurant but I think asking if people have reservations and then making it seem like an inconvenience to seat you if you don't isn't smart business. We showed up before 4 pm and the host staff innocently argued in front of us about being unsure if they could seat us in the restaurant that had one table with people sitting at it.   My partners beer showed up ten minutes after we ordered it and we waited a solid thirty minutes for my eggplant parmigiana and his sausage and peppers. My dish was good, and a very large portion which I was happy to see for the hefty $21 price, but the sausage and peppers were overly salty for my taste.  We didn't see our server too much, she was busy tending to a larger party that was seated after us. Our water lacked refills, we weren't checked on after our dinner was dropped off, and when we asked for a dessert menu she dropped off a closed book but when we opened it there was no menu inside. She didn't come back for 10 minutes so we decided to not even order anything because it would have taken even longer.   I would like to come back for the live music, but it will probably be later then sooner.",

    "text": "I saw this restaurant on a reality tv show and was dying to try it while in Vegas. We made a reservation and grabbed a taxi from the strip (approximately $28 cab fare plus tip).  We had read about the entrance to the restaurant on yelp so knew what to expect. No disappointment there!  Once inside the VERY dark restaurant the host pointed to a booth and said \"sit over there\".  We found him quite humorous.   The food was great and the restaurant provides mini flashlights inside the menu so you can read it in the dark. Took us a while to realize this so we were using our phones at first. We had lasagna and cheese ravioli. My husband thought it was possibly the best lasagna he had eaten... And we eat out a lot.  The portions are large and served with soup or salad and bread. They have a man singing Frank tunes who comes to your table and sings and a magician who also comes to your table and does magic tricks (he didn't make it to our table. We enjoyed the musician very much.   When we were ready to leave the mob-like host/manager/owner (not exactly sure who he was) said his driver would take us back for a flat fee of $25. The driver was a very nice Russian (I think) man who my husband enjoyed talking to (I couldn't understand a word he said). Total cost for the dinner for my husband and I (including 1 glass of wine and desert), taxi fare, and generous tip was $150. Defiantly worth it!",

    "text": "GREAT CONCEPT; BAD EXECUTION  The idea of the Speakeasy style restaurant dining is great. The dining experience itself: not so much.  I had to laugh when reading \"Steakhouse\" on the menu because there just weren't that many steak options. Shrimp caught my eye in a few dishes, and the clams did also. We'd heard great things about the meatballs but I wanted seafood. It's an Italian place, right? Seafood and pasta sound easy enough.  Unfortunately, by 6 in the evening they were out of shrimp.  Choice number 2 wasn't a bad one though. I had the \"Gallows with clams\" in a red sauce. It was good and had a lot of clams. The sauce was tasty. Would have been good if I'd shared it over my husband's alfredo, because that was terrible. Flavorless sauce.  His meatball however was excellent. And very large; and tender! Exploding with flavor inside! I doubt we'll return here but it was fun to check out! I'd go with my clams again and he'd probably throw a meatball on top and share.  :)  A salad with a red sauce preceeded dinner and was very good. (Husband disliked the sauce). A tiramisu dessert finished up the evening and it was great too!  We had a Groupon but it still wasn't an inexpensive dinner, for what it was. You're partly paying for the experience though. It was fun dining in the dark. Service has room for improvement! We first heard about the place from a fake reality show that supposedly took place there. I wish Food Network would stop airing that crap, but I'm glad we had a chance to check out one of the places it supposedly featured!   If this restaurant fails I highly suggest the owner start a meatball production factory - freeze 'em and ship out! You have a guaranteed customer in California waiting for this day!",

Although I made the reservation 2 weeks before prom, I was called a week before my prom in order to confirm. In which I learned that they could not provide the number of checks needed even though within my 6 email correspondence with the \"reservationists\" I was told that all would be fine and taken care of. My main problem was with the miscommunication of the staff, but when I went to the general manager/owner, Dominic, he suffered a lack of communication as well. And even told me that even though I made the reservation a week ago, that he had not entered it into the computer and therefore my reservation, made two weeks before the date was not made at all. As a young teenage girl I was appalled by the way he raised his voice at me over the phone verbally attacking me. When I expressed that I felt he was being rude, he further screamed at me and dropped our reservation.   A previous customer of Capos I throughly enjoyed the atmosphere which is why I wanted to share the experience with my friends on my prom night. But unfortunately I was screamed at by a man twice my age over the phone. The atmosphere sadly doesn't feel welcoming anymore.",

The place is dark, you get mini flashlights to look at the menu. The menu online was not the same as what we were given.   Service was so slow, maybe the service staff congregating. Thanks to the busser/ service assistant for at least refilling our drinks and replenishing our bread. The kitchen that is in sight of the tables lack a sense of urgency needed to provide a speed of service to turn the tables, maybe that explains the manager/host seemingly stressed out whisking in the dining room and out again with no purpose but to see we were all hungry staring about and doing little about correcting it.  Food was enjoyable portion size smaller than that of most Italian restaurants I have visited. It stopped me from over eating and feeling stuffed, so I was okay with it. Service was slow to pay, watching your server having drama with staff, the bartender going off about something, I now understand why it  is kept so dark.   I would go again, but not for a dressed up celebration dinner. Maybe take out because service was so slow.",

    "text": "I think Capo's deserves a 2.5 because of originality, but since the stars won't allow, and due to a big-time let down and poor quality, I'll round down.  My Dad was in town for his 60th Birthday and he wanted Italian food for a less than outrageous price.  We can be pretty picky with Italian food considering we are Italian, and the fact that we come from where Italian food is actually good (NY,Philly,NJ).  He suggested Maggiano's because we know to expect good quality.  I didn't want to take him to a chain though, I wanted him to have something he could only get in Vegas, so I did my homework on Yelp, and Capo's seemed like the right choice.  A choice I ended up regretting.  No horror stories here, but as you will read, the service and food quality just weren't there, the only thing good was the atmosphere.  Upon arrival the entry and speakeasy theme was pretty cool.  Would have been cooler without a sign that said credit cards were currently not accepted, cash only.  But still pretty cool. Inside, the very dark environment with mafia decor and old Italian Resaurante style kept me looking around.  And an the old Vegas style lounge singer was belting out the Sinatra hits in a voice slightly better than my own (this is not a compliment to my voice).  From here it just goes down hill.  There was a half hour wait even though an entire room of tables was wide open, not being used.  I didn't realize we'd need a reso being it was a Tues night during the off-season and the place being in a hole in the wall off the beaten path.  Perhaps this was still my fault.  The service was bad.  Friendly enough, sure.  But we didn't get the water we asked for, and even after ordering we never got a basket of bread until such a long time went by that we waved down the waitress and begged for bread and water.  Then the bread came, and had I not been starving, I would have tossed it in the garbage.  This was possibly the worst bread I have ever tasted.  Is it possible for bread to be that bad?  Apparently it is.  Not just bad, but terribly stale.  I gobbled up the chewy, stale loaf anyway because I was so hungry from waiting, nearly ripping out teeth in the process.  The main course eventually came and it was all sub-par.  Edible, yes.  In an Olive Garden quality kind of way, maybe a bit worse.  The fettuccine alfredo seemed like it was straight outta the TV dinner box.  The added shrimp were a nice size.  My Dad got ravioli's in a red sauce with meatballs.  Again, just edible.  Especially since we were starving.  But a very generic taste all around.  I honestly felt embarrassed that I brought my Pop to eat this.  This is not a True Italian place.  It is a gimmicky eatery that makes it on its speakeasy theme atmosphere.  If you have ever had real Italian food, the taste of this food will be a total let down.",

All that being said, I think that with little kids, the earlier, the better for the restaurant, parents and customers.  We had a perfect time.  I wish I could remember what we all had, but too much time has gone.  What I do remember is that EVERYTHING my family ate was wonderful.  It's almost as if we hadn't ever been to an Italian restaurant before and were just discovering how delicious it could be.  Drinks, appetizers and entrees were all very tasty and plentiful.  No one had room for desert, darn it.    My adult kids drink tons of iced tea, and their glasses were never empty.  The service was some of the best I have experienced without being obtrusive.

The workers were extremely rude & then we asked to speak to the manager. He would not accept the groupon because it said it was for four ppl but the other couple canceled last minute. The groupon for 2 people cost less money but we wanted to spend a lot more than the 2 person deal but the manger refused.  So let me get this straight.....you're telling me you don't want our business? Especially since we told you we'd like to spend a lot more than the 2 person deal? Why does it matter how many ppl are dining if we just told you we'd like to spend so much more money?  RIDICULOUS  On top of that he tried to swindle us into paying waaaay more if we wanted to stay & dine. He was the rudest manager I've ever met in my life. He had an attitude the entire time & was extremely unfriendly. He basically said its our fault that we can't follow the rules.  It's ironic that I'm writing such a negative review because we initially decided to eat here after reading the positive reviews on yelp....but this was by far an awful experience.  After we left we went to Craftsteak in MGM GRAND & spent 3 times as much because we knew we'd get better service & the best food guaranteed.",

We cam here on a Wednesday night around 10:15 and ordered the mushroom caps and the ravioli with a side of meat ball.  The meat ball was very flavorful and tender, the ravioli was huge and had tons of diced Italian sausage in the sauce.  The mush room caps were good as well.

When the issue was brought up, they agreed to accept 4 cards, all others needed to pay cash.  I won't speculate on reasons for this policy but we didn't have cash and we weren't one of the ones needing a receipt, so we left. We are very disappointed as we have introduced a significant number of people to this restaurant.  We can no longer recommend them based on their inability to accommodate business needs. We are searching for a new Italian restaurant that we can recommend to out of town diners.",

    "text": "First, the main reasons they didn't get 4 stars... it was so dark in there, we couldn't see where we were walking nor did their tiny flashlight work well on my menu, its battery was dying and it wouldn't stay lit.  Also, we were seated right next to the singer and, while he was good, it was rather intrusive to be so close to him.  Lastly, while the food was good.. it wasn't stupendous.  Now, for what we liked.. the ambiance (other than the lighting) was good.  Service was great.  Food was good.  Prices seemed reasonable.  And.. the singer was staying in key most of the time.  We ordered the antipasto - rather excellent.  Our salads (with italian dressing) were boring afterwards, a bit too much lettuce since the antipasto was a salad also.  The bread was good, but they were stingy with the butter.  My entree was \"The Chef Sleeps with the Fishes\", a shrimp fettucine that I liked.  Hubby's entree was \"Angels with Dirty Faces\", angel hair pasta with pepperoni, peas, mushrooms & pink sauce.. also good.  We had enough leftovers for a couple more meals also.  Would we return?  Sure.  Would we get all quivery with anticipation for returning?  Nah.",

We will definitely bring visitors back here, it was fun, something different. Loved the way they greet you at the entrance. The light transition was a little hard to take, it took about 15 minutes for our eyes to adjust. We also weren't attended right away, but once we said something, we had great service from then on. Loved the old Las Vegas feel and the live singing. The wine list was decent. We had the meatball appetizer which was the best I've ever had. Our salads were all really good. The entrees were very generous and tasty. Lisa was our server and very friendly and helpful. Try it, you'll like it!",

I don't really wanna give away the experience. But you should make reservations if you go on a weekend. It definitely is a possibility it may be crowded - It opens at 5pm till late night.  Ok so here's the deal without giving away the experience. You walk in and .............. We'll skip ahead to eating there - it definitely is worth it though. Funny thing is that I was reading over some past reviews and either people had a great time here or it REALLY Sucked. Sometimes restaurants go through staffing issues...But definitely had a good time here. Just remember to \"speak easy\" if you know what I mean! The ambiance is dark and romantic. With an old Vegas feel to it. It's got these private booths and family tables. We got the Bugsy Segal Booth. There's a guy walking around singing old Rat Pack/Chicago -Italian style songs from \"That's Amore\" - \"Ain't that a kick in the head.  The service was friendly from EVERYONE! The decor is kinda Mob-like. The food was pretty good almost home cooked. The pasta I had was \"Swim with Fishes\" or something like that had a light cheese cream sauce with garlic and sundried tomatoes swimming in al dente fettucinni and shrimp.  \"Bust a cap\" stuffed mushrooms were fantastic - sure they were little mushrooms but they did pack it with flavor. The italian egg drop soup was good. Very garlicky but a little salty for me. When they say garlic mashed potatoes...they don't mess around. GARLIC!!!! They had this chicken too kinda with picatta sauce and capers but it had broccoli. This thing was packed with flavor. Ok so great ambiance,  great date place, friendly staff, good food. Definitely wanna come back!",

Unfortunately, upon arrival I had my doubts simply based on the outside appearance, but my Mom always told me never to judge a book by its cover. I should have trusted my instict. I ordered the stuffed rigatoni. Although I cannot be positive, I suspect they were frozen and mass produced. They tasted a lot like a bland frozen dinner. My husband ordered the Sausage and Peppers. There was nearly no sausage and very minimal peppers. After Not finishing our food, I decided we would give the establishment a chance to redeem itself with dessert. We ordered the Cannoli. I was pleasantly surprised. The shells were crisp, the filling was smooth and sweet but not overly sweet. For the price and review on the Food Network I was expecting a much better experience. We will not be returning.",

    "text": "Ok, I read all of your blogs and comments before taking on this experience. Overall I have seen mixed reviews about this restaurant ranging from as high as 4 stars to as low as 1 star. My wife and I went here on Monday 25 Apr 2011 as a pre-celebration to my 42nd birthday. We had a 6:00 pm reservation and valet parked at the location. The reservation was honored and my vehicle was parked right in the front of establishment.  We have lived within Las Vegas since 2003 and have roots to the Midwest. I am from Chicago (truly a city kid, Southside, and White Sox fan) and my wife is from St. Louis. Service was fantastic, the hostess was very prompt with our meals, checked just enough to see if we required any additional service however, allowed us to hold a conversation with each other. Ziggy was the manager that night and ran a classy shift. Service is a 9.5 out 10 because there is always room for improvement. We were allowed to choose our seat and the crowd was about moderate size. Bummer that night no live piano, that would have made for a perfect night. Instead we had to listen to various big band, R&B, and top 40 dinner music.  I had the meatballs with spaghetti for dinner and my wife had the steak, she likes her steak overcooked. The meatballs were ok, not the best that I have ever had coming from a Black, Irish, Italian, and Germany neighborhood on the Southside of Chicago however, merited a 7 out 10. The sauce with the meatballs was the bomb, 9 out 10. I make my sauce from scratch and my wife and I almost did not get together because the first time that she cooked spaghetti with red sauce she tried using that crap in the jar and I asked her if she was making spaghetti for the dog. Lol now, but was not funny then. The steak was ok, I like my steak with pink inside so to me the steak lacked flavor, but as I said in the beginning my wife likes her steak overcooked. For desert we shared a generous serving of the tiramisu on the patio, I would go back just for the tiramisu. This was better than any tiramisu that I have had in Chicago or New York, I went to college within Saratoga Springs and Albany with many weekend trips to New York City. Overall, the food is a 6.5 out 10.  The lighting in the restaurant is dark, which I enjoyed very much. After 10 minutes or so your night vision will set in and you can easily see your meal and the person sitting across from you. Until then use the mini flash lights or the light from you cell phone. The dim light avoids rubber necking at the patrons around you and eyeballing their man, girl, and food. You have to actually look at, talk, and listen to the person that you came to the restaurant with, what a concept. Do not bring a grenade to this affair as you will be hurting. This dime eye candy action. You can barely see the people sitting at the tables around you, all you see are shadows. The True purpose and setting of a speakeasy duh............. This is not some entertainment ride or want to be speakeasy, as my wife said this is the True deal.  I found the place very romantic with a little bit of curiosity and mystery. My wife was very surprised by the door hide at the entrance. This made for a fun evening and met my expectations. Though the price is moderate $100 for two (includes one alcohol drink for each, meals for two, and one shared desert) the location, food, and ambience is not equivalent. However, you are paying to be in a speakeasy (private club) therefore, you should expect a higher price for everything in order to keep out the riff raff. If I had to explain that to you before you understood how a speakeasy works this place is not for you. Stick with olive garden or some other franchise Italian restaurant.   My wife and I will definitely return to this restaurant with adult friends and look forward to our next trip there. I hope that this helps all and has some street cred for those of you that can read between the lines. This is not the place to bring anyone that is under the age of 15. Even then I believe that company here is best to keep at the age of 21 and older. Oh not sure about the place on Trop but location on Sahara is good to go.",

First of all, we had made reservations but when we got there, they were not ready for us- the front door was open so we didn't get to experience the BIG entrance everyone talks about.  Then, it took the hostess forever to find us a seat even though the restaurant was pretty empty.    The ambience of the restaurant which people say are \"in keeping with the theme\" I feel is kind of an excuse for it being so...... let's just say it's DEFINITELY old vegas.  The food is really heavy and unsettling- there's nothing special about it and it's definitely over-priced for its quality.  To top it all off, our waiter was an a$$.... I really think he was intoxicated, he couldn't pay attention to us when we were ordering and kept forgetting things...   SOOOOO not worth the drive from the strip...",

Getting in was fun with the speakeasy entrance but then...  Being steered to our table in a very dark place we were seated and began ordering drinks.  It was so dark that mini flashlights were attached to menus.  Food was average, service not so much.  We asked for an extra bread basket and, reluctantly, they placed an empty breadbasket on the table.  The price was not as advertised; instead they took $10 off each meal.  After carefully calculating the receipt the next day (because it was way too dark to read it at Capo's), I discovered we overpaid $19.70.  Also, I asked the waiter to include the tip and he kindly awarded himself 20% -- a little high for the service received.  Sadly, I will not return.  The idea is terrific and it could be fun, except for what I have mentioned above.  Also, I guess I am concerned about what it looks like when the lights are on.",

When we arrived (slightly on the early side for dinner bc we had a Cirque show to catch) the lot was empty and not a soul in site. When we entered, it was dark and the front door was locked so we rang the buzzer. Quickly a speak easy opened to our right and an Italian chap said, \"state your business\"...fumbling over our words we managed to spit out \"we would like to have dinner if you're open\". He slams the window shut and minutes later the front door opens and he says, \"follow me\". We had no idea this was part of their shtick. It was so dark inside that our eyes were having a hard time adjusting. Once they did, we immediately felt like we were tossed back into the good ole brat pack days. There was a gentleman singing Sinatra and Martin songs. The good was great. We ordered Caesar Salad, carbonara, and their meatballs which were the best we've had. Ask about the cooking process and you'll understand why. Great sangria too. The service was incredibly attentive. We've sent many people here and they too all love the shtick at the door as well as the food and ambiance. Well worth the cab ride over.",

From the moment you walk in the door till the moment you leave the place gives you a feel like you are in the middle of an Italian mob movie. I liked how it was dark in there it really set the mood, and the little lights connected to your menu to see it better. I loved it. We got there a bit late and were the only ones in the place which was fine. The service was exceptional. He ordered a captain and coke which tasted like a glass of captain and a drop of coke (always good). First came the bread and the garlic butter that came with it was what made the bread awesome, it would have been nothing special with out it. Then the salads, I got the house salad with Italian dressing. It was honestly the best house salad ever, it had marinated tomatoes and artichoke hearts on it and the dressing was incredible. I ordered Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata, just the right amount of spicy for a pasta dish. I loved it. He ordered the Alfredo and bragged about how awesome it was all night.",

I tried calling several times for reservations only to be HUNG UP ON TWICE. When we get to the restaurant without reservations on a Saturday at 5pm, we were treated like crap and was recommended to sit at the bar instead. (My sister made sure he knew we tried to call ahead.) We gladly sat at the bar since we were starving, but had to wait forever for our food. It was not crowded yet, but I think our server forgot to put in our entire order. One dish out of three was ready and served. We could see our possible lasagna dish ready from where we sat, but the third dish wasn't. When one of the cooks looked at a ticket, he said \"f***\" out loud and then we heard him say chicken Parmesan which was our third dish. By the time I got my dish, my pasta was cold and undercooked. I didn't not return my food because 1) it had already taken FOREVER to get the dish and  2) I was hungry and didn't want to wait any longer. I just didn't eat the pasta, but I let our server know of my displeasure. She just said \"okay\" and walked off.  Not pleased at all.",

    "text": "What an amazing find off The Strip! I can't believe I have not been here before. I was looking for a unique dining experience for a special birthday and Capo's delivered. From the outside it may look unassuming and in a strip mall across the street from a bunch of dealerships. Inside though, is a speak easy joint reminiscent of the mob days in Vegas. Secret passwords, secret doors, and a guy with a heavy Italian accent-I love it! You walk in and it is dark, but like intimate and cozy kind of dark. Fresh lobster tank in the front after the secret door when you walk in, bar with a full staff making drinks to the right, and escorted to my table by a wonderful gentleman who was professional and was a no frills kind of guy. Was very efficient in getting the groups and couples coming in for dinner right away. We sat in a cozy black velvet booth and there was a piano man singing Dean Martin's, \"Luck Be a Lady\". Wonderful singing. He said hello to the crowd and got to my table and dedicated a song once he found out it was for a birthday. Sang \"Unforgettable\". Classy.   The servers were absolutely friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt. Ordered the cheese bread and calamari for appetizers. The cheese bread comes in 4 or 8 pieces. Server recommended the 8 pieces, so we went for it. The cheese bread comes out piping hot with a thick layer of melty cheese on a well seasoned thick bread. Served with a side of marinara sauce. So good! The calamari was tender, lightly breaded and served with lemon slices and a red dipping sauce. Not greasy and really tasty. For the main entree, ordered the spaghetti and meatball and Fettecini Alfredo with chicken. The chicken costs extra, but was worth it. It was grilled and was a good size in proportion to the dish itself. I also had the Faggoli soup which was light and tasty.  Portions are great. Sharable really, but it's so good you may not to or you could take the rest to go. You get one very big meatball for the spaghetti dish and it was vey moist, flavorful, and delicious. The fettuccine Alfredo with chicken was rich, creamy, and buttery. Went well with the glass of wine. There was even a magician that performed some magic at our table too! Was very talented and engaging. Heard about a magician at the restaurant, but did not believe it. So we got a dinner and a show-loved it!  Overall, this place is a hit! Service is exceptional, food is solid Italian classic, and the whole experience is just outstanding. Highly recommend!",

We ordered garlic bread and found it came in slices with melted cheese on it.  I had ordered eggplant Parmesan.  Eggplant Parmesan is typically made in thin slices of eggplant, with sauce and cheese on top - this came rolled up with a dollop of sauce and then cheese.  I didn't finish my meal and ended up leaving it.  The next day we went to Roma Deli II on Spring Mountain.  it was wonderful!  We won't be going back to Capo's.",

At first you're kind of confused as to how to enter but as soon as you press the door bell you are greeted by someone through a secret window and enter through a secret door. Already started off with a bang! Our server was Brandon. Highly suggest asking for him, he was super funny and very attentive. The food came out within perfect times. Didn't feel overwhelmed whatsoever.   Highly suggest trying their calamari, it melts in your mouth and the sauce isn't overwhelming. I ordered there spaghetti and meatballs, which is what their known for. Their tomato sauce is truly one of a kind. Though I wasn't fond of the meatball because of the rosemary, everyone else at my table thought it was fantastic.   We came for my step dad's birthday. I told the host earlier in the evening we have a celebrant. At the end we ordered the dessert and the live singer sung happy birthday which really topped it off. The homemade cannoli's are to die for!!!!! As soon as I finished I wanted more. Overall the experience was great and everyone there is so welcoming. For sure coming back!",

I also think that the wine list could use a little improvement...there are better wines to compliment the good food!

There for a friend's Roaring Twenties themed birthday celebration, the whole secret entrance element made it feel that much more authentic. Being a girl who loves her high heels, it was a bit difficult to adjust to the darkness of the space *whilst* walking to my table. I pretty much had to go on faith that the floor was even and no table or chair legs were sticking out. I wasn't entirely lucky, as I twisted my ankle slightly when there was a change in the floor right as we were entering our private room. This may need to be addressed. Perhaps the host can provide a small light as we follow them?   Aside from that mishap, I adored the restaurant. The atmosphere was lovely. I enjoyed the added movie entertainment in our room. The food was DELICOUS! I ordered the Nico Caesar with chicken. It was good. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Not something that happens all the time in salads. I also sampled the fried ravioli. Amazing! As well as the lava cake which was divine!  Our server was very pleasant. A bit disheveled at times, but he made it work.  I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience. I look forward to returning to try more!",

My chicken piccata was VERY lemony. All in all the food tastes a bit like olive garden and it was a bit too pricey for that. But I did however really enjoy the red sauce. Nice place to go if looking for a unique experience off the strip.",

As we had been there previously with them and had a wonderful meal and a great time we thought sharing the experience would be fun, and we knew what to expect, or so we thought. You enter the establishment thru a \"hidden\" door and the experience begins. The atmosphere is very Rat Pack, \"mob themed\" and is kitschy, but not kitschy in a tacky way. The decor is very dark and moody, and there are several booths if you are looking for a romantic mood. Everyone in our group ordered drinks, wine and appetizers and we sat back enjoying each other's company and listening to a live piano player playing Rat Pack songs. (There had been no live entertainment the first time we went here, so we were very happy). After our soup & salad were served, the most charming young man came up to the table and performed close up magic tricks! He goes by the name of \"The Magic of V\", and using cards, coins and simple rubber bands he amazed us while waiting for our entrees.  I had the \"Angels with Dirty Faces\", which is Angel hair pasta with peas, mushrooms & pepperoni,  tossed with Capo's pink sauce, and I added an Homemade Italian \"Meatless\" Meatball, that you couldn't tell the difference. Ed had the \"Gotti's Chicken Angelo\" Chicken breast sauteed with artichoke hearts, roasted red potatoes & mushrooms in a lemon white wine sauce. It was fantastic! We did take home a \"Jimmy Two Times\" Tiramisu, as we're so full...Tonight with coffee after dinner Ed & I will share it. All the dinner portions were so generous, that none of us really felt like desert, but who turns down homemade Tiramisu! Capo's is a can't miss spot for taking visitors, and a for a romantic night out with your favorite someone. Worth making reservations, worth every penny we spent!",

When I came in for lunch, they sat only my me and my granny at a table for 6 in the center of the dinning. Which I thought was weird since everyone else were sat at the booths.   Before I even sat down, the guy asked me if I'm here on a voucher. No? So he made us feel like we we couldn't afford eating here without a voucher. Whatever I still looked up that voucher though and bought it since he mentioned it hehe! Then servers were only attending the people around us and we felt like we were being ignored. I had to give them a pissed off eye to order from them. My grandmas visiting from Shanghai and she asked me if they were being rude to us because we're Chinese! That made me furious.   I ordered the spaghetti and carbonara and both were amazing! The garlic salad also was good and had a nice cream dressing. After we starting eating, I noticed we didn't get a bread basket? Everyone else did but not us.   I asked the guy if we had to buy a bread basket or something and he told me it's by request. IVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE. Especially from an Italian restaurant. I've been to $$$$ Italian places and never have I ever had to ask for a bread basket. It's like going to a Korean restaurant and requesting banchan.   I honestly love the food here but the service really made it a bad time for us.",

You need reservations and you also need a password to get in. We emailed about a reservation and got a response within hours to 'text AuntieG, she'll hook you up.'  Not going to lie - I was intimidated!  But I did it and that's where the amazing service and experience began. AuntieG texted me to confirm a time and to give me my password  We arrived and were greeted by a little sliding window. We stated our name, gave our password and we were welcomed in like family. We waited a few minutes to get our seat (AuntieG told us to arrive a little later than our original time to ensure a great seat.) We were seated with a fantastic server and amazing food followed. They are known for their meatballs - order them!!  The pasta fagioli soup - delicious. The live music was inviting and added to the ambiance. As far as dress, some folks were super dressy, some were casual - it's whatever you are feeling.  Do I suggest flip flops?  Probably not. We were texted a few days after our visit to ensure we had a great time. Go here. Go out on a ledge and experience the mob/speakeasy style!  You won't be disappointed",

I have been told of Capo's by several friends and family so when I finally moved here it was one of my first restaurants to try.  It gets quite busy here on any given night so reservations are a great idea! Don't forget to ask for the password. The entrance is on the back side of the restaurant right by the parking lot. Once you enter be prepared to share the password! Once inside it was like stepping into a different world. The restaurant is dimly lit with live entertainment (jazz singer) and smells deliciously of authentic Italian food.  My party of 3 did not have a reservation, so we had a seat at the bar. The bartender was very prompt and friendly. She made great drinks as well.   I started with the house salad with homemade Italian dressing, it was great! The dressing was very obviously homemade. On a future visit I would love to try a dinner/entree salad.  We were served warm bread with butter... yummy and great starter to the saucy meals.  My party and I were for warned that the portions are huge. With that advice I split Da Don's lasagna with my fiance and we still left with 1/2 of the lasagna. Which by the way was great reheated at home the next day. The lasagna was simply delicious! Great sauce, lots of cheese and nuggets of Italian sausage in between really satisfied our Italian craving!  We enjoyed the sauce so much we purchased some to take home. They have two varieties traditional and spicy. We purchased both and they run $7 a jar.  I am looking forward to visiting capo's again and trying more of their delicious food!",

Like stepping back in time. The hosts were wearing shiny Italian suits which really added to the mystique. Since I didn't have reservations I sat at the bar which was right next to the grill so I got to watch the meals being prepared. Great show. The food was some of the best Italian I've had. I ordered chicken piccata and it was delicious. Two breasts perfectly cooked and the sauce was freshly made. I know. I was watching. If you get a chance, try it. Capo's doesn't disappoint.",

Restaurants like Capo's Restaurant and Speakeasy are what make Vegas a popular destination.",

Doesn't taste anything like your regular chain Italian restaurant. The service is by far the absolute best. Everyone is very professional and friendly. My water glass was never empty for more than five minutes. Constantly checking up on you just to see how you like your food. Setting wise, it's great. It's dark inside, but that's the whole point. If you can't see the menu, use the flashlight that comes with it. There's a gentleman by the piano singing at dinner time. I thought he was lip syncing because it sounded so lovely. He's actually singing though. I go every time I'm in Vegas.   Tip: It is better to make reservations online because they get very busy at dinner time.",

No apology or offering another day or time. Just straight up hung up on me. I love the food here... but they need to replace or re-train their staff. Sadly disappointed",

Especially me!  It was my birthday.  We get greeted at the door and it was really cool. Very speak easy style which was the only good thing that happened.  We get sat right in front.  At 705.  We didn't receive menus till 20 minutes of sitting there.  Right after she hands us the menu, she wanted us to right then order our drink without looking at the menu.  We said give us a minute to look over the menu.  A minute doesnt mean 15 minutes.  At this point we almost walked out.  As we were about to get up she comes over and asks if we are ready to order.  We decided that maybe we will stay.  We saved our glasses of wine for our dinner.  When we get our dinner, we asked for pepper flakes from our waitress.  We didn't see her for another 10 minutes.  At this point we were done!!!  I go to the maiter'd to have a manager come to our table.  Our waitress comes over to see us and says they didn't bring you pepper flakes, I'll be right back. She brings the pepper flakes and then 2 minutes later a \"manager\" (You are no manager). A guy dressed in a server outfit comes to our table.  He apologizes and does nothing to help the situation.  All he did was comp off the glasses of wine we didn't touch because we wanted to drink it while we ate... Which we never did.  They boxed our food and we left.  Our waitress only got 10% tip due to the fact that I know she has to probably tip out other people.  They don't need to suffer for her lack of work.  As for the so called manager... You sir, if you are a manger, needs to figure out how to make this restaurant work.  I think your lack of customer service is a problem.  I believe re-training people and Truely understand how to make your guest feel special is key.  Especially on special occasions.",

The night we were there they had live singing, lots of Frank and Dean. Our food and drinks were fantastic. I had the Nico, two of my party had the Sucker Punch, and another had Mad Dog Manhattan. Everyone was happy with these. Our server recommended the meatball appetizer as they are \"known\" for them; you get two large meatballs served in their sugo sauce with peppers. These were flavorful and large enough for a party of four to share.  Entrees for the table included Eggplant Parmesan, the Alfredo, and the sausage and peppers (appetizer). All came with a salad (dressings were good). I loved the fact that with the eggplant you could order a side of risotto instead of pasta. The eggplant was good, but the risotto was amazing. Throw in some shrimp and I would want it for an entree!  Fun place, will definitely visit again.",

When you walk in there is this smell thay you just can't get passed I don't know if they are having some sort of plumming issues or what but there was a foul smell of body odor or urine and it was very unappealing and a bit hard to get out of my head. The singer has a great voice but the music is fairly loud and makes it difficult to carry on a conversation. It's dark and I understand that goes to the allure of the speakeasy theme but the lights on the menu are so bright that it really blinds you and makes it hard to read anything on the menu. The magician that came to the table put on a nice show but being that I was on a first date and he was a little sexual with my date made her feel uneasy and I think ruined the mood setting which wasn't very fun but he did do some cool illusions I will give him that. The food was great I really have no complaints in that regard I had the chicken anastasia which I would recommend to anyone that visits. I loved how They played off the mob theme at the door with the password and peephole and again the singer was great but just much to loud for a romantic setting the ambiance is nice and the decor is very fitting. I do not think I will be coming back I just can't get over that smell it was really awful but for the food alone I will give at least the two stars.",

Now, the food exceeded my expectations. The stuffed mushrooms are to die for! I ordered a penne dish that was absolutely delicious and the portion was huge! I will definitely be returning when I'm back in town.",

We were a table of 5 and were seated at the booth, with a lot of room area. The food was so good. We got fried calamari and a spicy sausage as our appetizers and then each got their own plate. I got the Vinnie's al vodka w/ a meatball and it was just so so so good! I love a meatball that cuts so easily and soft. The pasta had so much flavor. Our server, Jeanie was attentive and sweet. We had a great time and will definitely be back for the 2 for 1 Tuesdays! =)",

Who doesn't love being greeted with \"you got any weapons on you?\" When walking into a restaurant?  The food was decent, but the real draw of the place is the ambience and the nightly entertainment.  I didn't care much for sitting next to a couple of rude drunks insulting their \"dates\" culture all night, but Capo's can't be blamed for that. I will definitely return the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Love the speakeasy entrance, host and all. The mob theme is a little overdone. Love the singer and the ambiance. Service was excellent, except he never did come back with the Parmesan cheese. The food won't win any awards but it was filling and tasty. I did enjoy my mushroom risotto. Everyone enjoyed the food, just perhaps didn't love it. It's great for locals with the twoferone Tuesdays, and great to bring visitors for a fantasy prohibition era Vegas night out.",

I've never ordered spaghetti at a restaurant and I am so glad I changed it up, because the meatball and sauce were to die for. We sat at the bar and our server/bartender was great. At the end of the meal the GM Dominic bought us a round of drinks to top it off. Between the ambiance, hospitality, and amazing food and drinks you would be crazy to not come back!",

I loved the added entertainment value for the 21st birthday we were celebrating but it left me wanting more.  If the waitresses were in character similar to the host that would be the icing on the cake.    Great choice for a celebration, fun Vegas restaurant or honestly for a great meal. We were really glad we went.  The 21 somethings at our table thought it was a cool choice as well. Just 10 min from our hotel at the Mirage.   I recommend asking for an extra sauce on the side.  The alfredo, creamy garlic & marinara were awesome & the bread dips very well indeed.",

I know this place has live music too though. This fun mob italian place has huge portions! The people are nice & seem to know their menu. My pasta was delicious with lots of different italian toppings. Calamari plate itself would be good for 4 people. My boyfriend & I's bill was also good enough for 4 people (or more) LOL. The bread's butter is the best butter ever. It's like a honey butter. Also, beware of strong alcoholic drinks! I recommend this place if its anything like the old venue (Tropicana & Jones). It's a nice get-away from your stereotypical, Italian , mainstream restaurant.",

If you don't enjoy themed experiences, or have no sense of humor, you might not enjoy yourself here. It's a little bit irreverent, but totally fun, and very Vegas!  We were taken good care of by all the staff, we had great wine, great service and amazing food.   Their sugo is amazing, I can't stop thinking about it. Order the meatballs and peppers, OMG, I'm drooling just thinking about it!   They had great entertainers, and the personality of everyone there really added to our great time.   Would definitely recommend to friends!",
