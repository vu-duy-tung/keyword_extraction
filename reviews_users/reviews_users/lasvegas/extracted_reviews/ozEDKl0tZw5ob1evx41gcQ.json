I'm probably being a bit critical on the three stars here but it didn't quite round to 4.  The food was good but not amazing.  The service was average.  It was loud as hell and I could do without the smoke in the bar area.    I had a sirloin steak and my friend had fish/chips.  The steak was done correctly, not fatty, and the sides were decent.  At $17, whaddya expect.  My friend said his was good as well.  In the end, I wouldn't rush back but it definitely served the purpose.",

    "text": "The Draft House is very likable. It's the kind of bar you can hang out at for a while. During the day they have the barn open which is a separate restaurant area (especially good for those w/ kids). Food is served day & night, though if you're in there during late night hours, you'll receive a much smaller menu. The staff is exceptional. I haven't had a staff issue yet. They're friendly in the barn, they're friendly around the bar area. The graveyard bartender, Ty, is an especially cool guy. I've seen him running around like crazy when it's slammed & he still manages to keep us from going dry (even when we're sitting at a table away from the bar). The grave Chef is also pretty cool. They do brew their own beer & have a large board showing the current offerings.   They have certain regular brews as well as seasonal ones that appear from time to time. I will tell you up front - I actually hate beer. I'm truly not that fond of it. I'm a bit jealous of beer drinkers, really. They can just walk into a place & order a drink nice & easy-like. For a mixed drink it all depends on the bartender's skills & for wine, well, most places only stock the cheapest crap (plus it seems pretentious sometimes to try to be ordering wine in some establishments). So yeah, I'm jealous. I will say though, I can drink the beer here & it's pretty good. The best regular brew is certainly Red Hydrant. It goes down pretty easy & works w/ most any food there. The Black Lab Stout's pretty good (not as good as a Guinness, but pretty good) - it goes well w/ some hot chicken fingers. Several of my friends are quite fond of the Leglifter Light. It's a bit too light for me personally but didn't taste bad. Out of the seasonal brews, my favorites are probably the Raspberry Wheat & Cherry Wit. They run out a little too quickly though, so if you see them on the board, you have to try them then. No putting it off until next visit or they'll disappear on you. Rebel Red was another good seasonal one. It's always worth it to check out the board. They actually list beer pairing options on the menu. :)  On to the food - mostly good.   Garlic fries (smothered in garlic chunks - you'll smell like them for days), cheddar cheese curds w/ both horseradish & ranch sauces, sweet potato fries, chicken fingers - all great stuff. Grandma's Pot Roast Melt is very good - muenster cheese & horseradish sauce w/ au jus! Salads are huge & quite tasty.   Southwest Melt is tasty - it's a turkey & pepper jack affair w/ avocado (more on this below).  Wisconsin Steak Brat (a ribeye, a brat & mozzarella on a bun) is pretty good though the brat was a little bit salty for me. Fish & chips are decent. Burgers are great - I've discovered that I especially like the sauteed spinach on there. It turns it into a great garlicky gooey mess, but now that I've discovered it, I always get it. The Phillys are good. I especially like the Southwest Philly w/ poblano, pepper jack & avocado (below!) Breakfast foods are tasty as well.   The other side of things - there can be consistency issues sometimes, particularly between the day & night shifts. Apparently one of the daytime chefs likes to get a little chinzy with things. You'll order a philly that comes out w/ a perfectly respectable amount of meat at nighttime & you might get only 2/3 of that during the day. The avocado is a prime example of this. Ordering on the late night menu, the Southwest Philly will come w/ 2 kinda thin slices of avocado on each half of the sandwich. Not overkill like they're robbing the boss or something, but bun coverage. It's the proper amt when you see the sandwich. Now, order that during the daytime & you just might get only one paper thin slice per half. I once ordered avocado on my burger during the day. It's an extra buck to do so. When it came I got one of the thinnest slices of avocado I had ever seen - and only one, mind you, on this big ol' burger. I was like, really? I paid an extra buck for this?   Other less than pleasing things: I got the walleye broiled w/ citrus glaze once & it was seriously bland. I might try it one of the other ways that they serve it sometime. I've had the grilled chicken sandwich twice, once during the day & once at night. Both times it was dry & burnt so I dunno what's up w/ that one. Fillet Sliders & the Malibu Turkey Wrap are just ok. The only salad option on the late night menu (I think it's the Southwestern Steak) is just ok. On the late night menu there is some seriously good food, but not if you want to have something lighter. I'd like to see another option or two added for when I don't really want fried food & lots of meat which does happen sometimes.   So, this place gains a 4 from me primarily for service, atmosphere, & beer selection. Most of the food is good. Much of it is great. Now if they'd just fix the consistency issues & give me some damn avocado during the day when I order it, I could consider bumping them up some more.",

Great place for lunch with the wife. It covers all the bases. Beers are delicious, my fav is the Red Hydrant(?): kinda like a Newcastle with hints of toffee, YUM! Cheese Curds are deliciously greasy, garlic fries give you that wonderful hot-breath, and the Bratzel sandwich is amazing: Bratwurst on a Pretzel Bun, how can you go wrong?!? They also have lots of TV's, big-screen Golden Tee, and a nice internet jukebox.",

    "text": "Im a big micro-beer fan and was excited to try another Brewery while in Vegas. The beer was very average, and the service was also equally average.  Front of house had a major dive-bar feel to it and the brewery portion (separated by a glass window) appeared active but very cluttered and tight on space (despite the brew-side being in a large facility).  The place was very loud inside (there was a big game on, so rightfully so).  Only thing that really gave me pause was that the waitress had no idea what a \"flight\" was when taking our drink orders, kind of scared me for a minute seeing that this was a brewery. She was otherwise kind and helpful. I did have to chase her down to pay my bill though, but she seemed to be the only waitress",

    "text": "I am so, so, so sad that I did not try this place sooner. Looks are totally deceiving and i totally admit to thinking I was too cool to drink beer in a corny place designed to look like a barn. This place is in my backyard,..I can see it from my bathroom window and up until a few month sago avoided it like the plague.  A  few months ago a co-worked coaxed me into meeting her for a few beers here, so I gave in and drove across the street. The first thing I noticed upon entry (since I'm from Chicago) was the sickingly amount of Wisconsin/packers/ badgers signs and memorabilia. Oh great, I thought...not only am I drinking in a barn, but a cheesehead barn...lol (chicago folk loathe all wisconsin teams). Anyhoo... on to the food and drink,  I ordered cheese curds, a tall  tailwagger wheat brew and a full order of nachos..OMG is the food good...and the beer tastes like a midwestern weiss (my fave!) then came the 20 lb plate of nachos, I thought that was a mistake or a joke, the full plate of nachos could seriously feed 6 people. Then the bill came..surprise, SUPER CHEAP.  So now I absolutely love this place and eat & drink here at least once a week. My newest addiction here is the potroast sandwich. I LOVE this place...if you haven't tried Draft House , you don't know what your missing.",

This is one of the few local breweries in the city. To make it even better they brew their own Root Beer. So for you non-alcoholic drinking people out there I will tell you that it is truly a treat!  The food is a little above bar food. I might go a far to say it is almost gastro pub level food, but really they focus on burgers and brats. So it really isn't gastro pub level.  There are usually great specials either during football games and sometimes just during the week. Not that the prices are terrible normally but getti more food for y our dollar is certainly not a bad thing!",

I waved the inattentive sever down and told her my card was missing. \"Well, it wasn't there when I went to process it.\" So the search begins. She retraces her steps and after five minutes gives up. I begin calling my bank. Then from across the room some busser picks it up and gives it to the guest sitting next to him. HE GAVE MY CARD AWAY!!! The couple that he gave it to, got up and asked if there was someone missing their card. I wasn't expecting a free meal after this ordeal but it wasn't even offered. They asked me if I had a different form of payment before the card was found. You've gotta be kidding me! This was handled so poorly.

My husband got the post roast sandwich which was ok but nothing outstanding. He tried the sweet potato fries which were cold.   I got the philly which was a mess! I asked for no peppers which came in abundance. Took it back and brought out basically an onion sandwich with little to no meat. Disgusting.   The only thing I liked was their outdoor sitting area. Lots of shade, fans and great little outdoor eating area. If you take younger children or you have issues with smoke, I suggest you sit out here. Indoors is more casino and bar style although they do have a few tables on one side as their restaurant. The smoke from the bar/casino is definitely heavy throughout even in non-smoking areas.",

    "text": "There used to be a bevy of Big Dog's breweries around town. (My favorite was the Holy Cow Casino on the north end of the Strip, where I hit my first--and only--royal flush.) Now there's only one: the Draft House. And while it seems like it's there mainly for gaming, there's also food and drink on the menu.  We've been to the Draft House many times, and when we're there to eat, we usually dine in the restaurant. This time, we decided to sit in the bar, and while the service was excellent, it was so dark that we couldn't read the menu without whipping out my flashlight app.  My husband had the three-cheese burger, with swiss, pepper jack, and provolone. He said it was fine but nothing spectacular. He also swapped his fries for onion rings, which was a good move.  I opted for the cheeseburger pizza, which was topped with ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, and onion. Because of the limited light, I didn't notice until I got home that it also was drizzled with some type of sauce (like Thousand Island dressing). This combination was a little odd, and I didn't care much for it hot, but it tasted better cold the next day.  We each had two pints, so we sampled four different beers. We're both usually big fans of IPAs, but both of the IPAs we had were too flowery, and one of those was also a little skunky. The pale ale was not memorable at all, and our favorite of the four (the 44 Magnum) was actually a blend of two of their most popular beers: Dirty Dog IPA and Red Hydrant brown. That was a tasty beverage, and one I'd try again.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and the prices were reasonable. But overall, I wasn't too impressed with the food or beer. I have had good meals there in the past, and the Magnum was memorable, so I would still recommend the Draft House if you're in the mood for a quick bite and a brew.",

Lo and behold, my first attempt to submit a review by phone, and it went missing, including the draft.  Unlike the meal we had, which settled nicely into our stomachs, the review is floating somewhere in cyberspace.  A re-enactment follows.  It's been several years since we were at the Big Dog's on Rancho, long before my Yelp residency, and I didn't recognize it.  It was conveniently right across the street from the Lumber Liquidators that we'd just been to, so a welcome excuse to avoid cooking dinner was inviting us to cross the street.  Alas, we were about 10 minutes too late for Happy Hour, so we had to order off the regular menu.  Not such a bad thing, since we had a fabulous meal.  After quenching my thirst on my fave, Angry Orchard Cider on tap, I ordered the Southwest Turkey Melt, and Mr. G got the Pecan Crusted Walleye.  My sandwich was absolutely the best, full of stuff, including excellent turkey, and grilled just right.  Normally I wouldn't even have tasted the Walleye, since I try to avoid fried foods. (No, I didn't get fries with my sangwich).  But this one was pecan crusted; mention a nut and I go nuts, so I just had to sample it.  If I weren't so full from my sandwich, I would have inhaled every piece of walleye on that plate.  It was that good!  Service was exceptional: friendly, helpful and mostly prompt, amazing considering it was a weeknight and the place was jammed.    We are looking forward to going back.  That would have happened tonight, except that I had a BOGO birthday coupon that I wanted to use from a different pub before it expires.  But we'll be walkin' that Big Dog again before too long!",

    "text": "I have patronized Big Dog's Draft House on several occasions, and on this visit I thought it important to leave a comment.  I arrived at 7:00pm to meet a party that had been at Big Dog's Draft House since 4:30. Upon meeting our party, my husband and I were informed that the rest of the group had been waiting for their \"Green Beers\" for over 20 minutes. My husband went inside to order at the bar, while I sat at our table on the patio. While I waited, others in my party beckoned our server, Lisa, several times, each time being told \"you are my next table.\" During this time we watched Lisa serve the two tables nearest us repeatedly. Before Lisa finally arrived to take our orders, Sam, who appeared to be a busser, unwillingly took our orders. I ordered four drinks and a side of fries. One of the drinks and the fries I ordered arrived within 10 minutes (none of the other orders ever arrived). We continued to wait for the remainder of our order for the next 42 minutes. Finally, we decided that enough was enough and flagged down another server to get our check. After carefully looking over our tab, we noticed that we were charged for two items that did not belong to us. It took several additional minutes to reconcile the bill.   Ultimately, after sitting idle for more than an hour we requested to speak to a manager. Patty arrived at our table and heard our complaints. After a long wait, we were able to close our tab. Patty returned to our table with three gift cards for $15 each.   Big Dog's Draft House gets 1 star for their deliberately POOR service. And, 1 star for their attempt to appease us with gift cards.",

If you are a craft beer lover this is definitely a great spot to grab a few drinks.   We started off with the cheese curds due to many recommendations from others. I have to say, these were fantastic! I also tried the beer cheese soup, and it's probably the best cheese soup I've ever had. The the main course I got a rib-eye, with potato cakes and mac and cheese. First, the Rib-eye. The meat was fantastic, great quality, however, I wasn't a huge fan of the rub they put on it. It really hides the quality of the rib eye which I didn't think was necessary. The potato cakes were by far the best thing on the plate, very delicious. The mac and cheese tasted worse than boxed, it had zero flavor and hardly any cheese, definitely pass on that as a side option.  Beers:  I started off by trying their nitro Bourbon barrel stout. I'm not a huge fan of nitro beers, but this one was creamy, had a great whiskey barrel taste with lots of deep coffee notes. Overall, great beer. Next, while I totally despise any Miller, Bud, Coors type beers, I decided to try the Leg lifter Lager. This is by far hands down the best lager I've ever had. It's very crisp and refreshing. In fact, it was so good, I had 2 more. I finished off with their Amber Ale, which was very well balanced, good malt flavor. A very good amber that is brewed to style.  They even have 22 oz's to go in bottles which was a plus. I got 2 of those to go, War Dog IIPA and another Amber.   Overall, this is a fantastic place to visit if you love good food and great beer. I'll definitely be back.",

I had the \"Bucky Breakfast!\"  Bratwurst, eggs, homefries, toast... and a spicy bloody mary.  The sausage was very tasty - what a way to start off the day.  I ordered \"basted\" eggs.  Most of the time restaurants don't baste them right, but I always order basted anyway.  This place basted my eggs as good as my mom does!!!!!    I would give it 5 stars but too much Packer memoribilia!!!  JK.",

Their garlic fries are amazing! Been here a couple times with larger groups and they've always been really accommodating with splitting checks and multiple arrival times. They also have a discount for teachers!!",

However, the Reuben wasn't as good as it has been in the past. I think they are now using lunch meat type of corned beef.  They put apples in their sauerkraut now. It wasn't the best sandwich I've ever had there. The service by the bartender was excellent. I didn't get her name but she has Platinum and dark hair half and half. As busy as the bar was she served me very quickly got my beer within seconds and got my food order very quickly. Kudos to the service",

The Walleye is great and the brats do keep me happy. Did I mention the Cheese Curds??? BOMB!  2,  The beer here is great as well...one of the few local breweries we have  and one that didn't let their beer go straight to crap when the big hops shortage went down and the economy dipping. They also rotate some other brews from other micro breweries including other local ones which is a classy move.  I must add that I am a Packers fan so I do haunt this place on that note as well.",

    "text": "WITHOUT A HITCH!  My friends threw a birthday party for me on Saturday night.  They reserved two huge tables behind the bar area.  It was a great turn out....about 25-30 people showed.  My lasting impression is that \"they have done this before\".  Everything was so organized and flowed very well.  As you have seen in previous posts I love to entertain and have big get-togethers and this venue I will highly recommend.  Our waitress Tiffany was really the only one taking orders if I remember right.  Most all orders were individual and you know how that goes.  This chick was amazing.  She kept everything flowing, remembering where everyone was, who order what and kept handing me drinks throughout the night. haha  The bald guy (sorry bald guy-I didnt get your name) kept the tables clean of emplied plates and bottles which is a huge pet peive of mine.  I hugged him at the end of the night because without him the tables would have been a mess.  My boyfriend ordered a select number of appetizers for everyone....nachos, cheese curds, pizza bites and some kind of spinach dip.  All were fabulous bar food.  Someone ordered the pretzel and I am still dreaming about it.....and then someone else ordered the steak sliders.  Yes we will be back for those!  I must!!!  I must say Dear Draft House....I am impressed.  What a great night!  Thanks for making my birthday special (and to my friends of course)...and I will see you soon for another pretzel and steak sliders....and some beer! ;)",

I ordered the HolyCow Pale Ale. which was very good for such a darker beer than I'm used to (5.3% alc) My bf ordered a stout by accident and drank it anyway.. guy thing I think. Followed by a North Coast which he said was good but prob. wouldnt order again, gave him a headache.. The waitress was great though and came by and gave me a huge beer of Belgium white beer.. OMG that was the best beer I've ever had. served with an orange - so delish.. and free b/c she said it was poured on accident and she hated to pour it out. Shame I was so full from the most delicious Cobb Salad I've ever had and right now I've been in a cobb salad frenzy ordering it everwhere I go b/c its so chuck full of healthy fats and protein. It had the huggest chunks of blue cheese in the dressing - and salad and bacon, egg, avocado, tomatoes, grilled chicken, cheese, black olives.. My bf ordered a cheeseburger.. so freaking good he cut me a lil taste.. and the french fries were not shoe string and not steak fries but just in the middle, just right and seasoned to perfection, they were the \"didnt even need ketchup kind\" so good. The couple nxt to us had a philly and a wrap, neither of which appealed to either one of us so we were so happy with our decisions.. The salad was better than I picutred it..and I ordere the small and I was stuffed.. I cant imagine what the large looked like. Geez. I'd go bk here in a heartbeat even if I have to drive all the way from Henderson.  Note: Mondays is 2 for 1 philly cheesestake sandwhiches, not my thing but it might be yours. Tuesdays is 2 for 1 Cheeseburgers YUM!!!! Wed. is 2 for 1 AYCE fried shrimp. and i cant remember the rest to be honest but those stuck out to me.  Too bad I\"m trying to diet...hanging out with all this good food and beer CANNOT be conducive to my diet but all the same if you're looking for both good food and a chilled out atmosphere.. this place is for you. OH and MOST important.. we were there to watch a game and they had volume.. SO many places in town will show the game and then blare music instead... WTH? whats the point? This place has it all.",

Sat at the bar played poker while waiting for food order. Food order was slow in coming but was winning at video poker, so did not mind. Red hydrant ale was great with the red hydrant chilly and a quesadilla. The two of us walked out stuffed and very satisfied!!! The BIG DOG brew pub is a local gem !",

It easily compares to Stone, Pizzaport, and is better than Dogfish Head.  Two particular beers that they brew, Alpha Dog (a double red ale, 8% abv), and War Dog (IPA, 8% abv) are just incredible beers!  Try the bullocks IPA, or the Dirty Dog IPA if those are not available.    The food is standard bar food, but with a higher quality than most bars in Las Vegas.  The Cheese Kurds are so awesome, and all of the sandwiches are really good too.  The fries are great, and the service is always top notch.    I am a big fan of Draft House, and a big fan of their beer.  Check out Beer School, and their other events with live music and special guest brews like Pizzaport and Stone.",

As Packer fans filed in for their 1 o'clock game, we were being watched and lurked and talked about because we were in prime seats. I felt uncomfortable and told my husband we should just leave. As soon as we paid the check, and sat up, one of them came swooping in with his plate. We hadn't even moved away from the table yet!  Other than aggressive fans, it's one of our favorites to go. The food is good and the specials are nice. They're quick with service and friendly. They now also have shuffleboard and skee-ball.",

We ordered two Burger Specials server asked what toppings 3 and our side my mother ordered onion rings and I ordered fries , my mom asked about half and half and our server said she did not think they would do that then we ordered our drinks I had a coke and mom had a coffee... special is 10.00 for burger 3 toppings 1 side and drink it's called the Moo and Brew then we ordered a philly cheese steak with onion rings to go philly 12.00 when the bill came it was 44.00  10 + 10 + 12 = 32 plus tax right  nope  10.00 burger 10.00 burger 12.00 philly 2.50 onion rings  2.50 onion rings  0.75 too go order  Tax 1.89   Never once told onion rings extra never once told .75 to other to go buts that's not what made it a bad experience when my mom complained the server said okay fine I'll eat the cost of an onion ring we said we did not want her eating any thing and we thought the onion rings came with the burgers so she took the bill back to adjust it and that's when this young lady that all the make up in the world could not cover how ugly she was on the inside she said my server is not eating this part of the bill and we should pay it and it says right on the menu special comes with fries, coleslaw or cottage cheese that we should read it ....she was staring my mother in the face standing her ground like we said we did not want to pay the bill at all after about 10 min of this she snatched the to go philly off the table to have the onion rings removed and taken off the bill....and that's when I told my mom to forget the whole sandwich because she seemed like the type of person to do something to the sandwich... so we said for get the whole sandwich manager came to our table gave a half hearted apology said there system was new and gave us a 5.00 off coupon ... now I've done hospitality most of my life from bars to fine dinning never have I seen a server argue with a customer this was over 5.75 cents in onion rings .... I for one will not return not because of the food but because of that server and how the manger defended her but what might affect the brew house is my moms monthly group of 10 to 12 that goes there for the 10.00 burger special and have never once been charged for onion rings  and to top it off as we left the Savior of servers was at another table talking shit and laughing as we left ....I'll leave there names out of this but I would not hire that chick to serve my neighbors dogs ... what ever happened to the customer is always right even if there not .... youth today have no respect .. I miss the good old days ...",

We've been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, brought out of town guests, celebrated birthdays here, etc.   I love that this place has had the same owner for years, and that they've made this place a unique, local place for natives and visitors to visit alike. The food is always good, and there's not often problems with the food.   However, the service over the years has really, really gone down hill. Most recently, I went for a meal at 3:00 on a Tuesday. It was absolutely dead in the restaurant, with only one other table besides ours. Even still, it took half an hour for us to get our three entrees. It's really a shame because lately we've been passing on eating here because we don't want to wait through the awful service we've come to expect.",

So delicious! The only thing is that they don't can their stout (as I have been explained they don't do it for many reasons).  I guess I'll just have to drive all across town to have it.

    "text": "OPEN 24hours HAPPY HOUR 4-6PM everyday: 2$ off draft in house brews and some cocktails I have to agree: THIS PLACE LETS YOU SMOKE INSIDE and it is the first thing that you notice. It is sooooo overwhelming and I swear this was illegal to be smoking inside restaurants, but who know Vegas is all kinds of backwards. This place is and always will be a divey,casual sports bar. Large bar with casino style electronic card games, larger indoor and outdoor seating area which seats easily 200+ people (maybe 150).  Came here on a Friday afternoon around 5pm. Was seated immediately. First thing I noticed was how cheap the cocktails were esp the MULE style drinks 6-7$: vodka, bourbon, whiskey, tequila styles. DEF RECOMMEND Also the drafts include an IPA, Stout, Ale, etc. I had the Stout- it was a stout- nothing special- dark and chocolately. 1 glass- 4-6$.  For food: Cheese curds- 3/5 recommendation. They just seemed like breaded mozzarella sticks and if you don't eat them within 5min, they get super hard and close to inedible. The sauce that came with it was a ranch sauce and then there was this grotesques what I could only describe as: jalapeno, horseradish flavored stuff; At first it was like a creamy taste but then as you swallowed it, there was this sharp bitter flavor. Do not recommended this sauce.   Next time I come here will def sit outside when it gets a little warmer. THE SMOKE SMELL WAS A HUGE DETERRANT.",

Both a seated dining option and an expansive bar area are available for your personal enjoyment in this comfortable, cozy and large facility which looks a bit like a Midwestern barn on the outside.  A comfortable, casual ambience prevails here. No need to get all dressed up, come as you are anytime.  The owners of Big Dog's Draft House on Rancho Drive originally hail from Wisconsin (just like me) and have been in Southern Nevada for many years now.   They used to have a small brewery on the Las Vegas Strip called the Holy Cow Casino and Brewery many years ago. I still remember the coupons for free pint glasses of their pumpkin beer.  The likely German ancestry of the owners may explain the delectable, reasonably priced morsels that are always available here including bratwurst, an abundant variety of oversize sandwiches, diverse entrees, mouth-watering deserts, beers and much more.   The available food specials in the evening hours change by the day of the week, the season of the year and the owners' preferences or inspiration.   All you can eat seafood items such as shrimp, fish and the like are a recurrent then as are annual beer festivals such as the Summer Beer Fest and Peace, Love and Hoppy-ness which always draw a crowd due to their very reasonable pricing.  This location is also just a hop, skip and a jump from other fast-food options such as a Fatburger, Wendy's, Arby's and more. But if you are at the one and only Big Dog's Draft House, you'd truly be a fool to go anywhere else!",

They have a great ranch dip there and I think that makes/breaks bar food. The draft house salad is also a great choice for a \"healthier\" option. They give you a heaping amount of salad. Only downfall is if you sit in the bar area, you have the cigarette smoke to deal with while you eat and drink- but then again, that was the Vegas standard until recently",

If you are a DU supporter, you'll feel right at home.   The interesting twist is a microbrewery that is out of their main IPA!  Shocked!  WTH?  And this resulted in a rating reduction.  Settled for an initial pint of Red Hydrant to accompany a wonderful order of Wisconsin cheese curds.  Neither disappointed.   Maria ordered the Wisconsin Walleye and I selected the Mac and Cheese kicked up a notch with the Ghost Pepper Cheese. We ordered a family style Broccoli Salad for the table which was absolutely amazing. A smoky blend of broccoli, red cabbage, water chestnuts, cranberries, celery and sunflower seeds that was perfect!    Walleye excellent, Mac and cheese excellent",

I got the roast beef sandwich and it was so greasy I couldn't pick it up, the bun fell apart on the bottom. The Mac and cheese was not much above kraft. The pasta was way over cooked. I was going to give 2 stars until we sat and waited 20 minutes after we were done eating for someone to address we needed the check.

Almost like being home in Wisconsin in terms of the energy and game day atmosphere.  It had been a couple months since I'd gone here and I happened upon a slew of negative reviews.  I had to check it out to see if one of my favorite places in Las Vegas had really fallen apart.  I'm told the other locations had closed and this review does not reflect or comment on that.  That's a business matter for the owners to speak on and not the yelping public.  The menu is the same menu I remember.  I enjoy the cheese curds, Big Dog's salad, and Bratzel quite a bit.  The cheese curds are the closet thing to Wisconsin cheese curds I've had here in Las Vegas.  The Bratzel is a beautiful creation of cheeseburger, bacon and brat.  The big dog's salad is an excellent mexican style salad.  On my most recent visit I had the chicken friend steak.  The chicken fried steak was one of the better renditions of the dish I've had in town.  We dined in the dining room and our server (I want to say Lynn?) was excellent.  Long story short, I'm not quite sure where all the recent hatred for Big Dog's has come from.",

I stumbled upon the local/craft beer scene and the city of Las Vegas royally sucks for anything besides Budweiser products. I love every menu item I've tried. Cheese curds! The twice baked wings are delicious, and they even have veggie burgers :-) Great menu, overall.  Service here rocks. I never sat at the bar, but always at a table next to it. I've had a few different waitresses, all superb. My beer never was less than a quarter full before I was asked for refills, and no matter how long I sat there drinking the service was consistent. Five stars, if a smoker didn't always sit right next to me.",

And yes, I got my pot roast sandwich!   We had a group of 6 people and everyone loved their food.  My cousin had a huge burger with a bratwurst on it, on a pretzel bun.  She devoured it and said it was the best burger she'd ever had.  We also had the fried cheese curds which were gone in seconds LOL.    I couldn't finish my pot roast sandwich and wanted to take it home, but someone accidentally threw it out.  They gave me a whole new sandwich!    Big Dog's, you guys rock.  Keep up the awesome work!",

Also annual beerfests....how can you go wrong? The only thing that would make it better is droppin the packers vibe for a Raider Nation one but that's just wishful thinking. Love this place!",

Having said that, last time I was here the place was nasty smoky. Yes, nasty.  It was a Sunday and the football crowd was still here after the packers game, rooting, gaming, definitely smoking up a storm and drinking their bud. Don't even get me started on going to a brewery and ordering a bud bottle. That might just be the definition of insanity. Anyway, maybe it wasn't the best time for a nonsmoking, beer enthusiast to patronize this establishment. I take some of the blame, but I looked around this bar and I was not part of the majority demographic monopolizing the polluted air space.   I'm much better served coming here in the warmer months. Sitting outside, away from the smoke, maybe bring my dogs along, which are more than welcome. Or earlier in the day, through the week even. But the weekend, during American \"football\", watching people swill their bud, puff their stinking cigs, all while filling their faces with fatty bar food. No thanks.",

The other beers are damn tasty as well, but the IPA's are the stars!!  The food is good as well, that is not a hot dog on the bratzel burger genius, it's called a smoked Brat!! You can order it with a beer brat instead, and it is a thing of beauty!!  The cheese curds are just ridonculous, but pricey!!! One of my favs is the pretzels with a bowl of the cheese soup, dip the pretzels in the soup, Yummy!!!

    "text": "First off let me just say that I love beer and good bar food! With that said Big Dogs Draft house name says it all. Seems like a perfect fit for a guy like me, well I was wrong. I have now been into this place on 2 separate occasions and both times I received crummy service. Keep in mind I have yet to try a beer or any food here. First time I went it was so crowded there wasn't anywhere available to sit, so crowded that I couldn't even find a hostess or anyone to help seat us or make sense of the chaos that surrounded us. It was football season so I gave them a pass due to the craziness that is football season. After 5 minutes of looking for help we left.  Well I thought I would give them another shot today and let's just say this is the last time I will ever attempt to eat or drink there. I walked into the bar and showered the patrons inside with the sunlight from outside the bar. A few turned to see who was walking in. I sat down at the bar right in front of the main entrance and made eye contact with 2 of the bartenders. I sat for a couple minutes while 2 of the bartenders walked back in forth in front of me  and finished their orders. I continued to wait patiently for a few more minutes without any acknowledgement. The third bartender was counting her register and was standing 8 feet from me. No \"Hello\" \"welcome to big dogs\" \"can I grab you a beer?\" None of that. Not one word was spoken to me. All I got were side eye looks and no help.   Maybe this is the way it is here and I'm just a weird outsider who doesn't know the rules or maybe it's just a bar with really crummy customer service. I was really excited about trying some of their in house brews and finding a cool local bar with craft beers that I could call home. Oh well, I guess it's off to Lee's discount liquor next door instead.",

There were 2 other tables outside and the hostess told us we could sit out there. After sitting out there for 10min without seeing anyone I went inside to get menus and inform the hostess we still hadn't seen anyone. We waited another 10 min before leaving. I went to tell the hostess why we were leaving and she didn't say anything except, 'oh, have a nice night.' I wasn't happy with the lack of caring at all.

After our oldest daughter passed out from heat exhaustion, followed by many hours in the ER, we wanted to make sure we got lunch that she (well, all of us) would enjoy. We all loved this place, including youngest child (who is very particular). My husband did his homework, and we ended up here.   Cheese curds- ridiculous. I need these in my life more often.  Husband- Brewer's Sandwich. Bratwurst, another type of sausage, grilled onions, sauerkraut. (I told him he was going to have to get himself his own hotel room.)  Oldest daughter- cheeseburger, lots and lots of water, and a house brewed root beer.   Youngest daughter- kids' mac & cheese (Kraft from the box, but she loved it).  Me- the Cheesehead burger. Being a huge Packer fan, I had to get this.   And, speaking of the Packers, this restaurant/ brewery is full of Wisconsin paraphernalia, but more importantly, it's full of Packer stuff!  Now, the beers. Dirty Dog IPA, delish. Double Down (double) IPA- delish. Husband got the Double Down, but it's a 9% beer, so I only had a sip. We did get a flight also- cream ale, Imperial IPA, double IPA, stout, and a peach. The cream and peach were okay with, but the other three beers in the flight were wonderful.   Service was great and everyone was friendly.  My only complaint is... why can't this be 200 miles closer to my house?",

They have been out of items before which is understandable but never what you wanna hear.     Love their lil outdoor patio.  The bar area though has such a gaming atmosphere.  It is kind of a turn off for people who want to enjoy good beer in a chill atmosphere without feeling baked out in cig smoke.  But it is sports bar-ish so it works for them.  Good beer but I'd rather buy a growler and take it home than chill there for dinner and a few brews.",

    "text": "Big Dog's is your typical American restaurant with an above average beer selection. If you're looking for somewhere with a large variety to satisfy a group of people this is a good choice. They have a beer list that includes their own brews as well as guest taps and the standards. They had 3-4 sours on tap the day we went in. The restaurant is very dark, especially near the entrance. There's a huge bar in the center and a more formal dining room towards the back. They also have shuffleboard, Big Buck Hunter, jukebox, and plenty of TVs. I saw a group that had just finished a tour of the brewery so I guess they do that too.   I had the \"Ultimate Wisconsin\" grilled cheese. There was a ton of bacon in this, making it extraaa greasy. I was not a fan of the sundried tomatoes. They were really hard so if you bit into one you had to pull the whole thing out and eat it or set it aside. Fresh tomatoes would have been a better choice. My coworkers agreed their meals weren't anything special either (pot roast sandwich, philly cheese steak and patty melt). The food is nothing special. I may come here for a beer but that's about it.",

Beau treated us to a Brewery Tour after chatting about why we were there.  Seeing the ins and outs before sitting down to flights of their finest and about a half dozen appetizers was insightful and fun.  The food?  KILLER.  How can you screw up fried apps?  It's not like that.  These starters were crafted...yes, I said crafted, with care and it showed in presentation and taste.  The serving staff was so patient in helping our large party choose flights to their liking and everyone, even my non-beer drinking wife, had a fantastic time and truly remarkable food and drink.  We aren't waiting for the kids to come back as we've found our home away from home at Big Dog's!",

Big Dog's rotates a wide variety of home-brewed and guest taps and I can always find something great on the list. They also will give you a taster if you need. The food is based on Wisconsin favorites and includes options like bratwurst, cheese soup, macarconi and cheeses, and burgers. The menu has something for everyone though, as it also has salads, quinoa salads, ahi tuna, korean fajitas, and tons of other things that are atypical to find in bars. Ive been pretty happy with everything I have ordered, especially the bratwurst pretzel bread breakfast sandwich! Yum!",

We sat down to be ignored. No one came to our table. It was not busy at 2:15pm in the afternoon. After several minutes sitting there, I wanted to interrupt my friends story to ask her if she wanted to go somewhere else. Finally she realized and says, \"Is anyone going to come to our table?\" Luckily, she wanted to leave so we went down the street to Applebees. Way better service at Applebees. Good food and drinks is what we wanted. You really lost us as customers and my friends as well. I won't go back. Being ignored is probably the worst thing you can do to a customer.",

Guy sitting in the bar had his dog leashed, but was allowing the pup (approx 3-4mo old Husky) to run all around the bar causing several people to trip over the leash or run into the dog. I was one of those people. The guys response after I tripped was simple; He barked at me with an attitude and said \"WATCH OUT!\" When asking around, it turns out that guy was KURT, the owner.  Very classy. The owner allowing his non-service animal to run around in an unsupervised manner in a loud and heavy traffic led bar environment with no care for customer and employee safety. Apparently it was MY fault that his dog was running around the bar. Last I checked, a non-service animal in a restaurant was not in compliance with the Health Department, who I've already contacted and filed a complaint with. As well as both City & County Business Licensing and LVMPD SIS (Liquor Licensing).   While you may have a good lawyer, ultimately it's your responsibility to keep employees, customers and other guests safe inside of your venue/property. Hopefully your negligence to do so, bad attitude, and shitty disposition disrupts your business and costs you future money. Have some accountability and change your attitude Kurt. Smh",

I had ordered Hefeweizen beer, red bean soup and sliders that seemed like a good idea at the time. Everything was great until my mini burgers turned into a cheese nightmare...seriously.   When the sliders came out they were cold, overdone and the cheese wasn't melted, which made for crappy tasting sliders. I politely asked my waitress if she could just warm them up a bit so the cheese could melt and she didn't seem too thrilled about it.  The second time around the sliders came out with melted cheese.... but this time they had tripled the amount of cheese which I didn't ask for and it was just gross. At this point I could continue with what will end up a rant review so I'll just get to the point.  In a medium size nutshell my bill came to $29 tip not included in calculation for cold food, slow and poor service from waitress and management. So this experience for me means it will have to take a miracle for me to come back.",

They have a lot of Wisconsin plates, which were super good! You must try the cheese curds and the Wisconsin brats!  Did I mentioned they brew their own beer?? I really like supporting our local brewers, so please come and drink a beer! Their service was really good, even though the bar was very busy our waitress was checking on us on a regular basis! I'm giving them 3 stars mainly due to their nachos and poor tv image. I mean, come on! A great sport bar must have great nachos!!! Their ingredients were very cheap and not very tasty, they need to add more ingredients and maybe some chicken. Also, knowing that this is a green bay packers bar their tvs should have a better image, they do not seem to have HDTV and they had tons of problems with the sound!",

The Brewmaster Dave Otto is, in my opinion the Best brewer in the state, him along with his crew have amassed 11 awards, since 1993, they have even beat out some of the big boys in a few categories. My personal favorite is the Watch Dog Wit, a Belgian style white ale that is a perfect summer cooler. A Hop Head as well he makes some very bold but balanced Hop bombs. A rotation of seasonal beers keeps the menu fresh and your tastes buds coming back for more.  They also host a Beer School several times a year where participants are indoctrinated in the process that goes into making their favorite beverage.  You help make the beer and get to take some home when it is ready.

    "text": "Heard from @Dan P that they just tapped a batch of War Dog last Thursday....so I made sure I stopped by for lunch as soon as I came back to Vegas on Sunday.  Brought Mom's with me for our traditional Sunday lunch....we were staving and couldn't wait to get seated.  The Draft House is a Green Bay Packers Bar.....so it was packed with Packer Fans on the bar side....not one available seat or table.  It was 3 pm and the Packers vs Vikings game wasn't for another 2 hrs, but it was packed to the hilt!  We got seated in the dining room area, our server wes named Apple, seriously.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, we asked Apple if there were any specials....she proceeded to tell us about a bunch of Appetizer Specials ($2 off) and $2 off for the War Dog during the NFL Games, so we took her up on it.  We ordered:  - 1/2 Order of Nachos $7.50 - Bratwurst $3.50 - Jalapeno Stuffed Pretzels $5 - NFL Hot Wings (10 Wings) w/Chipotle Sauce....their hottest Wing Sauce $6  To wash it down, we both ordered Water and I of course ordered a 24 oz War Dog!  ($7.50, $5.50 with the special) The War Dog was freakin' awesome.....not as Hoppy as I expected based on @Dan P's report, but it was very good.  After a short wait, we got our food....Nachos first.  Mom and I attacked those Nachos.  They were pretty good....topped with Sour Cream, Cheese, Guacamole, Olives, Jalapenos, Salsa, and Onions.  Next up was the NFL Wings.....I jumped on those next....damn, they were awesome!  Very Meaty Wings.....the Chipotle Sauce was just right....had that Smoky flavor and was just Spicy enough for me and Mom.  The Ranch given to us for dipping went well with the Wings.  They brought out my Bratwurst next.....I added some Mustard and Relish and went to town on it.  It came with grilled Onions topped on the Bratwurst.  It was pretty good....although the Bun wasn't all that.  I would have preferred a Roll or Italian Bread instead of a Hot Dog Bun.  The last item to come out was the Jalapeno Stuffed Pretzels.....they were piping hot and moist and doughy.....delish!  They came with a side of Nacho Cheese for dipping.  It was at this point that Mom and I figured out that we ordered too much food.  I wasn't going to let this place defeat me though, so I pressed on.  Mom said she'd finish the Nachos and I would handle whatever was left of the Wings & Pretzels.  We took our time watching the Seahawks vs Cardinals game and finished our food and Beer.  When Apple delivered our check she said she made a mistake and gave us the food specials for Monday Night Football, not Sunday....but that the restaurant was going to honor the specials anyway because of the mistake....is that great service or what?  Overall, great food & great service.  Will I return?  You bet!",

I don't know why they would have a dog friendly patio with space heaters and TV's if the hostess is just going to tell you they have no one to serve you out there. Probably for the best anyways as the food quality has gone down hill and the beer prices have gotten ridiculously high in the last few years. Too bad because their beer is actually pretty good. I recommend just stopping in and getting a growler fill.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I've got to downgrade Big Dogs from 4 stars to 2.  Simply put the service and quality have slipped.  Seems they have become complacent in their success over the years.  Hopefully, they will figure out it's time to step up their game before it's too late.  I am definitely paring back my visits and exploring new possibilities for my dining dollars.    Recently ordered the Raspberry Chicken Salad (I've had it at least 20+ times) and was disappointed.  Salad came out wilted and not fresh.  Seemed like it had been prepared in advance, wrapped in plastic with the dressing already applied and put in the cooler.  At least that's the impression I got.  Fewer chicken and pecans than normal.    A lot of little things add up.  Seems the servers don't do anything extra nowadays.  Sometimes I like to split a salad.  In the past they would separate it onto two plates.  Now, they will bring you an extra plate IF you ask and you can split it yourself.  I recently ordered dessert and the waitress arrived with the cheesecake and queried, \"I see you still have your fork, would you like a new one or do you want to use the one on your plate?\".  Yeah, I want to eat my cheesecake with the same fork with which I just finished my spaghetti.  Are you kidding me???  That's like me asking you, \"Do you want a tip or did you get enough from the last customer?\"  The reason I still have the fork and the dinner dishes is because you didn't clear the table yet.  There's a beer cooler near the restaurant entrance that has been broken for at least 3 months.  It has a sign on it apologizing for the inconvenience during the temporary outage.  Hell, if you aren't going to fix it - remove it and put in an extra table.  I'm sure it could be repaired in a couple days.  Loosen up the purse strings man.  Sorry to have to give up on this place, since I was a regular.  Will stop back occasionally to see if they get their S**T together, and let you know.",

We started out with the Wisconsin cheese curds..they were yummy and the creamy horseradish sauce to dip them in was wonderful. I got the butterflied grilled bratwurst on a pretzel roll and have to say it was the best bratwurst  sandwiche I ever had. It came with carmelized onions, peppers and sauerkraut.  The garlic fries were just okay, as the garlic was rather weak. I tasted the chili and thought it was too thick and pasty.  They have a nice selection of craft beers. The IPA was not overly hoppy and refreshing.  The pumpkin ale was light (would like more pumpkin) and I thought had too much cinnamon. The milk stout was smooth and creamy.    The service was quick and friendly. The restaurant is clean,  with plenty of seating both inside and out. I love the big dog outside and the decor over all is very pleasant. (See my pics)  I look forward to visiting again the next time I'm in town.",

After being seated, took her 15 minutes to greet us. Placed our order, another 10 minutes until she brought our soup out. She didn't proactively bring out the condiment cart for our brat, we had to ask, nor did she bring out plates for the pizza. We had to ask for those too after she delivered the pizza. The highlight of the terrible service was that she never filled up our soft drinks ONCE. We had to walk to the bar ourselves TWICE, to get them refilled ourselves. After she delivered our food, she never came back to see how everything came out nor to clear our soup cups. We had to clear our own table and place them on the empty table next to ours. Being loyal customers for years, we may have to rethink Draft House if you find Tiffiny's waitressing skills acceptable. Come on guys! You can do so much better and deliver a wonderful customer service experience!",

Ordered the cheese curds for appetizer. They were okay, it seemed they might have sat quite a while in the kitchen before being delivered to our table.  We  never got dinner  After waiting long over an hour for dinner, we asked for our check, paid and left.. The waitress apologized, stating they were experiencing troubles over the new menu.   UPDATE:  The manager contacted me with an apology for our experience and invited us to return to Big Dog's for another try.  Everyone deserves a second chance.

We had already eaten, but looked at the menu for kicks.  The menu had great beer food like bratwursts, bavarian pretzels, etc. in addition to things like pulled pork tacos and pizzas.  Great variety!  There is a 24 hour breakfast menu as well.  Big Dog's brews its own beers, and I was able to try the Belgian Strong Ale (9.0% abv) and the Barleywine (11.5% abv).  Both of them were excellent...especially the Barleywine!  They have a huge range of beers starting off at low abv's and moving up through your 11.5% styles.  There was something for everyone and there are daily food and drink specials!  I know that on Tuesdays beers are $2 off for 24 hours and burgers are 2 for 1.  Our bartender was fantastic and we will definitely be back to see him.    Most of the time the smoking in restaurants/bars in Vegas really bothers me, but the ventilation in this place is so awesome, that I didn't even notice when the people around me were smoking.  I highly recommend this place!",

The food is consistent, and the wait staff is usually attentive and upbeat without fawning or getting too personal.  We went again yesterday, and the menus were all new.  It seems that the food is the same but some of the prices seem higher.  We probably won't be able to visit as often as a result.  Yesterday my husband had the Tex-Mex burger, which he said was great, and one of my sons had the sliders with onion rings.  I had the pulled pork sliders and sweet potato fries.    As usual the food came fast, we never had to wait for anything like water.  There was plenty of food and we needed a take-home box.  The stout beer and root beer, both brewed on site, was really nice.    All of the food was terrific except the sweet potato fries. Last time we had sweet potato fries at the Big Dogs on Sahara, they tasted like sweet potatoes.  This time, at the Draft House, they tasted like nothing except the powdered sugar they sprinkle on top.  They were completely flavorless.  The mustard dip was great, but I was hoping to be able to taste sweet potatoes.  That's the only thing that prevented this from being a five star rating.  I'm sure we'll be back, because we like the place, but I don't think we'll order the sweet potato fries again unless  they make a change there.",

As close to home as you get out west.  The beers are equally impressive.  I fancy myself a beer snob, and I love some of the special brews they have at Big Dog's.    As much as I love the food here, I have to limit myself to only quarterly visits at best.  The dishes here are lumberjack portions!  I usually go into a short coma after a visit, but it's definitely worth it.  If you're a Packers or Badgers fan, and haven't been here yet, shame on you!

Overall, I like this place and I'm willing to give it a second chance even though I didn't have a slam dunk first impression. I'm optimistic  that I'll be able to eventually find a staple dish that I'll love, but bottom line is that I'd come back for the beer.  What to avoid: The Wisconsin Walleye- I ordered this dish to be healthy. So I got the steamed version. It was supposed to come with a lemon glaze? Which was non-existent. The fish was completely bland with no flavor, and my first bite of the fish was full of bones. So that was a huge disappointment But this place can definitely offer a good time- chilling with your friends, drinking some beers, and munching on the Bavarian pretzels! The pretzels are awesome- super soft and salty served with a honey beer mustard dipping sauce. Can't go wrong there.",

It is offered in 3 ways: traditional corn meal breaded pan fried, broiled with citrus glaze or our house specialty \"pecan crusted.\" includes your choice of two sides for $20. The fish was delicious BUT, stay away from the breading, it over powers the delicacy of the fish. Unfortunately, I had to send it back because I ordered it with the \"pecan crusted\" coating.  Order it BROILED! The Broccolini side dish was tasted wonderful and cooked al dente to perfection. I am coming back for that same dish broiled.",

We sat in the main dining room, and the Wisconsin nostalgia gives the place a lot of atmosphere. We ordered the nachos for an appetizer, and it was good but lacked cheese. My wife had the chicken and artichoke mac and cheese, which she loved. I had the pepperoni pizza with olives and onions and mushrooms, which was loaded with the cheese that was missing from the nachos. The light beer is very similar to Bud Light. My wife wanted to buy one of their way overpriced hoodies for 50 bucks! But they were all out of her size, which, for the price, was a huge relief. Our server, Trevor, was very attentive when we first got there. I give it an A for the food, an A for the service, an A for the price, and definitely an A for the atmosphere.",

    "text": "Don't judge a book by its cover! My sister picked this place to meet for lunch. I checked the menu online and immediately was skeptical. Korean style fajitas? Really? Walked in and it was exactly like the old Vegas bars of my youth. Smokey, dark and at 11:00 am, the people at the bar looked like they had been there since last night. I made my way to the dining room which had high ceilings and no smoking. There were a few options for breakfast and I ordered chicken fried steak. My sister ordered a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries.  My plate was really good. Hashbrowns were different (see my picture) but I really enjoyed them. Eggs were cooked perfect and the gravy was delicious and hot. The English muffin needed another round in the toaster, but that's an issue happening everywhere (stupid muffins). When I had basically cleared my plate, I started in on my sister's sweet potato fries and they were damn tasty. She had the nerve to say to me \"You were hungry!\" like she doesn't even know me!  I wish I could remember the server's name. She rocked. Kept my coffee full, was patient when we weren't ready to order for a while (and not because we were on our phones). Super-efficient and edgy enough to keep the male clientele at bay. Just a reminder for those of you who aren't aware, the standard tip for good service is 20%  I guess it's like a biker's diner except there was a kale garnish on my plate. And Korean style fajitas? Really?",

Once I got home I found out the Chicago style fries I ordered to go were hard and stale.",

    "text": "Big Dog's Draft House has been on my list of places to try for a few weeks now. So, since my boyfriend and I were in the area, we decided to try it for lunch around 3PM. We got lost on the way there. For some reason, the address on GPS took us to the residential area behind the Draft House. Anyway, not really a big problem, just had to drive around the block.   So, we were greeted and sat in the dining hall. It had a super \"homey\" feel to it with all the barn house decor. I loved it. It looked like there was one waitress that was managing the few tables that were in there during that time. She was very nice and helpful in deciding what we wanted to order. She also checked on us appropriately and gave us information about their rewards program. The food took a little longer than expected to arrive, but that wasn't a problem since we were killing time, anyway.   I ordered a beer flight, Wisconsin beer cheese soup, and lobster mac-n-cheese. All were phenomenal. Let's talk about the beer cheese soup. It was literally one of the best soups I've ever tasted. SO good. My boyfriend and I were fighting over the last spoon-full. I would come back for this soup alone. We are still talking about it a day later.  Mac-n-cheese is actually a lot more difficult to perfect than one would think. It's not just noodles and cheese. This place did it right. I opted to add the smoked ghost pepper jack cheese to my dish. It was the right move. I love anything spicy, so it added the perfect flavor to the pasta. There were only a select few pieces of lobster that I could find in my dish, but that didn't detract from the meal.   The beer flight was really good. I had a hard time choosing my favorite beer. Usually, in a flight, there is at least one beer that you know you don't like. I liked them all in this flight. The flights also came in this really cool swirl holder. Definite points for presentation.   Overall, I was extremely satisfied with the entire meal. I will be back, for sure. My only complaint is that it's a bit far from my house! Thanks for great service and amazing food!",

    "text": "My first time here at this restaurant and it was fantastic!! We were a group of five people that hardly come to this side of town. We chose the dining room section because the bar reeks of smoke. We were seated in less than five minutes. The dining room has plenty of space for big groups to sit in and three televisions all around. Great craft beer selection, you can bring your own growler to take some home with you too.  First off, the WISCONSIN CHEESE CURDS. OMG they were excellent! I have never tried cheese curds before and decided to give it a shot. I am very happy that I did. They look like little tater tots but stuffed with cheese. Next, we shared a basket of chicken wings, except for me, because I'm vegetarian. I only ate the vegetables that came with the wings. And finally, I got myself a big, fat, large pizza. Of course, I took it home with me because I couldn't finish it. My groups food included burgers and ribs. Will definitely be back, whenever I'm on this side of town again.",

I tried the special of the day which was a prime rib torta. It had pepper strips, prime rib, avocado, mushrooms, and prime rib. It had a lot of flavor and was a great special. I ordered the garlic fries which I was expecting the generic fries with garlic spice but they actually used a garlic herb paste, for lack of a better word, to coat and cover the fries. It was super flavorful but could over powering to a non garlic lover. I am excited to go back and try out more dishes and brews.",

The event was very busy and they had a tent outside where 4 of the beers were available. Lots of Nevada breweries donated to the event, which was incredible! I was happy to support the cause and the amazing variety of brews (25 total) was not to be missed!   Big Dogs is a nice enough place, and a huge place, with a lot of hustle on the part of the employees. The bar is very big and probably always pretty smoky, as it is a gaming bar. Fun tidbit- Big Dogs has 35 machines, which according to their Web site are \"grandfathered in\". I assume that having 35 machines is no longer permitted in taverns. The decor is welcoming and eclectic. The skee ball machine near the patio entrance caught my eye, and I would definitely try it out if I return.   I placed a to go order at the bar and wasn't given a wait time. Instead of waiting at the bar, I went outside to wait near the patio. A server tracked me down with my order quicker than I anticipated it would be ready, considering the crowd inside. I had the green muenster grilled cheese with bacon, green chiles and avocado. Way too many chiles! It was basically a chile sandwich with not enough cheese. It tasted fine, but I was disappointed that their grilled cheese sandwich was lacking cheese. And the bread was a little burned. Doh!",

Good selection of beer and decent food. Staff was friendly and prompt.

    "text": "I think the world has been brainwashed into a low bar of service, hence the many good reviews. This place is, at minimum, an argument for abolishing tipping. I agree with the reviewers regarding the service. We were handed menus, and before we could open them, we were asked what we wanted, as if the information had been magically downloaded into our heads.   Our waitress was equally robotic. She didn't try to sell us anything, talk about the craft beers, or pretend that we were helping to pay her check in any way,  So we ordered. The food was tasty enough, albeit overpriced. The beer, not as good Aces and Ales offers a better drink experience. My stout lacked the dimension and heartiness I expect, and its flavor was dull.  My friend ordered pastrami on sourdough. It came out on rye. The took it back to the kitchen and simply scraped it on to new toasted bread, losing half the sauerkraut in the process.  We boxed our own leftovers. Our waitress did come to us at the end, smiling, hoping everything was all right. It was--just all right. Definitely not worth the price tag.  At least it was a good night out with friends. We'll go elsewhere next time",

The only thing I  DO NOT like is that they do NOT reserve the machines for players and they will not move anyone that is not playing.  So, if you come in when it's busy (or not) and you want to gamble you're more than likely to not find a machine available.  And no one is going to move the non playing A HOLE  that's sitting in front of a machine playing on his phone!  So we leave and go elsewhere!  Which sucks for us (and them actually) because we'd rather hang out there.  But if they'd rather have non gamblers NOT putting money in their machines but sitting in front of them, then great!  I'll go elsewhere and spend my $$$. And that's what we do now!",

To really not be seen again, she rather chat it up with her what seemed to be regular customer, then serve us. Basically,Never did she come back to see if I needed another beer or if my friend needed a refill on her soda. For the price you pay, I deserve better service. I almost always tip well, but today not so much. I had to actually get out of my seat to find her just to pay!!   Food/drink: I ordered the dirty dog IPA. I have to say it was pretty good!! Now the philly cheese sandwich, not so worth the $11 I paid. Whoa! A bit over priced for something not that great tasting. The beer cheese soup was excellent tho. Very good!!   Overall I do think prices are a bit high for quality of food and service. I'm actually giving 3 stars for beer and soup only. If that sucked I would have given none!!",

I've been going to Big Dog's Draft House for years. Just consistently good food, beers were always great and the service was fine. The past few times though, the food seemed old, overcooked, not fresh or just plain bad. I don't know if they've changed hands recently or they are cutting back. This past Sunday (7/17/16) I took my visiting brother (from Boston) to show off some of the great places we have here in Las Vegas. He was underwhelmed, to say the least. Not wanting to over-eat because of a big dinner, we both had the Big Dog salad or Signature salad? Not sure what it's called. Anyway, this dome-shaped pile of completely wilted lettuce and slime came out. I was pretty embarrassed, as I should have been. I didn't want to make an issue out of it, but neither of us finished and we left.  Someone else in our party got a plate of your wings which seemed like they were cooked and recooked so many times they meat was dried and pulled away from the bone. The cheese curds were great, thanks for not screwing that up. Come on guys, get it together. You used to be great and consistent, don't let your customers down!",

    "text": "As a fan of quality craft beer, I was excited to try Big Dog's. I'd had it bookmarked for months. Unfortunately, I came on the wrong day; they were out of the first FOUR beers I ordered -- the pale ale, Red Hydrant, Dirty Dog IPA, and 38 Special. Finally, I had the waitress tell me what she DID have, so she went off to the bar, and came back with a recommendation of a rye ale, which I ordered. It was probably the best fifth choice I've ever had. Apparently, Big Dog's had taken part in some sort of craft beer festival the day prior, and ran out of all of their beers there.  For food, I had the sliders, which were okay; nothing special about them, and no reason to order them again.  Our waitress (sorry, can't remember her name) seemed to want to do a good job, but also had a bit of a deer-in-the-headlights look about her. I envisioned that she had recently been in some sort of white-collar industry, and had not been waiting tables for very long.  I would probably give Big Dog's another try, but I'm not really in any hurry to do so.",

    "text": "Yay! I'm a fan of Big Dog's...only if I'm in the area.  At Big Dog's, the portions are just that, pretty big.  Service is always quick to be seated, order to be taken, and food to arrive. Can't give them 5 stars for service because at Big Dog's, they are not the most attentive group.  Once you get your meal, there are times you don't see or hear from a server until your check is given to you.  My suggestion is to do what I always do, order your drink refill early.   As for the food, it's not bad and the portions are good.  -Sliders: This was recommended on my very first visit about two years ago.  Priced about average (less than $10)' It's still delicious and taste about the same as other pub and grill joints.  -Fish and Chips:  Deep fried and greasy.  Poke a couple of holes in the breaded fish and drain the greasy out first.  Now you're takin'.  Now it's at least edible.  I think the batter is a little too thick and takes away from the taste of the fish.  -Steak:  Not a bad option, but it's a little dry.  However, it's cheap and you get what you pay for.  -Pizza:  Has to be over 2 years since my last pizza here, but it's cheap and one of their better prepared items here.  For less than $10, a personal pizza here is tasty and not too greasy.  -Burgers:  2nd favorite to their pizza.  Their burgers are stacked, juicy, and affordable.   I never expect much at Big Dog's because the prices are cheap and it's basically pub food.  Portions are big and there's still enough on the menu for everybody.",

I'd never heard of such a thing, and so it seemed interesting.  Let's start with, \"They are not afraid of a fat gram.\"  This place served fried cheese curds.  Ponder that for a moment, and know that our group loved them, along with our other two appetizers, onion rings and buffalo chicken wings.  A great start to a meal.  We were there on a Friday, and so they had a fish special going on that one in our group enjoyed, it was a member of the 'all you can eat' variety, and he only had one plate.  He was full.  I enjoyed the fish taco's made with walleye.  Very appealing presentation and the sauce was good.  Did I mention the beer?  They had a variety, and all in our group were happy.  They've got beer and they've got good food, what else does a sport fan need on the first night of playoff baseball?  That would be TV's, and they've got a bar full of them, and they've even overflowed into the room where they are serving dinner.  Would my wife approve of this, absolutely not, but she's not with me, and so all is good.  Again, if I lived remotely near this place, I'd be back, but probably not with my wife.",

We landed in this place, and I was not disappointed.  I had the Draft House burger with garlic fries. It was to die for. The burger was juicy, drippy, and perfect. Slathered with two huge pieces of applewood smoked bacon, carmelized onions, and sauteed mushrooms, it was a huge success. The best part was the melty, gooey cheddar cheese. I can't say enough about how amazing this burger was.  My husband had the green ghost burger. It came with avocado and ghost pepper jack cheese. It had a substantial kick, and definitely hit the spot. We decided that combining the two; a Draft House burger with jalapenos added would be the ultimate success.   Garlic fries were garlic-y and delicious, perfectly crispy.  I'm not currently drinking, due to health reasons, but I tried their home-brewed root beer and it was divine. I almost took a growler home of it.   I'd absolutely recommend the restaurant side of this place. The bar side is way too smoky to be enjoyable. Service was a little slow, considering they weren't overly packed.  We'll be back, for sure.",

Forget everything you thought you knew about burgers because this thing is reinventing the wheel.  1/3 lb burger patty, smoked bratwurst, applewood smoked bacon, cheddar & swiss cheeses, fried onions, lettuce, tomato and topped with, the holy grail of all buns, the pretzel bun.  The burger comes paired with a pickle slice and fries. Our waitress came by to offer me a box and to her horror discovered nothing but crumbs.  She fumbled over her words quivering at the lips....how...how did...did you eat the entire. I took it upon myself to quickly cut her off and reply with,\" yeah bitch, I'm an Fing bad ass\". OK maybe that didn't happen but I did clean my plate and had wet dreams about it for nights to come. Wash it all down with one of their award winning micro brews and you'll find yourself on cloud nine.  I love this place and you should to.  Great atmosphere, punctual and friendly wait staff, good down home cooking, and one hell of a happy hour.  Go to Big Dogs, catch a game and pound some beers.  You won't be disappointed.",

Pretty typical of a sports bar type place - jerseys, license plates, other odds and ends decorating the walls. It was freezing cold in there. Usually we welcome nice cool AC int he middle of Las Vegas summer, but this place was like a fridge. All of us in our party were freezing. We had to move to a different table that was not under ceiling fans.  The food was just average. We had nachos for appetizer. The portion was good, but nothing special about it. Looked like just a pile of chips with some cheese sprinkled on it and microwaved. Some of the cheese wasn't melted. Whole dish was just luke warm. For entrees we had club sandwich, fish and chips, and a southwest melted sandwich. All of it was average bar food. Nothing outstanding or signature about any of the dishes. Service was decent. All of us had that I ate too much greasy food feeling when we left. We probably will not go back there. Food was not worth the price. So many other options out there for better food and better prices.",

I don't know about their other beers though, as I've only ever had their in-house made ones.  Their IPA is about the best I've ever had, and while I'm a Guinness boy to my core, their stout almost makes me stray.  Their Red Hydrant Ale is also very good, I'd say on par with any good ale out there.  Now, if they could make a Cider I'd be very happy. Food:  The food is okay, but it's not the best.  Their Cheese Curds are, I'd say, their best option.  You'd think for a Wisconsin bar that things like Nachos would be just dripping with cheese, but you'd be wrong.  Their garlic fried are just regular fried with an epic-crap-ton of raw chopped garlic on top, not so good.   All in all, I'd come back (and I do!), and I'd definitely tell anyone looking for a good small-brand locally brewed beer to check this place out.",

This was my first to the Draft House but I know it won't be the last.  -Food selection was great, and was very surprised by the quality and great selection of non fried foods. It was 3am and usually fried diner food is all one can find so this was a HUGE plus.   -Got the breakfast sandwich with sausage, one friend got the same with the bacon, and the other got some kind of big salad.   Everything was great and they had to-go boxes on hand to take home our drunken left overs. We are already planning on going back, and if not to this location to the other one.  Oh also our bartender was so cool and quick to get us everything we needed. Thanks for saving out night.",

I don't like oversized wings, and they cook theirs just right. Not slimy, and the perfect amount of crunch on the outside. I will say the seasoning can be a bit on the salty side. The service we have experienced has been good, never has been bad. So why three stars??? Well, it's bar food, good bar food....and pricey bar food. The twice baked wings are 11.99 and its maybe 8 wings. Then you have to pay extra for fries and a drink. The garlic fries are also really good. So your looking at close to 16.00 bucks for some wings. I love going but not too often just because of the prices.",

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich (garbage), the pork was tough and really seemed like yesterday's left overs (after it sat out and got dry), overloaded with a overwhelming bbq sauce that still couldn't mask the flavor of the nasty pork! The fries were good, and me trying to be positive, just figured some cooks have different standards (I wouldn't dare say Chef!).  So that said,  I hadn't seen my mother in a long time, and she seemed to be enjoying her food, so I didn't mention how much I disliked my food (although it was evident after I didn't take more than a couple bites after I had just talked up how much I would like a pulled pork sandwich). The last straw for me was when as we were walking out, our waitress mentions, loudly, to the hostess \"wow they took forever\". I figure she hadn't seen her tip yet, and I probably should have went back and taken it back! but I did nothing as she gave us another sarcastic comment before we left. I will say again, my mother is a regular here so I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable.  I kept my mouth closed, even though I feel we did nothing wrong for sitting there for a couple hours catching up on missed moments.  we bought food, drinks, and tip well..  I thought that's what restaurants were for??  Please correct me if I'm wrong!",

The menu is fairly basic meat and potatoes combinations, though there are interesting twists. The beer selection seemed slightly narrow, but the red ale (Hydrant, I believe) was actually exceptionally tasty.  I got the brat platter with sweet potato fries and garlic mashed potatoes. The brats were okay. One of them tasted like a basic hot dog, which sucked. The sweet potato fries were very good, but I really could have done without the powdered sugar. The garlic mashers were also quite good. The portions were fairly large and I wasn't able to finish everything.  Overall, this seemed like a really cool place and the beer was quite respectable.

We parked the car and had a wonderful waitress and wonderful dinner, recommendation, don't let Lee ruin your night, talk with someone else, Lee consider taking a course in customer service or think about an office job, you would meet your love for doing paperwork and not have to be distracted by customers.",

Ordered the cheese curds, which are highly recommended.  Comfort food on steroids.  Ordered a cheeseburger, which was prepared perfectly, and it was so big I'll have 1/2 a burger for lunch tomorrow.  My first experience was just a bad night for them.  Everything ran smoothly tonight and their patrons seemed happy.  I will definitely return and a big high five and thank you to Big Dog's",

    "text": "We were visiting Las Vegas from Orlando, FL and wanted an experience off the strip as well as to try some local craft beer. This place is about 15 miles north of the strip and really not difficult to locate. Our party of 5 was greeted and seated at a spacious booth. Our server, Debra, explained the beers in detail, and we ordered several, with Peace, Love and Hoppiness being our favorite. Our traveling companions were not as well versed in craft beer, but Debra managed to get them beverages they enjoyed. We shared a pizza and several entree salads, and the food was awesome! But it was the beer we came for, and we thoroughly enjoyed every sip. We were even told we could purchase a 6-pack of Peace, Love & Hoppiness to take with us at $1.00 off! So we did, and in it went in the suitcase traveling back home. I would return to Big Dog on my next trip back to Sin City. And Thank You, Debra, you were wonderful!",

    "text": "This review is going to honestly pain me. My family, friends, and I have been coming to Big Dogs for years. They have great food and beer but it does not make up for the exceptionally rude and unattentive staff. My last experience was the last straw for me and I actually wrote a letter to their corporate office. I have not heard one peep back from them and that let's me know they do not care about their long time customers and I have decided to not step foot in here again.  This use to be my go to spot to grab a drink on Friday night and then grab some take out during the week. I've sat here numerous times waiting for my take out order and seen party after party walk out because of the hostesses. They are rude and will not acknowledge people standing right in front of them. It's the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. When they finally look up they act as if they are doing you a favor.  Its the same at night with the bartenders. It can be empty and no one comes over to you even when they clearly see you. I've waited for well over 10min before someone decides to come over. That has become normal, it's like the only work when they feel like it.  The reason I won't come in here was due to how I was treated the last time I came in to pick up my to go order. I'm a very friendly, patient person, who also tips very well due to the fact I worked in service industry years ago. When you place a to go order over the phone they send you a text when the order is complete and it makes it easy so you don't have to wait around. Placed my order which was easy enough was told it wouod be ready soon. I received my text that it was ready and headed down. Got up to the hostess stand and like always she ignores you until you get her attention to look up at you. I pay for my order and she tells me she will go get it ready. Well 45min later I'm still waiting without even being told anything. I finally get up and ask her where my food is. I get an immediate rude response and she literally points to the bar area and says they are busy and everyone needs their food made. I inform her that I placed my order in over an hr ago and I received my text that it was ready so it doesn't matter that the bar is busy. She ignored me and just walked off.   At this point I'm really annoyed and find a waiter who was actually nice and asked him if he could please check on my order. He does and comes back and tells me he's sorry but it hasn't even been made yet. I wanted a refund at this point but I was so hungry and had waited this long already so figured what's a few more minutes. We'll it wasn't a few more minutes. When I walked out of their with food it was almost 2hrs later from start to finish. I didn't get a sorry, or there was a mix up... I was handed a bag by the hostess and she turned around and walked off.  Whatever right?! I get home and the order is wrong and the food is cold. I had someone with a food allergy who couldn't eat tomatoes and asked it not be put on any of the items. I decided there is no way I'm going back in so I called because I want my order fixed and I don't want to wait. Especially because it was almost $70. I call, explain I'm upset, and want to talk to a manager. Guess who hangs up on me, not once but twice. Yep the same rude hostess. Why was I not surprised.   The family and I have decided to not support this business anymore. Maybe management will eventually do their job and oversee the staff. Until then I won't be back.",

    "text": "This is probably our top choice for local eats, though we tend to avoid the restaurant on big game nights because of the overcrowding.  The food is always good, the portions are ridiculously large, and the prices are good. I find their Wisconsin hunting decor amusing, mostly because I've never seen anything even remotely close in Wisconsin.  We haven't had anything bad here, and we've probably tried everything at least once in our years of dining here. However, no matter what we're in the mood for that night, we always get the cheese curds.  They used to serve them with 2 sauces but they only offer one now. My husband loves the horseradish sauce and always has to specify that one and ask for extra. I just eat mine plain, because they don't need anything else.   While fried cheese curds are showing up on more menus, nobody does them better than Big Dogs. I'm always smiling after I bite into my first one and get the perfect cheese curd squeak. Maybe it's a midwestern thing, because hubby doesn't understand what I mean by that, but it makes me happy.  In fact, I can barely eat much food after eating the fried cheese curds, but I always try. I can personally recommend the salads, the sandwiches, the burgers, and the entrees. All of them. However, if you're going to be a cheese curd pig like me, I recommend another appetizer for dinner.. any of them, they're all good also.  We're not beer drinkers but I hear others say that their brews are always good, too.",

They have a huge selection of house beers, and they rotate often. If you play, they give free beers.   The Thursday night rib basket is really good, especially for $10. Happy hour is from 3-6. House beers, which are numerous, are all half price.",

    "text": "I'm being generous giving 3 rather than 2 stars because 2.5 wasn't an option. I'm not one to post bad reviews, but I've come here a few times and can't seem to find a reason to return again. The food is mediocre at best, at least with what we had. Service was ok, the server was super friendly both times but the food....just sucks.   Our first visit was chicken fingers and a patty melt.  Fingers were burnt black on one side.... the server said that's the way they come out. I sent them back and the other server said that is absolutely NOT show they come out and brought me fresh ones. Garlic fries were ok. As a lover of patty melts, I'm a self proclaimed critic and this one just sucked. The meat was bland, too much bland patty, barely any cheese for the \"melt\". The bread was soggy on the side that's down, which tells me it sat for a while before they brought it out.   Next visit - a client of mine wanted to eat there, so I obliged. She said she likes that she can smoke in the bar area. Ok, fair enough to have smoking options (I'm not a smoker, and the bar was NOT overly smoky)  But again, the food.... ugh. I ordered the steak sandwich combo with a brat. I asked for it to come with grilled onions and a side of mayo. I got neither. I got a bland steak and brat on a bun. When the waitress asked how my food was I asked again for grilled onions and mayo. She took my plate and brought me a new one with fried onions . Whatever. I ate it.   My boyfriend ordered the pastrami sandwich and it was a 3 out of 10. Tasted like packaged deli meat. With so many great food options out there, I'd recommend trying something else. My client had a burger. She said it was \"ok, and it's pretty hard to F up a burger\" ...she ate half and left the rest.   The atmosphere is good, the place is clean, and service is ok, I'm sure the drinks are good, but 5 out of 5 menu items we ordered are thumbs down.",

    "text": "Soooo a friend of mine took me here about a year ago for Trivia.  It was AMAZING.  So we decided to come here again in November.  That was a terrible idea, as it was one of the worst experiences of my life.    First, they moved Trivia from the HUGE INSIDE ROOM to the SMALL OUTSIDE PATIO WHERE IT IS COLD.   They have a few heaters, but if you aren't seated right beside them, they serve no purpose.  They have room for about....8 teams I think, as they only have \"community picnic tables\" so you have to share with other teams which means you have to be quiet because the other team is sitting beside you and can hear everything. We came 30-45 minutes before the game even started and COULDN'T EVEN GET SEATS.  The host kept having to tell people to scoot in and make room for everyone else.  It was absolutely terrible, and to make matters worse, around round 3, they had CLOSED THE INSIDE ROOM where they used to have Trivia, so it makes no sense to me why they don't put Trivia in that room.  They could seat more people, which mean make more money, but apparently they don't want to do that.  Service was absolutely the worst, it took us about 25 minutes to get drinks, and another 30 to actually order food.  It took us about 20 minutes to get the check, and some of our party had to go, so my friend paid for them so they could leave.  We had to flag the person down every time we wanted something.  I got the steak, which I ordered medium rare, I don't know how they managed to do it, but it was EVERYTHING BUT medium rare, parts of it were well done, parts were done, it was so bad I couldn't even finish it.   I  can't remember what my friend got to eat, but as soon as she finished she had to run to the bathroom she was so sick, then she had to go home.    So really, I wouldn't ever come here ever again, especially for Trivia, when they seem so understaffed as it is.",

Everything I had here was great!    I ordered the sweet and tangy wings, which were very good if you're a wing person.  I've been searching this city to no end for good wings, and these wings were definitely up to par.  I'll be going back soon to try them all.    The sticky garlic wings were also good, but didn't pack much garlic flavor.  I'd recommend asking for extra sauce. Still a good, crispy wing though   I built my own burger, and I was really satisfied with that too.  I went with ghost pepper cheese, jalapenos, grilled onions, and green chiles.  There was some kind of package deal that came with a beer too.    I finished my daughter's chicken fingers after my meal.. again, very good!  Chicken fingers are hard to mess up, but when was the last time you had chicken fingers that were actually great?   Big Dog's chicken fingers are great.    Needless to say, the beer menu is stacked; but I'll say it just in case.    For beers and burgers/bar food, this place really hits the spot.  There's both indoor and outdoor seating, a friendly atmosphere, and the service was fast and friendly.  All around great place for bar food and drinks.  Especially if you hit happy hour between 3 and 6.",

I like the atmosphere. Family friendly.   I ordered the fish tacos that come with tortilla chips. Display was nice. The fish however was burnt and it tasted like I was just eating burnt batter. I could see skin from the fish peeking out from underneath the batter, which maybe that's normal? But it didn't look appetizing and honestly, I could have gotten better fish tacos from Del Taco across the street. The tortilla chips tasted like it was on its last day of expiration date. Overall I wasn't impressed and didn't think it was worth $13.  Maybe the chef was having a bad day. My waitress Christina was very nice and attentive. (But not overbearing like some servers).   Keep in mind this review is for the fish tacos. Who knows, maybe the other dishes on the menu are 10/10. After this though I don't think I'll bother coming back to find out.",

    "text": "(ATTENTION NO DOGS ALLOWED INSIDE THE RESTAURANT) I came here today of all days on Father's day because we were in Vegas. I did not look this place up from Yelp, I found this restaurant on Google. The Google'rs said this place is 4 in a half stars? No way someone is paying for reviews.   First off you should know if you're coming here it's 40 minutes away from the stripe. My wife was upset because it was so far off but I wanted to make sure my fury friend had a space she was welcome also along with my family. We eventually got there after a few freeway changes and got down. It was blazing hot outside about 101 degrees at the time. We made our way for the main entrance and I opened the door and boom! Blown down with 50 tons of cigarette smoke clouds. I go Woah this can't be it, this place doesn't seem family friendly or dog friendly at all.   But I said no maybe I got the wrong entrance, so I walked through the patio area and made my way to another door thinking maybe I might have gone into a saloon instead of the restaurant. While I walked through the patio area I seen a couple at some picnic table trying to keep there two dogs in the baking sun. I thought Woah no water bowls at all for these poor little things? Wow maybe I should turn back but I said nay! Keep going maybe it's different inside this other door. Then this person yells to me \" just sit down!\" I turned around thinking it was my wife telling me rudely to sit down at picnic tables too but she turned around it was this little pint sized 20 something waitress with that oh so trendy nose piercing that all the basic girls have. She told me again real sturnly to sit down you can't go inside with your dog, no dogs are allowed inside the restaurant! oh thats strange but your thing is dogs though? I guess it's just the name. I said fuck this and left and had myself a delicious steak at Caesars Palace.   But I couldn't figure out where the waitress came from she just popped out of nowhere. I asked my wife on the drive back where did the waitress come from? She said she was sitting there the whole time chatting with her friends. So she was just sitting there and she watched me pass her by and she didn't even say anything until I I actually made my way for the door. So my summation of this restaurant is this place and there service is real dog shit. They should name this place dog shit saloon because that's what it is.",

I also got the peppered rib eye sandwich on the recommendation of Chelsea (she's awesome sauce ). The sandwich is huge and the french fries are yummy .. The prior visit I got the Santa Fe grilled cheese which also rocks but its super spicy for those who aren't a fan go with one of the other grilled cheeses and you won't be disappointed..

Granted this was a Friday night and it was hoppin' but we spent over 2 1/2 hours and were seated immediately.  Our server didn't take our order for close to an hour, a manager finally came to check but she had just taken the order. Too bad that's the only time she checked on us!!!  Once the food came out we never saw her again until the bill came. Even then it took 10+ minutes to get change!  I think I saw her tending to 5-6 tables in the dining room PLUS the private party in the silo. Really poor staffing!!  Hate to say, the food was definitely not up to its normal standard.  Even my dad mentioned that the food was sub-par and he never complains!  I don't see us coming back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Went to Draft House for dinner with the family not thinking about it being St. Paddy's day. When we arrived we were prepared to leave but decided to see what the wait time would be... hostess said it would be 20 to 30 minutes due to a family of 11 before us ( I mentally added 10 minutes for the just in case ) so we decided to since it would take about the same amount of time to go somewhere else & eat we chose to stay. After 45 minutes and at least 4 - 5 other parties being seated before us when I inquired with the manager was told that we she didn't have a table big enough for 6. Once seated the busser was prompt in taking our drink order & he was quick to get them, we ordered an appetizer at that time with him, the waitress finally came by our table to let us know she had put that order in and it would be out shortly we did not get the opportunity to tell her we were ready to order so we had to wait another 20 minutes for het to come & to  take our order. All total it took 30 minutes in between ordering & getting food orders. Did not get refills on drinks. Food was not the best ( have had worse but have had much better ). By the time we were ready to leave I had to go track down the manager to get our ticket to pay. She did apologize for making us wait to be seated & did discount the meal ( which was considerate of her ). I did tip the server but if she would have been as attentive to us as she had been the big table seated after us her tip would have been better. When it is busy we do take into consideration when evaluating our service that we receive and do try to be patient, unfortunately even keeping those things in mind and have been loyal customers of Big Dogs in the past I am sorry to say that dinner today has fallen way short of what we used to have. Still not sure if we will go back, time will tell.0",

It was gigantic with a really good brat on top. The burger was cooked very good and had a great flavor. It was way too big to eat and super messy, but I still really liked it. I also for the fries on the side and they were hot, crispy and fresh.   Definitely would come back again!",

FOOD/DRINKS:      Ordered a beer that was on their menu, and written on their chalkboard - they didn't have anymore of that kind. Ordered another beer, that they had a photo/sign of in their bar, but they didn't carry that one. So I ordered a sampler of what beers, they did have, and that they brewed. Beer was good.       Ordered buffalo wings, buffalo chicken strips, and Nachos. The food came out in decent time, the buffalo wings were actually better than expected but the onion rings were on the \"soggy\" side. The chicken strips were a bit under-par, and the nachos were actually good in size and good in quality.   SERVICE:      Eehhhh, got me here. Did not get greeted, and it took quite some time for us to actually have a waiter walk up to us, after we even tried flagging one or two down. After that, they did serve us well though.   FACILITY:     Parking is great but the place inside is a bit on the older, darker side. The bar had a \"Northwoods Inn\" feel which could be good in ways, but bad in others. Table was clean, and bathrooms were well kept.",

The line and wait for beer sampling was longer than I can remember ever experiencing at any previous beer fest.   Good people and good times. Maybe we just got there too late, we got there at 7 and usually get there at the start (5pm). So many of the beers that we wanted to sample were already tapped out. :(. It was still a great time. We met some fun people while waiting in line. The music/band was AWESOME!   Definitely a good time even though we didn't get to try the beers we wanted to. The other options were just as tasty.",

This is definitely a place were the locals hangout.   The owner must be from Wisconsin because you get that vibe going in (for goodness sake cheese curds are their most popular item). I ordered their Holy Cow! Pale Ale. It was good, but I've definitely had better. Same could be said for the Southwestern Steak Salad. Average at best and to be quite honest I was disappointed with the small and dry portion of steak on it.   Overall, I'm glad I stopped in, but probably won't ever be back. Not a bad establishment, just not my taste.",

There are plenty of tables and extensive menu including ones for kids.    I used the dining area with my friend.  We ordered the Ahi salad and the Hot Pastrami Burger.  The salad was fresh and the burger was fantastic.  Burger comes with a patty topped with pastrami plus a pickle spear, lettuce, and 2 slices of tomato.   For the side, you can get regular fries or garlic fries.  I had the garlic fries and it was delicious.  You can see they change out the oil because the fries weren't dark.  Our waitress was attentive and very helpful.  She took our order, brought out our drinks, and food all within 15 minutes.    The dining area wasn't loud and we ate here at lunch time on a Sunday.  Kids are definitely welcomed here.    Definitely recommend this establishment.",

We ordered those and I had the pecan crusted walleye with the garlic/herb fries. The tartar sauce tastes homemade and was a great compliment to the fish.

It was quite lively since there was a Vegas Golden Knights game playing. They also had some outside function with games in their outside seating. We ended up eating inside the restaurant at a booth.  Inside the restaurant there was a variety of table and booth seating. There is TVs situated inside the restaurant at pretty much every corner. We were greeted by the waiter and immediately provided drinks.   The menu has quite the offerings, but typical bar food like burgers, bratwursts, salads etc.. I ended up selecting their bratwurst burgers with garlic french fries. My friend ordered a salad.  Our ordered had arrived within 20 minutes. The food portions are quite large, so be prepared to bring back food for a next meal! The bratwurst burger was quite flavorful. I had ordered my burger medium to well-done. It wasn't burnt. I had also ordered my burger special, with just cheese, bratwurst, hamburger. Big Dog's got my order correct!   My favorite part about the meal was the garlic french fries! I love garlic. It's one of my favorite seasonings! The garlic french fries were drenched with garlic. It was amazing! I would come back to this restaurant just for the garlic french fries!  The customer service was fantastic. Our table was checked on every 10 minutes or so. We didn't wait long for our meal or check!",

After sitting at a table for over 15min with no service and choking on random cigarette smoke we decided that this place was definitely not for us. Looking back I'm actually glad because the overwhelming cigarette smell that creeps into the dinning area is absolutely disgusting. Not a fan of giving local places 1 star reviews however, it is what it is.  Block off that stank cigarette smell, clean the place up and be more attentive to your customers. Truly wouldn't want to eat anything out of a kitchen that smells like an ashtray.",

We're huge dog lovers so we loved all the dog themed decor throughout the restaurant. I ordered the smokehouse bbq burger with garlic French fries and it was super good! Flavorful and tasty with just the right amount of spice. The fries were so tasty too and had fresh garlic on them. My husband really enjoyed his Philly cheesesteak with onion rings. Our son got he PB&J French toast with fresh watermelon slices on the side and he loved it. My husband also really liked the leg lifter lager, it had a great flavor and was nice and light. We stopped and got the underbite tee shirt on our way out because the shirt was so cute. We'll for sure be back!",

My most recent trip was on a Saturday in the early evening. It was busy, but not terribly crowded. We were greeted and seated promptly, but that's about where the promptness ends.  The food here is great. The selection of Big Dog's brews is great. The staff is always friendly. The only downfall here is slow service. Every time I visit, the service seems to be on the slow side. I'm not sure if it's the wait staff, the kitchen crew, the bus boys or a combination of them all.  During the most recent visit, a friendly young gentleman came to the table and took the drink orders. We also ordered an appetizer, which never made it to the table. I ordered a Build-Your-Own Burger, for which you pay extra for toppings. This would not be much of an issue, if you got what you ordered. I opted for cheese, tomatoes and onion. I got cheese, tomato and lettuce. The burger itself was fantastic and the garlic fries (upcharge) were the BOMB!  I opted for the Dog Bite Pilsner to accompany my meal. It was frosty cold and tasted great.  The other two in the party opted for chicken fingers and the 'Ol Smokey Burger. We were all impressed with the cuisine and the portion sizes. It just seems to take awhile. Tina was friendly and attentive, once she made contact with us after being seated.  I will return and, if the speed of service improves, will gladly update the review to the four or five stars they are very capable of achieving.",

A tasty IPA, a delicious roasty coffee hinting stout, a pale ale of near perfection, and no doubt everything they do is handled equally well. Runs a bit dark, and has a pleasant, friendly atmosphere that's a refreshing change from the general bleakness of the Chicago Brewing Company. Definitely worth a visit if you're up for hanging out and drinking good beer. And probably quite a few more visits after that. Cheers.",

They have a separate dining area which is good if you want to get away from the smoke.  Menu items differ somewhat from the other location- you can't get fish tacos here, but you can get some other fat- and cholesterol-laden goodies such as Spicy Mac N' Cheese (with jalapenos).

For the entree, the trio of fried perch sliders were awesome!  served with real french fries and delicious root beer that tastes homemade.  Great food and a great game (it's about time) by GB winning 33-7.  The place is filled with packer memorabilia and staunch fans galore.  Would give it 5 stars except for limited seating on a very busy day and a snafu by the kitchen regarding our nachos, but that happens anywhere  Otherwise, very friendly bar and alot of fun!  They serve real wisconsin walleye after 5 for dinner with baked spud and salad. Plan to go back to try that!",

A few weeks ago David and Lee gave my friends and I great service and I've been meaning to review on Yelp what a great job they did for us.  We've been getting great service from David for many years and he is super nice, hard working, and super fast and attentive service.  My friends and I even would joke on occasion at another bar saying how our bartender at Big Dogs could out serve 2 or 3 other bartenders at other bars because they are always talking or watching the games and not paying attention to  the customers needs.  Hopefully David will turn up in a NW bar nearby and we can find a new favorite place to hand out!  Amazing the poor decision some businesses make and David WAS the reason we came back.  We LOVE and EXPECT great service and knew where we could find it.  Since I'm a marketing consultant, I see poor decisions by businesses everyday that costs them lots of money, so I'm never too surprised.  I'm sure when they see their loses in sales, they will have no clue as to why, lol.  I see it everyday.",

At Big Dog's an order of wings isn't just fried and covered in anonymous sauce, they're \"twice baked\" and seasoned with zesty Cajun dry rub- Amazing. I've tried half a dozen entrees and everything has been flavorful and tasty. Portion sizes are decent as well.  Big Dog's is a great gastropub- both the food and beers are a quality draw.

    "text": "I like this place.  I used to LOVE it!  Yea, it's old. It's been there for a long time.  It always seems clean to me, although we usually sit in the bar area.  I think in the dining room, the booths might be a little worn & springy (not in a good way), although I haven't been back there in a while.  The food is always tasty.  I've never eaten a bad item from the menu and their custom brews are always good.  I like the \"38 special\" which is a mix of their red hydrant ale (a bit to bitter on its own) and their original pale ale.  It's a perfect blend IMO.  They have great burgers and I used to love the Big Dog's salad.  The downside:  Over the past several years, the Big Dog salad got smaller and smaller, even though it went up in price.  It used to be big enough for 2 meals.  Now it's barely filling for 1 meal.  I know that happens all over.  I don't like it...  thumbs down!  The service has also become spotty.  It's kind of a crap-shoot and it can depend where you sit.  I used to like to sit in the bar, on the side by the door, where there's a long row of tables with booth type seats on one side and stools on the other.  I found the service there is way lacking most of the time... it's further from the kitchen.  If I'm in the mood for a beer and a burger out, this is good place to go.  Was there last night, about 10:45 and they only had a \"late night\" menu.  It said served 11pm-8am.  I was expecting the regular menu.  It took a very long time for anyone to acknowledge us.  In fact, we first went to sit in my old favorite spot because the other side was full.  There was a bus boy at a nearby table who didn't even acknowledge us.  I said, \"lets move\" when I noticed tables at the end of the bar, so we'd be a little closer to the action.  That bus boy finally came back to ask if we wanted drinks and said he'd be back with menus (why not show up with menus?).  It actually took a very long time to get menus and we were super hungry.  I considered leaving because it was also taking a VERY long time for our waitress to make her first appearance.  I was concerned it might take forever to get our food, etc.  My guy wanted to stay when he saw her approaching our table.  It was cool, after she took our order she was on it the rest of our visit.  She even brought him another soda when his was only half gone...  nice!  Like I said, spotty service, up & down...  we actually got both last night, lol.",

A burger and some fries about $10-12 bucks. I can easily power down a meal here and not be completely full. Not a bad place I just think they are a little chintzy on the portions.  How about some more fries of something?",

My favorite sandwich has roast beef, horseradish, muenster cheese...might be the pot roast sandwich?  Fries are yummy and their potato cakes are good.  The service is always great.  The value is good, usually plenty left if you want to take some home.    The location on Sahara isn't kid-friendly, and this location on Rancho is much bigger, no smoking in the main dining area, and has a kids menu.",

The grad party that was part of the package was a bit of a let down. The flyer said we were getting appetizers paired with our beer. Well, we got one app. Yes it is semantics, but I figured we were getting at least 3 apps since you said appetizers (plural). The growler was part of the package as well. When we got our certificates, one of them was for a refill. Well, it's semantics again, but when it says \"refill\", that says to me that the growler had been filled at least once. We  were told that the certificate was really only for our first growler.  Overall, we had a good time. I just think it needs to be more clear what you are providing.",

I ordered a few drinks before they got it right I was gratefull they took the margarita and the margarita rasberry \"special\" drink back because they were really strong and not tasty.  However, the Pina Colada was really good.  Shocking right?  LOL The beer I heard was pretty good too.  A great place to have greasy cheesy appetizers and fun food.

The trivia side of this post will be short because it was not great.  They segregated the trivia player's into a corner of the restaurant and the acoustics were just awful.  You could barely hear the questions and the area had about 8 tables pushed together so there wasn't much room.  Still, the main review is about the beer.  I did not have food, but i certainly tried some beer.  Bg Dog's has the most extensive selection of self-brewed beer in the city.  Their Big Dog IPA is very highly regarded (I concur), and their imperial stout is actually very underrated (and very high in alcohol content) as well.    For the beer, please come to Big Dog's.  They usually have some deals with some of their beers and give them great sales prices for the night.  They also have many guest taps in the restaurant.  The beer selection is actually quite good in terms of numbers because Big Dog's brews about 20 beers, in addition to the 10-15 guest taps.  My biggest complaint is that they do not put prices on their beer list.  If you ask they will tell you the price (they said most were between $5-$7) but one of my biggest pet peeves at bars is when they omit the price so that deducted a star on its own.",

However, I was there recently for the Peace, Love and Hoppiness Festival that they put on yearly. Too bad the weather didn't cooperate, because this could have been a really great event. That being said, the staff did a great job of accommodating everyone who ran inside during this massive rain storm! It probably worked out better for the bar, since everyone went inside to eat and order from the bar.  The beer selection was pretty darn good! Quite a lot of people left once the storm took over, so once the rain and wind died down, there was more beer for the rest of us!  I liked that it was basically a free event if you weren't drinking. You could buy a mug and tokens as you went, or you could buy a large amount of tokens. It was well organized and I may just make it back next year!  I've previously been to Big Dog's to eat - the cheese curds were calling me! They are delicious, as is the other food I've tried. The service is generally pretty good and there is plenty of parking. As I said at the beginning - I just wish it were closer to me! Maybe Big Dog's should open a 2nd location!!  Oh - and the patio out front is dog friendly, which we need more of in Vegas!",

In my opinion, Big Dog's is one of the better breweries in Las Vegas - I love the War Dog IPA. We also love their menu(although they got rid of the broccoli salad which was fantastic): the Camp Randall is fabulous, the Bratzle is also to die for and the cheese curds can't be beat. We have not eaten anything we didn't like at Big Dog's. They also have great pulled pork and the pizza is not bad either. The recently added outdoor patio seating is a great place to dine - when the weather permits, of course.",

We went early afternoon, before the dinner crowd showed up, so we had no problem waiting for a table or service.  Our server was a lovely young lady, who also lived in Minnesota for some time. The Wisconsin cheese curds were the best I've had since living in the southwest. They were almost perfect! I had the Cheesehead burger (begrudgingly due to its name) and it was cooked to perfection on a toasted bun.  The fries were really good and the pickle was actually crispy.  The freshly brewed iced tea was also pretty good, and the servers were on top of getting us refills before we realized we needed refills.  Also, they have the Galaga arcade game in the lobby area, that's always a plus for me. :)",

These are a few of my favorite things: Mirror Pond beer Wisconsin Cheese Curds Big Dog's Salad The Bratzel  That's more than a few things, but these are the things I eat the most when I go.  There is also a jukebox there which is a must for my boyfriend...it sucks when other people only want to play country music. I'm from Oklahoma, and I can't handle one after another. The only other downside, a lot of people smoke. That is one of the only things I hate about Vegas. You should not be allowed to smoke indoors and make other people suffer, but that's another subject.",

It is hard to be a successful craft brewery out here because the water sucks.   (Water in my opinion is the most important and one of the most outstanding ingredients in beer)  Like stouts? Try theirs. They have a fantastic Light Beer called \"Leg Lifter\" that is a great novice beer to introduce to those that are unfamiliar with craft beer. Let that deter you from greedy beer giants like Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors and become apart of the revolution.  The Packers, I could care less about but they don't scare me away from this place. I recommend this place even to Bear fans. The staff and regular basis seems to be pretty open minded to the barback/buss/support guy who wears a Bears jersey everyday hahahaha.  Wish the bartenders would be a little more passionate about the product. They don't really seem to care to elaborate on their beers to those interested. Let me hear about it man, I know you would probably care more if I put 20 dollars in one of your machines!",

I can say as a fellow bartender, how can you possibly expect your staff to give great service if they don't have the basic tools to do the job?? He did a great job, all things considered but I don't know that I would comes back here to eat late night again. The bartender is awesome, but should at least have something printed to present for a menu. I would come back to see him for drinks,  but that's prob it.

It's a pretty reasonable beer garden.  For $30, you received a glass pint glass and $30 tokens for beer.  This year featured 50 beers to choose from but a majority of them were IPAs or heavier.  I don't mind a super heavy/dark beer once in a while but it's difficult for most people to spend an evening consuming IPAs.  Another thing was that 2 of the lighter beers were out early in the night further limiting the choices.    Overall it was a good time.  The bands were at a reasonable volume, it was outside, eclectic group of people and a good price for a Saturday night out.",

Btw, it was a very unfair ending, so if you decide to comment on this review, please do not say anything about this game.  It's kind of a sore subject. LOL.  When you drive up you're greeted with a couple of unforgettable pieces.  First is the huge house shaped sign that welcomes you to the joint.  On the way in, there's also a very large dog statue with a sign that says, \"do not climb on dog.\" They shouldn't have put that there.  Later in the evening, our curiosity prompted us to ask the server to climb the dog.  When we got the 'good to go,' we literally took a thousand pictures on that statue.  Awesome.  The inside is pretty huge.  It actually reminds me of a local pub in Wisconsin.  Pictures, awards, Wisconsin shaped everything!  The bar is definitely the center piece of the establishment.  It takes up 50% of the joint.  TV's everywhere make it easy keep track of the game.  The staff was super nice.  Our server was on point.  She really made us feel at home.  I loved the ambiance.  Totally my kind of place!  The cool thing is the fact that they have a line of their own signature brewskis.  We got a total of 4 pitchers of the Leglifter Light.  This American style light lager alternative is mild in flavor and super refreshing.  With only 4% ABV (alcohol by volume), it is sure to keep you going throughout the game.  For our food, we started off with the Wisconsin Cheese Curds for $10.  It's white cheddar cheese curds, breaded and fried golden. Served with homemade dill horseradish sauce & ranch dressing for dipping.  Man, this was good!  If you like cheese, you will love this!  The breading was crunchy and flavorful.  Curds were perfectly salty.  We also got the full order of Doghouse Nachos for $14.00.  Chips with cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos, olives, sour cream, scallions, salsa & guacamole.  This bite reminded me of stadium nachos.  Nothing special, cheese from a can.  Lastly, we got the Chicken Wings for $9.00.  It's served with celery and carrots. You can choose to have the wings plain, BBQ, medium, hot, spicy chipotle or honey hot.  We asked for half BBQ and half medium.  The wing was crispy and perfectly fried.  The mild sauce was my favorite.  The actual sauce didn't seem to over power the wing and really showcased the chicken taste.  The BBQ, on the other hand, seemed to really over power the wing for me.  Super sweet flavor. If they used a little less sauce, I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more.    After all brews and food, our bill was $80 for 4 people.  That's a deal.  It's definitely a far drive, however, it is Packers/Badgers season.  It's time to man up and return there for game time.  I'm so happy I found a Packers/Badgers bar that I actually enjoy!",

Especially since we we're leaving a bigger tip since we were a BIGGER party.   Next, the food was mediocre. Nothing special yet the prices we're a little higher than expected. Burgers tasted the same as carls or dennys. The only thing that made me jump for joy were the cheese curds. Mmm. Sound so disgusting but taste oh so good.   If i came back it'd be for the old cheese fat ;)",

Asked for to-go boxes then had to ask for check after that. Food was mediocre. I got the smoked mac and cheese. Flavor was ok but tasted like velveeta cheese sauce and noodles were over cooked. Fried cheese curds were good! You can smoke in part of the restaurant but the smell carries to the non-smoking section. There was a art print on the wall at our table and it looks like there were several food fights ages ago. Needs to be wiped off like the table. Had a house stout that was the highlight.",

The decor and memorabilia was just great . . . and being able to see the brew kettles made it even better.  Had there beer of the day . . . and while it was good and tasty . . . it could have been a bit colder.  Ordered the Bid Dog Nachos with Grilled Chicken . . . typical bar nachos . . . but the chicken tasted a bit like deli chicken . . . and not fresh grilled chicken.  I am probably giving it an extra star . . . being from Wisconsin . . . but with a little work on the beer temperature and updating ingredients, this place good be a GREAT sports bar.",

    "text": "I have to take off a star and hope I don't have to take anymore.   Part of the reason why it was comfortable to be here is the night time staff was friendly and attentive. We sat in our usual table and even though the bartender was stuck behind a bar he still walked over and asked periodically if we're still doing alright.   The BF and I went in and there was a bunch of new staff. We walked up to the bar to order to go last week since we didn't feel like hanging out and having beers. The bartender and the bar back ignored us a good 5-10 or so minutes even though they were not busy. They were even having a conversation directly in front of us and ignoring that I'm looking right at them. I was just sitting there like WTF? and debating on leaving if another 5 more minutes elapse.   There was a girl who seemed to have come up to the computer to check something (she was on her break) and she stopped midway walking away and asked if we needed something since I probably looked cranky sitting there. She put in our ticket and put the check in front of us. I put my card and the whole time the bartender never acknowledged us, never came by to take my card. He's even joking around and dancing to the music, but no time to payout my bill.   Even when our food was ready, he just handed us the bag. My bill still wasn't paid because he didn't want to take it the 20 minutes I was there waiting for my order. Good thing I'm a honest person so I waved my card to be taken instead of cheesing it. Then he went to the computer and rang up 2 other people first, gave them all their papers before getting to me who was the only to-go order needing to get home before my food gets cold.   Ugh, I surely hope this guy isn't the new regular night bartender because he doesn't know how to time manage nor the A,B,Cs of service. If the next time I come in and it's the same guy and none of the waitresses are working, I'm walking back out. Serious- I won't scratch my eyes out to get service at a place I raved about as a friendly, attentive neighborhood bar.",

I really came here to watch the Packer game since this is a Packer bar, so that was a lot  of fun. EVERYONE  was wearing packers gear and it made me feel right at home!

Saturday I had their September Saturday night promotion Tri tip steak dinner. Excellent trip tip & tasty sauce, mashed potatoes, corn for $13. Tasty bargain. Their quarterly beer festivals are a great way to try some tasty beers.  Only two things wrong with Big Dogs. First, Packers bar. Second, smoking like rest of LV but they do have a no smoking restaurant section plus a great relatively new expanded patio.",

The first time I went was for their War Dog tapping party. I actually had another anti-teetotalism gathering at the Freakin' Frog that night. But I had always wanted to try Big Dog's, so I did the mini-road trip from work (near McCarran) all the way up to the great northwest. I was hoping to get there in time for a free appetizer, but that didn't work out. I ended up just getting my free pint of War Dog and leaving. Let me just say that the War Dog IPA is delicious.  By the way, I then turned around and made another mini-road trip back down south to the Freakin' Frog to meet up with my friends. Ken M says I deserve a beer badge for making that beer venue combo in one night.  My second visit to Big Dog's was for their Winterfest. Great event. I went with the 30-token + tasting glass starter pack for $30. I really didn't drink that much beer. My 30 tokens got me the following:  * Half pour of Big Dog's Raspberry Brewbie SupPorter. Yeah this was more like a full pour. Very tasty and part of the proceeds went toward the Keep a Breast Foundation. * Quarter pour of New Belgium's La Folie Sour Brown Ale. Despite it's supposed \"limited quantity,\" they gave me more like a half pour. Not complaining! This was extremely sour, kind of like Sour Warheads. It was worth trying, but not sure if I'd ever order it at a bar. * Half pour of Big Dog's Doghouse Dunkelweizen. Didn't like this all that much. * Half pour of Deschutes' Hop in the Dark Cascadian Pale Ale. Absolutely delicious! Probably my favorite beer of the afternoon. * 2 bowls of Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo. Obviously delicious, since I went back for seconds. * 1 bowl of Chile Verde. Good flavor and spice. * 2 Oyster Shooters. Made with Black Lab Stout. Surprisingly delicious.  So I have yet to go to Big Dog's for a non-event. I definitely will return one day though. I still need to try their Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds (and compare them to Aces & Ales).  Oh and I love that it's a Packers bar. I'm not a huge Packers fan, but it would be fun to catch a game there maybe next season.",

I met a few friends there for Sunday Night Football last week, on their recommendation.   The place has a pretty cool set up. Large bar when you first enter with tons of TV's set up everywhere. We decided to all grab a bite while we were there, so we headed to the back to a dedicated dining area. The area in teh back is a bit quieter, with tons of TV's set up as well.  Service was okay. Nothing spectacular, nor anything horrible. Could have been better. Could have been worse. I wanted to try one of their brews, but unfortunately their \"Leg Lifter\" light beer was out. I opted for the Dirty Dog instead. It was alright.   I ordered a Cheesehead burger with fries ($11.50). The burger was pretty good size, but kind of dry. The fries were nothing special either. They reminded me of Jack in the Box fries.  Basically everything was just okay. I would probably give this place another chance one of these days, but it's not very likely since I live on the other side of town.   I wavered between 2 or 3 stars on this one, but I really want to give this place the benefit of the doubt...so....  3 stars.",

In Las Vegas, there are so many restaurants, it's kind of overwhelming. The pics for Big Dogs Draft house looked AMAZING! Sadly, that's where the amazement ended. My pictures look great as well. As far as the taste of the food? It left much to be desired. I will say the Pastrami burger that my son got was very, very good. But my chicken and artichoke Mac and cheese was not amazing. I am a foodie and I LOVE cheese. The flavor just wasnt there. I can't remember now what cheeses is said it had, gruyere was one, but it sounded great! Didn't taste that way. I think I found 2 chunks of artichoke in the whole thing. Just so-so overall. Would not order again. My husband ordered a steak. It had AWESOME steak flavor... But I seriously think they forgot to season it!! I'm not kidding!! There was no salt on it, and I use salt very, very sparingly!!  It doesn't taste the same when you add salt after the fact... Again super disappointing for a $24 steak dinner.  We ordered:  Pastrami burger Kids pizza meal with drink Chicken Mac and cheese Steak with 2 sides 3 beers 1 root beer ($6??) 1 Dr pepper 1 order of cheese curds Our bill was $93.

    "text": "Las Vegas Brewery tasting Tour stop number 2.  I give this one 5 stars because it is also a Packer's Bar during football season.  Being a Cheesehead that's a PLUS.  However the Dirty Dog IPA is top notch for sure.  Not only does it have a decent Alc % but the flavor was very hoppy and flavorful but had a very smooth finish.  I am not sure the IBU on that beer and I do not think they had it posted but this beer was very easy to drink.  By the looks of the beer menu Big Dog's had over a half dozen beer's made in house from all varietals of beer styles.    Food menu had some great choices of hearty stick to your bones dinners like Pot Roast.  Also to choose from were a great selection of burgers patty melts and Wisconsin's finest sausages from Klements and Johnsonville Brats.  I will be definitely trying one of these on my next visit.  Reading the menu I can envision a pile of gut busting goodness of grilled onions, peppers and links slathered in mustard.  Ah, but we will conquer this dish next time.  I chose the \"Draft House\" burger which came out of the kitchen quickly and cooked to a perfect and juicy medium just like I requested.  I paired this monster with the waffle cut sweet potato fries that came out dusted with powdered sugar.  This burger was no Joke! I am sure it was a 1/2 lb with cheddar with thick cut crisp bacon, LTO and grilled mushrooms.  Awesome!.  That burger was no match for me that day.    You can look at the magic happening while they are making the beer from inside the bar area with the windows looking right at the fermentation tanks. Big Dog's has several seating areas including a bar, restaurant and patio area.  During football season it is almost impossible to find an empty seat in the Dog House.  Packer fans come out in droves to support their team and sip pints of Big Dog Brews.  Once in a while they host a beer festival on property showcasing all of their fine Suds.  Big Dogs is a must try on my list of Brewhouse stops in Las Vegas.  I recommend visiting on a Sunday while football season is in full swing for an amazing fanatic experience.  Unless.... your a Bears fan.",

    "text": "First off, I'm from Wisconsin, so I was SUPER excited to try this place! I had the Walleye, which I have not had since I left Wisconsin. The fish tasted very fresh, and they managed to pan fry it without drying it out, so I was pretty stoked. The Sweet Potato fries left something t be desired, they were thin cut waffle fries, so they lost all their sweet potatoes goodness. I tasted the beer cheese soup, even though I don't tolerate dairy, I had to have a bite of someone else's just for a taste of home. It was delicious! Highly recommend if you like dairy.   Fried Cheese Curds.. even when I lived in Wisconsin, I have always felt frying a cheese curd was sort of a defilement of something beautiful, so I am not a good person to ask if they were any good. But they were there, and others in my party seemed to enjoy them.  Overall, everyone in my group loved their food, and it reminded me of home. I loved walking around inside and seeing all of the Wisconsin Badgers, GB Packers, and Wisconsin license plates. It was all very exciting, I loved it.   Extra points for having a pet friendly patio and nice waitstaff, and great beer! This was a definite must stop, and I am glad I don't live near enough to go there a lot, because I would get very fat!",

My boyfriend and I ordered nachos no meat - the reason for my 3 star rating is because of the nachos. The chips were stale and the cheese melted into this hard glue-like substance.  We are them because we hadn't eaten anything substantial all day and we were famished.   The service was good - the atmosphere was fun. I didn't care much for the outdoor activities but I am not a beer drinker. Overall we had a good time just next time we will stay away from the nachos.",

My family and I ordered the cheese curds which are usually very good, but I was completely appalled when I found a LIVE fly swimming in the ranch which we had already ate most of. I proceeded to get up to tell our waiter about the fly and they said they would send out a manager. The manager never showed up and all the waiter did was give us a $5 off coupon and deducted out partially eaten cheese curds. I didn't even eat my food and the waiter decided to ask me if I wanted dessert and when I replied no, he said \"Oh too full?\" Not too full, my food was untouched because I completely lost my appetite. Horrible experience. Never going back.  UPDATE: After posting this review, I was contacted by the general manager about the issue. I was very pleased that my review was taken into consideration and he advised me that corrective actions will be taken. I appreciate him taking the time to give me a phone call and trying to fix the mistake that was made. The dining experience was not the best but the customer service was well done.",

There was 5 small pieces of chicken, no flavor, and it was buried under lots of sauteed red peppers, the chicken didn't taste fresh, nor did it taste like it was from premium white chicken breast. The chicken portion was so little. It came with 5 small corn tortillas,  I guess the idea was to have one piece of chicken for each tortilla, and get filled up on a heaping side of dry rice which tasted like it was a day old, and a heaping side of mediocre coleslaw. My husband's corn on the cob had small kernels that were shriveled up. His Steak was cooked the way he asked though. But not flavorful. Unfortunately, this place was a disappointment. Never again.",

Walked in the door and stood at the hostess podium for 10 minutes before anyone one even acknowledged us...many servers walked by and made eye contact and would walk away but not a single one acknowledged that we were even standing there...not a single \"hi\" or \"someone will be right with ya\". Finally one of the servers said she would go find the host...when the host finally came out instead of acknowledging the 2 people standing in front of her, she decided to pick the phone up instead and ignore us some more. So the server that went to get the host saw this and said she would seat us instead. We sat down...she took our drink order and brought it out promptly. She then took our food order and left. Then the waiting began again...10 minutes...20 minutes...30 minutes and still no food. So when the food finally came out we were starving. Boyfriend had the rib special and I had the bratwurst...both were tasty! We finished our meal and we still have yet to see any sign of our server since the food was brought out. When she finally came back to the table, we ordered a dessert to-go...boy was that a mistake cause here comes the waiting game again...we waited another 20 minutes for the dessert came out before we could go home. Awful, awful service all around.",

    "text": "How often have Diane and I eaten at Big Dog's?  In the past two years, just about every Monday night when we are in Las Vegas--which is most weeks of the year--and sometimes on other nights as well.  We were big fans of its long gone sibling situated on the Strip across from the Sahara Hotel & Casino where SLS now stands: Holy Cow, and its fresh Walleye Pike flown in from Wisconsin.  So it was an easy jump for us to enjoy more of the same here--along with plump Pan-fried Pot Stickers so good that they do not taste in the least frozen.  And every time I have tried something new I have not been disappointed.  So my other staples are now the best Beef Stroganoff in town, a tangy Pulled Pork Sandwich, and a memorable Holy Cow! Reuben.  But until last night I had never before sampled a hamburger here, even though I have heard great praise for them.  To take it up a notch, for my first burger I opted for The Bratzel, a 1/3 pound hamburger patty conjoined under a Pretzel Bun with a juicy butterflied Klement's Smoked Bratwurst, along with strips of Applewood Smoked Bacon, slices of tomato, Cheddar and Swiss Cheese, fried sweet onions, and some lettuce.  After adding some mild yellow mustard and ketchup to my medium-rare burger, and I was in for a real treat--even though I could barely get my mouth around the whole concoction.  The brat inside was juicy, just like the great Kosher Dill Pickle slice that was impaled by a steak knife on top of it.  As always, French Fries, too, were first rate.  And the flavor of the Pretzel Bread fortunately did not overpower the taste of the meats contained within.  This is a heavy meat eater's nirvana, and I'm glad I finally became intimately acquainted with it.  Once again service by our server Maria M. was friendly, efficient, and exemplary; and every ordered dish brought out from the kitchen made precisely to order, and of the same consistent high quality as experienced on previous visits.  This is truly a beacon of fine comfort food in the Las Vegas valley.  May it continue to thrive and please local diners, Green Bay Packer backers, and tourists alike.",

I mean it's 2016 the Rat Pack hasn't been relevant for over fifty years. Can we please stop this? There's nothing worse than trying to enjoy your meal and a plume toxic smoke invading your space, you might as well eat in the toilet. That being said...  Beer time after skating my heart out at Crystal Palace, I came here for a post birthday party drink and snack with the birthday girl and her friends. This place is surprisingly big with plenty of tables, TVs and bar space to hang and sip a beer.   The menu is pretty much what you would see with any sports bar, chicken wings, burgers, brats and deep-fried everything. Although the one thing that stands out here is the cheese curds, deep fried little nuggets of cheese, battered, fried and served with horseradish sauce. I dare you to say no!   I went with Chicken Fingers, swimming in buffalo sauce and an order of French fries. I ordered the appetizer serving size and it came with six chicken tenders, spicy, crunchy and plentiful, really the perfect dinner option. The beers were good, but tasted pretty much tasted like something you'll get from Gordon Biersch or another chain brewery. I went with the Dirty Dog IPA it was good, but like said before nothing that really blew my craft beer taste buds away.   The three stars are for slow service, mediocre beers, and cigarette smoke in the air. Guys, can we just create a separate smoking area or just have people head outside.   It's really quite simple.",

The event was organized and they had some of the tastiest beer samples I have had in a while. It was a beautiful warm day to host the event outside with musical entertainment going on. Some folks brought their dogs so as time wore on, it got a little crowded.   There were a ton of beers to sample but my favorite was a Belgian ale at 9% alcohol so the samples were only a half glass. I had a couple and quite tasty. Hoping I can locate locally and purchase. There were a few food offerings, a chile verde and a bouillabaisse. My hubby and I enjoyed the chile verde. There was also the option of heading inside the Big Dog restaurant and enjoying some food.   I definitely will plan to attend the next festival is they did a great job on this one!",

I've been a few times now and each time the wait staff has been very attentive to us even though we always sit on the patio. My husband and I are always on the look out for places we can bring our black lab Jack along for dinner (we hate leaving him at home). So this place definitely fit the bill! Sometimes however we find if you sit outside the level of service is seriously decreased. That is not the case for Big Dog's! After one of us simply notifies the hostess inside that we'd like to sit on the patio they typically have someone come right out to attend to us.   I absolutely love that they constantly have new brew lists and highlight not only their own brews, but also plenty of local guest brews. My husband and I are big beer lovers so it's nice to have a place that's open 24 hours so close to home. I've tried a number of their in house beers and have never been disappointed (love their black lab stout, though I may be a little biased!). I've also enjoyed every guest brew I've tried as well.   Now on to the food, which is absolutely delicious. Seriously. They serve breakfast all day in addition to plenty of bar food and grandma's style cooking. This last time I tried their pot roast, and it was fall of the fork good. Loved every single bite.   So if you love dogs, beer, and good food you gotta give this place a try!",

I HATE sitting at barstools, but they had this weird sort of option of sitting on really tall padded benches against the wall. Slightly more comfortable, but the Anaconda said he felt like a little kid with his feet dangling.  Got the bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato waffle fries. Burger was well cooked and tasty, and the hot, crispy fries came with a thin, sweet dipping sauce that went perfectly. Baby Sis got a house specialty sandwich with bratwurst. She said it was good but I can't personally attest since I didn't actually get a bite. She never was good at sharing.  Service was fine- friendly staff who seemed a little overworked. Pleasant vibe- they played a lot of classic rock mixed with country hits which seemed to cover the customer base pretty well. (About half of which were chatting and happy while the others were hunched over the video poker machines in their own private hell. I feel your pain.)  Now for the part that, for me, lost them their fourth star, but ironically, made the Anaconda and Baby Sis want to give them 5: they let you smoke at the #@$! table! WTF!  Am I the only one who recalls a law passed not that long ago that prohibited smoking in food service areas? What the hell ever happened to that??!!   They sat there dreamily puffing away, declaring that it was such a treat not to have to go outside for their post-meal coffin nails, that this was their new favorite restaurant. I wanted to call the police.",

Also had some food, fish and chips and mac and cheese as well as cheese curds. All the food was good!

If you aren't a regular the service isn't so great. You have to wait even when you've asked for something before a person they know by name. Big dogs on Torrey pines should have never been shut down!   I will continue to go here for the pizza.

The bar area service is why I deducted a star, the last 3 times I have been there and sat in the bar area the service has been extremely slow. In their defense, I was recently there on a Friday evening during a NCAA tournament basketball game.   The soft pretzels are good, and great price during happy hour.  The cheese soup, and the nachos with shredded beef are worth a super long workout to negate the calories.  Burgers are good and you can get veggie burgers (Boca patties) even though I don't believe it is listed on the menu. My fave is a build your own on a pretzel roll, with green chiles, pepper jack cheese, and guacamole....I've gotten this combo with beef burger, turkey burger, or a veggie burger depending on my mood.   I was sad to learn on my last visit that one off favorites - the Mediterranean salad - was no longer on the menu. If anyone from Big Dog's reads this, I know I have spoken mostly of the delicious food porn options you offer, but more often than not i ordered that salad- please bring it back!

    "text": "I've been a semi-regular to regular attendee of the place since it opened back in the late 80's, and its certainly had its ups and downs in that time period.  Speaking for now, I consider it to be my \"home\" bar and rarely have an experience that's not positive.  The beer here is phenomenal, and they always have a great selection of craft brews that they make on site. No matter what you're in the mood for, there's always something there you'll like.  The food is almost always good. A lot of standard American fare, with some Wisconsin style dishes like their fried cheese curds (mandatory whenever you go there) and walleye. Their burgers are always great, as is pretty much anything else you get there. The only thing I've eaten there in recent memory that didn't really get my approval was their prime rib, which was very....okay. That's not a normal thing on the menu though.  Service also generally good, especially if Emily serves you. She's one of the best out there and will always make sure you're well taken care of. The other servers there are also mostly good, though some occasionally disappear for longer than you'd like leaving dry glasses when you want another round.  The environment is very welcoming and down to earth, but by no means trashy or low budget. Being a Wisconsin bar, there's tons of Green Bay stuff decorating the walls. If you're a Bears or Vikings fan, you have been warned. In terms of smoke, you'll come out of the place smelling like it, but there are plenty of air filters installed so you never feel like you're in a smokey bar.  Lately there's some points against it in that it's been extremely crowded as of late (can't really fault them for success, but as a patron it's a pain), and they've also installed a jukebox which means being subjected to loud, crappy music whereas they've always played classic rock and other quality tunes there (some of which is actually fairly obscure, so a music nut like me would jump for joy when you'd hear an old 70's progressive rock tune that you'd never hear on the radio).  One thing that I really wish they had is an established happy hour. The beers there are a little on the pricey side, and being able to swing by after work some days without a $30+ bill (food and a few beers) bill would be nice.",

I don't think I've ever had anything bad on the menu.  From the braetzel burger to the salads (how many bars have salads that are good?!?!) this place is fantastic.  The appetizers are one of our favorite items.  The cheese curds... beer cheese soup... not a great place for those who are lactose intolerant!    The beer itself is also good.  It was one of the first local breweries to serve craft beers.  Now I'm not going to lie- the bar is a smoke field and the bathrooms are well, bar bathrooms.  Because IT'S A BAR!!!  If you want fancy, go to the Strip.  If you want delicious local food in a super casual environment, come here.    Love, love, love this place.",

It just seems like the kind of place that you can roll up your sleeves and dig into some great food, maybe throw $20 into a video poker machine and relax with some friends over a few pints.  However, the bar staff was ridiculously rude and greedy.  There was one bartender for forty or so guests around a massive bar.  Every time a manager was called to the bar to answer some complaint about service or food or both, they would ask her if she needed help.  She would look around the bar and say \"nah its not so bad\" and then continue to give terrible service.  I ordered some type of brat-burger sandwich creation that I thought was going to save the experience, but it turned out to be a hotdog pretending to be a brat.  At least they did have a fresh pretzel roll to hide the hotdog.  This place seems like it could be awesome or has been awesome, but I just missed it completely.

No ready seating at the bar so they seated us in bar overflow. I thought this was going to be BS because we were not in the bar. Not so, the bar overflow is open and adjacent to the bar, features a large quantity of sports-tuned televisions, and has a waitress bringing you their glorious beer so all was well.  Food: Had the 9.99 ribs and fries. Really decent for a non-rib joint. Spectacular at 9.99 and consistent with the food I've had before- nothing exceptional just really well done classics and unusually good fish choices. This is not a gastropub, but that doesn't mean you won't leave happy and full. Prices are solid.  Beer: These guys make the best beer in Vegas. The brewery is on site and they actually have quite a lot of great Big Dog beer on tap here at all time. Considering the size of the operation they must run those things night and day. The guest taps are also spectacular: well chosen regional standouts and usually on tap. They also regularly have gatherings for new beer releases and they have consistent enough quality to make the trip always worth it.  Service: our waitress Shannon did something I have yet to behold here in Las Vegas. She split our check, and not only that, she did it happily, voluntarily, and without us asking in advance. I had not seen the like since I was in the Midwest (why is it they hate splitting checks out here?) She was great otherwise, but this was top notch.   Pro-tip: If you come here in a Bears Jersey they're probably going to take you to the back and play \"Abu Ghraib\" with you. Otherwise an amazing place to watch a football, especially a Packers game.",
