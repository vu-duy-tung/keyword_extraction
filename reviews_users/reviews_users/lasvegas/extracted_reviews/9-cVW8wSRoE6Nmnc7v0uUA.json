After being seated for breakfast on a weekday morning no one approached the table for 15 minutes. Mugs are on each table but coffee was not offered, had to ask for it. Food arrived 45 minutes later and was stone cold on a hot plate. How is that even possible? Took another 10 minutes to get someone's attention. Ordered something else and that took another 15 minutes. No one apologized. No one seemed to care at all.   They get 1 star as they're only a few steps from the guest elevators.   You'd be much better off going across the street to Denny's.",

The staff is fantastic and the portions are huge. I mean huge! I got the breakfast sandwich and I probably would not get that again. A little too big, a little too greasy, and a little too rich. The lady next to me had French toast with berries and she seemed very pleased. It was definitely a pretty dish. The hot chocolate is a must. They don't skimp on whipped cream!",

We loved how servers actually used the pantry in the back. We thought that little things such as the little milk jugs for creamers were a nice touch. The food itself was awesome. I got the cheddar biscuits with gravy and smashed potatoes, it was perfect and I'll for sure order that again.  Although pricey, its standard Vegas brunch prices and not totally unreasonable. We're looking forward to going back next time we're there!",

Service was excellent.  All the servers are extremely nice.  They even gave me a to go cup for my coffee!

I was really looking forward to waffle lit fries but they were very stale and hard.  The salmon dish was overall okay but the salmon itself was a very small piece, something that was surprising.

We were looking for a small and affordable breakfast. Two of us ordered a bagel, one ordered the yogurt parfait and the other ordered biscuits. We got the vibe right away that our waitress didn't like that we ordered small/inexpensive items. She rushed off to put our order in, brought our bills within 10 minutes and insisted we give her the cash we had sitting on the table under our bill .... before we were done eating! The tone and pushiness she had was very rude. We told her to keep the change for a tip, instead of keeping it she came back and slammed it on the table. We kept the tip. The biscuits were dry, the bagels were burnt and the parfait was ok, but expensive for what it was.",

You really don't have a good business unless you have good workers. These people are absolutely pleasant and on their a game. Definitely must check out if you're in Vegas!",

It tasted fine but what weirded me out was the cheese on my eggs. I asked for cheddar for my eggs, and technically they did do that, but it was literally a square slice of cheese just thrown on top of my eggs, slightly melted. It wasn't very good. Also, the bacon was so crunchy I felt like I was going to break my teeth on it. But the service was great, and the pancakes on the plate of the guy sitting next to me looked and smelled so good, I decided to give the Pantry another chance.  So the next day I came back, and I ordered blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes did not disappoint, and thankfully the bacon was the perfect level of crispy/chewy this time. The coffee was good again and the service was even better than before as well. My only critique is that I am pretty sure the \"maple syrup\" is not real maple syrup. But I didn't have the heart to ask because the guys behind the counter were so friendly and fun. Ultimately I let it go because I am aware that I can totally be a syrup snob, not unlike most Mainers.  I would come here to eat again if it wasn't in the Mirage. I am not sure I could ever go back inside that hotel because of the horrible air quality. I wish the Pantry people all the best for the future and I hope that they always have great pancakes!",

We got seated and our server was already standing there with a coffee in hand asking if we wanted some. We said yes, not knowing that we'd be charged 5 bucks because he didn't mention anything about an additional charge.   I ordered an omelette with spinach, mushrooms, and bacon w/ smash browns and wheat bread and my colleague ordered a white egg omelette with spinach and mushrooms w/o the smash browns and gluten free bread. The server came out with completely wrong orders! We were given two omelettes with the wrong fillings. The server apologized and blamed the person who took our order because apparently he always messes up orders. Talking crap about your coworkers to customers? Completely unprofessional in my opinion. I didn't care that my order was messed up so he gave me both the omelettes and returned to the kitchen to grab my colleague's egg white omelette and gluten free bread with fresh fruit on the house. We ended up taking our food to-go because we needed to leave for the convention and the whole order mishap took up our time. Don't waste your time here!!",

We were seated fairly quickly with the few standing in line.  Our awesome waiter was over immediately.  He did an outstanding job during his busy morning. I was quite impressed.    The feta and spinach scramble was calling my name.  It was served with smash browns and toast.  My meal was delicious! I certainly enjoyed the smash browns which were perfectly named.  Browned potatoes then smashed almost into mashed potatoes.  Yummy! The sourdough toast with their homemade strawberry jam was delightful!  If you're staying at the Mirage, the Pantry is a good choice for breakfast.  AND they serve breakfast at any time.",

Adding another 5 stars for their breakfast. Waiting can be long if you come between 8:30 and 10 but worth it.   My wife loved  granola parfait. We asked them which Granola they use, and the waitress said they make their own.  She had it both days we stayed here.    I had eggs benedicted. Made perfect. My kids had blueberry and chocolate pancake and not a single bite left. Thats the first.   Did I mentioned about best Bread pudding. We are taking one for the road!!!",

Thus, the appeal to come to Mirage considering all the great places around is gone.  Prefer Wynn.  Free parking too.  However, back to food: friend ordered the fried chicken which he said was excellent.   I tried some and it was delicious.   I had mahi mahi tacos which were done very well.  Fish was not dry and very tasty.  However when you add the parking for a few hours, I can think of other places to eat at.   Food is great but not cheap and when you add the parking, well, you can get better for that price.   Nonetheless, judging food and service only, give it 5 stars.",

Not my favorite thing to do but the hostess seems quite efficient and seats people as soon as she can. The menu is eclectic and fun. Service was okay. Food came out fast and tasted pretty good. The smash potato was the highlight of breakfast. The rest was okay but the potato was really yummy. I wish I had lunch or dinner but will have to do that some other visit. Only complaint is gat it is really noisy. All sounds Echo and folks are yelling. Make the music just more noise.",

I liked the schnitzel had sweet jam on it, it prevented the whole slab of fried meat from being boring. Also the french toast was good however it's a bit on the sweeter side.

They usually have somebody standing at the front to seat you for dining however I wanted my food to go and eat in my room! If this is the case then all you have to do is go right up to the bar and order from the bartender. The man who was working the night that we went was a tad bit rude but I really didn't think too much into it until when I asked for the food to be charged to the room. Apparently the front desk didn't do something correct and I was unable to do so. He ended up getting it fixed but it was the way he went about it that left a bad taste in my mouth. Food was great service wasn't so had to properly remove the what could've been 4th star for them. Will I return? it's possible...",

That would likely be the only reason for dining here or even knowing its existence.   Thus the reason I dined here twice.   Huevos rancheros were okay. It's hard to mess that up terribly, though. It's a safe order.   Chicken from the chicken and waffles were way under-seasoned. The crispness of batter was acceptable. The waffles were reminiscent of a sourdough pancake I had once. They were not good. In any case, even a good waffle would've been ruined by the fake syrup.   You're better off eating the buffet with these prices; at least if there's a miss there, you can move on to the next ten dishes. They're nearly side by side so they probably share a kitchen anyway.   The blueberry pancakes were pretty decent.",

The only good thing I can say about this place is that it is open 24 hours and after a night out on the town, they promptly had our to-go food ready in less than 15 minutes. It could be that we ordered items that weren't on the breakfast menu and maybe it was our own fault for not following what others on yelp recommended.  We ordered:  Fried chicken Brussels sprouts - Flavorless, but the batter was crunchy Pork Chops - Strange Batter that was Sweet and Salty?   Fried Chicken - Dry and overcooked with no flavor Fries - Fresh and Crispy  The portions were extremely generous, but it lacked flavor.  We didn't even finish half what we ordered despite how hungry we were after David Guetta :)",

We came in with a group of 12 on a Sunday And the wait was only 15 mins. Anywhere else on the strip would have been at lest an hour if not longer wait. I'd recommend this place but if you wanted a gourmet breakfast I'd say find somewhere else, if you want some decent southern food at a decent price then this is the place. I'm sure I'll be back and I recommend this place as good breakfast/hangover food.",

He kindly told her, I had asked for tobacco and she said- oh yeah, here you go.   She was kind-- just supppppper slow! Nothing kills a bomb breakfast-- more than a cold breakfast!   Not sure we will return. First time I came there was a hair in my food.. Manager came and comped us.. 2 strikes now though.",

    "text": "Went here a few nights ago. It wasn't busy, so we walked right in to the bar and were almost to the bar but an employee, the hostess, told us we had to wait in line. It wasnt clear that there was a line so we stood behind two other people.  They seemed kinda annoyed because they were waiting a long time. So the manager told them there weren't enough servers.  Well, when it was our turn to go in, some guy from the casino area just walked up to the hostess and asked if he could sit at the bar. And guess what...she took him right to the bar & sat him down before us even though we had asked to sit at the bar well before!!!! He didn't even have to wait in line!! Wtf!!!?!  So when she sat us down, at the bar mind you, we sat next to him. Karma.  Anyways, so we ordered food and I ordered a Bloody Mary with rum.  Food came out, kinda slow, but still no drink. Whatever's, maybe they were still making it...? As for food... I ordered the Mac n Cheese. It was sour tasting. Not good. I did not enjoy it.  My friend ordered the fried chicken.  It was not cooked thoroughly. The biscuit that was served with it was tasty!   So I never got my Bloody Mary, our server didn't even apologize for not making it or serving it! Funniest part of the night..the guy who got seated before us, got his food way late!! And he had only ordered a small salad! Ha! That made me laugh.  So, overall I didn't like the place. I think it's kinda new, but for a Vegas restaurant, standards are higher for service and food.  Next time I'm gonna stick with Planet Dailies. Can't go wrong with that place!!",

The bartender made me a delicious lemon drop martini!! That's who won me over here!  The atmosphere of this restaurant is modern up scale dinner like, they have straight bar you can sit and watch a game or chat with the bartenders or partying people at the bar.  We ordered the pretzel, it was decent and they baked it they way we requested it. I was a little disappointed with the beer cheese they served, it had a weak taste. The menu presented it more exotic like... another way they won me over is that they have local hot sauce on the tables next to Tabasco. Th  local hot sauce is called CHAMUCOS it has a nice taste, slight heat and love that it's non gmo. Way to represent a little health in sin city.",

I hate when restaurants throw this on the menu as if it's easy to make. This is a \"signature dish\", either make it well or not at all!  Stick with safer breakfast options that are hard to mess up.  Also, the tap water has a funny taste so order juice or bottled water. My guest enjoyed their item so I gave two stars.",

    "text": "Had a good, but certainly not close to great, lunch at Pantry on a Thursday afternoon.  We arrived at Pantry around 1:30.  It was decently busy, but we walked right out.  I can't recall the name of Mirage's previous 24 hour coffee shop, but the decor at Pantry is a significant upgrade.    Service was acceptable during our meal, but it certainly was not great.  We had to wait for water refills a couple of times and getting our check back once we had given her the room number took quite a while.  That being said, our server was very friendly and did get us extra condiments quickly.  To eat, I went with the cajun chicken sandwich and the table shared an order of mac and cheese.  The sandwich comes with grilled chicken, cheese, asparagus, some sort of green (maybe arugula?  Can't remember) and a spicy sauce on a ciabatta bun.  The bun was way too thick.  It was simply too much bread for the sandwich.  I had a couple of bites of the sandwich together and then gave up and ate the filling with a knife and fork.  The chicken was seasoned well but nothing about the dish was \"cajun.\"  It had no heat whatsoever.  The creamy avocado was nice with the chicken and the bacon was appropriately crispy.  The sauce was basically mayo.  The fries were standard wedge fries that you've probably had a lot of places.  I would not order this again, it's not that it was especially bad, but it was average to be sure.  Definitely 3 stars.  The mac and cheese was good, but not great.  I am guessing they use some sort of processed cheese to improve the creaminess of the dish.  A serving was enough for 2-3 people to share.  I would return to Pantry on future trips to Mirage, I think I probably should have ordered off of the all day breakfast list rather than lunch.",

    "text": "look in the PANTRY.  The Pantry is the 24 hour restaurant at the Mirage Resort and Casino.  On my most recent trip, my mom and I decided to eat breakfast at the Pantry purely out of convenience reasons (though this was not our first visit to this restaurant).  1.  Yes, its convenient.  They serve breakfast food all day, and other menu items include salads, sandwiches, large entrees, etc.  2.  Yes, they offer room service.  Even more convenience at your fingertips; well its convenient if you're a guest at the Mirage anyway.  3.  Yes, they're open 24 hours.  Have I yet to mention the convenience of the Pantry??!  4.  Yes, the prices are a bit high.  This is after all Vegas resort pricing.  5.  Yes, the lines can get long for breakfast and lunch (and possibly dinner).  The reason being that the Mirage doesn't have a food court like other resorts, and the only other lower ended dining options at the resort are CPK, Carnegie Deli, or a burger place.  Also, its situated near the guest elevators so this is probably more for the fact that its close by (and convenient) than the other aforementioned places.  6.  Yes, the staff is courteous and friendly.  But then, they want a good tip, so of course they are.  7.  Yes, the food portions are fairly decent.  Though there is a nice price, the food portions (for our breakfast orders) were very filling.  Not overly generous, but not wanting more than what you were given.  I had the eggs benedict, while my mom chose the corned beef hash.  We both liked our entrees, no complaints.  BOTTOM LINE: Convenient.  Open 24 hours.  Located near the guest elevators.  Good option for breakfast if staying at the Mirage.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of trying out The Pantry while staying at The Mirage for my birthday weekend trip. It's great to have a restaurant open 24 hours while staying at The Mirage. You can have food delivered to your room (it's charged to your room and comes out of your deposit + $4 delivery fee) or you can eat at the restaurant itself.  I had orderd to my room twice and ate at the restaurant once during my stay. I will start off with the delivery experience. Ordering the food was easy. You press the button on your room's phone for The Pantry Kitchen 24 hour delivery, place your order, and they come to your room in the quoted amount of time. Both times I was quoted between 35-45 minutes, and they came no later than that. Yay! The first time I ordered the blueberry pancakes, smash browns, and a glass of chandon sparkling. The blueberry pancakes were yummy, fluffy and was worth the price. The smash browns are chopped up potatoes, which was cooked to the right texture. It wasn't too mushy or too hard. The chandon came in a plastic cup with a lid (like for soda), you provide your own ice. The second time I ordered with delivery, I got the backyard burger, cinnamon sugar donut bites, and a sprite. The backyard burger was really good! The meat was cooked how I like it (well done). It was pretty big and filling for me on it's own. It comes with a side of french fries were nice and hot and crispy. The cinnamon sugar donut bites definitely satisfied my sweet tooth. I was expecting small round donut bites. I was pleasantly surprised to find they were round small donuts. I think there were 4-5 in the box (I lost count, they were so good! LOL). No complaints there.  Like I said above, I ate there once during my stay. I went down for breakfast around 8:30am. The line was already long. Since I had a small party, the hostess offered bar seating. I took that with no hesitation! I was helped right away.  Jose took my order. He was very attentive, fun to talk to, and refilled my coffee before even having to ask (that's a bonus!). I ordered the white chocolate brioche french toast, and an a side order of the smash browns (again, they're that good!). The french toast was sooooo good! There was a lot of jam on top, a good portion of french toast (saved some for later).  My only negative I have for The Pantry is the difference in menus between in room ordering and eating downstairs. When you order in room, you can only order from the menu that's provided IN THE ROOM! With that said, the room has a more condensed version on the restaurant menu (It's very limited). I was disappointed I couldn't even order hot chocolate (only on the restaurant menu downstairs). For the love of food and drink....what is that all about???",

Let me just get it out of the way and say, no, I didn't order pancakes, they did and loved them.  Inside of Pantry sounds just like the name suggests. It's kind of like Cracker Barrel's classy cousin that doesn't come around too much. The decor was a nice change from what you typically see in Vegas. Not so much of the glitz and glamor here, but more-so of a Kirklands and Town & Country vibe.  The service was great. We had a very helpful service, and she had an assistant who constantly made sure our glasses were full.  I ordered an omelet with bacon, tomato and cheese, side of potatoes and instead of bread, one of their cheddar and chive biscuits. If you do nothing else, get those biscuits. My oh my, delicious you guys. Warm and flaky with just the perfect amount of well, everything.  The omelet was great too. You know, it's an omelet so nothing out of this world, but still tasty as were the potatoes.  If I stayed closer to this location when I'm in Vegas I'd probably want to hit it up every day, especially being that it's open 24hours. That could be a bad thing for me.",

The horseradish mashed potatoes had a great kick, and the fried onions added such great texture. I will definitely be ordering that again. You can also order to your room!",

So.. in that case the price is considered normal.  My mom got the white chocolate french toast which was $15.00 and I got the chicken & waffles which was $18.00, my husband and I shared this and to be honest they gave us two big fried chicken so this dish is def shareable because the portions were huge. The french toast wasn't a big portion in fact my mom said it was too sweet.  Service was just okay, we went there around 10am and it was pretty busy. Also the place looked pretty clean as well!  This place is 24 hours so if you feel like having breakfast for dinner, you could do it!",

They had sausage links which were great and juicy and the pancakes were pure heaven on my plate. IN LOVE!  ***ONLY ISSUE- they should have a meal that includes pancakes, eggs and meat. I have to order everything separate and it's almost $20. I hate when places force you to spend a ridiculous amount of money when they can still charge a lot and give me what I want even if it's a dollar less than ordering ala carte.",

No one checked back to see if our table was ok so we had to flag people down. We had to flag someone down for the check and were charged incorrectly for food we did not order. Alex said he would adjust it.. He returned with a check that had not been corrected after telling us it was. As we sat there waiting to sign the check other tables were complaining loudly about the service as well...

My husband got an omelette that was basically a couple of folded over eggs with very skimpy fillings.   Look, I know this is Vegas and everything costs a premium. I have no problem paying higher prices to eat but I expect at least mediocre food for the price.   Skip this place and find somewhere else.",

Or better yet, just get room service! They can deliver right to your door. However, if you want the Cookie Skillet desert, you cannot get this to go!!! Apparently the skillet is too hot to put in a take-away container.  The salads are generously portioned - order a half order if you are wanting a salad for yourself. A full sized salad is great to share with 2 or 3 people. The omelette is quite tasty. The cookie skillet is good, but a little salty.  Yes, it is expensive, but everything in Vegas is expensive. Just forget about the price, order whatever you like (it will most likely be delicious) and win back your money at the slots next door.",

This review is all based of the actual sit down restaurant for breakfast.   Overall the first thing that stood out was the ambiance and decor. It was really nice a mixture of country contemporary and very clean. Drinks are served out of mason jars, milk is served in farm milk cans and the special are presented in a cast iron, super country cute!   Although there tends to be a wait, service was fast and friendly.   The reason why they don't get a full 5 is because the food is overall somewhat bland. Again, great presentation but it lacked some flavor.",

Then new management came and made it into BB King's then that concept didn't work out. So here comes the Pantry where they're open 24/7 which is very convenient right by the bank of elevators. When you're drunk and need to sober up, the Pantry is the perfect remedy to get rid of that hangover.   Service here was spot on! We were quickly greeted and seated right away. They have self seating in the bar in case you don't want to sit in a regular table. As with every other resort are the $$$ prices on the food. It doesn't matter to me because it's all part of the Vegas strip experience.   I ordered the spicy rub wings and flat bread. The wings were so good and flat bread was delicious even with their own brand of hot sauce. Our waiter would always check up on us to see if we wanted to order more cocktails. Even though it was pricey, I'd say it was worth it. I'll be making plans to dine at the pantry when we go back to the Mirage in August 2016. I love the Mirage!!",

Our food was really good and they served a decent amount. We weren't really happy about the fact that coffee was on the table with cream ready to pour all ready to go.. like it was free. The lady even started pouring without letting me know I'd be charged for it. The coffee was $5 a cup... a little overrated if you ask me. But overall food and service was good",

Ordered room service last night - I got the breakfast sandwich with the \"hash brown potatoes\" the potatoes were bland, and so was the sandwich - not nearly as good as the description.   We also got the fried chicken - it was dry.   Needless to say, I decided we will NEVER eat there again. So sad I cannot even get good room service food! What's the point of being open 24hrs if it's not even good food! :/   So disappointing. When I'm in Vegas I expect to have a good meal. So sad!",

The problem came when it was time to leave.  I have a vouches from MYVegas that gave us $15 off our meal.  The server wouldn't let us charge it to our room, because he claimed that was combining offers.  I have never heard of charging to your room as been a special offer from the hotel.  He then tried to tell me that it says right on the reward that you can't charge to your room.  I've read and reread the terms and conditions and there is no such wording.  Granted in the scheme of things $15 isn't a lot of money, but it is the point of this being the day of my wedding and now I have lost my reward coins, but now I am out $15.  If they don't want to participate they should take down the reward.  Has the MGM gone so crazy with nickel and diming their patrons that they now consider charging to your room to be a special privilege??",

We got an order of pancakes and some basic american breakfast items.  The pancakes were absolutely delicious, so light and perfectly cooked.  The other items were pretty basic and what you would expect from places like Ihop and Denny's only difference was may the portions were bigger.  The wait from order to your room was almost 50 minutes so that was a little disappointing but the condiments were great and was given everything we needed to eat.",

When The Pantry first opened it solved a huge need at the resort: Fresh, \"American Diner\" flair with generous portions, and relatively decent prices. It's been a success, with the lines routinely sneaking around the resort.   That said, since its opened you can tell there's a bit of corner cutting happening at the Pantry. It's menu has been pared down quite a bit, and the fresh jellies and jams (in their own mason jars) have been replaced by regular food service mini bottles. Service has taken a hit too in terms of wait times, but that sort of thing happens to be so random in Vegas, I never hold it against the restaurant.   Bottom line: The food is still good but the gradual decline in quality needs to be addressed.",

Over the course of three days I had the chicken and waffles and 2 egg breakfast.  I was really looking forward to Chicken and waffles but was disappointed with the flavor.   The portion was more than enough to take my hunger away but the chicken really didn't have a ton of flavor to it.  Again a little disappointed.  On the subsequent days, I had the 2 egg breakfast with sausage and potatoes.  I thought that this was much better than the chicken and waffles.  Eggs were done well and the sausage and potatoes had really good flavor.    Service was pretty consistent which was ok.  Nothing spectacular and in some cases you needed to flag them down.

I tend to get into Vegas in the middle of the night so I'm limited to whatever is open that late for a late night snack or a late night dinner. The few times I've come has always been for either my husband or my own birthday. So the few times I've been here, Nan has helped us out and has always been extremely helpful and always provides us with awesome service.   The food, lets be honest here...its pretty much comfort food. Great for any time of day. My kids have eaten here without any issues. Service weither its during the day or in the late hours of the evening...it has never disappointed me. Every staff member that has helped us before has always left me leaving delighted so this is like my go to spot when I get into town late or if my kids just want something simple on the strip. It's better then having chained fast food that's opened 24 hours and better then chained restaurants that are also opened 24 hours.  Yelp 2017 Review Challenge 92/100",

    "text": "Horrible experience. H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E. My sister and I came here the first night of our stay to grab a bite before going to bed. We were seated and the busperson came to collect our drink orders -- a water and a club soda. The water comes along with the menus then the waitress comes almost immediately to collect our orders. Of course we aren't ready because we just received menus so ask for a couple of minutes. Then we wait. And wait. The club soda comes (it only took 15 minutes to make). Then we wait. And wait. I flag down the waitress from across the restaurant. She motions that she's coming in a minute. Mind you, the restaurant is only 1/3 full and most of the tables already had food when we arrived. Furthermore, the waitress only had 3 other tables aside from ours, of which 2 had already eaten. But she was frazzled so couldn't take our order. And every other employee disappeared from the floor so we couldn't even ask someone else about our waitress's whereabouts. So we wait. And wait. And wait. Finally the busperson comes out so we ask her to please find our waitress so we can order. She says, \"Ok,\" but then keeps clearing tables. So we wait. And wait. And wait. The busperson sees we are irritable so eventually goes to the waitress to let her know we're waiting. At this point, it has been 10-15 minutes since we asked the busperson to get the waitress and about 45 minutes total since we've been waiting. (As an aside, if it had not been 12:30am and other places were open, we never would have waited that long to begin.) So she comes and we order the 'Wings 2 Ways' and regular fries. That's it. Just wings and fries. Then someone walks in and flags her down and she starts taking his order at the door before he's ever seated by the hostess. Five minutes pass before she goes to put in the order. After another 15 minutes the FOH manager brings out the wings and asks if we need \"more plates\". Sir, we never received plates to begin with. So he tells the waitress and she drops them on our table without a word and hurries away. Okay. So we don't have the fries but maybe they're coming. So we wait. And wait. And wait some more. We ask the busperson to get the manager. She says okay then goes to clean tables. After about 7 minutes our waitress comes out the back and the busperson tells us we want a manager. So the waitress comes to ask if we need anything else -- yes, a manager (and the fries you never brought but that's a dead issue at this point). She says, \"Ok,\"...but then walks off to start checking her tables on the computer. Then she starts talking to another customer...then she starts talking to coworkers. So my sister gets up to go ask the bartender if he can get a manager. He says okay then turns back to cleaning. We ended up having to wait for the manager to come out to talk to someone else before we could flag him down to make a complaint. He gave us the meal on the house which was fine because the wings were nasty (the chipotle lime tasted like ketchup and the dry spiced tasted like Lay's bbq chips) and the fries that they eventually brought out in a to-go container were old and had obviously been sitting somewhere for awhile. She came to apologize and said there was a glitch in the computer that didn't send the fry order to the kitchen. I don't know whether that's True nor do I care. The service throughout the restaurant was some of the worst I've ever encountered. I can't speak for the whole menu but what I ordered was not at all tasty. But the decor was nice and it was clean so I'll give them one star for that. Don't come here unless you are too drunk to care about receiving quality service and decent food.",

Tells me that they need more staff or better waiters. Then it took forever to get our food, which tells me the kitchen staff needs the guy from nighmare kitchens to organize them.  By the time we got our food we had to scarf it down or be late for our show.( my bad for thinking 75 minutes would be plenty of time // food was pretty good but couldn't enjoy it )  We tried to pay or check, but no cashier in the front!!(should of just walked-out)... only 1 hostess who was busy trying to organize what seemed like a flash mob of a line. They must not want customers, plp were just walking away after learning about the wait time. She was helpful by finding our slug of a waiter to ring up our check. The whole time we were there, no manager in sight. They must hide in the back and do nothing but collect a paycheck.",

    "text": "Stopped there twice over a period of 2 days mainly due to convenience as I was attending a conference at the Mirage. First day, ordered eggs and asked for fries instead of hash browns. Food turned up twenty minutes later with hash browns. Mentioned to the server that I had asked for french fries and was told that they would bring me an order of fries. Twenty five minutes later, no sign of the fries but the server did explain that as this is a new restaurant, the kitchen does not like substitutions and tends to just send out whatever is on the menu. Cancelled the fries, paid and left. Following day, stopped in for lunch. Ordered a bacon cheese burger, plain with fries. Order was taken by the same server as the previous day who recognized me and assured me it would be right this time. Twenty minutes later, out comes my burger with everything on it (apart from the bacon). Sent the whole meal back this time and five minutes later it was returned and everything looked ok although they had obviously just scraped everything off. Took a bite, not ok. They had melted the cheese on the burger over a liberal helping of onions which I had not noticed and that also do not agree with me at all. Called my server who offered another burger and waived the charges for the original one when I refused. Bottom line, if you do not want the meal EXACTLY as it is described on the menu, find somewhere else.",

First they give me a teapot which turned out to be just hot water, which I thought it happens people often forget the tea bag. We waited about 30 minutes for our food to come out, oh wait I mean for my dish and my sons. My husbands dish actually didn't make it to our table until 15 minutes later.  They have fruit loops on the menu but the waitress didn't tell us that they were out we found out when the server brought a different type of cereal, we of course sent it back for something our son would eat. Maybe I'm being difficult but I thought when a restaurant runs out of something they 1) notify the customer and 2) tells them what the options are?! The worst part was that my son and and got our food and my husbands dish never appeared, we had to ask the hostess to get the manager, since our waitress was no where to be found, and the manager, who was apologetic (reason for 2 stars) went to the kitchen and brought his dish, keep in mind the dish made it to our table when me and my son were both done with our food, and those of you who have been around a five year old know how restless kids get. Needless to say we will never be back.",

I ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad with grilled chicken and it saved this place from instant immolation. The greens and tomatoes were fresh, the mozzarella creamy, the dressing perfectly flavored, and the chicken tender and tasty. If you're willing to wait forever and ever for your food, stop in.

We immediately were attended to and gave our drink order. Service was friendly and attentive, and surprisingly even though the place was packed we did not wait long for our order to be taken or the food to come to the table.

    "text": "Unimpressed is the first reaction. I heard this place had good food. Well, it made me sick. It was the room temperature coleslaw served with the BBQ ribs, avoid this dish.   I lined up in the MLife line. The front desk lady took another party ahead of everyone else in line without explanation, not good. Later, the manager explained that there were executives attending a brunch. Be careful of the greeter, they don't always pay attention to customers in line. A manager tried to address the issue but just gave us excuses and fluff about how the special party had reservations and the rest of the group was already seated in the back. That's all well and fine, just don't leave the public with the impression that they are less significant than the salaried executives.    We tried the white chocolate brioche for an appetizer, truffle oil mac and cheese, BBQ ribs, and homemade potato chips with mushroom dip. The BBQ sauce was too sweet, too tomato pasty, and did not compliment the meat. The luke-warm cole slaw is sour and doesn't taste fresh. The biscuits are without flavor. Potato chips and dip are reasonably good but lack any inspiration to finish.   Anything claiming to be truffle is actually just truffle oil laden. For real truffles, you have to pay more but True artisan culinary delights made with truffles but it's worth it and better than the oil sprinkled mac and mushroom dip. It's only ok but not great.   This little eatery is trying too hard to be like the Yardbird at the Venetian Casino. But instead of eating here, eat at the Yardbird where the trip and cost are so worth it. Save your tummy and trip and pass on the Pantry.",

    "text": "Great little eclectic diner in The Mirage! I'm not a big fan of most diner food- it's usually generic or heavy on the grease. However, Pantry provides a big enough twist with semi-healthy (and fresh!) options to keep me wanting to come back for more.  The atmosphere of Pantry is best described as a down home bakery, with black and white accents and funky accessories dotting the walls. My husband immediately noticed how quirky and inviting it looked as we walked by, asking if we could stop in for lunch. Not so set on diner food yet noticing this one's unique appeal, I reluctantly agreed.    I ordered the turkey club sandwich.  Being someone that doesn't eat red meat, my options were limited on their menu.  Honestly I was afraid I was going to get boring Oscar Meyer turkey on a stale roll and was already preparing to make this my first and last visit.  The inclusion of turkey bacon and avocado on the sandwich had me hoping I might be wrong, but I didn't hold my breath. Luckily when the food arrived I was pleasantly surprised. My roll was soft and fresh, the turkey thinly sliced and of high quality, with thick avocado and lettuce piled high on top. A pickle, pickled vegetables and metal container of french fries rounded out my plate. The presentation was spot on and the taste was pretty much on par with how it looked. No, this wasn't the best food I had ever had, but it was pretty damn good for a diner in The Mirage!  My husband's spinach feta omelet with roasted tomatoes looked pretty tasty as well. It was cooked to perfection with a side of arugula and whole wheat toast. Fresh jam was also available on the table. Upon finishing his plate, he told me this might be the best breakfast he's had in Vegas thus far (and we usually go twice a year). Upon looking at the hotel's magazine later, Pantry also offers Valrhona \"Grand Cru\" milk chocolate pancakes. Chunks of chocolate piled atop freshly made pancakes? Yes Please!  I know we'll be back.",

    "text": "This review is based on my latest and probably last meal at this establishment. From beginning to end it was handled very poorly by the staff and management. It was a number of mistakes that were made that grabbed my attention.   Our appetizers came out about 30 seconds before our main course came out. There was a mistake with my order and was sent back to the kitchen to be replaced with the correct order. By the time my food returned, our party had finished their food and was ready to leave. My food was brought to the table by the chef, which was a nice gesture. Both the chef and waitress came to the table, they just put the food on the table and walked away, not a word from either of them.  Also, when my food arrived, there was another mistake, my sandwich was not cut and the knives on the table weren't sharp enough for me to cut it myself.   The level of unprofessional behavior from the staff at the restaurant was not what I would expect at any establishment, much less at a hotel like the Mirage. There was one employee who was very friendly and helpful, it was a man who was clearing the tables.   I wish the manager had come by our table so that I could speak to him/her about the situation and have a positive resolution, but we never saw the manager. Might as well have had a chimpanzee in a suit with a manager tag on his chest. It's a shame, because I was looking forward to returning in the morning for some pancakes, but that won't be happening anytime soon.",

Pantry serves breakfast 24 hrs a day. - You probably smell pretty bad from drinking, smoking, and dancing all night. Grab a bite to eat before you head up to hit the shower, your hangover will thank you. - Super fast friendly service and they won't even make fun of the fact that you cheaped out and got a $20 hooker, instead of a $100 hooker. Hey at least you're nice enough to buy her some pancakes.  - Prices are moderately expensive, but it is Las Vegas the only thing cheap are the hookers. - Interestingly enough they have healthy organic options...in case you've endulged so much you need to offset your behavior. - You can gamble close by while you wait for a seat. - The decor is very white, French country kitchen style. Nice and keeps you awake night or day.  I had a nice breakfast here before heading out of town last time in Vegas.  Casinos were good to us, and Vegas paid for it...so awesome.  ENJOY people, and wrap it up buttercup!",

    "text": "We stayed at the Mirage last week while in Vegas, and this restaurant is located right next to the bank of elevators that go to the rooms so it was hard to miss. The first night we got in I was starving after a long plane ride and bad airport snacks, so we decided to get in line for a table. On a whim we asked if the bar was first come first serve and found out it was, so we ditched the line to eat there instead without a wait.  A bartender brought waters fairly quickly while we browsed the menu. I'm always a sucker for places that serve all day breakfast, but Big T's Grilled Cheese was calling my name. Much like pizza, I rarely meet a sandwich with melted cheese I don't like.   They served it with piping hot potato wedges, ketchup, a pickle, and pickled green beans. I'm not normally a green bean person but these were awesome. They had that spicy/sweet thing going on and added a much needed bite of freshness to such an indulgent plate (not that I was complaining).   My friend ordered the Backyard Burger which also came with pickled green beans, a pickle, and potato wedges. On it was caramelized onions, tomatoes, greens, cheddar (that she left off), and a potato bun. She mixed some of the tableside hot sauce into her ketchup and said it made it even better. It was the perfect late night greasy meal.  I wanted to try their coffee and pancakes before leaving (that I heard were great), but we never got back around to it. I would definitely stay at the Mirage again however, so will make my return visit then. It's also convenient that you have the option to charge your bill to your room as well.",

I highly recommend getting one plate and sharing with everyone because it can get a little tiring eating all that in one sitting, the portion is also pretty big. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos and they were okay. My tacos were pretty dry in my opinion, but I drenched them in limes and hot sauce which satisfied me just enough. I also ordered a side of potato wedges and they were my favorite!!! Definitely get the fries if you're a die hard potato fan. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and had so much flavor without being too salty. Also, presentation was very nice and picture perfect if you're a insta foodie this is perfect for that new post ;). Overall, I would suggest stopping by if you're nearby!",

    "text": "In terms of enjoying All American comfort food, I'd gladly give 'The Pantry\" a respectable 4 stars.  The flavors in every dish and dessert are spot-on, well balanced and filling without feeling heavy.  Now, let's talk about the service:  I really wanted to come here for my birthday breakfast and despite the usually long wait in line.  We were happy to hear that the wait was \"only 15 minutes\".  We did find it weird that literally every group in front or behind us we're being told the same amount of time, regardless of party size.  We figured maybe the tables are turned fairly quickly, so thought little of it.  Turns out that a couple of the \"solo\" people in line were placeholders for large parties; two of which were parties of 10!  So our \"15 minute wait\" became 40.  We finally make it to the front of the line when the hostess comes up looking for the party of 2 (being us).  She literally stands in front of us, looks right past us and calls on the family behind us; a group of clearly at least 5 people and all Caucasian.  The father of that group looked right at the hostess and told her: \"I'm pretty sure these guys are before us.\" She only rolled her eyes and gave some half-hearted, BS excuse as to why she chose to ignore the gay couple of color.  We thanked the gentleman behind us and walked into the dining room where the hostess was already waiting (clearly impatient and irritated) at our table.  Would've been nicer if she actually LED us to our table rather than force us to find her, but at that point we already wrote off her inability to provide even a passing semblance of customer service.  The food service itself was ok.  Wasn't bad but certainly wasn't good. Truthfully, we didn't expect expedient service given the location and venue, but as our experience had started on the most SOUR note, we lost our appetite abd finished less than half our meal.  We were in and out of there so fast because honestly, we didn't feel welcome.  I would say we hadn't even been sitting for the 15 minutes we were quoted at the outset.  The best part of our experience was getting our bill almost instantly as we wanted to get the hell out of there.  We charged it to our room at the Mirage and left.  We did make an attempt to say something to the Front of House Manager but she was barely phased by the event and offered the most disingenuous apology I've heard in quite some time.  Last time we'll come here.  It's a shame really. Their bread pudding is phenomenal but not worth the price of being disrespected.  I really should've just gone to the Carnegie Deli instead.  The food tastes better, wait is minimal and our meal doesn't come with a side of bigotry.",

We were seated promptly and our waiter greeted us almost immediately.  Overall, we had a quite pleasant experience here. The service was very attentive but not intrusive. My husband takes FOREVER to decide what he wants sometimes, and our server was so patient and was willing to put our son's order in first while my husband decided. I tried the Green Eggs and Ham.  It was delicious.  The english muffin was one of the best I have had.  Obviously fresh baked.  I asked our server if they baked then in house.  He said no but wasn't sure if they were made in the hotel or not.  Still, it was tender and yummy. The potato smash was slightly cold. My husband had the brisket cheese steak on baguette instead of ciabatta.  He seemed to like it.  It was pretty big, too.  This is a fairly new place and it seems like they may have had some transitional issues by the other reviews.  Our experience was very good and I would come here again.  My only complaints are that the closest bathroom is quite a long way from the restaurant and also that the prices are a little steep- i've noticed that most establishments in the Mirage are overpriced, though.",

This place has decent pancakes, but we've had better.  The butter we were served was actually a waxy/lard like margarine.  Soooo disgusting. The pancakes would have been much better with real butter.  I ordered the cheddar chive biscuits with scrambled eggs and country gravy.  I can tell you the country gravy is good.   Our server was very businesslike taking our order. We never saw him after he left the table. A nice lady brought the food to our table. We never saw her again. Not sure what was going on, but this might explain why we were never offered refills on our drinks.  We had to flag down a busboy for refills and our check.  Won't be going back.

He said the soup tasted like it had sugar and flowers in it. I tried it, and thought there may be some sort of fruit in it. The restaurant itself is gorgeous. The desserts that other people ordered looked amazing. I hope they take some of these comments to heart and improve.",

The english muffin wasn't an english muffin.  It looked and weighed more like a hockey puck. They only provide coffee in a half gallon box, so that was $15 wasted just for a single cup.  For $38 plus tip, I should have gone to the buffet in my pajamas ....twice.  There was a time when hotels cared about quality, particularly in this town.  I guess now its only about profit.",

    "text": "Stayed at the Mirage for a conference where I walked around all day long...  I was craving some kind of fried chicken and did not feel like walking more than I needed to.  Pantry was the most convenient so I decided to check it out.  I got seated at the bar and the bartender quickly made me feel comfortable and took my order.  I got the Texas Pete Fried Chicken with a mix of white and dark meat.  The portion was pretty decent with a generous share of gravy, a decent mash potato, and a pretty good biscuit.  This dish satisfied my craving for fried chicken.  The bartenders and other staff were quite friendly that I decided to return the next day before leaving Vegas.  I got the shrimp penne.  It was a little on the greasy side but I really liked the fact that they de-tailed the shrimp (sometimes things are in the details)!  The bartenders were personable and made my solo dining fun.  Thanks guys!  If I ever stay at the Mirage again I'll probably swing by here for a meal or two.",

Happy hour runs from 3-6 pm and 11pm-2am daily. Much to my delight they serve Coke here. (That is the reason they get an extra star.) We ordered the caprese flatbread ($5), the chicken wings with the dry rub($5), and the pretzel with the cheese dip($5). All were specially priced for happy hour. The flatbread was gross. It had no flavor and was dry. We each ate one piece and left the rest. The wings were ok. My friend liked them better then I did I think. I thought the seasoning was just thrown on top on them. There was some \"ranch\" that was served with them, but they were better without it I guess. They were also served with some carrots and celery, but they looked so dried out and gross we thought they might have just been for decoration. The pretzel was just ok. It was just a filler. The service was friendly. Our server even offered to make me a Coke to go! That is the only reason I am giving two stars. Otherwise, I would not recommend this place for the happy hour food at all!! Run! There are too many other places to eat in Vegas that are much better. I hope.",

The reason our experience was so bad though was the server we had. This was Thursday morning, Sept 13. She took the order of the people who sat after us first, took awhile to get to us, and when our food came out, another server ran it out to us. Not even 5 minutes into eating she dropped the bill on our table and said \"I'm getting off, I need you to pay this now\". So we continued to eat, I finished, but then she came over and asked \"are you guys done?\", my boyfriend said no and she still cleared his plate even though he wasn't finished eating. Seems like she just really wanted to shove us out the restaurant. As a bartender and restaurant supervisor myself, this experience really makes me cringe, I didn't get her name (though if she does this frequently I imagine her employer knows who I'm talking about) but I would never allow a server that disrespectful to work under me in a restaurant.",

Brightens each bite.   My husband ordered the chicken and waffles, it was okay. The waffle was flimsy, not crispy. I know this sounds particular but when you're having it with chicken and pouring syrup all over, you want that waffle to be exceptional to hold up. It also didn't have much flavor. It just tasted like oil.   It was a breakfast that satisfied our hunger and we are glad we tried it! But nothing that wowed us.",

    "text": "#57  for 2018  Serving breakfast up 24/7 was perfect for us after sleeping in from a busy weekend.  We got there about 12:30pm on a Monday to a room easy to get a table for 7.  Our drink order was taken after we had time to peruse the menu but not yet ready to order.  The orange juice came in small glasses.  Fresh squeezed of course but still felt over priced.  Soup of the day was French Onion Soup.  Delicious.  And not salty either.  Wanted to get another but I ordered enough.  I had the Chef's Omelette with your choice of 3 items from the pantry.  I went with the classic ham, sausage and cheese.  This came in a tight roll.  Must've been 3 small eggs too because it looked like a 2 egg omelette.  It was good but no wow factor there.  The traditional eggs bendict was good.  I do like the slight lemony taste in the hollendaise sauce.  This had none.  Add hot sauce to this made it all right.  Poured hot sauce over the country  fried potatoes  to take it up a notch.  The spaghetti with large meatballs... now that was good.  Lots of flavors and a good amount for the price.    Surprisingly the corn beef hash was not salty.  This was really good too.  Served in the skillet with country potatoes and toast was a filling dish.    Large blueberries were used in the pancakes.  Three large pancakes had some cooked inside.  That made it sweet enough as they popped from the heat spreading their juices.  I did add a little syrup for flavor.  Of course.    Service was friendly but not attentive enough.  It wasn't that busy but it took awhile to get refills and a few other items needed.  With our good friends and family all that didn't matter.  We enjoyed ourselves.",

The food portions were generous and it all tasted delicious. I had a small house salad which was actually quite large and had cubes of feta cheese. It was amazing. The pulled pork sliders have generous amounts of pork and they come with fries and coleslaw. Another at my table ordered a clubhouse which was huge and fresh. The server topped up our water several times. I ordered a white sangria and I think it was straight vodka with some pieces of fruit in it - pretty sure they forgot to add the Prosecco and the peach schnapps lol. Other than the drink which I couldn't finish, this place did not disappoint. The restaurant was full by 6pm.",

They have a variety of gluten free and vegetarian options, and while meals vary from $8-$23 you can easily split almost any meal...portions are that generous. If you're looking for a great value and fantastic service, definitely come during happy hour which is 3-6 pm and 11 pm to 2 am. If you come during the morning/afternoon be prepared to pay more and have less personal service.  Everything on the menu is delicious food wise. The only tip I have is to avoid asking for espresso beverages. They don't know how to make a latte or cappuccino but their coffee is decent and comes with free refills.  If you're looking for great food in a convenient location, this is your spot!",

There is always a long line to get in but it usually moves really fast. The service is impeccable. Everyone is always smiling and cheerful so if I don't return for the food, I will definitely return for that.  The prices are usual Vegas prices! Inflated and high for no good reason lol. The portion sizes are a bit on the small side.  The food leaves much to be desired though. We had eggs which was really greasy. The blueberry pancakes was okay. Nothing to rave about and the coffee was average. Will I return to get breakfast here? Maybe !!   I recommend you try at least once though!",

The cream sauce was too thick and it wasnt all that hot. The shrimp was overcooked and tough and I ended up not even eating all five shrimp on the dish. For dessert we got the apple pie with vanilla ice cream - now THAT was good stuff! Absolutely delicious!   Decor is nice - it feels like you are in an offshoot of Martha Stewart's kitchen or something, and I mean that in a good way! Very crisp and clean in appearence. The booths are a little weird - the tables are too high fkr the booth seats so I felt like I could barely reach my food and my 6 foot something friend felt the same!",

Service is mixed - very friendly and efficient from ordering to delivering the food, but then seemed to disappear once we were ready for the check. Be prepared to wait in line during peak hours.  I liked that the menu listed the items that could be made gluten free or vegetarian - it made for easier ordering and less chance of cross-contamination. I opted for the garden vegetable hash, which comes with nut-free basil pesto and poached eggs (no smash browns or toast) and a plethora of veggies. Portions are on the large side, so you won't leave hungry. The food was fairly tasty, but my poached eggs were overcooked, almost hard-boiled. Since we were short on time, I didn't bother to send it back, but I did miss the way the yolk should have run into the hash.  Coffee was excellent, and so was the fresh-squeezed orange juice.",

After being seated quickly at a table, we waited 10 minutes before I had to flag down what looked like a manager. I politely told her how long we had been waiting and that no one had acknowledged us and she left to take care of it. She came back with a story about how the waiter who should have been servicing us was serving a large group at another table. Ok... so when does that mean you ignore other tables in your section? She proceeded to take our order. Later, she came back and admitted it had been a misunderstanding and a woman who was serving the tables directly behind us was our waitress. Lots of excuses.    Coffee was good and served in a pot on your table. My husband and I shared the bakery 3 for $10 deal with 2 bagels and mini donuts, plus a side of bacon. The waitress who ultimately took care of us was very nice, just wish it hadn't taken so long to be acknowledged. Not to mention, those items came out to be $28! Everything is expensive on the strip.  Interestingly enough, the man seated at the table next to us who also was being ignored told us he had eaten there before and the service was very poor/slow.   Maybe it'd be better at a different time of day, but I'd say take a walk to the Pool Cafe at the Mirage --better service and better atmosphere!",

Janel was extremely nice and helpful with our selections. Her service was better than the 5 star restaurants we visited the previous three nights and as busy as she was, she made us feel as though we were her only customers. Thank you Janel for outstanding service, great food and a pleasant late night breakfast. You're the best! Jim B",

Full meals for $18-20 while surrounding restaurants charge $35 and up.  Menu has every single item on it feels like. Perfect place if you're here for business.  Plus it's open 24/7.  Needs to be more marketed as it's kind of hidden. And the word \"kitchen\" should be taken out of the name and changed to \"boutique restaurant\", will make the restaurant appealing to larger crowds and that's what it is anyway",

    "text": "So we have tickets to see a  7:00 Pm show at the Mirage. I have been to the Original Pantry in Los Angeles, which is very good. So I thought I would try the Las Vegas one, which is located inside the Mirage. It was Tuesday night and it was busy, but not slammed. The menu looked good. I decided on the smothered breakfast burrito (you can get breakfast all day, but it was dinner time) My other half ordered caesar salad, add chicken (a half order because waitress said it was big) It took a long time to get the food out of the kitchen. When it finally arrived I looked at my burrito, which was the size of a large egg roll. I kid you not, and the price was 18.00. I wish I took a picture. My partners salad was the size of a dinner salad. So for 50 plus dollars, we got the above, and they messed up our tab, so somebody else paid for our iced tea. The staff was nice, its just the food was way overpriced for what we got and it wasn't even good food. I could have gone to Circle K or 7/11 and got better food. I will never go back there. I know food is high in Las Vegas, but this was beyond high for what we got.  Good luck, hope this helps.",

    "text": "I'm walking through the hotel and I had to start planning out my meals. As much as I'd love to go out and enjoy a Michelin Star restaurant, I frankly didn't have the luxury of time this time while attending the medical conference. Luckily, the Mirage was chockers full of places to eat that were quick but good. I think one place that people pass over without thinking about it much is the Pantry. This is the hotel's restaurant and the one that then goes on to give you room service. They are open 24 hours and breakfast is available all day. That's right I said it. All day breakfast people.  Generally there isn't much of a wait. In fact, if you want to sit at the bar, there is no wait at all and you have access to the full menu. Being on one of my low carb diets it was challenging to say the least not because there was no protein but because of how amazing the carbs were on the menu! But I managed with a chicken fried steak (awesome by the way and delicious... but skipped the potatoes) and chicken wings. What a combo but the chicken wings are awesome (but so are the ones across the way at the Still.  I also had one meal there where I had the Caesar salad with chicken. Chicken was dry so I would go with shrimp the next time. Service was quick and fantastic. They were all so friendly and really let you do your thing rather than try to chime in on personal conversations (it's the worst sometimes!).  So if you're looking for a place to chill and it's 3 AM, you're in luck. The Pantry is the place to be.",

Every time we walked by we saw a line waiting for Pantry and now I see why.  I ordered the french toast and would order it again and again in a heartbeat!  It was topped with a mascarpone topping and berries with a side of butter and syrup.  I cleaned my plate and was definitely overstuffed!  Another wonderful thing was that I ordered coffee and they brought me a steaming mug full and a whole coffee pot.  One of my biggest pet peeves is ordering coffee and having to wait for the server to decide I am ready for more.  With my own pot at the table I could warm up my cup or fill it up whenever I wanted (which is a lot!).  My only warning for you is know what you are ordering.  The waitress almost \"tricked\" me into ordering $7 bacon onto the side of my french toast.  After ordering my french toast she asked, \"Would you like bacon or sausage with that?\"  Obviously the answer to that question is always \"Yes, I would love some bacon!\"  Luckily, I realized that the bacon was not included with my french toast plate before she walked away and could mark that off my order.  I am sure a lot of people make the same mistake when ordering.",

The huevos rancheros were good but the eggs benny and blueberry pancakes were just ok.  Also if you sit at the countertop be prepared for the onslaught of interruptions by at least 3 bartenders.  Ugh we were asked if we wanted our coffee refilled at least 10 times, no exaggeration!  Also this place is pricey for brunch we spent $60 and that's without cocktails. Our second experience was much better, after a night of dancing we decided to order room service at 2am.  We shared the grilled cheese and fries.  We were told delivery would be 30 mins or less and it was more like 10 mins tops.  The grilled cheese was buttery and had swiss and cheddar.  The fries were steak cut ones and seasoned great.  This hit the spot.   Next time I will stick to room service!",

In the midst of Las Vegas, it genuinely feels like you've been transported back to a diner from your childhood.  THE FOOD IS DELECTABLE HERE! It's not just a gimmicky themed restaurant.  I had the eggs benedict (which is my absolute fave breakfast food) and they did not disappoint!  The English muffin was perfectly toasted and the eggs were poached just right.  Also, the smashed browns were extremely flavorful!  My friend had the Boston Cream Pie pancakes, which I believe is one of their specialty pancakes that alternates everyday!  Whoever hired these servers should win an award because they literally remind me of the servers in some of the diners in my hometown (which I know, is kind of the idea).  The servers are all very sweet, and even their uniforms are on point!  The servers are even a bit quirky, so they have some character as compared to the formal and eloquent servers you're used to on the Strip.  I also think it was cute how they served water/beverages in mason jars!  A nice touch that they implemented recently is selling homemade desserts and jam!  I cannot wait to dine here again!",

We both had the egg white omelet (which must have been cooked with at least six eggs) that was completely loaded with our choice of three ingredients. We both went with spinach, mushrooms and feta. Smash Browns were better than most hash browns I've ever had, and the Texas style toast was served with delicious homemade jellies---apricot and strawberry. Please consider a stop to The Pantry...we'll likely return before we head back to PA in a few days!",

The vegetables were wonderful, again by themself. The young potatoes left me wishing that I had asked for substituting for rice or anything else. The salad, just a pile of arugula, was served on the dinner plate, again disjointed and that may be that I asked for dressing on the side so it wouldn't be over dressed. When the salmon was out of the way I mixed the arugula with the leftover vegetables--much better. Affordable, filling meal, just could've been so much better!",

    "text": "I am a Vegas local, and if you look at my reviews, I am very fair and don't give many bad reviews, but Pantry was just plain bad. The concept, design and table wares are fantastic. It is too bad that the staff, service and food don't follow suit.  It started Monday evening waiting on friends who I was meeting to see Beatles Love. We sat at the bar and I could tell almost immediately that things weren't going to go well. The bartender was going off about something with two guests sitting at the bar. When I ordered a martini, he very sarcastically stated, \"Well I hope you like that on the rocks - we don't have martini glasses here.\" Oh well, a vodka tonic for me then.  I started with Calamari -- extremely \"rubbery\" for calamari with very soggy breading. They serve their calamari with a mayo based dip which I didn't care for, but that is just my personal taste. The soggy, rubbery calamari -- no thanks.  When my friends arrived, they literally waited five minutes before being acknowledged by the bartender. Apparently the manager saw that he was struggling and came behind the bar and we were so relived, thinking he was there to help. I was dumbfounded when we asked for drinks and his response was, \"The bartender is backed up -- he'll be caught up soon.\" What decent manager doesn't jump in and help!!! One of my friends asked for lemonade and you'd have thought he asked for bubbling jet fuel. The bartender acted completely put out and it was a real effort for him to find the lemonade.  The loaded waffle fries my friends had were actually decent, but the terrible service and my bad calamari were signs that we won't be back. Pantry has a long way to go, and it is a shame because the concept is a great one.",

I am a sucker for breakfast, so I was super stoked to find out that it's served 24 hours. Our service wasn't the best. Our waitress was a bit impatient but still very sweet. I ordered the white chocolate brioche French toast, and it definitely lived up to the hype. My boyfriend ordered a side of fruit with his meal, but never received it. That was kind of a bummer, but they didn't charge us for it. I guess she just missed that when he ordered it or wasn't really paying attention lol. Regardless, I would definitely recommend this place to a friend. As a local, I'm coming back for more very soon!",

As a starter I ordered the pretzel with cheese sauce. Now I've been to Germany where their staple for bread is the soft pretzel.  This pretzel closely matches the perfect consistency of the ones in Germany.  I consider myself more of a waffle person, however for some reason my attention was drawn to the blueberry pancakes.  OMG, these are by far the best pancakes I've ever tasted.  I know what you're thinking (after partying all night in Vegas anything will taste good), but the True test was later that day when I was craving a snack and I ate my leftovers.  They were still amazing.  So when  that late night/ early morning craving happens, head to the Pantry.",

It took about 20 minutes or so for the food.  The restaurant is located feet from the hotel elevators so I expected hot, fresh food when I got to my room.  I was really disappointed though.  The French fries were soggy and lukewarm.  The fish should have had a crunchy batter but was soggy, just like the fries.  It was fairly hot but not that tasty.  For $20 plus tax and tip I really expected more than one soggy piece of fish.  I think that my food probably sat in the kitchen for a while before it was delivered to me.  There is no way that the piece of fish had just came out of a fryer.  If I ever go back I would stick with breakfast.  I can't really speak to the service.

The place was pretty full and two parties of four in front of us in line. However, we only waited for about 2 minutes and the hostess offered us two seats at the bar. We said sure and were sat in front of a very quaint and clean subway tiled bar.  We were immediately acknowledged by the bartender, Edgar. He asked what we would like to drink- I ordered a Mimosa and my mom was still looking over the beverage menu. Edgar asked if she wanted Tequila (my mom is 76 years old!) and my mom said sure!   LOL She actually ordered the coffee and we took our time to look over the food menu. They had a great breakfast selection and the food making it's way past us had great presentation and looked so fresh!  I decided upon the egg white omelet and added swiss cheese, spinach and mushrooms. Mom ordered the all-American breakfast with eggs scrambled, bacon crisp and dry whole wheat toast. It did not take very long for our breakfast at all, about 12 minutes and it was FABULOUS! My omelet was perfectly cooked and the smashbrowns were addicting!  I wanted to eat them all but they provide a good size portion and I was full after a few bites. My mom was very happy with her breakfast as well- everything came out as she had requested.  Edgar and the other guy behind the bar, Eren, kept our water and coffee filled and made pleasant conversation with us during out meal. I would definitely recommend this place- food and service were great!!!",

Fresh ingredients, unique spins on traditional favorites, and extremely friendly service helps make Pantry a welcome addition to The Mirage Resort and Casino.   I have been here 4 different times and have had equally enjoyable experiences each time, but my visit on 01/18/2016 was by far the most enjoyable. Jonel was our waitress, and she truly went above and beyond to make our dining experience extra special. She was full of helpful suggestions and always made sure the coffee was hot and the creme was cold. We ordered the Bavarian pretzel and the loaded waffle fries from the appetizer section. The pretzel was warm and soft on the inside with a nice crispy outside, and was flavorful even without the usual pretzel salt (it didn't need it). It came with a side of deli mustard and a beer cheese sauce for dipping. The sauce was just okay, the cheese was a bit gritty, but the pretzel was good enough to have on its own.  The waffle fries were crispy and nicely seasoned, and came loaded with melted cheese, bacon, chopped tomato, sour cream, and green onion. I would recommend these fries for sure! The portion is also a good size and surprisingly filling. We also split dessert--the mini donuts and the chocolately chocolate skillet cookie. The donuts were delicious! They came out warm and covered in sugar! The cookie was a little disappointing. The chocolate was too intense and a little bitter, which gave it a weird flavor overall. We told Jonel about it, and she was more than happy to replace it with something else. We chose the bananas foster Sunday, which was huge and very delicious. The ice cream had a great creamy texture and the rum caramel sauce was sweet, but not overly sweet. The bananas were absolutely perfect, cold and fresh, with no impurities at all!   Overall the food was really good (their pancakes are also amazing for breakfast), but the service is what stood out and made the dining experience truly spectacular. Jonel was the epitome of friendly, taking the time out of her busy schedule to check in to make sure everything was perfect and getting whatever we needed. She even spent some time having a nice conversation. Service of this caliber is something I would expect at one of the celebrity chef driven restaurants on the Strip, so Pantry is extremely lucky to have her. I recommend to request her when dining here because she will make your day!",

My husband ordered toast with his breakfast and they forgot to bring it with his food. He finally received his toast after we were both finished and had waited 15 minutes for our check. I would give a better review if we didn't have to waste so much time waiting for toast, check and then again to pay.",

The fried steak came with a side of potatoes as well, some eggs, and toast. I loved the potatoes. It was simple but filling. The chicken fried steak was really good. Perfectly crispy, not too battered, and not too light. Plus the gravy was almost perfect. Just needed a little salt, but nothing there I can't do. The mac n cheese was amazing. I think the noodles were slightly over cooked, but not enough for me to complain about it. It was creamy but not too thick to where you can't finish it. All the food was really worth the prices! It's a cute little restaurant and they do serve good food. They also do have vegan burgers and more choices for vegans, so anyone can come here and find something good to eat! The service was pretty good as well. The servers were attentive and everyone helped one another out. Perfect for parties or even if you want to go alone.",

It was literally the size of a kids meal, and for $16 but that's pretty ridiculous. Our server recommended the cheesesteak to my fiance, and it was good but not great. The fries were really good though. His meal was $19 and the portion was also small. Only other thing we had was a bottle of Newcastle and our bill was $44. We didn't even leave full....and will definitely not return. Service was good......oh well, you win some you lose some. :/",

    "text": "Items Selected: La Colombe Pacific Blend Coffee Cinnamon Sugar Donut Bites Two Cheddar Chive Biscuits - Honey and Butter Blueberry and Banana Nut Muffin Abuela's Huevos Rancheros - Fried Eggs, Black Beans, Corn Tortillas, Cotija Cheese, Avocado Crema, Salsa Chicken & Waffles - Texas Pete Fried Chicken, Buttermilk Vanilla Waffle White Chocolate Brioche French Toast - Berry Compote & Whipped Mascarpone Strawberry Shortcake Pancakes - Strawberry Ice Cream, Vanilla Whipped Cream, Pure Maple Syrup  Long targeted as a place for breakfast given the beautiful space, quality ingredients, and collection of favorites including an ever-changing 'pancake of the week' it was finally with friends in town that I sat down at The Mirage's 24/7 Pantry, a three course order marred only by the confusing menu where dashed-boxes unclearly delineate 'exclusions' to the mix & match bakery section while denoting highlights elsewhere, and not every \"Take The Best Of It - Comes with Smash Browns\" actually comes with the spuds, regardless of what the subtext says.  Offering breakfast all day, and the rest of the menu from 11a until 11p, Pantry is located at the back of The Mirage and with an open cafe up-front overlooking the gaming floor and a more cozy family-style dining area in back it was in the latter that we sat, a large four-top easily big enough for six set for just three soon greeted by a middle-aged waitress named Rina who dutifully pushed coffee (an excellent roast from La Colombe charged at $5 per pot, without free refills, though diners are left to discover that for themselves) before filling water and taking orders, the request for items to be coursed out loosely adhered to until it was reinforced after round two landed atop quarter-finished baked goods.  Told that the donuts could not be included in the 'mix & match' because it was \"in a box, see\" and then served only one biscuit, instead of the menu-listed two, because \"it was part of the mix & match\" as though one was supposed to infer this information for themselves, suffice it to say that at $9 the biscuit and two muffins were still a veritable bargain considering the quality and although the donut bites were a bit steep at $5 for six, the crispy sugar shell over a light brioche center was every bit as good as those at Puck's Postrio which carry a tariff several dollars more - the addition of locally sourced honey, whipped butter, and two types of housemade jam the sort of small details I'd gladly pay a premium for whether dining near home or on the Strip.  Sitting, chatting, and enjoying the first round it was less than five minutes later that a man arrived porting two plates and setting aside the muffins and donuts while informing him to put the brakes on expediting the next course it was soon in chicken and waffles alongside huevos rancheros that we partook, neither served with the 'smashed browns' advertised on the menu but both again showing the work of a confident kitchen working with quality ingredients, the crispy tortillas beneath eggs and accoutrements featuring no lack of dynamic flavors or textures while as the spicy chicken featured skin that crackled to the tooth atop a supple and aromatic waffle more than ready to sop up plenty of pure maple syrup served in a sizeable sidecar.  Transitioning back to sweets, another pot of coffee elected even after assuming the upcharge based on the menu's description, it was perhaps a gluttonous choice to pick both the pancake of the week and four-piece French Toast when eating with friends generally not the sort to indulge in such things but never one to shy away from over-ordering to experience the best of what a place has to offer it was honestly a surprise to even myself just how excellent Pantry's griddles were, the decadent custard soaked brioche cooked golden and topped with rich mascarpone plus plenty of berries featuring far more chopped chocolate than one would have ever assumed while the fluffy flapjack trio was not only topped with housemade strawberry jam and freshly sliced berries but also imbued with strawberries and cream in the batter and layered between each cake, a large dollop of whip and a small ball of ice cream added to finish perhaps a bit unnecessary, though I certainly didn't hear anyone complain. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Confounded by a menu seemingly built to confuse and up-sell with the sort of service that is trained to turn tables it is almost as if Pantry does not know just how good the food coming out of the kitchen really is, particularly for a 24-hour spot on the Strip - a bit more attention to detail from the front of house would go a long way to giving the chefs the credit they deserve.",

The Mirage DESPERATELY needs a good 24 hour cafe and I was so hoping this would hit the mark.  It takes so much for me to not to love a cafe, but I can't give the food here a good review.  It was really, really not good.  I can usually power through a mediocre meal (especially a late night breakfast), so when I can only take a few bites, something is wrong.  I'm hoping the food was just off that night because the ambience was darling and the service was nice.  For a solid breakfast choice I would defer to their poolside cafe and for late night dining, I'm at a loss.",

Their potato sides are called smashed potatoes and they are actually red potatoes which are as described, smashed.  For my money, the best part of the breakfast.  the servers are all very pleasant and service is decent and food arrives pretty quickly.  We did see one poor woman when we sat at the bar to eat who had been waiting for about 40 minutes.  Apparently her order got lost but the bartender did the right thing and didn't charge her for her order.  Had to laugh at the man next to us, he complained to the server that his oatmeal wasn't hot enough and he wanted her to fix it.  Of course the server did just that be we thought it funny since he'd finished it and guess he wanted more so he complained.  People will apparently do anything.",

There were three groups seated before us as we waited in the \"VIP\" line.   We got seated at the front of the restaurant, which provided for a better view of the casino but the draft in there was impeccably irritating. However, the look and atmosphere of the location is cute and welcoming. They were quite busy and we didn't get a chance to ask for a table change.  Our server was Zayra, who was very nice and attentive. However, the service in general was slow, and I had to dash out of that drafty area when we ate and my husband waited to pay for the bill.   Luckily, the food was excellent. We shared the breakfast combination and everything tasted great, even the toast. I'm really glad they didn't get breakfast wrong, otherwise it would be a very sad situation.",

The first morning my friends and I had brunch around 11AM and we waited in line for about 10-15 minutes before we were seated. The first server came by really quickly to take our drink order and then we were greeted a few minutes later by another server to take our food order.  The next day, we had an early breakfast around 8AM and we were seated right away (no wait). The restaurant was not full but it took a little longer for our server to come. My friend ordered a coffee and the server that brought it to us also left the huge pot there (maybe forgot about it, but never came back for it).   My friends and I aren't usually a \"needy\" table but we had everything we needed from the beginning and weren't checked on too often. Among the 3 of us, we ordered 3 dishes and had plenty of leftovers. These dishes are definitely more enjoyable when you share. Price point is average for Las Vegas. You'll be spending at least $14-22 per dish. I would totally come back if I were to stay at the Mirage again and am too lazy to go far for food. Haha",

I was seated right away which is a good thing in Vegas. After looking at all the good stuff I decided on the white chocolate brioche French toast. My old military buddy got the same with a side of turkey bacon. The server comes out to let us know they dropped our food and he brings a fruit plate until we get our new food. The food comes and it's not turkey bacon which is a bummer. But the rest of it was great, so good that 3 tables around us got the same thing :-) . The fruit plate was great also but if you love French toast, get this now.... nice crisp edges with a chocolaty finish and easy to dig in to, no knife needed lol. I would come back more just for the breakfast, if it wasn't a long drive lol.",

Upon first glance at the menu, I saw multiple options that caught my attention so there was no way I could pass up eating here. The decor of the Pantry was also very delightful and reminded me of something that is countryside inspired.  I ordered the fried chicken, biscuit and mashed sweet potatoes with gravy. I must admit it was to die for. The chicken was cooked very well but it lacked seasoning so I ate it with hot sauce. The mashed potatoes were unexpectedly delicious with the gravy. Lastly, the biscuit was absolutely tasty especially with a light spread of butter.",

Located on the casino floor inside the mirage, it is perfectly placed next to hotel elevators.  Surprised that at 3:15 am, we had to wait about 10 mins to get a table.  Place was nicely well lit and spacious.  We got a booth table and was quite big for party of 4.  Perhaps a little understaffed during busy weekend?  Some of the menu choices were not available during the wee hours but we all found something to eat.  The chicken fried steak was delicious, just wished that the portion was a little bit more.  The potato that came with it was good but seemed like that serving was more than the check fried steak.  Service was decent and we got our orders correctly.    Would recommend grabbing bites here.",

Worth ordering is the basil & cheddar biscuits! This helped tide us over while we waited for our meal. The iced coffee is a bit watered down, so next time I'll go with hot.

Prosciutto, roasted garlic alfredo, pesto, mushrooms and roasted peppers. I will literally drive 4 hours to have that pasta again.

The Cesar Salad dressing had the perfect balance of seasonings, not too tart and not too salty, plus they did not over dress the salad. It also had grated Parmesan cheese and crunchy croutons.   The clam chowder was creamy and with a good amount of clams and potatoes. The flavor was spot on and this is from coming back from Seattle tasting the soup from Pike Place Chowder.",

The food is consistently good versus hit or miss.  There were two pasta dishes on the table the nearby Italian eaterie should be envious of.  I particularly liked the bolognese rigatoni.   Two of my friends went wild for their Chicken and Waffles, served with real maple syrup.    My partner in crime and I were going to see POST MODERN JUKEBOX after this meal with a couple we know, while their teens were going to see BEATLE'S LOVE.    This restaurant offers a perfect 'feel' that's informal enough for teens but tasty enough for discerning adults.  It comes off as casual diner (lowering expectations) but then the food knocks it out of the park.   A total WIN.  (Since there's no place yet on Yelp to do this -- you must see POST MODERN JUKEBOX at the Mirage.  It's that classy sexy artsy cabaret that you didn't know Vegas so desperately needed.)",

    "text": "So with Vegas being 24/7 one can score free breakfast here; but truly are you enjoying that breakfast; only because it was free. We all know that most need more money for booze.  But stop and have a decent meal that you will enjoy. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day either at noon or five pm. Plus eggs help with our drinking binges.   Spend some of that dough and get free drinks playing at the slots. Just tip the ladies well that bring your drinks around and they get stronger and stronger.   Now no excuse not to have an enjoyable epic breakfast meal. At the Pantry one can have fabulous breakfast all day at average prices too!  During Mirage themed casino day out the amazing smells and fun atmosphere drew me. I said to myself I know that is a fun and will be a rewarding dining experience! You know what it was!  Any good breakfast starts off with coffee; they offer bottomless cup service for $5.99. It's only regular coffee but it's not too bad. The coffee will not attack you the next day either. It was even good enough coffee that it did not have to be loaded down with cream and tons of sugar! Do the coffee it's a must order!   The Pantry does offer all sorts of delicious options on their menu. It is more of a southern style mix with California spice. But I'm sure all of the food is totally loaded in calories and the bad fat like Southern food. Hey more fat more flavor right!   We ended up ordering the chicken fried steak x2; one for each of the twins. I had a side order of smaller options of eggs sunny side up; and bacon! My good twins ended up sharing some of the chicken fried steak too. Such good little angels love mummy.  The chicken fried steak I did not have high expectations for since usually most places ruin this for me. My bias aside it was a great reintroduction of my relationship with chicken fried steak. I have to hand it to the Pantry it was cooked throughly and was not tough. The True test was after sitting for a few minutes would it be edible. Actually it still was even as it was getting cold!  When we were finishing up our meal the server asked if we needed dessert! I asked her if they could procure a real type dessert; not a croissant. The croissant is not a dessert it is just regular food to me. It contains no sugar or spice. Leave croissant off the dessert menu! After clearing all of this up the word donut came from the server ever so slightly.   Thinking I am paying for the world most average donuts what the heck might as well try them. Wow did I have my mind blown. Their donuts are delicious deep fried dough holes that have sprinkles amply with cinnamon and plenty of sugar. Each bite takes the individual to where Homer goes when he enjoys his donuts.  The service here was above average and during the meal the server came around and filled the water glasses; and left more coffee. I was satisfied with the level of table service. The decor of the restaurant is themed after a Louisiana style kitchen and setting. The tables are large and ensure that you will not be cramped while enjoying breakfast. There are outlets at every table to charge those little vices that we need to make it through our day!   We enjoyed our meal while the phone got a full charge. One must provide their own charging unit for their said device. We will return the next time that craving for fabulous breakfast needs to be satisfied. Now go try it by yourself it is worth it!",

Ok, sorry for not memorizing the menu- not a speed reader!   Let's get to why you're reading this: White Chocolate Brioche French Toast with a Berry Compote- amazing! I didn't use the little pot of syrup that it came with one time as not to run the wonderful flavors of the berries and white chocolate. Blueberry Pancakes were huge and full of massive blueberries. They were delish as well. We ordered a side of Turkey Bacon and that could've come a little crispier but that's on me for not stating. That food is 4 star no doubt.   Please get more cooks in the kitchen (ha!) as it takes a hot minute to get your food!   PS- the latte is something not to miss as well!",

The waiter came by and asked if we had gotten our food yet and we said no, he said that was unacceptable and unbeknown to us he went and spoke to the assistant manager. The food arrived and my husband ordered the Texas Pete fried chicken and that whole plate was fabulous. The chicken was juicy and the potato carrot mash is really amazing. I had the pretzel with the beer cheese sauce and it was really good. We will definitely eat here again. As we were finishing our meal, the assistant manager came by to apologize for the wait time and he told us he took our drinks off the bill as an apology and that dessert was on them. This was completely unexpected and unnecessary for us at least as we were not in a rush this time. We were too full for dessert this time but had a fabulous time here at The Pantry and will be back. Also, every time we go the homemade marmalade's are so very good. It is a must visit just for these.",

Overall, it was good, but it depends on what you ordered. Hubby and I had dinner and late night snacks here and I ordered breakfast to go early one morning. I also had room service from here for breakfast. The eggs and bacon had a slightly weird aftertaste, but since I didn't feel sick afterward and the dish was otherwise ok, I decided it wasn't bad. The pancakes were DELICIOUS, though (had them on 2 separate occasions). Definitely my favorite thing on the menu. Light and fluffy and on the larger side.  Things to know: - If you're a Mirage guest, Pantry is who room service food is from - They are located outside the guest elevators of the Mirage, next to the Samba Brazilian steakhouse - I usually saw the longest wait line during breakfast and dinner - They are open 24 hours - Decor ambience was very cute, felt very homey - Booths are huge (a plus for me!), with a small pail with napkins and utensils at the edge, nice touch - Service was mostly good*  *My only gripe: When I went very early one morning to get an order to go with some coffee, the guy at the counter (bald guy) was a bit dismissive with me and kind of ignored/didn't acknowledge me right away (a simple \"I'll be right with you\" with a smile would've been perfectly fine if he was helping someone else). After I placed the order, I was trying to get his attention again to tell him that I'd be back, but he ignored me again. I tried waving my arms at another server who got eye contact with me, but he ignored me as well and walked away (even though he clearly saw me). I FINALLY had to flag down a female server to tell her my message, and she said she'd tell the counter guy for me (with no apology by the way!). There were a few other tables of people dining there, but only one other person ordering at the counter, so they were not so busy that they had an excuse to ignore me - AND I was not rude at all and polite/nice to everyone. THEN, when I come back to get my order, he gives it to me but forgets my coffee. When I mentioned it, he glanced back and claimed someone must've taken it (which they did not - he never gave me a coffee).  Otherwise, it's a cute place with decent eats and mostly good service.",

We both agreed that the pancakes were the best part of the meal.

Expertly made, soft, fluffy, perfect amount of sugar all around. The order was much bigger than I expected... good bang for the buck. The wedges were also good, but it ended up being too much food.  On another visit I ordered the White Chocolate Brioche French Toast, which had an excellent presentation with mixed berries, berry compote, a touch of whipped mascarpone, and syrup. Unfortunately, the taste didn't match the looks. The bread didn't taste cooked fully, the berries didn't mix well with the syrup (perhaps they were out of season), and the French Toast didn't have a White Chocolate flavor as advertised. The waiter said the bread was lightly dusted in white chocolate, but if I wanted to actually taste the chocolate I should have ordered the chocolate pancakes. Question: why use the phrase \"White chocolate\" French Toast? On the plus side, it was well portioned and a decent price (a few other things on the menu were in the steeper price category). I'd give this dish 3-stars.",

It makes it so convenient too being right by the elevators.   If you come here for breakfast, the line is long. I did a double take watching all the people wait in line each time we walked by the place from the elevators each morning.  I'm curious about trying other menu items... Wait! Actually I did!

It is located  next to the hotel room elevators which makes it convenient for parents and children. You'll avoid having to walk past the casino floor where children aren't welcomed. The place is well lit with friendly staff. Kids menu available.   Only down fall (hence not a 5 star) is that if you need to use a restroom, you won't find one in here. You'll need to exit the restaurant and be forced to walk through the casino floor to the nearest ones.",

Come in and see Janel! She has the sweetest disposition. She will make absolutely sure you leave happy.  Leave room for desert! We loved the apple pie and pound cake.   Also breakfast is a must, you don't expect this kind of place at the Mirage but find it in the back by the guest elevators, it's worth looking for.",

I had seen a line at the Pantry on my way to the elevator, and was pleased to see that there was only one couple ahead of me when I came down.  Sandra greeted me at the hostess stand and engaged me in pleasant conversation while waiting for an open table.  As she seated me I asked where her delightful accent was from.  Soon I was speaking to her in my poor Spanish and she asked if I was from Brasil. (My Spanish is mixed with Portuguese and I speak with a Brasilian accent.)  Soon we were joined by Anna and we all had a good laugh and short conversation before both ladies were back to their busy tasks.  The food was good and the coffee hot.  I particularly enjoyed that both Anna and Sandra come by the table once to check on me and to speak Spanish with the old American who had once lived in Brasil.  They both had me feeling very welcome, like a returning guest rather than a total stranger.  On the way out of the restaurant I had the occasion to introduce myself to Faud, the manager and compliment him on the helpfulness of both of the young ladies and also my waiter, whose name escapes me.  I am here for three more mornings, I expect to eat here for each of them.",

They offer room service  I cannot stress enough on the fact how fast you spend your money if you're living on the strip and eating in the hotels as well.Everything in Vegas has an inflated price hence, I always look for options that are a relatively affordable and the pantry is exactly that.  The menu is not very extensive but food is good. service is a hit or miss because I feel like they are always trying to make room for more people also service does get slow during peak hours.  Average Wait time is 15-20 mins with a separate line for members.  Cheers!",

We ate here 3 times during our stay. 2 times we were hardly acknowledged and drinks were left not refilled. Only one bar tender was great after a night of drinking and food was needed ASAP. He made sure to bring out complimentary toast. The breakfast is just ok - the pancakes were burnt the first time and no flavor. Very disappointing since it's an easy breakfast item. The pretzel with cheese is just ok - the cheese tastes like cheap from the can. Waffle fries were decent and good snack. Only worth it if you are staying at the hotel for its convenience.",

We were not disappointed! There was a short wait to be seated, which I think says something! It was a little pricey but I'm never surprised by this when we come to visit. The service was great, everyone was very nice and attentive even though they were crazy busy. My husband ordered the chicken fried steak, which is one of his favorites, & he really enjoyed it. The country gravy didn't have sausage but we actually like it like that. I ordered the portobello eggs benedict & it was delicious! Aside from the potatoes on the side, it was a little lighter, consisting of poached eggs, vegetables & sundried tomato pesto. The portobello mushroom was perfect! I highly recommend Pantry.",

They are famous for their breakfast i believe and the fact that they're open 24 hours.   However when i came i didn't eat breakfast instead a regular entree. There is a wait time for breakfast i noticed several people standing in line both mornings we stayed here.   In the afternoon, i didn't have a wait and was seated right away. The hosts takes your drink order and then your regular waitress serves you. Their menu will leave you hungry because they offer such a variety! Everything from a delicious salmon to a baked chicken sandwich. Anything you could possibly be craving they offer it and reasonably priced i feel. My salmon was $21 served on top a bed of veggies including carrots, onion, zuchinni and peppers. The veggies were steamed and delicious. They didn't taste like they had been saturated in a ton of oil. I cleaned my plate on the salmon it was perfection and a very hefty piece.   Also a fun fact is that they serve all their drinks even their iced water in mason jars. They do have a happy hour from 3-6pm and again from 1-2am? I might be lying on the late happy hour time but they do serve two happy hours.   I'm only giving this 4 stars because i felt that the service was a tad slow especially when the place wasn't crowded at all. I felt like tables that had more than 1 person in their party got more attention to their drink refills, etc.",

The normal line looked really long; I'm not sure if it's worth that wait-time.  The Mirage hotel is located on the strip, so you'll have to park at the hotel or do the usual walk/taxi to this location.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs; and it was delicious! I thought the flavor of the chicken fried steak was really addicting and the hashbrowns were really crispy. I got over-easy eggs and they were cooked properly. I finished the whole thing!  Bae got the white chocolate brioche french toast. It was pretty well made, but he thought it was a little too sweet; Though, I liked the flavor of it. He put the berry compote on the side, but I thought it went well with it. I even used the berry compote for my bread. I helped him finish it in exchange for giving him some of my Chicken Fried Steak.  The service here is pretty good, but there's a lot of customers and tables. We didn't have any issues with getting items and the check, but I can tell the waiters were busy. Overall, decent service and good, satisfying amounts of food. The price is a bit elevated because of Las Vegas, but I think families will enjoy the comfort and quality of this establishment.",

I did notice a waitress combine a carafe of left over water from two other tables and set it down on ours, so I didn't drink out of that.  Our group of 4 wanted to get a quick and simple egg breakfast at 9:15 AM on a Friday. The line for Pantry was 30 people long, and we were told to expect 20 min and that is how long it took. We were greeted with hot coffee on be table, with cream and sugar too. After ordering the food came out within 10 min, this place is a well oiled machine with fast turnover. I selected the Feta and Spinach Omelette with an English Muffin. I also wanted a side of pancakes, and was recommended the Kid's portion of Peg's Buttermilk Pancakes. The Omelette was healthy, with tomatoes as the dominant flavor and the feta providing some saltiness. The hash browns were simple hash, and the English Muffin came already pre-buttered. Both were average, but I can't imagine the other toast options being better in any sense. The buttermilk pancakes were sizable. I wanted just one, and the kids order was 2 medium pancakes. These in conjunction with the Omelette was too much for a big guy to finish, but could be split with another person. The syrup had a rich flavor that makes me think it was Mrs. Butterworths, and that is good because that is the unambiguous best kind of syrup.",

    "text": "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, no better way to wrap up our Trip in Sin City than with a Simple Meal. As our time in Sin City was winding down, we took the pleasure in just eating at one of the Restaurants inside of the Mirage instead of just venturing out onto the Strip and having us get lost enough for my Dad to flip out. For the entire trip there was one place that caught my eye everytime we past it going to the elevators or we were on our way out to the Strip, this was that Place.  Dad agreed with me and we came down here for dinner, Pantry (in other words a room where Food, Beverages and Dishes are stored). Here in this place stores a Casual 24/7 Dining Experience where customers can select things from Huevos Rancheros, Eggs Benedict, Pancakes, Muffins, Chicken Fried Steak and Smoked Salmon for Breakfast to Caesar Salads, Burgers, Fish & Chips, Clam Chowder, Roasted Chicken and Salmon for Dinner.  The Hostess sat us over in the Far Corner and while we were talking I kept looking and was ever so curious by some of the Quotes that were on the Mirrors. Quotes like: You don't have to cook Fancy or Complicated Masterpieces just food from Good Ingredients, Cooking with Love provides Food for the Soul, Life is short eat dessert First, One should always eat well and visit Often, People who love to eat are always the Best People, If we are what we eat then we should eat something Good, You're the Butter to my Bread and the breathe to my Life, Food is our Common Ground, a Universal Experience, One is not born a Great Cook, one learns by doing and Eat Well, Travel often, good food good Life.  After sitting back down we both got a Beer, one of our Favorites was Sam Adams Boston Lager, taking turns gulping down the Rich, Barley flavor with its light foamy finish. Next up was us both getting a Cup of Roasted Tomato Soup showing a bright Red as I took my spoon down into it and lifted it back up to taste that Sweet, Hearty flavor that Tomatoes develop as they cook in the Oven and the Skin lightly Blisters. Once Again great minds did think alike as we both ordered the Special of the Night, Pan Seared Ribeye with Roasted Fingerling Potatoes, Caramelized Onions, Red Peppers, Mushrooms and topped with Crispy Fried Onions.   As I ran my Knife through and opened it up to be Medium (which how I like my Meat). Tender to my Liking, Same with my Father, the Fried Onions on Top provided some nice Texture, The Potatoes on the side were Tender all the way through and Seasoned Nicely. The Mushrooms were good but suffice it to say I thought that there was too much Red Peppers & Onions on the Bottom that had no business being there (they were more of an Afterthought). Perhaps if there was a Sauce or some Corn or even a Puree (Cauliflower or Leek) something. I mostly did not eat all my Peppers and Onion and just left them on the Plate.  After about 12 minutes of waiting to get our Check, we decided if we actually wanted to do anything else before going back up to the Room. I suggested going to the Bellagio Fountains (despite my legs being Severely Sore) but he said no. The food was good for the most part as we headed back up now knowing where to find a Well Stocked Pantry. !!!",

Like how do you mess that up-when you're drunk all you want is food, it can usually even be bad and you'll still like it. But now that I'm sober I realize it was just so bad I couldn't even eat half that burger.  They are technically vegetarian friendly but they're veggie options are not very good. It's in a casino so parking isn't fun but that's pretty typical. It's open late which is a huge plus if it was good!! Also staff seems super unknowledgeable, when  I asked for a veggie burger, the waiter was confused but it's on the menu.  Anyways they could possibly deserve less stars than two- very underwhelming",

However, the service inside was sub par. Our waiter ignored us for the whole meal. Seemed almost intentional. I had the country fried steak. Um... I could poke my gravy and it just bounced back. It wasn't skin. The gravy just sat there. Like a tree, planted by the waters. I cut it and it sat there.  My friend ate their steak and eggs, though we both agreed that everything was bland and under-seasoned. Maybe it was my fault for expecting good gravy and anything \"country\" in Vegas. Maybe other dishes are better. But there are too many options to give this another go. It's not worth the wait in line or the money.",

Everything is just perfectly designed. There is quite a lengthy line to get in, but luckily I had my M-Life card and was able to bypass the long line in a sort of \"fast pass\" process.  I was able to eat here three mornings during my stay at The Mirage. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros the first morning, but ordered the pancakes both times after. The pancakes are to die for. There is no sense in ordering anything else. I am usually an egg/hash brown person in the morning, but the pancakes are so exceptional they changed me! My friend ordered the special which was Devil Food Pancakes. They were out of this world. I ordered the Chocolate Chip pancakes as well as the straight up Buttermilk pancakes and let me say, I am still thinking about them! This is the perfect place to start your day, or end it! Great service too!",

We had to wait in a long line for about 20 minutes before we were seated.  We had a party of 4 and all of us enjoyed our meals.  Our server was very pleasant and nice.  Besides a long wait, the other thing that disappointed us was the price....$100 for 4 of us!!  Ouch!   I know everything in Vegas is expensive, but Wow!  I only had pancakes, no side of bacon.  Hubby had the 2 egg breakfast with a kids size order of pancakes, and the other 2 in our party also had eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  2 of us had ordered coffee, so we had a carafe of coffee on our table.  My husband really liked the little jar of strawberry jam that was on our table.  We had pastries and coffee/juice the next day at a different place...much cheaper.   I may return here again some day, but will remember that this place is pricey.",

The waitress made excuses and acted as though I was crazy for sending the meal back without \"trying\" it first. I saw enough to know I was not eating it.   Sent it back. After 30-40 minutes and the manager and condescending waitress the second attempt was delivered. Food was better but not worth the money. Steak was tough and lacked flavor.

It's in a great location, just passed the guest room elevators which makes it a prime pit stop before and after heading out to the strip. We initially considered coming here for breakfast but found that their options seemed limited, the line too long and the prices too steep. Before heading out for a night of dancing however, the Pantry suddenly seemed more enticing and we stopped by for dinner. Pantry definitely has more of a diner feel to it but it's almost like an upscale diner as its interior is very modern and kept very neat and clean. I ordered the veggie burger and side salad. It was very tasty. The quality of the greens was evident and the dressing wasn't your typical diner ranch but a nice balsamic instead. The veggie patty was so good that I started eating it by itself without the bun - that's not to say that the bun wasn't delicious but I wasn't looking to grow a food baby right before going out. All my friends enjoyed what they ordered. My friend's meatball sandwich looked giant and delicious and I was tempted to take a bite. There was also chicken and waffles at the table and a shrimp pasta. Both were said to be really good. Service here was fast and our server was accommodating of our group of 6 when it came to splitting the bill. If at the Mirage again I would definitely stop by. The food was of quality and reasonably priced and the service was on point. Solid establishment.",

We were sat immediately, however it took the staff about 10 minutes before they even brought us water & took our drink orders. It then took another 15 before someone took our food order. So we've now been in the restaurant for 30 minutes when they START cooking our food. Another 20 minutes goes by before getting our food, which was less than mediocre. They were very stingy with the portions. My sandwich had more bread than turkey, which would have been bearable if it actually tasted good, which it didn't. So 1 hr & 45 minutes later, we left very disappointed, wishing we had just went to the Carnegie Deli.",

What we tried: Pretzels (mustard and cheese dips) Fish n chips Fish tacos Mac n cheese Carrot cake Tropical 7up (half lemonade half 7up) - this one I just made up and they were happy to oblige.  The tastes were divine, I especially loved the pretzels (good for two) which had a crisp shell and chewysofty center.The Mac n cheese had generous helpings of cheese and truffle oil.. yum! But what really made me swoon was the service. We were going to see Diana Ross and just wanted a quick, nondescript bite. I didn't realize we'd find a gem that we're now planning to make part of our regular Vegas experience. Give this place a chance, you'd love it.",

    "text": "The food here is decent and alone would earn Pantry three stars in my book. But the service is so remarkably bad that I can barely justify a one-star review.   Before I even sat down, my waiter tried to get me to pay $5 for water.  (\"It's in a big bottle you can pour for yourself!\") I declined. \"So what do you want to drink?\" I still had not sat down, let alone had an opportunity to review the menu.   I ordered steak and eggs from one of the three or four waiters buzzing around. I still have no idea who, if anyone, was my actual waiter. It took awhile to get the dish out, but unlike my waiters, I was in no hurry to get myself out of the restaurant. Again, the food is decent--and decently priced by Vegas standards, too.   I probably wouldn't have had a chance to try it if my wife didn't stop a waiter from clearing my plate while I got up for less than a minute. I had to tell waiters three times that I did not want my plate taken off the table. I would have gladly taken a refill of my not-five-dollar-self-serve water, but none of the wait staff seemed to notice or care about that.   The final straw, however, was the fourth plate-grab. A waiter interrupted me in the middle of a sentence, grabbed my plate, and asked if he could take it. The plate was still 75 percent full, and I had my fork in the air prepared to take a bite at the time. From start to finish, we were in Pantry for 40 minutes--about twenty five of which were spent waiting for our meal. If the sole goal of Pantry is to get customers out the door, they succeeded wildly. So successful that I will never walk IN their door again, either.",

I ordered the all American breakfast, now i saw that it was $17, thats a lot for a basic breakfast, but i was like..eh..must be good.  First the guy working there was messing with me, he was nice enough, but he thought it was funny as hell to keep saying my breakfast wont be out for 45 mins. I waiting about 15 minutes, no big deal, place was pretty busy. They had a separate person bringing the food, so he seemed confused on who it was for, even though i was by myself.  They messed up and gave me a sunny side up instead of scramble, he said he would just bring another dish with scrambled eggs which is fine. The breakfast was mediocre, 3 crappy strips of bacon, i was hoping for like 6 ridiculous huge pieces for the $17, only two pieces of toast, and the rest was all has brown/hash/casserole, which was good.   So after i pretty much ate all the toast and bacon, the scrambled eggs came out. I had already eaten about 3 bites of the eggs before i realized it was like some crappy powdered eggs, come on.  I cant get real eggs for $17. I was taking my time, and they weren't  rushing me, until the bartender waved over some really obnoxious guy to sit right next to me, I B-lined it out of there disappointed.  I should have gone to Carnegie's for breakfast, the only reason i didn't was it was too busy and i didn't want to wait in line, should have though. Also it was cheaper too,  All in all, I think everything on this menu should be lowered in price by $10 an item. I should have payed like $7 for what I got.",

She was blown away by the quality and quantity of food with the pancakes, she raved about them.  I was not as impressed with my bagel, however, it was a side item and so I wasn't too miffed about that.   The donut bites were amazing but more cake than air (which I liked) and actually tasted like the outside of a corn dog with cinnamon sugar on it.

Perfect for those of us unsure of what time it is and preferring to trust our gut on food choices. - a pot of coffee for the table to share (about 4 cups) only costs $5! Amazing cost-effective option. Wish more restaurants offered it.  Averages: - food quality is mediocre. Nothing to write home about, but good enough to satisfy your hunger. - the ambiance is nice, but a bit bright, especially for those of us nursing Saturday morning hangovers.   Negatives: - our waitress was an inconsistent mix of inattentive and overly involved. She kept us waiting around to place our order, but when she did talk to us, she was a bit pushy with her suggestions.   Bottom line: - I'd go back if I'm not in the mood to stuff myself at Cravings instead.",

We've tried most of the menu so far as, usually ordering half in a sitting as our \"spoils\" meal- each bite is perfectly cooked and portioned as well as creatively presented to match it's homey atmosphere.  On this recent trip our server was Janel. She was extremely attentive. Extremely: 1: We were able to receive happy hours prices just as they were ending with her help.  2: She was friendly, bubbly and reached our table in a timely manner- never too much or too little, leaving all our requests met...  3: even the last minute order change was not a problem for her to fix for us.

Husband has chicken and waffles and we split his smashed potatoes.  Chicken was tender and flavorful (husband could use tiny bit more spice) and waffle was really good, light, sweet and good crust.    Smashed potatoes were really good and will need to just get basic breakfast with eggs and meat next time so can really enjoy those smashed.  Again, service is slow at times. Took forever to get drink refill.",

Although the service was slow then, the food was good enough for us to give it another try tonight months later.   I will never eat here again. They were out of most things on the menu. We decided to just order two soups. The soup wasn't good and came out piping hot to the point where I have burns on my tongue, even after waiting a few minutes. It didn't come with bread and when I asked the waitress she said I couldn't have a single slice but there is bread we could purchase. I don't care about spending money, even the additional $4 for bread wouldn't have bothered me so much but come on its a restaurant that served us nothing while we waited and were out of more things than that which were available.   So yeah, I wish we would've just ate at home tonight or the many other late night establishments in vegas where you can feel they want you to be happy as a customer.",

We didn't say anything because we had already waited too long, but it was clear they just let our food sit there and forgot to bring it to us.

They have tables spread out and humongous booths for you and all your drunk friends to sit in and lol all night. They have coasters and napkins with their name on it, drinks served in mason jars, fresh jam, fresh syrup in metal containers, and all the other cute stuff that were paying for through overpriced Vegas food. Service was definitely friendly, but I thought it was pretty slow seeing as how the place was pretty much empty. Ok hubby had, made to order omelette and the potatoes he said they were very good including the fresh jam for the large slices of sourdough toast. I had the chicken and waffles, comes with one waffle and a piece of boneless chicken. The waffle was vanilla and it packed some flavor. On the other hand the chicken was not that great to me, do not really know what kind of breading and flavor it was but will definitely pass on that. Don't know if I would be willing to come back and try again because it is Vegas, but maybe if I stayed at the Mirage you never know.",

Get over yourself chef- this place is nothing more then a glorified coffee shop, and I'm pretty sure you are nothing more then a cook.  This place is literally located right outside the elevators that lead up to the hotel rooms. If I order a dessert with some kind of ice cream- I know it will slightly melt during my long 2 minute walk back to my room. How about  investing in some small styrofoam containers- like what an ice cream store would give you for ice cream you wanted to take home.  Or how about treating me like an adult and letting me get whatever I want to-go?",

Coffee is $5 and a side of regular size pancakes (2 of them) were  $7. Portions were large and the ingredients used seemed to be fresh and well thought out. Pancakes were fluffy and tasty. Corned beef hash was absolutely amazing-no skimping on the meat here! The egg and grain mustard really pulled it together. My husband had the breakfast sandwich which was a great portion and had a wonderful truffle mushroom mixture that made the sandwich extremely unique and delicious. The decor of this 24 hour restaurant is light, airy and just beautiful. The fixtures are industrial chic and interesting. I really enjoyed my experience here and even though I find it to be a bit overpriced, I would surely come back. Great food, great music, great servers.",

    "text": "We came here twice during our stay in Las Vegas. I would give the restaurant a 3.5 if half stars were allowed, but I bumped it up to a 4 only because during both our visits the service was really friendly.   Food on the first day was really awesome. We went for dinner on Friday. There was no wait and were seated immediately. Not everyone in our party arrived on time, but they let us sit at a table and enjoy our waters without any pressure to order to hurry our other late guests. We had chicken and waffles, the white chocolate brioche french toast, granola and yogurt, and seared salmon. All were so delicious this first night. Chicken was juicy, french toast was AMAZING (so many berries for each bite!), salmon was tender and flavorful.   The next day, we came back for breakfast. We decided to bring another friend since we had a great time the first time. It was busier since it was breakfast time for a restaurant that specializes in breakfast food. So we expected to wait. The line went fairly quickly. They told us 20 minutes to wait and we were seated in 15. Not bad. I told my friend about our great food the night before, so she ordered the chicken and waffles. I ordered the same french toast as before because it was too delicious not to get it again. The french toast was good but not as great as the night before. It was a bit overcooked and dry, especially around the crust. Thank goodness it had berries on it to counter the dryness. My friend's chicken was overly dry. It was pretty disappointing since it was breakfast time and you'd think the breakfast  food would be served better than during dinner time at least to keep people coming during these popular hours. Our drinks were forgotten and we had to ask for them after our food was already served. Our server was a sweetheart, though, and apologized and gave us an extra drink to make up for it. This is why I rounded up the star rating to 4 stars instead of rounding down to 3.   I wish the food could have been more consistent. If we had the second day experience the first time we came, we probably wouldn't have recommended it to our friends. I'm not sure I'll be coming back again. Not sure the third time will be as good as the first time or as bad as the second. So many other choices to eat in Vegas. I enjoyed the service immensely, though. Try the place at least once. See for yourself.   Summary:  Food - inconsistent; delicious the first visit, dry and not prepared as well the second time around.  Service - very friendly; loved it  Recommendation - Hard to say. Try it for yourself. Food may be a hit or miss. Service hopefully will not disappoint, though.",

I had gluten free toast, a boiled egg and ham.  It was great and delivered in 20 minutes instead of the 45 they estimated.  The only issue we had was that the gluten free toast wasn't labeled (it comes in a separate sleeve) so my friend was halfway through a piece before she realized it didn't taste like regular white bread.  My only recommendation would be that they label gluten free as such. After a long day of walking around and actually winning money at Casino Royale, we were tired so we ordered take away so we could go back to our room to watch a Cops marathon.  I had the turkey club on gluten free bread.  It was yummy.  The lettuce, tomato and avocado were fresh and ripe. My friend had a burger and curly fries and based on her \"yums\" it was tasty as well.  And, the lady with the flower in her hair is super nice.",

We were promptly seated and a bus boy took our drink order asap. Once we got our drinks, we qere ready to order. Our servers name was Leah and she is horrible!!! It took her 10 kinutes just to come and take our order. The restaurant was half full. She came over an acted like someone else was suppose to take our order. Funny because i worked in restaurants for many years and know what a section is and who is not attending their section!!! We gave her our order and waited....and waited.... it took a while before we got our order. The food was delicious. This was the only thing that met our expectation. This was delivered by a food runner. Leah didn't check on us to see if we got our food, if everything was okay, nothing!!! It wasnt until the very end when my husband stopped her to get her attention. Finally we got our much needed refills!!! Then we dont see her again until she delivers the check. Wow big surprise!!! Of course the check is messed up. It had food we NEVER ordered. Again, my husband had to get her attention after a long period for her to come and correct her mistake. She returns with the correct check and states \"Oh someone else punched in the wrong items in your check.\" WTF!!! UMMM no this is your table, under your name, and under your badge scanner or code. Why dont you take come accountability for your mistake. Needless to say but we are NEVER coming back. The food is delicious but the staff leaves a lot missing.

There was only one couple in front of us but it took forever to be seated. But not to worry...we had plenty of entertainment from the drunk 20-somethings stumbling around.   We were finally seated and I have to say that it was VERY cold inside. None of us took off our jackets and I was still chilly. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and two people ordered the waffle and one ordered the salmon. It took awhile for the food to arrive...I guess the kitchen was backed up.   My breakfast sandwich was very good and so were the potatoes that came with it. Be sure to ask for extra condiments because I only got a squeeze of ketchup in a little container...not nearly enough. The waffles were good and so was the salmon. Nothing spectacular. I would come here again if I was in The Mirage at a late hour.",

Our food came out and we asked you for items associated with our meal, I.e. a PLATE, ranch dressing, and even to order more food so as not to run you around per individual request. However, you decided to meet us with sarcasm, haughty derision, and a complete disdain for your position apparently. We are service industry veterans and we know that running a server/bartender around per request is the worst possible thing to do, so when you come AT us asking us if we \"would like to list (our) requests\" we are immediately offended by your level of hostility and strongly suggest that you reconsider your chosen profession.",

    "text": "Granted this was after the club let out, but we were one of 5 only tables at the restaurant and the service was excruciatingly slow. Again, this could have been a mirage (ha-see what I did there?) because we were so tired. If you look at their sandwich boards, they have a late night happy hour, I believe it's 12 am - 3 am (call or stop by and ask!).  It's $5 appetizers and $5 cocktails/well drinks. We ordered the dry rub and BBQ chicken wings. Not wanting to be out in the public any longer, we asked if we could get it to go. All in all everything took about 30 min. The wings were really good, and actually a good deal considering there were about 6 wings in each order for $5. The meat was moist and skin was crispy. I didn't think I'd care for the dry rub, but it's got a sweet, hickory, smokey taste that is really well put together.  The staff are courteous, it's a very cute setup with mason jars used as water glasses, and a very country, relaxed vibe.  On another night, we decided to get a burger, this was around 1 am. This time we called ahead and was told that it would be ready in 15 min. When we arrived to pick up our order at the bar as instructed, there was no bartender and no staff. We flagged down a server who appeared to just be standing around and let them know we were picking up a call ahead order. Instead of hunting down a bartender/server, he just told us to wait by the bar and someone should be able to help us and continued to stand in place.  The Backyard Burger ($17) was solid, not phenomenal. Just a burger on a potato bun, with lettuce, tomato, BBQ sauce, and onions. We ordered it with fries and to our dismay when we went to our room, they included two ketchup packets. So we had to head back down for more.  We also asked them to charge it to our room on the phone and were asked to produce a credit card upon pick-up.  I believe this operation is new, maybe opened around September 2014, so it could explain the scatterbrained service. It's a nice option to have being that's it's open 24 hours.",

The service itself is okay (when you get it) and the food is mediocre at best. It seems that the problem is that they're short handed perhaps? Regardless, there is really no excuse for the ungodly amount of time it took to get a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup. When the food finally arrived the sandwich tasted like it was sitting in the kitchen for a while. Room temperature and really unsatisfying, especially after waiting so long to finally eat. Needless to say, I left irritated, unsatisfied and still hungry.",

    "text": "My wife and I had a late meal after the LOVE show last night. We waited in line for about 10 minutes just to get a table. Once seated we were asked for our drink orders. We selected two glasses of wine, a Pinot Noir and waters. It took another 5 minutes more to get our water glasses filled. When our waitress came over to take our meal order another 5 minutes later, she mentioned that they were out of the wine we selected. We order a Merlot as a replacement. My wife ordered the daily soup and grilled cheese sandwich. I ordered the \"Backyard Burger\" and a side of clam chowder. The waitress asked me if I wanted the soup out separate of my burger which I said I could have them brought together. The same question was not asked of my wife. About 10 minutes later our food arrived and when we asked about our wine, the person delivering our food (which was not our waitress), had no clue that we had ordered wine. My wife told this person to cancel the wine order since we had hoped to drink our wine before our meal was served. When I cut into my burger it was medium rare (bright red). I had ordered it as a \"medium\". I flagged down a bus person who took it back to the kitchen to fix a new burger. A few minutes later, the manager came out with two glasses of wine and apologized for the issue with our drink order. He also said that the meat was how they cooked it for \"medium\" but would redo it as \"medium well\". The new burger was OK but even at \"medium well' there was still some pink to the inside.   We finished our meal and got our check. As we were reviewing the charges, we realized that the wine we did get was charged at $14. My wife called over and got a copy of the drink menu only to find that the wine we did order was only $12 per glass. We flagged down our waitress to have her fix the bill. She took it back to the manager and shortly afterwards got a new bill with $4 discount applied. We paid the bill and left.  As convenient this new restaurant is for Mirage guests, the service and food quality are not worth it.   Also it would be nice if the employees had name tags so they could be indentfied as working at the restaurant instead of trying to get someone's attention to ask for our waiter/waitress.",

Carnegie deli was the other one and just didn't sound of interest to me.  I decided to give Pantry a try.  I have to say the menu sounded good normally but I couldn't find much this time that I said I gotta have that.  Instead I had Chicken and Waffles for basically the 3rd time in four days.  It wasn't bad.  The chicken was a little overdone but certainly very enjoyable.  It was also priced very reasonably especially for Vegas. While I give it three stars I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to someone that's looking for a fairly quick meal. It certainly can't hold up to other more fancy restaurants but it's not bad for the price especially.if you have a burning desire to get chicken and waffles I would recommend Hash hash a go go over the pantry",

    "text": "We decided to use a $50 resort credit to get room service.  The Mirage has replaced their room service with Pantry delivery.  I was not impressed with any portion of this meal.  The pizza crust tasted like it was frozen and made by Digiorno.  The truffle potato chips had a great crunch but the flavor on top of the chips was not good.  The pretzel and cheese dip also was unimpressive.  Two pretzels without salt served with a beer cheese dip with little flavor and a side of mustard.  The pretzel itself was decent but the cheese sauce was very plain and in need of seasoning.  The truffle mac and cheese had overpowering flavor of mushrooms.  Like the beer cheese dip this dish also lacked seasoning.  Finally the cinnamon doughnut bites were the one saving grace of the meal.  Warm and soft they brought some happiness to an otherwise lackluster sampling.  I would not order from the delivery option or visit his restaurant again.",

My review is for room service because guests at the Mirage can order from the Pantry menu. The menu in the room had a nice selection of breakfast foods such as omelettes, pancakes and other morning items. It also included hamburgers, club sandwiches and salads. I selected an omelette with toast and potatoes. I placed my order via the hotel room phone and the lady that took my order was extremely friendly. She told me my food would be ready in 20-30 minutes and verified my room number. I heard a knock on the door in 20 minutes and a gentleman with a pantry paper bag with handles stood at my door. The food was delivered in a bag that reminded me of a shopping bag and was not on a traditional tray. The room service deliverer handed me my receipt and also reminded me that the receipt stapled to the bag had the last 4 digits of my credit card. That was a nice security measure and I appreciate that. The bag contained the omelette on a plastic plate with a lid, silverware, and mini condiments. Everything was included and my omelette was delicious. The toast had a buttery taste and potatoes were perfect with the omelette and ketchup. The price was not bad either ($20). I highly recommend ordering breakfast for any meal at the Pantry. In Vegas there is no sense of time anyway so breakfast for dinner or at 4am is perfectly fine.",

I order one of the drinks, expecting two. Server returns with one. I ask, where is the other one? He states that the two drinks that I ordered, are in the one cup.   Two other couples observed our server trying to explain, and asked us what was the deal. There is no deal. Apparently, the 2-for-1 drink special they advertise is for looks, and draw, but in the end, you get ripped. Ok. Kinda tricky there.   Our server was nice enough to fix it without asking, so he saved the day. No one wants to argue at breakfast, wtf. Potatoes were delicious. They weren't hash browns or potatoes o'brien. It was a nice unique mash potato fried with seasonings hybrid. Waffle was perfect. It was crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside. I drowned it in butter and covered it with an egg. I enjoyed the breakfast here.  We were lucky (in Vegas?) enough to get there at a time where the rush built up after we were seated and eating. Almost every time I passed the place on my way to the room, there was a bit of a wait.",

    "text": "24-hour dining with mildly healthy options is a rather cool thing, if executed well.  SERVICE. I can understand it being slow during the wee hours of the morning, but at 2 pm on a weekday, service was incredibly slow, despite the place being 3/4 empty. It took 30+ minutes for our table to get 2 burgers and a salad, which seems excessive. Flagging down a waitress for the bill later was quite time consuming as well.  THE FOOD. The portions are massive, which is good, since the prices are fairly high too. You definitely get  a decent bang for your buck, and the food is fresh, but altogether fairly heavy. A cobb salad came with at least a cup of crumbled blue cheese (if not more), along with an overload of other ingredients as well. And as there are no fridges in the rooms, you'll more likely than not be wasting most of your lunch.  It's better than grabbing fast food, but if you're in Vegas for the food, I would skip this place for sure.",

The coffee was so good and served in a huge cup. The cream was served In a tiny little milk jug thingy and I thought it was cute. LOL Hubby had regular pancakes although the specialties looked marvelous. I had the waffle and it was literally the best waffle I have ever tasted. It had strong vanilla undertones and so fluffy and crispy on the outside.  It also had fresh fruit on top. The syrup was good. We both walked away happy and full because the portions were huge. Great food, great service and great ambience...5 stars all the way! Also...Apparently they serve breakfast 24/7 and the menu looks like everything might just be as  amazing! There is also a bar.",

We simply came here because we were hungry and we needed a place that had gluten-free options as a guest of ours is allergic to gluten. And seeing that we were going to see LOVE following dinner, we wanted to ensure our guest was comfortable and would enjoy the show.  Just a heads up, if you're playing My Vegas, the Pantry reward is only good in the morning.  My nephew had the Backyard Burger, no bun which he said he enjoyed.  My niece ordered the Mahi tacos, which she really enjoyed.  My husband ordered the chowder and the loaded waffle fries. Which I thought was just okay.  And for me, I got a half Cobb salad and the truffle mac and cheese. Which I thought was just okay.  Customer service was good. I was bummed when the check came before we could ask for dessert. But that's okay as I thought this would give us an opportunity to go elsewhere for desserrt after the show.  Total experience was just okay.",

We went twice for breakfast when we stayed here.  Sit by the bar and enjoy the 2 bearded twins' (not actually twins) humor.  The two guys behind the bar are really funny and nice.  You'll probably enjoy your meal more talking to them rather than waiting for a table.  Their breakfast sandwiches are large!  Large enough to share.  And they come with the smash browns, which are buttery and delicious.  We also tried their pancakes, equally delicious and large.  The doughnuts are also worth getting.

I got the chocolate pancakes, my sister the regular buttermilk pancakes, and my parents the brioche white chocolate French toast. WARNING: the regular serving of pancakes are three HUGE pancakes. No normal human can finish them. We ordered the little griddle sized pancakes, which were the perfect size: just big enough to leave us full but not overstuffed before a busy day in Vegas. That being said these pancakes were DELICIOUS MELT IN YOUR MOUTH GOOD. The French toast was also tasty, and presented beautifully.   The decor was adorable, with mason jars as glasses and cute little syrup pourers. The food took awhile to come out though, and the we had to flag down our waiter to get refills on our waters. Overall a lovely breakfast and I would definitely return for more pancakes!",

We had a comp so, we wanted to try a variety of dishes from the menu and the dessert, but the oven was broken so we could not receive the warm caramel cookie skillet and ice cream dessert.  However, I ordered the chicken and waffle, and it was okay.  Although it wasn't entirely busy, the food seemed like it took awhile to come out.  It was also a little difficult to hear our conversation as the noise from the hotel and the different conversations taking place inside of the restaurant almost drowned out our voices.  However, the one saving part about this place were the televisions they had behind the bar.  Now, if you come here for breakfast, the line is long. Other than this, the restaurant is fun and a nice place to grab a quick meal before heading upstairs to your room.",

    "text": "The coolest thing about Pantry is probably that it's open 24/7. This makes it quite convenient. I had two meals there and I think my room service was made by Pantry, so technically that's three meals there in three days. The food is good and if you make the right choices, you can eat good food at a food court price in a pretty restaurant.   My first time there, I ordered peppermint tea and cheddar biscuits. The tea was brought to me in a white tea pot and I had at least three cups. I've had better cheddar biscuits in my life - they weren't overly cheddar-y, but they were good enough and quite filling. They were served with honey and butter, for which I can't vouch as I had neither. I think the total was $6 before tax.   I had a very early meal at Pantry the day I left Las Vegas. I ordered a grilled cheese and tomato soup, but they were out of tomato soup and wouldn't be abler to serve any more until after 11 a.m. when they started lunch again (I think they serve only breakfast between 5 or 6 and 11 a.m.). I was served fries even though I hadn't ordered them, but I wasn't charged for them. The grilled cheese was good. I'd have it again. I also had Pantry's ice cream sundae. I don't recall whether that was the official name of it or whether it was called something else. It was very large and I could only eat about 2/3 of it. I believe it had strawberry, vanilla and chocolate ice cream with hot fudge.   If you're staying at the Mirage a few days, take advantage of Pantry.",

Bonus:  I am disabled, have trouble walking-- it is very close to the hotel elevators, making it easy for me to get to from our room.  Loved the decor-- BRIGHT, very WHITE, cheerful.  Has a little bit of \"country\" theme...  homemade jam served in sealed Canning jars (jam was delicious), silverware in crocks on the tables, cream served in mini milk pails; etc.  Nice touches.  Food is a little bit pricey, but we thought good.  We had two breakfasts here and I had a late afternoon \"snack\" of a bowl of Chicken Tortilla soup.   All good.  Loved the feta-spinach omelet and the smashed browns (instead of hash browns) and my biscuit. Husband had some great pancakes.  And the coffee wasn't too bad either (we're from Seattle and we are picky about our morning drink!!)  There is a Counter as well as tables and booths  We had fairly fast service, and it fit the bill for what we needed in the mornings.  And again-- I just loved the decor.  If you are feeling tired, the bright white should wake you up!  And now that we hate the new ordering system at Carnegie Deli, glad the Pantry was there to eat at instead. *(Carnegie Deli in the Mirage changed to a system of ordering at a window-- hated it!!)",

Our favorite Cobb anywhere and our favorite thing here.   The breakfast is pretty good. Recommend the smash potatoes (crispy and creamy) and the sausage links (slightly sweet). The full breakfast items are solid, with no real standout. For example the eggs Benedict is hit or miss (hollandaise quality).  Slightly on the pricey side, but fair for Vegas. Service is poor when they are busy and very good when they aren't. Sounds obvious, but it's a consistent truth at this place.",

I love their menu which is breakfast, or eat this if not interested in breakfast.  They have a \"delivery service\" to any hotel room.  It's pretty much the same menu, only the room service menu had pizza which I didn't see on the menu outside the restaurant.  I'm guessing if you asked for it though, they would make it for you.  (Don't quote me on that, just saying it makes sense since it probably all comes from the same kitchen.)  I placed the order, simple - they told it would take about 45 minutes and I'm thinking - what's the deal?  Are they ordering Dominos and slapping it into a Pantry branded box?   Well it actually only took about 30 minutes and the pizza was delicious!  I couldn't eat it all so I took it home (in California) the next day and microwaved it and it was still good.  The mark of a good pizza.  They sent everything I needed like parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, etc.  All in a little bag.  The plastic plate was even fun because it felt like a fancier plate than a Walmart special.    It's room service prices, so $19 for a pizza, plus a $3 added fee and tax.  However, $25 for a hand delivered pizza to a hotel room at midnight, it's actually a good deal. I can spend that ordering from Pizza Hut at home.  The room was automatically charged and even though they had room to write in a tip, I tipped cash.     Overall, a great experience.  hank you!",

We did not wait long to be seated. I just have to add that I fell in love with the Pantry's decor. It feels as if you walked into someones home. The service was great, but the food...  Food was yummy. My friend order the soup of the day, which was a sausage potato soup I believe. Let me just say that I regret not ordering this soup for myself. I had a taste of it and wanted to steal it from my friend. It was THAT good. My corn beef hash was yummy. Poached eggs, slow cooked corned beef, potato, grain mustard hollandaise was legit and lets not forget the mimosa. I was a happy camper.  the only dish I was not much of a fan BUT looked delicious to look at was the seared salmon. Roasted young potatoes, vegetables, arugula salad, lemon vinaigrette and the Soup of the day...the lobster bisque I ordered for room service. The salmon was lacking flavor and the poor dab of lemon vinaigrette tasted more like mayo. The potatoes also lacked flavor and they were a bit undercooked. The lobster bisque was lacking the lobster. I've had lobster bisque in the past and i've had pieces of lobster in my soup. Not the case with this soup. It wasn't all to bad but it needed more of the lobster flavor.",

The one part that needed work that day was the hosting. They told us it would be a five-minute wait for two people and said we were next. Then they would disappear while a line built up at the podium. When they returned, they would get overwhelmed, not look anyone in the eye, take more names down and disappear again.  15 minutes later, they were finally ready to seat us. Once seated, the experience was pretty decent.",

I ordered the chicken fried steak - the portions were generous but the food was salty and seemed microwaved. My bf got the backyard burger.

Two of us shared the breakfast sandwich and the other had an omelette and we all really enjoyed it. Sandwich was def large enough to be shared. We came back the next night for a 3am snack and shared French toast, and biscuits and gravy and it was all gone in a matter of minutes! We had another midnight snack during the trip of chicken wings! Super yummy! And on our last morning we sat at the bar and ordered a bagel and biscuits from the bakery which were cheap and filling. My single complaint is that the water had a funny taste to it, but everything else is great! If you come around Vegas morning time (11am) be prepared to wait in line.",

We came here around 9:30 am on a Sunday and there was a short 20 minute wait for a table of 4. When we sat down, they already had a carafe of hot coffee ready for us.  We ordered a few things for the table to share: French toast, eggs Benedict, pastrami hash and cheddar biscuits. All the food was pretty ok in general. I thought all the dishes were pretty bland and needed lots of hot sauce. I opted for Tapatio because I didn't like the jalapeno one that everyone raves about. The pastrami hash had giant chunks of fat in it that I had to spit out once I started chewing. I did like the shaved ham in the eggs Benedict though. However, I've definitely had better brunches.  The decor in here follows the lines of industrial chic so I loved sitting on the booth and sipping my coffee. They also have food-related sayings that seem inspirational.",

I didn't really want to go there, but since pickings were slim, decided to eat here, not go on a mission to find something else, somewhere else.   We were quickly seated. Our waiter was nice, and attentive , but that's pretty much the positives.  My husband and I decided. To split the Grilled Shrimp Penne pasta and the Chicken wings ( two ways ) to drink I ordered a coffee and Bailey's.  The coffee was WAY too strong. In addition to the Bailey's, I had to add cream, sugar in the raw and a sugar substitute to make it drinkable. Normally I would add a touch of milk and a half sugar substitute to taste the creamy goodness of Bailey's but this time it was barely noticeable.  The pasta I did not enjoy at all. It was billed as a \"Bigger\" item, but only had 5 over cooked shrimp in it ( my husbands one shrimp still had a shell on it so it totally turned him off ) I actually found the shrimp was the only thing I liked in it. The pasta itself was way too \"saucy\" yet very bland. I also didn't like the tomatoes nor the ham- I barely ate any of mine.   The chicken wings I also didn't like. They were half lime chipotle (again I found these too saucy / fatty and undercooked despite my request to get the wings well done) . The other half was a dry BBQ rub. This was a bit better but I only ate 1. The wings also came with carrots and celery .  Shortly after we arrived, it became so loud that we could barely converse.  We got cranky and put us on edge - exactly what we didn't want.",

    "text": "We ate here several times while staying at the Mirage, and had mixed experiences.  The decor here is very nice and a lovely change from standard Vegas strip/casino restaurant style.  It is a light, bright, country store in the 1920's style - perhaps something you'd expect walking into the book Fried Green Tomatoes.  It's tasteful and restful on the eyes after all the bright lights and jarring colours elsewhere.    Our first stop was in the evening.  My husband and I had been out walking the strip all day and were desperately hot and thirsty, and wanted a snack before the show we were headed to (Terry Fator!) but weren't ready for dinner.  The service was friendly and exceptionally prompt and thorough.  The waitress was chatty in a nice way, and the food was fabulous.  Our second stop was in the morning.  I was meeting my parents - who were also staying at the Mirage - for breakfast.  The coffee arrived promptly, but after taking our order, the waitress vanished for a long period of time.  Finally, a food runner came and deposited pancakes - my dad's order - in front of him, but the rest of the orders didn't match.  My dad had already grabbed the butter and his knife, was readily doctoring his pancakes when they were swooped out from in front of him, the butter taken from his hand, and the food served to another table.  I mean, ew.  I know my dad, so it's fine, but if it had been my food and I'd seen that happen?  I'd have been horrified.  As we watched several tables seated well after us receive their food, we started to wonder about our own.  We hadn't seen the waitress in some time, so finally flagged her down.  She promised to check on our food and got us some additional coffee.  After quite a long wait again, our food arrived.  My suspicion is that the waitress hadn't put the order in until we asked her about it, due to the timing involved.  The blueberry pancakes were exceptional, and my extra crispy bacon order was fantastic.  My parents loved their food as well, but it took us a long time to get cream refills for the coffee and even to get the check.  I feel as though the waitress may have had too many tables or somesuch as she seemed very, very harried.  The next day we gave it another go for breakfast.  I didn't have much of an appetite so decided on just a bagel, which was very good.  Service was fair, not as bad as the day before, not as good as the first day.  It took quite a bit of time once more for coffee refills.  Overall, I like the food here very much and appreciate that it is open 24 hours.  However, breakfast time service seems a little hit or miss.",

The flavors of everything was phenomenal.  I had the eggs, bacon, Smashed potatoes and English Muffin and they took my breakfast to the next level!  Wow the Chef here can truly excite your taste buds!  The best part was that it was super affordable!  I encourage everyone to give this place a chance and ask for Colleen!",

    "text": "I have been coming to The Pantry for years. This is my go to when I stay at the Mirage, or I am in the area and looking for a good breakfast. This is also a great place for lunch options and honestly you can't go wrong with late night eating if you're not wanting to eat fast food during the late night-early morning hours.   The food has been consistently good at least. For Breakfast, my favorite is their Steak and Eggs. You can get the steak cooked to your liking, eggs in any style you want and it comes with their delicious potatoes and choice of toast. This is my go to for early breakfast or late night eats. My lunch time favorite has become their Brisket Cheese Steak with caramelized onion and arugula on a ciabatta roll. This comes with a side of their delicious wedge cut fries. Cannot go wrong with either one of these. They also have delicious pancakes and French toast which you cannot go wrong with.   The only thing lacking lately is the service. The last two times we went in, the servers have been distracted, sometimes talking to each other while taking our order which resulted in them missing part of our order. When we visited with my husband's grandma who frequents The Mirage quite a bit, the server forgot to put in her order of the two items she requested, because he was talking to another server while taking our order. This is why I am deducting two starts. While the food has been great, when it is not busy I think clients deserve attentive service. Specially when a client ordering is an elderly person and it takes effort for them to give the order, grandma should not have had to repeat herself 3 times to the server due to him talking to another service AND still MISSED the two items she requested. Simply unacceptable, and due to their error I feel that one of her items should have been compted since she wanted an extra 15 minutes after everyone had already received her food. Most of the servers here are great and attentive.  I probably will be back at some point, and I hope that when I do, that aspect of the service has changed. It would be a shame if it didn't since the food is really good.",

Upon looking at the menu - it looked promising - very pricey well named food. We decided to order huevos rancheros and loaded potato waffles. What was delivered to us -- was below subpar. Instead of huevos rancheros we got what seemed to be a scooping from a pig trough and the loaded potato waffles were nothing but criss cut fries soaked in velveeta cheese. Left with a very empty pocket, an unhappy stomach, and still very ashamed and sweaty. I give it a two star because I was very entertained with the man cleaning the joint because he stared aimlessly at nothing for minutes at a time.",

We had to wait a bit for a table for six, but it was easy for all the couples.   We ordered happy hour foods: $5 calamari bowl, $5 chicken wings (6 wings), and then two kid's meals: the waffles with fruit and whipped butter, and the turkey sandwich with fries. Then when my parents came to join us, we ordered truffle mac and cheese and the ribs entree.   We got our waters and a milk really quickly, but the waitress took some time to take our orders. The food took a bit to make, but not too bad.   Calamari: Not great, it was crunchy, but the breading left a lot to be desired. It surprisingly wasn't salty enough, and was really tasteless- but REALLY crunchy. I wouldn't get it again. Came with limes and the usual marinara sauce.   Chicken wings: pretty tasty. Good amount of sauce. Came with ranch.   The turkey sandwich: I didn't eat it, but it was pretty thick, so lots of turkey, mayo, and fries!   The waffles: the best part of our meal. I asked for whipped cream on the side, and well, I basically used the waffles as a vehicle for whipped cream delivery. So good.  Truffle mac and cheese: Truffle flavor is there, but there wasn't enough cheese! It just seemed like eating pasta with truffle oil.   The ribs: sauce is super salty (hah!), I couldn't withstand eating more than one rib (at that point in the meal).   Good: waffles (kid's dish) Meh: truffle mac and cheese, ribs Bad: Calamari  If I could, I would just go in and order all the kid's meals. They're the cutest, smallish servings, so you can try a lot of the dishes. :P",

The food is good too and is served in a very attractive way. Service is a bit slow, but is very attentive and courteous. There are nice kids' menu choices. Side orders and beverages are pricey - $7 for bacon, $3 for one toast, $5 for V8 - I took one star off for that as I think these are a bit ridiculous for the type of place Panty is.",

They are delicious and the Jalapeno hot sauce is absolutely delicious but isn't sold there. Trust me, I would buy a bottle every time I visit. We did order the loaded fries with all the fixings on the side, my boyfriend is a picky eater. We also tried the pancakes for the first time, let me just say they were perfect. Subtly sweet. My only complaint is that the service is slllloooowwwww. So if you are starving, be prepared for a long wait for your food",

Our drinks came out fast and my vodka and cranberry had enough kick to get me buzzing off the first one. No skimping on the pour here.  Janel was our server - loved her! Attentive, helpful, funny.  Manuel brought our food out and he was really funny as well.   Now the food - the caprese flatbread was decent.  Didn't knock my socks off. I got the alfredo and subbed chicken for the shrimp. The noodles were over cooked but the sauce was not really heavy or too salty. Chicken was moist and tasty. So aside from the noodles being over cooked, this dish was tasty. My coworker liked her salmon and fingerling potatoes with arugula.    Overall good experience here and I'm so glad we gave it a try.",

The service here is what made me give it the 2 stars.  It's like everyone here has ADD or something.  It took them 45 minutes to bring our food to us, only to forget some items, like my bread.  We asked 2 different staff members for my bread and both forgot again.  It was given me 20 minutes later.  For the most part the food was okay.  I ordered the steak and eggs, which my steak was cooked medium when I ordered Medium Rare. The mac and cheese was gross and that had to be sent back. This place needs an overhaul on the staff before I would consider coming back.",

My sister, who likes sweets also ordered a side of blueberry pancakes (2 pancakes) which were also very tasty.

I was eating healthy so I had an egg white omelette filled with veggies, a piece of toast and a bowl of fresh fruit.  My girlfriends had pancakes and waffles, all which were amazing.  They have a little bit of everything for everyone, and I especially liked the fresh jelly at the table for my toast.  The restaurant itself is large, but the decor is cute and quaint giving it a more intimate feeling.  I would recommend Pantry to anyone looking for a yummy sit down breakfast/brunch.",

Every time though the line was way too long for us to wait so we usually opted for something easier. It wasn't until after a REAL late night after the club (3amish) that we saw no line!   Not entirely hungry for a huge meal our group was looking to satisfy a sweet tooth. Surprising the dessert options were very very good! Our group decided to share mason jars, apple pie, and sundae. All three desserts hit the spot! Maybe it was the late night munchies or maybe it was the warm apple pie (wink wink) but our decision to stop by the pantry was a good one.  So if you're staying at the Mirage and are looking for a good food option stop by the Pantry. After trying it I can understand why the lines were as long as they were. In comparison to the Mirage's buffet, I'd take the Pantry any day!",

This is my second visit here; first time in Dec. 2014 and second time was April 2015.   This most recent visit was a good experience. The only red flag I had was the pace of service. We came around 9pm on a Wednesday night. We could see everyone was working hard - it took about 5 minutes before we were picked up but our server acknowledged us prior to the wait and we told him to take his time.   We ended up ordering the Homespun Potato Chips for our appetizer. The dip had truffle oil, mushrooms and spinach (I think?). Pretty good. I also ordered a bowl of clam chowder. This is something I would definitely recommend, especially if you're a chowder fan. Even if you're not though, my boyfriend who usually steers clear of all chowders gave it his seal of approval. Lastly, for his meal, my boyfriend ordered the Steak & Taters. Ordered the steak medium and it was cooked to perfection. Super tender and juicy and it actually had a great flavor to it - no steak sauce necessary.   No complaints about our meal - except the loud & obnoxious table near us. But that's not the restaurant's fault. Our meal including tip was an even $50.",

Decent prices (for the strip) and I literally had the best pancakes of my life here.  I was at the Mirage for four nights on a recent work trip and did not have a car.  When I checked into my room there was a picture of the Pantry's pancakes on the cover of the room service menu.  They looked scrumptious so on day two I succumbed to my yearning for pancakes and went downstairs.  So you know how usually the picture never looks like what you actually get when it comes to food in restaurants?  Not this time!  The pancakes looked as good, if not better than the picture and tasted exactly as great as the description said they would.  Served with butter and warm real maple syrup.  If you love pancakes, give them a try here -- totally worth it.",

When we arrived at around 8:30 in the morning we were seated immediately. The restaurant was charming and whimsical. Our waiter Christian was very prompt and helpful with his service. We ordered the cheddar and chive biscuits with honey butter. My husband I shared this dish and it was incredibly light, flaky and delicious. I ordered the white chocolate brioche french toast with berry compote and whipped mascarpone. Sounds really good right? Well, it \"was\" good, but it was not as amazing as it sounded in the description on the menu. I was waiting to taste the white chocolate, but I never did. It was just berries and french toast. My husband had an omlett, which was good, but the breakfast toast was incredible. Our bill was around $50 with tip, so this is not super expensive, but not a place on the cheap either. We recommending this spot to our family, so I would definately recommend to other visitors to Vegas!",

    "text": "JANEL made our dining experience at 24 Pantry awesome!  We were at MGM to see Beatles LOVE and just randomly selected this place to eat.  When we first arrived one of my daughters wasn't feeling well and Janel immediately got her some gingerale to help settle her stomach.  She gave us great menu recommendations as we weren't sure what we were going to order.  While my daughters and I were dining, my brother and his girlfriend stopped by to say hi and Janel was so gracious and helpful.  She made sure another table was pushed over to ours to make sure we all could sit together.    As you read this review it sounds pretty typical of what a server should do - and it is.  What made it different is that she was so kind and genuine.  She really took the time to chat with us even though she was busy.  She really listened and was so friendly.  She takes relationship building in a small amount of time to the next level.  Relationship building is big part of my business so I am a pretty good at gauging this.    When my daughters and I left we talked about how awesome she was and we all said that we definitely needed to write a review about her.  I have been home from Vegas for about 2 weeks and finally had time to go through and look for my receipt. I sat down and immediately to write this review, that's how much of an impact she made!  Thank you Janel for your awesome service and wonderful and genuine smile!",

They were ok , very bland , almost tasteless w/o the pico de gallo and salt i had to add. Chef... Put some flavor on this food already. Fiance got the brisket cheese steak sandwich. He scarfed the first half down because he was starved but admitted it was also quite tasteless and for a big eater left the rest behind. Looked like a slice of fatty boiled roast beef on a roll with some horseradish cheese. Ill give 2 stars only because the line is out into the casino for breakfast and from what i could see and smell from walking by every morning im thinking the breakfast there is the way to go . Also.. We waited forever for our food to come out and even longer after we were finished for our check. Good luck finding your waitress , be sure to ask for everything you need with your order because if u need some ketchup or ranch your food will be cold and dry by the time they come back with it.",

It was average lunchtime but despite dozens of staff the tables were not being flipped with any urgency whatsoever.  Finally got in.  Waitress didn't bother giving us any drinks menu.  or kids menu.  instead we were shoved towards a table by a waitress that lost interest in the job in 1974 and at this point overwhelmed us with her indifference. Her taking the drinks order (when she finally provided the menu) was done shouted across the room.   I actually had to go into the kitchen prep area just to find her to get to finish the order.   Got the drinks and she took the food order,  She got it wrong (pressed the wrong button apparently).   Food quality was poor.,  Cold, congealed cheese sauce for the pretzel dip. Under cooked kids burger (red and dripping) - a food health hazard.  Our waitress or indeed anyone to help were missing,  Shift manager was missing (naturally).   Last little sting in the tail is that there is no restroom - nearest one is a long long trek across the casino floor.  Never returning to this nasty little kitchen run by indifferent staff who really couldn't care less about service or my family.  No tip (first time ever for me) and I told them why at the time",

    "text": "4 stars for food, but not good service if they're busy. We actually just paid for our coffee and left. They did their best to sit everyone in line, but apparently the cooks couldn't keep up and our older waitress gave total attitude when we said we just wanted to pay for our coffee and leave. We had seen people who came before us still waiting for their food, and they're waitress told them it was a 25 minute wait for food. Wish they would have told us....plus we waited over 10 minutes for a waitress to even take our order. The worst was the attitude we got when we said we needed to go. We'd eaten there twice this weekend but this last trip makes us not want to return. Now here we sit at Starbucks... At TI....eating our delicious plastic bag pastry before our \"25 minute wait time\" would have been up.",

    "text": "After quite a long and grueling day at a trade show here in Las Vegas, my employee and I we're more than ready to have dinner as quickly and conveniently as we possibly could. When we came into the pantry 24-hour restaurant, we were greeted, seated and given menus cheerfully and promptly. The menu was very clear and geared toward American Diner cuisine and specializing in breakfast all day long as well. We were ravenous for dinner and I ordered the braised salmon which was great. However the greatest highlight was our waitress whose name was Janel. She was so prompt, cheerful, attentive, helpful and caring about how every aspect of our meal was and it was great. The thing that I really liked the most was kind of unexpected. She said after every response to her queries about our dinner \"My pleasure\", which I love for anyone serving another person to say as opposed to today's typical \"no problem\" reply which is most commonly heard almost everywhere. Great job Janel, we'll be back tomorrow night to see you again for dinner!  R.C.",

Janel was the name of our server extraordinaire, but truthfully, every server, regardless of the time of day that we visited was warm, inviting, had great suggestions, and were attentive.",

The American breakfast was a solid 8 out of 10. The French Toast disappeared faster than all the other orders. Oh, and the coffee and tea called for refills, which was easy with the carafes at the table. Why walk elsewhere when you can get all this here?",
