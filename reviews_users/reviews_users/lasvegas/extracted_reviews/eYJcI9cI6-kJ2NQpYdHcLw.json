    "text": "Went here on Friday, a little before noon. Was unplanned though. We initially wanted to go to Eat. because of the Yelp reviews, but they were busy. Saw this place pop up on the search for brunch, but... They only serve brunch on Sundays from what I overheard. LOL. Too late. Once we were seated and looked quizzically at the menu, our server had already introduced himself. Not going to lie, my sister was intrigued by the menu by then too.  It was also cool to have the host recommend Eat. to other patrons that were looking for brunch. Shows how supportive the area was of other establishments, and honest to a certain extent.  Let's see...  I ordered a Bloody Mary, and for appetizers we ordered the Tuna Tartare and Margherita Flatbread. Our server, Rodney, seriously persuaded me to order the Bloody Mary. Hahaha... Not that it takes much to convince me when it comes to drinks. I was sold on the idea of mixing it myself 'cause sometimes bartenders tend to make it too spicy for me. Anyway, we both liked his style which wasn't too pushy to make us order more, and helped us relax in trying a new place. He was pretty much like \"If you guys are still hungry after your appetizers, and just want to hang out here a little longer, then just order more later. No pressure.\"  Oh my gah... The Tuna Tartare... I was lucky to even get a third of that plate! The taro chips were yummy by itself, and the tartare had fresh ingredients that paired nicely with the raw tuna. My sister seriously didn't want to share! The Margherita Flatbread was just as yummy - I always like it when the tomatoes are baked along with the rest of the ingredients, and having the basil be the fresh part of the dish. Coming back to check on us, and joking about how fast I needed a second Bloody, we ordered entrees... Goujons (sweet Thai chili) with fries added (technically an appetizer) for the sister, and I got the Chimichurri Chicken Sandwich.  Rodney gave us a story about the sandwich being too spicy for a past patron as a warning. LOL. Dude... That was not spicy at all. I kept biting into my first half of the sandwich looking for spice! It was still pretty good though. I love the fresh avocado with it. I had more avocado mouse/sauce on the side, but I honestly liked the Aioli sauce my sister got. Liked dipping my fries into that. My sister also enjoyed her chicken with the Thai chili sauce. Sad to say we couldn't finish it all, but we were just being polite and saving leftovers for our dad. LOL. He wasn't too happy that we went on a sibling date without him.  Anyway, food alone, this place gets 4 stars for flavor and variety of dishes. Giving it 5 for the outstanding customer service provided by Rodney.  Noticed that he was the only server on the floor. The impressive thing was that even though he seemed to have to take care of the entire restaurant, the indoors and the patio, he still managed to check up on us several times. If anyone can make my sister smile and relax as a first time patron, I can seriously appreciate that. Seriously... Thanks to him, my sister's mood got a little better, considering she didn't even want to go to Downtown for a meal.  I hope the tip was adequate enough to show my gratitude. If not, I'll be sure to make up for it on our next visit. LOL. So long as the experience is equivalent or exceeds our expectations once again.",

Added bacon, asparagus, and Swiss cheese. My husband had his with steak and he said it was quite good. Sure looked good! Will go back. The omelettes didn't come with potatoes or toast but I'm a low carb eater and was still full without finishing the entire omelette.",

One of us has the salmon - better than the salmon had a previous night at some fancy steakhouse at the Mirage. Other had the Perch burger - best burger I've had in a long time. Band playing down below us in the park while we ate. Half the cost of meals on the strip, and better.  Atmosphere is top notch. Great friendly, attentive service. We will be back!",

The bartender/ server was great and I would recommend a visit if you are in the area. It's about a 5-10 min walk from Fremont Experience.

    "text": "When we arrived it wasn't busy at all, there were two of us and we opted to sit outside since it was a nice day.  We asked if we could have a bigger table (so we wouldn't feel cramped since the two person table is SMALL) and we were advised we either sit at the bar or a smaller table or basically LEAVE. Nonetheless we sit outside at a two person table (we had to seat ourselves) and as we were sitting down a waitress moved the place settings to set at a table behind us and then proceeds to say \"did they tell you to sit there\", so obviously someone advised us to sit there, after that we had to wait for someone to bring us place settings and then one side was dirty (from prior use) and the waiter just flips it over.  At this point were still like lets give them the benefit of doubt.  We order drinks (beer and a Moscow mule) we asked if they chilled the beer glasses and the waitress go ticked we asked that, furthermore, the drinks come out and the mule is in a plastic cup (gasp) which is rather sacrilegious for a Moscow mule.  We finally ordered our food (calamari and chicken sandwich)  and 30 minutes later after advising the waitress we haven't received our food (and several tables that sat after us and ordered the same thing had received the food 10 min prior) finally the calamari comes out and once again we had to inform the waitress our other entree hasn't come out so nevertheless after 35 min we receive a froze chicken patty that is cold (I mean really what happened to fresh breaded chicken breast), we advised the waitress about the cold chicken and she asked if I would like for her to warm it up in the microwave (GASSSSSSSSP) um no! Ordered another mule and asked for the copper mug (it tastes better in the copper mug) and at this time the bartender comes out to smooth things over and we were advised that the dishwasher was broken that's why it was in a plastic cup.  To make a long story short the best thing was the fry's and after that experience we will never be back however, we are downtown 3-4x a month at Carson's Kitchen and it is the bestest (yes I said BESTEST) their customer service is always on point, the food is always DELICIOUS and the drinks are absolutely SUPERB!!!!!!",

We had the beet carpaccio, the grilled corn and shrimp salad (I think it might've been called the \"Terrace\"), the steak sandwich, and the french fries. The sandwich was delicious, as was the salad. The carpaccio beets were great quality, but served raw, which I didn't love - would've been better if they had been allowed to marinate in the vinaigrette for a little while. Great idea, though, something I would potentially make and serve. The fries were great quality and perfectly cooked. They seemed to be cooked in some kind of animal fat, likely pork. I prefer vegetable oil for fries, but my dining companions seemed to enjoy them very much. My dad had a salad called \"The egg\", which came with a poached egg and thick-cut bacon. He seemed to enjoy it. I stole a few pieces of bacon, which was tasty.  All in all, tasty food, warm and respectful service, and fun setting. I recommend The Perch!",

When we checked in with the host they said it was about 45 min to and hr wait which we understood since it was Valentine's Day. They put our name and number to contact us when it's our turn. An hr passed and we went to check on the status and they said they tables are not ready yet. We decided to wait near the restaurant we saw a few tables that had no one sitting there and they didn't seat anyone there for a while.

I ordered a mojito which arrived 20 minutes later. Our food never got to our table because an hour after we ordered the food was not ready. the waiter never asked how we were doing (waiting in the cold, HUNGRY..is not fun) The server decided to humiliate us by giving us a cold sandwich that was left over from who knows who as if we were there to beg for food, important to emphasize that there were few customers and many people in the kitchen visible from outside, who knows what they were doing.. obviously not cooking.",

The service was excellent, the setting on a balmy afternoon into evening (with doors open) was very relaxed and comfortable, and the food was excellent.   I will be back and will encourage my local and visiting friends to do the same! Three of us shared the olive tampanade and fresh mozzarella starters...simple and delicious.   I had the salmon served over brussel sprouts and asparagus...perfectly cooked to my requested 'done' temperature, very fresh, and very tasty...although the sauce... which I had had on the side...has a kick to it!   My guests enjoyed their entrees, not a scrap left on the plates...again a testimony to perfect portion sizes.    The two deserts we 'shared' were scrumptious...the poached pears in a ricotta 'pudding' tasted amazing, but I snarfed down the hazelnut flourless chocolate torte with fresh whipped cream...  I am looking forward to the next time I get over to that side of town!  Go.  you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "The Perch is a little restaurant located in Container Park in Downtown Las Vegas. It's on the second level of the park in the southwest corner of the park. It's accessible either by stairs or elevator. I visited the Perch for the first time during the evening on the weekend with a party of three.  Atmosphere: Hip, bright, and new! Being merely seated in the Perch, either outside or inside, is a great experience, in my personal opinion. The combination of the bright lights from the evening outdoors and the colorful backdrop of the pink-and-yellow-lit bar display created a fun and enjoyable atmosphere. I think it was very clever that the napkin \"holder\" also doubled as a fold-out menu, so the Perch gets bonus points for creativity.  Service: Stellar! The waiter we had this evening was very nice to us. One of my patrons wanted to retake a picture that the waiter had taken of us and our waiter kindly did so.  Food: Great!  The margherita pizza was light yet delicious. A friend of mine had the chipotle burger and it looked pretty appetizing from where I was sitting. It all was served within a reasonable time of ordering the food.  Overall: Come visit! This is a very cool, up-to-date place that has a great environment and staff. Worth a visit for the experience on the second floor of Container Park.",

For starters there are no servers, only bartenders, and what seems to be food runners.   As soon as we arrived we waited about 5-10 minutes before an employee acknowledged our party, and then seated us once they found an open area (since they do get busy for brunch.) Once we were sat down we reviewed the menu, and waited about 10 minutes before stopping the gentlemen that seated us, and he mentioned there were no servers - we must order with the bartender, and then the food will be delivered to us. It was a party of 8, and we all got unlimited mimosas so it was a bit annoying that we had to get up, and request another drink every single time. Especially since it's busy, and the bar gets full quickly. Therefore, you have to wait till a bartender becomes available.   This now seems like a fast food place, but with a bar, better food, and good customer service.",

The food they ordered was pretty tasty, I would say the same about mine but IT NEVER CAME.  We inquired TWICE about the food I ordered, to which we were told they would \"check\" and never got back to us.  In total we waited around 30 minutes AFTER the first two dishes arrived. We all ordered at the same time, so there was no reason to be such a delay.  Overall the entire meal was free due to the fact that they completely forgot to feed my person at the table.  Probably won't be back here just because the service was so bad. Worst experience I've had in a long time.",

I personally had the bottomless bloody Mary's and the shortrib country hash with a side of bacon.   The bloody Mary's are nice and spicy, and were definitely not lacking in alcohol. Our server was really friendly. He has on French fry socks and for some reason was holding onto a few children's books. He was very entertaining and made sure we were well taken care of.  The shortrib hash was really good. It has sauteed mushrooms, peppers, the short rib and nice crispy potatoes. I ordered a side of bacon and it was thick and crispy. Which to me makes perfect bacon.  However. My absolute favorite thing here is the monkey bread. By far the best monkey bread I have ever had and everyone should order it. You would definitely not regret it.   There is a lot of parking near this location, but it is all paid parking, so be aware that it will cost $3-6 depending on how long you eat and want to shop around   Happy eating!",

I am def a yelper, so I had figured out what I wanted about two weeks before arriving. We were sat down wherever we wanted, and a server came over for our drink order. We were catching a movie downtown, so we opted for water since we were driving. I was excited to see the menu, but to my surprise a few items are not on the menu any longer. :(   I am never craving a burger but the Oz burger sounded really good, especially the pineapple aspect. It was sweet and savory at the same time.  But I will say the Oz burger is delicious! I was a fan of the fries as well, and the bun looked awesome nicely . My only compliant is there was a few items on the burger that were not listed on the description of the burger. (Asked the server if it had cheese and she said yes, I said no cheese. Burger came out with no cheese but with tomato) I feel like if you're going to list what's in it to make sure you list it all.   But besides that the food was good the service was good everyone was nice and we will be back for brunch!",

Salmon was outstanding. Served on a bed of deep fried then pan roasted Brussel sprouts with beans. Salmon done perfectly at a medium with a crispy skin.

The bottomless cocktails at brunch are nice as well. Now on to the cons. First off, our server's body language told us she wasn't smitten with us. Was it the questions we were asking, that weren't clarified on the menu, or the fact that we had four children with us, two of which were toddlers? We will never really know. Maybe she was just having a stressful day. Either way, we had to reach out to other staff as well as walk to the bar to get refills on our Drinks. I don't even recall being asked if everything was good or if we needed anything else after our food was dropped off. She did, however, ask us right up front if we wanted separate checks, so that was a positive. Therefore, the service was so so. On top of that, the scrambled eggs on two separate orders were so over cooked they were brown. I think that was a bad call to send those out rather than remake them.",

We asked the waiter what the most popular dishes were and ordered two to share.   Chicken and Waffle - This was some of the crunchiest chicken I have ever encountered, which I appreciate. It had decent flavor and was very juicy. The dish comes already covered in maple syrup (although I asked for extra in advance) and dusted with powdered sugar. I love the taste to sweet chicken!!   Steak & Egg Tacos - these are certainly tiny considering the price. But they were delicious! The salsa really carried the flavor and the steak was tender and not overly chewy.   This place really did have awesome, friendly service. I'm sure we'll return soon!",

I check back after an hour and the lady up front told me there is still no seats, but I look at the list and there seems to be people party of 4, 5, and 3 seated already. I asked the lady how long would it be more for the wait, and she tells me she can't give me a time because there's no seats available yet. I give it 30 minute more of a wait, and still my party of 9 we're not seated. We waited about an hour and 40 minutes so we just decided to eat at another place in the container park, and I thought they would still call my phone number, but the whole time I was in the park, I did not receive a single phone call about getting my party to be seated. Please fix this problem so maybe people can enjoy their day better instead of waiting so long for nothing!!! They don't accept reservations either! What a joke!",

Smothered biscuits with Turkey Sausage When we arrived we were told the fryer had broken and that option 1 was no longer available, and option 3 actually contained pork sausage. There were no other options for people who did not eat beef or pork.   The management was unwilling to compromise and offer reasonable alternatives. Additionally, he was condescending and tried to blame the our event organizer for choosing a pre-fixed menu. It is not our event organizers fault that the fryer broke, and it was not their fault that management was inflexible.  I will note that our servers (Shawn and Jessica) were very nice. I cannot speak to the quality of the food (because I did not eat any). However, if you are thinking of having any sort of large group event here... DON'T!",

I like that they have veg options so I don't have to majorly modify anything just to order. Today I had the power greens salad. It was really good. The dressing was really salty, but I like salty so I loved it. My meat eating friend ordered the veggie burger and said it was delicious. I had some of her fries and they were so-so...tasted like run of the mill, from a bag, previously frozen fries.  We got the free wine when we checked in. It was ok...not great but also not awful.  So here's my issue w this place...the staff is just rude. Last time I was there we came at night and missed the \"wait to be seated\" sign. We sat ourselves on the balcony. The waiter came over, told us the table wasn't clean/ready, and then told us they saved that particular table because of the view. Basically we weren't good enough to sit there. We left.   This time the bartender offered us a high top or the bar and then basically told us we couldn't have a table because they were saved for parties of 3 or more. Our party of 2 sat at the bar. Later we saw 2 guys get seated at a 4 top table. Whoopsie  Overall this place has a lot of potential and the food is decent, but the staff has a tendency to act like snobs for no particular reason.",

It took forever to get our food, just as long to get refills on our water, and an eternity to get our check (only after requesting for it more than once). I can't even recall who our server was, as he never introduced himself and never returned after taking our order. Our water, alcoholic beverages, food, and check were all brought to us by different employees. I'm not sure if that's the system they choose to operate on, but I will say it definitely wasn't efficient. For such a small establishment, things should have run much smoother. Regardless of whether or not they had a table of 10 seated, who seemed to be taking up everyone's attention. Oh, and as for the food...it was just alright. The calamari was tasty, but saturated in grease, as if the oil it was fried in wasn't hot enough. The terrace salad, while tasty, was lacking everywhere else...with 4 small shrimp, a handful of corn, a few spoons of avocado, and a couple split tomatoes, $15, I think not. And, my daughter's chicken tenders were practically burnt! All in all, with the service lagging and the food being nothing special, I don't see us returning anytime soon.",

I have found my new contemporary go-to spot to have drinks and food while in CPDT.   The atmosphere was very pretty. The space is tight, but the way they positioned the tables made it feel open and airy. The deco was inviting and comfortable while still being stylish.   The staff was WONDERFUL and genuinely sweet! Loved them all!  The great service was the reason we didn't complain about the few gripes we had about our food. Excellent service!  The food: I had the Angel hair pasta and it was delicious! The only grip I have was that the pasta was slightly dry (possibly from sitting out in open air for too long?). I expected it to be moist or have a little more oil to keep the pasta from sticking together. The flavor was very good, especially with the almonds and currants. It gave it a smokey and sweet flavor that I LOVED! I will be having this dish again! As long as the pasta is not dry ;)  My friend's dish: She ordered the grilled salmon and OMFG!!! IT WAS AMAZING! I was so jealous! The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned! So freaking good!! It was a perfect pairing with the asparagus and brussels spouts on the bottom (and I'm not even a fan of brussels sprouts). It was heavenly!! But of course there was one problem (other than the small portion size): The avocado sauce on top of the salmon was OVERSALTED! I'm talking the make your glands explode type of salty. It was disappointing, but thankfully the dish was still so AMAZING that it wasn't a big deal. She still wolfed it down. She basically CLEANED the bowl!  The portion size was great for the price (except the salmon dish) and we walked away with full bellies. I would definitely come back very soon and recommend to anyone!   **I can't review the drinks because we already had drinks from their sister bar, Oak&Ivy (MY FAVORITE BAR IN CPDT!!). It was already late anyway and we didn't want to drink again. We also didn't get dessert because nothing stood out, but I'll give it a try next time**",

You can definitely grab your food to go and hang out downtstairs with kids or if the day permits it enjoy your food out and about. I definitely used the outdoor seats while I waited for my goodies. I like that they had infused water ready for anyone to grab. With the summer approaching that is a definite plus. I also noticed that they had a very extensive drink selection and the knowledge to recommend and prepare a delicious drink or pour you a nice glass of beer. Let's move onto the food I didn't really order as much as I would like. Good thing I came with my friend, and we were able to order two items to try. The first thing that caught our eye was the waffle and chicken. It's not your typical chicken and waffle they actually amped it up with fruits!  I wasn't too sure if it would work and boy was I wrong! They paired very well and definitely had a burst of flavor, I loved the strawberries and apples with the caramel sauce and raspberry drizzle.  My meal was so good, and it was definitely enough to share since we ordered the edamame, it was so seasoned and good perfectly. I definitely couldn't stop. Hence my poor attempts of finishing my meal. This place has definitely got some good dishes and the staff is super friendly. I simply have no complaints.",

My friends are dog-parents (if you're a pet owner, you'd understand) so I called the restaurant to make sure it was pet friendly. I called the number directly from yelp and spoke to a woman named Courtney. I asked if he restaurant was pet friendly and if we can sit on the porch and she said yes it was, dogs were allowed. So my friends and I made the trek down (1 hour drive), only to be told that DOGS were not allowed. The restaurant staff said it was service animals only and had to leave.   The woman should have been more specific and said service dogs only. Staff need to be more informative to their customers.  But thanks to 7th and Carson right across the street, they were more and willing to accommodate us and their food was very delicious! I will be  UPDATED REVIEW 4/1/18  I was contacted privately by David who sincerely apologized and invited me back to the restaurant.  I dined in with my sister and nephew on 3/31 and got top notch hospitality. Brandon and the staff were very friendly and recommended a lot of great items!   It was a perfect day! Warm weather, clear skies, live music and our Moscow mules were AMAZING!!! (FYI-get the Jameson, raspberry and rosemary mule!)   And I can't forget about the food! We ordered the Calamari, the Bianca flatbread, The Oz, and the juiciest turkey burger I have ever had!   We wanted to try more but we were so filled!   We will definitely be back again and for Brunch!   Thank you Brandon and David for a wonderful and filling dinner!",

Also don't forget to check in to receive a complimentary glass of wine or beer of your choice. This hipster cafe is located inside Container Park, but beware parking can be hard to find and you have to pay for meters.  I'm a very simple brunch person, I usually like to order omelets or the typical two eggs, bacon, and toast. I didn't see anything I really wanted in their brunch menu, but the children's section I wanted a cheese omelet and their egg and bacon. I asked the server, if I could order from there and he was very lenient and chill about it. (Usually you have to be under 12 for that section!) Even though the food portions look extremely small, it is super filling! I can't wait to try the steak and egg tacos next!",

The building is literally a container so the noise level was insane. I could barely hear my boyfriend who was sitting right next to me. I will say they had some rowdy brunchers in the restaurant but once they left the noise level was much more tolerable.  We did not have a reservation and waited about 15 minutes for a table.  Bottomless mimosas are available for $15 with a two hour limit. What I do like is they bring you a bottle a champagne and a carafe of orange juice to your table. You pour your own mimosas and they bring you more when you are done.  For my meal I had the chicken and waffles. It was the first time I had chicken with the bone served for this dish. The chicken was absolutely delicious.  The views from the restaurant were nice and the waitstaff were very friendly.",

    "text": "So I've been to Downtown Terrace a handful of times before but none of the times previously stood out like this occasion I went. So I have to take the time to write this Yelp review. My boyfriend and I walked in, sat down, ordered the standard drip coffee and after pondering and pondering I finally decided to split the crab eggs benedict with Chipotle hollandaise sauce. Upon the eggs benedict arriving to the table I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into it. So as I took the first crack at the poached eggs I was not impressed. The poached eggs were clearly overcooked. Chef Araceli happened to be in the dining room  and I expressed to her that my poached eggs were overcooked. She immediately went into the kitchen to ensure I would have proper poached eggs for my eggs benedict. After moments in the kitchen she came out with fresh poached eggs. This level of service is why I would come back to Downtown Terrace and also refer my friends to come back as well. She was very attentive and I appreciate that level of service.",

I ordered chilaquiles and they did not put any sauce on it. If anyone knows chilaquiles half the reason to get them is because of the sauce.

(Interesting challenge but hey, I'm the frickin' Mayor!!! I got this!) So, while heading to check out another restaurant we stumbled upon the Downtown Terrace, mainly because the sandwich board downstairs mentioned a $16 Bottomless Margarita. Um...yes please! So, we changed our course and ventured upstairs.  Now, although this place was not at all fancy, it was clean, had a great view of the Container Park stage, and their drinks were SLAMMIN'!!!  They even boasted something I had not seen before: Build Your Own margarita, and the waitress, Courtney, muddeled the shit out of our fruit filled drinks. So good.  The food that I had there wasn't bad, not incredible but not bad at all. The place was more of a snack food/comfort food kind of vibe but the drink part of this establishment was on point.  I'm gonna go back to this place but I'm going to first make sure that I'm not driving...",

They have a few \"bottomless\" drink specials- mimosas and bloodys for $15 during brunch and \"all you can drink\" house wines (can't quite remember the exact days). The indoor space is very small and as a result a bit on the noisy side when it's full but they also have outdoor seating overlooking the playground.   The Chicken and Waffles were wonderful and the monkey bread had a great nostalgic flavor and texture. Some of the other brunch offerings included steak and egg tacos, brioche French toast, short rib hash, berry crepes, salads, the \"Perch burger\" with a fried green tomato and more.   I would definitely recommend this place to locals and visitors alike for an affordable and quick breakfast/brunch in the downtown area.",

    "text": "We stopped by for dinner on a Saturday evening around 7pm. The restaurant itself looks and feels quite unique and nice being that it's in the Downtown Container Park.   Upon walking in. the two of us were given the choice of sitting at a two-seat table by the door. It was chilly out, so I didn't feel like sitting right by the door. I asked if we could sit at a four-seat table further in away from the door of the restaurant. This, for some reason, prompted a vigorous discussion between the gentleman seating us and another fellow behind the bar. We ended being offered and accepting a high table (for two).   This odd behavior irked me. The table for four I had asked about sitting at ended up being empty for the entirety of our meal. If a table a customer asks to sit at isn't actually reserved for an incoming party, good customer service is to GIVE THEM THAT TABLE.   If not for the misguided attempt to keep a table open for other possible customers, our experience at The Perch would have been very good. Our server was very friendly and the Grilled Salmon and Chicken Quinoa we ordered were quite well-prepared.  The price bracket their food is at requires their service to be on point. But it's not all there. You'll very likely enjoy some tasty food, but be prepared for awkward service, dirty tables and casual lackadaisical employees chatting and pointless hanging about behind the bar.",

My friend Jessie and I came to eat here one Sunday morning for brunch. We started with cocktails. I had the peach bellini and Jessie had the Bloody Mary. They do have a bottomless option for around $15 (your choice of bloody/mimosa/bellini), but we didn't want to get too buzzed so we just got single drinks. As soon as her drink came out, I was instantly jealous! The Bloody Mary is deconstructed and it comes with an almost full glass of premium vodka, a cup of tomato juice, and then sides of horseradish/tabasco, lemons and olives. You can make it how you like it. Sooo cool! My bellini was good, but I am totally getting the bloody next time.   So the food. I originally wanted breakfast, but the Perch Burger sounded really good so I went with that. The burger had provolone cheese, bacon, a fried green tomato, and chipotle mayo. It also came with fries and a side of chipotle mayo. The burger was pretty damn good and I am happy I chose that. The fries were perfectly cooked, but could have used some salt. I enjoyed dipping them in the chipotle mayo though. For 2 drinks and 2 meals, the total was $50 not including tip. I did enjoy my meal, but I think $50 is a little too much for brunch.",

Like an outdoor living room, Perch is low key and welcoming.   I can't comment on food, but they made a solid French 75 for me during Life Is Beautiful.

The service was great! I forgot our servers name but he did an amazing job. He filled our waters and honored our Yelp check ins.  The food was delicious. The salmon&asparagus was cooked to perfection, my chicken fingers & fries were bomb, and the tuna tartar was perfect! Our drinks however were disgusting... We ordered the green tea martinis which was literally watered down lemon lime juice with rubbing alcohol in it. Their beers on tap however are amazing, and their wine!   The prices were standard hipster food... Very reasonable. Will be back :)",

Def disappointed with the monkey bread it was so dry seems like yesterday's bread that got heated up and drench with caramel sauce. So unappetizing, lack of presentation. Our food was ok. I had the shrimps and grits again drench in sauce and my bf had the chicken and waffles chicken was way over cooked also drench in syrup to a point that the waffles are all soggy. Wouldn't come back here unless we are doing the bottomless mimosas where they give u a whole bottle of champagne so they don't keep coming back and bothering u, Only good thing about it beside the view. Otherwise not worth the trip.",

    "text": "Located upstairs, in the back corner of the Container Park, The Perch really makes the most of what they've got. The dining room is open, bright, and very comfortable, with the bar being the main star of the space. My partner and I were greeted quickly when we walked in. The gentleman gave us the choice of two awkward tables in the dining room (well, one was in the entryway of the restaurant, and the other was an awkward high top in the middle of the dining room), so we opted to go outside. Not sure if they were understaffed, or if we caught the tail-end of a massive dinner rush, but every open table was dirty, and most not even pre-bussed. It took him about 5 minutes to clean our table (we were, however, greeted by every employee while we waited), and I must admit, it was worth it. The evening was beautiful last night, and the singer on the main stage of the Container Park was very talented, which really help compliment the evening for us, since we were celebrating a new job that I just landed.  Our server, Alexis, was very friendly and accommodating. She was obviously busy, but she made it a point to come chat it up with us on a few occasions. It turns out that my partner and I know her sister's boyfriend - Vegas is really a small town, when you get down to it.  How often do you have organic, pleasant conversations with your server, and figure things out like that? My partner has a tomato allergy, so she was able to come up with substitution ideas on the fly, and they were spot-on! We started with the Bianca Flatbread, and added the prosciutto, of course. I love it when they print the up charge on the menu so there isn't a question of what you're getting yourself into. The Flatbread was delicious, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, the toppings were generous and the sauce was delicious.  I used my Yelp Check-In and got a small glass of the 1664 Blanc. I've had 1664 before, but never the Blanc. I was living for this beer! I really enjoyed the peach notes, and how smooth it was. I had to get a pint.  I had the Hanger Steak Sandwich for my main course. It was cooked to a perfect medium, like I asked, and the caramelized onions were on point. The mayo was a bit overpowering, and the bread a little too tough, but it was still very enjoyable. The fries were great. My partner gave the fries a 6 out of 10, but I say they were more of an 8. Lol They were crispy on the edges, but still soft inside. The seasoning and truffle oil really set them off.   This was a great first impression, and can't wait to try them out again. I had my eyes on the Chicken and Waffles...",

    "text": "Bookmarked this spot ages ago, and finally made it in for a Yelp event. Tried a few apps and drinks, then came back for lunch a few days later. The drinks trend on the light and fruity side, and the foods are fresh with several healthy options available. Good spot for brunch or a girls night out.   BEEF CARPACCIO ($14): thin sliced raw beef with parm-reg, balsamic glaze, and arugula. The regular portion is fairly large, fitting for the price. Really enjoyed this app. SPICY SHRIMP PASTA ($16): Shrimp, tomato, arugula, and pasta in a Sriracha cream sauce that wasn't nearly spicy enough, IMO. I rarely eat pasta, but this was a fun mix of lighter ingredients that kept the dish from being too heavy. The sliced grilled bread added some much needed crunch. CHIMICHURRI CHICKEN SANDWICH ($13): Large portion of thin-pounded chicken cutlets on a soft baguette style roll. Cheese received on sandwich did not appear to be queso fresco as stated on menu, and I didn't taste or see the avocado mousse. Chimichurri sauce was thick and chunky but seemed to be missing something in the flavor. Not sure why there were a ton of red pepper flakes on this. HAND CUT FRIES ($6): These were soggy and limp mere minutes after ordering, but they were skin-on with sea salt, so they were more flavorful than expected. The garlic aioli was delicious, couldn't stop dipping! Can't imagine how much better these would be if the fries were actually crispy.  I'm not a huge fan of the Container Park, but I really like this restaurant's upstairs location and glass windows, which make it light and airy. The bird motif throughout is a cute decorative touch, and the bright colors and warm staff are welcoming.   TIP: they have a downstairs gate entrance to get straight inside rather than wandering through the whole CP area! Brunch has bottomless drink options and there's also a weekday HH offered 4-6PM.",

I'm really glad we discovered the place because everything about it was incredible. The food, location, and service were all on point.   Located on the second floor of Container Park, we had a great view of the lawn below where all of the families were watching their kids play with the blocks.  We asked our awesome server, Nora, what she recommended on the menu and she told us about the Breakfast Steak Tacos, Bananas Foster French Toast, and Smothered Egg Biscuits. We ordered one of each and did not regret that decision. The latter of which was my order and I devoured it in record time. It was almost too good! The homemade gravy was out of this universe. We all sampled each other's dishes and we couldn't get over how delicious everything was.  For dessert, we ordered the Monkey Bread. Again, phenomenal. Nora even put a candle in it because we told her that it was our friend's birthday, so we also sang \"Happy Birthday\" to him.  For drinks, we paid $15 for bottomless Mimosas and Bloody Marys. Definitely well worth it.  I definitely recommend The Perch to brunch fans looking for a relaxing, casual environment with incredible service. I'll definitely be coming back here when I find myself in Vegas again.",

Seemed pretty busy when I went and servers seemed pretty preoccupied with working in general. Although when I needed stuff they were on it.   Once we got our food it made up for the 30 min wait after ordering. Perch Burger is BOMB! Def check this place out as well as Container Park as a whole.",

Monday nite just before 9 pm we enter to a server at the door saying they are only serving drinks, their kitchen is closed.  I responded that on line and on Yelp it listed their hours until 10 pm.  She responded that it is their slow season so they have been closing the kitchen early.  I understand the reason,  but change your hours on Yelp, etc to reflect this if during the slow season you want to close early.  What a disappointment.",

My wife tried one of their signature drinks (Pena Berry Margarita) and it was to salty for her so they made her another drink without a fuss. That's always a plus in my book. Normally she gets her Margarita's without salt. Started with the Fried Calamari, very good. The Jalapeno's were browned which cut down on the heat and the Lemon Aioli was a nice dipping sauce. Bianca Flat bread, this is good enough to be your entree if you looking for something a little lighter than burgers or pasta. Spicy Shrimp Pasta just the right amount of heat, balanced. The Perch Burger. I'm not a guy that likes tomato on my burger but the fried green tomato was a nice touch.  I'd definitely get this again. I always like a good burger with my beer.",

The tuna tartare did not taste fresh; that is my only complaint.  I had the spicy shrimp pasta which was wonderful, creamy and delicious with a very spicy kick.  The steak they placed down at the table next to us looked and smelled even more amazing.  I'll have that is I go back.  All in all great place, it's now called The Perch. What I loved most is that they happily served us even though we came in right before they closed; which is an asshole move you should never make unless you ask in a way that ensures the restaurant knows it is absolutely fine to refuse you service and tell you to take a hike! :)",

I wish I could remember his name as he was fantastic! We had a couple of beers and I had the chicken chimichurri which was to die for! We sat outside on the patio and they even turned in the heaters for us! We thoroughly enjoyed our evening and the service and food was impeccable! My partner I believe had the fried chicken sandwich which I had a bite of and it was yummmy! The couches outside might need a little of TLC abut that was my only negative. This spot is also great when they have performance in the stage in the park because it's patio is on the second floor overlooking the stage! Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!",

When we walked up the stairs there weren't any signs wait to be seated so we walked to a couch area and sat down. We were approached by a guy named Brandon who later said he was the bar manager. To say he was rude is an understatement. He said \"for future reference you DONT seat yourself. Haven't you ever been to a restaurant before\" I apologized and said since their wasn't a sign I assumed it was a seat yourself. He cut me off as I was talking and said \"Well it's not, maybe you shouldn't assume things\" I was totally shocked! We started to get up and he said \"well it's too late to move now\" and he stormed away. The waiters that came by continued to come to our table and tell us how we shouldn't have sat ourselves. By then I was over it but we had already ordered drinks. The drinks were disgusting and I'm not just saying that because Brandon was a jerk. The Bloody Mary was the worst I've ever had.   We will not be going back here. I think Brandon needs to find a job outside of hospitality and not assume because he knows the \"rules\" everyone else does. Put up some damn signs or something.",

Our server, Nora, was super friendly and attentive, and the bartender was also great and even brought us a little plate of fruit to put in our bottomless bellinis!  The food was delicious and was presented beautifully.  The margarita flatbread is to die for!    We really enjoyed the bottomless drinks deal.  As of January 2019, it was $16 for bottomless mimosas/bellinis/wine/bloody Marys with purchase of an entree (or two starters), and there is a two hour limit.  For the mimosas and bellinis, they give you a drink, and then bring out a bottle of champagne and a little jar of juice for you to mix yourself at the table.  It's a great (and dangerous!) way to start your evening!",

The bloody mary is a bit spicy which I love and is sooooo sooooo sooooo good. For lunch we ordered a burger and the quinoa lemon chicken. The food was to die for.

Coming to The Container Park for the first time tonight I wanted to try one of the local eateries and expand my pallet. So after walking the length of the park I settled on The Downtown Terrace. Located on level 2 in the back right by the stage.   With indoor and outdoor seating available to enjoy the live music I was already starting to fall in love with the venue. Inside the resteraunt is small, being 2 containers fused together, very cozy but intimate which was perfect for my date night.  Amazing service right from the start. Waters as soon as you're seated without asking for them, quick service by very knowledgeable staff and amazing cuisine that will make you come back again and again!   We ordered the chicken & waffles and country fried steak. The chicken and waffles were freshly made, sweet yet savory, and cooked to perfection.   The country fried steak was made fresh in house and the best plate of that design I have ever had!! From the first bite to the last it was a picture image of what cooking with love is all about.   Couldn't reccomend this place more. A must try for your life period.",

What we thought would be a quick bite turned into a multi hour ordeal, down to even having to ask for our check 3 times over a 20 minute time period.   Food wasn't bad Service was the worst",

They only offer the full brunch menu on the weekends but they still had a few brunch items including the chilaquiles. I ordered that with shrimp on top, which is not a usual menu item but the waiter was kind enough to add it for me. It was so good, I'm definitely happy with my choice. My favorite thing about this place is that they off $16 bottomless mimosas and bellinis (along with bloody marys or wine) everyday! The waiter was amazing and very attentive. I will be going back soon.",

    "text": "So happy that we ended up finding this place after searching for an open restaurant on a Wednesday night! Located in Container Park, on the second floor, Downtown Terrace was a good place to stop away from the business of Fremont Street. We were seated and served right away. I ordered ceviche as my main meal which came with a bunch of fresh chips and shrimp, jalapeno, tomato and onion. The dish was very reasonably priced, fresh and tasty. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating, overlooking the stage in the park; I imagine it must be a fun place when there are performers.  Although I didn't partake, the restaurant had bottomless red and white wine for $16 dollars (definitely worth it if you plan on having more than 2 glasses).  Would definitely return to try the tuna tartare or beef carpaccio.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I cannot rate the food because due to the the lack of customer service, my party and I canceled our food order and opted to go to another restaurant. We went on Saturday afternoon (December 15, 2018) for brunch to celebrate my birthday. Right off the bat, we noticed the waitress was not the most friendliest person. That aside, we continued to not let her attitude affect our brunch. It wasn't until my daughter asked for clarification about an item on the menu, she replied hastily, saying the food item is what the menu says it is, she didn't try to provide any other explanation. Again, not what she said, but the tone in which she said it; we felt as if we were bothering her. After ordering our food, we decided we were not going to patronize a restaurant that treated its customers in this manner. I walked over to the waitress and informed her that we wanted to cancel our order and pay for the drink that had already been received. She asked why were we canceling our order and I told her due to the lack of professionalism and her attitude. I further explained to her the way in which she answered the question about the menu item was down-right rude. I let her know that when customers have questions about menu items, most servers can answer the question, in more detail, and not respond by saying it is what the menu says it is. She provided an apology, however, it was more of the same tone and attitude she had been displaying. She said she was sorry they didn't have the bread I wanted (I wanted wheat they only served white), again in a hastily manner. Clearly, our choice to leave had nothing to do with the lack of wheat bread, but everything to do with the lack of customer service and the bad attitude she was throwing our way. My suggestion is to provide staff with customer service training because if this waitress treats everyone the way we were treated, it's only a matter of time before no one patronize this establishment.",

The bartender was incredibly patient with my indecisiveness and let me take my time while maintaining good conversation with me and the other two patrons present. I'm a sucker for good customer service, which I get the most of in DTLV. Ordered a light draft, the Margherita flatbread & a SmartWater. Delicious food, although there was slightly too much sauce on the flatbread. The atmosphere more than made up for that very minor flaw. And the beer (can't remember the name, but it's light with \"1776\" in the title) was a hit as well. I can't wait to come back. They're doing pretty much everything right!",

    "text": "Best spicy salad ever (The Terrace). At first you can smell the bbq'd shrimp (cooked on charcoal??) and then you notice all the corn and that it also has been grilled. At the bottom of the spicy bowl, which is spicy but not over powering enough to need a milky drink, you find tomato slices to create a base and compliment the cherry tomatoes used primarily in the salad. Also had the new shrimp appetizer which was equally mouthwatering with a creamy dip.   Even the house red which is normally suppose to be even keeled and easy to drink had lots going on. I am glad it did to help with all the tastebuds being kicked in from the salad. Great work and a fun place to hang out for the night.",

    "text": "Experience: Loved! A group of friends met to try this spot out. There were 8 of us ladies, and we sat outside for dinner.   Facility:  this restaurant is located in Container Park, so it's definitely small. It's in the back, close the stage, above the toy store. We sat outside on the patio, because it was an amazing night.  For those of you who get cold easily, they have heaters outside to keep the chill off.   Service: our waiter was Daniel, and he was awesome. He was patient, attentive and added a splash of humor without going over the top. The only part that I didn't like is when he brought the checks out when he thought we were done. This tends to signal the end of the night for some people, and they left after they paid. Just would have preferred him to wait until we asked for the check. Other than that...he was great!  Food:  I ordered the Brainless Raspberries beer on tap, which was pretty good. Not a fan of any sweet drinks, and this just had a hint of raspberries, not an overpowering taste of it.  A friend and I split a burger and flatbread, so we could taste both. So glad we did, because both were delicious!   Mine was the Burger and fries with Chipotle aioli. The burger was so good.  It had a fried green tomato on top too!  The aioli was perfect to dip the fries in with just the right amount of spicy.  Flatbread Bianca was really tasty. It had white cheeses with arugula and prosciutto on top. Crust was perfect too! A few ladies ordered the Salmon and roasted veggies, and it looked so good. I will get that next time.    Overall: Great service...great atmosphere...great food!  Definitely will be back. So far my favorite restaurant downtown.",

    "text": "Stopped by for dinner last night before heading to the FSE to see a Joan Jett concert.  I've tried to eat here before but the first time I showed up for a (late) lunch with a few family members, they were having a private event so it was a no go. We're locals so I knew I'd give it another shot since I really like the vibe of container park and knew I'd be back.  When we arrived, a very polite young lady promptly approached us and greeted us. We asked to sit on the patio and she let us pick our table. \"Reserved just for us\" she said....lol She left and then came back with menus,place mats and utensils and let us know someone would be with us shortly. There seemed to be a little confusion as to who our server would be so we sat waiting for a LITTLE bit longer than I think \"usual\". Once they figured out who, our server was Daniel, (cool mustache dude!) he was friendly and helpful to all our questions.  We started with an appetizer of fried calamari. It had bits of lightly breaded and fried jalapenos and lemon slices served with aioli. It was very tasty. The fried lemon slices were a delicious touch!  Next, our entrees:  I had the grilled salmon on a bed of roasted cut asparagus and Brussels sprouts topped with salsa cruda (it was actually an avocado mash) the vegetables were roasted to absolute perfection! Its the ONLY way to eat Brussels in my opinion.     My husband had the Hanger Steak and carmelized onion sandwich which he said was excellent. At the end of our meal, there was an awkward snafu with our check getting mixed up with another guest but Daniel  apologized sincerely and provided us with an itemized printout of our check which just so happened to be the exact dollar amount of another couple who had just dined there. He was totally honest and up front about it, which we appreciated. Not a huge issue, as long as its the correct amount.  Certainly not worth ruining an over all great dining experience or losing a star.  The GM Ryan, also approached us and asked about our food and service. He provided a short survey which I filled out. They did a fine job. I look forward to going back with friends and family sometime. Perhaps a weekend brunch sometime or \"lunch with the girls\".  The portions were big and it was cooked perfectly the way we like it. Kudos to the chefs ! The food prices were VERY fair and the quality of the food was great which will keep us coming back.",

After dinner downtown, my bestie and I decided we wanted just one more drink before we headed home.  We had heard good things from friends about Perch and went for it!    Without even trying their food, I already fell in love with this place.  We walked in and sat at the bar.  The bartender was SO friendly and made our whole experience wonderful!  I decided to go out on a limb and try their Caiparinha.  Now, it is hard to impress me when making one of these because I've spent some time in Brazil and know exactly how one of these should taste Brazilian style.  Well, I was not disappointed!  The drink was pretty authentic and impressive.    I can't wait to go back and try their food, especially their brunch!  Great spot downtown in Container Park!  Can't wait to update this review when I go back!",

    "text": "Downtown Terrace is formally know as The Perch.  Nothing has changed here except for the restaurant name.  Downtown Terrace is located at the back half on the second floor of the Container Park Downtown.  I absolutely love this place for my boozy brunches on the weekend.  This establishment is very casual and relaxed.  When you order the bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary's (as I usually do) the waiters continue to have your glass on full.  I mean really, who doesn't enjoy bottomless mimosas, bloody marys, and bellinis when you're in vegas. You pay $15 to enjoy all these drinks for two hours.   During my dinning experience here, I always order the Monkey break as a table appetizer, and then the chicken and waffles as my meal.  However, during this visit I opted for the Brisket and Potatoes.  The monkey bread is to die for, between the cinnamon sugar flavoring and the melted butter, one could never go wrong with this appetizer.  Next, the chicken in waffles are great.  The chicken is cooked almost to perfection and the waffle is the size of a belgium waffle, that is light and fluffy.  In regards to the Brisket and Potatoes, it contained a nice layer of sauce and nicely cooked potatoes.  The food was not rich nor salty at all.  I give this place a two thumbs up!  Also don't forget to check in to receive a complimentary glass of wine or beer of your choice.",

Okay, we are finally sitting at a table outside. The waiter was fantastic. We went for Sunday brunch and we started with the bacon flight and monkey bread. Fantastic! My wife had the Smothered Egg Biscuits and I had the Brioche French Toast. Incredible!! We also had some strange, devious and incredibly sneaky flight of shots that tasted like different breakfast tastes. I cannot find it on the web site. It is a shame because that was incredible. I was really ticked after waiting, then losing our spot but the food and the wait staff more than made up for it. It was such a treat. KUDOS for taking a potentially shit show and turn it into an incredible, experience.",

Tomato Bisque: It must've been over 105 degrees outside during my visit, but this bowl of soup sounded too good to pass up. It's rich and flavorful, and it packs a bit of heat, but not enough to break a sweat.   The Terrace: Love corn? This is your jam. I wasn't expecting a whole bowl of grilled corn! The salad was topped with grilled shrimp, tomatoes, chimichurri, and avocado slices. I would've preferred more avocado. Otherwise, this was tasty.    Lemon Cheesecake:  This has to be one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had. It's a no-bake cake that had a refreshing lemon flavor. The graham cracker crust was solid. From what I've been told, the chef likes to mix things up when it comes to desserts, so daily offerings are always changing. However, I'd probably order this again and again if it were available.   I may have to return to try their burgers and sandwiches, but it'll be difficult not to order the tomato bisque and lemon cheesecake.",

We order bottomless mimosas and were not aware there was a limit as other times we have been there longer, when we asked for another bottle we were given small to-go plastic cups with mimosas. When I asked if we could continue ordering food and mimosas, we were told no as we have been there the time limit. Our server said that they could serve the food and put it in to go boxes, but we could just not stay there. We asked if we could pay the bottomless mimosa fee again and order food, and again were told \"no\". Let's have in mind that there was not waiting list or clients waiting to be seated. We were willing to get up, go outside, and ask for another table to order mimosas and food, but were told that we could no longer receive the service. Crazy how not even doing a whole show of leaving our table, going outside and asking for another table they allowed us to receive the service again. This is insane and ridiculous!   Some people should obviously not work with customers if they cannot answer in a nice way... No one is asking for free food or drinks, all we wanted was to keep order and enjoy our time there.   Definitely not going back!",

Restaurant and patio looks out at the grassy area where the entertainment area of the park is.   Had lunch here with a party of 4. I had a delicious jalapeno strawberry cocktail with mint salt rim and the tuna tartare as my meal. It was nice and light, good for the price. My boyfriend had the Terrace salad which is shrimp, corn, avocado and cilantro chimichurri. The server recommended it over greens. It was tasty but expensive. $18 for the salad. They charged $3 for the kale they put it over.   Bartender seemed like he made the cocktails with love, handcrafted each one to perfection. Our server was nice and attentive but seemed unfamiliar with the menu at times.   Overall fun experience because of the decor and company. Food is slightly overpriced but I would return.

    "text": "Before this became the Downtown Terrace it was The Perch, while the food is still good the atmosphere has completely changed for the worse. It seems management went into full cost cutting mode and eliminated everything it could from the overhead. No more servers, bussers, hosts or even plates!   If you get bottomless anything you have to fight your way back through the line just to get a refill and with a two hour limit on the bottomless you may only get a couple of glasses before time is up.   Service is obviously non-existent and due to this the line for ordering can become extremely slow.   Bottom line: This place used to be great but then they decided to cut corners, the food is still decent but for the price there are plenty of better brunch options downtown. My advice to management: Don't be so cheap...",

Came in here for bottomless brunch - which is mimosa, Bellini, and Bloody Mary. It was $15 on top of the food you choose. The food I got was about $12. They were really great in serving us. They give you a glass of your choosing at first and then they just ended up giving us bottles instead.  I got the steak and egg tacos. It was okay with all the ingredients together. The steak by itself was so good. Everything else was just okay. It's not something I would get again or would recommend.   I tried the French toast. That was really good! I definitely would recommend their French toast.   The service here was great. They were really nice. They were attentive and were so quick for the amount of people that were there.   I would recommend this place and come back here again.",

    "text": "Can I just start out and say I love brunch? I REALLY love brunch, and this place takes the cake for awesome brunches. I've frequented the container park a few different times and I always mean to come to this place and never end up coming. So one Sunday me and a friend decided to try this place on a whim, and wow we are glad we did! The location is easy to find and it even has its own private entrance so you don't have to go all the way through the container park. It was such a beautiful (and HOT) morning so when we decided to sit outside we have a plethora of options. A waitress came and gave us our menus and explained that we go in and order at the bar pay and they they will bring us out the food. Now mind you they have their bottomless mimosas (bloody Mary's wine peach Bellini etc.) all day everyday but we definitely had to try it for brunch. For an extra sixteen dollars with the purchase of an entree (I got the chicken and waffles) they serve you a full glass of champagne and a new bottle of champagne complete with a peach Bellini mixture and orange juice. It was amazing and yes it is a two hour max but wow we had trouble finishing the first bottle. (And we're no lightweights). They brought our food pretty quickly and I was impressed by the chicken and waffles. Is the best I've ever had? NO. But it was delicious, hot, and he whipped cream (which they make in house) made it top notch. Between the sunny weather, good food, and endless mimosas I left happy and full. I am coming back and plan to bring my friends with me.",

Steak sandwich was pretty good, and I did like the fries with it. My mother got a (equivalent to Greek) salad and added shrimp...she enjoyed it but we didn't feel it was worth the price. Crime brulee for dessert was on point!! The manager/owner came by to ask about our experience and feedback which was nice. Since its brand new, I feel if the management is very observant with guests, menu items and prices and are open to changing little things were need be for the better, the restaurant will do very well.",

Turns out they're quite carnivore friendly and focus on doing a few things very well.  Had the hanger steak frites, with garlic aeoli. Turns out the garlic aeoli goes better on the STEAK than the frites (fries), truly enhancing the flavor. Once I figured this out, I was good to go and had a delicious time. The fries are lightly salted, crisp, and tasty.   The service is great. I love how brightly lit the space is with clean lines and the pink-lit shelves behind the bar.

Unless you meet their arrogant, contemptuous group they will disregard you as a human and raise their nose in a disdainful manor. Saddly this place looked promising for any one of god's children. NOT HERE. I ended up just walking about a block away to an amazing, welcoming place called PARK ON FREMONT that is worth every red cent we spent on drinks and food between my brother and I. They literally made us feel as if we were regulars there. Professional, humble, welcoming, nose down, not thinking they were better then anyone and most of all down to earth keeping the customers their main priority not segregating those that don't meet a certain type. Dumb A's still exist as I learned today. STEER CLEAR FROM THE PERCH. HEAD DOWN TO WHERE THE PEOPLE MATTER ANYWHERE ELSE BUT AT THE PERCH",

    "text": "Boyfriend and I ordered the chimchurri chicken sandwich and told our waiter we'd be sharing it, friend ordered steak for himself.  Waited about 40 minutes for us to get our food and we weren't really sure why.  We were quite disappointed with the wait but once we did get our food we saw our waiter had split our sandwich and gave us both full orders of fries - SO nice of him, we were very appreciative.  It was VERY delicious, fries were very good too. I almost wrote my review right then because I was very impressed that 1) he split our food without asking and 2) the food was phenomenal.   But then, we waited another 30 minutes to get our check. There were two bartenders not helping the seated tables at all while 4 tables sat empty and a mess with dirty dishes begging to be bussed. I felt bad for our waiter as we stared at these bartenders dancing and wiping wet empty glasses behind the bar while only 2 people sat at the bar themselves. I stared at one of them, hoping he'd realize our plates were empty and we were obviously waiting for our check. He didn't seem to notice or bother.   I really don't blame our waiter; he seemed to be the only one really helping those not at the bar. Just kinda disappointed and hope this place gets things on track because aside from my grievances, it's prime location with delicious chicken.   Also, bartenders, you won't ever help the company you work for nor yourselves with the mentality of \"that's not my job so I'll wait for someone else to do it\".",

Which btw as long as everyone in your party has opted into the $15 endless mimosa,Bloody Mary and Bellini option you can have whole champagne and orange juice bottles sent to the table so you don't have to wait for a refill! We got there a little after 11 and the wait was an hour. But you can start your endless mimosas while you wait for your table. For as busy at it was, service was good and the food 5 stars!",

My son lives in the Art district so we all walked over to the park to eat. The people were very upbeat and friendly and the pale ales were very good but we must have caught them during shift change because the food took forever to come out. When it did I was very disappointed in the presentation and the size of the food vs the price. My fries looked like bbq burnt ends and the sandwiches were small. The main reason I'm writing this is my Wife's chicken Caesar salad. It looked very sad, came out in what appeared to  be the plastic lid from  a McDonalds salad. Terrible for a $11 salad. We didn't say too much and I controlled myself, finished and left. Instantly my wife's stomach became bloated and she felt sick. She had to utilize the rest room almost immediately. We went home and she spent the night back and forth in the restroom and having stomach issues.If you eat here don't be as nice as I was if you don't like the looks of your food. Unless you don't mind taking the chance and spending a sleepless night in the restroom.",

I decided to try their crab cake Benedict and gosh do I regret it. They flavor was just not good at all. Everything was over powered by this lemon or sour taste. The crab tasted really bad and there was no good flavors combining this whole dish. The boyfriend had their burger and he said it was really good. I also order my first Bloody Mary and gross! Hahaha never again but I don't blame them maybe I'm just not into that particular drink. Place is super cute and hopefully next time I come back what ever else I order turns out really tasty, so I can update this review and be able to give them an extra star or two",

If you are dining during regular hours and ordering a cocktail then I surely don't want to pay$ 10-$11 to have my cocktail in a plastic glass. I absolutely did not pay the full price for the drink for that. We ordered their lettuce cups and were disappointed .. the chicken was dry and smelled. We ordered their perch burger and vegetarian burger. The perch burger was ok .. the fried heirloom tomato in it was not a good idea. The vegetarian burger patty was over cooked and I think paying $ 15 for a vegetarian burger is a rip off. I can get 10 times better burger at better places at half the price . They are pay too overpriced otherwise.",

My meal was undercooked but I didn't want to complain or send it back so I ate two or three bites and boxed my meal up. My husband's meal came out last, after everyone else had been served so his meal was probably rushed. He was very hungry after a 12 miles hike and devoured what was otherwise a delicious meal. Unfortunately, my poor husband got food poisoning and was throwing up all night. I asked my friends the next day if they were feeling on after the meal and my friend told me her steak was under cooked as well and she didn't send it back for the same reason as me- it was a celebration and we are Mid-Westerners from Michigan who are just too nice to send stuff back. It was a big bummer my husband was throwing up all night. I emailed the manager, they asked for my number but never called me.",

    "text": "Located on the 2nd level of container park.  Very cute and bright space.  Menus are wrapped around napkins.   Green flash West coast ipa on tap!   Service is very slow. Do not come if you have hungry kids or are looking for a quick bite.  We ordered a side of French fries and it came with an aioli that tasted strongly of raw garlic.  Steak sandwich was nowhere close to medium rare as ordered- more like medium well to well done. Aioli that came with the sandwich had a strange skin on the top and may have sat around awhile before being served? Fries are thick cut rather than crispy.  Power greens salad had a super salty dressing.   I liked it but it may not be to everyone's taste.  My daughter said the same thing about her chicken pailliard dish.   Overall portions are on the small side but were perfect for our group.  I think there might be a kids menu? New Year's flyer mentioned it,  but we weren't offered it even though we had kids in our group.  Best to ask for it.  We would probably try one of the other eateries in the area before eating here again.",

    "text": "Unfortunately I'm unable to write a good review for this place. I was very excited to try it out since the whole area is new to me (last time I visited Vegas was about 6 years ago). I do not understand how this place has such great reviews, yet our visit turned out so bad. My husband and I arrived with kids in tow, ordered our drinks and food. The drinks (5 waters and 1 soda) took a while to get there, about 25 minutes. That should have been an indication of the wait time, but we waited patiently. There were about 2 other couples there. By the time we got our food it was over an hour later. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles, my husband ordered the Perch Burger. I didn't think that was something that would take so long to make. After waiting for 40 minutes we were finally apologized to and told that it was my syrup that took so long. My syrup??? Did they go drain some trees for maple syrup?? I was so confused but so hungry I didn't even bother to question it. When our food arrived I didn't complain because I was starving. It was disgusting. The chicken was over fried, I got a collar bone and other over fried pieces I couldn't even eat, the waffle was just ok, but I ate it because like I said I was so hungry. My husband offered me some of his burger (which he did not enjoy either--left half of it) because he felt bad, I declined but accepted some of his fries. The fries tasted as though they were fried in old beef fat or something gross. I had to stop eating and drink water. By the time we got back to the car I was feeling sick, sadly I threw up all of the Perch food in my new car....No thanks to you the Perch & employees.",

Even thought a meal I ordered I thought was too salty our waitress Chelsey insisted and took it back to remake even thought I felt bad about it...our waitress even offered to take out beer off our tab as she thought we were not satisfied with everything though we said it was okay. That type of service from our waitress, knowledge of beers and spirits from the bartender, and the professional manner of the cook that remade our food and brought it out personally, which tasted much better made it a great experience.  Take a break from donating to the casinos and come here to remove all the tension and have a great time.",

I picked Perch based off reviews etc. I talked it up the whole way there, telling them it was going to be a great experience.....well thanks a lot \"The Perch\" you made me look like an idiot to my coworkers. First the food took FOREVER to arrive....55 minutes. You would have thought the waitress would have brought free appetizers or something, but nope. We  had to sit there awkwardly for 55 minutes trying to think of things to discuss, the best discussion we had was concerning odd placed piercings etc... The place had 3 waiters for like 10 tables, but yet couldn't keep our drinks full. Food was ok, not worth $20 a person and an hour wait. The rest of the day my coworkers were not efficient at their jobs as they didn't get satisfied during lunch.... all they could talk about was the long wait at the Perch, and how MTO and Public Us were so much better. Needless to say they won't ever trust my judgement of picking a lunch spot again.",

There were employees that weren't working sitting at the bar & they kept bringing people in the kitchen for some reason. It took awhile to get waited on but service did improve.    We only ordered the Bianca flat bread. It was really good but it did not have one hint of white truffle oil that was supposed to be on it. Little disappointed about that.

Its located in a plaza with lots of other places and a stage with a green area. The restaurant is located one level up from the stage. Its small with indoor and outdoor seating. Be forewarned the AC is always on high so if you get cold easily then don't sit inside.   My friends ordered the unlimited mimosa's which I believe was $16. We ordered the eggs benedict, churro waffle, the breakfast sandwich and the french toast. All of the food was good and it came out quickly. The only thing I found to be sucky was that the portions were small. None of the plates came with any sides and they were out of monkey bread when I asked. Overall it was a good place.  *Note: If you check in and show the waiter you get a free wine or beer*",

    "text": "Alright, I'm breaking this up into different parts because I'd give a different star rating for different aspects.   FOOD: 5-stars! I'm already planning my next meal here. I ordered the veggie burger and my friends got the chilaquiles, breakfast sandwich and chicken and waffles. The chilaquiles might have been my favorite thing on the menu and by far the best I've ever had! There is a certain spice to it that I couldn't quite figure out but it's perfect- flavor and a little heat. The veggie burger was incredible and so flavorful. I mean seriously, even the fries were full of flavor and delicious. They put some Swiss cheese with spicy corn on top of the burger... the whole thing was gone in minutes. Although I didn't try the breakfast sandwich, my picky eater friend was ranting and raving about it which is a rare phenomenon. The chicken and waffles feedback wasn't great, however. It was described to us as \"very filling\" but everyone who ordered it was still hungry and ended up wishing they had ordered something else.   SERVICE: 4-stars because our server was great and managed to salvage my original experience which was closer to 3-stars. When we walked in, we stood there for a bit unsure of whether we sat ourselves or waited to be seated. There weren't any signs that instructed one way or the other and no one came over to us or even acknowledged our arrival. Finally, my friend sought out someone from behind the bar who promised to have seating for five people available within the next 15 minutes. Once we were seated, we had waters within a few minutes and were able to put in our food orders soon after that. When we asked for our checks, we were informed the system went down. We made it work but had to remind them after waiting for a while we were still trying to pay.   ATMOSPHERE: 4-stars. It's a really fun environment but extremely busy and LOUD because the place is small. There is limited seating inside and with it being so hot so often in Vegas, outdoor seating isn't always an option. We got there around 1 pm and were pretty much shouting to each other until it died down around 2:30. It's a really good time though, very lively and energetic vibes.   PRICING: The average brunch entree was probably around $13-$15 and the bottomless drinks (Bellini, Bloody Mary, mimosa) were $17 per person, rounded up.",

    "text": "After a fun evening of soaking in a bit of Vegas history at the Neon Museum, my friend and I decided we wanted to grab dinner at a nearby restaurant, so we headed towards container park and agreed to try Downtown Terrace. I had previously been to this location when it was named The Perch and I absolutely loved the food so I figured why not try it again. My only concern was that if they changed their name then they possibly changed owners, which therefore meant the food might've changed as well. Rest assured, that is certainly not the case. While they have a new name, they still have the same owners, same great service, and the same fantastic food that'll keep you coming back.  My friend and I decided to sit at the bar and have a few drinks before our meal. Brandon was our bartender and I must say he was the just the absolute best. He was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. The exceptional service he provided was simply above and beyond any bartender I've seen before. He checked on us often, brought us our food promptly, and made sure we were satisfied the entire evening. One thing that I noticed is if you're sitting at a bar and you order an alcoholic beverage as well as a water, most bartenders will only focus on getting you your next drink, even when your water goes empty. However, Brandon always made sure that my water was refilled which I truly appreciate. He seemed to understand that while I like to enjoy my drinks, I also like to pace myself with water to prevent a future hangover. Truly appreciate that attention to detail.  As for our meal, every item we ordered was delicious! We started off with the calamari and the ceviche as our appetizers. The calamari came with a jalapeno lemon sauce that was so good and the ceviche was very refreshing with just the perfect amount of lime juice. Definitely something I'd order again in the future. For our entrees, I tried the spicy shrimp penne pasta. Loved the flavor of this dish as the sauce was savory with just the perfect hint of spice. My friend had a turkey burger which was flavored so perfectly that he scarfed down every last bite of it. While we were tempted to order dessert, our tummy's were so pleasantly stuffed that we decided to pass on it this time, but made a mental note that next time we're in container park, we will gladly stop into Downtown Terrace again for another delicious meal with a sweet dessert at the end.",

The menu itself offers quite a variety ensuring everyone in your group finds something they like, and everything I have had tastes good. Service is a bit slow, so make sure to plan for that.  Where Downtown Terrace shines, though, is brunch. Bottomless drink offerings include mimosas, bellinis, blood marys, and house wine. Do yourself a favor and get a mimosa or bellini. Most servers will refill your glass with only sparkly, making the $16 price tag a steal. Perfect start to your Saturday or Sunday (or both).",

Now I could be cruel and give this place 2 stars based off customer service, But mind you it was NASCAR weekend and very busy. We came yesterday 3/3/2019 at around 11:40am got seated outside there was 3 of us including myself we ordered the all you can drink for $16 ( With the purchase of an entree) I also ordered the crab Benedict with a side of potatoes, When we first started ordering the drinks they kept coming in sequence after the 3rd one the service got bad. mind You, you only have a 2 hour drinking limit. Then I never seen our waitress again. We asked about 3 different people for drinks before I finally went in and asked again. We sat there until about 2pm and still had nobody check on our table or even bring us a check. My friend finally went in and had to ask for a check. Extremely disappointed in the lack of customer service. I will give this place one more try though, like I said busy weekend. The food and drinks were amazing though!",

They can interchange. They have a cute patio outside setting with couches and tables and even booths looking out towards the stage where they have music on the weekends. We were helped by Mike and he was great! He even came outside to the patio to take our order when there's a sign that says to go inside to place your order. We ordered i'm Imosa, Balenie, and a bloody Mary and it was all delicious. They make their Bellini's with peach puree and peach schnapps and their Mimosa's taste like fresh squeezed orange juice. Delicious! We ordered the Terrace Burger and Oz Burger with arugula and it was tasty! Mike was great, so we had amazing service and the atmosphere was perfect to spend the day here drinking the unlimited deal. For this I rated it 5 stars. I would definitely recommend this place to spend the day and come back here again, it was perfect. They even have extended patio space for people that want to smoke!",

    "text": "On Sunday March 5th, 2017 I brought my family in to The Downtown Terrace after a friend of mine referred it as a great place to have brunch with my family.   It was the WORST EXPERIENCE that I subjected my family too.   There was a female bartender with purple hair and tattoos on her face that kept using profanity across the Resturant and yelling at that poor innocent blonde girl with the tattoos on her arms. I felt really bad for her that she has to be subjected to such a work environment. I watched it go on for awhile as she kept getting bullied. I don't know if that's her manager or what, But a person should NEVER be treated like that.   We didn't mind the long wait to be seated, since the place was super packed and it's expected anywhere on a Sunday. But after we ordered our food, it seemed like a decade before we got our food and it wasn't hot and felt like it had been sitting out for awhile. The next day I went to go talk to the General Manager and explain what happened. Before I knew it, he started threatening me to beat me up cause he said he was from the streets and that's how he handles things. I can't believe that company would hire such a person that acts like that to paying customers and to be put in that position to deal with the public.   Let's just say that I will never be visiting that place again and will tell everyone I know and all social media that is attached to that place how horrible of a place it is.  I feel really bad for Mr. Hsieh for having such people represent him like that and for Downtown Project.",

The Perch is located at the very rear of Container Park, so you don't see it at you enter the Park.  Two very friendly security guards greeted us at the entrance, informed us that only one place was open (the retailers open at 11 AM), \"The Perch\" they said and directed to the rear.  The approach is very inviting with a terrace that's starts as a sky walk, leads to the entrance, then continues around the entire bistro.    The staff was wonderfully positive with welcoming warm smiles and present natures.    The ambiance is jazzy with a hyper-modern mix that is bright while intimate ... a pleasing dichotomy.

When we arrived we were greeted by the hostess and were told we had to wait for 15-30 minutes for a table. It worked out for us because there was a cool toy store right below that we played around in and in no time we were texted to come back up. When we got back up to the restaurant the hostess did not address us first, but addressed the couple behind us and seated them. This kind of set me off because we were literally standing in front of her and had been told to come back up. After seating them the hostess finally asked us how many was in our party and we told her 3 but also told her we were here prior and received a text to let us know to come back up. We were seated and got the usual all you can drink specials that many brunch spots have. My husband got the mimosa and I chose to get the Bellini which was super sweet for me. My husband got the steak and eggs tacos which he really enjoyed and I got the shrimp and grits which I enjoyed. I have never personally had the shrimp and grits before so I have nothing to compare it to but thought the sauce on it paired really well with the salad. Overall the food was good ,but the first experience with the hostess made me not feel very welcome.",

Hidden in rear by the stage, where live entertainment was kicking off and a family friendly atmosphere was surrounding us, on the second floor was a little place called Downtown Terrace. We came into the air conditioning to escape the heat since there was plenty of room. We sat by the window.   Raven ordered the Bruschetta and I the Steak and fries, rare with an Old Fashioned. The Bruschetta was refreshing and compliant-free. The steak, however, was the show stealer! Cooked to a perfect rare, it was so good! It was paired with these olive oil covered crispy fries. I would recommend this place 100%. The atmosphere was laid back and the music soothing and amendable to conversation.",

The server mentioned they were out of broccoli and offered asparagus as a replacement, which we were totally fine with.  After about thirty five minutes, we started to wonder where our food was, especially since some tables seated after us had already received their meals. Our server came by and apologized and said the food was being plated.   We then waited another fifteen minutes to get our food. The steak was overcooked, they ran out of ingredients for several of the dishes, and forgot to add the replacement ingredients.   Overall, it was very poor service and a terrible wait for an average meal.",

I was happy that my rare steak did indeed come out rare (a lot of restaurants don't seem to take you seriously that you want your steak rare, so they give it to you medium rare). While it was a perfect done-ness, it was filled with so much gristle that I probably wasted a good portion of the steak spitting it out on the side of the plate. The seasoned butter was a yummy addition, and the fries were a generous portion and done just right. I was simply disappointed in the quality of the steak, especially for the price, and the fact that, while I am in no terms what you would call a picky eater, the steak and fries was the only thing on the menu that looked appealing to me.  The ambiance was terrific - we sat outside in a nice cool night breeze, and our service was friendly and helpful.  Just need to work on the menu . . .",

Be right with you, they said. But, they never were. More than 10 minutes passed and we didn't have waters, menus or any attention. We got up and left.

No, but really, we are from out of town, visiting friends and they took us to the infamous \"Container Park\". We stumbled across Downtown Terrace and decided to have a few appetizers and some drinks. It was rather slow when we came in and then drastically filled up with eager restaurant goers all at once. At first, our waiter was very attentive but gradually we saw less and less of him......until the point we thought maybe he left??? Anyways, long story short, our drinks took forever and our food took an eternity. Normally I would leave a horrible review for a place like this but after darkness there is always light. BRENDAN and NORA both came over to our table and made us feel like guests in their own home. They took full responsibility for the lack of service and apologized. It was so bad they offered to cover our tab and offered us another round on them. We were actually shocked! It is so RARE in the service industry these days that managers acknowledge shit service and do something about it. Shit happens. Restaurants get unexpected rushes. People get cut when its slow and then it picks up. People call in sick. It's life. Anyways, we ended up leaving them a nice tip and we will be back!! Food was bomb and we felt the employees ACTUALLY took pride in their jobs and genuinely cared. At the end of the day.....thats called 5 star SERVICE!!!!!",

I went with the french toast which was good. It wasn't the best, but it was good and filling. My friend got the breakfast sandwich and it was very tasty.    Definitely need to share this.... I hit up The Perch every other week for lunch... Always get the Terrace Salad with shrimp and it's AWESOME.    The Perch is my favorite lunch venue in DTLV.  Always in and out with 45 minutes!  I would definitely go back and try a few other brunch ideas!  Lunch is a must!",

A friend wanted to order their Power Greens salad, assuming the veggies were cooked and when the Server explained that it was a chilled salad, my friend decided against it. Well, when our food came out, the chef had prepared a plate of cooked power greens on the house! AWESOMESAUCE!  Finally, the service. From the moment we walked in to the final waving of good-bye, they were ON POINT! We laughed. We joked. We smiled. We were happy the ENTIRE time, both times!  It's a great little spot!

He found it to be delicious. I enjoyed the fried jalapeno strips. My partners choice for an entree was the spicy shrimp pasta. He really enjoyed it!

Had some crab louie salad.  So they cut an avocado in 2, slop a brown looking ball of god knows what into the pit area, and set it on top of some butter leaf lettuce.  Easily the worst I have ever seen in this type of fare.  My little friend got who knows what, but even she was put off by the food.  It looked bad from my side of the table.    Maybe this is the best you can do downtown, but I can get excellent, and tasty, dinner entrees at places like the Venetian for about the same money.  Better ambiance too.  I don't give a crap if it is supposed to be a cool hipster dive.  It was an awful experience and the food was downright repulsive.",

    "text": "So, we happened across the Downtown Terrace trying to escape the madness of the strip on a Saturday morning.  What a fabulous find!  We were treated to some very interesting brunch choices.  We had their spin on shrimp and grits, a corn salad with shrimp and chimichurri, and a shortrib hash.  We also split an order of their monkey bread between four of us.  Every ingredient tasted fresh and well prepared.  We will be back on our next trip into Vegas!",

I left with two new Facebook friends (the bartenders) :) and the best memories.  We met the manager or assistant while sitting at the bar and couldn't wait to come back for another meal.  Honestly, the food and drinks were so unique, we are planning another trip to Vegas in a few months, just to experience their lunch and dinner menus.  The service was truly one of a kind - so personal and friendly and because their drinks were so delicious, we spent about $100 just on beverages - LOL!  Outstanding place!  We love you, The Perch!!!",

Amazing service !! Sat at the bar and the bartenders took amazing care of my friend and I. It helped that the bartender happened to be eye candy with his scruff, nose piercing, tatts , great smile and even better personality .   Perfect place to unwind after a long day.",

Yes its also very pricey (not any more than bin702, but obviously more than tacos or bbq), but the presentation and satisfaction makes it worth it. Drink are amazing and service is on point.

    "text": "Looooooove going to the Container Park in downtown, and this little cozy restaurant/lounge is located within the park. Stopped by for some food around 9pm and there wasn't many people around. We ordered fries with garlic aioli, beef tartare, power green salad, terrace salad, mushroom flatbread and salmon tiradito (omg that's a lot of food even for four people haha)! Food was very good, I love loved the terrace salad as well as the power green salad. There was nothing special about the fries even though the garlic aioli was amazing! Personally I'm not a huge fan for raw food so I didn't enjoy the beef tartare or the salmon tiradito, but my friends loved them! Service here was decent, it took a little bit before our waiter showed up at the beginning but after that, everyone was very attentive. They constantly came by to check on how everything's going and filled our water. Oh! Did I mention that there was a live band playing downstairs as well? So there was a nice view, good music and delicious food. Definitely will be back soon and try some of other things on their menu.",

As much as we enjoyed this spot numerous times for brunch we will not be coming back.

The restaurant itself is really nice with nth indoor and outdoor seating and a very cool and modern design.  WE came hungry so we ordered almost everything in the menu and we're extremely impressed! Some highlights: Tuna tartare: one of the best I've had , melt in your mouth with mango and avocado, highly recommended.  Lettuce cups: steak!! So fresh!! Best I've ever had Chicken sandwich: I barely ever order chicken when I go out but this sounded so good so I went for it. Sooo tasty! Very unique!!  Desserts: we tasted all of them and each of them we're amazing!  Staff and service: impeccable and extremely friendly!   DO YOURSELF AND YOUR APPETITE A FAVOR AND GO CHECK OUT THIS AMAZING SPOT!!",

He is polite, professional and funny as hell.  He always remembers what we drink and always humors us when we change our minds at the last second.  The carpaccio is my absolute favorite, although I think my twin would say the Fried Chicken Sandwich and our older sister definitely vies for the calamari. They make the Bloody Mary Mix fresh every day and it is the best I have ever had.  Not to mention, they are super kid friendly!  We bring our whole crew (3 adults and 5 kids) for dinner on movie night in the summers and even the kids are totally happy and comfortable.  The big booths outside are the best, provided it isn't too windy.  Great food, yummy drinks (Ask for a bloody beer if you're into it - Blanc and Bloody Mary Mix - to die for), and extraordinary service.",

Ordered their lardon salad (forget the actual name) and couldn't have been happier - beautiful greens, with thick cut bacon, a poached egg and a champagne vinaigrette - added the chicken (dry) which was unnecessary. Portion was not over the top, but satisfying. We also ordered another salad with corn, avocado, and shrimp which was equally delicious. The chicken lettuce wraps were good, but would have been better if the chicken wasn't so dry.",

First impressions, it was a nice \"hip\" place with the menus folded into napkin holders. It was super clean, modern designed. We were seated immediately and given ice water without having to ask. Great customer service, we had a great server. I forgot his name but he was always checking on us and making sure we were eating well. We ended up getting the Perch burger, which was amaaaazing. I loved it. I couldn't even finish it all so I took the rest home. Overall a great night. I recommend to a younger crowd since it was a little noisy.",

We were tempted by the $15 bottomless brunch drinks, but we're extremely disappointed when they arrived at the table. I was texting a friend and didn't even look up from my phone at the drink that had been placed before commenting \"this smells like it's going to taste bad.\" My brother took the first drink of the Bloody Mary, and scrunched his face up immediately. I started to drink mine and it too was awful. By that point our mom had called and we needed to leave to meet her so we didn't bother complaining, or trying to get the drinks switched. Instead we told them that we needed to leave and would just like to pay for the single priced bloody Mary's. Alone they are $10 each, which is complete insanity. How are you going to charge someone $10 for that garbage? I will say the food looked amazing, but they need to figure out what's up with their mixed drinks.",

While the service was very friendly, it was also very slow. It took quite a while to just get our drinks ordered and they brought my drink out ten minutes after my friend got theirs.   I ordered the fried chicken sandwich which sounded delicious on the menu. When it showed up, the chicken was one of those frozen particle chicken patties you find in the frozen food section and the bun was just a cheap burger bun. Definitely NOT worth the $15 price tag. I would've been more satisfied with a fried chicken sandwich from Wendy's because at least they give you a real chicken breast for a third of the price. It was like eating a big chicken nugget.   My friend had the super green salad which she said was good and a spicy tomato bisque which was also decent.",

So here's the break down:  Pros: - the ambiance and outdoor seating - the perch burger - the cucumber cocktail  Cons: - these service was horrible. Waited 10 minutes to be seated on a non busy night mostly because the host person was too busy chatting it up with his friends. Whom by the way arrived after we were already waiting.  - another 20 minutes before anyone came over to get drink orders/ bring water.  - our orders were taken by one of the bartenders that took it upon herself to come from around the bar to help us. We never actually got a waiter. - after she dropped our food off (about 30 minutes after we ordered) she disappeared.  - after she disappeared literally NO ONE came to check on our table. We had to walk in and ask the bartender for our check.  Needless to say, we won't come back.",

Terrace Salad: decent, but they ran out of chimichura sauce & didn't replace it with anything, so ended up being very bland. Can't say much about steak with Brussels sprouts & asparagus, but the veggies were pretty good. Spicy pasta, eh. No complaints, but not going to write home about it. The big problem was the chicken quinoa. Took a bite, and my tongue immediately shriveled up like a slug sprinkled with salt. Thought it might just be me, so had 2 other in party try, and they agreed. Called the waiter over, told him the problem, said I'd just take a salad instead. 20 minutes later, after the rest of the table was finished, they brought the salad out. And it was wonderful! But my waiter didn't bring it out & didn't come to check on us ever. I had to ask 2 other people for the check, and when it came, I had to ask them again to put the drinks on a separate bill from the food-which the original waiter had assured us was no problem. So, great starter place, but recommend going elsewhere for dinner.",

Perch is on the second level, with indoor & outdoor seating.    What I liked most about Perch:  1. Customer service - far & away Perch offered the best customer service I experienced during my stay in downtown Las Vegas.  The staff was very friendly, informative, & accommodating.  2. Diversity of menu - there were several options, making this a great place to go with people with different tastebuds!  The only suggestion I have for improvement is the wait time.  When I arrived, late on a weekday evening, the place was maybe 20% full & most people seemed to have already received their food.  I ordered a very simple salad to take out & it took at least 30 minutes to come out.  I was a bit surprised given the circumstances.  I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a great solo dining option or place to go with friends to grab lunch/dinner.",

We went for brunch and mimosas to celebrate my sister's birthday. The place is small and busy so it's far from quiet but apparently singing happy birthday is just too much to handle and we were asked to leave. We will not be returning or recommending this place to anyone. We spent hundreds of dollars at this place and they were serving bottomless mimosas. You can't expect quiet with that especially when a single group is the majority of your customers. There was no crude or explicit material and we were only kicked out after all our tabs had been paid. Convenient timing. One male and two females at the bar disapproved of a large group of friends having fun...it's a shame they didn't join us and decided to complain instead.   I would highly recommend going to Whist at The District for brunch, you will not be disappointed.",

The bartender was quick to recommend beer choices for both of us based on our taste, and he did a great job; we both loved our choices.   We started off with an order of the fries; they were hand cut and came with garlic aioli- crispy and super yummy! I ordered The Terrace salad- corn, onions, shrimp, avocado- AMAZING.

    "text": "We came here on a summer afternoon at the Container Park. There were only a couple other people in the place, so it felt pretty empty even though the place itself was relatively small. It had a nice vibrant atmosphere with the natural lights and clean minimal style. The service was just okay, but I wouldn't look too much into it. Outlets were also available, so we even saw a guy with his laptop out at the bar.   The food was a bit overpriced in my opinion, but delicious. I got the salmon on top of a bed of asparagus and brussel sprouts which I loved. They asked me how I wanted my salmon cooked which I've never heard of before. The veggies were cooked perfectly. We also got the bianca flatbread to start. It was a perfect appetizer for two or even a small meal for someone who isn't that hungry. My boyfriend got the chopped salad with added grilled shrimp on top. There were only a couple pieces of shrimp that shouldn't really warrant a $6 up charge. The salad itself was very good. The dill dressing was the best he's ever had and the apples and mangos were perfect additions. If he didn't order the overpriced shrimp, he said he would consider it the best quality salad, considering the price was only $10.  Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone with a couple of dollars to spend while downtown at the Container Park. It fills you up nicely without leaving you too full to where you can't explore the adventures downtown.",

The perch is a really cute date spot if you're looking for something cute & fun! They have a bar and all their food looks super tasty. Make sure to make reservations on weekends because they get busy! I recommend sitting outside because it's right by the stage where they have mini concerts :-)  When we first walked in, we were super confused on what to do. After a minute, someone greeted us & asked if we had reservations. We didn't, but they accommodated us quickly and found us a table inside. I wanted to sit outside, but we didn't have reservations so I didn't want to be complicated. They walked us to a table & we sat there waiting for menus. Little did we know, they were folded around the napkins! lol  Anyway, everything was amazing. My boyfriend ordered the Chimi Chicken Sandwich and I ordered the Hangar Steak Sandwich. We also had an order of fries on the side (not knowing my sandwich came with fries.) The chicken sandwich comes with quac and chips which definitely beats chipotle's dumb overpriced guac. Dumb guac!!!!!! Both sandwiches were very flavorful, but I felt that the fries needed more seasoning. We had to add a bunch of salt & pepper onto ours.  4 stars because the food took reaaaaaally long to come out, but everything was worth the wait.  Total came out to $34.59 -- Not too shabby!   Love it here, will come back to try their cocktails :-)",

    "text": "What a cute little place inside Container Park!  I went to The Perch with a few of my girlfriends from out of town to grab a drink and appetizers before dinner. We took a seat at the bar; I got the garlic aioli fries and a Bloody Mary.   The garlic aioli fries came out freshly fried; hot, crunchy, and very flavorful. Lots of garlic which I can't complain as I'm a huge fan of any food involved with heavy garlic. Delish!  The Bloody Mary was neat because you get to build your own. They give you a cup poured of any vodka you prefer, a decanter of tomato juice, a side of horseradish, hot sauce, and olives. What a fun and original concept to create a Bloody Mary to your liking at a restaurant... you don't get to do that every day!  Our bartender was very attentive to our needs, however, he didn't smile. It bothered me a little. I don't expect bartenders to be cheesing constantly, but try to look like you're enjoying your time working even a tiny bit...  Anyway, I give The Perch a 4/5. Will come back here next time I visit Container Park.",

Restaurant itself seems to be more on the upscale side and modernish. Everything is impeccably clean and nothing out of place. The bar seems to be stocked fairly well, and the music they play is inspiring, albeit a little loud for me personally. The menu was refreshing, clean (no clutter), and evoked thoughts of grandeur.  Food though was a different story.   Ordered the cheeseburger with bacon, and took the bacon off to feed my cats. The bacon was very brown, crispy, wrinkled, and stiff. Looked very tasty and not greasy (cat enjoyed immensely). The Burger itself seemed to be dry and tasteless and very well cooked, like all the moisture was cooked out. Might be fine for some but I prefer mine a little less dry.  Might come back next time am in area, not overly sure.",

For one, you have to order your food at the front which at first, I was ok with. But then I realized it was a detriment since NO ONE was checking on us. 35 minutes later and no food (bacon and eggs and 2 burgers protein style - all items that shouldn't take this long). After my patience ran thin, I went up to the bartender and asked where our food was. Another 10 minutes and our food FINALLY arrived! The only one thing that salvaged the horrible customer service was the food since it was very good. However, customer service is huge for me and waiting for your food for 45 minutes is unacceptable, with absolutely no one checking on you.",

The food arrived: Acai bowl was watery and didn't even taste like acai. It's an acai bowl, how could you mess that up? We made the waitress take it back. Then came the simple two eggs your way breakfast, asked for the eggs scrambled. They were overlooked, rubbery, and had no taste. Had to put sooo much salt and pepper but it did no justice to the fact that it had a rubbery texture. How could you mess up SCRAMBLED eggs? And the potatoes weren't even warm, they were cold. The chicken and waffle sliders were okay, but nothing special even though it looked pretty. Then we waited 30 minutes just to pay, we couldn't find our waitress, and no one asked if we were ready even though we were on our phones the whole time waiting with no food on our plates. Not sure if I just had a bad experience, but I had high expectations for this place.",

I had really high hopes for our lunch date at The Perch but we must've come in at the worst time because the service was REALLY lacking. It was almost time for us to get up and find another place to grab some Sunday afternoon brunch when our server finally showed up. We seriously sat there and watched from outside about 3-5 servers grouped around the bar chatting and walking around and resetting the indoor tables (that weren't even being used because it was such a nice day). I've been a server before, cool if you're doing a shift change but don't do it where customers are waiting to be greeted! We can see you & it looks really bad when we're thirsty and hungry, okay?   When we finally did get someone to take our drink and food orders... they weren't extremely knowledgeable about their drink selections. We worked through it and found a beer to try. That was about the only good thing about this lunch, the beer.   We ordered a few small bites: a large chopped salad and shrimp scampi. For the price point we thought it was going to be an actual Shrimp Scampi dish with pasta. Forgive me if I sound a bit country here but where the heck was the food?! We got a few pieces of shrimp in some sauce. The sauce was decent, but that's about it. I could not get over calling the dish shrimp scampi and not having pasta. The chopped salad was just doing too much... too many weird flavors with all the ingredients.   Perhaps the service was a fluke and it bled into the rest of our experience. Maybe one afternoon we'll give this place another shot. Hopefully it'll be better.",

    "text": "I offered to take my best friend to brunch for his birthday. We parked right outside container park. Expecting him to pick either Eat or Vegenation I was shocked when he picked Perch out of nowhere.   I had passed Perch in the past and never thought twice about going there so I was quite pleased with the decision. Upon entering the restaurant we were immediately greeted and the hostess seated us. After I sat down I looked around to take in the atmosphere and noticed everyone was dressed rather nicely and was quite attractive. I felt out of place wearing shorts/tank top/flip flops.   Our waiter comes over (Miguel) and takes our drink order and makes menu recommendations. We ordered bottomless mimosas, monkey bread to start, the shrimp and grits, and the perch breakfast sandwich.   The monkey bread was sticky and gooey, everything you could have wanted in a good dessert (we frequently start with dessert). My breakfast sandwich comes out with it looking pretty good, the side of potatoes came out looking like they were straight from a microwave. My friends shrimp and grits had a nice heat going through it but ultimately were tasteless. I do not hold the restaurant accountable because I know from being quite the foodie that grits is a hard dish to make amazing.   Ultimately it was a nice brunch that came out to 80$ after gratuity. I was torn between a 3 and 4 star rating but decided on a 3 with the food outweighing the atmosphere. I would eat here again with the realization that I'm paying way too much for what I'm actually consuming.   My tips .......... I feel when the bottomless mimosas are ordered your food order is expedited to get you out quicker cutting out what could be more time for mimosas. Try the delicious monkey bread !!! Very friendly staff",

Crab Cake: Lots of crab meat. The sauce is spicy. 4/5  Fries with Garlic Aioli: Amazingly crunchy. They must double fry their potatoes. The aioli had a strong garlic flavor which I love. I can finish the entire plate all by myself. 4.5/5  Salmon: Comes with Brussels sprouts, asparagus and topped with guacamole. The Brussels sprouts were tender and I like them a bit crunchy. The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned. 3/5  The Terrace: Shrimp with Chimichurri, grilled corn, avocado, and tomato. Refreshing and light. I love the flavor combo. 4/5  Try their flatbreads! Their portions are perfect which means if you're into super sized meals, you might want to get lots of food...that is if you're willing to pay $8-15 per plate.",

We had the Big Blue van beer , which was infused with blueberry, but very subtlety. As for the food, we went for the burger and the chopped salad. They have bottomless mimosas for $15, which is a steal!!   Will def return! Great food and drink and amazing customer service!",

When we checked out the menu, we decided to have a late lunch - which was really pretty fabulous:  Fried Green Tomatoes done with light corn meal and a tasty side sauce - we ordered a double, because...  well, because we were so excited to have them!  Tuna Tartar with mango and avocado was as lovely as it was tasty, served with a side of crisp crackers.  And hand cut Fries, plenty to share.  Sis had a hard iced tea and proclaimed it perfect - I had a soft lemonade and was happy, too.  We enjoyed our impromptu lunch on the deck, overlooking the rest of the park.  Inside there were also tables and air conditioning and a beautiful full bar.  Service was quick and super nice - definitely check out The Perch!",

Perch is located in Container Park near downtown.  The decor is simple and the restaurant has a great view.  Make sure to make a reservation on the weekends because the place gets packed. I went with a group of ten people and everyone loved their food.  I had the chicken chimichurri sandwich and it was delicious!  Just enough sauce and spice.  The French fries were seasoned to perfection and crispy. Hubby got the chicken n waffles...the waffle was to die for!  Now for the best part- $15 bottomless bloody marys, bellinis and mimosas!  The bloody mary was spicy and not too filling.  The bellinis, made with peach juice, champagne and peach schnapps were a nice change from just the basic mimosa.  I can't remember our server's name, I wrote it down in my notes on the Yelp app, but somehow lost it (she had short blonde hair).  She was amazing!  She kept the bottle of champagne flowing and even split our checks at the end.  Can't wait to go back here on our next visit to Vegas.",

They made me another batch. Still terrible. Something in the coating they use is just wrong it make it so rock solid it's break teeth. Flavour isn't all that either. Seems like it's been cooked for days then dropped in the dryer again Prior to serving.   I'd struggle to ever go back here again. Even though the tacos we good.",

Container Park gives a welcoming and refreshing ambiance to hangout so having late brunch makes it even better. They offer bottomless mimosas with a purchase of an entree, but you could also opt for Bloody Mary or Bellinis instead. It was around 2pm when we arrived but we were told it would be an hour wait. The menu is short yet simple with a good variety of entrees to try. The steak benedict stood out to me as it is not your traditional egg benedict with english muffin but instead are replaced with hashbrown. It tasted delicious and I was surprisingly satisfied with my meal. The steak was tender and full of flavor from the benedict and the hashbrowns were a nice addition to the meal. It is definitely an entree I would want to order again. My friend ordered their salmon which was just as delicious too! The salmon wasn't too dry and it was very savory. If you're looking for a place that serves bottomless mimosas then this is the place to try out! Mimosas were a nice addition to their entrees which I wasn't expecting at all!",

(Boo) We still stuck around and ordered some food and drinks. I had a Watermelon Hefeweizen which was on draft and very tasty. The watermelon flavor was light and crispy, not overbearing at all. For food I had the Mediterranean wrap. It was tasty and healthy.   I would definitely come back here again. I FOR SURE need to take advantage of their $16 bottomless deal. I do imagine it gets super busy on the weekends since it's not a super big space, but on a weekday was easy peasy to find a seat inside.",

I could imagine how awesome it is to sit here at night with the lights and live music. We sat inside since it was 105 outside. 3 servers in the place and all 3 were friendly and helpful.   We sat at the long table with the faux fire glass in the middle and the stools had nice comfy cushions on them. We ordered several drinks and a few apps just hanging out for a bit while we are visiting with family.  I ordered the \"embrace your adventure\" mojito with Starr Rum, blackberries and mint. So light crisp and refreshing.  My hubby ordered the lemon haze. I don't like gun and this drink was delish! Sister in law ordered the mule with absolut blackberries and mint. Also delicious.  The drinks took a bit to come out but it's because they took their time crafting each cocktail individually.    We ordered the Bianca flatbread, pork potstickers and the carne asada fries. Portions a bit on the small side for the price but holy flavorful and scrumptious!! The flatbread was nice and crisp and the truffle oil just made all the flavors of the cheeses pop. The potstickers were light and delicious with a nice crisp outer edge and chewy center. And the fries? ...amazing. Packed with a ton of ingredients and the meat was cooked perfectly.  Glad we stopped by to check this spot out and we will definitely come back at night next time we are in town.",

We walked in to the bar and the bartender said we could not sit inside unless we asked someone but he was the only person there so we asked him and he said we had to ask someone else. We saw a bus boy outside and he said it was okay. We say and a waiter came out and we looked over the menu and ordered drinks. A Moscow mule, raspberry mojito, and a beer. The mule was unlike any we have ever had in a bad way. It was sweet, like the poured straight syrup in there sweet. Not good at all. But the mojito was perfect, so good!  As I was sitting on the terrace, I checked in on Yelp. I saw that we get a free beer for checking in. Another waiter came by and asked how we were doing and we said we were ready for the check, I showed him the free beer and he got irritated with me for not showing our waiter when we first walked in. 1. This guy was not our waiter, who was he to get bothered? 2. There was no sign saying to check in right away! 3. I was annoyed that he said something about it to us, he should go in the back and vent to his coworkers like a normal person not explain to me the time he will need to spend comping the beer now.  Overall I liked the mojito and outdoor vibe of this place but not the mule and def not the service.",

Pictured:  Strawberry jalapeno infusion, fresh lemonade, mimosa  Thai chicken salad- it was good but pretty simple and boring just lettuce mix with chicken and sauce.

Overall, this is great place to grab American comfort food.",

I had the steak Benedict, my friend had the chicken and waffles and they were both delicious and satisfying. The steak Benedict was served on hash browns with a bernaise instead of a hollandaise and it was the perfect tang for it. I'm not a big hash brown eater, but these were like, McDonalds good (don't lie- you love them haha). The chicken and waffles had fruit and whipped cream that made it just sweet enough and not overly so. And the staff is always super friendly and attentive. Thanks for my bloody Mary's !",

I turned 21 over a week ago and they kept staring at my I.D as if it was fake and kept talking amongst themselves for a few minutes. Finally they made my alcoholic drink.  I got the cucumber fizz.  It was okay, not great.  I'm a nice guy, left them a tip despite not feeling it there.  My two friends then went there for drinks and they said the service was horrible, which I fairly agreed with.  One got his drink and the other was waiting way too long for his. Keep in mind that this is a small place and not too busy at 10:00 PM when we went.  So he walked out because it took too long.  We were leaving Container Park and almost at the exit, then we hear someone yelling from a distance. It's was one of the bartenders chasing after us to tell us, INCLUDING ME WHO PAID AND GAVE A TIP TO HIM DESPITE BAD SERVICE, accusing us of not paying for our drinks.  We said we did (which we did), and even offered to walk up with him, but he said its fine.  These guys need to adjust their attitude and quick because that left a very sour taste in me with this place.  This gets a 1.5 rating, NOT a full two.  Update (in response to The Perch's comment):  I appreciate the response.  Very timely.  If I'm in the area again, hopefully soon since I live in Los Angeles area, I'll stop by.",

The feeling of a dozen daggers in your back and dozen sets of eyes silently drilling fiery holes through your pathetic self?   Yup, that's me. F Pigalle was closed on Monday, so I pitched The Perch, thinking it would be a great time.   I made a reservation weeks ahead of time, confirmed morning of, all was going well.   Our evening unraveled just about immediately. Our table was ready (yay) with zero wait, right on time. But then time came to figure out who will be taking care of us and when that person would make appearance.  Guess what 14 people that got out of a day full of meetings want to do right away? Ding ding ding. I won't go into boring details, but it was 55 minutes from the time we sat down until every member of our party had a drink. No joke. Almost an hour. By that time first served were, yep, done with their drinks. We couldn't even kick off an evening with a toast. I get handcrafted cocktails, but was it possible to staff more than one bartender considering there was a three weeks advance notice?...  The drink fiasco that dragged out for an hour put such a damper on everyone's mood, I'm not even sure anyone paid much attention to food. I tried calimari and will say it was delicious, my veggie burger was tasty, but fries were super lame. They were so inconsistent plate to plate, you couldn't really tell what they should taste like. Mine were golden brown, over fried and dry, the appetizer ones were thick and soggy. So bizarre.  I will say, I dreaded food coming out as dragged out as the drinks, but it was actually very well timed and coordinated.  Anyway, I think The Perch might well be suited for smaller parties, but I would consider other options for larger ones.",

I was really craving for mimosas out on a patio so why not try out this place right?? We sat outside as the sun was starting to set... The service was a little slow in the beginning but they got it together after a while. They did let us know they had bad communication and what not but I wasn't bothered by it as my attention was with my date. So we ordered a bottle for making our own mimosas... Which is great cause my girlfriend doesn't like much OJ in her mimosas. So it's bang for your buck to sit and talk and sip on mimosas! We shared a ceviche, chicken quinoa and some fries. Food was really good! Didn't have any complaints there and Then immediately got suckered into an amazing vodka dessert! Overall great date night! Food tastes great! Live music ... Watched the sun set... Enjoyed every minute of it here! Thanks perch!",

    "text": "I'll try to make this as short as I can, but unfortunately my experience here wasn't so great. Yesterday night me and my friend went up to the bar and ordered 2 drinks, my friend had a mixed drink and I had an Iced tea (been sober for 2 years) one of the bartenders looks at me with a face of disgust like if by me ordering an ice tea makes me somehow less. I get my drink right away. My friend waited around 20 min and he was mad at the fact that they hadn't brought it to him, I kindly asked the bartender for the bill, he sarcastically told me to please wait since he was busy. Another bartender saw this and i guess felt bad and helped me out, he was really nice and this was the kind of service I expected from a beautiful place like this. We then left and as we where almost exiting the park the 1st bartender yells at us as he is running to catch up w us and tells us that we didn't pay, at this point I am vivid mad, so my friend kindly lets him know that we paid already. He then just leaves without even apologizing for the little scene he did.   Honestly I'm not one to complain but this guy ruined the night and the beautiful vibe in the place, I would like to give this place another try, only because there ARE workers there that know what good customer service is and the place is almost magical looking.",

    "text": "Great casual atmosphere with a view overlooking the Container Park. Waiter was VERY energetic and friendly (lots of comments and voices though).  Ordered calamari to start, but when the entrees showed up 20min later and I asked about my appetizer, waiter stated he thought he put it in, went to check, and came back apologizing that he didn't. No biggie, the rest of the food had come already and the service was good. The manager dropped by to also apologize and offer us a dessert instead - so we got the Creme Brulee. Between the 3 of us we ordered:  1. Perch Burger ($15)-  Med-rare order was cooked to med-well. 2 thin slices of fried green tomato were stiff and tasteless (sad bc I love fried green tomatoes). Bacon slices were some of the best bacon I've had in a while. Fries were good, aioli was fantastic.  2. Carpaccio  ($14) - weird that this was an entree but whatevs. meat was good, mashed potatoes were yellow from the sticks of butter in it, boys love it.  3. Bianca Flatbread ($12) + Prosciutto ($4)- Flatbread was smaller than I expected, but tasted good. prosciutto was super fatty and not great quality, ended up leaving it all on the side. 4. Complimentary creme brulee to make up for the no-show appetizer: So-so   Nothing I'd def order again. Wouldn't rush back here, despite lovely atmosphere. It's popular with my friends though and maybe it was an off day/I ordered wrong.",

It tasted good but nothing amazing that I would go back for.   The drinks were the part that I enjoyed. I had a glass of wine but I did see some cocktails I would like to try in the future.  My uncle ordered a bloody mary and it was served as a build your own bloody mary station. It had the alcohol, tomato juice and different toppings separated so you could make it as you see fit. I thought it was really awesome and would try that if I came back.   I feel like if I was to come here again I would just come for drinks and eat dinner elsewhere.",

It's inside container park so naturally it's a cute place, very bright inside. The staff was very friendly and it was a pleasant atmosphere. I ordered a couple mimosas and the egg biscuit plate. It was an extremely heavy dish so I was only able to eat about 1/3 of it before calling it quits. It was good but I don't know if I'd get it again, I'm a fan of poached eggs more than scrambled so eating scrambled eggs was an adjustment. I think if I want biscuits and gravy I'll stick to the real thing and not a breakfast version.  If I find myself downtown on a Sunday morning I'd definitely go back and try something else.",

The Brioche French Toast was AMAZING and the service was great. It is a very small place, and when we were there, a group of people at the bar was having a really good time which made the restaurant VERY loud. It was difficult to hear people at the same table. If the review was only on food and service, it would have been a 5. The atmosphere really does matter, and the noise level made what could have been a really enjoyable bunch a bad experience.

They were pretty busy and seemed bothered that I was asking the staff if they can please check to see if the waiter or bus boy picked it up. I asked a short girl, I am assuming  it was the hostess, to ask the server, she did but he could not recall seeing it. I was watching her asking him. She then walked passed me and did not even bother to say anything to me. I approached her and she said\" no one seen it\". I then walked up to the front check in and asked the girl what is the general rule Would they just toss it out or save it. She said no one turned in anything and continued to do her work. I then asked for the manager, at that point I was angry. I explained what happen and he looked at me as if saying to himself \"does this lady really want me to use my manager time to look for a cup\".  He walked away and came back and just put the cup on the counter in front of my face with out saying a thing. Really, how about saying something like \"we found the cup \". Or \"here is your cup\". I was made to feel as if I was not worthy of someone giving me their time. Next time I want to spend $90 on lunch I will somewhere else.",

The size of the restaurant is not very large and it can get pretty loud, especially with our boisterous group! The space itself is adorable with tons of natural light. Reservations for a large group was easy to make and our waitress was wonderful! She was on top of it with all of the drinks and had a great personality to boot. Everyone enjoyed their food and I didn't hear any complaints. I ordered the Smothered Egg Biscuits and it was tasty, but nothing special. I wish I ordered it with over medium eggs, but the dish comes to you automatically with scrambled (boo). Also, the cheese was not melted on top and the majority of my biscuit was hard (again, boo). However, the ambiance and service will more than made up for my mediocre dish.  Tip: There  is no taxi line for Container Park, so use Uber/Lyft to get back to the strip.",

You now order at the kiosk located at the bar which I was directed to by the amazingly rude server. Forgot his name but he was tall, black, bald & rude to SEVERAL people who dined there while I sat with my party. The other two female servers working that day were so sweet & tried to make up for his lack of home training. I appreciated them. Long story short, I hope they change back to how it was but if not, go there with food truck expectations. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Review based on a recent Sunday brunch visit.   Located in the far right corner of Container Park, The Perch sits on the 2nd floor overlooking the park & some of Downtown. It is a well lit, quaint little place to have a casual meal. We were sat right away at a community style table. My party consisted of the three of us, myself included.  The special going on was bottomless mimosas, bloody marys, & bellinis for a decent price.   What we ordered: -  chicken & waffles -  steak & egg tacos -  chorizo plate  I had the chicken and waffles. I was a bit put off by the amount of syrup they had poured on the waffle.. had I known that they do that- I would have asked to have the syrup separate because I am not a huge fan of having a lot of syrup on my waffle .. the fried chicken was crispy & somewhat flavorful. It just felt a bit lacking. It was just ok. There was a lot of chicken pieces though and the waffle was also prettty big. I probably wouldn't order this dish again though.  My friend told me the tortillas on her steak and egg tacos were straight up cold. And cracking - which means they weren't even warmed up or cooked properly.. she asked our waiter to rectify the situation & he kindly gave her a new plate. She also thought the dish could have been better.  As for the chorizo plate, it seemed to be a winner. A hefty portion and very filling.  The prices aren't too bad. Though personally, I would go somewhere else for brunch. The perch seems like a good place for lunch or dinner .. hoping to come back to try out those dishes.  Our waiter was very polite and kind, which I appreciated.",

Neither the food nor atmosphere justify the prices  Items ordered Perch Burger and Hanger Steak Sandwich to share.  Hanger Steak Sandwich with frites, $16: 1/5. Meat was flavorless and chewy, fries (sorry frites) were undercooked, baguette was tough and chewy.  Aioli just tasted like yellow mayo.    Perch Burger with frites, $15: 3.5/5.  thick cut bacon, breaded fried green tomato, provolone, Chipotle mayo.  The burger meat itself was bland, but the toppings were all very good.  Fries were also undercooked.  Service: 2/5. And that's being generous.",

I ordered the Chilaquiles and my daughter and friend ordered the Terrace Burger.  My Chilaquiles was supposed to have 2 eggs over easy. They were cooked way too long.  Hard crispy bottom with cooked yolk.  Server brought me 2 more, they weren't much better.  They brought them a 3rd time and they were finally cooked over easy.  Except by now tortilla chips were soggy.       The Terrace Burger was advertised as having a fried green tomato.  The tomatoes were just regular old red tomatoes.  When we told the server she brought out 2 friend green tomatoes, except one of them had absolutely no corn meal on it.  Burgers were ordered medium well and medium rare.  They were identical.  The cocktail that I had was great... the rest of the meal was truly a fail.",

    "text": "So we had intended to dine for brunch at the spot across the street from here, but were too impatient for the wait. So we strolled over to the next closest breakfast spot.  Here's how that went: the place was a bit scattered, with multiple entrances and wait staff attempting to find seating for the rush of customers.  We got a two seater next to the window, which is almost every seat, and were pretty uncomfortably hot throughout the meal.   Being hung over you want lots of refreshments and cold air conditioning, right!?! So the friendly waitress did come pretty quickly with juice and coffee and water -- thank the lord!   The menu was pretty limited and nothing sounded good and the plates coming out the kitchen didn't look appetizing. I was surprised to REALLY like the chkn and waffles, pretty darn delicious. And the food came pretty quickly too.  So -- all in all -- it wasn't the most comfortable spot. The wait staff was friendly and prompt. The kitchen did a great job with what they were working with. And it wasn't too overpriced by LV standards.  We'd go back, but probably not after a long Las Vegas night out!!",

We ordered the Chilaquiles, which was good, but of course the chips got soggy soon after, but still good! Wish the bad ad option with pulled pork, but the egg on top did it. Also ordered the Short Rib Hash and that was hands down the best! The meat cut like butter and melted in my mouth. Everything on that plate was good with an over-easy egg.   We sat at the bar where there were two TVs if you wanted to watch sports.  I'm sure if it were cooler outside, the patio would've been great for brunch.",

The TENDER short rib more than made up for it! Pretty sure I could've cut it with a spoon. Each individual component was done right and came together so well. Crispy Homestyle Potatoes, sauteed peppers, flavorful short rib. It's simple and just works. Surprisingly, filling without being heavy!!

Love the floor to ceiling glass windows and mid century inspired decor (that is the vibe I got). Met up with a group of friends for happy hour, but were not informed it was happy hour by our server until one of my friends mentioned it. No big deal though. We then got the \"happy hour menu\" which consisted of just very few choices of bites and drinks. We ended up ordering from both the happy hour menu and regular menu.   What we shared: order of fries, calamari and tuna poke nachos. All were served in generous platters and very tasty (but that's the truth with most fried foods). The vibe was very chill and laidback. Definitely a cool hangout spot.   I deducted a star for our server's persistence with wanting us to pay the bill. She kept coming over and over prompting us to pay  since her shift was going to be over. We got  annoyed with this since she came about it in a demanding way. We were having a great conversation and were repeatedly interrupted. Not cool. Other than that, everything was good!",

    "text": "Used to love this place when it was The Perch. Came here to eat at brunch and it was truly horrific.  So we get there and a fuss is made about us not having an extra person sit in what is technically a fire lane. Cool, not bad whatever. But we were clearly a nuisance to them based off of our service after that. Later on we saw them seat a two-top right in the middle of said fire lane.   Our server was awful. Not skill-wise but incredibly, incredibly rude. If you don't like to work around people and serve people, don't be a server. I'm a server. You have to actually be nice to people. She had a super rude tude when we asked to split checks (grabbed the bill without a response and walked away shaking her head laughing), calling out our friend super awkwardly who was just minding her business, and took cash on a bill without giving any change back after knowing we were all pretty much unsatisfied. She also over charged us on drinks when the bill was presented. She forgot things when we asked.   Also, hair was found in the frittata. The server took it away and said it looked like it was from an animal... which yknow probably wasn't the best thing to say to us as we sat horrified that the possibility of someone rubbing their dog all over a sad excuse for a frittata.   Brings me to the food! Fries were soggy, every poached egg was completely hard boiled (peep the pics) with every dish on the table, and instead of a frittata, their version is a GIANT omelette. Huge. Like a giant fried egg served on a plate alone. I wish we got a picture. It was not a frittata and was huge and served with nothing else. Just like a big fried egg on a plate. That's it. No one particularly loved their food (burger and short rib benedict's weren't bad though). One girl ordered the avocado toast and the poached egg on the side was hard boiled, and it was literally a piece of wheat toast with olives and unseasoned avocado. No seasonings or anything. And just one piece of bread.   On the way out, one in our party fell on a water puddle and slipped and not one employee asked if she was okay.   The best part was drinking during it so I could forget all about this place.",

Overall, the experience was pretty poor. We ordered two burgers. My burger was fine. My boyfriend's experience, on the other hand, was kind of insulting. My boyfriend has a gluten intolerant allergy, he asked if they have gluten buns, which they don't, however, the waiter said that they can sub. that with lettuce. That was fine with my boyfriend. My boyfriend also went with a well-done burger. The waiter scoffed at my boyfriend's cook on the burger and explained why he thought that wasn't a good idea. My boyfriend responded, that he just wanted the burger to be cooked and the waiter just said, \"Well, okaaaay\". The waiter might have been wanting to offer my boyfriend a better experience with the burger, but the way that he scoffed and tried to educate him in that manner, is not professional at all.   When the food came, my boyfriend's burger was not wrapped in a lettuce, but was a bed of shredded lettuce. This was not how it was described and who eats a burger with shredded lettuce? Even In-and-Out gives lettuce wrapped burgers! They also added a fried onion to his burger and it wasn't stated it was fried in the menu. When someone clearly says they can't eat the bun cause of the wheat, you think they'll check for other ingredients in the burger that has wheat...  The waiter was also very very slow and ignored us for a bit. Another waiter had to come help us get the bill cause our waiter was not attentive!",

The place itself is small, with a few tables along the top balcony so we had to wait for availability, even though there were lots of tables open (that day I was told they were short in kitchen staff). The view to the courtyard and stage was nice; fans blowing air & water was nice for the hot whether. The burger, according to my fiance, was the best he's had in Vegas. Sadly they were out of the salmon but I'm glad the lemon chicken was pretty amazing and the house wine was very good too. Their menu didn't have some of the items you see pictured here on yelp (don't know if it just changed over time), and waitress kept forgetting we were already checked in with her and asking us to move; however in a friendly way :) Yes, I would recommend",

Maybe it's just the brunch menu but the avocado toast (not pictured) was a piece of bread from a grocery store with guacamole on it? I could make it better and I would actually put avocado on it. The crab Benedict had hash browns that looked like they got it from a frozen bag from a store. Definitely not elegant how Benedict's normally look. The only amazing thing was the monkey bread - it was soooo good! I honestly think people love the bottomless drinks here then they think the food is good because they're tipsy.",

We sat at the bar because the only table available had too much traffic walking by it. The bar had comfortable seating. Our bartender & server Brandon greeted us and took our drink order while we looked over the menu.. He made a handcrafted margarita which was fantastic. I can't wait to go back to have another one..  We asked for suggestions and took him up on a few. We split the tuna tartar. Delicious! The menu said it was served with taro chips, however we got tortilla chips which were fine. Fortunately they were not salty, so they did not overpower the tuna. For entrees we got the Beef Carpaccio and Spicy Shrimp Pasta. The Carpaccio was served traditional with shaved parmesan and topped with Arugula and balsamic vinegar, perfect! The pasta dish was served with nice sized shrimp, pasta and a spicy cream sauce that was plate licking good. The dish has heat, but it was the kind that made you keep going back for more and more.  Only downside is that it would have been nice to eat on their patio, however there was a live band playing inside the park and the music was so loud, you would have not been able to hear yourself talk. Fortunately inside the music was not an issue at all. Looking forward to going back and hopefully have Brandon as our server. Awesome service!",

We decided to sit out on the deck where we could see the big screen that was playing music videos.  The wait staff was great!  My husband ordered the salmon and I ordered the steak and fries.  The salmon had some sort of green sauce on it...I think some sort of aioli and the steak had a garlic butter sauce and vinegrette on top. Both were so good.,especially the salmon! The margaritas came in a small glass, but they were not over priced and were delicious! I love this place...wish they had one in National Harbor, MD!!!! We will see The Perch on next year's vacation!!!",

The gentlemen behind the bar and the other gentlemen who was a server, treated our party like we were a burden to be there. When I pay for a service I expect good service or at least some courtesy. I did not receive that from those two gentlemen whose names I did not get. I food and drinks took a while to come out but we did not complain- but the horrible service is what tipped the scale.

Unfortunately the worst thing here is the the food!, it isn't cheap, and most of the portions are a bit small, but the worst thing is the shear lack of taste, as a party of six we ordered 4 starters and 6 main meals, all of them were bland, no seasoning at all. the fries were just long thin and soggy, 2 portions had salt on them and the others didn't. Very poor experience with clearly no consistency in the kitchen.  Would I recommend or return to eat there? no  but I would go in for a drink or 2.",

    "text": "In the first 10 days they've been open, we've been here for both lunch and dinner. It's been difficult to convince my husband to come to dinner in the Container Park in the past, but I don't think I'll have that problem any more!  I'd suggest sitting outside. It's cooled down enough that it's fine as long as you have an umbrella, and you'll get the background music of the stage without the clamor of other diners that one of the other reviews mentioned. Just don't sit at the couches unless you're planning to only have appetizers/desserts and drinks. The tables are too short for entrees.  Food: The potato puree that came with my husband's beef carpaccio was so good that he, literally, created a wall of drinking glasses to prevent me from taking bites of it. His chicken paillard was good, but not great. I've had salads both times, the Onassis the first time (great big slab of feta!) and the Perch the second time. The Perch was good, but I liked the Onassis better.   Service: We've had incredibly attentive service both times, and making reservations with Yelp's service is really easy. When we went for lunch on Saturday, we met friends, and my Perch salad came out after their entrees, so our waitress comped my gin fizz. It wasn't a significant delay, but it was long enough to order and receive the drink, so it was very much appreciated.",

The food is high quality and affordable, the drinks are well prepared, but mostly the service is utterly incredible. From chefs to servers to bartenders, every member of the staff goes out of their way to ensure your trip was worth it. If you want a treat, go during the early afternoon shift with Stefan the bartender, Blair the manager, and the server Brandon. I promise you won't regret it. You'll feel like family.

The place is small and far from quiet, and after being asked to quiet down once we were ushered out. The staff asking other customers to complain about our group specifically is petty and ridiculous, and we're disappointed to lose one of our go-to brunch spots.",

    "text": "Went with large group last week for a birthday and they were very accommodating. The service was prompt , the space is very cute and the prices quite reasonable. This is certainly a welcome addition to the neighborhood and I will definitely be back.   The cocktails were creative and generally pretty good and the beer and wine list had a nice selection for sure.   The food was sort of a mixed bag unfortunately but it was their first week so I'm definitely willing to cut them some slack. Hopefully my thoughts below will be somewhat constructive.   Small Plates: The Salmon Tiradito was great as were the Tuna Tartare and Beef Tartare. For the price I'd say the beef tartare is some of the best I've had in Vegas.   The crabcakes on the other hand were pretty wretched. It was hard to identify more than a shred of crab meat in them. It seemed they were composed almost entirely of a filler of some sort and they had the consistency of an undercooked biscuit. The seasonal pickles were similarly hard to enjoy as they were so salty they were basically inedible. They were clearly home-made so I'm hoping it was just a bad batch that no one in the kitchen actually tried this particular jar. It would be better to pull them from them menu for a week while a new batch was made than serve something this salty. The Beet Carpaccio was decent but the acidity of the lemon juice was a bit overpowering and it could have used something to balance it out.   Flat Breads:  The Belle was superb and the kitchen had taken the time to properly caramelize the onions which was very much appreciated and not often done. The Lucia was also very nice with a flavorful sausage on top and I'm not typically a big sausage fan. The Cecilia however was a bit of a miss for me. The seared tuna just didn't play well with the acidity of the capers, olives and tomato sauce.   Large Plates: The Hanger Steak Sandwich was a damn good sandwich. Cooked to temperature and smothered with their wonderful caramelized onions with a dollop of aioli. The grilled Salmon wasn't quite so hot. The fish itself was moist but the brussel sprouts a bit soggy and the flavors of the salsa didn't quite work with the fish or the vegetables.   All in all an enjoyable evening but I think they would be well served to scale down their menu. Right now there are just too many dishes that aren't working.",

    "text": "The Perch; give it some time and they will get things right, I feel, because they really seem to care about their business.   Let's get to the grub, in order of appearance:  Crab cakes...nearly all filler, and not all that flavorful to make up for the lack of crab. I would suggest passing on this unless they change the recipe to include more crab (not krab, please!).  Salmon entree was pretty good and cooked to the temperature requested; a good portion for the price paid, but what really made this dish stand out are the Brussel sprouts...ask for those with any other entree; they're that good.  Chicken entree was thin and not all that flavorful but a decent portion. This entree came with a salad that had a fantastic vinaigrette (I believe) but the leaves were too roughage-like for me and somewhat bitter.   Creme brulee was done nicely and what you'd expect; it's hard to screw up custard with caramelized sugar.   The highlight of the meal was the tiramisu. This was fantastic and not over-done in the rum department as most places do. I will go back for this alone, with maybe a cordial to wash it down since they have a full bar as well.   Ambiance: If it's busy, as it was on my visit, it's far too loud in this small space due to a lack of acoustical panels or other noise dampening decor.  Yes, I understand I'm sitting in a 'storage container', but several things can be done to make the space not so harsh. That annoys me while dining out more than bad service. Please look into taming down the space considerably.   Service: Excellent from both the server and the manager who checked on the table twice. From the minute I walked in I felt like all staff truly cared about the patrons. They were happy to be there; that makes me happy to be there too.   Overall it's worth a stop by if you're in the area since the dining options (that I would recommend at least) are somewhat limited on East Fremont. Make suggestions if you do go; I feel this establishment may actually listen.",

However, my husbands \"hash\" was firstly not a \"hash\" at all. It was basically 20 cents of food that they charge you 9 dollars for. A potato chopped and fried with a poached egg on top. My egg whites was basically a frittata and the \"bacon\" was more like ham. Avocados weren't ripe.   Overall we ate all our food because we were hungry, But I'll never go back there again.  On top of that they close their kitchen for an hour and \"keep the bar open\" bar tender made sure to tell all the parents with their kids looking for a meal that they could order drinks......

All the food was good AF!! Cool idea on the bacon flights and to take it to another level, I would do a bigger thicker slice of bacon. For 6 bucks, I could have made that at home (still delicious though). I had te burger protein style and it was perfectly cooked (medium rare). Great flavor with the chipotle mayo which is freshly made and the fried green tomato is a great addition. It seemed like they were understaffed today and that didn't slow them down one bit. having the chefs come out to serve and bus tables was a testament to how cohesive they all are as a team. I definitely plan to come back and have more of the menu items!",

Heard about this opening and so glad we went.  Service and food were amazing!  Plus it's so cute! It was a perfect night to dine outside.  And while no happy hour, the prices are very reasonable.  We had 2 flatbreads which were both really good.  One with quail egg, spinach abs cheese, so yummy!  The other was a shrimp, cilantro and bean one, also very delicious.  Fries with garlic aioli was my fav, I will crave these and must go back!  The wine was perfectly chilled as we'll and everyone who greeted and served us was super nice! Definitely going back, will be a regular :)",

I had never hear of the place, but it was the only place that we could find that could get our large group in that day; so, we decided to give it a try. Located at Downtown Container Park - what a fun location! I would rate this place semi family-friendly - in that they have high chairs available, a few (limited) menu options for kids. Beyond that, the servers tolerated the children in the restaurant but did not seem overly thrilled to have them as guests. There were not any offerings for the kids - activity pages, etc. Which is totally fine, because we always bring our own just in case. The Easter Brunch menu (and not sure if this differs from their weekly brunch menu) is limited. I wasn't particularly hungry so I went with the seasonal fruit plate (can't go wrong there) & bottomless mimosas for $15. Those in our party that did eat were happy with their meals and everyone had leftovers, so the proportions were enough.  We would go back but not without trying other brunches offered throughout the city first.",

Plus they have $15/all you can drink Mimosas/Bloody Mary's/ Bellinis, which if you like to drink you can easily take advantage.  The view out the back of the bar is unreal, all these storage containers makeup other stores, bars & restaurants, I'd describe it as a contemporary concrete jungle. It's really intriguing.

For the next 10 minutes...tik tok tik tok... no one ever came to our table and asked for our order? I kept looking around and found so many employees on a small establishment but yet no one can ever keep up the guests? I could even serve guest by myself only with that small establishment. Soon, an employee passed by and I grabbed him and told him our order and he said.. Sorry, I am not your waiter but what do you want? Well, nobody paid attention to us??? So if he is not the waiter but can he just HALLER???? to anyone? So he took our order and then tik tok tik tok for another 15 mins. our order still not coming and yet the people right after us got already their order before us?? Umm time to stand up and walked away!!!   To the management of The Perch... Please... look around your establishment...It is not hard to keep up with your customer.

The vegetables were really good especially the brussel sprouts, the salmon was seasoned very well. I also ordered pizza for the kids, they said it was good but the edges were a little too hard for them to bite.  I had a side salad but for 4.00 the portion was entirely too small. Overall everything was decent and I would definately order from them again but next time I think I will visit the resturant and eat there instead.",

They did! They immediately put a sign on the table us, called, and had to send people away (almost sent me away not knowing I was part of the group). My husband enjoyed their bottomless house red wine (he likes dry reds) and though I started out ordering one Bloody Mary they let me switch to bottomless after I ordered a second. Our waitress was very attentive, personable, offered her favorites when asked for suggestions, and made sure we were well taken care of. The crane asada fries came out a little undercooked for medium rare but they were willing to take it back. It was fine for us and super delicious! The fried chicken strips were great! Not greasy or over-breaded like many places. The pot stickers were good too. We had a corner table for four by the door, and were able to people watch the live music and event outside. Super pleased with the service, food, and atmosphere!",

If not, be prepared to wait downstairs first then take the elevator up to the bar.   There's an amazing view of la! This is the perfect spot to take out of towners. This was my go to spot in dtla!!",

I would have definitely given this place 4-5 stars if the service wasn't so slow and they didn't run out of things. Someone in our party got a bottomless bloody mary for $15, had one and they ran out. After making a deal out of it, they took it off the bill. All that said, their mary and food were amazing. It's a foodie place that takes extra care to incorporate lots of flavor into everything. Entrees seemed more ala carte though, and portions are small. Might not be the best place for someone with a  big appetite. The atmosphere is open and airy. It was fun watching people build things out of the oversized legos downstairs.",

    "text": "Truly as good as it gets! This is my new favorite place for al fresco dining in Vegas.  The Perch perfectly bridges the gap between high-end \"fine dining\" and \"a casual evening out\". The food is what you'd hope to find at any great restaurant, but the vibe is European cafe casual.  Outstanding service.  Our server, Dante was awesome. Friendly and having a comprehensive knowledge of the menu; he was able to offer excellent recommendations. Food was served promptly, but service was not rushed.  Outstanding Food.  Our Calamari appetizer was great - with an unusual but delightful dipping sauce. My date had the Salmon - served over brussel sprouts (which he instantly declared to be the best he'd ever had).    I had the Turkey French Dip - just 'cause it sounded interesting. It was better than I had hoped - with a delicious dressing that involved caramelized onions and a little horseradish. It was served with truly killer French fries.  Yeah, I could eat my weight in those.  Outstanding overall experience. A perfect evening at a charming restaurant with a fantastic staff.   One consideration: Be aware of whether or not there is a band on the nearby stage when choosing to sit inside or out. The night we were there, the duo \"Orange Feathers\" was playing. Talented guys, and they kept it to a reasonable level. However, it would be easy for things to get overly loud if you are sitting near the speakers.  Fair Disclosure: I had an earlier experience here that ended in us bailing out due to issues with staffing. On this, my second visit, they more than made up for that earlier snafu.   At any business, things can happen that are truly beyond control. Sudden rushes; staffers bailing, supplies not coming in - it happens. What is important is *how* the establishment handles these unexpected moments.   General Manager, Kristine has my total respect and admiration for her diplomatic and friendly response to my initial concerns. Well done, and Thank You!  I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "A few weeks ago, I had Sunday brunch at The Perch. The restaurant is presumably so named because it is perched on the second story overlooking Container Park. Befitting its location though, the entire restaurant seemed like more of an idea than a thing of substance.  The restaurant has communal seating of the type one might expect at a southern German beer garden. Unlike the sturdy tables at the beer garden, ours had a mossy ditch running down the center which caused another patron to upset her mimosa right onto my friend's lap.  We started off sharing some monkey bread, which was the best monkey bread I ever had - moist, saucy & delicious. The menu is rather limited and the prices won't set you back much. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. Because they had no eggs Benedict, I had to break my streak of reviewing the eggs Benedict everywhere I go, and I ordered a burger instead. The vegan in our party tried to order a fruit plate, just to find out they were \"out of fruit plates,\" and Mark tried to order the steak & eggs, only to find out that the steak could only be cooked well done.  I suspect that the fiasco that was my burger was the product of poor quality ingredients, sloppiness & probably some witless ideas. The burger comes with maple bacon, something that aspires to Emmentaler cheese, and a fried green tomato that hadn't a single hoot left to give. It was supposed to come with chipotle mayonnaise, but was in fact served in a state of undress, so I used my friend's garlic aioli instead. The garlic aioli and maple bacon disagreed with each other, but I'd be willing to bet that combining the maple bacon with chipotle mayonnaise would not be much better a plan. The burger wasn't seasoned properly, if at all, and the fried green tomato tasted like the flavorless fried cornmeal mush that is so popular in Appalachia. The fries were decent, as was the service.  Overall, I have to conclude that The Perch is not worth the trip.",

My friends and I went and were left for 20 minutes sitting with nobody checking on us. After the waitress kept us waiting for 20 minutes she finally took out order and the long 40 minute wait for my mediocre french toast began. When I politely asked the waitress when the food was coming out she replied with \"it will come when it comes\". I politely pointed out the long wait for 4 orders of French toast and her response was \"we are a small operation not a corporation\" in a very rude way. As if her rude comments were not enough she then passively aggressively told my friends that we have only been waiting for 30 minutes for our food since the order -- as if that was an acceptable thing. If you want polite waiters/waitresses and good food this is definitely not the place to go.  Worst dining experience of my life.",

Secondly because of its location this means the place is tiny but that by no means takes away from the ambience!!! We came here with no reservations so we had to wait just under an hour for a table for four!  Once we sat down they put a bottle on the table. I mean what is brunch without bottomless mimosas ?  $15 per person which is more than affordable! The service was a little bit on the slower side because they are so busy but still very attentive in that none of our orders were mixed up.   The food was amazing. I had the chicken and waffles, friend had the shrimp and grits, wife had the French toast so everything was up to par. We had a great time and the executive Chef took care of us.  This place is a must go for Vegas locals and I will be sure to return!!! Thank you all for the amazing experience.",

We stumbled on The Perch by accident and since it had a lot of good reviews we decided to check it out. Fortunately for me, there was a Check-In Special where you get a free 4oz. of beer with your first check in and I opted for the Victory beer which was a super delicious wheat ale. The brunch menu was not too vast, and I ended up eyeballing The Terrace, which is described as a dish with corn, chimichurri, shrimp, and I think tomatoes. For some reason I expected greens or something underneath it but the bulk of the dish was corn and chimichurri, which isn't the end of the world by any means.   The plate smelled delicious when it came out, and it initially tasted delicious, but after four or five bites the garlic and onion flavors were so overwhelming that I had already begun to apologize to my boyfriend because I knew I was going to reek of garlic for the days to come. If you don't have a problem with a huge amount of raw garlic in your brunch meal, then by all means opt for The Terrace. If you want to continue smelling delightlfully ambiguous then do yourself a favor and get the french toast which is really really freaking good. I got to take a bite of my boyfriend's french toast and I almost stole his dish away from him...",

    "text": "I can't imagine a worse restaurant in downtown Las Vegas or anywhere than this place. My friend ordered a lemon chicken and the chicken breast was so small and tough and dry and disgusting. I ordered the carne asada fries, the carne asada was tough and dry the fries were all stuck together with the cheese and that was partly because our server let our food stand and wait for a long time before I finally said hey we ordered 30 minutes ago where's our food, she blamed it on a big rush of customers. Well if you're been there the place is not that big there's no way in heck there was a big rush of customers I looked around myself. So besides the food being totally awful the service the worst ever and for what we paid I would never never recommend you going back there. I read some other person's review that said the food was great they must have been paid to write that review because this place totally stinks",

This was a bit off-putting but we didn't argue and sat inside.  It took quite a long time for the waiter to take our order and another 40 minutes to get our food.  In that time, the patio table we had originally requested remained empty.  When we inquired into our food, the waiter told us they had a small kitchen and two large tables sat down at the same time we did.  Owner of The Perch - a problem on your part shouldn't constitute a problem on your patrons and a kitchen that can't accommodate a half full restaurant is a problem.  When we were ready to pay our bill, we finally had to go up to the counter and find the waiter as, even though we had our credit cards clearly sitting on the table showing our readiness to pay, he kept walking by.  I will say, one good point was my food, the steak and egg tacos, were quite good and the waiter did give us a 25% discount for the slow kitchen service and GM refusing to sit us where we requested.",

We had the tuna tartare served with deliciously delicate taro root chips that I want bags of on hand at all times, and beef carpaccio with a unique addition of creamy potato puree where we practically licked the plate. After the high quality of those dishes we had to try the beef tartare which was prepared beautifully and also delicious. We also tried the spiced nuts which had a perfect balance of sweet and heat that kept you reaching back for more. A neighboring diner was so in love with her crab cakes she insisted that we try those and those were also tasty with a crunchy slaw that added a texture I usually find lacking in a crab cake. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and had the right amount of attentiveness. There was also a fun and interesting beer list offered. I personally can't wait to go back.  Good food is my favorite thing in the world, and you can tell this chef loves what he does.",

Almost a year since the first review and this place has completely changed for the worse. The energy was so DEAD that two of our group left to go eat elsewhere. We stayed. Service was fast from the bar so no complaints there and the menu has stayed the same. Husband got the turkey burger again but he said it was just mediocre this time. Looking at the brunch specifics and I'm pretty sure this is the only place in town that has a 2 hour bottomless time limit. Plus there's a menu on the back wall about creating your own margarita. And people are given the option of gin, vodka, etc? I'm sure that's a disaster for the bar tender especially when the drink comes out and it tastes horrible because the majority public wouldn't know how to make a margarita if their lives depended on it. (Hint: margaritas are generally made with tequila) was happy to see this place stay since the turnover in there is ridiculous but now I'm not so sure.",

We didn't get a full meal, just drinks and a light snack but it was a cute, small place with a nice atmosphere overlooking the container park. I would definitely say it's worth it to walk around the park and stop in here for some great drinks and appetizers.",

He didn't even ask if we wanted another cocktail which is very disappointing since they were great. It's not always about the food that keeps people coming back it's the experience..",

The drinks are a little on the pricey side. Although it's small I've never had to wait for a table, I've never seen this place super busy. They also have outside seating that overlooks the inside of the container park. The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 is the service I got one time when I went in the morning right when they opened, they seemed annoyed that I walked in 1 minute before their technical open time, and made me go back outside for literally 60 seconds before I could come back in... even though the door was unlocked and they were just standing and talking. Other than that, I love this place and their food!",

We had the Terrace salad which is made of corn, tomatoes, chimichurri sauce and topped with perfectly cooked shrimp.  We also had the short rib hash with a mushroom demi glaze...it was delicious.  The atmosphere is cheerful, bright, clean, modern, not overdone.  The service was probably the best part.  Nora, made recommendations and shared a bit about what was happening downtown, and there was another server whose name we didn't get and she was also wonderful.

Two different tables walked in after us and got their food before we did. We ordered a Bruschetta appetizer and a steak sandwich medium rare. Very unorganized and short staffed. Michael the bartender was very rude. Not only did it take asking 2 different people and 20 mins to get one 4 oz beer but they brought plates and silverware after we ate our app. After we told Michael to forget the order and just bring our bill for the bruschetta and drinks he rudely remarked \"it was because we ordered an appetizer that it took so long for our food?\" Lol then took his sweet time getting our bill and ended up having to go inside to pay. Over all BAD experience and would not ever recommend this too place to anyone!",

My husband had the most delicious Bloody Mary, and we've had our share of them at various Vegas locations. I had the Blueberry Mojito and it was also fantastic. They have a cute little lounge-type area outside with couches and tables with small lamps.  The night we were out was a bit cold, but it was perfect for cuddling and people watching. We had a great view of the park and the children's play area. This place is located in the Container Park in Downtown Vegas. Just look for the huge flaming praying mantis out front and go right in. It's free to get in.  You just can't take in or take out alcohol.",

First the host seemed like it was his first day bc he only wanted to offer me bar seating. However I was wearing a dress and meeting a girlfriend so that was not an option. Ultimately he spoke to another employee who told him to split up some of the other tables and seat us.   Upside was the next service employee we dealt with (our server) was nice and fairly attentive. She provided us with recommendations when asked since it was our first time eating at Perch. However she gave so many options we still had a hard time narrowing things down.   Now on to the food... This is the reason that score is so low. Its was mediocre unfortunately. I had the infamous Perch burger and it was not that fabulous. I felt it was somewhat bland to have a fried green tomato on it.   Overall, the ambiance of the location is cute and very fresh. I think if i came back it would be for appetizers and drink perhaps. Wish i could say more good things but thats all folks!",

Upon entering the restaurant, the staff seemed reluctant to sit us outside. It was twice suggested that we just dine at the bar. If outdoor seating was unavailable, then sure - but we were eventually sat at a booth outside.   Wait staff was inconsistent and confused. Being a pescatarian, I ordered the shrimp salad and a side of fries. I was delivered a cobb salad with bacon. Not realizing our second waiter had put the order in incorrectly, I took a few bites.   I would've told either of the random assortment of waiters \"tending\" to us, of the mistake and requested a replacement, but there wasn't follow up until it was time for us to pay the bill. I actually had to ask that he remove the item from our receipt...like I would've paid for a salad, with meat, that I couldn't eat?!   This place is cute, but not cute enough. Food on previous visits has been decent. Try Vegenation, Simply Pure, Glutton, or Therapy for quality downtown dining.",

They had a large party and the kitchen was backed up....  I absolutely love this.   So much better to know I'm waiting for a table and will have great service,  than to order and wait a long time for your food..   And when we did sit down?  Great service and no long waits for food!!   I love honesty!!   So,  first the staff...  Amazing,  attentive, and super friendly.   Very personable.   It was like friends were waiting on you.   And the food?  Wow..  That's all I can say.   I had the salmon, and I've had plenty of good salmon in my life,  but this was amazing!  My friend had the steak and fries and devoured it,  it was that good.   Then,  dessert...   So my friend got the cheesecake and I got the creme brulee..  Even if I can't spell it,  lol,  I definitely ate it!  So good.   The cheesecake was frozen...  Now,  here's the cool part.   Before we could say anything,  our waiter came up and said he found out the cheesecake was frozen, and apologized.   And..  He offered to replace it with something else for free, AND give a to go container for the cheesecake!  We declined the additional dessert, and another person came to make sure we didn't want to take that offer.   Talk about service!!   Food was great,  but the staff made the entire experience amazing.   They were very impressive.   Before leaving they told me they do brunch on the weekends..  You will definitely see me there!

They only take reservation for 8 or more so I had made one for 8 people earlier that morning. Our group ended up being only 7. There were only 4 people in the restaurant when we arrived at 7:50 and we told them we would wait at the bar for the rest of our party to make sure we didn't take up more room than necessary. They didn't love this idea but I thought this was better than taking up too much room. The restaurant is quite small.   We ordered some drinks at the bar which took a little bit to prepare even though there were 3 bartenders and only 4 people in the restaurant. We sat down at our table and ordered some additional drinks and our food within 10 minutes of sitting.   The restaurant did start to pick up and most of the tables became full. 30 minutes later and 2 of us still didn't have our drinks. We asked for them again and he apologized and brought them right away. The food took a long time as well. Close to an hour to get our food and it came out in shifts. 2 people got their meal then 4-5 minutes later another 2 people got their meal and so forth....it seemed a little strange that not everyone was served within just a minute or 2 of each other. I understand a person only has 2 hands but having worked in restaurants when there is a table of 7 you ask another server to help take out the plates.   Overall, the drinks were good, location great, but subpar service. I've heard wonderful things about their brunch so hopefully I can have a better experience with their service then!",

Our party of 2 enjoyed the Tuna Tartare with Taro Chips, the Chicken & Quinoa, and the Salmon with Brussel Sprouts and Asparagus.  Each of the dishes was very enjoyable and just about perfectly prepared.  My only feedback would be that it would be nice to have slightly more seasoning on the Tuna Tartare (perhaps garnish with Maldon Salt) and I would use slightly less butter with the quinoa.  Our bill for three fantastic dishes was only $49 plus tip.  Our server was super friendly, agreed right off the bat with our choices, and even helped us relocate outside in mid-meal when some patio tables opened up because the weather was perfect outside on a Saturday evening around 9pm and inside was a little too chilly for our liking.  Avalon Landing was playing right outside on the Container Park main stage, and everything about our experience was top notch.  I'm sorry I didn't come check this place out months ago, but I will definitely be back often.  I did not like the taste of their filtered tap water though, so I might consider ordering one of their many choices of artisanal bottled waters next time.",

Everything on the menu is at least twice as expensive as it should be. Expect to stare at a plate of food that seems less than generous - on purpose. You will be irked.  The Steak Frites ($18) is served with a New York Strip - what a terrible, flavorless choice. The fact that they chose to *not* go with the Hanger Steak (which happens to appear in one of their sandwiches) is indicative of how stingy the people running this place are. I don't know anybody that would choose a New York Strip as their 'favorite' cut of beef. Pass.  The Power Greens ($11) salad is a cruel joke. Comes out looking like way less than a half-portion. Like meant-for-hamster-consumption-small. Appears to be less than $1 in ingredients with an 1100% markup. Should be $5.50 at the most.  The Flatbreads ($9-$13) are shamefully small. 4 *tiny* pieces of flatbread = the equivalent of one single slice of Brooklyn pizza. Should be $4.50-6.50 at the most.  Only suckers should eat here. I left The Perch feeling cheated and mad. The 6 of us also waited over 35 minutes for our food to come out. That's a long wait for a business lunch. The server apologized but offered no compensation. What a waste of time. Nobody likes wasting restaurant dollars. What a terrible value.  Currently the most overrated restaurant Yelp listing in Vegas. You've been warned! The actual environment is clean and fresh. Some table seating involves back-less stools which is a bit informal and potentially uncomfortable, but for the most part the interior design was pleasing. But alas, it's like a Four Seasons lobby with a truck-stop Knights Inn lurking in the back. (the Lurch?)  I'm sure there are a few more one or two-star reviews coming their way. It is inevitable.",

    "text": "I had dinner at The Perch on 8/7, a pretty busy Friday night. We sat outside and we were seated promptly.    They took quite a while to take our order, but it was busy, so that's understandable.Once we placed our order, it took kind of a while to get the food out.  Like a long while.  It is too bad that the service was so slow. Our server was great and kept checking on us, so I think the problem was with the kitchen.  It would have been nice if they had offered us bread or something.   I would have given them four stars, because my salad, The Terrace, was freaking delicious, but they made a couple of mistakes in addition to the SLOW service. It was a great salad with fresh roasted corn, heirloom tomatoes, a slightly spicy chimichurri dressing, and four shrimp. Maybe in a $15 salad they could have gone with 5-6 shrimp.  It was still more than I could finish though, so no big deal.   Mistake #1 - The brought out my dinner about 10 minutes before my friend's dinner. That was weird and awkward. We just sat and looked at it. Good thing it was a salad, so I didn't have to worry about it getting cold.   Mistake #2 - My salad was supposed to have avocado, and it didn't.  If it is on the menu but not on the plate, they should explain when you order that they are out of whatever it is.   I would go back, but I wouldn't rush back.",

We visited close to sunset on a hot summer Sunday and snagged the sofas on the balcony, right above the park. A fantastic spot for out of Towner's like us to drink in the funky vibe of Container Park.  The kids ordered the cheese pizza (elongated) and the shell hair pasta with grilled chicken and baby Brussels sprouts. My wife's had the lettuce cups with steak, and I opted for the veggie burger.  Our meal was delicious, as was the house bloody mary. This cafe is a hidden, 5-star gem. If you're looking for a chill taste of Downtown LV, you can't do much better.",

You can check out other little spots in the container park!  I feel the need to add this part to my review:  They are a fairly new spot, and were giving out a tiny quick questionnaires with your bill. I quickly filled it out and handed it in. When I returned from my vacation a day later I had an email directly from the manager. Mind you, it was not a boring generated email, like an actual answer to my suggestions. WOW!

Once entering, up the stairs to the right, the bartenders were super nice and immediately wiped the outdoor, shadier table off for us.  I'm not a sun person, but very much enjoy the outdoors.    The server took awhile like the last time we were here.  She asked if we were eating and was rude.  However, Stephen, the bartender was very nice and took over after that.  He did not know the name of the new bubbly Rose, or that they were out of the Blue Moon, instead brought dad a citrus draft beer, which he did not like.  He ordered a Heineken instead.    Dad had to use the restroom, which is 'downstairs next to the toy store' but is actually downstairs around the corner with a security guard.  I guess we are downtown and rather be safe than sorry.    A couple of things that really stuck out in Jeff C. and my mind about our first time here... slow service, upset customers, nothing spectacular on the menu and a fishy smell.    At the time, I didn't want to Yelp about it because I expected more and would be back soon.  The patio seating, view, relaxing and entertaining outdoor area ... besides the meter maid giving out over four tickets that we couldn't believe watching!  There is also a colorful yellow hallway with local Vegas artwork, overlooking a playground, stage area and people that were on a scavenger hunt.  Fun and great location!    Unfortunately, it was the same experience and scenario overall.  Stephan was great!  Service before him was slow, nothing on the 'Sharable' menu looked great via Yelp reviews, but when that same fish came out at the table next to us, we lost our appetite... once again.    Second time here, someone ordered fish and it stunk up the outdoor patio!  I mean my parents said let's go home and eat trying to be nice.",

Our server told us that they just recently made that switch. So we just ordered coffee to warm up and decide if we were saying or going. We stayed and I'm glad we did.  I got the chicken sandwich. It came on a really tasty, toasted roll and had pesto and other yummy stuff. Lisa got the salad and had steak with it instead of the shrimp that came with it. It was fantastic.

As we walked in we did not get seated or acknowledged until we ASKED the server do we sit ourselves or do we get seated? She quickly threw our menus on the table and said \"I'll be back.\" Well 3 other couples walked in and they were greated and sat down. 10 minutes past and still no one came by and asked us what we wanted to drink or eat but the other couples that walked in were already served with drinks. Another 5 minutes passed we got up and walked out also we were the only Hispanic couple in that place and I believe it played a huge factor in why we didn't get served! I've never felt so discriminated in my life... not even worth the one star I had to give to write this review!! This all happened 2/16/19 at around 1pm",

    "text": "Ok so this is the absolute cutest little breakfast and brunch spot I've seen in a while. It's nestled at the end of Fremont street (aka the \"old Vegas\" apparently), but so worth it to go to! Forget the craziness of the strip, this place is my new favorite!   My best friend and I were meeting a friend for brunch, and after searching for places, we all agreed to come to The Perch, since other Yelpers posted that they had bottomless mimosas (yay!) ***By the way, it's not just bottomless mimosas... They have bottomless Bellini's and Bloody Mary's too. And you can mix and match them... As in, if you order a mimosa and then want a Bellini instead, that's fine***   We arrived around 11am on a Sunday, and it wasn't too crazy busy... yet. Our server, Jessica, was super on point and extremely sweet! She was so helpful, sincere and genuine, it made our experience so much better. We each saw a few things on the menu that caught our attention (other than the bottomless drinks), and we asked Jessica which item she'd recommend and she pointed us in the right direction -- and neither of us were disappointed.   My best friend and I both ordered the Brioche French Toast -- pure deliciousness! And our friend got the Egg White Omelet. And we had drinks for daaaaayyyssss at our table. Jessica came to check on us and I jokingly asked her to bring over a whole bottle of champagne for us -- and she did -- plus the mixers!!! Such amazing service! Needless to say, we were happy campers (or brunchers, whatever).   As we were paying, we noticed we still had some champagne left and again, the jokester that I am, asked Jessica if we could have the rest of the champagne to-go... and to my surprise/shock, she said yes! The only thing is that you can't leave the little complex The Perch is in but you can still walk around and enjoy the scenery, and if you have little ones, there's a play area for them.   Overall this was an amazing experience (thanks, Jessica!!!), and the food was phenomenal!!! Next time I'm back in Vegas, this place is a definite MUST! Oh, and be sure to pay enough for the darn parking if you drive/park your car there, otherwise you end up with a $20 parking ticket. SMH",

The food is fresh, the cocktails are delicious and the view isn't to shabby either. Because this is basically an insulated box, the A/C stays in and keeps this place feeling cool and comfortable.  My last visit had me sitting at the bar and enjoying a beer during a business meeting, we started with the fried calamari to share and the I chose, \"The Egg\" for lunch. The fried calamari is a great starter, your basic calamari with a light breading, but the sauce is what makes it pop, order extra because this stuff goes fast.   \"The Egg\" is a hearty salad that will fill any empty feeling you might get from reading the word \"salad\" on the menu. A poached egg, butter lettuce, frisee lettuce, bacon, croutons, Sherry Vinaigrette. This is a great lunch option that won't leave you feeling heavy and tired, the butter lettuce is different and something that you don't see on most salads. Plus who doesn't like a poached egg and bacon on a salad!   PRO TIP: Happy Hour is the best way to break your Perch cherry. Two-dollars off cocktails and five-dollar beer and wine offered.",

    "text": "I will say if I am writing a review just based on the food and food alone, I would give this place 4 stars.   The reason for the lower stars is due to incredibly bad service we received. I came here on a Saturday morning (originally on going somewhere close by but there was a wait) we got seated immediately which was nice for a larger party.   When we sat down we ordered drinks they do have all you can drink for 15 dollars (bloody marys, mimosa or belinis) and you can change them around. The bloody marys tasted like tomato juice, no flavor or spice.   We ordered our food within 10 minutes of seating and then about 30 minutes later the server came and told me that the potatoes that I had requested without bell pepper were pre cooked with bell pepper and they can sub it with fries. I had said that was fine. After waiting an additional 30 minutes. (total of 1 hr after ordering) the server came and said it will be a few minutes before our food is ready. I asked if there was something they can provide us due to the long wait. The server stated they can bring us a fruit platter as we have been waiting for such a long time.   We waited another 20 minutes and asked for a manger because at this time we were really upset for the length of time it was taking to get our food. We finally got the manager and he stated was coming out now.... we still had to wait another 20 minutes ( making it 1hr and 40 minutes by the time we ordered and 1 hr and 50 minutes from when we sat down). we notes the time as we had marked in metered parking.  When we addressed the situation with the manager he stated he would provide a 10% discount to the bill. He was arguing with us about the amount of time it took to bring the food out.   The location, the view and food was amazing but the service and management was lacking. On top of everything they charged for the fruit plate they brought us, I had to bring it to their attention to have them take it off. I might come back here on a date or 1 on 1 but large parties beware.",

My Beef hash was the best dish, chicken and Waffles had good chicken, but the waffle was a little soft and there was nothing to go with it like a veggie or fruit to be seen.  But $15 bottomless mimosas/bloody mary's is the proper way to start a vegas saturday.",

There were five of us that went for brunch and we decided to take advantage of family dining and all you can drink. What a brilliant idea! Thankfully, with all you can drink....you can switch it up! Want a Bloody Mary...here you go! Want to try the Mimosa next....enjoy!   We decided on the Mimosas in the end....so our wonderful server Mike (he's super tall, you can't miss him) brought us a Champagne Bottle and a carafe of juice! Thank you Mike for knowing your audience!   The food was delicious! The group was a mix of meat and non meat eaters; and they had no problems tending to our needs. We shared the grits, monkey bread, fruit plate, hash browns, short ribs hash, and berry crepes....I stuck to the vegetarian friendly items...and I loved them! Everything was expertly crafted with flavour, visual appeal, and over all perfection. I would not have changed a single thing about this brunch!   I plan to make this a regular spot for my ladies brunches and Mike must be our server every time!! He even took a photo of all of us (making sure to get a few, in different angles...so we would be happy with our options!)   I highly recommend Downtown Terrace for your dining needs (and the outdoor seating is the best!)",

I found it kind of odd that the server even shared her frustration about how loud it was inside while seating us outdoors.   We Ordered: Monkey Bread $6 (DELISH nice gooey & sweet) Fruit Plate $8 (Satisfying portion size of seasonal fruit) Egg White Omelette $10   **Shrimp & Grits $15 I appreciate the chefs creativity with the panko grit balls however they were terrible and left a gritty residue in my mouth. I found it odd the shrimps weren't sauteed either. The shrimp cocktail on top of salad was not satisfying and I'm pretty disappointed by this dish.  Bottle of Aqua Panna  **(1) Cup of Coffee the Sugar never made it to the table!   We requested Cholula hot sauce to spruce up the shrimp & grits and the server showed up with Tabasco at the end of the meal. DEFINITELY A SERVICE FAILURE.   I was completely okay with paid parking until walking back to my vehicle from a dissatisfying lunch.  Not likely to return although the Calamari looks epic from the shared YELP photos.",

My wife also loves mimosas. I chose this place because it had a decent priced (possibly cheapest price) bottomless mimosa in town. We were told about the container yard by one of our lyft drivers and it was happen stance that the place we wanted to go to was in the container yard.  I am so very glad we chose to eat at this place. The food is excellent and the mimosas were priced right. My wife decided to drink her moneys worth of mimosas which meant 5. To get the bottomless mimosas you have to order you own meal. She ordered the short rib hash and I got the monkey bread. Oh man both were delicious, but that monkey bread was one of the best things i ate on the entire trip!! I dont plan on going to Vegas again soon, but I would definitely consider coming back for this place alone!! Worth the trip and the container yard as a whole was really cool, plus a visit to old town Vegas is always fun!!",

I've only tried the latter, but I was very pleased :)  Situated in the corner of Container Park, overlooking the main stage area, the Perch is aptly named. The interior decor is bright and charming, and in the morning/daytime it takes advantage of the ample ambient light streaming in through the big windows. Location wise, it's fantastic. It feels secluded, and it definitely doesn't feel like Vegas. The mornings are nice and quiet in this area.  I tried the cornflake French toast, and it was absolutely delectable. French toast is my 2nd favorite food, so I've had it a bunch of times in a large number of places, and this was definitely one of the best. Be sure to check in and take advantage of your free pour!  I'd be curious to come back at night and see what it's like for dinner. Last but not least, the waitstaff was courteous and kind.",

We were told to seat anywhere, she brought us waters without prompting and swiftly answered any questions we had about the menu. I got the steak frites which is pictured, the sauce was amazing and the meat was so tender. My girlfriend got what may be the best veggie burger in the world. The bottomless mimosas were just an added bonus. The service was equally amazing as the food. Should you find yourself in container park, do yourself a favor and come here! You will not regret it.",

    "text": "After cooking so many meals at home lately my partner and I decided to grab a nice dinner out. We forgot to make reservations, so many places were full on a Saturday so we decided to check container park and see how that was.  I've been to the perch before but my partner hadn't so we decided to go for it. Host stand is tricky to find. I noticed many guests have that problem. Maybe a sign saying wait here at the top of the stairs so people will feel acknowledged. We waited a couple of minutes while a gentleman with glasses bussed a table for us so we didn't have to wait longer so I appreciated that.  After we sat down I checked in on yelp and got a free glass of wine and my partner got a sampling of an amazing beer he loved. Our server Alexis was a peach. She was so sweet and took great care of us.  We started with the Arugula flat bread with prosciutto. I'm not one for arugula because I find it too bitter but thisssssssss was amazing. From the sauce to the meat, so delicious. The appetizer almost out did the entree.  I decided to try the seafood pasta special. It was spaghetti pasta with marinara sauce and salmon, calamari and shrimp. I told Alexis I was allergic to tomatoes and wanted the dish so she made a great recommendation, get the Sriracha cream sauce instead. Man am I glad she told me to do that. My partner loved it so much I could tell he wanted my dish.   I'm from Boston so seafood for me is always iffy out here mainly because I'm seafood spoiled. The shrimp in the dish was NOT good. Very chewy and didn't appreciate the taste. Other than that it was the only negative to the night.   Eating out on the perch was great we had great views, service, vegas weather and live music. What else could you ask for? Would I come back? Oh yes!! Thank you Alexis and the perch staff.",

We decided on it and were ready to order when the waiter tells us they are all out of entrees and we have to order 2 appetizers each for the mimosas.  By this point I think to myself. Do I really wanna eat 2 appetizers that means between my friend and I we would have to order 4 appetizers.  They told us to return at 4pm and they could probably make an entree for us.  We decided to leave and not come back.  Since we had already payed parking we ended up walking container park for a while and went to a bar next door.",

A special event earlier in the day prevented them from offering their brunch menu, we arrived at approx 11:30 AM..  The server was kind and courteous but was more preoccupied with a meeting with her boss as opposed to tending to her table. Could've spent our hard earned $38 at plenty of other places.   Food was ok, temp of steak was a little under medium but was edible. Fries w/steak had no salt. Egg white omelete was also not seasoned nor were we offered salt & pepper..",

This is an excellent place for dinner, lunch, brunch, or just late night drinks. The Container Park is a great place to chill out for all ages. The Perch has incredible food, friendly staff and excellent bartenders.   Our server was super nice and very attentive. The gentleman who manages The Perch greeted us outside as we sat in the sun waiting for the place to open. 100% hands on to ensure we were happy.   We sat outside, enjoyed the great weather and relaxed on the couch. I had bottomless Bloody Mary's, which are the best in town. I'm a Bloody Mary snob and I've tried them all over the world. The Perch is #1 hands down.   I ordered the monkey bread to start which was outstanding. Even my super picky wife enjoyed it. For the main course I ordered the Brioche French toast. Amazing. The bread had a crispness to it like it was coated in corn flakes. The bananas were warm and perfectly cooked. The toast was decadent, with plenty of caramel sauce. I ordered bacon to balance the sweetness, and honestly it should be included with the meal to balance it out. Bacon was super crisp.   I'm so excited about this place and so invested in their success that I've told every friend and coworker about it. In the middle of brunch my wife turned to me and said, this is our place now. We'll be back.",

The bartender and our server were very quick at refilling for us.. bottomless indeed! The Perch Burger was okay.. flavor was good, very simple, juicy patty, but could have used a fried egg in it.

It's located in a cool spot at Container Park that matches the overall atmosphere of the area.  SERVICE: Awesome staff! Everyone was welcoming and friendly. We didn't have a reservation and came in during a busy time.. the manager tried really hard to get us in as quickly as possible. Awesome!

You can tell the chef and the kitchen staff are meticulous and particular about the taste and presentation -- neither disappointing. I went with the grilled salmon that came with brussels sprouts and asparagus, topped with a homemade avocado mousse. The kitchen even asked how I'd like my salmon cooked! Truly appreciate that.

We grabbed a table and another server running over and seemed very flustered. We didn't have any menus and she immediately started asking us about drinks. We were still settling into our seats so we both just said waters to start. She's like okay so nothing else? I then asked for a menu. Then the first server who greeted us came out with table settings and one glass of water... For two people?  We ordered a bunch of stuff to share and had to repeat several times what we wanted bc the server didn't seem to be familiar with the menu.   Then a manager came over and asked if we had a reservation, and yes I had made a reservation on opentable.  I got a Moscow mule and it wasn't every good... I ordered a glass of wine instead . Then the food came. Crab cakes were great.  Everything else needed a tweak. We got the carpaccio which was drenched in truffle oil. There was no balance of flavors. It was awful. And it came with a \"potato puree\" which we didn't understand. But either way it sucked, it needed butter.  We got the \"Salmon Tiradito, Spicy Cucumber & Mango Salsa\" which looked amazing according to these pictures on yelp... Well yeah not so much. It looked like a bright and colorful dish, but it was missing something. We took the cilantro lime sauce from the crab cakes and added it to the dish very lightly, and it made such a difference.   We also ordered the \"Mozzarella & Heirloom Tomatoes Red Onion, Micro Basil\". The first bite was great but that's about it. I really like red onions when they are balanced. There were so many red onions, that it was all I could taste. It was not pleasant.   And we pretty much a quarter to half the dishes before they started to take stuff \"out of our way.\" I let the server know no was still working on the salmon. We ask for the check. I still have a glass of wine and salmon I'm eating when the server comes back with our bill, as I reach to my purse she puts my small plate on to the salmon dish...WTF?! And takes it away. I was so irritated. Then I'm finishing my wine, and the server decides to take our ice teas and water away.... Are you serious?  We are still sitting there, the place is not busy.... And I'm clearly drinking my wine.   And never at any point were we offered dessert. Since we didn't each much here we ended up at Pinche Tacos, which was good.   Honestly it was horrible. I would never go back and I would not recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "Downtown Terrace deserves all 5 of my stars. Found this place on Instagram prior to visiting Las Vegas and read the reviews here on Yelp to confirm the deliciousness and that's exactly what it was. Came with a group of 8 people on a Friday afternoon for brunch. I had never been this far down on Freemont, so from the bus stop it was a few blocks down, but not far enough to complain. It was nice to see things down this direction. When we got to the restaurant there was no outside seating, which would have been nice because it was a beautiful day, but they sat us right away inside. One person ordered the bacon flight, which we passed around for everyone to taste. One had some sort of horseradish/mustard sauce on it and I was a little concerned, and it ended up being my favorite of the trio. I ordered the short rib hash for my meal and it was more than enough food. The only improvement I would have added would have been a little heat. They did provide hot sauces, but I'm not a fan of Tabasco or Cholula...but this is merely a complaint. Everything was great. Oh and let's not forget the bottomless mimosas, bellinis, or bloody marys for only $15! I would definitely return if I was in town. Worth the trip!",

I don't always rely on these reviews regarding food because everyone's pallet is different and there's always that one person who has to find something wrong -_- ALSO THERE WAS A PARTY OF 8-10 PEOPLE THAT WERE REALLY LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS THAT WERE ASKED TO LEAVE BECAUSE THEY WERE SOOOOO LOUD WHICH PRETTY MUCH RUINED OTHER CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCE AND  EVERYONE COMPLAINED BECAUSE OF THEM. -_- despite THOSE people the review must go on :-)  After being to pretty much every brunch in Vegas now my wife and I will start writing reviews. The food is fresh and freakin delicious. Bottomless mimosas for $15? Perfect and it lasts until 3pm. Service is important to us so the hostess as well as our server were so cool! The ambiance is super dope. although we would love to eat outside, the heat would burn every hair on our heads off but I'm sure in the fall or spring this place would be great for an outdoor brunch!   Meals:   Breakfast sandwich with chorizo is FIRE (Fire=really good) Steak and egg tacos bomb (bomb=good but not FIRE) Breakfast sandwich with bacon is FIRE (see definition above)   Hostess - Tyler....great guy from Youngstown Ohio Server/bartender- Josh....great guy and he was our camera man! (He knows the angle matters)",

Couldn't miss the Truffle Shuffle of Goonies, come on that's classic.  Onto the food...who am I kidding. I drank a bunch of Moscow Mules that were fantastic with impressively fresh mint. I twisted my friends arms to drink them with me. Then we split up some gorgeous tomatoes and mozzarella and a wonderful tuna tostada that was brilliantly highlighted with a spicy mayo of sorts to keep my tuna from sliding away.  Perch takes al fresco dining to another level. At night dining comfortably with friends among a relaxed atmosphere such as Perch is refreshing.",

    "text": "I came here tonight and I was pretty disappointed with the food and service.  I saw 4 stars on Yelp for this joint and was looking forward to a great meal, but unfortunately Perch did not deliver.  I came here with some friends and both of my friends had steak with salad and steak with fries. I had the poached egg bib salad with chicken.   I told the waitress to take off 2 things from the salad and I knew very well that there was no mention of any onions on the menu.  Well to my surprise when I got my salad there where onions on it. Unfortunately I can not eat onions, because I am allergic.  This ordeal would have been avoided if the menus were up to date.   In a nutshell I asked the waitress if she could have the salad remade and she did, but having to wait an additional 15-20 minutes to get my food was not fun.  In all honesty it would have been great if at least half of my salad would have been taken off my bill.   This was a pretty obvious slip up for a place that supposedly offers 4 star food and service.   And another bad move on behalf of the staff is when I asked about the Riesling I was told that it was sweet when it was actually dry. In all honesty how can you not know your wines?  This was not what I expected from Perch and at this point if I come back it'll be a while.  There are a few important details that Perch has to work on before I could truly consider them a True 4 star joint.  For now based on the slow service, inaccuracy of their menu and high priced mediocre food I give them 2 stars.",

We were happy that they accommodated us with an 8-month old. The staff was so cute with him! My Manhattan was delicious and comparable to the Whiskey bar we had just come from!  The food was great! I had the Perch Burger with a fried green tomato! The slightly sweet tomato went great with the meal. I won't forget the fries and yummy aioli that came with it. My friend tried the beef carpaccio which was different... rare meat with mashed potatoes. It was pleasing and well paired with the cheese, but I am not sure if we would get it again. We also tried the chimichurri sandwich, which borrowed the tangy flavor of its name-sake. We loved the bold flavors!  Everyone here was so nice and accommodating. The food was wonderful! I will be back! (in Terminator voice...)",

In their 'FILLERS' section is a dish called \"Seafood Pasta: Penrod Tomato Sauce.\" No further description. I ordered it as takeout.  I assumed it would be like the picture. No. It was shrimp and various pieces of calamari sitting on top of mushy penne pasta that fell apart when I stabbed it with my fork. It was sitting in a pool of watered down tomato sauce that actually made the seafood taste fishy. Those of you that have eaten good shrimp and calamari know it has that fresh clean taste... this was gross. The entire thing tasted and smelled like salty, somewhat tomato-ish, fish. Like a bad fish stew. I couldn't finish it... and the portion was tiny. I couldn't believe I spent $15 on it.  HUGE disappointment, don't ever get that Seafood Pasta.",

We had the salmon taratlis (sp?), the Bianca flat bread, and I cannot recall the salad name, and the mozzarella tomato app. Favorite was def the flatbread and the mozzarella. Both had impeccable flavor. My boyfriend did comment that the mozzarella was some of the freshest/best he has ever had.(he is a full blooded Italian from Port Chester NY)  Drinks were okay and I felt Iike they were smaller we had a Moscow mule and Royal Fir. But other then that it was great! Thank you Kirby for such great service! We will def be back",

    "text": "For some unknown reason, my boyfriend and I decided to brave the heat and take a stroll downtown on a Wednesday afternoon - which I do not recommend, by the way. I could feel my shoes melting on the pavement... Anyway, we're locals with one mutual day off, so we do what we can to make the most of it, living downtown and such. Yadda yadda yadda. Many people have talked about the Perch so we strategized our route to where we could pop in & cool off before checking out the shops in Container Park.  Upon arrival, we were the only patrons in the restaurant. After being seated and served ice water immediately, we were given a moment to chill out and browse the menu. I was a little disappointed with the options. For some reason, I was expecting there to be a bit more variety. Honestly, the brunch menu was a lot more appealing - but it's only available on Saturday & Sunday mornings. Booooo...  I ended up ordering the fried chicken sandwich and the boy got Thai chili chicken tenders with fries. Both were very tasty! You could taste just about every ingredient in the sandwich, which was great. I was nervous because, in my opinion, fried chicken tends to take over & dominate the flavor in other dishes I've had - this was not the case for the Perch. Well done! However, one weird critique I have is with the size of the plate that the sandwich was served on... The sandwich is fairly large and with it being served atop a heap of fries, I had a hard time not making a mess because the plate was so small. Other than that, the Perch gets an A in the food/flavor aspect.  NOTE: This place does not serve Ranch, only chipotle buttermilk dressing. Had to knock off a star for that one, because boy, those chicken tenders & fries would've been out of this world with some plain ol' Ranch to dip 'em in...",

I usually like to try bruschetta anywhere we go and they offer it, but unfortunately 9/10 times it is very disappointing, not this one. This way of making and seasoning the tomatoes was the BEST I have ever tried. And once again, the best places so far have not been food chains and maybe that's the secret. I'm so concentrated in giving my opinion on he bruschetta because it truly was the best I've ever had. The other food was just as great. Deliciousness all around. We dined outside on the terrace and it was awesome. It was a bit chilly but thankfully they thought of everything and they had heaters outside so the temperature was nice. The waitress was nice and the guy that checked up on us was ok, his attitude was a bit on the \"I don't care if you're here\" feel but overall I would recommend this eatery 100%. Really the guy is the only reason I'm giving the place 4 stars. The food is what really matters and it was exquisite!!!",

We ordered steak and egg tacos and shared the French Toast with bananad, as recommended by the CHEF MARLON. The food was delicious and the reggae playing in the background was perfect..exactly what I was looking for. Our bartender STEFAN made me the best Damm jalapeno Margarita I ever had!! Nailed it!! Had a quick to it with the right amount of tequila!! I love it when they make us feel at home.",

Sat and watched multiple servers walk past us for a few minutes- no greeting what so ever. I had my heart set on ordering a salad on the lunch menu I had seen only to find out that they are only serving their brunch menu. Limited to say the least. Egg white skillet only offered 2 choices and of course the protein options were extra. Spent $15 on egg whites. No toast, No potatoes. Hubby ordered the Perch burger which pretty much came with 10 french fries. We both left hungry. To top it off we waited 30 minutes. $45 check came for some egg whites a burger and a bloody mary. Not worth it.  In summary, over priced, slow service and tiny portions.",

You must must must order the short rib hash with demi glace.  It was so good all I did was sit at the table, eat and nod my head the entire time.  My daughter ordered the breakfast tacos and the meat was perfect.  A great sweet addition?  The monkey bread.    Had to try a belini too.   YUM.    Trust me...you need to go here.

The entire place is lovely. So making a reservation, we expected to not have issues with service. The place was maybe 25% full, most of it us! Some of our orders ended up taking forever and a couple of us got theirs after some already ate and one order was never placed so she sat there almost 2 hours waiting for nothing.  We had to ask for refills and for our drinks and then they didn't split out our checks (after they asked us if we wanted it split.) We were annoyed and even though all of us loved the food, we said we weren't coming back due to the poor service.  (We chose this place because we were meeting up for BikeFest which was happening that weekend, so it was not a place we would have normally went to and our first visit.) The manager came to apologize a few times, tried to work out the missed food dish and apologized. All I could say was I was very disappointed especially since we made sure to make a reservation so they would be ready.  The manager ended up comping our entire table!! We never expected that kind of reaction for poor service and were shocked. This says alot about a company!! We were very impressed with everything, especially the manager's sincerity. Poor service can be fixed with training, but a place with this kind of integrity and responsiveness is refreshing! Great food, fabulous location, beautiful and chill vibe. Loved the place!!!!

I ordered their $20 Egg Salad with steak and ask for it to go. My destination was right in the park so this wasn't due to travel time but when I opened up my salad, I was extremely disappointed. The bread crostini were so hard I couldn't even eat them, literally could not even bite into it. The poached egg was still half raw and yolkless, couldn't eat it that either. The steak was really rare and looked like it had been squeezed together. The salad itself was seriously maybe 6 bites worth that included some bacon pieces, possibly less than 2oz of steak. This was not a refined $20 salad I was expecting, it was a $4 dollar salad at best. I will not be trying there food again because the lack of passion for the food clearly shows. Restaurants should be proud of the food they are putting out, even if it is to go.",
