    "text": "Great food, great serving staff. That's all I can say as far as what was good. We had a group of 10 waiting to get a table after being told 15 minute wait. They told us 20 minutes later it would be another 30 minutes because they were backed up even though they were seating smaller 3-5 group tables ahead of us. We even offered to split our group up to two tables to get seated sooner and were told that they can't do that. It took over an hour to get seated. When we did I counted 10 open tables and booths, two of which could've seated our entire group. We were the last group in there and when we were done we were the only ones in the restaurant. They could've done a better job getting us seated sooner and when I mentioned this politely to the manager and how long we waited and how frustrating it was, he said he would let them know and appreciated the feedback. I did not ask for any discount. The proper thing to have done would have been to apologize and over at least something. But nothing was offered and it felt like he was just placating me and not taking my feedback seriously. We won't be back- certainly not as a group. They lost business due to simple lack of organization and courtesy.",

    "text": "My wife and I had a couple of hours to burn before our movie so we decided to hit this place up because the food looked good and it was close by. We went to a couple of other places first but the lines were too long so we chose Hash House. When we pulled up the parking lot was mostly empty. Hmm? Anyways, we went inside and were seated right away. Our waitress took our order and brought our drinks quickly. We ordered the Sage Chicken with Eggs and the CrabCake Bennies. The food looked amazing on the other tables so our expectations were high. Our food arrived fairly quick and we dug in. The food portions are insane, I would suggest sharing a plate and maybe get a side. The lowdown on the food: the chicken was perfectly fried and placed over a huge helping of mashed potatoes. The chicken was crispy and moist. The potatoes were perfect! It came with a syrup reduction, on point! The wife's CrabCakes were tasty. They were also huge and covered with a spicy Benedict sauce. They were served over delicious biscuits. The food was worth the money, and you won't be leaving hungry. But that's about it. The service was lame. We had to wait for everything once we got our food. We needed more drinks, which didn't come until we were ready to leave. There were tables that hadn't been bused since we walked in. Our waitress appeared to have been also working the bar area and was occupied with people there. The other half of the restaurant was empty except for the manager sitting at a table working on staff schedules. The hallway to the restrooms also is conveniently used as a storage area (Not amused....) Overall, the food was good but the service was lacking, therefore leaving a negative experience. Service is just as important as the food...  Saturday, 2pm",

When we found out a location in Henderson was opening we were stoked.   The truth of the matter is that management in this location is non-existent. From 20 minute waits for drink refills or the check, to under seasoned, smaller than Hash House portions, service is sub par for any restaurant, let alone one in Vegas.   My poor experiences in this location are making me contemplate whether I even want to bother going to the original location.",

I had to ask twice for  the water.  We ordered our food and my dish arrived and my wife's food  arrived 13 minutes later, with no apology.  I order the chorizo and jalapeno hash with an extra egg, cooked over easy.  They were cooked over hard.  You would think a place that specializes in breakfast items would know how to cook over easy eggs!  The hash was not very good, just marginal at best.  It seems as if there no leadership at this restaurant.  Eight months from now look for this place to become a PT's Pub or a Dotty's.  This Hash House a GoGo sucks!",

Then there was the time I put in a to go order to pick up myself and one of the bartenders informed me that if its been over an hour, they throw out your food and then have to remake it when you get there because the cold stuff sat out too long. Don't they have refridgerators that keep that cold stuff until its time for pick up. BTW they quoted me it would be ready in 15-20 min and I got there right at the 50 min mark for pick up, not over an hour.",

Their food is also top-notch, and although not super cheap, it's definitely worth it and splitting a meal is always an option. My personal favorite dishes are the Bacon, Avocado, Onion, and Swiss Egg Scramble (the biscuit is so big and fluffy) and the Kokomo Meatloaf Sandwich (bursting with amazing flavor). Dishes I've tried that were not my favorite were their Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles (surprisingly, because it is normally one of my faves at other places - it just had a weird taste) and Andy's Sage Fried Chicken (I wasn't a fan of the spicy sauce that's all over it, although I know others who love it). Definitely recommend this place!",

Next time I will have to just remember to ask for no rosemary on the plate. The huge honey biscuits with butter and fresh strawberry jam was the bomb. I could of just had that and been satisfied.

    "text": "This is my first visit to the Henderson location of this popular \"Brand\" restaurant. We were surprised to find it fairly easy to get seated at 630 on a Saturday night. But I soon learned why.   After a brief two minute wait at the hostess station while she figured out which empty booth to put us in, we were seated in the bar area without being asked if we had a preference.   After a few more minutes our server Jes???  arrived to take our drink order. She was quick to deliver our ice teas and then we did not see her for twelve minutes while we had questions about the menu. I finally asked a buser and he cleared up the fact that they dont have a real dinner menu or even real appetizers.   I should have done my homework.   When our server arrived to take our order I had a question about an appetizer. She answered, I ordered and we also placed our entree orders at the same time since we had been there so long.  A runner brought our appetizer,  the pork tenderloin with bbq creme sauce out in a metal basket with sweet potato fries. Too bad we didn't have plates. Then once we received plates to eat our appetizer in less than five minutes we had our entrees. First the runner brought my husband's chicken pot pie then a few minutes later my kokomo sandwich which is a meatloaf with cheese sandwich.   The food overall is under seasoned. Most of their entrees are served with rosemary sprigs as decorations but some salt would be better if used.   Neither of us had managed to get even half way through our entree when our server walked over and committed what was the final sin to us both.   She brought us the bill. She didn't ask if we wanted dessert, which they do have on the menu and which we had planned to order. At that point I through my hands up, leaned back and we both tossed our napkins on the table. Our server did assure us when she brought our bill that we didn't have to rush ,that there was no hurry but in my world when you get a bill the restaurant is pushing you out the door.   Its the ultimate in restaurant rudeness.   To top it off, she noticed us leaning back while she was behind the bar and called out asking if we wanted to go containers. A good server would have realized that there was no way we had finished eating and maybe we were just a bit upset. My face might have told her I was not happy.  Then a runner comes around to show us desserts. TOO LATE ...I am already paying for my half eaten dinner and appetizer.  I did tip the server. 10 %. Then I  wrote a very brief note about why she only received 5.00.   I didn't judge her for the not great food. But bad service is the servers fault and it can't be blamed on being busy. They weren't.  The manager was there. He stopped by our table and asked how things were. How do you tell the poor man that it will be the last time we  come in because the server doesn't know the basics.",

This skillet had it all. Here's the ingredients right off the menu: Crispy potatoes, garlic chicken sausage, roasted red & yellow peppers, fresh asparagus, and goat cheese all topped with two eggs and served with a fresh buttermilk bisquit.  There was a fresh fruit garnish too. The array of flavors really stimulated my taste buds and it was hard to push it away when I was full. The Hash House has a lot to offer on their menu, a well stocked bar and well placed televisions with sports broadcasts.  I'll definitely return",

    "text": "This place is a great four star breakfast place, and a three star lunch place.  If you wanna have an awesome breakfast, please go here for sure!  1. Breakfast  a. The Wait - If you come on Saturday or Sunday, be prepared to wait up to one hour starting after 8:00 am. This place is packed.  b. The Sun - If it is the weekend and in our summer or when warm, this restaurant faces the morning sun so be sure to grab a space to wait inside.  Little kids and older folks may not be comfortable.....  c.  The Food - Amazing. On various visits now, my wife keeps ordering the Sundied Tomato, Goat Cheese, Smoked Chicken Scramble. I have had the Mushroom,  Artichoke, tomato and spinach Hash House that was mixed up with a bunch of goodness and that was amazing too. Kids have had various meals here from Flapjacks, Skillets and all have thoroughly enjoyed it.  d.  The Food II - The key to this food is good ole farm fresh food. Proteins, Eggs, Meats, Veggies. Flapjacks and all designed to give you energy that last an entire day.  The presentation and service is also fantastic.  e.  The four star is due to fact that the breakfast food is great yet the service and waiting time suffer due to being so busy.  Service and waiting time strongly influence a meal...  2. Lunch a. The wait - After about 1:00 am, the wait is much better. We came in at 3:00 pm and it was perfect on a Saturday. Not sure why they stuck us behind a pillar by ourselves, which was hidden from a good service view, however, there was no wait.  b.  The food - The wife ordered the griddled Meatloaf with eggs and mashed potatoes.  This is a huge and amazing dish that she could not finish. I had a taste and the eggs are decent, the meatloaf a bit stiff / hard , not bad but not melt in your mouth. Potatoes are very good. And the biscuit was nothing to die for at all.  I was going light as I was going to have dinner. I ordered the Warm Spinach with no cheese and vinaigrette on side. I think that the waiter should have mentioned that this salad in this set up is bagged spinach, 6 cherry tomatoes and about a tablespoon of diced onion with about 2 tablespoon of bacon bits.  This was something both uninspiring and also unappetizing. The waiter should know their food and help because this was absolute nothingness of a food order.  My son had the Roasted Pork Tenderloin Hash house and well, he did not eat all of it. By the way, the biscuits they serve look like they would be awesome with some butter and jam.  Where are those at?  c. Perhaps - Maybe it was the time of day, maybe it was an ending shift. but the food was not great at this time, the waiter was nice yet non-existent, and the price was not really worth it.  I will be back for breakfast, and perhaps give them a chance for lunch again. Yet, I am not excited about the lunch and perhaps will order something decadent on their list as they may be better at that!  No flavorful healthy choices here that I found.",

The only down size is that the portions are monstrous! It definitely tests you self control!",

When the eggs come back from the kitchen and then they are burnt, they are getting sent back. Whitney, don't just flip the eggs over and say \"okay....how do these look?\" They are still burnt! Do your job correctly and you will get better monetary tips than tips from yelp.",

Everything else was barely warm. Not one to complain, we ate our meal, tipped the server 20% and walked out. Service was good, wasn't the servers fault the kitchen/management are ok with serving below average breakfast. But for $50 for two people, it is a joke that they prep everything hours in advance. I get it, it's Father's Day, you want ticket times to be quick. But at least make sure your food comes out hot and fresh. This place is a joke and I will not be coming back. IHOP is even better than you guys",

    "text": "My review is only based on the service of our waitress, kris. She was the worst waitress I can honestly say I have ever had in my life.   My boyfriend and I regularly eat at hash house. We were excited to find there was one closer to our house. So typically we HAD to go.   Walking in they quoted us 30 minutes which is fine, they even sat us in about 10 minutes, even better!!! When we got to our table, I believe it was the manager and she took our drink orders right away and everything was great. Then comes kris. We had our friend with us so she was still browsing the menu. She made her feel rushed to make her decision. Then I proceeded to order what I've ordered every single time I've ever been to hash house, andys sage fried chicken Benedict. Delicious! Usually. I don't like scrambled eggs something about the texture, but whatever. I always get them over-easy no problem. Kris told me I wasn't able too because it would ruin the quality of the dish... When I told her I didn't like my eggs scrambled she then offered to put them on the side and I was totally fine with that. When the food was brought out, it was made with scrambled. When I reminded her I should have had over-easy on the side she began to argue with me saying that I never told her that. She then told me it would be a few minutes and the manager was fixing it. When my food was brought I had my eggs on the side but the original plate was still made with scrambled, so I picked it off not trying to be difficult. Maybe 5 minutes after I started eating she came over asking if we needed to-go boxes... \"I don't know yet, we're still eating?\" She then brought the check.   Every time she refilled my boyfriends soda she must have spilled it or something because his cup was so sticky he didn't even want to touch it.   I'm a strong believer in tipping and excellent service deserves a hefty tip. We tipped her $1.69 just to even out our check. I didn't even agree with that.   I hope this review is read and kris works on her customer service, I've worked in customer service a very long time. And two of the top rules is never tell the customer they're wrong and especially don't argue.   I don't know if we'll ever go back.",

Our waitress asked if I wanted to get a combo, and I declined. It was the right choice because the pancake was bigger than my face. My husband and I split it and we still have some leftover.  I ordered the Snickers pancake, which was absolutely delicious. I also ordered a hot chocolate, which was good but a little awkward to drink on account of the chocolate syrup drizzled everywhere.

    "text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: I won't be going back.  Tractors, tractors, tractors, everywhere. OK, I get it, the farm-to-table concept. Enough, already. Enough!  My first visit to HHGG was WAY-back-in-the-day of its first Vegas locations' soft-opening, West Sahara, at the invitation of an acquaintance of part-owner Jim Nyberg (whom introduced himself while we were there).   The roof was leaking over our table (hey, it WAS a soft-opening, forgiven), but the portions were huge, so I left impressed.   I don't remember being run over by any tractors.  Fast forward almost a dozen years, my next visit, this evening.   The A/C was broken. I get that, things happen. So, going-in, I wrote off off the 7pm empty parking lot to that situation, rather than as a referendum on the venue itself. (The parking lot is a rule I generally use as a deciding factor going-in, but I was curious where HHGG is today).   On the other hand, the A/C is impacting revenue, so someone should be paying the premium needed to get the HVAC guy on-site after-hours. I caught a break, my booth at the far back had a portable fan running right next to it.  The special was a ten-buck chicken fried steak, veggie, mashed potatoes, biscuit. I fronted it with a $4 side salad.   The side salad was a shocker. The bowl was the size of a 4\"x6\" index card with sides only about 3/4\" of an inch high. Yeah, that china was certainly chosen to make small look full. I just knocked back a tasty side salad (for the same price) at Village Pub the other day that clocked in at about three times the volume. And by that I mean the normal volume for a side salad.   Penny-pinching on Iceberg lettuce and Roma tomatoes -and get this - ONE cruton. A big one, but one just the same. And it was as tough & chewy as a kitchen sink sponge. Come on management, what is this place facing bankruptcy or something?  The CFS plate was huge, part of the central concept/draw of this chain. The CFS itself was a much-larger-than-average portion, but the presentation is designed to make things look even bigger, as it was draped over a huge pile of potatoes. My guess is that there is about a pound-and-a-half of food on this large oval plate.  Unfortunately, the CFS was a not-so-fun cut/quality of meat, and it clearly had to be heavily tenderized to qualify for serving. The potatoes: just potatoes with some garlic and cheese thrown in to give them some flavor. Overall, pretty bland. But a-whole-lotta bland.  The biscuit represented more cheap carbs contributing to the plate's weigh-in. Over 2 inches tall. Chewy-tasty enough, when drizzled with some butter. Jam would have been nice, I shoulda asked.  The veggie was four -- count 'em four - little string beans, or maybe they were asparagus. They were so puny & shriveled up I wasn't exactly sure. I wolfed 'em, of course, and I still don't remember any actual flavor telling me which they actually were.  After tea & tip, I was in for a twenty. For the \"special.\" That being mostly a massive plate of bland mashed potatoes.  Bottom line: Really big, really filling, but not all that scrumptious. Maybe this is why the parking lot is light, after all.  Maybe this approach is your cup-of-tea, or a lot of folks' cup-of-tea. But it doesn't work for me. If I want to top-off-the-tank with low-octane-fuel, I can just hit the low-end casino buffets for seven smackers at lunchtime.   And there I can fill a whole plate with salad.",

    "text": "We've been here a couple of times before our visit today and have had some good service - nothing to write home about, but reasonably good service and good food that the husband loves.   I decided to bring him here for Father's Day brunch since he loves their country fare. Boy, what a day to bring him on a special day ...   Service: We had a reservation so were sat fairly quickly. However, we never had a server come to the table to get us drinks. It was 115 out today and we were hankering for water! So I had to ask someone bussing tables to see who was handling our area. Then, three people came to get our drink order out of confusion. We finally got in our water order, but juice was brought instead of mimosas we'd ordered since there were \"too many cooks in the kitchen.\" Three times someone else came with food not meant for our table. We put in an order for my mom and myself to share the chicken and waffles and no share plate was brought. So, we asked the person who brought our food for one and he never came back. Again, I had to get up and ask the bartender to help with our drink order and for another plate (not his job.)   Food: here is where we had no issues. We enjoyed our food we ordered. The portions were huge and there was plenty to share. Luckily hubby loved his chicken pot pie and had plenty to spare.  Environment: it was a nice casual day full of dads enjoying their special day on Father's Day. Many servers told them happy Father's Day ... but my husband was not one of them. It was obvious too since our daughter was between us in a high chair and he was taking time with her throughout.  I'm not sure we will be back. Of all days, this is a day we should see great service to someone like my husband celebrating Father's Day and it seemed like the restaurant was overflowing with people and mega busy when indeed it wasn't. The food is good, but I would rather wait longer at a smaller restaurant who takes more time to care about their customers.",

    "text": "First time at this restaurant at the recommendation of 2 friends, on our way out of Vegas. Overall I'd recommend this place if you are a local and want great, creative cuisine food, but if you're passing through, I'm not sure I'd recommend it. I  likely will not return. I'll start with the positives, the place was clean and the atmosphere relaxed and fun. I LOVED that I was able to make a reservation for a Sunday morning, the prior day via an Open Table link on their website. There was clearly a wait when we arrived, but we were seated in accordance with our reservation nonetheless. Staff were all really friendly and seemed to enjoy their jobs. The food was AMAZING (I had the crab cake benedict and my sister ordered the chicken and waffles). Everything about the experience was amazing BUT their portions are INSANELY large. I get that it's part of their appeal and is probably great for locals who enjoy leftovers as much as I do. However, for folks who are passing through town to or from Vegas (we we visiting from Arizona), taking leftovers just isn't an option. When I asked whether they offered half plates, I was told they do not. I thought that unfortunate as I knew I'd not eat even half of the entree I paid $19 for, and would be wasting enough food to feed a small village in the end, which always breaks my heart a little. I really wish they would change that policy. I just found it wasteful and unfortunate. Unless they do, sadly, I won't return. Photo is of the benedict mentioned above. Beyond delicious.",

Not busy at all on a Sunday night! Once we gave our drink order we didn't see our waitress for a while. I had to start asking what everyone had ordered for drinks that was taking so long. I wish she had offered appetizers bc I really wanted to try the fried green tomatoes but by the time she came back with our drinks I forgot and everyone was ready to order. The food didn't take too long but long enough to know it was made to order. Those plates were beautiful presented. I don't think anyone's good stood out on the flavor scale except my nieces French fries. Those were spectacular ! Everything else tasted the same as if u made it at home... except bigger. The atmosphere was alright, I could've used some modern country music to liven it up and really bring that southern feel out.  The restroom was pretty clean and didn't smell. Waitress was polite and not overly checking on us but just enough. The plate prices averaged around $10- 20 for the most part. When u see the size of the plate you will see why! Also the best part.. they support the troops and give military discount if you bring your ID!",

    "text": "Great service. Food was above part. Very little wait time -- on a Saturday evening. Whatever the bad experiences that transpired in the past from previous Yelpers at this Hash House A Go Go I did not have them today. I usually go to their location at the M. The Henderson location is every bit as good as the M's and I think it's too bad that others have had bad experiences. I was treated well by everyone, the place was great and my food was very pleasing.  Accommodations included a hip regular eating section and a sports bar dining section. The sports bar dining section has full on bar with wide screens on the walls and behind the bar. Decor featured memorabilia citing accomplishments and famous guests. I've seen many places do this it speaks well of the joint to have entertained so many honorable guests.  I ordered the chicken pot pie that came a pie crust separated from the pie. The crust was the size of a small hat! Very tasty and savory, too much to finish at one sitting. The kiwi watermelon lemonade was a delight: Light, sweet but not too much, reminds me of spring. I also tasted my wife's meatloaf sandwich. It was big, meaty, reminded me of mom's best right out of the oven. All dishes were strongly represented.  What's my bottom line? I'm convinced that Hash House A Go Go is better as breakie/brunch place than a dinner place. While what I had was great, their breakfasts are killer! These are two of their featured dinner items and they did not disappoint. Tiny deductions only because much of what they did or tried has been done before but what they did was done very well. I'm going back again for more. My actual rating is a solid 4.5 stars...",

    "text": "If you think quaNTity is more important than quaLity, Hash House A Go Go is your type of restaurant. Yes the prices are rather high for your average breakfast chain restaurant, but the portions are huge (Stand outside the door and watch the customers walk out, you know the portions are big when you see 200+ lb customers carrying out to go bags).  The 2 things worth eating are the Andy's sage chicken and the brown sugar banana flapjacks. I've tried other things on their menu and they've all been disappointing (Chicken and waffles, the Hash). Andy's is a bunch of chicken, potatoes, egg, etc. etc. layered on top of each other with sauce dripping down. Its good- maybe share. The brown sugar banana flapjacks are sweet enough to not need maple syrup. YUM.  The restaurant has a bar with TV (happy hour!!!!) and tons of seating. Show up on a Sunday and the Manager will be there greeting and asking you how service was.",

    "text": "I would like to give it 4 stars based on the generous portions, but the service rubbed me the wrong way. We went on a Thursday night and were kind of surprised when we were told there would be a 10 minute wait. I guess it's still somewhat new, so people are eager to try it out.   I ordered an Italian soda and a minute later a different waitress stopped by and asked what flavor I wanted. I responded I didn't know they come in different flavors. She said, oh yes, there are 10 different flavors that are listed on the menu. I handed her the menu, and she flustered because well, the flavors aren't listed. She struggled to name three and I settle don butterscotch.  We ordered the chicken and waffles and chicken pot pie. The chicken and waffles was awesome, but I didn't dig the pot pie so much. I didn't like that the crust was separate from the filling, and it was made from dry tasting crackers instead of a buttery dough. If you're not a fan of leftovers, I recommend sharing an entree otherwise you're likely to end up with leftovers.   A few minutes after the entrees were delivered, the waitress brought us our check. What????? Even though she was all smiles and told us not to hurry, it still bothered me. Unsurprisingly, she never stopped by our table to check on us again until we were ready to pay.",

Hulls of lettuce and brown lettuce in the salad, fried chicken seemed like it was cooked earlier and thrown back in the fryer (I owned a restaurant, I know what it looks and tastes like). Now I'm at the location on Stephanie St in Henderson and here we go again. The coffee in the urn wasn't hot and they have two bartenders working (wait for it) the whole bar, service bar, take out, AND three tables in the bar area. Way too much. Poor, poor management. It's not even that busy and these poor girls are being run ragged. Stay tuned, my food just came.  Too salty, my god! Huge portions, though. Food was not that hot, either. I got the bacon, avocado, scrambler. It's 4 hours later and I haven't stop burping my meal (sorry, gross. I know). I just can't give this place another try. Won't be ever coming back.",

The server came over a few moments later, I  believe his name was Josh, he was nice,  nothing special. I had the Andy's sage fried chicken Benedict and he had the salmon Benedict. Both were good but again nothing special. The serving sizes were impressive. I took home half of my plate but he finished his. To spend $54 on breakfast I would have expected to be wowed but it was just a mediocre experience all around. I'd go back if someone else wanted to go there but probably not on my own free will.",

I skipped their Famous Bread Pudding as I have ordered it on other occasions and always found it to be about the worst I have ever had worldwide . Skip it !!  The waitress offered Chocolate cheese cake. Sorry again. It was a large slice of a non cheese cake mostly made up of chocolate chips. Just about stale . Should have returned it. Sorry I didn't.",

The sign outside says happy hour everyday 4-7 we get there at 6:45 and my brother and I decide we'll get a beer before dinner. Go to the bar table the male bartender (never got his name) tells us happy hour is 3-6 and walks away from us. I go outside and double check the sign thinking maybe I was mistaken because he went and asked another server to verify the happy hour time. I come back inside thinking they will honor their sign they tell me nope 3-6 only and he walks away again with complete disregard for us as customers.  We get seated and he is our server and he realizes we are part of the table of six and tries to be more kind. My wife tells the man he should apologize for disregarding my brother and I. He says \" I don't make the signs I don't have to apologize for anything and I'm not going to take your attitude\". We got up and left immediately. This is one of the only posts I've ever made like I said it was the male bartender working Friday night at 7 pm short hair and about 6 foot tall totally unprofessional I was with my parents, wife, grandmother, and brother not a rowdy crowd. I would like to add this was the first time I ever went here and was truly excited to try a new restaurant but sadly I will probably never go here again. Went next door to outback steakhouse and had wonderful service.",

Warning: the portions are very sizable.   I will definitely add this spot to one of my local favorites. The cost for 2 people and tip was very reasonable and the food, service and atmosphere were very satisfying.",

When we got there even though there was hardly anyone we did have to wait  more than usual to have our order taken. Once they did though the food came promptly. I had read from previous reviews that the portions were big, so I decided to just purchase one plate and share it with the hubby. I am glad we did because we both ate and had leftovers. We ordered the man vs food challenge which consisted of fried chicken, eggs, mashed potatoes and biscuits. The food was pretty good and we enjoyed it.   As far as the happy hour goes, I think they did have some pretty good drink specials. I ended up ordering a drink which I enjoyed. I don't recall the name though.   Even though this is not the best breakfast in town, the food was good enough that I would come back.",

The savior was the food was good (or we were just hungry) and the manager seemed to be on top of the issue. He apologized and helped the staff with getting our food. The waitress didn't seem to help the situation either. The impression is she didn't want to be there. In the 1.5 hour we were there, besides the basic communication, she only asked us once if everything was ok and no water refills.",

    "text": "We decided to eat lunch here because I had a yen for a burger and thought this might be good.  It wasn't.  It was one of - if not possibly the - worst I've ever had.  They have what they call \"stuffed\" burgers.  Dear Hash House:  A stuffed burger is a hamburger that is - guess what? Stuffed!  This was two pieces of meat smashed so flat beyond recognition that I'm surprised they didn't fall apart when they removed them from the grill.  Not a 'burger' by any stretch of the imagination.  Flat, tasteless pieces of meat.  Perhaps they should actually go places that serve hamburgers; you know, where you can actually taste flavor.  By the time they were done squashing the meat (there's no other way to say it) any semblance of flavor it might have had was gone...kaput.  I also thought I ordered the Swiss cheeseburger, but what might have been cheese at one point was cooked into the \"little holes\" that this thing that passed for burger had (because they, again, smashed it to smithereens).  There were probably three or four mini mushrooms (I think), and could not be considered anything close to what it is labeled.  Plus, the bun that they use is entirely too small - meat stuck out everywhere, making it impossible to pick up without getting greasy meat all over your hands.  Good thing they brought a knife, so I could at least cut this thing up.  I should have been suspicious when our server didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked (you know, rare, medium, etc.  Only fast food places never ask you because they cook them one way - badly).  Here's how you cook a hamburger:  You form the patty, put it on the grill, and turn it ONCE only, without smashing it like you're trying to kill all the flavor.  When it is finished (according to how someone wants it) you remove and place on a bun that fits.  You place the tomato, lettuce, onion and pickles on the side so the customer can stack them in the order they want, not throw them on the bun before you even place the meat on it.  Although this thing was billed as a \"stuffed\" burger, it was nothing more than two pieces of overcooked meat that they had somehow fitted a small piece of cheese and a few mushrooms between and called it stuffed.  It wasn't.  To make it worse, the server told us to order their \"fantastic\" fries - which were nothing more than store bought frozen (or tasted like it) seasoned fries.    Will I go back?  Probably not, since if they can't make a burger - which is pretty simple fare, then the rest of the food probably isn't that great.  Bigger isn't always better, and just because portions are big doesn't make it good; it just means you're paying more.  (Also, just wondering:  why was there a sprig of rosemary in the bun?  The burger nor the bun was flavored with it, so it seemed odd).",

The bartender was less that thrilled to be waiting on us, but I think that is her overall personality. The we ordered an appetizer, guacamole, salads and chips. The guacamole was very, very dark colored. Looked old and unappetizing. We mostly ate the chips and salsa. Then we ordered 2 entrees, which took a very long time to arrive. I was surprised too because it was 2 in the afternoon and only 1 other table and 1 guy at the bar. We ordered a burger and a hash. My hubby said his burger was not tasty at all and only ate half. The hash was good but the presentation didn't look appetizing. Keep in mind we have been car shopping and were starving, so we didn't have much a choice but to eat the food we ordered. To top it all off, we could here a meeting going. It was like every employee was airing their grievances which just made the whole lunch regrettable. I see other reviewers commenting on the service here and it seems to be a major problem for this location.",

I don't know how this city is on a Tuesday with their brunch but I'm from Florida and usually on a Tuesday it's not that busy. We didn't wait long for a seat. I tried out their kiwi watermelon lemonade, which was great! Initial taste was very tangy but after that I couldn't get enough of it. The watermelon that came with was sweet too. As for the food tho! When I go to a restaurant and I see that they serve crab cakes that is the first thing I get. I want to be able to try all crab cakes and compare it back home. This crab cake Benedict is by far one of my favorites (pretty much in my TOP 3) I'm usually someone who always have something to say about anything. The fact I have nothing to say about this dish says a lot. I just didn't know how to attack it, because the dish was huge! I usually don't eat asparagus but when I took a bite of that I couldn't get enough. The chili cream sauce that comes on the plate is GREAT. My friend ate it with her brown sugar banana flapjack and she says it gives it a sweet and salty taste to it that tastes amazing.   All in all most def would comeback to try out their crab cake sandwiches on saw on the menu.",

It was about 2:30 in the afternoon and pretty empty, which was awesome.  Seated right away.  Menu is extensive and takes awhile to look through!  Portion sizes are very large.  They match the price.  We loved their take on chicken and waffles.  The fried leeks on top added a great flavor element.  I wanted to try the Chicken pot pie but our server told us it wasn't good (lol).  I appreciate the honesty.  Pancakes are HUGE!  I think we found our go-to stop for when in Vegas with the kiddos!",

    "text": "We were looking for a breakfast spot and the menu looked interesting.  We split the corned beef hash - and we each had fresh orange juice. That was plenty!  I also had a coffee.  The hash was just OK. It was thin sliced corned beef cut into strips - not ground or diced meat. A bit odd and I did not appreciate the texture of the dish.  The potatoes were rather large chunks and although it had some swiss cheese in the dish - pretty nominal.  Not a bad meal, but not likely to return to this chain.  Maybe a better lunch spot - but given that it has \"hash\" in the name....",

It unreal, shock value especially for me since this was my first time at any Hash House A Go Go, and then once dig in realize getting food pretty good not just overkill on portion size. I ordered the one pound stuffed burger with hardwood smoked bacon, avocado, and cheddar. It comes with choice of sides I went with the mac and cheese. The burger both patties was cooked to my order medium, juicy, and add the filling brought the whole burger together. Talk about trying fit the whole burger in your mouth. Swear it workout all by itself. One of the best parts about it is so much going on juices and all expect hands get BIG time messy. I did. The mac and cheese. It was good. It was not heavy on the cheddar so the pasta dish not real thick thick little more on the creamy side. I liked it.   Our server was excellent. I came with triathlon family after our Silverman 70.3. So excess was great thing on this visit. He was great explaining things for first timer like me. He was on top all our drinks and checking up on us the whole time.   Not sure if come back to this location since it on the opposite side of town. I would definitely go to one of the other locations and check out more the  menu. Just make sure bring your appetite!!!!",

    "text": "Having been to the location in San Diego a few times, I knew what to expect and was not disappointed.  My partner and I arrived around 7:30pm on Wednesday evening and were immediately seated at a booth in the bar area. We perused the menu for quite a while and when the waitress arrived, we were prepared with both our food and drink orders.  I had the chicken and biscuits with vegetables and a cold brew coffee on draft.    Again, we sat for quite a while before our drinks were delivered. The cold brew was very good, a rich robust flavor expected from a properly steeped brew. The one minor caveat to their cold brew is the lack of regular sugar packets. Aside from the chemical sweeteners, they only offer the coarse natural sugar, which isn't a problem for hot coffee, but in the cold brew it does not melt and I ended up with a mouth full of sugar granules with every sip through the straw.  I finished the first glass prior to our food arriving and was not offered a refill until after we were already eating.  The chicken and biscuits is amazing and did not disappoint. Stacked high atop a bed of mashed potatoes and a huge biscuit was a perfectly grilled chicken breast covered with a vegetable puree topped with a fresh sprig of sage. On either side of the massive plate were perfectly cooked carrots and flash fried green beans, both with amazing flavor.  The puree, chicken, mash, and biscuits made for a different taste with every bite and each one better than the last. Needless to say, there was way too much food for a single sitting, maybe even for two sittings. But the leftovers were just as tasty!  My only reason for not giving 5 stars is the amount of time we sat waiting after we were seated.  Waiting to order, waiting for drinks, waiting for refills, and waiting for food. Because we were seated in the bar area, the bartender was also the waitress for those tables and it was clearly too much for her to keep up with both.  It was obviously not her fault, but I suggest maybe the bar tables not be seated if it is busy and only one bartender is expected to take care of the entire area.  The food was great and we will return.",

She doesn't complain.  But I didn't hear any extra this is so good.    Her husband ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich I believe.  Same response.   It was their first time at the restaurant and while pleased, I didn't feel enthusiasm from them.    They were pleased were the bloody Mary's.

The frosted mint latte is delicious and the french toast combo was very tasty and well worth the money for the size. YOU WILL DEFINITELY LEAVE FEELING FULL!

I had ordered the \"chilaquiles\" plate, and it has to be one of the most disappointing plates I have ever ordered ANYWHERE. I got a bowl of cold, soggy, dry chips, that had too many jalapenos thrown all over and very little chipotle sauce all on the bottom.

Both were great again, tasty and more than enough food. The Blue Cab Cake Sandwich has a hamburger patty size crab cake! It is huge. And, has plenty of crab in it. I had the Sweet Potato Fries for an extra $1. The Chicken & Waffles were huge as always, nice light fluffy waffles with crispy fried chicken. Service was a little lacking this trip, our waitress was trying, but they seemed to be short a server or two for a Saturday night dinner rush. No alcohol this trip, but they do have a full bar, with 5 beers in tap. ( I was surprised that they had no local beers on tap, with all the great Breweries here now) We will be back again",

My fiance and I came here and loved the food. We ordered the famous Andys Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. As well as the Crab cake benedict. Andys sage fried chicken is to die for. Juicy on every single bite with a bit of fluffiness from the waffle. As for me, crab cakes were so tender and the benedict part was mixed in biscuits at the bottom. These are the best biscuits on top of all the ingredients that mixed in with the meal. To top it all off the sauce, is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. whom ever came up with this is genius.   The only reason why I gave them a 3 star was the food got cold quick and our waitress did not come to check on us or give us refills. Overall the eating experience, I would come back every week if I could.",

The inside is very well kept dim lighting I enjoy it not a huge fan of too much lighting. Well I guess it all depends where I'm at during the time.   Let's get started with the menu,  They are a bunch off options I do not drink alcohol but holy moly some of the price were outrageous up to 16.99 for once 12 ounce drink and I'm sure the glass was mostly ice. Although they give you the complimentary glass you can keep it for that price I don't know how the bar there can keep up.  Breakfast and brunch was being served during the time I arrived it was around 11:00 am so I ordered a burger #5 it was outrageously huge I must say. The prices were somewhat okay but I just wish they had more pictures of the meals.  I think they only have the highlight dishes in the menu but it would be great to have a few imagines in each section of the menu it just makes it this much easier to order. The burger was enough for 3 people seriously if I would have known I would have split it with my party. It had god flavor was just to huge for me. All in all the food was good.  My tab was about a 100$ I was a bit shocked I never spend that much on breakfast. Not even the buffet.   The server nonetheless was very nice an attended us very well the staff was very nice   Bathrooms are clean.",

My friend brought me to the Henderson location for my birthday  because I was craving chicken and waffles for breakfast and a really good bloody mary. We came in and were  seated right away, which was nice but they also didn't have many customers. As we are looking at the menu five minutes later our waitress comes to take our order. I ordered a non alcoholic bloody mary and my friend orders  a regular bloody mary along with chicken and waffles.  We get our drinks and I noticed I got a small glass and my friend got a really large glass. I call our waitress and ask her if I could get a bigger glass since all I wanted  was tomato juice. She tells us she doesn't know if she can do it and when I ask why do they put the same drink in diffrent glasses when its the same drink but with out the alcohol, she says that it's  so they can tell the difference between the two and won't get our drinks mixed up. Mind you little does this lady know I am a casino bartender and I am also a casino cocktail server and I have a lot of experience on drinks... I said,  you can just put a different straw, which they had. She gave me a lot of attitude and didn't seem to care to help me so I asked for the manager.  He comes to our table after we whatched them talk about us at the bar as the waitress kept rolling her eyes,  his approach wasn't very nice either.  We asked him if we can get a non alcoholic drink in the same glass as the alcoholic drink since it is the same drink but with out alcohol and he said he would have to charge me for double drinks. Smh. Made no sense and he was rude. When we said we'll cancle our food and pay our drinks  because we wanted  to leave, he said if you want to leave go. Wow! Couldn't believe him. We were going to spend a lot of money and we are very good tippers. First and last time I will ever come here. What a shame because I only live five minutes away and would have came with my husband and kids. Their loss!",

    "text": "My father in law wanted to go here for Father's Day. My wife, kids and I agreed to go for my Father's Day as well.  We arrived with a group of 9 (4 adults, 4 Children, and an Infant).  We waited around for 25 minutes in a restaurant that was about half full, but do to the fact we had a large group we awaited a table.  This is understandable by no means did I expect to get seated right away.  Once we were called for our table I told the hostess that I would need a sling for my infant carrier and she acknowledged me and said \"OK\".   Once we were seated I waited there for a few minutes with an infant carrier on my lap awaiting the sling.  When the waiter arrived I mentioned to him that I asked for a sling and one was never brought to the table.  When he comes back he brings a high chair drops it off and walks off quickly.  I then walked the high chair back and just grabbed a chair to set my child on at this point.  When I go out to eat the main thing I am looking for is service.  I can cook I have done it professionally for many years.  The service was starting off bad and there were not any drinks or food on the table yet.  From the drink order to the order the server was very efficient and helpful with the menu except I asked if I could remove sun-dried tomatoes from the dish.  I wanted to replace it with roasted pepper since my wife has acid problems.   They off course made a big deal and charged me $2 extra for an ingredient that less expensive.  One by one the dishes arrived to the table in about 1 to 2 minute increments.  This I was assuming to keep the food from sitting in the window and becoming old and cold.  Once all of the food was on the table everyone oo'd and aw'd over the portion size we all expected.  What I didn't expect was those roasted peppers I had asked to ensure they were hot for my wife's Hash would come out ice cold and not mixed in.  I sent these back immediately and they ended up very disgusting they had a sour taste like they opened up the can 6 days before.  My wife's eggs were also cold so I sent this back as well the new eggs came out quickly and correct.  My father in law asked for syrup and the waiter brought him honey instead and he had poured it over the waffle already.  He scraped it off and asked for the waiter to get him maple syrup again.  I was surprised after my father in law explained what happen that a new waffle did not find its way to the table.  That is just simply bad customer service.    Now to my dish I had ordered the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which looked amazing, so of course I immediately jumped in and to my surprise it was cold I was so frustrated by this point that I did not even bother sending it back because apparently this staff has no idea how a restaurant is ran.  I can deal with cold food to a curtain degree but it was so under seasoned it was making me sick.  My family and I also went half the meal without our drinks being refilled.  I saw one of the managers hiding in the back not checking on tables, nor did it look like he was trying to run the kitchen.  With a restaurant being so new to the area and everyone having hopes for it to live up to Hash House name you think the staff would be trying a lot harder.  If things do not change at this restaurant I do not foresee it being in Henderson very long.  If they can fix these issues sooner than later they will be a great success they have location, descent pricing, great portions, and well-known brand.  Now they need to focus on the DETAILS, DETAILS, DETAILS.",

    "text": "Tried Hash House a go go about 8 years ago on the other side of town and it wasn't to bad. Liked the fact that everything was huge portions. But our recent visit to the new location in Henderson on 4/5/15, was so awful. The restaurant layout is not toddler friendly, (if you bring a baby and he/she is not able to sit in a booster chair, prepare to wait, aaaa longtime!.We specifically stated when we arrived that our little girl would not fit in a booster seat and would need a highchair. They stated it would be a 10 minute wait...45 minutes later we sat. The hostess stated we don't like to put highchairs to close to other tables, because our plates are so heavy. (Thank you, but why is that my fault your restaurant layout is not kid friendly?, why did you state 10 minutes wait, only to have us wait 45 minutes, then?). By this time i was very agitated and we were just about to leave and they finally sat us.   Then the fun started, The waitress that waited on us was clearly swamped with tables, tons of bussers and hostess running around, but the wait staff was clearly in the weeds. We ordered 10 minutes after we sat, (not bad). we waited another 30 minutes for our food ( a bit much, but understandable because of the amount of people and it being a holiday). But....My daughter got her food first and myself, my wife and the other member in our party didn't get our food at the same time. The waitress stated the food is being staggered because of the volume, again (why is this my fault?). So 1 person in our party gets to eat all their food and then gets to watch us eat when we finally get our food, does that sound right???so again we wait, 5-10 minutes longer, my daughter is half way through her meal when ours finally comes out.  Bottom line in all this, is the manager clearly does not understand how to properly staff for busy times, the restaurant layout is not toddler friendly, the hostesses need to be properly trained to accommodate busy times and provide customers with accurate time frames. I have been around the restaurant business for 30+ years, so i know a thing or two about how a restaurant should be properly ran during slow times as well as busy times / holidays. Unfortunately i will not be frequenting this restaurant again until some serious changes have been made.",

We had a wait of 5 minutes when it was obvious that more than sufficient seating was available. The font on the menu had to be a 10pt. and difficult to read. Our waiter, Robert, who it turns out was also the bartender was busy with the bar and we waited an additional 5 minutes to place our order. I only knew his name because I had to ask since he had no name tag. He caustically told me it was for me to ask him his name so we could build a relationship. What? It was more like being at Walmart when the ambiance consisted of some one screaming out, \"Order up! Runner\".  It's not like we will ever go back because of the food. The bbq chicken sandwich was cold and on the pink side. And, bbq was a misnomer since there was less than a tablespoon of sauce on the entire bun. When we asked for mayonnaise, that was another tablespoon. Again, we will never go back again. What a waste of our money. Upon leaving I asked for a comment card and was told they could give me a piece of paper to leave a note.",

My girlfriends salmon Benedict was cold and not as great as it looked. I didn't finish my basic breakfast combo because I had lost my appetite seeing the hair in my food (which I know was a mistake) but the waiter had showed little remorse and still proceeded to bring us the bill not mentioning anything about the meal being taken off the check. The next time the waiter came around he gestured to the check asking if it was ready, that is when I told him we were not paying for a meal we didn't consume. He then got the manager, the manager then came, talked to us and said everyone in the kitchen wears a hair net and that she'd go check the kitchen and be back momentarily. She had us waiting no joke 15 minutes. I placed what was owed for my girlfriends meal in the check presenter and left. The costumer service was really disappointing, I would have gone back giving the food another chance but unfortunately the staff prevented that.",

The pancake was gigantic heavy and thick, I had to soak that thing in syrup. My sister got the meatloaf which she didn't like ,& my mom got the chicken and waffles and was the only one completely satisfied out of the 3. Being ur 1st time here it took us awhile to order but if the waitress would have explained the menu it wouldn't have taken that long at all. For whatever reason the waitress ended up giving out table to the bartender after our food came idk what that was about. All in all I was not impressed by hash house a go go sadly, maybe I'll give their San Diego location a try & see if they can redeem themselves.",

    "text": "Don't know if this is the right restaurant to review.  There are five other reviews spots for this one location on yelp... and boy they didn't have a good experience either.  This is my second time at this location.  First time my boss wanted me to go for lunch.  I have to say luckily I was with my boss because our wait was over 30 minutes.  The food was OK but the portions were big.  I ordered the Pork Tenderloin.  I guess I am a snob when it comes to this sandwich.  I grew up in Illinois/Indiana and I have to say this was the most bland pork tenderloin I have had.  Thank God for the ketchup and the pickles.  The breading was not great.  The music was very loud... loud enough that we had to scream our order to our waitress.  Our server was Nichoal and she seemed friendly and attentive.  For that visit I would give about a 3 star.  But my family wanted to try this restaurant so we went today.  I WILL NEVER BE BACK.  Our food was slow and came out in shifts.  First plate came out and then my plate which was the last one showed up about 25 minutes later.  My waiter Mike was very apologetic and tried to be accommodating under the situation.  It was still just as loud. I asked for a manager and they acted like they couldn't care less.  You really shouldn't belittle your employees in ear shot of your customers and you probably shouldn't use that same attitude to then speak to your customer.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a second try. We had previously been to another location. The review I am giving is based upon what we ordered. My boyfriend was craving hash so he ordered corn beef hash with scrambled eggs. I wanted an omlette but they don't make omlettes. I thought this was strange. So I ordered a healthy option scrambled egg whites with peppers and mushrooms which was supposed to come with assorted fruit.  OK so the hash wad a big disappointment.  It was only shredded corned beef over wedged potatoes with a little cheese. Not what we expected. Mine egg whites with mushrooms came with red peppers which I didn't really expect. They should probably specify that the peppers are red not green because they taste very different. Instead of an assortment of fruit, my meal came with a watermelon wedge and two orange slices? Eh. They use watermelon wedges and orange slices as garnish on their drinks do I got a side of garnish. We didn't order specialty drinks but saw a few pass by and they looked good. Also saw a really large sandwich pass by us. Maybe you just have to know what to order at this place  a large OJ was $5.99. This place was over priced for us and I doubt we will be back,  though the service was good.",

We understand being in the weeds. But that was far from the issue in this place. We called ahead for our table of six. For 5:30. The place was nearly empty and they still weren't ready for us. It took nearly 10 minutes to get water. And another 10 to get drinks. They messed up my daughters order twice...and when we asked for the chicken we ordered to be on the quesadilla to actually be on it instead of on the side that said they don't do it that way until my husband threw a fit. When we finally got our meals 40 minutes after we sat down they were fine. Just fine. Not enough to make up for the TWO dirty wine glasses, fork that was knocked on the floor by the server and just set back on the table, server arguing with the bartender and SIX employees standing outside the kitchen munching on fries and high fiving each other while we were waiting for service. We will never go back to this location. And there's no way it will survive in its current state anyway. So, next time we want a chicken Benny we will fight the strip rather than the employees.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I had been wanting to try this place out for a while now, having heard how great it was. Well. Our experience was not all that great. We came in around 10:30 on a Sunday morning. We were told the wait time was about 20-25 minutes, which was fine. 35 minutes later... we were seated and noticed a LOT of empty tables and we were left wondering why the wait time took so long if there were so many open tables. Whatever. So by this point it's 11:10 when we finally get situated and start looking over the menu. I wanted the egg scramble with sun dried tomato, basil, and goat cheese but wanted to add some avocado and mushroom. I asked our server if I could add those two items to my meal; apparently the chefs are \"unable to change the ingredients.\" What?! Adding TWO things to my scramble was that much of an inconvenience? I've never heard of such a thing, and I eat out A LOT. She finally relented and made it happen but it was still odd. 35 minutes later we're still waiting for our food and I notice that two groups of people who got sat AFTER us were getting their food BEFORE us. As soon as I was about to ask where the heck our food was, long and behold it finally came. Side note: I asked for fruit on the side, which ended up being ONE piece of honeydew melon... um seriously? That's all the fruit on the side I get? My boyfriend didn't even ask for fruit on the side and he got the same exact thing. Overall, the food was okay at best. Wasn't anything super spectacular. Don't get me wrong, it was good. But not worth all that wait. Service was slow, they weren't very friendly, and the food was okay. That was the first time I went to Hash House A Go Go, and that'll be the last time as well.",

    "text": "I have been a bartender/ server for 6 years so I understand when someone is in the weeds (overwhelmed with too many tables), which Rachel R. seemed to be.  But when she would come to the table she almost never even looked at us. She would pass by and ask \"is everything good\" and immediately be walking away before we could even think of a response. I felt almost offended by her inability too take even a moment with us.  That being said she did get us what we asked for.  On to the food. If you like potatoes and starches this is the restaurant for you. The giant oversized portions are heavy potato and biscuit with little care to the actual vegetable or protein on the dish.   Chicken fried steak was a big burnt piece of gristle with a ton of potatoes and a giant biscuit. To add 2 small eggs that meal is 18.99.  Corn beef wasn't terrible but again a ton of potato and a big biscuit take up most of the skillet for 14.79.  My grandmother had this monolith of a quesadilla. 13.99.  It looked good at first but yet again a ton of potato  inside the quesadilla but for good measure a giant heap of mashed potatoes is underneath. Which is why people probably complement the portion size here.  All dishes came with a sliver of  cantaloupe. We also had a titos bloody Mary 11.99 and a blue moon 5.95.    I have no problem paying 70 dollars for a breakfast if it's delicious or even if the service is good but I left feeling very disappointed. It's called hash house but their hash is really just big cubes of potato. (Maybe I'm crazy but I thought shredded potato with a bit of seasoning was hash browns. Just preference I guess). I dont see myself coming back here again especially since there are so many better places for breakfast/ lunch for less price.  I recommend The Cracked Egg instead.",

I knew and loved this place from when I lived in San Diego and now that there is a brand new location right by my place in Vegas I am beyond thrilled! The best part is this one is open all day not just breakfast like I've always known it to be in San Diego. Had a happy hour cab wine which was good, and the Mac and cheese with bacon yum! The food is ginormous, so if you are not hungry or you are on a diet this would be a bad place for you... Although I guess you could just do a side of oatmeal :/. I have never had a bad meal here and the presentation of the food is just so fun! Great place to bring out of towers who don't know about this gem of a restaurant. This location is great, it's new and clean and the staff was supper nice.",

I personally wasn't impressed with the food, but the Irish coffee was really good. It's \"twisted\" (whatever that means) farm food, so don't be surprised when they don't have white toast, or when your chicken and waffles comes stacked on top of itself for some reason. Additionally, I am looking forward to the sassy clap back of \"sorry you didn't enjoy our twisted farm food, it's just not for everyone #sorrynotsorry\"",

But it was an embarrassing situation for us. Never again!!!asked to get seated for a party of 10. 1 said ok, the wait would be about 45 mins. So we said how about separating our tables. We don't need to sit together. So we are standing there for literally at least 5 mins with the 3 hosts in front of us \"talking in a lower voice\" about where they can seat us, blah  blah, blah. Apparently they go ask a waiter and we overhear them say the waiter didn't want to take a large party. Finally the lady (don't know her name, 1 of them was Stephanie though) Comes back and says, \"actually the wait is 45 mins to 1 hour.\" It was bad service on the hosts and apparently the waiter.  I actually thought that restaurant waiters/servers have to do their job whether its a party of 1 or a party of 10. Didn't know it was optional to accept a large party. Never again!!",

It was an awesome stop on the Strip whenever we visited.   Awesome!!!  The thrill ended there.  This must be the place where they train staff to go work at the Strip restaurant.  We have gone a few times, with hopes each visit would be better.  NOPE.  While the food is \"decent\" maybe 7 times out of 10, and the servers are generally friendly (yet, don't plan on seeing them much, and don't plan on them dressing properly for the job), the restaurant itself is a complete joke.  Henderson, NV is in the Mojave desert, but plan to be seated on the \"bar side\" of the restaurant.  ...The side where the a/c barely works, if at all.  It's RIDICULOUS.  We've been there at prime dinner time more than once.  You WILL be sat next to the bar, whether you want to or not, where the temp hovers around 80-85 degrees on a GOOD day.  However, if you make your way to the bathroom, you will find the other end of the restaurant (the deserted end) is at least 10 degrees cooler.  Oh, and speaking of the restrooms.  We will NEVER return.  The first stall was blood soaked.  And I am NOT exaggerating.  It looked like someone was massacred in this stall.  Blood everywhere.  How's that work for your appetite of overstuffed food on your plate?  One of the most disgusting restaurant experiences I've ever had.",

The filling was scrumptious and creamy with large pieces of carrot and potatoes and a pile of red skinned mashed potatoes hidden underneath.  I had the cobb salad with a side of bacon. The salad was very large and was filled with wonderful blue cheese, bacon bits and large chunks of iceberg that were fresh and crispy.  The tables around us were filled with happy eaters.

How about no greeting when I arrive or whatsoever? How about serving customers that arrive after me? Specifically that my GF and I grab a seat at the bar, the girls behind the bar discuss what they should do next. We can HEAR them. One changes the channel on the TV, March Madness ya know, she's got to keep up with games. We've been sitting for a bit, it's Sunday, right, that's ok. The last straw is serving customers arriving at the bar after us first!Whaaaattt? The vibe for me is that my business is a burden and bothers the servers. We left and found another brunch place. There isn't a shortage in Henderson. I eat out regularly, more than most, it'll never be here again though.",

It's a little cramped and very loud, even for a full house.  I tried their signature Bloody Mary and was unfortunately not very impressed. They don't use horseradish which is a little odd, it was just bland and averagely garnished.   The portion sizes were huge!! You won't leave hungry. And I would say style and quality is comparable to a decent diner, the waffle was the highlight of the meal. I'm an eggs Benedict freak and I felt they take a little too much liberty with a classic, without offering anything close to a True classic version- as in Hollandaise sauce and an English muffin. All and all, we will most likely be back in the future, but not with any urgency.",

Why not drizzle some gravy on the biscuits and then put some on the side to enable the customer to add more if they want to?  I asked for my scrambled eggs well done (as opposed to having an undercooked yolk) and it came back slightly browned and over cooked.

I asked for my booth seat to be wiped down, because it was wet from the dish tray that was clearly imprinted on the seat.  The greeter just got a wet rag and smudged the seat down and walked away.  So, I took the napkin from the table, wiped it down before I could sit down.  Our waitress was okay, nothing special from the norm.  If it's your first time, I say get a burger.  I tried the pork sandwich which was a crazy 10oz of meat that spilled over on the plate.  Overall, this place offers dramatic displays, with decent food.  This pork was not my favorite, but it wasn't terrible either.  Stick with the burgers.    The fries are great, I get them well done and they do a good job on cooking them.  By the way, they only serve that gigantic, free honey biscuit during evening hours.",

My husband had biscuits and gravy, which he said was \"fine.\" That doesn't seem to be an impressive review for the price. I had the buttermilk flapjacks, which apparently is one large flapjack. The problem there is that it seems to get cold too quickly. Mine apparently was already cooling before  they plopped down the ball of butter on top, because it didn't melt. I dragged it around the top for awhile, then just scraped it off to the edge of the plate. I was kind of expecting thick, light and fluffy flapjack(s), but what I got was more of a McFlapjack if you know what I mean. It had that heavy and a little rubbery consistency. It may have started as flour, milk, eggs, etc, but I don't think that happened in this city. I kinda think the mix comes in big hug and they just pour it out onto the griddle.  In all fairness, I came here expecting a breakfast place, and what I got was a bar with an identity crisis. It doesn't seem to know if its a bar or a barn. The waiter's shirt said something about \"Farm Food.\" I guess their farm is in downtown Los Angeles or something. I'm not sure anyone there has done more than drive past a freeway exit that leads eventually to a farm. They seem to be relying on huge portions rather than quality food.",

My boyfriend got the Hash House Original Farm Benedict. They definitely go for presentation over palate. More potatoes than anything on the plate and the flavor was lacking any substance.  Our food did not come out together. I had to ask for 2 more servings of syrup as my first serving was less than half full (and I needed it to soften up my waffle to make it edible), we had to ask for knives since there weren't even butter knives offered on the table, and though the waiter was very nice the woman who brought out our food was not very friendly and I felt like we were putting her out by asking for more syrup & knives.   I doubt we'll ever eat here again even though it's very close to our house. The best things we had were the sausage and my lemonade. Sad.",

I have yet to try their non-breakfast menu because when I think Hash House I think delicious bigger-than-your-head Snickers (or whatever you have a taste for) pancakes and delicious country potatoes. I've dined with others who have ordered the French toast, omelettes, and hashes and they all leave satisfied, as I always do, too! You seriously cannot leave this restaurant still hungry. While the food is always great, in my experiences the service has been a little on the slower side and getting a drink refill may take longer than it should, but the dining room is consistently busy and the servers generally boast a positive attitude despite the (at times) hectic atmosphere.",

When we were ready to order we asked our server if I could substitute breakfast potatoes instead of what they offered.  The waitress automatically said NO , when we asked why . Her answer was because we are not allowed l. My husband asked do you have the potatoes already made . Waitress said yes.. but you still cannot do that. We asked , can we speak to a manager , the waitress SAME her order book closed amd walked away.  5 minutes later the manager came over. She apologized , got us a new server and convinced us to stay (we were about to leave ).  I ordered the Mushroom burger (being a vegatarian).. it was HORRIBLE. . The mushroom was completely burnt .. and I couldn't even eat it after one bite.  My husband ordered the corn beef sandwhich. He had no comaints..  Because of the RUDE service and HORRIBLE food I WILL NOT BE A 3rd time customer.   And the sad thing is the day we went in , it wasn't even busy. . And it still took forever.",

The texture was slimy inside and the flavor was oddly sour. Not pumpkin-y at all. They replaced with a regular pancake which was acceptable.  I say acceptable because, for the price of breakfast, I expect something better. Their pancake syrup is not very maple-y. Is it supposed to be vanilla syrup?   Another person in our party ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict.  I sampled it and it was very tasty.   We've been 3 times to this location. I've ordered something different every time, and I've been disappointed with my order every time. I want to like this place more. The items on the menu all sound really good. But in reality? Meh.",

Wife's scramble I could have made at  home easily.  I grew up on a farm in Illinois, so I eagerly ordered the Tenderloin Sandwich. It looked good but was dry and flavorless.    Now for the tragedy. Warning, this is not for the faint of heart: I paid an extra dollar to get the sweet potato fries. When they were delivered I asked for Ranch dressing, and the waiter promptly informed me (as if he gets this question at least 50 times a day)  \"We only have cucumber ranch.\"   Cue record scratch here.   NO RANCH!   I'm pretty sure this is still America, where every restaurant should have Ranch on hand. By not having Ranch, its almost an abuse of trust to even offer sweet potato fries. At least put it in bold ALL CAPS: \"NO RANCH\" next to the sweet potato fries listing. Like its for people with cucumber allergies.   Whoever thinks cucumber ranch would be an acceptable alternative to normal ranch, needs to go back to the farm for a refresher.   I bet the cucumber ranch would be good as a face mask though.",

We found parking right away and were seated immediately after walking in. After being seated, we were given menus and were told that the server would take our order shortly. The server came, didn't bother asking us if it was our first time there or if we wanted any recommendations. She just took our order and left. After several minutes, someone delivered biscuits without saying anything to us. Since it was our first time there, we didn't know that they had biscuits instead of a bread basket, which most restaurants offered. The biscuit was alright, nothing extraordinary. The jam tasted like Smuckers, right from the jar.  We ordered HH famous sage fried chicken. The cream was too heavy and the chicken was dry. I liked the mashed potatoes and the not-so-crispy bacon.  We knew the order is huge so my husband and I decided to share it. The server knew we were sharing the order but didn't bother giving us plates. Service really lacks at this location. Maybe because they know it's mostly locals who frequent them. I'm sure customer service at HH on the Strip is better because the servers really work hard for their tips.",

I figured it was like pico de galo where it is just cooked with a little bit of onions. Just to warn you about that one. And the hot chocolate isn't good either. It just looks good.",

Our server was in the weeds, Im assuming due to staffing issues, it was hard for him to be attentive we didn't get our drinks refilled, the service is REALLY disappointing.Be prepared to wait for your food, but the food is good.",

No tip for the server that day.  Didn't even come refill anyone's drinks even when we asked and I had to get the manager to even get my damn check.

We made reservations and were quite surprised we didn't need them; the restaurant was not crowded at all.  Our server, Eddie, was awesome.  He knew about the coupon I presented before I told him what it was, and he gave us plenty of time to look over the menu.  We shared the fried green tomatoes appetizer - it was incredible, so tasty.  I had the chicken & waffles (had to!) and my sis had the fried chicken Benedict.  Yum.  I had the wine spritzer with mango & pineapple...delicious!  Sis had a mojito which was also very good, but she liked mine better and ordered one of those too!  My daughter had a big pancake which made her very happy.  Eddie gave us one of the drinks on the house, which was unexpected and really appreciated!  Although I had the Travel Zoo deal, we agreed that we would've gladly payed full price for this meal.  Will stop here again when we visit Vegas next time.",

The service was kinda slow and we got someone else's bill before pointing that out to the server.  I almost didn't say anything because it was less than what I expected our bill to be...but then when we got our actual bill, I was rewarded with good karma because it was even less than the other party's bill.

I had the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict, and boy, they weren't kidding with that mountain of hash potatoes!

I've been here twice now and the second time it was even worse. The host on both occasions was unfriendly and she looked acted like she didn't want to be there at all.  My server on my first visit was actually friendly but she did seen rushed.  The other staff seemed uninterested.  On my second visit the staff was very unorganized and not focused on their tables. It felt like they were there to get the tables out asap.  When she took our order she seemed irritated and not genuine. I asked to substitute a side and she rolled her eyes at me and said it was not possible. I explained it was on the first visit and she never said anything about it again up until I got my food.  I've waited 30-40 min for a drink I ordered and I don't mind that when it's busy but it was simply because there was no staff at the bar (I was sitting next to it)  besides what I believe was the manger but she was on the phone for a while looking at all the tickets that came out of the printer but not doing anything about it.  Overall the staff gave me a feeling that they are demotivated and my experience has been unpleasant regarding customer service but like I said I love the food. If I'm going back I'll probably go to a different location. Hopefully the service will be as good as the food.",

Well here the prices are good and you get \"GOOD\" portions and depending on how hungry you are you'll get two (or three) small servings of food on your plate. It depends on what you order. I ordered the stuffed meatloaf which includes: carrots, green beans, lots of thick mashed potatoes, and two slices of meatloaf which turned out to be two meals for me. I don't know if they have dessert (I'm always too full to get it), but if they do I'd recommend you eat half your meal and then get dessert. \"Yes, the portions are that big!\" Overall I would say my eating experience here has always been good.",

So we entered hash house but now we know why it wasn't very full here.  I ordered coffee and I asked if they had any flavored creamer and the waiter said they didn't. He did go on and try to explain to me that he has spoken to management about providing flavored creamer. We then start to order our food to only find out that they also don't have sourdough bread or white bread to go with our breakfast. They only provide wheat or Rye. Well that sucks. When the food arrived to our table the french toast that my daughter ordered was so cold and soggy. Aside from not liking wheat toast our food was ok I guess. Not really going back to eat here. Otherwise the staff was nice it's just my food was not very good.",

The restaurants ambience adds to this effect. The staff was very professional and patient in aiding the funeral staff and the clients orders.  The manager of the establishment even made his rounds to the back of the restaurant to ensure that all was well for us and we did not need anything.",

The location is super clean, friendly staff, comfortable and inviting ambience too. The bathrooms are always something I judge restaurants on and it was immaculate in there. The food is amazing but the service just is the cherry on top! If you love the 'Hash House a Go Go' then don't go to the strip or any other location, this is sooo worth going out of your way if you're coming to eat here and don't forget to request Dulce as your server! She truly is an amazing server!! Oh yeah and don't forget to come hungry... the portions are huge even for the kiddos :)",

    "text": "So having visited the HHAGG a few months ago on the strip, I was excited to see that there was a location in Henderson - near our hotel - open for dinner!  I took the servers recommendation of the griddle Meatloaf, with 2 eggs.  It came with mashed potatoes, fruit, and a biscuit.    We started with the fried green tomatoes.  Green - a bit too green - had to have a knife to cut.  We just couldn't find anything about the dish that inspired us.  The seasoning was off, the aioli was off - not sure what it was - but the whole thing just wasn't hitting our palates right.  The meatloaf was massive - but again - nothing really jumped out and said OMG this is good.  Ate about 1/2 of it and pushed the plate away.  TOO many potatoes, NOT ENOUGH gravy/sauce - and what we had was thick as paste.  The biscuit - over cooked - hard - HARD exterior - the interior was ok... but disappointing as well.  The whole plate was thick, heavy, and more bland than I would have expected.  Lots of food, not a lot of excitement. Such an opposite experience from their signature breakfast hash.",

She returns and says again, \"Yes, it must be printed.\"  Imagine how many people who would have \"about faced\"...the business lost. I asked to speak to the manager. He comes out and I say what if you don't own a printer? I'm a frequent Hash House patron, spent plenty of money. He immediately suggests I forward it to him and he'd print it. Problem resolved!

We got there around noon and there was about a 20 minute wait which isn't bad. The table we sat at was really small and the place was packed so we couldn't ask for a different table. They have so many options on the menu for whatever you're craving. After we order the food came out within 15 minutes! Everything was hot and exactly how we ordered it. We got the pineapple mimosa which I would highly recommend! I would give it 5 stars but the portions are just wayyy to big. I hate wasting food and it's an outrageous amount of food that you are served. There is a guarantee that you won't leave hungry! I would highly recommend this place if you're super hungry.

The food portions are astronomical, so either bring a maaaajor appetite (a visit to a local cannabis dispensary before would be recommended) or plan to share a dish with someone. Nichole took amazing care of my friend's and I (my friends had gotten married nearby that morning). Nichole was fast, friendly, and efficient. She clearly knew what she was doing and was on top of everything. I had the safe fried chicken this time (I usually do the chicken n waffles, but switched it up slightly). Nichole was a master of up-selling (I'm glad I got the gravy and the extra syrup and was worth it). Visit Vegas regularly for work and make it a point to visit Hash House each time I'm here. Nichole deserves a raise! Thanks for taking amazing care of us last weekend!",

It was served on a bed of skillet potatoes that were kind of bland and overcooked. Probably pass next time. We've had better  Griddled French toast - one of our favorites, served with griddled bananas. Almost tastes like bananas foster with the Carmelized bananas with syrup and butter over the thick sliced toast. We had the combo with scrambled eggs and bacon. The bacon was real smoky and thick cut. Still amongst the top of their dishes.  Beat Salad - this is a big salad with sliced red and gold beets over a bed of romaine. It had sliced globe tomatoes and dressed with balsamic, feta cheese and candied walnuts. Comes with a side of balsamic vinaigrette. If you like beet salads this was a winner",

No Miscato in the lineup at this time. 8 ( .... the kids menu is loaded with more options then most places. FYI. .. the ladies restroom has large gaps where the stall walls attach behind the toilets. .. if you don't want an audience avoid the middle stall and the first stall if you do not wish to be an audience member.

I had always passed by the original HH in San Diego and saw the never-ending long lines to be seated, so this was my first time delving into the deliciousness that is Hash House. The myriad of flavors combined with the plethora of options left me engorged and satisfied. As a party of 4, we only needed 3 entrees to more than fill us up. *Chicken & Waffles rivals Roscoe's thanks to the homemade soy sauce. *Pub Crawl had very savory corned beef that is cured on site. *Pecan French Toast with fried banana was almost too sweet. Almost. Oh, and the Bloody Mary was spicy, which I appreciate greatly. It comes with bacon, tomato and lettuce at the top of the cup. Strange way to prepare it, but \"you had me at bacon.\" Great service, too. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and gave good recommendations.",

Place was half empty when we arrived at 7:00 pm and still had to wait for 20 minutes to get a table.  Once seated we had to wait for drinks, and food that finally arrived at 8:20.  We actually never had a server, but 3 different people that never really helped.  I asked for a side ranch with my fries and the waitress just dumped it at the table without a word.  Sweet potato fries were horrible and the burger I got was dried out!  Side note: went for breakfast this morning and they stated there was a wait of over an hour and there were at least 15 tables empty!!!!!! Won't be going here again.",

Literally no one was in there besides the staff and they still took a little while before they got everything together and sat us down. When we sat down, we all noticed our forks and knives were pretty dirty. My 11 year old asked for new utensils and the guy was being a bit snarky and said he would bring us new ones. Bringing us new ones didn't help half of us bc they were still frickn dirty. Then our waitress was super clumsy dropping menus and whatever else was ever in her hand while she was serving us and forgetting drinks. Only one of us in our party got a refill on soda. The food was subpar as well. The women's bathroom was decent and mostly clean, according to the gentlemen in my party the men's bathroom was a disgusting mess. I am not at all impressed with the service, cleanliness, or quality of food at this location. I went to the location in the Plaza Hotel and enjoyed myself...maybe I'll go back there before I write this place off completely.",

I only ate one because  cold runny egg is not very pleasing to eat. I turned my other cold egg over and it was black on the bottom so whatever skillet it was cooked in (not the one delivered to my table mind you) was dirty so there was no way I was going to eat the remaining cold egg.   The servers were really nice but their cooks ruin the experience. My mothers toast were burnt. ALL THREE were burnt so if you can't toast bread what does that say about your food?

First off all they fail to tell anyone that it's a limited menu. And that would have been fine but they failed to execute anything right. Food was cold, well, warmish at best. The wait staff was totally inattentive.  Seemed like they were doing us a favor by working there.  Needless to say, I will not be going back there again.

Actually, she walked away right before we could speak. 2. The creamer we had look spoiled because it was curdling in our coffee. We asked if we could get another one and the waiter poured the coffee out and just added new coffee to the cup. How could you tell? You see coffee splatters outside of the mugs. 3. 30 min into our meal we still haven't received our pancakes, which one would think would be the first thing to come out of the kitchen.

It wasn't too sweet and refreshing. When the food came out, the portions were HUGE! The corned beef was fresh (not the mushy kine you get in the can) and chicken benedict was very filling with layers of fried chicken, scrambled eggs, fried pasta strings, cheese, and biscuits. FYI, order the sauce on the sauce or else your fried chicken and grilled potatoes will become soggy. The only thing that was a negative was that there weren't enough blueberries in the pancakes. The pancakes were like small pizza sized so it would be nice that the filling/toppings are a little generous as well to balance the dish. Other than that, I would come here again for breakfast to try the other dishes. If you're super hungry, Hash House A Go Go has very filling, american comfort food with generous portions.",

    "text": "Like most of the reviewers, we did not have the best experience at this location.   We have actually been here twice: once  during their 'family' soft opening and once a week later when they were actually open. The first time, although brief, was not the most pleasant. We walked in following another couple and were greeted by a host who told us they weren't really open.... They were packed. They turned away both of us and told us to come back when they open. The host was kinda rude. They almost lost customers that day.  The second time we came we were told there was a 45 min. wait or we could sit at the bar. The obvious choice was the bar. We looked around and saw tons of tables open...why was there a 45 minute wait? The bartender was cool and took our order but things went south quickly. We ordered a specialty pancake and the chicken and waffles. It took almost 45 minutes to get our food and they brought us extra food. They brought the pancake out without the eggs and bacon I ordered, then the chicken and waffles, and then ANOTHER pancake with the meal. Anyone who has been here before knows that portions are not small here. The waiter said we could take the extra one home since they'd \"have to throw it out anyway.\" So we ate our food which was pretty good- hence two stars. However, the bill came and we were charged for the extra pancake that we never ordered and were told to keep. The bartender took it off the bill and all was well.   There is obviously something wrong with the staff or management at this place because they're inconsistent. While we ate our food, a lady sat down, ordered the same thing we did and was brought her food within minutes. The managers/ owners don't seem to be so organized. We might give it another try, but I don't know.",

First, this location is quite compared to its sister location on Sahara, which is nice when you haven't even had coffee yet. Second, the wait is still long, but they are pretty friendly and keep menus at the check in so you can browse around the food items. I will warn you, the portions here are HUGE, so come hunger. The service is good, they are very good on refills. I would suggest The Komokko ( I'm pretty positive I spelt that wrong) it is the sandwich with meatloaf and cheese. It was so amazing, but I could not finish it. It's a little pricey, but it's good food and you will not leave disappointed.",

My main complaint though is how uncomfortable the seating is. We were seated in the bar area and while I can't speak for the restaurant portion, those metal chairs are uncomfortable. The tables seemed low and too narrow for the size of the plates. Add on the ridiculous garnish and the giant knife sticking out of every plate and you start to feel like a juggling act. The layout of the tables is a bit awkward if you have any sort of assistive devices. A party with a walker that was seated further in had a bit of trouble getting between the table and a divider chain between the tables and restaurant. Ultimately they had to pull the walker through leaving their party member to walk those few feet without it. Given the totality of the experience I doubt I will give them a third try.",

The one women held up a finger and continued to ignore us. As we stood in front of the stand about 2 feet away, I swear to god a server walked right between us and the hostess stand. So close that we had to step back. And she giggled. I said to my husband loud enough for all three to hear me that if we were not seated in the next minuet we needed to leave. NOTHING.

First the menu is varied and a bit confusing so my friends needed more time we ordered water with lemons since there was three of us we asked that the lemons be in a separate dish we were told that was an extra charge. Our meal came with a sauce but there was very little sauce so we asked for more sauce. Again we were told \" that would be extra\" why is it our fault the pork was fried and dried out ? I asked for the manager Lelani although polite she explained that there was a miscommunication. Bottom line she did not put the extra charge for the sauce. The portions may be Hugh but the quality just was not there. The overall service needs improvement and management lacks customer service skills.",

When we got here it was full which is fine I expected a long wait, total wait time to be seated was 55 minutes. We sit down and notice there are tables all around us that are open, I figured they are short staffed so ok fine. We sat down and ordered immediately since we had 50 minutes to look over the menu. Almost one hour later still no food! Tables around us that sat down 20-30 minutes after us already had their food. We were only a table of 4 so why the long wait? Our waitress comes and tells us that there was a mistake with the slips and our order as well as a few others never got placed. We asked to speak to a manager and our waitress came back and offered 25% off. Fine, because we were starving. Food came out about 10 minutes later. Food was great, our waitress was great, but the experience was one of the worst, ever! I don't feel that 25% off our meal was enough for the neglect we experienced. I mean really, eating breakfast should not take a whole 2 and a half hours.",

    "text": "If you've never been to Hash House, consider as Claim Jumper 2.0. It's a little newer and the menu's a bit more refined. The portions are comically large, and the clientele tends to be the type of people who aren't particularly interested in portion control. A lot of older people seem to enjoy this place. That's not a bad thing, but it's a great place to bring your parents.   I had previously eaten at other Hash House locations and had a decent experience. How this location has the same menu, there seems to be something up with the running of this place.   First, there are a lot of people. It's a popular place, so there's a line. But to me that's not the issue. There were only two of us, so we only waited about 10 minutes. But ten we sat there another 40 minutes waiting for our food. The fact we both ordered salads makes the wait even more ridiculous.  When the food did come, that was the last we saw of our waitress for a while. Occasionally she would wonder by assuring us we're doing ok. Not once were we offered a refill during our meal. It was only after the plates were being cleared did the waitress ask if we wanted deserts or another drink.   It's a shame the service sucks, because it's decent food and nice restaurant. I'm assuming right now there's so much business the management doesn't much care about the service level. I'm guessing they'll care a bit more in a year or so when the novelty of being new wears off.  Update: I'm going to update this to a 1 star review. The food is good, but there is sincerely something wrong with the service. Every time I go, I seem to run into a different problem. And DO NOT attempt take out. In the half a dozen times we've tried this, there has never been a time they have got it right. Every time requires me to go back there and get something they left out. And they genuinely don't concern themselves about this. The manager is about as apathetic as can be.   Decent food, but if you can try difference location. Not sure what's going on, but there's just something that prevents these guys from getting it right.",

I'd recommend planning to wait if you're wanting to try it.  We sat and were greeted promptly by our server but she was not knowledgable about the menu and said their was no special tonight because the kitchen had made a \"major mistake today\". Awkward start but we had the drink and food order ready since we had chosen while waiting.  Drinks came but we had to wait 15 minutes for my husband's beer.... And then our food just never came. 45 minutes after we sat down the server came back to ask what we had ordered.  We ended up leaving because we had a 3 year old in tow and were over sitting for almost 90 minutes with no sign of food in sight. Anyone with kids knows the nightmare of a hungry kid and extended sitting still.   After chatting with the manager who was a total rockstar and seemed completely on her game we realized this was a server issue BUT I spent years in the restaurant business and a server without experience is not equipped to work at a restaurant with a detailed menu and just opening kinks.  We may try again for lunch and see if we have a better experience. I'll update if we do.",

The food was larger than life portions with everyone taking home leftovers, but the pot pie looked like a salad with more veggies than chicken and a large biscuit shell that resembled hard tack! The sauce was thin, runny and tasteless. They would have done better nuking me a Marie Calendars frozen pot pie and bringing that out. We were very disappointed with this visits food expediting and overall taste.",

    "text": "So extremely disappointed.  I had been to the Hash House at the M back when it was still open there and the dinner was pretty good, especially the biscuit.  Fast-forward to this morning when a friend and I had breakfast at the HH on Stephanie to understand my disappointment.  A place called Hash House should have actual hash, should it not?  When I ordered the corned beef \"hash\" today it showed up in what looks like a large cast-iron skillet, but it appeared to be just for show, because nothing in there was cooked in that skillet.  My corned beef \"hash\" was just a bunch of pulled corned beef with melted swiss on top, then just thrown on top of some breakfast potatoes.  The corned beef was decent, but what part of \"hash\" does the Hash House not understand?  On top of the disappointing breakfast my stomach was upset most of today, and that is not a common occurrence.  I hate to blame HH, but I'm pretty sure HH was the reason for today's discomfort.  My friend got the biscuits and gravy and was extremely disappointed as well.  Although he said the sausage gravy was good, he also said the biscuits were like rock-hard paperweights.  For the prices we paid it should have been an above-average breakfast.  Unfortunately, it was one of the most disappointing breakfasts we could remember.  The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is due to the service.  The place was quiet, very clean, and our waitress was very friendly and attentive to our needs.  She was the only positive part of our breakfast.",

Wait time was only 10 min, but instead of being greeted, I was given the index finger and told \"hold on\". (For the first day, I would have put a greeter at the door. First impressions are everything). It was surprising because it was right in front of a camera crew and people who looked like they may have been investors. So, I was expecting super sweet smiles and greetings.   When we sat down, my silverware wasn't clean (Again, really?! On the first official day open?!)   The waitress was good, but a little snooty about the substitution rule. (Sorry! I didn't know this place didn't do substitutions! I have a lot of restrictions I need to work around.... And aren't \"no substitution\" rules for fancy establishments? Just saying...)   My eggs ordered \"over medium\" came out cold and runny.    I find that I'm impressed when places get \"over medium\" correct because 9 times out of 10, they do come out runny. But cold AND runny was a first.   My meal was luke warm like it had been sitting. My husband's meal was very good, but he said he had a couple bites of potato that weren't done. We don't like to complain, so we didn't send anything back.   It took two requests to get a box for the leftovers.   Look, I know it was the first few hours of officially being open. I know the staff was a bit overwhelmed (even though the restaurant wasn't full, but I can imagine first day jitters)... The location is great and so is the potential, so we'll give it another shot and see if warrants the other two stars in the future. :)",

All plates are visual abominations, cooking execution errors abound, from greasy sage chicken and waffles assembled with giant skewers and thickets of fried leeks akin to the the working end of a kitchen broom, to the inedible thickness of anything involving bread, to coagulated sauces and gravies, to gross, sticky drinks - there's not much redeemable here.    Oh and I'll probably go back.  Because sometimes I hate myself and crave True rock bottom.",

    "text": "Ate here with my wife for what I figured was going to be dinner, but wasn't really.  We had been to the Hash House a Go Go at the M Resort before that location closed and were pleased with the meal we had then, so we figured we'd try the Henderson location as it's the closest to where we live.    We arrived at about 7:30 and were told there would be about a 10 minute wait, even though there were tables available on both sides of the restaurant . After only about 5 minutes we were seated.  I always find it strange when a couple is seated at a table for four, when there are tables for two available.  It seems like poor planning.  Anyway, after we were seated we waited several more minutes for our server to take our drink orders.  While we waited, we scanned the menu to find that there were no dinner options, only breakfast and brunch.  We asked our server where the dinner menus were but this location is only serving brunch until they \"get up to speed\" - kind of strange to me, as they've been open for 10 days, and have multiple locations in town.    Since dinner was out, and that's what my wife and I had planned for we really had to struggle to find what we wanted to eat.  We had both read the online menu before leaving the house, so we had our minds set on certain meals, only to have to change ideas at the last moment.  I'd had their stuffed burger at their M Resort location and thought it was pretty good, though lacking seasoning, so I figured I'd try one again.  Although my wife and I debated about getting the chicken pot pie we each went with the stuffed burger.  She selected the Swiss and mushroom burger, while I wanted the Cheddar burger, but I also wanted bacon on it.  When I asked the server if they could add bacon, he said he would add a side of bacon.  At the M Resort location every meal came with a biscuit, and their biscuits were about the size of a saucer.  When I asked our server if our meals came with a biscuit, he said they didn't, but he would add one, so I said we'd each want one.  It took quite a while for us to get our food, I had ordered the biscuits in hopes they would come first as a sort of appetizer as we were both very hungry, however they came with the meal - sort of.  My burger came out first, without bacon.  Then after a few minutes I got my biscuit, when I asked where my wife's biscuit was the waiter said he thought we had only wanted one, and would send out another.  My wife received her burger next, then finally my bacon and our second biscuit.    The burgers are large - 2 1/2 pound patties, but it's almost as if they don't season them when they're being fried, there's very little flavor.  My wife's Swiss and mushroom burger had only one detectable mushroom, but so much Swiss it was sliding off the burger - that's a good thing about the Swiss though!  My burger had a nicely flavored cheddar, but it wasn't oozing out like my wife's Swiss was.  I also find that the bun which is very bland also takes flavor from the burger.  The fries are very plain, with little flavor as well.  The Mac-n-Cheese is not what I had expected - it's thin, with an artificial cheese flavor - lacking substance and just not satisfying.    And then there were the biscuits - The one's at M Resort were large, soft and fluffy, flaky, and full of flavor.  My first biscuit was so hard, I couldn't cut it in half.  When I asked the server if this is how the biscuit was supposed to be, she said she didn't know, she had never had their biscuits.  So we got two more that were fresh out of the oven - they were better, but still hard and very dry and very small.    We were also given some sort of jam (?) with the biscuits - we were never told what it was, even though we got 4 containers of them, and the butter that came with the jam was only about 1/4 of the container.  I had to ask twice more for more butter - and each time only got 1/4 of a container - butter shortage?    Won't be back to this location for a while - might stop in again if they start serving dinner - but can't see ever getting the burger again.  They've got a long way to go, and staff needs to be educated much better (have to ask for everything, ask for refills of drinks, remind servers that you need certain items, etc.) before this location can really carry the Hash House a Go Go name.",

Our waitress took our lunch order and we happily waited for our food. But that was our only complaint, we waited and waited and waited for our food. We arrived at the restaurant around 11:30 and did not leave the restaurant until 1:50. We waited for our food for more than 45 minutes. And then waited to get our check back for a good 10 minutes. Yet our waitress checked in with us twice apologizing for the wait and another lady brought all three of us gift cards because we waited so long. Our waitress told us that there was only two of them and that the kitchen staff was short handed as well. The food was great though! We all enjoyed the food and had no complaints in that department. We were understanding and did not complain to any of the staff about the wait time, and we appreciated that they took the time to check in with us. Overall I would love to go back since we liked the food but it felt like half our day was wasted just waiting for our food.",

Eventually someone came to the front grabbed 2 menus and mumbled something that I could not understand. We followed her to the table (she was a good 12 steps ahead of us), where she then kept mumbling as she walked off into the distance.   We looked over the menus for a good 18 minutes before someone eventually came over and asked in a way that they seemed bothered by our presence if we were ready to order. I guess that was our server?? The next time we saw any employee was when some other person came and delivered our food (if you're counting, that's 3 employees that all looked to be having a bad month). Our server never came and asked how anything was or if we needed anything else. Eventually the hostess came over to refill our drinks (didn't know that was in her job description but, thank you!). At the end of our meal the server came by and asked if we needed a box, then dropped our check off. Horrible service! Horrible attitudes! BUT, the food is wonderful.   In conclusion, I will return to HH but not this location. We will try another one and see how it goes!",

It's rare to find a restaurant that can perfectly poach your eggs - but alas look no further - the yolks popped upon puncture, whites fully cooked. We also got the biscuits and gravy. I cannot say enough how the fresh ingredients are really the star of the show. It defines Hash House.  To top things off the service was wonderful! The host was welcoming, the server was friendly, accurate, and prompt. The food came out in a timely manner. The environment was warm. Tyler, the GM, was outstanding! The level of community service that the restaurant is involved with is noteworthy. I will always promote and recommend locally ran businesses that promote social awareness...Hash House is a winner all the way around.  We look forward to our next visit!",

My teenager got the Biscuits and Gravy with scrambled eggs and could barely finish half of it.  Most of the time when we dine out, he finishes his and then starts picking at mine!  It's nice that I don't have to share my meal with them!  My little one got the pancake, eggs and bacon which is nice because he got a little bit of everything he likes.  I indulged in their super yummy hot chocolate and their pumpkin pancake.  Overall, a great place to come for breakfast/brunch.  I'm going to have to try to venture here for dinner sometime since we've always come for breakfast/brunch!",

I'm not sure this would've been the case with hotel locations like the Linq.  I also noticed that the menu prices were cheaper than the menu prices of the hotel locations, about $1 cheaper.  We ordered the Crab Cake Benedict and Andy's Sage Fried Chicken.  Portions were HUGE.  The crab cake benedict was delicious but I felt it came out with way too much extra garnishes. The dish got really messy without much structure.  As for the fried chicken, the skin was sooo delicious!!!!   I liked that they were served with a large portion of fruit (strawberry and cantaloupe ) which was a refreshing way to end the meal.  For drinks we ordered the Caramel All Over Mocha (you have a choice of hot or cold) and the instagram worthy \"famous smores mocha\") .  Both were massive!!!  We could not finish either one but the waitress offered to go cups, which I thought was a nice touch I was not expecting.  Would make the drive out again !",

I decided on the chicken and waffles for brunch today and it was a hit. The sage friend chicken breast was cooked perfectly and super juicy. The bacon waffle was just the right amount of crisp on the outside and fluffy in the middle. So yummy. Since it was brunch time we had to have a mimosa. I went with the deep eddy that has cranberry vodka, asti and tangerine juice. The bartender accidentally made 2 so the waitress gave me a second one on the house. Two thumbs up as I stumble out of here. Lol",

I dont think restaurants realize the necessity of having both pancakes AND waffles on the menu, they're like apples and oranges in my opinion. I notice other people prefer one or the other too, this allows a large group with varying tastes to easily settle on an order. Some people like breakfast items whenever or just in the morning, HHaGG serves \"breakfast\" food all day, which is another huge plus! If youre taking teenagers and kids out for lunch, like we did, you can not go wrong with this place.   Their portions are very generous, even though I liken this place to a Denny's or IHOP, that vague comparison is where it stops because I consider HHaGG food a better taste and quality. Eggs were a big reason why. I've had eggs at all 3 of these places and HHaGG is the only one to have a nice fluffy consistency and cooked just right.  Im giving it 4 out of 5 stars because if your mobility is hindered in anyway - wheelchair, cast, poor vision, etc. - the aisles are narrow and it will be hard to maneuver the place. Ask staff to help assist you when navigating the area, I didn't have to ask but I'm sure they would have obliged. They do have wheelchair ramps inside and outside though, so that's a start!",

When you walk in they have \"best restaurant 2014\" hanging on the wall, nothing's probably changed since then. Coffee was burnt, waitress recommended a blueberry pancake- the blueberries were sour. The quesadilla we ordered was drenched in sauce and had 1/2lb of jalapenos in the first quarter.  For the price you'd find a much better breakfast elsewhere (It's pricey). Also everything is \"Indiana\" themed- being from the state nothing here felt familiar.",

This brings me to my issue- the service is always \"meh\" in this place.  This particular time, we had a large group- and it took the server (who was also the bartender on the other side of the restaurant) 15 minutes to come over and say hello.  We constantly were asking for our server and it got to be annoying.  Our group consisted of about 5 former servers (so we have extra empathy), but at some point, it just gets to be too much.  Finally, when the bill came, he said he couldn't split checks.  Again, I used to work as a bartender/server with the same system this company uses.  I know you can split bills- it's just inconvenient for the server to do.  It's a lazy issue, simple as that.   We still tipped 20%.  Let me use this platform to say:  Even with bad service, you need to tip decently.  Don't take it personal and tip the few extra bucks.   So, all in all, meh.",

    "text": "I've been here twice in a month and I wish I hadn't returned after the first visit. I get it, the portions are massive and the plates are decorated ridiculously. But let's be real, the food tastes like Denny's at best and will tear your stomach up like the worst diner. It's all hype.  My first visit wasn't great. I made reservations since it was for a Sunday morning. We still wound up waiting for about 15 minutes past our reservation time, despite checking in 5 minutes early. The hostesses were rude and cold. We sat in Yvette's section, which you should avoid doing if you can. It took a while to order drinks. Once we did, my friend's cocoa took at least 10 minutes. Because Yvette forgot it. She tried to play it off like she was a ditz and it wasn't cute. For some reason, they decorate the top of the cocoa as well as the entire saucer and then stick the cocoa mug on top of the chocolate-covered saucer. Even the handle had sticky chocolate sauce on it and it wasn't easy to drink. I got the bacon and avocado scramble with crispy potatoes and a side of gravy. It was bland and actually much smaller than I was anticipated, judging by the massive plates that were being brought to other tables. I never got a refill on my iced tea and it took forever for our waitress to check on us, to bring the check, etc.  I went back today because my grandma was super hungry and wanted to try a new breakfast place. Black Bear Diner (our usual spot) has been letting us down lately so I figured Hash House would be much better, especially on an early weekday morning. Nope. Same waitress. The place was pretty empty and it still took forever for her to greet us and to bring our drinks.   I got the Nashville hot chicken sandwich which was plenty hot, but not a sandwich. It's literally a boneless chicken breast on top of one piece of dry-griddled Texas toast. How is that a sandwich??? The chicken was twice the size of the bread, so it's not like I could fold the bread taco-style either. The flavor was disgusting. It was like eating a spoonful of cayenne pepper. No other flavors at all. The fries are done in the style of Taco Bell's nacho fries, only somehow worse. Terrible seasoning all over them. The little bug crawling on my obnoxious rosemary spear was a nice touch too. Again, never got a refill. Thankfully, my mom got an ice water with her cup of coffee so I was able to drink that when I ran out of tea. I immediately felt sick after eating my food. Let's just say it's the fastest I've ever made it home from Henderson and it almost wasn't fast enough.  The giant portions and the way they plate their food is cool, but there are better (and local-owned) spots around town that deliver tastier food!",

    "text": "Wow! Food was amazing and talk about big portions! I wanted to try their signature Andy's Fried Chicken and Waffles, but also try their Blue Crab Cake Sandwich...actually there were SO many options that looked good to try...I almost couldn't decide. Luckily, when ready to order, my sister told the waitress she wanted the Blue Crab Cake Sandwich...so I suggested that we share it and she could have some of my chicken and waffles since I felt that I really should try their signature dish upon my first visit there. So glad we did this so I could try both...and both were amazing! The fried chicken batter was full of flavor even the batter for the waffles had flavor even without syrup. There's about 3 or 4 waffles and a generous amount of chicken to top with a dinner knife piercing it upon presentation(their signature \"look\"). I believe there's supposed to be pieces of bacon drizzles over the waffles and chicken but since I don't eat pork or beef, I asked for it on the side. They brought me a generous amount of bacon in slices (not pieces) and since my sister didn't want it to go with the chicken and waffles, I ended up giving it to my cousin who was taking home some leftovers. It was enough bacon to make a good size BLT or even two breakfast plates of eggs and bacon for the next day. The Blue Crab Cake Sandwich was really good....you could taste the crab! Sometimes I get weary to order crab cakes of any kind because it's a hit or miss menu item. I've had some that taste like a whole bunch of filler instead of crab. This one was good and the spicy aioli sauce used was really good.   My brother in law had some kind of burger that looked good! My nephew had a simple cheese quesadilla that came with orange slices. My other nephew had a small cheeseburger maybe off of a kid's menu. My cousin's wife had an egg and corned beef meal that was served in a skillet. I'm not sure what my cousin ordered, but I'm sure it was good and a big portion. He and his wife ordered some kind of banana pancakes for dessert...I was so full, but had a small piece just to try it...it was amazing!   It's funny because they're known for their large portions, and when I looked at our plates at the end, almost all of us wiped out our plates.  The food was really good that I still decided to give 5 stars after contemplating giving 4 stars due to poor service. It took a while to have someone take our order and the food took a while to come out. Also, I don't recall our waitress coming back to check if we needed refills or needed anything else; and the funny thing is that it was so slow that night. It was a Thursday night and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. Oh well! I think I will still come back.",

    "text": "Make sure you are hungry before you decide to come here. The portions are MASSIVE!  We stopped by for dinner while in the area and were surprised there was no wait. Thinking back it really is more of a breakfast/brunch place so it makes sense. We had our choice of seating on a Saturday night which is rare when we go out but it was nice as we were with friends so we could be loud and linger without bothering others.  Three of us ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles, there was also a fried chicken salad, grilled cheese and pancakes around the table. The star was the chicken and waffles which came out stacked high and smelling delicious. The waffles had bacon in them which in theory sounds good but I wasn't a big fan of there bacon. They were still tasty but there was just so much food on the plate I focused on the beautifully seasoned friend chicken. I took a bite of my sons grilled cheese and found it was nothing out of the ordinary. In the end I could barely finish half of my meal and I would do it all over again, we were also treated to red velvet waffles with ice cream for dessert to celebrate a couple birthdays. Unfortunately I was so full I could only manage a couple bites but it was yummy.  The service was fantastic at this location. Our server was awesome and incredibly fast and efficient. Prices were reasonable for the amount of food you get. Be careful when ordering drinks as not all beverages are free refills. We learned the lemonade was a $1.00 refill the hard way.  When back in the area we will be definitely visiting again for breakfast.",

He got to is right away and he was super inviting and accommodating to our needs. It was my first time here because I wanted to have the authentic taste of chicken & waffles. Must I say my exceptions were met! Holy Snapple, it's was HUGE but oh so delicious! My cousin and I had to share the plate. I don't know if I'll ever taste chicken & waffles that good here in NorCal. I also had the Spiked Watermelon Lemonade with their take home glass, that drink was the best! So delicious as the right amount of alcohol for brunch time. I'm totally craving it now that I'm writing this lol they have his cucumber ranch that is to die for! VERY light and fresh!   Their bathrooms are also well kept clean!",

It wasn't busy but she was busy since it appeared she was the only server on the floor. And still 5 star service.  Food- delicious....and nothing short of humongous. We got the Famous Andy's sage chicken benedict, the #5 burger, and the chicken fried steak. You can literally eat the freshly made strawberry jam for dessert. It is that perfectly sweetened.  Thanks Megan for the great service and delicious food.",

They where not taking reservations so we showed up about 45 minutes before we really wanted to eat and we where just about right it took about 40 mins to get seated.  So far so good staff was very friendly..        After being seated our waitress came and go our drink order and asked if we had any questions? She promptly returned with our drinks and asked if we where ready to place our order.This is where it all goes down hill.      My daughter asked about a sauce that came on a sandwich she was thinking of getting. The waitress said should would bring her a taste of it so she could decide and took the rest of our orders..  Well the taste never came, our orders came out at different times with the explanation from a manager who was dropping the food off that they do not have a hot plate so as it gets done they bring it out right away. Ok  I can deal with that hot food is a plus. My daughter never confirming that was the sandwich she wanted , got that sandwich. We asked for extra napkins 3 times which never came. My son wanted a different dressing and some BBQ sauce, which we had to ask for 3 or 4 times which finally arrived as he was almost finished. Never got drink refills till the very end after we asked another server.         The food was amazing but the service was horrible at best. She seemed to just not retain anything after you asked for it..     I'll go back but not likely to this location...",

The steak was real tenderized round steak, but it was deep fried with the coating hard and burned. The green beans were shriveled and dry, obviously not fresh but reheated from the night before. The biscuit was OK, but no butter and the little cup of marmalade had a dry skin over it, having been left uncovered in a cooler for who knows how long. The ice tea was OK, but nothing to write home about. On second visit I had the breakfast platter special du jour. Again, the ice tea was OK. But the skillet meal looked like something that had been made up of whatever would soon be by its fresh due date. How can they get away with serving dry wrinkled chopped bell peppers? It's a mystery.  Both visits cost slightly more than $20 with tip. Not worth it.  Not a fan.",

We were quoted a 30min wait for a party of 9 and after waiting for an hour we were told the party of 10 that came after us was seated first since they had a larger party.  Waiting area inside is tiny and no covered waiting outside.  Finally seated us.  Tables are small, chairs uncomfortable, music so loud the waiters couldn't hear the orders.    The food as always was fabulous, but my husband didn't get his chorizo hash till everyone else was almost done- we had to waive down help for 15min prior to getting anyone to notice he didn't get his food.  No one offered drink refills.    We called the manager over and instead of being helpful she argued with us about the meal .    May see about getting their great food to go next time and eating in the comfort of home.",

About the food? Overpriced and very average. Meh. not a fan. Service? had to wait 30 minutes for water. almost left before order came out. too bad. I had high hopes. We did ask the server to lower it and got an attitude while she took her sweet time adjusting it only a tad.  since it was hard for her to walk in and out we endured the pain of poor service in silence.  couldn't wait to leave.

However about a month ago, I went in with some friends and got a formerly favorite of mine but it was severely undercooked.  As many awesome experiences as I've had with this place, the one bad one has me second guessing ever coming back.    I ordered the chicken pot pie which is always amazing.  The ingredients are usually prepared to perfection, from the bowl to the veggies, to the chicken, and the sauce.  (I also love the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which I've ordered many times here and has always been awesome.)  This time the chicken was severely undercooked.  It was slimy and almost raw.  The veggies were also undercooked, but it didn't matter as my dinner was done after a few bites of the chicken.  I brought most of it home, intending to cook it later.  After two weeks of staring at it in the fridge and almost losing my lunch each time, I can say it was an effective weight loss tool, so there's that.    I've been to most of the other locations in Vegas, and I'll be going to the one on Sahara in the future.  I will not likely be back to this one despite many good experiences. I'm also struggling to ever order the chicken pot pie at any of the locations after this experience.  It is a shame because when done correctly, it is an amazing dish, one of their best.",

The server was apologetic, but it wasn't busy. There were only a couple tables filled on our side. It was a bit more than an hour to closing.  Noticed it was a trend when servers constantly had to get the hostesses attention to seat people. The table near us got their food and was missing an order. Manager came over and comped their late chicken and waffles. The customer commented to the table that it was way too drenched in syrup but at least they didn't have to pay.   The smores mocha was melted marshmallow goodness. The coffee was really strong. Dad ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. It looked soft and moist, not dry and overlooked. He's picky but actually loved it. Brother ordered the crab cake Benedict. It was huge. Crab cakes were delicious and so much better with the sauce. Mashed potatoes and biscuit were heavy and dense, so he ended up leaving half. The crab cake sandwich was good. The crab cake is flaky and delicious.  We'll still be back to try some pancakes and hope service is better next time.",

    "text": "I came in to Hash House A Go Go for a late breakfast/early lunch. I ordered a mushroom swiss buger because, well, mushrooms. Rather than fries I ordered my burger with a side salad.   I wanted Italian dressing which they do not have at Hash House. The server told me the salad comes with cucumber ranch or I could choose one of their other dressings. He listed regular ranch and a vinaigrette and a couple of others I can't remember. I chose the cucumber ranch. I probably should have gone with the vinaigrette. The cucumber ranch sounds refreshing but I really couldn't taste much. The salad had potential with the romaine, green onion and radishes. But the lack of flavor in the dressing and the strange chewy croutons (cornbread?) were a turnoff.  The burger itself was good. The meat reminded me of the camp steaks my mom used to cook when I was a kid. Not sure of that is a good thing but it was familiar. It was a big burger for sure. I actually had a hard time finishing it and I am traditionally a big eater. The burgers here are \"stuffed.\" Really it was like having two patties with mushrooms and cheese in between. Then there were the standard burger toppings of lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles. The big a$$ knife stuck through the middle to keep the burger together was a bit much. I suppose it was meant to be used to cut the burger in half but I don't roll that way. To me, a simple wooden skewer would have sufficed. I also didn't appreciate the giant spring of fresh rosemary stuck in the top bun. I like rosemary as an herb to flavor foods while cooking but used only sparingly. I am of the school of thought that garnishes should be edible. A woody stem of rosemary is not. On the subject of strange garnishes are the twiggy thinks strewn about my plate. It looked like sticks of burnt uncooked spaghetti. What was that all about? If it doesn't serve a purpose, leave it off my plate, thank you.  Hash House A Go Go is a popular place. They have many locations nationwide that all seem to be busy so they must be doing something right in some peoples eyes. For me, it seems over rated and over priced. Yes, you get a lot of food so the prices are probably fair based on portion size. But if you aren't entirely happy with the food, bigger isn't necessarily better. I enjoy the country atmosphere but the industrial metal chairs are terribly uncomfortable. For those of us who are a little wide side-to-side, the back of the chairs wraps around and digs into the waist and hips. I wasn't really able to sit all the way back so sat forward which led to slipping off a bit. One would think that a place that boasts larger portions would have larger patrons. Appropriate seating would be appreciated. Please take no offense to that statement as it is not meant to be disparaging. Just an honest thought I had while squirming and waiting for my meal. Having now tried Hash House, the curiosity is satisfied and the desire is gone. Will I come back? Perhaps. But it will likely be a while.",

It felt comfy.The menu was unique, prices average to me, so after looking the menu over for a bit, I decided on the Tractor Driver combo with the Vanilla waffle,two eggs, and crispy potatoes. James chose the ham,spinach and cheddar Farm Scramble. (Note: he said he wasn't impressed with the place, food or prices.)Even though it took a bit of time before our food came, when it did it looked pretty on the plate. My vanilla waffles were delish, the crispy potatoes weren't as crispy as I'd have liked them and lacked flavor, the eggs were over cooked, if I decide to come here again I'd skip the eggs for sure and try a different side, even though I didn't eat everything just half the waffles and a few bites of the rest it filled my tummy up! Over all...I give this place 3 stars and the fourth star is because of our server Yvette she was on point with her service. She's a great asset to this place.

This would be a good option for a group that has a variety of tastes. They also have a pretty large drink menu. Last time I was here I had the griddled french toast with eggs and mashed potatoes. The french toast was good and I liked the griddled banana on top. The eggs were cooked over easy as requested, but the mashed potatoes were bland. As with all of their dishes it was way too much food. My husband had the biscuits with gravy and that was actually pretty tasty.

    "text": "So first thing wrong here is I ordered corned beef hash. I don't consider it a long stretch of the imagination that ordering corned beef hash from a restaurant named \"hash house a go go\" would yield anything but a  delicious breakfast of said choice. I was wrong. If you want traditional corned beef hash, don't order it here. It's just pulled corned beef with random diced vegetables in it. NOTE TO CHEFS: THAT'S NOT CORNED BEEF HASH. From someone who has eaten a ton of corned beef hash for breakfast in my days at diners, delis, and golf courses all over the US, this was a huge disappointment.   We also ordered the crab cake benedict. While the crab cake was good, we didn't care too much for the spicy hollandaise sauce it came with. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, because when a restaurant carries a specialty item that deviates from the norm, they usually carry a regular alternative. But not here. They didn't have regular hollandaise for the eggs benedict. Weird, right? But it gets weirder. I order a side of ranch for my crispy potatoes. This was my answer: \"We only carry cucumber ranch dressing. Is that okay?\" Again, a normal item ruined by some inane need to make things \"fancy\" when they shouldn't be. (On top of just the fact that they put friekin' cucumbers in ranch dressing. Seriously?!)  Which leads to my final points: if you're going to charge fancy prices for fancy food, first of all don't bill yourself as a homestyle restaurant. Nothing was homestyle about this place aside from the large portions. And secondly, if you're going to charge fancy prices, make sure you have the quality and the taste to back it up. The food here is nothing special. It's kind of like that deal you get in the mail regarding the 60\" LED LCD TV on sale for $99 dollars: it's too good to be True.   Would I recommend this place to others? Yes, if I don't like them and want them to have an overpriced breakfast that doesn't taste all that special for the fare.   Would I come back here again? I wouldn't bet on it.",

    "text": "We visited Hash House on Sunday 3/22/15 and were quoted a 35 minute wait.  We were seated after waiting over 75 minutes.  I don't think their method of calculating wait times is very scientific.  After being seated, our waitress came over approximately 10 minutes later and we ordered our drinks and food at the same time.  It took another 25 minutes to get our food (and to see a wait staff person again to request a drink refill).  Hopefully they are just working out the new business kinks and the service gets better.  On to the food...we ordered the Artichoke, Sundried Tomato, and Fresh Spinach Hash with scrambled eggs, fruit, and a biscuit and the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower drizzled with hot maple reduction and fried leeks.  The portions on both meals was over the top and we took home more than we ate!  But, the everything was hot, fresh, and very good. However, the two hours we spent waiting for it colored our experience.",

I've driven past this place on a weekend many times and the lines are always out the door, so I waited until I could go on a weekday. There was no line and service was super quick.   We ordered the chicken and waffles and the sundried tomato, basil and goat cheese farm scramble. The chicken and waffles was beautifully presented, but the taste was just mediocre. I've had much better fried chicken, and in fact it wasn't all that crispy. Some parts were even a little soggy. Pretty disappointed. The waffles were pretty good though and I really liked the bacon strips inside. The farm scramble was good, but nothing I couldn't make myself. The potatoes that came on the side were nice and crispy and had good flavor.   All in all, the food was just okay and it's kind of pricey for breakfast food. Probably won't be back.",

Every element of that dish was flavorful, hearty and decadent: the biscuits, the eggs (tip: switch out scrambled for over easy), amazing chipotle cream, crispy bacon, and of course the fried chicken (the meat itself was slightly dry but I guess that's how chicken breasts are). A tad salty but that's the nature of the dish. ($16.99) Definitely recommend!!!!  Service was excellent. She was attentive and friendly, and warned us of the portion sizes. We came on Friday lunchtime and it was about half full. Food came out quickly, but not too quickly. Easy parking as this location isn't the main one.",

Also, when mayonnaise was requested, we were given two of the \"to go\" mayonnaise packets from behind the bar.

The waitress was so nice and got us seated right away.  I ordered the chicken Benedict and my friends got the blueberry pancake, and red velvet pancake with eggs, bacon. potatoes.  The both raved how good the red velvet pancake was and ordered extra frosting.  I loved the chicken Benedict.  I could have eaten on it for 3 days it was so big!  The service was great and our waitress really friendly.  My friend also got some coffee drink with whip cream on it.  She loved it.  I will defiantly be back next time I am in Vegas.   So glad this location is here so I don't have to fight the long lines on the Vegas Strip.",

We came here for brunch on Wednesday and ordered 4 main dishes to split and boy was it more than enough food for the 5 of us. We ordered the French toast, fried chicken Benedict, sun-dried tomato, basil and goat cheese scramble and the corned beef hash. Everything was amazing, the fried chicken Benedict being my favorite dish of them all and the scramble being the one I would pass on next time. The French toast to me was too soft and soaked in the egg batter just a little too long but my sisters seemed to love it. The service was also amazing and everything came out in such a timely manner. Our waitress was super attentive and made us feel right at home. I can't wait til I can come back on my next trip!",

When I was ultimately Checked on the server asked if I wanted something else.  Due to time I said no.  She said she was going to speak with manager.  She came back with tab and $4.99 was deducted from my total for the partially eaten meal.  Seemed crazy to me but I was not going to create a issue.  Seemed odd the manager did not take time to come see me.  And odd to deduct such a small amount for basically a uneaten meal.   I have no plans to ever go here again based on this experience.",

    "text": "After seeing Hash House a Go Go featured on Travel Channel's Food Paradise and Man v. Food, I've wanted to check it out when I'm in Vegas.  The day finally came during my last trip to Sin City. Though there are four locations in Vegas, we stopped by this location since we were in the area.  The restaurant is a standalone location in a large shopping mall.  Arriving around 12:30pm, we were seated without wait. As we perused the menu, our waitress came and greeted us.  She asked if this was our first visit and after we said yes, she talked about their food, the large portions and gave us some of her recommendations.    Our order: Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles - the entree has two sage fried chicken breasts piled on top to four waffles with a slice of smoked bacon baked into it and topped with a hot syrup reduction and fried leeks. The whole tower has a large knife holding it together.  The chicken was moist and nicely seasoned. Ingenious to have a strip of bacon baked into each thick waffle. Delicious and yes, a huge portion.  Famous Twisted Flapjacks with Blueberries and Lemon Curd - Al Roker says they're bigger than your head!  The pancake was fluffy and had a generous amount of blueberries in it.  By mixing a little lemon curd with the maple syrup, it gave it a nice sweetness with a hint of tartness.   Glad I was able to finally try the sage fried chicken and waffles.  It is one of the best chicken and waffles that I've tried.  Our waitress was friendly and I will be back in the future to try her favorite, Hash House fried chicken benedict.",

First, the entire service was slow,  and it wasn't busy - 11:30am.  Waitress never checked on us except when delivering food.  We started off with fried pickles - four slices of pickles with pablo coating $5.  That was $1.25 per slice and they weren't that good.  My wife had a strawberry lemonade  - it was warm.  Had to stir it for a few minutes to melt the ice to cool it down.  Not a good start.  We then had their famous chicken and waffles.  They were really good - chicken is a hit.  I wasn't a fan of the full, thick slice of bacon in the waffle.  I would have preferred the bacon be crumbled up so I could get the flavor in each bite.  The flavors were good and I can see why it is their most popular item.  The portions are HUGE.  My wife and I split the plate and it filled me up.  I am a big eater.  I will probably return, but it just didn't live up to the hype.  Sorry. :(",

My scramble eggs  came with salmon, Brie cheese, tomato and fresh basil on the top. The potato were well seasoned, the biscuit could use some improvement it was fairly dry and not flaky! Also I ordered a cappuccino which actually came out like a double macchiato.  My husband loved his dish too, I tried some of the meat and it was absolutely delicious.  Service was great and professional, the general atmosphere was nice too.  I will definitely look forwards to try more of their menu.",

When the server came back he mumbled something, I asked him to repeat it and still had no idea what he said so I ordered a diet Pepsi.  My husband was looking at the beer and was considering which he wanted to order, but he was never given the chance to order.  Even asked if he could order a beverage and the server walked away.  So our food came and we had no utensils.  And no one in sight was going to give us any so my husband went to work and found forks for us to eat with.  Seriously?  This is a service town.  HH has been one of my favorite places for the 10 yrs that I have lived here.  I guess the Sahara location is the only one that is worth going to.

When they finally figured that out, they took our order down and took them more than 40 minutes to even bring out our salad. Our burgers and fries were cold! And I forgot to mention they didn't even have their dough ready for their famous chicken pot pie. Horrible! Get it together!",

First of all,i get there with my 2 kids and ask for a table for 5 (i was waiting for my friend and her daughter to get there) the table becomes available but then they tell us they can't seat us til the whole party gets there. WHAT? !!! That's not how other restaurants do it. They normally will seat you even if the rest of your party isn't there yet. What's the deal with that? Then i order the bacon waffle and for as big as the waffle is, there's only 2 slices of bacon in it and to be honest, there's really nothing special about it. I do wanna go back and try other things on the menu, i hope those are better. And they really should change their policy about not seating people until their whole party gets there. If there is a reason for that then please enlighten me.",

The waiter didn't know the specials and the menu was very small nothing like the other locations and the waiter said the reason was because the kitchen couldn't get it right so they are going to offer that for now. So we sat and waited after a while we decided just to leave. Very disappointing never got our drinks and didn't get to order food.",

Long story short, good food. Nice atmosphere. Clean. Nice wait staff. I liked this place a lot! Reason being that I did not give it 5 stars is because I feel that there wasn't anything incredibly special about it except for the big portions. It was good food...but did not stand out to me in taste. I would love to come back for breakfast sometime and see how that compares.",

    "text": "If I could give zero stars, I would! It started out with us walking in. The restaurant looked pretty empty so we thought we would be seated at a reasonable time. Nope! It still took almost 10 minutes. Once we were sat, it took another 10 minutes for a server to finally arrive to our table to say, \"I'll be with you in a moment\". That moment was another 5 minutes. She finally came back, we gave her our drink order and our kids' food order. We ordered the kid's hamburger, the kid's chicken tenders with ranch, the meatloaf skillet and the pancake. I also ordered the hot chocolate. She took our order and I didn't see her again for awhile. A food runner brought out our food. My youngest had the chicken fingers and he didn't get his ranch with his food. He won't eat it until he has the ranch with his meal. Unfortunately, by the time we got his ranch, his food was already cold. My husband's potatoes on his dish were cold and underdone. My pancake had a horrible aftertaste. It also tasted like they didn't clean the flat top because it also had an odd savory taste. I took 3 bites and could no longer stomach it. I couldn't touch my hot chocolate either because nowhere on the the menu did it mention they were going to drench it in cinnamon. I didn't even taste it because I absolutely hate cinnamon. My husband ended up trying it and said that it just tasted like cinnamon water with a hint of chocolate. Only 1/4 of the food was eaten. The server obviously didn't care that we hardly touched our food. The next time I saw her, instead of asking how everything tasted or if there was anything wrong with the dish (since I clearly didn't touch it in awhile), she asked if we wanted boxes. At that point, I was livid. We ended up just asking for the check because I was disappointed and angry. It took another 5 minutes for her to grab the check! We left there with a tab that was over $50 for food that was hardly touched because it was inedible and no service. To top it all off, we left there hungry! Apparently, I paid this place money to leave hungry, which makes me even angrier! So disappointed! Thanks hash house! I now have to go to another restaurant and pay another establishment after leaving and paying your establishment to eat some edible food since you miserably failed to provide any service or food that we could eat.",

    "text": "Sad to say... That night that you go out for your cheat meal and it wasn't worth the cheat. I was so looking forward to this date night with the fiance, celebration and a cheat meal, what can better? But unfortunately the dish I ordered was terrible and cheap tasting.... I could have gone to macaroni grill or out back, but I thought we should splurge and eat some amazing food, food that should have stood out from the rest. But I was sorely disappointed and wish I had choose some where else. The waitress was friendly and the service was fast but I recommend that you stay away from the smoked salmon pasta salad that advertises sun dried tomatoes, smoked salmon, spinach, pesto and bacon. Sounds delicious , but it wasn't! The salmon, pesto and sun dried tomatoes where no where to be found and I could have made it better myself.  If only I had read the reviews before I ate there... I had high hopes for this chain in Henderson, because driving across town for the other locations was always a hassle, but if they keep this up, this restaurant will be closed in no time. #canigetmymoneyback #hashhouseagogo #$72",

From the attire and looks of boredom on the hostess staff, to the blatantly empty tables - hash house wants you to know they are a different kind of restaurant.   (Side note - I work in a restaurant and understand that sometimes certain tables cannot be sat. It is brunch at a brunch restaurant - seat all the tables or put a \"reserved\" sign on the table. Period. )  We are seated in the time we were quoted (15-20 minutes) and waited about 4 minutes to be greeted. Our greeting was bizarre since the server was just \"helping out\" our actual server. She was all over the place and couldn't even make eye contact. Our bloody Mary's took a while and were mediocre. Our food took a very long time (we were not alone in this as several tables around us seemed agitated by the amount of time the food took) and our server came back only after a manager had stopped by to check on us. We were abruptly given a check while still eating and when I asked for a refill on my soda, was given a mountain of ice. Overall, not a great experience and we will not be returning.   Food - 4 stars; corned beef hash was delicious, but not what you may expect. Chicken and waffles: beware, the chicken is bone-in, but delicious. Waffles were dry. Fried leeks were a great touch.   Service - 2 stars; if you want a bizarre experience and have your schedule clear...this may be your spot...",

Appetizer and the Huge, yummy burgers!   However, this time, we brought our kids with us as we were celebrating a special family event and the events of the evening (Service & food) absolutely tainted the rest of the night and the mood of our celebration!  We ordered the yummy Bacon appetizer that we'd been telling the kids about and when it arrived- it was cold, floppy bacon covered in congealed grease! The smell alone was off putting and we were dumb founded! We sent it back and our nice waitress was horrified that the busboy, brought this \"Unacceptable\" product out!  When she returned with it she told us that they put it on the grill - UH, not even my kids would eat it! Sent it back-and moved on with the meal- still trying to keep our smiling celebrating faces as others who arrived well after us- were getting their meals- (So, no appetizer, no meal) Finally, the food arrived, the kids food was delicious  Pancake and bacon waffle (yay- that bacon DID taste good!) We had mentioned that my hubby and I were just splitting the burger because they are enormous - but it was brought out on a single plate (not a big deal, but the nights errors were starting to add up) the busboy brought us a plate and he just sort of flung it in my general direction-(still trying to be polite and smile) I ask for some mayo from our waitress- by the time our waitress came back to see if the busboy brought it - I had already finished my half!  With all this  happening, I was no longer happy, but the kids were happy so we were going with it- as we were wrapping up the we asked the waitress for a \"to go\" box for my daughter's pancake remains and we waited for 17 minutes for her to come back to our table and by time she returned, she had forgotten that we ever asked for it- (seriously, it was 15 feet from our table!) My mood ruined, feeling frustrated and incredibly disappointed in this experience- we get ready to pay, now, here's the thing- as parents of twins a night out a huge deal for us, so we pick our places carefully- I am very sad that this happened, but more needed to be done to recognize that we were the Murphy's LAW table.    Although, thoroughly disappointed in the experience we still left a nice tip because we understand how the food service world is, however, I am so saddened that it had to be on a night that was so special and we left deflated. So, it seems that consistency was the issue- why was the first time so wonderful and this time terrible? I've no idea, but we will not return to find out! :(",

For being a Saturday morning, we were actually seated quite quickly. We looked at the menu while we were waiting so we were ready to order as soon as we were seated. Our server promptly took our order and made some helpful suggestions for things to order. The portions are HUGE so my parents and I shared a hash and flapjacks which was enough for all of us. I wasn't particularly impressed by the food. The hash eggs were a little over-cooked and the flapjacks had a rubbery texture. We also had a side of chicken sausage which was probably the best item. Overall, a decent brunch restaurant.",

    "text": "This place is very yummy. My first encounter with a hash house was in Hillcrest, CA. I've had a fair share of taste with the menu but the one thing that has stuck out was the Andy's Sage fried chicken benedict. The portion is huge, my boyfriend and I always share and he eats like a monster. The bottom layer is a large biscuit, tomato, spinach, chipotle sauce, TENDER fried chicken, bacon, mozzarella and scrambled eggs BUT we get our eggs over medium. I love breaking the yolk over everything and eating it together. By far, in my opinion the best thing on the menu. I love a hearty breakfast and this place hits the spot when I want to leave full and satisfied. On weekends plan on waiting a long time though, this place is a trendy breakfast spot on the weekend so it does get busy.",

It is so refreshing and delicious. We decided to share two plates. We got the #5 hamburger with the bacon, avo, and cheddar cheese. Amazing! We also got the bbq chicken sandwich. That was very tender and juicy. Great if you want something a little healthier. We will definitely come back!",

The pumpkin mash is mixed with old fashion spuds and is well flavored and not overly pumpkin.   2.Marshmallow Cafe Moca- This may be closing into a new addiction. Blow torches melt down the marshmallows creating a soft shell over the Mocha. Chocolate powder and sauce is liberally drizzled over the cup adding flavor and flair.   3. Fried Green Tomato Stacks-A good solid choice. Not too crispy and not soggy.   My party was too full for dessert. I fully intend on returning to try them, if not just for the Marshmallow Moca again.   On a final request to the house:  Stock Ginger Beer mainly for Moscow Mules!",

If you don't know about this place, they're located on 555 North Stephanie St. Henderson. We didn't really have to wait too long, we went around 10a with no reservation. As for parking, there's plenty of it being that it's in a shopping center. They're open from 7-9ish I believe but close on Mondays.   The staff is really nice and our waiter explained the menu being that we're new comers. They're known for their chicken! It was on Man vs. Food and that's what we went with. I ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken ($13.79) and it was Ono (Great)! The chicken was nice and juicy and the sauce was really good too. I recommend Andy's Chicken.   I do have to let you know that the portion size is huge. I did not finish and you can easily split the meals there. They do give military discount (25%) so make sure you ask. The restaurant is nice too. It's clean and has a little rustic feel to it.   If you're ever in the area, I recommend checking this place out.",

Everyone was wearing very cute sweaters and most seemed to be OK with working on the holiday. Our server was very happy and patient. We have only eaten at this chain maybe a few times, so neither of us thought we got what we ordered (I really think it would be great to have a picture menu!) My husband wanted a Benedict and by no definition did he receive one . It was simply a pile of food that somewhat contained what the menu said, and he was disappointed. He has lost a lot of weight over the last few years and his plate was covered with biscuits and potatoes, so he ate the chicken and eggs and put the rest in a to-go container. Oh well. I thought I was ordering something with a smoked salmon but got a odd cooked scramble that I ate, but would have never ordered again. In our opinion cooked salmon and eggs don't compliment each other well. Needless to say, I too had to box most of what I got.  He did enjoy his nitro coffee, the jelly on my plate (peach) and one waiters Darth Vader sweater. lol  We will return, happily. We will just try to order better next time! You are still a chain that I love and wish would appear in my hometown!",

The price for just a single pancake ($7.99) is outrageous  3. The food is never hot 4. The coffee is always closed  5. The only free refillable drink here is water  Overall,  my brother enjoys this place but I can definitely miss this.",

This location is definitely the non-busy one. You don't have to wait forever on a weekend morning.  Now the food, I have tried many of their dishes and my favorite is their legendary chicken and waffles. The other items, it was a \"nope not again\" deal. Not a big fan of their sundried tomato and feta scramble or their smoked salmon dishes. The chicken and waffles are pretty bomb though. The meatloaf is good and anything with syrup is nice as well. I have brought many guests to HH and it's always a win for out of towners.   The servings are huge, so more than likely you will have take away.",

Bacon strips are intertwined with the batter to make an incredible waffle. It came with scrambled eggs. The food was on par and the server was friendly, polite, patient, and accomodating. The other destination was another of our sunday morning breakfast joints ( The Coffee Cup in Boulder City ) but in the end Hash House won the unanimous decision.",

The food is still delicious and make sure your appetite didn't go on vacation before you come here. In fact, do a two mile (or more) charity walk like we did before you dine.  Our party of four arrived around 10:40 on a late Saturday morning to a restaurant at capacity and on a wait, we were seated before 10:45, and we were walking out the door at 11:25. We sat in a booth in the bar area and Yvette took great care of us. Although she was busy, she was quite pleasant, informative, and efficient. From our experience on this visit, we did not have any service issues that have been described about the restaurant in its opening months.  I had the gigantic pumpkin flapjack which was light, fluffy, and the pumpkin flavor was tasty but not overpowering. This was a good start to many other pumpkin flavors I'll be experiencing this fall. Also ordered were the barbecue chicken sandwich with fries, the Warsaw hash, and the basic. Everyone was hungry and finished within 15 minutes with every single plate being clean. We cashed out and left happy, full, and satisfied knowing that we didn't spend the majority of our morning hungry and waiting.  The restaurant still kind of reminded me of the Tony Roma's that was there previously, but there is plenty of seating and if the service is capable, should be able to handle large volume of customers. Although pretty classic comfort/farm food, the extra \"twists\" and large portions makes this place unique and will have us coming back for more.",

There were only a handful of customers already seated, but the server was slow.  When we finally saw her, she stopped to let us know she knew we were there, but then we did not see her again for (we timed) seven minutes for her even see if we wanted coffee, which ideally she would have asked the first time she stopped, so I subtracted a star (minus only half star if option) for the initially slow service.  When we finally received our coffee, it was fresh and flavorful.  My husband enjoyed a vanilla waffle which he said, was the best waffle ever and he consumed all of his breakfast, which included eggs and hashbrown.  I enjoyed an excellent potato, cheese, onion, bacon and avocado hash that included sides of fresh fruit and a biscuit with leftovers for 2 more breakfasts!  The price exceeded $30 for two breakfasts, but factoring in the leftovers (two more breakfasts) making it technically four breakfasts, it was great value and great food.",

The exterior of the restaurant is nice and there is ample parking... but unfortunately that is where my great experience ends.  Our waitress was ok.  It took her a while to come over to us, which was shocking because the place was a ghost town.  We sat for about 10 minutes waiting for someone to even acknowledge us after the hostess sat us.   There were a few wait staff walking around the place and we were promptly ignored by all of them.  there were people seated in our section and they were acknowledged, but not us?  Weird.  So lets get to the good.  I ordered a blueberry flapjack which was tasty and freshly prepared.  Unfortunately the corn beef hash that my fiance ordered for us to split came out on a cast iron skillet and it was COLD.  here is the deal:  either this was not freshly prepared or it was not heated to proper temperature before serving it to us.  we waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged and waited like 6 minutes for the food to come out.  It was shockingly fast actually.  But not in a good way.  We also asked for the biscuit on the side because my fiance cant have glutenous biscuits, but that was ignored as well.  I did not complain at the restaurant nor did we request to send it back to be heated because we all know what happens when you send food back.  They get one star for the facade and parking, and nothing else.  I am done with you Hash House for you are a has been... I guess its better to be a has been, than a never was.  get back to your roots and forget about crazy expansion, or you will lose your fan base that made you so popular to begin with.",

I had one of the hamburgers and couldn't even find any room for even 1 french fry.  Our server was a delight and yes there were some problems with service but staff are trying to coordinate meals, serving and kitchen.  If you go during the first week you have to remember that the staff are learning the timing along with the cooks.  It takes more then a day or two for the pace to get set.  We waited a bit longer then expected because they ran out of french fries.  However, it was worth watching other dishes coming by, other patrons reactions when their order was delivered and the smiles on everyone's faces as they ate.  Try it another time if your experience this opening week did not meet your needs, it is a wonderful place.",

I was told by the server that the chef would not substitute the cheese but he would give the piece of cold cheddar cheese on the side if I wish. I was in shock. The aggressive manager came over and said that they don't have microwaves or any way to put the cheddar on the portobello and that was why they can't do it. I asked how they put the goat cheese that normally comes on it, on the sandwich? She said that they used the griddle. I said can you please use cheddar on the griddle rather goat cheese.  She said she couldn't do it!  We obviously left. I was floored about this experience. I then remembered going to the one across town when they first opened and tried to order the same thing, the same way and was denied on the basis that they can't because their menu is made the way it is.  Omg  Avoid this place like a plague I look for good  customer service not dictatorship run restaurants",

We had 3 of the 4 people in our party present but they would not seat us until the fourth person arrived.  Total wait time was 75 minutes.  They could have seated us and at least we could have had coffee.  I had a 68 year old with us and no courtesy at all was given to her.  What if that fourth person changed their mind.  we would have been waiting for absolutely nothing.   The food was cold and should have been sizzling for the dish I ordered which was brought on a skillet.  The waitress was great though. The hostess and manager were totally rude and unprofessional.  I was reading the menu while I was waiting and tapped the hostess on the back of her shoulder to get her attention.  She rudely turned around and snarled at me.  She then told her manager about being hit by myself.  The manger then comes over and say,\" next time, don't hit our worker.\"  Totally unprofessional.  If I socked her in her eye, that would be considered hitting.   The portions were very large which was good.  The taste and quality of the food was not too good.  Egg works on Eastern is far better for cheaper pricing without the 75 minute wait and piss poor attitude hostesses who had attitude problems. No one were smiling and the mood was just herding you through, clean the table, and sit another un happy customer down. We will never come back here again and we will pass this information onto all our friends to NOT waste their time and money here.",

    "text": "So I was excited about finally getting to try this place since I had heard many things from people over the years but didn't have one close by.  We went relatively late at night with me, my wife, and kid.  First impression was the place looked nice.  The building used to be a Tony Romas and looks basically the same as Tony Romas used to look inside.  The service was very slow, it took a while to get orders and a very long time to get food.  The hamburger I ordered was very good, but I was severely disappointed in how small it was.  Way overpriced for the size of the burger.  The fries I had on the side were very good; however the place does not have RANCH.  So for my kid this was a killer issue since he pretty much has to have ranch for his chicken fingers, but in general who the heck doesn't have regular ranch?  Ok, they have some form of RANCH, I think it was like a cucumber ranch or something like that, I tried it and it was NOT good.  I don't want to be caught up on one simple thing, but really I just cannot believe a place like this does not serve regular ranch, that just blows my mind.  The wife said her food was pretty good, and her portions looked bigger than what I got, but still service was slow and too expensive for what we got.  I sort of want to come back and try something else, but not sure that I will considering this experience just wasn't good enough.",

When we heard it closed we were bummed but then really looked forward to this location opening. The food was below sub-par, very low quality ingredients, bland, and just was overall poorly executed. The worst part was having myself and 2 others all order different meals and we all came home and had to run to the bathroom with extreme bowel issues and nausea all evening from this place. STAY FAR AWAY. NEVER AGAIN!!",

I ordered an egg skillet - the cheese and other ingredients were not mixed thoroughly nor was it cooked completely. One bite would be all cheese, the next raw onion. It had avocado which was also raw. The crispy potatoes were crispy - but also dry and they had no seasoning. The biscuit was okay until I got to the middle where the sprig of rosemary had been stuck inside, and then all I could taste was rosemary. My husband ordered his eggs over medium and they were barely over easy. I was thinking of complaining but couldn't find the waitress and was tired of waiting anyway. Also, there was a table with two women and a baby that left shortly after we arrived. The baby had made a huge mess on the floor, which was still there when we were leaving. Nobody bothered to come clean anything. We won't be back.",

The food was amazing as per usual, BUT The service was terrible! It looked like they only had one server covering six tables which is tough and I get it but you gotta keep your cool. The waitress comes up to us and asks us if we are ready to order and we we told her no since we were waiting for our third person to show up and she yells THANK GOD, and walks away to oversee her other tables. I'm like I get you're all by yourself and busy but lady keep your feelings to yourself and check it at the door. The entire experience was annoying she later on rushed us to get our orders and our third person showed up and was rushing her to get her order. To the point she drops off our food and not even 10 minutes later she drops off the check! We open to check out our total and put the check book down to continue eating, it felt like a minute later she comes to our table and opens our checkbook to see if we put our form of payment like I'm like excuse me ? And she just walks away. In the end I love the food which is why I'm giving this place 3 stars, but management really needs to evaluate how their servers act and retrain them on how to offer customer service.",

Corned beef sandwich was shredded beef they must use in corned beef hash. One side of the bread was toasted on grill the other side was not grilled & soggy. Scrambled Eggs and pancake were comical. The pancake was about 10 inches across and pretty much undercooked with scrambled eggs on side. Once again impressive looking but not good. What can I say? I've seen numerous write ups in the local magazines raving about the food. Maybe this is a franchise now and this franchisee is lost. Certainly can't recommend & certainly won't be back.Will be gone in 6 months if they don't wise up fast",

Our service was good, the waitress recommended her favorites and some took her advice and were happy with the food.  Prices were good for the amount of food you got.

    "text": "I went to the this location twice.  The first time was for breakfast.  The service wasnt really that good. Food wise...the portion size was huge.  I had the pancakes, with sausage, and eggs over medium.  The pancakes were ok, my sausage was a little pink inside, and my eggs were over easy (Yolk wasnt cooked much).  My boyfriend had the waffle and bacon extra crispy.  The waffle was good but the bacon was burnt.  My son had the mac n cheese.  That was actually really good.  I didnt really knock them this time because I know how it is when a business first opens.  The next time my boyfriend and I came was during dinner.  The store was slow, so we expected to get seated right away.  When we walked in, nobody greeted us., we were just waiting. When we were finally seated, it took forever to get out drinks, and even to order our food.  I ended up ordering the burger with fries.  The fries were good, but by burger was bland, i had to add salt and pepper to my burger and I used a lot of ketchup for more taste.  My boyfriend order the chicken an waffles.  When he got it we had to send it back because he was allergic to the garnishes they put all over the chicken.  When he sent it back he ask for just the chicken and waffles no garnish.  They redid his food and when we got it there was rosemary and leeks all over the plate and his food.  I was annoyed now.  He spent the rest of the time picking off the leeks.  Service this time was worse.  Our server was never really around.  We sat right next to the host stand, so we asked the host for everything.  We were very disappointed with our meal.  It was such a big waste of money.  We left a tip under 15 percent, and we always give at least between 15 to 20% tip.  This was just bad.  When we left we both agreed to never come back and we regret not giving the host a tip (he did more for us than our server did)",

I prefer to use the words \"TERRIFIC\" and \"FANATASTIC\" to describe both the food and the service.  I have been dining out since my infancy, and I can testify (under oath, if necessary) that I have NEVER, in 66+ years of living, ever tasted BETTER mashed potatoes, anywhere.  The word \"awesome\" is inadequate to describe the taste; you have to experience it on your own, and I really hope that you will.  My first-ever visit was on Friday, March 18, 2016, and I'm very sorry I didn't try them much sooner in my life.  I sampled the meal called, \"THE BASIC,\" with 2 over-easy eggs, wheat toast, bacon & the out-of-this-world mashed 'taters.   Everything was super-fine, and the price was certainly reasonable.  But what is gonna bring me back (frequently, I hope) is DEVON, the server.  Good food and low prices mean nothing if the service isn't noteworthy, and if DEVON is \"typical\" of the folks working there, you are in for a most memorable and enjoyable visit.",

I got the biscuits and gravy, my wife got the pancake. My meal was hot, gravy was tasty. Biscuits were a little hard. They needed the gravy. Potatoes were ok. The \"fresh fruit\" ended up swimming in gravy as well. .  The pancake was of course as big as the plate. It was so cold the butter would not melt. Large portions are one thing when you get a pancake that is over 15\" across I think a stack of smaller ones would have been warmer.  We have no desire to return. We tried it once.",

First time my wife got the chicken fried steak and ended up sending it back because there wasn't any taste and I mean it literally tastes like nothing. I had the go to dish, chicken and waffles which again was lacking flavor, The chicken was juicy and cooked well, but there just wasn't any taste.   The second time we went I got a burger because of the bad experience with the chicken and waffles. The burger was hard and over cooked.   I love Hash House and was very excited to see this location open so close to my house. Previously we always went to the one in the M Resort but it was closed so to have one open in Henderson was awesome. I just hope they can get it together because this location isn't on par with the other locations in Vegas.",

    "text": "I'm sad to say that I shared the same experience as most of these reviewers.  Having previously been to one of the other Hash House a Go Go's, we were ecstatic when we saw this was opening up near us.  My wife was seriously bouncing around the car.  She ranted and raved about the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade.  Finally, opening week came!  We were ready to go that Friday, though worried about getting a table considering how busy the other locations are.  We set out to grab dinner and found that the parking lot was mostly empty.  We actually both wondered aloud whether the place was even open.  We walked in and found a handful of booths occupied and lots of empty tables and booths.  With no one waiting ahead of us, we were told it was going to be a 10 minute wait.  It felt like a joke at that point, considering the place was mostly empty.  But sure enough, we twiddled our thumbs while the very unpleasant hostesses talked amongst themselves and we waited for the poor bus boy to clean off the table that we were being assigned to, despite the fact that 85% of the tables were already clean and unused.  I had looked up the menu ahead of time and was super excited.  The appetizers looked enticing and there were at least a couple of entrees calling to me.  Of course, when we got there, they only had one menu available.  No full complement of dinner entrees, no appetizers at all.  And the prices?   Well, good lord.  The lemonade that my wife had been raving about was priced as if it had alcohol in it - prohibitively expensive.  The entree prices aren't too bad once you realize that their serving size is massive.  My wife and I decided on the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles as our last resort, though it was not either of our first choice.  The food came out at exactly the 5 minute mark.  It was acceptable, as far as dinner goes.  Not outstanding, but not disgusting.  We didn't so much get the \"Sage\" part of the Sage Fried chicken and fried chicken is always going to be greasy.  But the waffles were great and the waitress (once we were finally able to flag her down) provided us with an extra two cups of the maple reduction (come on now, it's really just a fancy name for syrup).  The service really is bad.  I have never seen a more dour and frumpy lot of hostesses and servers.  The hostesses at the front didn't even crack a smile.  There was no greeting, nor a \"thanks, have a good night!\" when we left.  Our waitress disappeared for extended periods, despite the place still not being busy at all.  We caught a fleeting glimpse of a waiter who seemed to be congenial but he too vanished after checking on us once.  I'm optimistic that this place turns a corner once it's been open longer.  Management obviously knew what they were doing with the other locations, so there's still hope of a recovery.  A full menu, servers who don't provide you service begrudgingly and more reasonable drink prices would work wonders.",

Our server was really nice and helped us with our food selection, and made sure we were happy.  The Smores Mocha  was heaven, the Mango tea was perfect. The Snickers Flapjacks were to die for! Big O'crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin with sweet potato fries was very       good! enough for 3 people! The Hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar Burger was dynamite!  loved the Biscuit  with home made jam!

    "text": "Shout out to management and staff for the wonderful soft opening this weekend!  That's right folks, Hash House is officially opening up on Stephanie February 23rd! Traveling from all the way down from the strip to right here in Henderson. This location is located in the same plaza at Macaroni Grill, Ulta, Sprouts, Old Navy and Nordstrom Rack. (You get the picture)  The location is very nice and clean, which is to be expected, but is decorated and themed very nicely to go along with HH's vibe. I mean, there's a tractor for god sake!  Service was very efficient and friendly and our waiter was very attentive. The food was prepped and delivered in a timely manner and there are no heat lamps or waiting so things come out as soon as they are finished.   As a table we ordered different entrees including the famous Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles, Crispy Pork Tenderloin, a stuffed burger and one of the breakfast scrambles. Our first fried chicken entree was raw in the middle but we were brought another order very promptly and was corrected. The waffles were very crispy and the bacon inside the waffle was delightful!   Overall the food was good and found the quality to be better than the times I've tried it on the Strip. (Hopefully this quality stays consistent looking forward) We also tried the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade which was delicious and the presentation was super cute!  Our table also ordered the Snickers Bread Pudding, which was very very rich. I'm glad we only got one to share. :P  Cheers to another good addition to Henderson in the foodie circuit!",

I also read the Yelp reviews in regards to the food and it seem like a place to try. Needless to say, I was not really impressed. It was great that we didn't have to wait to be seated. The waitress that helped us was nice however she o lay checked on us maybe 2x and the food took a little long to arrive. The portions are what they say and is considered \"farm size\" portions, prices were a little on the higher side but I guess that's the norm.  My brother ordered the chicken and waffles which was pretty tasty. He enjoyed his good and had extra leftover to take home and I was also able to take a few bites .  I ordered the Salmon Benedict (their version of a Benedict) I was VERY DISAPPOINTED. I was so tempted to return my order and get something else but I felt a little bad and I didn't want cause a scene ESP since It was my fault I chose to order that. The portion was huge but only because they piled on the mash potatoes and the biscuits were about 2 inches thick and it was very dry even with the sauce over it. I was so excited because I have read that it was a delicious dish , full of flavor and loaded with salmon. I was so wrong .  Salmon Benedict : * VERY DRY * Lacked flavor  * All I tasted was mashed potatoes  * Hardly any to no pieces of Salmon  *biscuit was very think and dry *sauce tastes like cheese   I get it they just opened and need to perfect their recipe but I was sad I spent $40 on lunch for 2 people and only had water to drink and I didn't enjoy my food .   I may comeback to try something else but not anytime soon and maybe not this location.",

On the advice of someone who knows the menu, they suggested I try the smoked salmon benedict. It included a more than generous helping of mashed potatoes, several hot biscuits, smoked salmon that were covered in a fried egg with a spicy benedict sauce.  I tried the Kiwi Watermelon drink with a side of spike and ginormous slice of watermelon. It's served with vodka, but I'm not sure which brand. I should have asked my waiter.  The dessert I tried was the tasty chocolate waffles, scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and chocolate sauce were drizzled on top. This was also a dish recommended by someone who knows the menu.  The waffles were just right, not too crispy and not too soft. There was enough for three people and then some. Desserts at Hash House A Go Go are best shared.  The menu has been simplified at this location so some of the dinner items and or appetizers may not be available. They still have a large amount of food though and their portions are huge.  I'm excited to try this location again during normal business hours. I heard that they will be having a happy hour from 4-7pm daily.",

    "text": "Now I remember why I wasn't anxious to go back after we tried HHAGG 4+ years ago.  It seems they focus way too much on ridiculously HUGE portions instead of good tasting food. It's really a shame bc I can't even imagine all the food they waste.  Hubby & I went for breakfast this morning. Wasn't my choice but since they opened this location so close to us, hubby has really been wanting to go again.  He got the fried chicken Benedict & I ordered the Smoked Salmon hash. Out came hubby's dish looking like a platter of food that could easily feed a family of 5 in a 3rd world country for at least a week. Mine was pretty close to the same size which made me feel even worse sending it back bc I knew it would just be thrown away. I just couldn't though.. The salmon was sooo dry, the \"crispy potatoes\" were a pile of soft cubed potatoes under all the dry salmon & my eggs were cold. I just couldn't take more than a couple bites & I did something I've only done maybe 1 or 2 other times in my life. I sent it back & opted for the basic breakfast instead. Made the mistake of choosing the griddled mashed potatoes instead of the \"crispy potatoes\" again & it was just bad. The whole thing was bad. Cold eggs again, limp bacon & a somewhat smashed pile of mashed potatoes that I'm sure never touched a griddle.  Anyway, done with that place. My hubby really enjoyed his meal so he may go back sometime & take our kids but I'll be washing my hair or something.",

And pleaseeeee, pleaseeeee, just because the options are big it's not going to make up for nasty chow. So please be honest! Just saying",

Another addition in the growing list of Strip area franchises coming to sleepy 'ole Henderson! I was eager to check out the vibe at this location, having been to a few of the other HH locations in the Valley. Happy Hour (Hashy Hour?) consists of $3 drinks and $5 food items. No speciality cocktails are on the happy hour menu. Disappointment! But, it's every day from 4-7. Yay! I had the mac 'n cheese with bacon happy hour bowl. A solid, satisfying dish with lots of cheesy goodness, and green onions. Also a lot of grease at the bottom, but this is the Hash House.  Only a few souls were at the bar, which I thought was strange for opening day. It got busier around the time I left. The bar is nice, it's situated in a square with tables surrounding it. Happy hour is a good chance to try some different food items before committing to a giant entree portion.  Miller's Henderson Ale House, be warned....let the competition begin.",

When I received my food, it was a very thin slice of UNTRIMMED steak that is chicken fried. Not the typical and very disappointing, although the person that I was with said her meal was delicious. The bacon was barely cooked and definitely all fat, with thin lines of meat. The eggs were slightly overlooked, but maybe the best thing on my plate.   My advice don't ever order off menu or substitute.",

They keep an eye for that sweet spot when the bacon is just perfect.  Great Bloody Mary! The lemon chicken I heard was good. He wasn't giving out tastes, guess it was that good!

Founded in 2000 and since expanding from San Diego to several cities from Coast-to-Coast, Sin City actually boasting the most by a wide margin, Hash House A Go-Go suggests that its cuisine is similar to that which one might find in the Midwest by way of states like Indiana and having spent more than thirty years as a Buckeye those claims certainly seem to be valid as everything from Sage Fried Chicken to pounded Pork and Meatloaf Sandwiches are rib-sticking hearty and served in portions large enough for two.  Spacious in design with a central bar area serving Beer and Cocktails while the Detroit Lions kicked-off another Turkey Day loss, the decor best described as Barnyard-chic with an antique tractor out front and everything from Stalks of Wheat to tattooed farmers lining the walls, it was shortly after checking in with the hostess that guests were led to a sizable four-top on the left half of the restaurant, a server soon dropping off menus with a big smile before filling water and describing the daily specials.  Not a place known for subtlety, the festive mood stoked by holiday music overhead with patrons all talking loudly as large parties continued to file in as the morning went on, it was perhaps twenty minutes after placing an order that plates arrived to completely crowd the table, share plates and bowls both delivered beforehand and everyone ready to dig in after a Pumpkin Pancake was topped with 100% Maple Syrup brought from home, the hubcap-diameter disc nearly an inch thick but cooked through with bold Cinnamon notes and quite a bit of pureed Pumpkin folded into the Batter.  Tacking on sides of Crispy Potatoes and a Buttermilk Biscuit served with Housemade Strawberry Jam, the former decent but a bit overpriced at $4.95 in the setting of a menu also offering several pounds of Fried Chicken and Waffles for just fifteen dollars, it also seems as though the Biscuit recipe has become slightly more dry since visiting The Plaza in 2015, though perhaps this has something to do with Yardbird's arrival on the scene with a vastly superior product that is actually priced slightly lower at $7 for four while Hash House a Go Go charges $1.99 each.  Continuing the Thanksgiving feast with two additional holiday specials, HHaGG's signature Snickers Bread Pudding replaced with an equally decadent version made with Pumpkin Bread but similarly decorated with Ice Cream, Whipped Cream and two types of Sauce, it was not without Turkey that the meal would take place, the decision to eschew both a half-pound Turkey Burger and plate featuring sliced Breast plus all the fixins' leaving plenty of room to work on an inverted top-hat made of Cracker-thin Biscuit Dough filled with roasted White and Dark Meat plus shaved Sweet Corn, Mushrooms, Broccoli, Carrots, Red Potatoes and Pan Gravy anchored to the bowl by a generous helping of hand-mashed Potatoes.  ***:  Certainly not a gourmet restaurant, and arguably the sort of place Americans should be rallying against in the setting of an obesity epidemic, Hash House a Go-Go nonetheless provides a good meal at a fair price with service that is better than most while taking several steps that they could get away with not doing in terms of making many of their sauces, jams and gravies from scratch.",

No one was at the receiving desk but after a minute or so we were seated and the waiter was ready for our drink order. He was helpful in decifering the extensive menu. I ordered the massive chicken pot pie and my wife got the fried pork loin sandwich, another huge portion.   The food arrived and was so pretty on our plates, as was the food of the other patrons around us. Presentation was awesome.   Everything was good, but not as good as it looked. By that I mean my pie was a little bland. The crust, while stunning in appearance, was not flaky and buttery, instead it was heavy and dry. The filing was full of healthy veggies and chicken but not enough gravy or sauce for my liking.   My wife said that her sandwich was a little dry and was only OK.  The waiter started out great, and then literally did not return until I requested the check.   So we see potential here but it was not realized yesterday. We both want to return to give them another try and will do so soon.",

Both of those come with sides, but my big eaters could barely muscle through their main course. Unfortunately, they poured syrup on it all before I could tell them to do it bit by bit, so it was no use in asking to pack it home. Their hash's are the best. I love the corned beef hash that comes with potatoes, fruit, a biscuit and eggs, all served in a cast iron skillet. Share it, it's a lot of food!",

    "text": "Came here for breakfast a couple days ago. Never been a fan of this chain to be honest but the wait at IHOP was too long. And with all honesty you get the same quality at IHOP for a couple bucks less.  Let me start by saying that the service was exceptional! The bartender seemed to be the one taking care of us. I want to see her name was limit or a net or something that sounds like that. Extremely helpful even though she had a lot of tables and a lot going on. Very professional, I knew the menu, and always kept our coffees and our water is filled. The three stars just for the food.  I want to head and started off with a traditional bacon and egg combo. Bacon look like it had been cooked way early in the day and simply reheated on the flat top. Dark and caramelized in color but extremely soggy and cold to the touch. Ordered the eggs over medium and well it's kind of hard to mess up eggs so those are pretty good. Went ahead and chose the biscuit as my side and did a side of gravy. Didn't want to fork out the five dollars for biscuits and gravy. The biscuit has a weird consistency. The outermost layer is flaky and Chris while the inside has a very dense and chewy consistency to it. Not in a good way. Tasted more like flower than buttermilk. Highly disappointed. The gravy, sausage gravy, was well seasoned and very good. Went well with my soggy potatoes. Potatoes are also called. I'm used to country style potatoes being crispy on the outside and nice and cooked on the inside. These were soggy all around.  We also had a pancake combo. Pancake with eggs and potatoes. Same thing here. Can't really screw up the eggs so those were OK. Potatoes, or the same. Soggy. Pancake were slightly disappointing.  One side have been cooked a little too long. So while the majority of the top part was nice and soft and tender, the bottom part had a thicker harder chewier layer. Couldn't really get past that.  Honestly like I said, the service was five star by all means. The overpriced food was not.",

    "text": "Hash House was our 2nd choice because the wait at Babystacks was 20 mins too long. When in Vegas, just like in California - I want rapid accommodations. So by default ended up here, and to our luck got seated in less than 5 mins.  My husband ordered the Chicken Benny, and I ordered one of their Farm Scrambles that had bacon, avocado and Swiss cheese. His stacked tower of fried chicken coruscated of greatness, definitely a 5 stars. The chipotle sauce it was drenched in was madly delicious. Wish I could say the same of my meal, the scramble was just okay. And it came with too much mashed potatoes (yes I did order that) and the biscuit was bigger than I imagined. Both kind of dry at first. I asked for a side of gravy (which the waitress mentioned I could put on the biscuit at first). Well, to my dismay, I was charged $4.25 for the gravy (boOoOo!). I didn't contest though, because I used most of it. Just wish she would have told me it was extra -_-.  Service was good, but food coming out was pretty slow. Guess because it was Sunday and they were busy. At any rate, I'd probably order something different next time.",

I played it off at 1st but for the next 25 off minutes we were there she never came back to check on my friend nor did she, or the other 2 waitresses acknowledge us again.

That chicken sure had a nice crunch and some decent flavor. And when are bacon filled waffles not a good idea?   While I enjoyed my epic food, I think I'd like to try something different next time. I saw one of their stuffed burgers go by and it looked huge and delicious! And the bread pudding listed on the menu sounds like a good idea, too!",

Items chosen; chicken waffles (he loved it), apple-cinnamon pancake (yummy and seriously the size of a medium pizza!), kids hamburger (huge, said to be a little oily tasting), and egg white scramble with avocado and sweet potato fries (good).

    "text": "So here's the deal, if your claim to fame is breakfast then one would expect cooks who can provide customers with eggs prepared as you ordered them, right? When our server brought the chicken hash I saw immediately that my requested \"over medium\" eggs had been cooked to hard crispness. Server saw this too and scooped the eggs up and said she would get some cooked properly and left the hash sitting in front of me. I'm not thrilled but decide to eat some of the hash while I wait for my eggs to be cooked. The hash had big chunky cold potatoes in it and the chicken was unappetizing, honestly all very greasy and not nearly as hot as it should be. Also the biscuit was cold and hard and my dining mate said we should call our server back and order something else completely and I had to agree. We didn't see our server anywhere so she asked the hostess if she'd mind sending her over and she literally didn't even acknowledge her asking?! I requested just have some hash browns and a couple eggs with toast instead and found out they only have the greasy chunky potatoes no hash browns. The manager had come to our table when I told the server I didn't want my food and he assured me my potatoes would be hot this time. So my mate dives into her food which is a house salad with grilled chicken. NOT! It was their version of a Cobb salad with big chunks of unappetizing looking chicken plus a grilled chicken fillet on top? We were just amazed that kitchen staff could be so clueless. The manager returned to the table and they brought her another order to go with what she ordered originally. I told him that the hostess was unfriendly and that his kitchen staff must be high to mess up a simple house salad. He obviously didn't appreciate my feedback and told me he couldn't relate to what I was saying nor how I said it. BTW the second set of replacement eggs weren't an over medium either, I'm just saying. I felt somewhat vindicated about eating a crappy meal on my birthday after reading other people's reviews of this restaurant. They obviously have problems with staff and from my point of view back of house needs training on egg cooking and salad making while the hostess gets a lesson in friendliness. Wish we'd gone down the street to Metro Diner.",

Everyone was very friendly, and professional. We went for lunch  and were seated promptly in a booth. We ordered drinks and received them within about 10 minutes. Make sure you have your I.D if you don't they watch your table like drink security making sure your not drinking someone's alcoholic beverage. Really ! But this is Vegas so Kudos... Our food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time  and everyone's meal was served together at perfect temperature.   Atmosphere was very clean and comfortable.

Now we were a big party and we told them that we didnt mind sitting in different booths. The hostess went to see what she could do and when she came back she quoted us a longer time saying it would be an hour! Really?! Then we overheard stephanie with other hostesses say that the server didnt want to take such a big order. We walked out and when I spoke to the manager she went on to say that her staff knew what they were doing . Apparently not if you have people walking out!",

Egg Works never charges for more ranch. Third, they bring you a biscuit without any butter. Fourth, they give you two lousy napkins. I understand that I can ask for butter and napkins but I should not have to. This is basic customer service. In addition, waitress/bartender takes your order and then she never comes back. I have to get up and ask her the bill. Well, never coming back here again. Management is apparently very cheap here.",

    "text": "We chose Hash house for our easter brunch since it was close to the church we were attending. It was a really disappointing experience of gigantic portions of mediocre food.   We ordered the lamb chop hash (medium rare) off the easter menu. It wasn't a hash at all, just two very rare chops on top of potatoes. A hash is diced up meat cooked WITH potatoes, not just put on top. I like rare meat, but the chops were very rare, I should have sent them back.  The biscuit it came with was very dense and dry.   My mom ordered the fried chicken benedict. You couldn't even tell it was a benedict, it was just a mountain of food piled together. It didn't even look appetizing. Lastly was the cobb salad which wasn't bad, but not great either.   I have to agree with Lauren C and other reviewers, I definitely prefer quality over quantity and unfortunately Hash House is all about quantity.",

[Space | Looks] - home-y interior with wood-based furniture throughout. it just replicates your standard southern restaurants and you'll find all their award-winning articles and a picture of martha stewart (lol) posted near the entrance wall. pero like, it felt like a sauna inside.  [Service] - prompt service and our helpful waitress guided us through the menu since i mentioned i did not eat meat and pin pointed all the seafood and vegetarian options.   [Food | Drinks] - if you're hungry (like REALLY hungry), you'll love it here. almost every dish came at a monstrous size. i decided to try something vegetarian-friendly and took on our waitress' recommendation: the portabella mushroom sandwich with pesto and red peppers, which was delicious. if you're a sweet potato fan, replace the fries with that! my boyfriend just had to get the sage chicken and waffle signature dish and he really enjoyed it. bacon is mixed in the waffle, but you have the option to opt out. my bf is generally able to eat heavy portions, but even he was unable to finish his meal. \"only a monster could finish this\" - bf.  we also tried the spiked watermelon lemonade and it was tasty, but where was the alcohol. super sweet and it was straight juice.   [Recommendations] - i wish we had tried more of the menu since hash-hash is known to be a LV staple, but we'll definitely go back when we make the visit again. you can't go wrong with the chicken and waffles as it seems like everyone gets it.   [FINAL THOUGHTS] - hoping to come back soon :)",

Service was friendly but the food was great. BLT's are very standard and simple. There's not too much you can do too it to make it more amazing than it already is. But I added over medium eggs to mine and it was delicious, I forgot about avocado but that would've been good too. The sandwich was so huge I wish you could order half of it. Cause I'm not a fan of taking them home. They don't taste too good as leftovers cause of the hot and cold components. But the food was very ginormous as I expected portion wise.   My boyfriend really liked his Texas Benedict, it's like a Mexican sopes dish with a whole lot of mashed potatoes on the plate. The lemonade was pretty good, however I got my strawberry lemonade with ice and the lemonade is very fresh and sour. So ice would've helped water it down. I asked for some after lol   But overall this place was pretty cool. Definitely a place I'd recommend for people to go to that visit Vegas. It's one you have to try.",

    "text": "I have mixed reviews of this place. It's a nice restaurant. Newly renovated and clean. The staff is always nice and friendly. The food is where it gets tricky.   We came for Chicken and Bacon Waffles. It was amazing! Fresh breaded and fried chicken breast over light and fluffy bacon waffles. It was so good in fact we came back a few days later so my husband could try the same dish. I decided to try a burger I saw on our earlier trip.   Long story short, this time around they served two over cooked, dry, bone in chicken pieces. And the plate had a weird teriyaki sauce everywhere! Like they were trying to make it look fancy. But who wants teriyaki sauce on their waffles!!?? Not us. It was gross. When we asked the manager why it was so different he said that's the way it always comes even when I showed him the photo of the awesome meal earlier with the chicken breast he argued with me and said I missed the bone. What??? I think I know what a chicken breast is. Crazy. We didn't even get an apology or an offer to make it the other way that we enjoyed so much the first day and came back for! Also, I looked up the menu on line and posted a pic that it clearly says \"chicken breast\" on the menu. AND I JUST realized I was also supposed to get 2 eggs!! No eggs were offered either time.   The twisted burger I was so excited to try looks amazing but was also a disappointment. Again with the teriyaki sauce all over the plate and under my burger bun!!!??? Yuck. No. Not that it mattered the burger had SO MUCH SAGE that it tasted like sausage patties.   I posted pics. I'm not sure if we'll go back and it's a shame we really enjoyed our meal the other day. Maybe if we are VERY SPECIFIC about what we order. I don't know, I give this place a maybe.",

I ordered the Chicken & Waffles and they spice up the chicken too much for me. How much rosemary does one chicken need? The waffle was bland. I've had better waffles at Original Pancake House.   I am glad Hash House came to Henderson as I don't like to see buildings sit empty so I was glad they took this space. I understand why a lot of people consider Hash House a regular, I'm just not one of them.   I would like to request that Brannon R. not comment on this review. When people have a negative review of this place he seems to answer in a condescending manner. There's a way to speak to people who have negative opinions of your business without insulting them, and Brannon doesn't seem to know how to do this.",

Their menu ranges from amazing breakfast foods to wraps and burgers for lunch.  I usually go with 5 or 6 people so we will order a large snickers pancakes (you can choose from a wide variety of pancake options) and a griddled french toast (Amish style bread dipped in a banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup) for the middle of the table.    Their #5 bacon, avocado, and cheddar burger is amazing when you are there for lunch or dinner.  For breakfast, I have had \"Andy's Sage Fried Chicken\" which is absolutely incredible.  It is layers of fried chicken, scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuit, and a chipotle sauce on top.  All of their scrambles are delicious as well   The corn beef hash is some of the best I have ever had.  I have never had a bad meal from here yet and will continue to eat at hash house when I am looking to splurge on a large portion meal.   All of the meals are very reasonably priced, between 8 and 15 dollars.",

Sure, the portions are huge, but I can't really justify paying that much money for such low quality ingredients and poorly seasoned food. I had the biscuits & gravy today - the gravy was COLD. Not room temperature, but refrigerator cold. The mashed potatoes underneath were hot so eating it with the gravy made it acceptably warm. I didn't send it back because I didn't want to have to wait for it again. It was also super bland. My SO had the chicken hash, which he said was dry dry dry. My SO, who, by the way, eats microwaveable chicken, even commented on the obviously low quality ingredients.   My coffee only got topped off once, and the waitress (who never introduced herself by name.. is that the policy here?) tried to remove our dishes before we were done eating (utensils were still crossed, also).   Ugh, I don't know why I keep coming back when I KNOW it's not going to be good. All the menu items SOUND good, but the execution is really just terrible.",

It was just ok, I actually thought the banana flavor was going to be part of the fresh toast dip, but it was just carmelized bananas on the side. The french toast itself was a bit dry, which required extra butter and extra syrup. I've definitely had better.  Service was good, the place wasn't too crowded on a Tuesday morning around 11am. Its a big restaurant with what looks like a good sized center bar. I think I still prefer the location on Sahara.",

I enjoy their signature chicken and waffles dish, especially the bacon inside the waffles. Their portions are huge, so share if you aren't hungry enough to eat a horse. Yet, if you're eating the dish solo, know that it's so large your food will be cold before you're done. It would be nice if they super heated the plates to prevent this.   For food, the place gets 4 stars, for service, mostly 3, often times drink refills take a long time or service is just slow. My friend tried a fresh juice, tangerine I think, and said it was too sour, the waitress didn't seem to care.   Go for the chicken and waffles or the banana and brown sugar pancake, but make sure to be hungry!",

    "text": "So I wanted to give this place 1 star because how I felt when speaking to someone on the phone. But the server was nice, you guys had soymilk for my coffee, the food was good and he offered to go drinks, so I bumped it to 3 stars. I recommend everyone get familiar with what \"vegan\" means and whether or not you guys have vegan options. Just because you are catered to meat or most or all of you love meat, when you hear the word \"vegan\" it shouldn't bring negative thoughts to you. My son wanted to eat there for his birthday breakfast because he wanted chicken and waffles. I called to make a reservation and asked at the end \"btw...do you guys have vegan breakfast options?\" Girl on the phone says \"no.\" I asked \"ok...do you have vegan lunch options?\"  She says \"No.\" I said \"Are you serious? So you don't have fries?\" She sounds irritated at this point and explains that she just says they don't have vegan options because she doesn't know exactly what it is. Then asks if i can eat eggs. I say. No...no animal products. All she had to do was put me on hold and ask. Or google wtf vegan means. Vegan options is just as important as knowing if you have gluten free options. Its not a negative thing, people. Vegans are vegans for POSITIVE reasons. Either to not support animal cruelty,  or for health reasons. You don't have to be vegan but please...if you're going to run a food business or work at one, learn what vegan is. She even says \" I know we have a gluten free section, but I don't know if we have vegan. I mean because all of our stuff is still cooked in oil\" so I ask \"ok is it lard? Or do you use vegetable oil?\" She says vegetable oil. Geez...lol. Please Chef of Hash house....know if you have vegan options. I mean even if yall can make a hash scramble without eggs n cheese and u dont use lard or animal broth seasoning, you know if its a vegan option, right?",

Potatoes were supposed to be crunchy they were soggy with no flavor. They came out too fast to be fresh. Vanilla waffle was ok and the bacon is usually nice and crispy, this one was basic. I hope it was just a bad day, so if ever in the San Diego area. The original is much better.",

    "text": "My husband and I workin the food service industry and this is the second time we have visited this location. The food was excellent even though they forgot my avocado and bacon in my burger. When they did bring me the side of bacon and avocado the avocado were brown and gross, me being a server I would have never taken that to a guest. Which was taken care of by the manager and server after waiting 5 minutes for the server. We never saw the manager the server just came out and said the burger was on them per the manager. . My only complaint is that it was slow and there were tables that stayed dirty the whole time we were there. No servers to be found or manager. The hostess was on her phone most of the time and was not very friendly. Coming from a food service industry ourselves where my husband is a manager and I a server you would think they would take pride in their establishment. You would think that customer service is a value as well to an establishment. The food is good but the service here is horrible. The service is what makes me not want to come back nor do I want to recommend this place to anyone.",

My 85 year old grandmother was cold every time the door opened, as they sat our party of 6 at the table right next to the front door and she was very uncomfortable in the chairs so we asked to move to a booth. They weren't busy at all, it was about 9am. When our server asked the hostess if we could move, GABBY (the hostess) rolled he eyes and said \"seriously?\" Yes, seriously. We were uncomfortable where we were seated and needed to be moved. After asking our server and another what her name was, they stated she was new and what her name was. It's no OK to act like that with customers and text while on the clock as we saw her do many times with her phone under the host stand. The food was good as was our server but the hostess and her ways is what will stick i our minds and prevent us from going back.",

He said they were getting ready to close so there would be a very limited menu and employees would be cleaning around us.  We asked if we would be able to eat there and he just shrugged his shoulders.  We said should we just leave and he said probably so.  We went next door to Macaroni Grill and were greeted and seated immediately and served with a smile.  How can Hash House close at 10:00 pm and not be able to serve customers at 9:30?   Not a got way to open a new restaurant in town.",

Ordered there famous chicken and waffles and my wife ordered there special salad with grilled chicken instead of the fried chicken. They brought out the chicken and waffles and the waffles were over cooked and crispy. So I asked to have them remake the waffles yet they still had not delivered the salad at this point. The waitress apologized and said the chef had just gotten there n it would be right out. After another 10 minutes went bye there was no food and no the salad still had never shown up. We had to leave the restaurant and never received any good. Will never ho back or recommend this restaurant to anyone!!!",

I RARELY write reviews, but this restaurant and its staff go above and beyond their job duties to make you feel comfortable and at home. Here's what happened in my case: my to-go box was heavily filled --- have you seen there portions????!--- and it fell over on its side and everything fell on the floor. A shy person's nightmare, correct? Not with Tyler as the general manager. He made me feel right at home, practically took the blame upon himself--and I don't think he was at fault in any way--- and had an entirely new meal made up for me and repackaged to prevent anything wrong happening a second time. Well, to make a long story short, this shy person would feel perfectly comfortable eating wherever Tyler worked!!!! This place has great food and awesome service.",

They seated us at a table, and a waitress came to our table to take our drink order right away.  She brought our drinks and took our order. I was torn between trying their BBBLT and the stuffed burger with cheddar and applewood smoked bacon, the waitress said if it were her, she would go with the BBBLT...she explained it came with seven peices of bacon, and was on thick sliced amish milk bread... it came with your choice of crispy fries, sweet potato fries or a lettuce salad with cucumber dressing.... I chose the crispy fries, my husband ordered the same thing, but with sweet potato fries.  It took about fifteen minutes and it was at our table, hot and fresh... it was good, I think I was expecting it to be great by all the good reviews... it was tasty tho.  The waitress was very good at qher job, she kept our glasses full and asked us if we wanted a to go cup when we were ready to go....All in all it was good, I want to go back to try one of their stuffed burgers sometime....",

    "text": "The breakfast experience I had at this location around 11 a.m. on a Sunday morning was what I would say is a good first impression since it was very active at the time we arrived. We had to wait about 10 minutes up front until we were able to be seated, despite the fact that there were tables available even though the restaurant was very busy. They do have the front set up very nicely though with framed and autographed pictures of various celebrities who've eaten there so that you have something to admire as you wait to be called on. The restaurant was large and neat, and had a country theme inside and outside with their tractor replicas everywhere, including a very large one outside. We learned after being seated that they only offer the breakfast menu during morning hours, and that they have very large portions of food for their meals. The waitress who served us, a young woman named Rachel, was very inviting and friendly. She was very informative about the menu, which was very helpful in our decision-making. We ordered the scrambles of hardwood smoked bacon, avocado, onion, and Swiss, which is a scrambled egg mixture. It had a good taste to it, but there were pretty large chunks of avocado that both my boyfriend and I found unappealing. We had crispy potatoes on the side with a biscuit. Everything came out nicely and tasted delicious! The atmosphere felt a little cramped since they had the tables so close together, but the food wasn't over-priced and we received the food faster than the waiting time it took to be seated. Overall, I would return again to try their lunch/ dinner menu. They had friendly and efficient service and the food was delicious, so it's definitely worth trying!",

The food was absolutely delicious, the chorizo hash has fresh jalapenos not the canned vinegar ones, a pleasant surprise. The flapjack was hot and oh so good! Our coffee was constantly topped off and the waitress was very attentive without being annoying.  When we were ready to leave with boxes, since the portions are huge, we found out that our waitress Amanda was training the other waitress, a young girl with dark hair and glasses.

Our waitress also forgot to ask our order, didn't even come to check on us. Hence, we had no water. Almost wanted to dine and ditch, but being in the service industry myself I did the right thing.",

    "text": "This resturant is a perfect example that huge portions doesn't nessessarily mean good food. I personally would rather have quality over quantity . My meal was meatloaf, eggs, mashed potatoes and a biscuit.  Huge piece of meatloaf that was grilled, but no gravy on anything so everything was super dry. When I asked for a side of gravy to make this meal edible and not so dry, the server ended up charging me $3.95.  This was my third time trying this restaurant and I won't be back.  It's just not good food.",

    "text": "Love everything about the place! Really cute decor - spectacular hash (I had the jalapeno and chorizo, but shared my husband's veggie hash, which was also great). My son had a huge corned beef sandwich - and the meat was perfectly done and very high quality. My daughter had the biggest chocolate chip pancake I've ever seen (I had a bite - it was stellar too!). The manager stopped in to check on us - really great guy who obviously cares about his customers. The soundtrack was fun too - not typical, rather alternative rock from the past 10-20 years, very cool.",

    "text": "I don't know what all this hype is about waiting forever to be seated , waiting forever for the food & rude employees . Granted it is irritating when you are waiting to be sat and you see open tables. Have you ever thought that maybe they are trying to time out the wait so we can experience great service. For a server it is nerve wrecking when they get 3 or 4 tables all at once and they are trying to greet them all at once , & mind you this is a new server in a brand new restaurant. For us we are looking around impatiently wondering why we have not been greeted. As for the food... The food may be the same at all locations but have you thought about the fact that this is a brand new restaurant with brand new employees that are just barely getting their feet wet? Every employee I had an encounter with tonight went above and beyond for me. My server knew the menu enough to sell but still had to excuse himself to find out some information on some questions I had. No big deal, he was new to the menu. And  I would rather have a server excuse themselves while they find an answer for me than assume and my order be wrong. Fried chicken Benny and Sage fried Chicken and waffles tonight were amazing. The kitchen seemed like it fell behind for a bit , but I would definitely say the food was worth the wait! If your impatient and don't like to wait long. Come eat here when right when they open. Otherwise chill out relax and let them fix their kinks..",
