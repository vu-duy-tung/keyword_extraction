But over $10 a head for 2 hot dogs, greasy fries and a drink? I can think of many establishments I can spend $10 on lunch....this one is not on my list.",

We did take everything to go although they offered us to sit inside. Kudos for the niceness.  I had an Italian beef sandwich with the dip on the side. Also got the foot long chili cheese dog.  The food was made fresh and hot.  I really enjoyed the chili cheese dog. It had onions which made the dog for me. It wasn't overly salty.  The Italian beef was a bit disappointing for me. Not that it was bad it just wasn't OMG I need to come back soon for this- good.  You know when you see things on tv and people make it look SOO good?! When you finally try it it is either wow this is so good! Or wow those people's tastes buds may not be as good as mine. Well I felt like I could live without Italian beef sandwiches. It was good but nothing I'd be recommending soon. I would recommend the chili cheese foot long though.  They had one with an Italian sausage I probably should have gotten.   The prices were affordable, the food was fresh and good, and the place was clean. With the friendly staff I'd definitely say check it out.",

We always order 2 Chicago Dogs with everything, 1 Gyro and a basket of chili cheese fries.  They also offer 2 names each day, and if it is your name, you can get a free dog! Never my name but I love to check.  Never had a bad meal here and everything is so fresh and delicious. The owners are always there and you can even bring your dog to sit outside with you. Sometimes they will bring your pup a hotdog and water on the house. So cute and much appreciated by the animals.  They also have done Groupons in the past which was how I found this place and it was a great deal. Hoping they do another one. They are usually voted \"Best of Vegas\". Try it out!!",

    "text": "I had never heard of Chicago-style Italian beef until I moved into an apartment a couple of blocks away from Al's Beef. I looked up reviews on yelp and things didn't look promising, so I held off going. But one night I was watching one of Anthony Bourdain's shows and he went to Chicago and had an Italian Beef. It looked so good I had to have one. I drove to Al's and ordered a hot beef dipped. The place felt like a fast-food restaurant, but I really wanted this sandwich to be good enough. I got the sandwich home, unwrapped it and took a bite...   Bland.   How was the meat so dry? I just watched them pull it out of a vat of warm liquid. It felt like I was eating mushy sandpaper.   So much disappointment.   This set me on a quest for a good Italian Beef in Vegas, and luckily I found Windy City Beefs-n'Dogs.   I walked in, and it's the total opposite of Al's. The people are friendly, and memorabilia lines the walls. You can feel that the people who run this place love it, and in a world of chains, it feels like a real family establishment.   I ordered the #13 beef and sausage, and was surprised to find that the sausage was actually in the beef. I fished it out, put it to the side, and took a bite of the Italian beef.   It was everything that Al's wasn't. Moist, fatty, and salty - the vinegar from the peppers cutting through it all combining to a delicious, perfectly balanced mess. The fries perfectly crisp. The meal is so large I can't finish it all at once, but I'm barely out the door before I start to crave it again. I've been there four times in the last two weeks. As an added bonus - the people here are unbelievably friendly.   This is no high-end restaurant, and the food is by no means fancy. But the price is right, the food is delicious, the people are friendly, and it's just everything you could possibly want it to be.",

The staff is very friendly and attentive. The food is exactly how you'd want it to taste, DA-LICIOUS!   The prices are excellent, not expensive at all.   This place is very small, it's in the big shopping plaza off Lake Mead. There are only a few small TV's, so you can't go here for a good sports watching day. But...it more than makes up for with the quality of food and staff! They have lots of Chicago sports memorabilia on the walls inside, which is a huge plus! Represent!",

Their combos are pretty good and they also serve burgers, Polish sausage, chicken wings/fingers, corned beef, gyro and pizza puff in one small place.  They have TV's on sports channels, a bar and some small tables inside.  There's outdoor seating too.  On the Italian beef sandwich, you have 3 options: dry, wet or dipped.  Dry - juicy but no juices dripping.  Wet - you can eat with or without a fork and knife, it depends on whether or not you want juices on your clothes.  Dipped - so soggy and wet you have to eat with a fork and knife with lots of napkins.   My sister and I both ordered the #4: Chicago dog and a 3-inch Italian beef sandwich with fries.  My sister got a Chicago dog with everything on it and a spicy and wet Italian beef sandwich with everything on it as well.  I got a Chicago dog sans pickles and onions, and a mild and dipped Italian beef sandwich...so good!  The giardinera's perfect.  Definitely a taste of Chicago.",

That was awesome, the hot dog, #3 the chili dog is what I got and loved, the bun stayed together so I was able to actually hold it like a hot dog and eat it, Usually the buns will fall apart and you have to eat with a knife and fork, not this one, it will hold together which was a huge bonus.  I would highly encourage a visit the, instead of 5 I am giving it 4, while the price isn't expensive still seemed a little high, I could see with more business the prices dropping a little bit in the future. Make sure you visit this place and check it out, worth the visit! Really looking forward to seeing a Chicago Bears game at this place, maybe part of a Cubs or White Sox's game as well, just seems like everyone would go crazy!!!",

    "text": "Da dawgs!  If you live in Vegas, you already know you can visit Paris, the Big Apple or Italy with just a short drive to the Strip. So often, however, these Vegas versions leave much to be desired. Our Paris is packed with slot machines and plastic Eiffel Towers full of daiquiris; New York- New York is a watered down, corporate version of the real thing and apart from the gondolas, visiting the Venetian is about as exciting as a trip to Epcot Center, complete with bewildered herds of tourists. But step inside Windy City and bam! There you are in a downtown Chicago hot dog joint, complete with mouth-watering smells, packed with photos from Wrigley and Soldier Fields and staffed by the kind of smiling, friendly Midwestern folk who've made hundreds  of hot dog spots in the real windy city longtime tourist favorites. Like about 80 percent of Chicago vendors, Windy City sells Vienna Beef hot dogs, and the cooks here build 'em any way you want. I recommend you order yours Chicago style: in a warm, soft bun and piled high with tomato, onion, green relish, pickle, sport peppers, mustard and celery salt. (Also, it should be a crime NOT to try the chili-cheese fries.) Grab your dog and head back to any number of the tiny tables lining this narrow, in-love-with-Chicago hot dog heaven. Check out the wall photos of Walter Payton or the Chicago skyline. Lose yourself for a moment in a haze of beef, bun and that warm, world-famous Chicago family feeling. Unlike other themed hot dog spots in the valley, Windy City offers a superior product at a reasonable price, is meticulously clean and actually feels and sounds (thanks to its funny, outgoing staff) like its namesake.  Las Vegas and Chicago: two cities joined at the hot dog (to paraphrase a favorite writer of mine).",

    "text": "My wife is in love with all things Chicago so I decided to try Windy City Beefs-N-Dogs and was pleasantly suprised.  Windy City Beefs-N-Dogs has its strong points and its weak points.  One thing I do like about this restaraunt is that they use very high quality ingredients.  I had a beef and sausage sandwich and the beef was fresh and juicy and the sausage was huge (no dinky small sausage around here).  I also liked this relish like substance they put on their sandwich, which is a combination of carrots, peppers, and onions.  The Au Jus was delicious.    One thing I would say though is this is not a place to go if you are trying to monitor your cholestrol or even lose a few pounds.  Everything is greasy and fattening, but this is not necessarily a bad thing if it is done right (and in this case it is).  The only complaint I had about my sandwich is that it might use some more seasoning as it was slightly bland.  It is possible though this is a more stylistic attribute of the Chicago style food so I can't complain.  All in All Great place.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place after getting a couple glowing reviews from some native Chicagoans.   Walked in on a weekday around 4pm, and it wasn't too busy. Told the girl up front that it was our first time, and she took the time to explain the entire menu to us. Though it took some time, this was much appreciated.   She helped us decide on the #4, which is literally called the Best of Both Worlds. This came with a premium all-beef Chicago Dog (complete with steamed poppyseed bun), as well as a small Italian Beef Sandwich, and fries in a brown paper bag.  I got my Chicago dog the way it comes, for the full experience. The veggies were cold and crisp, the steamed bun was perfectly warm and soft, and the celery salt on top made it perfect. For the beef sandwich, I opted to add the mozzarella and the medium spicy giardinera mix (italian vegetable relish). Unfortunately I got more than halfway through before I realized that even though I had paid for it, the giardinera mix never made it on my sandwich. I did bring this to the cashier's attention, and she was very apologetic. She told me that next time I come in, they would take care of another sandwich for me. I thought this was extremely hospitable and professional. This is how you make things right and create a repeat customer.  Everything was so tasty, I never wanted it to end. Even without the spicy veggie mix, the sandwich was absolutely delicious.   Side Note: THE FRIES ALREADY COME CRISPY!! I love crispy fries so I ordered extra crispy (since I normally have to do this at other places to avoid soggy fries), and I think I ruined them. Should have left them as is. My fault.  Five stars. We'll be back very soon.",

For example, you can get a hot dog \"wet, dry, or dipped\". I, and I'm sure a few other people have no idea what that means. Instead of requiring the cashiers to have to tell the customers what it means all the time, they should put it on the menu. It's a Chicago themed restaurant in Vegas, so that idea would only help. Overall though, great place to go for sausages or a hot dog!",

    "text": "I have been here several times for lunch and this place is packed during that time.  The floorplan is very narrow, so if you plan on eating in, be prepared to have folks standing by your table as they wait in line to place their order during the rush time.  Their man offerings is like the name, Beef N Dogs.  They have a variety of combos available that can get you dogs or beefs (or beefs and dogs) with fries.  I usually get a combo that gives a small beef (3 or 4\" or so) and a chicago style hot dog.  When ordering, you can opt to have your au jus ladled on, dipped and double dipped.  There are also a variety of add-ons you can get such as giardiniera mix, cheese, etc - all at an extra cost, so be careful if you're tight on cash because these add on fast.  I have also heard that their wings are great but I have never personally tried them.  The guy in front of me ordered 23 wings one time and it's been bothering me since then about what a weird number of wings that was...hmmmm....anyway, I hope to try them soon and see for myself if they're tasty.  All of the food I have eaten is tasty consistently except for the fries - which are served in a brown paper bag on the side of your basket of whatever you ordered.  I like fries, but they have come crisp, soggy, etc.  - pretty inconsistently.  I wish there was an option to purchase the food without fries as I'm not that big of a fan of the fries, plus they are an additon that can put the amount of food intake over the top.   The staff has been nice, although we forgot to ask for au jus once and when our food came, asked for it on the side and got a slight ass-chewing for it being extra.  So next time we knew that we best not forget!  Being nice folks, they brought it of course, but weren't happy about it.  Overall, it's a great place for lunch and unfortunately, not too late at night as I have wanted to go there for some food later in the evening and they have already closed.  Thumbs up for super tasty food!",

    "text": "My wife and I stopped by Windy City Beefs N Dogs on a Saturday afternoon outing based on our friend's recommendation. Not really knowing what to expect, we opened the door and were immediately greeted by the staff manning the grill.   We walked deeper into the \"joint\" decorated with Chicago memorabilia (mostly sports) and immediately became overwhelmed with Chicago delicacies on the menu that we knew nothing about (since we are not Chicagoans). Playing it safe, we went with the tried and True Chicago dogs. We each ordered the two dog combo which comes with fries and a drink. After ordering, we got our drinks at the self service fountain, sat down at a table and waited for the food to be prepared. Everything is made to order, so if you are patient, you are in for some great tasting food.   When our food was ready, they brought our wrapped dogs in a basket and piping hot fries in a little brown bag to our table. The dogs looked just like the picture and the flavors of the Chicago dog were amazing (Chicago pickle relish, sliced tomatoes, sporty peppers and celery salt - all of which are offered for sale at the counter).   My wife and I ate, all the while being checked on to see if everything was okay by the employees. We were so amazed by the flavor of these new found favorite hot dogs.   As we got up and headed for the exit, all the employees thanked us for coming in.   We now make special trips to Windy City just for their Chicago dogs.",

The hot dogs and fries are decent but really nothing to write home about.  It's possible to get these kind of dogs at fast food joints, and the buns are kinda on the mushy/soggy side.  Being from the Midwest, I like the Chicago decor, but friendliness is an attribute to that area of the country, and this place fell short of that tonight.   I agree with others that there are no alternatives for turkey, veggie or vegan dogs which is why I could never bring any of my veg friends there.  Who wants to eat just fries?  Not a problem anymore since I won't be back.",

The folks there are also very friendly and they always have ESPN on at least one screen, which is a plus for me. I definitely recommend WCBND, especially their polish sausage and gyro.",

    "text": "This place gets a solid 4 stars for many reasons.  One being the closest to a real Chicago dog from real Chicago peeps I have had outside of Chicago.    The firm but soft bun, the snap of a great dog (however I did not get the vienna dog I hear those are better) the mustard on the dog, the oh so sweet relish that for some reason you cannot find but online, the oh so snappy pickle, the crisp firm onions and the firm pickled spicy sport peppers, oh and don't forget the special salt.  An all and all great Chicago dog!  Oh and a Bag of fries, gotta like that one ;)  However I almost got slightly distracted from my goal and got the Ruben a favorite of mine that I rarely order.  Ok next time...  So the solid 4 stars come from the owners working behind the cook bar, and the fact that they came by twice not just for me but others as well to see how the food was.  The wife-owner also came by to take baskets away (take baskets away at a fast food spot?! AWESOME!)  and make sure you were full.  While we were there a steady stream of people came and went.  I found out they used to have a spot downtown that was recently closed down due to downtown building improvements.    I don't remember people being this friendly in Chicago but I do remember a time when people were this friendly in general.  It was an awesome change as far as treatment goes and I love a small business run how it should be run by people who care.",

I am completely in love with Italian beef/sausage sandwiches, and I have yet to find anything to compare to what I get in Chicago. But, this is definitely the place to go to for these sandwiches in Vegas. If you go on Wednesdays, it's 'Windy City Wednesdays' which means you get a free drink and order of fries if you get the Combo Sandwich. The sausage is a little peppery and nicely grilled, while the Italian Beef is tender and juicy. You can get the sandwiches either dry, wet, or dipped.   I also tried their pizza puffs. Never had one before so I didn't know what to expect. But, what I did get was delicious. As good as it was though, it makes me feel super guilty eating it because the amount of calories it must have.   This definitely isn't the place to go to, if you're looking to trim down. But, they have good food at decent prices.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to give this place a try for sometime now. The location on Eastern is 5 star all the way, but the same vibe isn't felt at this location for me. The menu board above the register is painful to look at because it's awkwardly hanging. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu and checking on us while eating. I ordered a \"Pizza Puff\" combo priced at $4.50 plus 50 cents each for the addition of chili and cheese to the fries, onions were free. The pizza puff had cheese, sausage and sauce inside. It did taste ok. It reminded me of something you got for school lunch when you were younger, but in a very slightly better way. The basket of chili cheese fries is over $4 alone, so upgrading your combo with the addition of chili and cheese for just a buck makes it cheaper for the same size. The fries were good and the onions very fresh. The chili was not god though. I have had canned chili that tasted better. The basket of fries was a huge amount, but I really didn't eat but a few bites and then just couldn't eat anymore so a lot was wasted. I'd give the food here a 2 star rating alone, but I'm factoring service and cleanliness inside, so 3 stars seems fair. They do have some seating outside with umbrellas on the tables for shade. There is a bar with maybe 6-ish stools to sit at or you can sit at a table, but the tables are small (most seat 2 people) and if you get stuck sitting along the back hall area it can feel cramped. Currently on Tuesdays they offer wings for 50 cents each.",

    "text": "I've eaten at the other location in Henderson and really liked it. They also have good deep dish pizza at the other location however the the only pizza you will find at this one is a puff since the menu mostly consists of dogs, sausages, Italian beef and wings. I had a #12 which is a 2 grilled sausages with onions and peppers on bread. The onions and peppers were perfect but the sausage was too dry. Remember I had not just 1 but 2 of these dry sausage to work through. Even with adding mustard it just didn't help. Then my wife and I shared a basket of chili cheese fries however we didn't eat but a small dent in them. After tasting the chili I remembered that I didn't like it at the other location either. Honestly I don't care that it doesn't have beans but what I care more about is that it tastes like a stinky armpit smells. I love chili just not here. My wife ordered a pizza puff that I ended up eating a few bites of and it surprised me how much I liked it. I have had more authentic ones at other places and this one is more like a over-sized totinos pizza roll yet it was damn good. I can't say enough about how nice the staff was. They took the time to show us menus we could read at a table since the menu board here is curved and at a weird angle so you need a neck massage after looking at it too long. Staff checked on us a couple times to make sure we were good and to see if we needed anything so that was a plus. The inside is small with some tables and a bar with stools and they have a couple tables outside.",

If they were in the South West, I'd be bankrupt from eating there 24/7/365.  The most authentic Chicago Beef sandwich in Las Vegas. I get the #10 (Chicago Beef) DIPPED with extra of the hot giardiniera. It comes so wet I need to take a bath afterward, and I wouldn't have it any other way! The beef a jus is delicious (that's why you get it dipped!). Sure it starts to disintegrate quickly, just eat it faster! I used a fork to continuously scrap up the hot giardiniera with every bite. It's almost sad when you have to take that last bite. I'd get a second one to take home but I live like 15 miles away. The sandwich would never last dipped on that journey.  Besides the Chicago Beef the Chicago dogs are great. Again, super authentic. And to top it all off the staff is beyond friendly. They constantly ask you how everything is and if you need anything.  That's not just one employee, but all of them!  Like a said the only real bummer is that there isn't more of these around the city. If I ever hit I big, maybe I can see if they would let me open up another location on the South West side?! One can dream can't they?!?",

    "text": "Staff are friendly and they even hook the kids up with free ice cream at the end! How thoughtful! This review is coming rather late and I seriously thought I typed one on. Apparently not because here I am.  I am by far the most dantiest hotdog eater, ever. I can go years without putting a hotdog in my mouth...cue in long blink...lol. stay focus, stay focus...  The husband is the only reason why we even came here to begin with. He has a co-worker who is from Chicago and says this place is the real deal. Well, if you're like me and don't even know what that really means...apparently, it is. They serve the Vienna brand and I still don't know what that means. All I know is the taste and smell of vienna sausage from a can makes me puke and that's how I associate vienna. So brave me who is trying to get my taste buds out the norm...opt for the Chicago dog.   If you do not know, you're going to want to because it is absolutely delicious. For someone like me who prefers just ketchup and onions on my hotdog whenever I do...the Chicago dog gave me a new appreciation. The hotdog had a snap to it that I do expect of a hotdog. I don't know if it's because it's vienna, I didn't particularly like the flavor of the dog itself...but add in the sport peppers, relish, mustard, tomatoes, celery salt, a soft poppy seed bun and all that other jazz...i was able to overlook it. You can't help but to look around and ask for another one! It was deelish! It comes with pickled Spears as well but I can't stand pickles and relish is as far as I can handle. I don't even like mustard but I decided to not omit so I can get as True to the experience as possible.  My Chicago dog was 5 bucks with fries! Hoody hoo! Husband got some Italian sausage something something...I didn't keep track. I had 4 other heads whose order I had to keep in mind. All I know was he was in big boy heaven. His cost about 7 bucks I believe as his was a sandwich rather than a hot dog.   In conclusion, I believe this place is worth every penny. Everything was made to order and everything tasted very fresh. We are in the area weekly and I know my husband is going to want to come by for his fix...he had one yesterday but I had him try out a different hotdog spot. It's really nice too because customers were coming in and just talking up a storm like you'd see at diners who are clearly frequent customers. So that makes it feel pretty homely.  Highly recommend if you are in a hotdog mood and you got more spare to change so that a hotdog fix doesn't consist of a trip to your local wholesale warehouse. =P",

I placed my order and it was ready in about 10 minutes, just as they were closing the doors.  The Chicago dogs were flimsy -  I think they had put most of the condiments away and this was the remnants and I asked for sauerkraut also -  about 1 tablespoon on top.  It was all pressed into the bun not appetizing at all.  Also got a chili dog -- the chili was just poured on to the point that the bun was a soggy mess.  Lastly the fries that were part of the meal were also the remnants from the fry tray -  the bag that they supply was not even half full.  I won't be back.",

We got ours dry with the au jus on the side, the better to dip the sandwich & fries in. Those fries! They were hot & crispy served in a brown paper bag. They are among the best fries I have encountered in Las Vegas since moving here. The employees were very helpful & friendly. Windy City gets my highest recommendation for both food & service.",

    "text": "So far Windy City Beef-n-Dogs is the best Chicago style fast food I've found in Vegas. Too bad it's on the opposite side of town from where I live or I'd go there more often.  They have all the real stuff- Vienna Beef dogs, poppy seed buns, Italian beef, sausage, Maxwell St. Polish, even pizza puffs and tamales. I think they even have Old Style beer on tap!  You can't beat the 2 dog special with fries for $6 when other places in town are charging $6 + for a single dog!  Their beef/sausage combo is as good as any I've had in Chicago. I hadn't had one in almost 2 years and it was really good stuff although a bit expensive.  I think they just recently added gyros sandwiches to their menu and I had one the other night. As with their other stuff the portion was ample and it was made with care. My only gripe is they are using pre sliced gyros and don't have the whole spit - rotisserie setup. I would encourage them to get the whole setup. I know it must be an expensive outlay originally, but having a good gyros in the lineup completes the Chicago menu nicely.  The restaurant looks like it's a family run place. All the people behind the counter are real Chicagoans who put the necessary care into the food and they really respect the tradition. It shows in the quality and taste.  If you want to have your own Chicago cook out, they even sell all the dogs, beef, sausages, buns and fixings by the pound to take home.  I'll continue to go back when I can. How about opening a Henderson location? :-)",

This place has legit Chicago everything. Real Maxwell St. Polish and Italian beef.  The Giardiniera is authentic Chicago-style, awesome--no nasty vinegar, just high quality olive oil. If you live too far to get lunch here regularly, I'd stop in and buy Giardiniera to go, it's just that good.  If you're from Chicago you will appreciate a True dipped beef sandwich, an absolute mess of deliciousness. Truly the taste of home. There's nothing like watching the Bulls win or the Cubs lose while enjoying an authentic beef sandwich.  For non-Chicagoans, I can't promise that you'll love it.

At first, we thought it might've been on the pricier side, but after getting our food, you can definitely see from the portion that you're getting your money's worth.  We split things in order to try everything. We split a dipped Italian beef sandwich, a Chicago dog, a pizza puff, and fries.   The Italian beef was perfect and exactly how it should taste. The Chicago dog was good, as were the fries.  With the pizza puff, i think I was expecting more cheese, but it was more of a meat sauce in it. Still good, just unexpected.   Overall, a pleasant place to eat and would be willing to return.",

You order your food at the cashier then find a table yourself.   #4 Windy City's Best of Both Worlds - Vienna Hot Dog & Fries and a 3\" Beef Sandwich - (Vienna Premium Beef Hot Dog served on a Steamed Vienna Poppy Seed Bun with all the fixings, Mustard, Onion, Green Relish, Pickle Spear, Tomatoes, Sport Peppers sprinkled with Celery Salt, a 3\" Italian Beef Sandwich made with thin slices of Freshly Cooked Beef with our own Au jus served on a Gonnella Italian Style Roll, Served Dry, Wet, or Dipped. Served with Fries) - I got my sandwich wet with medium peppers (serrano/jalepeno level? apparently their hot was habenero level.... ouch)  The hot dog was pretty good. Soft bun with all the fixings. pickles and tomato gives it a nice crunch and bright flavor. Pretty good compared to the normal hot dog from like Sam's Club (big price difference but thats not the point here LOL)   I was told about this place after trying Big Al's and their dipped sandwiches. I opted for wet vs dipped because i've read reviews (maybe not for this place specifically) but dipped may be too wet and hard to eat. To be honest, even wet was quite uhm wet. Flavors seemed pretty comparable to Big Al's. Maybe i'm not too experienced or knowledgable in this style of beef sandwiches so i cant say much. Still pretty good overall.   The price of this combo is actually not bad. Got me quite full. Should opt out from getting a drink and ask for a water cup though. Adding a drink bumps price from $7.95 + tax to over $11 after tax. XD (im a cheapo shush).",

While I was in there today, the owner was in training a new girl. She took great care looking around the place to make sure everything was up to par. It definitely shows that the employees take great pride in the place.   I like how you can sit at the bar and watch your food being cooked. You know there is nothing to hide that way.  I have eaten here numerous times and I will always go back when I am on that side of town. Absolutely the best Chicago Dog and Italian Beef sandwiches in town. I have also had their sausage and beef combo sandwich and it is fantastic.   My usual order - the #10 dipped, very wet, sweet peppers, cheese, and hot giardinera. Fries and a drink.    The hot giardinera is really tasty and spicy. They also have mild and medium giardinera if you don't want that much spice.   Trust me...check this place out!  You'll love it!",

The main difference is that where I went in Chicago had wedges of tomato vs slices. Not a big deal, but you know... its kind of like \"not how my momma made it\" sort of thing. The italian beef is pretty close to spot on. Its a little less spice than Al's in Chicago. My recommended way of having it is \"wet\", with sweet peppers and I almost always add the melted cheese.

All the parts of the dog were good, but they didn't add up to much.  The dogs are high quality Vienna Beef, and have a great snap.  The only other ingredient that made the dog distinctive were the tomatoes.  I expected the bright green pickle relish to contribute something significant to the flavor profile, but it really didn't.  The poppy seed bun was unremarkable.  I ordered a combo that came with a bag of french fries.  The french fries photographed well (LOL), but they were totally limp.  Nobody like limp fries.  Clearly I should've went for a bag of Jay's chips.  Now, I realize all this just doesn't add up.  It must be my fault.  Clearly, I must have eaten it wrong.     I failed on my first try, but I'm not giving up.  I'm definitely going back to Windy City next time I'm in town. I'm gonna have a Chicago Dog and I'm gonna like it.

The dogs at Windy City just taste better and have more of an \"authentic\" vibe to them instead of place like the one in Honolulu that's \"trying\" too hard to be a Chicago dog.  Stepping in here for the first time, I knew it was going to be good because for a cold, Tuesday evening, it was packed and with many walk in take out orders.  There was even one lady that came in to order a couple of dogs to go dressed in her house robe.  Like she was at home watching The Voice and decided she wanted a hot dog and walked over. ;)  The 2 things I've tried here...  The combo Italian beef and sausage sandwich (#13).  Large amounts of shaved beef piled on top of an Italian sausage (mild or hot) which is sandwiched in an Italian roll.  This thing was HUGE!  You can get other stuff added to it like Cheese (cheddar or mozz), Sweet peppers, and Giardinera.  I ordered mine with a spicy sausage, sweet peppers and medium giardinera...and with the whole sandwich dipped in beef jus!  It was hard to eat but I managed...hehe.  On the second visit, I had to try one of the dogs so I got the Footlong Vienna Maxwell Street Polish Dog (#16), another monster.  This polish dog is steamed then fried which gave it a nice snap when biting into it.  The dog is topped with grilled onions, mustard and sport peppers.  I got mine with nuclear green chicago style relish.  Super filling and delicious.  This one comes with fries as well!   Mark H had the Chicken fingers on both visits and he said they're really good.  Service on both visits was super friendly and the food came out quickly.    Wind City is a must come back to for me.",

A quick Yelp search for lunch spots brought me here and since I had such good luck in the area for breakfast I figured I would roll the dice on getting a real Chicago dog just a few miles outside the strip.  Tucked in a strip mall I knew this place was the real deal when I walked in.  If someone blindfolded you and dropped you inside you would swear you were on South Wacker and not in the middle of the desert.     Got the Chicago Dog (of course) and chili cheese fries since I had some calories to replenish.  The dog was awesome, the real deal - onions, relish, peppers, pickle, tomato, celery salt and the signature poppy seed bun.   Cooked perfectly - great snap and all the toppings were fresh and delicious.  Same deal on the fries - thin and perfectly crisp with a great later of chili and cheese on top.  Not sure if it's intended to be a single serving but it was for me!  Believe the reviews - this place nails it!!",

Staff is very friendly and the restaurant has lots of decoration featuring Chicago sports.",

I'm not sure at what point they added the salt but it was way too much. That's why the 3 stars. Other than that this real deal chi town beef spot would have been better. They have Vienna dogs with the works and also sausages both polish and Italian style. For me the salt killed it.   I will be back but next time I will try their daily specials.

I'm originally from northern Illinois, about 90 miles outside of Chicago. My wife had never been to Illinois until a couple of years ago. While there we went to Taste of Chicago where she had her first Chicago dog and immediately fell in love.  We have been to Windy City twice in the past two weeks since discovering it. The second time we invited my parents who also were in search of a little taste of home.  The first time we went, my wife got the Chicago dogs and a Green River (limey ginger ale soda). I got the Italian sausage and a pizza puff. I'm not  a big fan of hot dogs, but my wife confirmed they were solid reproductions of authentic Chicago dogs. The Italian sausage was decent. I had never had a pizza puff before and am now a fan. My wife's meal came with fries which were really good, nice and thin and crispy. Just the way I like them.  The second time we went my wife again got a Chicago dog. I got an Italian beef sandwich. I don't think I'd ever had an Italian beef sandwich before. I got mine dipped with cheese, peppers, and giardinera. I liked mine a lot. I think I'll get that again. I might get it wet though, which ironically is drier than the dipped. The dipped was really good but the sogginess made it difficult to eat.",

The polish and fries can't hang with that of Byron's, next time I'll try something else. My kids had hot dogs, which they loved! My husband had the dipped combo and chose the spicy sausage topped with hot giardinieras. He said it reminded him of Al's in Chicago (that's a good thing).   Even though I didn't like what I ordered, my husband and kids did. It was an overall good experience with friendly staff and clean surroundings.",

And when I say that, I mean trouble for the other hot dog chains out there. this hot dog joint is more of a keeper than your mama's pearl earrings given to you when you turned 16.  There's nothing fancy about this place and its eats. And that's how a hot dog joint should be. Came in and it's a lil more spacious than your average hot dog stand on a street. i ordered my hotdog(#1) with some fries and a drink. my order came faster than i can take a picture for yelp. but of course not like a fast food chain. when the lady delivered my food, i can smell the freshness of the hot dog, peppers, mustard, even the poppy-seeds(jk). but the thin freshly fried seasoned(lowry's?) fries were double the amount of the hot dog, which was able to fill me up. it came in a basket, in your typical brown paper bag and paper wrap with no name. anti-fancy. thank you for that. did i forget to say how delicious the food was? yes, there's not much to do when it comes to hot dogs, just the hot dog, bun, and a bunch of toppings. but they fulfilled the meat's destiny just right.   oh, you bet i'll be back.",

My friends also swear by their burgers. Lots of people were getting the polish dog that day and it looks enormous (ha ha insert joke) and very delicious - going to get it next time!  The staff here is also super friendly and I believe it's a mom and pop shop, which makes me want to go back even more!",

It was 10:45 am and I wondered if they would be open.....they were, lucky me!  I was greeted by the owner and his Wife.....at least it appeared as if they owned the joint.  They were very friendly and welcoming.  It's a casual restaurant with 10 or 12 tables inside and 8-10 counter seats near the grill.  There's also a few tables outside with umbrellas if you like to dine outdoors.  I browsed the menu and was getting excited with every item I saw.....Vienna Beef Dogs, Beef Sandwiches, Iltaco Pizza Puffs......WAIT, Pizza Puffs?!  Holy $hit, that changes everything....I love those things!  I couldn't control myself, so I ordered a #2 Two Chicago Dogs w/Relish, Pickle Spear, Tomato, Hot Peppers, Mustard, Onions, Seasoned Salt....and Fries ($6.00)....plus I ordered a Pizza Puff ($3.50) and washed it down with a bottle of Coke Zero.  Dammit, there goes the diet!  The lady asked for my name and asked if I was dining in or taking out....I told her dine-in.  I saddled up to a table and anxiously waited for the food.  While I was waiting I noticed a man with his Son sitting at the counter.  They were eating Chicago Dogs and he was telling his Son how a Chicago Dog is made and how it should taste....the owner, who was grilling it up was there telling the kid about how to make the Dog....it was awesome.  After a few minutes my order was ready.  The lady brought it out to my table....I unwrapped both Dogs and the bag of Fries and put them together on one wrap so I could eat it uninterrupted.  She told me the Pizza Puff was still cooking so it would be a few minutes....that's pretty standard to wait for Pizza Puffs, so I didn't care.  The Dogs were covered in Mustard, which is how I like it.....if you don't like too much Mustard on your Dog, I suggest you tell them ahead of time.  The first bite was an explosion of Awesome on my taste buds....it was sooo good!  The Vienna Beef Dog was full of flavor and the combination of toppings was just how I remember the Dogs in Chi-town.  The Relish is the atomic green colored stuff you find in Chi-town.  This place is legit!  The Fries were piping hot and seasoned with a Salty seasoning....if you don't like your Fries too Salty, then I suggest you either ask for them plain or tell them easy on the seasoning.  I liked it.  It complimented the Dogs just right.  The Dogs were average size.....not too big, do don't expect a 1/4 lb Dog with the #2.  I think they offer larger Dogs with other combo meals, but not with the #2.  The Pizza Puff came out shortly after I started eating.  I waited until I was done with the Dogs before I moved over to that bad boy.  It was wrapped in the traditional Iltaco Pizza Puff wrapper.....those of you familiar with Pizza Puffs know what I'm talking about.  I bit into the greasy, flaky, doughy Crust and mmmm.....yeah, it's the Pizza Puff that I've grown to love.  Inside of the flaky, doughy Crust is a filling of Pizza Sauce, Sausage, and Cheese.  Dammit, these things are addicting and I just discovered this place....I have a feeling I will be here often.  The owners were very attentive and asked if I was ok and needed anything.  After I was finished, they asked how I liked it....I gave them the thumbs up and a big smile.  They were smiling too and said \"See you soon Peter!\"......I love family owned businesses who pay attention to their customers.  While I was there 6 or 7 people came in and they knew all of them by first name.  I hope I get to know them better too.  Will I return?  This place has won my clogged artery Heart....you bet I will!  Now, back to the gym to burn off these calories.",

This isn't the case here. I had heard from a few people that this was the place to get a hotdog in Las Vegas. Walking in I had no idea what I wanted, being from Australia hotdogs are not really a staple or rarely served. I asked the nice lady behind the counter what are the two best hotdogs to get and she served me up the chill dog and a Chicago dog.  The decor of the place is Chicago, from sporting teams, city pictures and other great trinkets from Chitown.  The food was great, the service was better! And I will say go where the locals go, eat what the locals eat, well this is where people from Chicago go eat!",

The menu was rather impressive, boasting more than just hot dogs. They offer a variety of sandwiches and burgers, along with the dogs. I contemplated a burger, but opted for a Chicago Style Dog. The dog was pretty good, the french fries were average. The combo will run you about ten bucks. This is one of those places with limited space inside, so avoid the traditional noontime lunch, if you are able, or you will be cramped at a little table. They do have some outside seating, which is only a viable option if the outside temperature cooperates. The staff was friendly and attentive, but the cramped quarters were kind of a turn off.",

It's just a preference and is not a reflection that this place is bad. I think if you're feeling a Chi-dog, this should be on the short list as this is pretty close to what I've had in Chicago.     The beef sandwich comes with different options: au jus- dipped, wet or side, cheese, giardiniera- hot or mild. I put my au jus on the side and good thing since the sandwich was already kind of wet and falling apart. I didn't feel the au jus added much and half the cup was oil. The giardiniera was pretty good and I got the hot kind and it was spicy! That was just okay and just a bit too soggy and greasy for my liking.  Just doesn't settle right with me- Windy City indeed! I blamed it on my MILs old dog though! The fries were thin cut, seasoned well and crispy- these are how I like my fries! My BF also got the same combo and the MIL and grandma split one and sandwich was the least favorite.  My MIL got the footlong chili and cheese dog w/ fries ($5.75) and I took a bite. I'm not a chili type person, but I try a bite whenever my BF or MIL order chili items and this was pretty good. The BF said he'd order it next time and she thought it was tasty.  The service was alright. There was a mistake on the order, but they were quick to correct it. The lady who brought us our order came back to check on us and was friendly. This really isn't a full service place though- the drinks, condiments, utensils, trash is DIY and you order at the counter.   I can see why people like this place as it's comfort type foods. I can't really say my experience was 4 star worthy as there was aspects of the food I liked and then there are parts that fell short. I think we will return specially since the in laws enjoyed themselves. I would like to try their Polish sausage since it's grilled to get snappy next time.",

Now I can tell you that the beef sandwich from Windy City is one of my favorite sandwiches I've eaten... I get mine wet with the medium gardinier(sp) and mozzarella... Such a great flavor combo!! The bread does get soggy, but that doesn't bother me one bit. Just makes you eat it faster. The service is top notch, the staff is always super friendly... Overall I highly recommend Windy City and will continue trying new things from there each visit... Did I mention they have frozen cheesecake on a stick??!!",

In the past I've had the Chicago style Polish...and boy was it spot on. Today I'm trying the Italian beef, wet, with extra hot and sweet peppers. I also opted to try two versions of their mild sauce to see if it's that Chicago mild that I know from back home...they were both good, but far from the mild sauce I know. The color for the south side mild was correct...but it didn't taste the same. The buffalo mild color was almost there...that didn't taste the same as back home either. They both were good in their own ways though. The italian beef was very tasty...just a different from what I know, but it was still good. Overall taste is it's own version of Chicago that's close enough for me for most items, especially when you've been going through years of withdrawal from \"back home food\", and spot on for the dogs for sure. I'll be back",

    "text": "I need to start this review by saying that I have never had a Chicago beef sandwich before. I went with a friend who is from Chicago and recommended this place. She considers it to be extremely authentic and has been here many times.  We split the 9-inch beef sandwich with cheese. We also shared an order of fries. I found the bread and the beef to be very fresh. I probably would have liked the sandwich a little bit more with the peppers and other garnishes, but since we were splitting, we ate it plain with just the cheese. The french fries were delicious. It seems like they make them from scratch with real potatoes but they are cooked longer than the in-and-out style fries.  Drinks are self-serve from a fountain that offers Coke products. Diet Coke, not Coke Zero, in case you're one. They also have a cooler with some bottled drinks.  Something that I found extremely nice about this place was the service. You order at the counter and pay and then they bring you your food. I was surprised at how much attention we got from that point on. Usually once you've done that, you are on your own. Not here! A couple of times they came to check and make sure we didn't need anything like ketchup and in the end to see if we were ready for them to clear our table. Definitely Midwestern hospitality. Also, they run a clean restaurant!  I was impressed with how busy they were. There were customers filling the inside of the restaurant. It was a beautiful day so we sat at a table outside.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood for a Chicago beef or a fancy hot dog.",

They greeted us very well and took our order and didn't mention anything about closing. We apologized once we realized we walked in as soon as they were getting ready to close. We felt so bad because we hate being \"those LAST customers\" but the staff was so nice and told us not to worry about that .  My husband ordered the number 10 based on recommendation. And he ordered it wet. With lots of cheese. I don't remember what it was exactly called but it had LOTS of flavor. It was a little too wet for my liking, but he enjoyed it. And the size was BIG.   I ordered the number 1; a lot smaller in comparison lol. But good amount for me .  More on the plain side but still yummy. It does come with peppers so it has a kick to it.   THE FRIES were one of my favorite! I LOVE fries and I can say WINDY CITY has some GREAT fries.  The style is very Chicago theme. They have all sorts of pictures on the wall and it all relates to Chicago. We didn't have too much time to take a look around, but I'm sure next time we will.   Customer service was GREAT. Thank you WINDY CITY DOGS .",

This is a counter-serve joint and the dining area is decorated with Chicago memorabilia.  I ordered the Chicago dogs and fries. It delivered an authentic style hotdog with all the traditional windy city fixings. I like the celery salt on the dog, it gave that extra pop to go with the tomatoes and sport peppers that came with it.  The 2nd order is the  \"Windy City's Maxwell Polish\" and I liked this better and this one is a Vienna Polish sausage and you can get it plain or spicy, and I chose spicy. They steam the sausage then grill it and serve it on a Vienna poppy seed muffin with mustard, grilled onions and sport peppers.   I also ordered their Chicken wings and the sauces for the wings are mild to hot and you can request the sauce to be tossed or on the side. We thought the wings were so tasty.  They all came with a side of fries and were perfectly crispy and topped with a season salt.  Most menu items are under $10 for hot dogs and sandwiches. Prices are fair.

They also have a name of the day board featuring a male and a female name, and if your ID shows it to be your name you get a free hotdog. Let's talk about the important stuff; a large menu of dogs every imaginable style, all made with Vienna Beef products. I went for the foot-long street polish dog; served with spicy mustard, grilled onions and jalapeno peppers, a devoured that thing and wished I could go for more, but I was full. I am determined to return try every item on the menu!",

I have tried a few places in the Vegas area but tonight I found out about Windy City.  The dogs are Vienna and served exactly the right way including sport peppers and celery salt.  The Italian beef is scratch made and as good as the best Al's in Chicago.  If I had one minor point it would be the fries. They're good even have seasoning salt but they are frozen instead of fresh cut. Dont worry I still ate them.  If your craving a taste of back home, stop in for a bite. Get the number 4, a dog and a 1/2 beef sandwhich. You'll be hlaf you did",

Seriously warms my heart!  Everything we have ever ordered from Windy City has been delicious and freshly made! Hotdogs, yum. Wings, better than the other guys. French fries, yes please. Pizza Puff, mmmmm!  But NOTHING can compare or even stand a chance against their ITALIAN BEEF SANDWICH! (with everything; don't you dare take anything off of it.) (WET; they dip the entire sandwich in au jus and you can get it as wet as your heart desires.) You CANNOT order this sandwich without having them dip it into the au jus. I would think that would be somewhat illegal somewhere. There is some sort of 'relish' that they slap on there that has carrots, peppers, onions that will literally knock your socks off. That relish with the thinly sliced juicy roast beef, gooey cheese, and the savory wetness from the au jus will do a number on your tastebuds. Trust me. My mouth is literally salivating as I type this. If you've never tried it, I judge you. Hard.   Go there. Order it. Then thank me later. Kbye.",

    "text": "So this place has been on my bookmark list for quite sometime now and I actually had to plan my visit here considering I live on the opposite side of town. I was around the Summerlin area and said why not pay Windy City a visit. So I've been to Chicago and tried the Italian Beef at Portillo's, which was probably the best thing I ate there. The inside of this place is very mom and pop-ish, surprisingly they didn't have much bears or clubs memorabilia, it appears they are more oriented towards the blackhawks and bulls. Anyway onto the food I ordered the Italian beef sandwich combo, came out to $9 and some change (not bad). I ordered mine to be wet, because I felt like the dipped would be too drippy. The beef was pretty good for the most part, but the bread did not adsorb the liquid very well. I was honestly expecting this to taste a lot like Portillo's and unfortunately it did not. The bread really ruined the sandwich because it became really soggy. No, I did not wait to eat my sandwich it was already soggy by the time I got it. My friend who is from Chicago said the same thing, it's definitely a bread issue. He said they should have bread flown in from Chicago and that would do the trick, but realistically speaking that won't happen. I would suggest using Great Bun's French bread, but I don't know if that would be authentic Chicago style? But obviously the hoagie they are using now is not working. Next time I will order the Pizza Puff, since I've never had those before and the combo meal for that is only $4.50. Or maybe even the hotdogs considering that's part of their name sake.",

Pretty solid chili dog, not over powering nor too bland. Good middle of road chili. Dogs were fresh and cooked through.  Cheese felt freshly grated and onions had some bite.   Also, ordered the Italian beef with mozzarella, sweet peppers and mild giardiniera served \"wet\".  First off this sandwich was huge. There's no skimping on ingredients here. Lot's of meat, peppers and cheese.  Being from SoCal this was my first experience with this Chicago icon.  The one thing I would do differently is order it \"dry\" with the au jus on the side.  Not really down with \"wet\" sandwiches. I can now cross this off my to-eat list.   Additional I'd like to point out they were very accommodating with one on my kids special request, two plain dogs, just grilled. Also, one of the staff gave a scoop of sherbet on the house after our meal.   Little things like being greeted by a business that is genuinely glad you see you to a free scoop of ice cream add up to a very enjoyable experience. In the words of Arnold \"We'll be back\".",

There probably is another brand of bread that's available around here that's more like Gonella which would boost the authenticity rating up a notch or two, but with all of my nit-picking aside Windy City is a great choice, and in my opinion even better and more authentic than both Rossatis's (pizza pub) and Al's (which is supposedly a Chicago tradition and recently closed up after 2 years of business in Las Vegas)",

You can't beat their Chicken Wing Tuesdays.  Each wing is 50 cents and deep fried to order.  They cook the wings until they are crispy outside and juicy inside and can be tossed with your choice of mild, medium, or hot wing sauce.  They use Vienna brand hot dogs and buns which are delicious (and don't give me the usual hot dog indigestion!)    Windy City also makes their own giardiniera with different levels of spiciness and is to die for!    Don't forget to try their Wunderbars!  Frozen, chocolate dipped cheesecake on a stick!

    "text": "My husband and I usually get take-out on Friday nights and Windy City kept popping up on my Yelp app. We decided to give it a try and it's now in our permanent rotation! It's a cute little hole in the wall celebrating all things Chicago. The walls are covered in memorabilia and everyone behind the counter is dressed in Chicago garb. The first time I visited I came in and placed our order and sat at the counter and waited for the food. They were quick, efficient, and super friendly. They used my name and asked me how I was doing. Everything smelled fantastic and I couldn't wait to get home and dig in!   My husband got the #4 - a Chicago style dog and a 3 inch Italian beef with fries. This is definitely a great deal, you get the best of both worlds. I settled on an Italian beef, dipped with mozzarella, and a side of fries. OMG! I fell in love with Italian beef sandwiches in Chicago and this one hit the spot for me. You definitely want it dipped with ooey gooey mozzarella. The sandwich is huge and delicious, I completed gorged myself, leaving only one bite. The fries are shoestring and completely satisfying. Great customer service and delicious food, we were immediately in love. The next time we ordered, we decided to try their chicken wings. My husband love wings and I can appreciate a good wing as well. These are the best! We now split an order (there are 13 in an order, plus fries) and are completely happy. The wings are crispy and huge. The sauce comes on the side, which isn't my favorite, but I don't mind too much because they have so much flavor anyway. Last time we ordered we also tried a pizza puff, basically a step above a hot pocket, but lots of flavor.   No need to get on a place to satiate those Chicago craving, just hop in your car and give them a try!",

I am from the Midwest (Wisconsin to be precise) and have visited Chicago a few times. I have had a few good Italian Beef sandwiches in my time and I'm impressed with this place. Not only are the prices reasonable, and the portion sizes are great. I got an Italian Beef sandwich with mozzarella for $8.oo and was completely NOT prepared for the amount of sandwich I was about to get. It gave me two meals. Two delicious meals. Their hot dogs are ACTUAL hot dogs, void of that crazy thing called ketchup.  The service is great and fast. I ordered and only had to wait for a minute or two before my food was served to me. The staff was also very friendly and knew what they were doing. The place also has some crazy specials that go on. Seemingly random things, like \"If your name is Nancy, you get a free drink!\" Which I mean, is awesome if your name is Nancy, lol. They keep calenders around to in case you want to pick up one. I have found an Italian beef place and look forward to going back. I highly suggest it if you want a lot of food for the money you spend. They also have a sister store down in Henderson called Windy City Beefs-N-Pizzas, which I'm going to check out soon. :)",

If you've had one while in Chicago you know these are close in taste to the ones in Chicago but not as good. Maybe it's just me or my excitement of being back to my old stomping grounds. If you are in the Chicago area hit up Portillos. My sandwich came with cheese, giardiniera and some sport peppers on the side. The giardiniera was delicious and a perfect complement to the sandwich. It adds a nice kick (don't worry it's not to spicy) and crunch. I'd say on a level of 1-5 I'd say a 3 or 2.5 in spiciness. You can have it dry, wet or dipped. Dipped is to messy for my. I asked for wet and i almost thought it was dipped. Sandwich was falling apart on me. So I had to pull out the utensils (that made me sound sophisticated!). I made it a combo. That adds fries and a soft drink or how my family says in the Chicago \"pop\".  The fries come in a brown paper bag. I first I was like \"that's it?!\" But at the end I couldn't finish my meal. There is another one near my home. It's at Eastern and Silverado Ranch. If you want to try something new and delicious don't hesitate to get a taste of Chicago!",

The Italian sausage was to die for. So tasty. They give you the option on if you want your sandwich dipped, wet, swimming, etc depending on how juicy you'd like it.  It was a huge sandwich by the way. I took half of it home for leftovers and I still didn't finish it!  The staff was very nice, the food came out quick for how busy it was, and it was an overall great place to hang out and watch the baseball game while getting some good food! It looked like they also have a unique deal every day so that was pretty cool too!",

I ordered the Chicago style dog with fries, and my husband ordered the chili dog with fries, and we took the food to go. After placing our order, we received our food pretty fast and the employees here were super friendly! That was a nice experience.  I haven't had a Chicago style hot dog since I was in Chicago about 3 years ago. I'm so happy to say that when I tried it here, it tasted almost just as good as I remembered back in the Windy City! The quality of the sausage is so good and all the toppings go so well with each other. My husband LOVED the chili dog. I tried his as well, and I will definitely be getting that next time we come here. The fries taste good as well. Since we brought the food home, I added a little garlic salt to my fries and it transformed them!  I definitely recommend coming here for hot dogs and fries! They do have other items on the menu as well, so also give those a try! I will be",

Now the best was to describe this place is first the moment you walk in it feels and smells like a Chicago beef n dogs place Should smell. The intoxicating smell of grilled onions, mustard mixed in with aroma of French fries, pickles and relish. I ordered the Maxwell st. Polish. With a side of fries. Polish was perfect poppy seed bun. Sweet relish hot peppers and the tangy mustard. The staff is very friendly and inviting. Food is great. This place is sort like a Chicago Embassy in Las Vegas.

Full disclosure: I'm not from Chicago.  I've been there, I've had Chicago dogs and Chicago beef sandwiches from there, but I'm not what you would call a local.  That being said, the dog and beef at Windy City were as authentic as any I'd had in Chi-town.  #FightMe  I liked the diner-style atmosphere and I ate at the counter.  The beef was completely dipped, which meant messy as all git-out, but that's just what I wanted.  It was so tasty, too... very full of beefy flavor, but with a nice savory, herby note to it.  The mild giardiniera was the perfect compliment.   I had the combo with the dog, so I got to try a bit of both worlds.  Not only did they have all the right toppings, but they even included the celery salt.  And the poppy seed bun!  Nice touch.  The fries were freshly made and served nice and hot.  Well seasoned, too.  Yeah, they came from the freezer, but they were good freezer fries.  I had a tamale, too, but that was mainly to try the chili, which was nice and hearty.  The tamale was definitely an Americanized version, but it was filling.  The staff was really friendly, despite the fact that I was there about a half hour from closing.  They genuinely seemed to enjoy their jobs, which is always a great thing to see.  They made me feel welcomed.    Overall, a great find and a wonderful experience.  Thank you for a fantastic meal and a quick trip to the Windy City!",

It's funny when they bitched about sharing a soda but they said nothing about sharing fries.    This is not a company that helps the elderly as far as their policy's.

First, this place is small and the tables are limited and close together, there is a bar that allows you to sit grill side, and some tables outside. You walk all the way in to place your order and since this place was packed, I grabbed us a table and my husband stood in line to order.   The dogs came out quickly, and we dug in, I got the polish sausage and fries. Served on a poppy seed bun and served with grilled onions, and the hottest peppers. The fries were fresh out of the fryer, so they were hot and crisp. This dog was good, each bite was fresh and no soggy bun here!   I'd come back and try again, it's simple, fresh, and fast.",

I asked one of the staff if I need to stand in line. I told him that I ordered my food ahead and picking it up. He rudely said \"you have to stand in line\". so I did, When I got to the cashier it was already 12:25 and told the cashier, I came to pick up my order. She said with a grin on her face that they have to cook the French fries. I said to her \"I thought if you order ahead it will be faster\". She said if they cook the French Fries ahead it will be soggy. So I waited some more, finally they called out my name at 12:30. I told one of the staff who handed my food that it doesn't make a difference if I called ahead or not, I still have to wait 15 minutes, more insulting grin from her. I love Chicago Vienna dog but if the service is bad, I am not going back there if I can help it. :(",

Ordered the #1, Windy City's Chicago Style Hot Dog & Fries.  Portion was a little small, but I guess that is why they have a #2, which is the same thing but with two dogs lol.  I really liked the pepper and the toppings on the hotdog, but I would be lying if it was my favorite dog in town.  Since I have never had a real Chicago dog, I don't care if it is authentic or not....but the dogs were somewhat small, and not very snappy to me.  But still a solid hotdog!  Also did the #10, Windy City's Chicago Style Italian Beef Sandwich.  We ordered it wet, and it was definitely good, just wished there was something more in there besides meat and bread.  Needs some sort of pepper or veggie for consistency and taste IMO.  My friend ordered the sausage and peppers, and it looked a lot better tasting to me.  I think my tab was around $12, so it is decently priced, and if I ordered the right stuff, it is good bang for your buck.  Give it a try!",

We were greeted as we walked in the door by two very friendly and outgoing people behind the counter. The Italian Beef was ordered 'wet' (whole sandwich dipped, bread and all) and with the spicy jardiniere.   We took a seat and waited while everything was made fresh. I loved all of the posters and pictures on the wall showing the Chicago stadiums and teams. Made me feel like I was back in Chicago for a bit. Hubby loved the Italian Beef, and made a great mess of himself while eating it. If the juice is running down your arms, you are eating it properly!  This was definitely a fun place to visit, with super friendly staff and great food. I give it 4.5 stars since it seems a bit pricy. Not too badly though. I was torn between 4 and 5 stars.",

These two places were rated 3 and 1, respectively in the US.  I had high hopes of finding something, close, not expecting perfection.   At the suggestion of the order person, I ordered the House Special, a hot dog accompanied by a beef dip sandwich.  It was served with  french fries.  Though they did prepare the hot dog with Chicago like fixings, it was nowhere in a class with Super Dog. Neither were the fries, just  on par with Mc Donald's.  I can't say anything nice about the beef dip, so I won't say anything.   I went with Brian, my house painter, who is an exact look a like, for the Zig Zag Man.  He never had a genuine Chicago Hot Dog, but he said he'd had better, too.  Service was friendly, and for Las Vegas, this is better than Pink's, and it's probably as good for a hot dog, that you will find in this wasteland of eateries.   Two Stars means \"I've experienced better\", and these folks are not in a class with hot dogs from Chicago.",

He always raves about the food. Since I've had this place bookmarked for a while I thought this would be a great place to get food for him for father's day dinner.   First off we ordered for pickup so I can't comment on the actual dining experience but I can say that the restaurant is small. They have about 10 tables and a small bar that seats about 6. FYI they don't serve alcohol. The walls are all decked out with Chicago shit. Posters and framed newspapers articles, signed memorabilia, etc. I walked in and was greeted by a nice lady who I assume is the owner who told me that they were working on my order and would be ready soon. I sat down and waited about 10 minutes until everything was done. I have to say the owner was very nice she was also really thorough and made sure everything I ordered was in the bags which I appreciate. Hate getting all the way home and realizing something is wrong or worse not in the bag.   When I got home we sat down to eat right away. I immediately noticed the fries were hard and almost cold. I thought they were tasty but would have preferred if they were crispy and hot. I only live about 10 minutes from here so I can't imagine the food went cold in that short amount of time. I think maybe the fries were sitting there while the other food was being prepared.   I ordered the beef sandwich dry with au jus and hot gardinera on the side. My sandwich was exactly how I ordered it.. DRY and not in a good way. The meat was super dry and even dipping it in the au jus didn't help any. The Gardinera tasted homemade but I didn't like it at all. It was missing something and I just can't put my finger on it. I was really disappointed with the sandwich. I would probably order it wet next time if I was to dine in and add cheese and sweet (bell) peppers and hopefully that would make it taste good. We shall see.   I got to sample the reuben which was good but small, a Chicago hot dog that was ok and a polish sausage with hot mustard. The mustard is HOT. I like spicy things but this was really hot it over powered the flavor of the Polish. I might try this place again because I like to support local businesses but I won't go out of my way to go here. I prefer chicago dogs on Rancho wayyyy better then this place.",

Anyway, I ordered the footlong coney on a poppyseed bun w/cheese and an Italian beef sandwich. The coney was smothered in what had to be Hormel can chili(believe me I've had it enough to know) to hide the fact that they used 2 smaller dogs instead of the footlong,sprinkled w/cheese that hangs on the peg at the grocery store instead of shreding their own. I was expecting to eat it like a normal dog but I was denied. Who the hell eats a hotdog w/a knife n fork! The Italian sucked, the beef was sliced so thin it just crumpled into wads. Nothing like their pictures on the wall or what I've seen on tv. Typical decor,tacky Chicago sports memoribilla everywhere,street signs ect... If these city themed eaterie owners love their towns so much,why do they leave them?",

The lady who helped us was very nice; however, we had to wait quite a while before we got our hot dogs.  (I will say that the place was pretty busy while we were there)  Anyway, once the food came out, we thoroughly enjoyed our delicious meals.  The french fries were crispy and abundant, and the hot dogs had that special \"snap\" to 'em.  Great little place to check out if you're down for some Chicago-style hot dogs (or chili dogs!).",

As of late I've been divulging into spicy meals where ever & whenever feasible & its been rather flat out, well that's just about it, flat (or maybe I haven't been going to the right places)  As I chatted away with the friendly lady over the counter about all things chi (yes I'm from chicago) the busy bodies of the place were preparing what would be, my last spicy treat for...oh let's say the next decade.  After a short wait, my meal slid in, coated with sport peppers, spicy mustard & everything else in the kitchen sink! Slid the peppers out of the way & worked my way into the meal.   A quarter of the way through the heat had started building up, near half point it felt like an atomic orgasm had just erupted in my mouth! My palate was having a seizure, sweat gushed out of their glands & the tears could no longer be held back! It was scorching hot! To the point where my tongue started rejecting the food the moment it made contact! I gazed at the lady as she remarks \"you wanted it spicy\" & I return the gesture with the look of defeat. As I take a long pause from the meal to let the heat wear out.  All in all I shall return! For more of the pleasurable punishment! Friendly chi-town staff, neighborly & real. Sorry I couldn't say a proper g-bye, I was sucking up the blood o.O (i kid)",

I got the #1 with fries and a drink and they make the hotdog look just like the picture. The owners are nice people (family owned place) and greet you as you come and go. They also have a calendar of gimmicky offers through each month like \"if you have a 5 in your address you get a free hotdog\". It's neat idea. It's a little pricey for a hotdog combo running about $7.50. I will say though, it tasted just like a chi-town hotdog with the poppy seeds on the bun and everything!",

When I first walked in I noticed not only the many other diners but also the Chicago sports memorabilia on the walls.   I spent several minutes looking at the menu of Chicago themed food choices. I settled on the Italian Beef sangwich dipped. That is to say beef on a roll dipped in sauce. Or \"gravy\" if you want to be correct. It was a huge sandwich and very tasty indeed.  To top off this Chicago outting in Vegas I ordered a Green River Soda. I'm not really sure what to think of Green River. It was almost soap like in taste. I don't think I would order it again. The sandwich I would for sure. Maybe even something different like a classic Chicago Dog. Oh, and the service was good too. A little slow and seemingly unorganized to a small extent.

I am not going to get into exactly what makes a great chicago dog, that is another show, all I will say is that if you don't know it is one of this countries great culinary achievements and they follow the formula to a T.  Their italian beefs are real good too, tasty and tender but I typically get the 2 chicago dog meal that comes with some great fresh cooked delicious fries for like 6 bucks.  Their chili dog is solid too but the chicago dog is better for me.    This atmosphere is great, the only thing that reminds you that you are not in some staple chicago spot that has been around for 30 years is how new and clean the place is, with any luck in a few years it will get more dingy.

    "text": "I had the basic hotdog (I think it's the #1), with various condiments and was unfortunately a bit disappointed.  I was looking forward to finding out what the big deal was about a Vienna hotdog, apparently made famous in Chicago.  Frankly, I couldn't see what all the hype was about.  At $4.50, I thought it was way pricey for what it was.  Not a bad dog, just nothing thrilling.  The dog didn't have much flavor or snap at all.  Buried under a lot of condiments it could have been any type of dog at all, no different or better than the average dog out there.  The bun was somewhat a cut above typical fast food, it had poppy seeds and was okay, but nothing particularly special.     It came with fries, which were good, although a tad salty, but still good with a somewhat different, fuller flavor than  fries I've had elsewhere..  I liked the cute little brown bag they are served in and they never got limp so that's a plus.  But getting back to the hotdog....I liked the neon green relish the best lol....but I didn't go for the relish, I went for the dog.  At $4.50 I won't be trying it again.  I don't know what I was expecting but it didn't send me to the moon or anything.  Darn!  Oh well, maybe other people have a different opinion and to each their own.  But the place is clean, looks well run and I guess is popular for certain sandwiches which run upwards of $6-8 which again is too much for me unless it's amazingly outstanding.   Judging from the hotdog which for me was \"meh\", I'd have to be seriously convinced to make another stop in here.",

We were also hungry and wanted a quick bite to eat.. This is a great place to come if you're hungry and want food asap!   We ordered two corn dogs, a #4- best of both worlds hot dog and 3in beef sandwich, #8 -chicken wings (mild with ranch) & their special for that day - a 16in sausage with fries and a drink.  Everything was pretty good! The fries were not soggy, nor burnt. The chicken wings aren't smothered in sauce, which is appreciated. It gives you the chance to put as much or as little as you want. It's even enjoyed by the little ones because it's not spicy.   We went around 3:30pm and dined in. There were only 2 other parties eating there. However, while we were there, 4 other people came in and did to go orders.",

    "text": "Located in the Von's shopping center on Lake Mead & Buffalo, Windy City Beefs-n-Dogs is run by \"dees guys\" who believe Chicago food is the best in the world. And in an effort to bring some of that flavor to Vegas, they've got a full menu of classic dishes straight from their hometown.  Now, the restaurant itself is a bit on the small side. When you walk in the door, it's basically like looking down a hallway with chairs against the wall. There's also counter style seating to the right that overlooks the cooks working their magic, and a menu hanging over the register where you place your orders. On that menu, you'll not only find those classic Chicago dishes, but other options like burgers, wings, fingers and even gyros. Unlike their Eastern location though, this one does not serve pizza. However, they've just added a new bulk menu that allows you take home everything from pounds of meat, to gallons of ju!    On the just under a handful of times that we've been here, these are the things I've had...  Chicago Dog - A classic, done right! No matter where I go, this is absolutely one of my favorite ways to eat a hot dog, and dees guys now how to do it. They proudly display their use of Vienna beef dogs and top it with all fresh ingredients, including a full pickle spear, the all important tomato wedges and of course, snappy and spicy sport peppers. Plus they put in all a perfectly steamed poppyseed bun, making for one of the better Chicago dogs you'll find in town.  Beef Sandwich - Easily one of, if not the best I've had in Vegas! Tons of thinly sliced tender beef and mozzarella cheese inside, and done up with gravy however you like. I prefer mine wet, giving it a good balance of texture without making it too soggy where it requires a fork & knife. I'm also a huge fan of their spicy Papa's Giardiniera, which gets its heat from habanero and serrano peppers tossed in with diced veggies. If you like a good beef sandwich, this is where to find it!  Pizza Puff - This is definitely my least favorite thing I've tried here. They describe it as a folded up piece of pizza that's deep fried, almost like a glorified hot pocket. While it's okay, I feel like the taste of this could be much improved with higher quality ingredient. But for only a few bucks and served with fries, it's worth ordering just to give it a shot for yourself.   We've also tried a few different items, such as fingers, wings and fries. I wasn't a huge fan of either the wings or fingers, they just have very little to offer, but the fresh cut fries are decent and come plentiful in a brown paper baggy. That's sure to make just about any fry lover smile!  Prices aren't terrible either and I love the way they do mix and match things on the menu. My order is almost always the #4 which comes with both a Chicago dog and smaller 3\" beef sandwich. You get the best of both worlds, and for only about $9, it's more than worth it.  Lastly, this place has excellent service. We've been greeted with smiles every single time, and there's always regulars in that they recognize, giving it in a nice small town feel.   Having never been to Chicago myself, I can't say for sure if this stuff is authentic...but I can tell you that it's excellent! And if this is how they do it in Chicago, book me a flight and get those dogs and beef sandwiches going!",

    "text": "Experience:  I was in between appts in the area, so I thought I'd try something new....looked on YELP and this had great reviews, so here I am!!  Facility:  Small joint with about 10 tables and 10 counter seats. Very clean, quaint fast food style with lots of sports memorabilia on the walls to keep your eyes entertained.   Service:  I approached the lady at the counter who identified herself as Lindsay, and after finding out it was my first time, she immediately went into the description of what they offer and what is popular. She was so friendly and helpful!!!  You can tell she is someone who actually enjoys her job...management give her a raise!  ;)  Food:  together we decided on the #4, which had a Chicago style hot dog and a beef half sandwich, their two most popular choices.  The Chicago style dog was loaded with toppings and delicious. I ordered mine with no onions.   Then the beef sandwich was served \"wet\", which means they dip in it au jus for you. I got this with cheese and Papa's Giardinera hot pepper mix on top. Loved the sandwich and the peppers were just the perfect amount of spicy.  The French fries were some of the best I've had in a long time. They were hot, freshly cooked shoestring fries with a mild seasoning salt. Just amazing! Then to really put my experience over the top, they have a calendar with unique specials everyday.  Guess what today's was??  A free hot dog for anyone whose name begins with \"L\". Score!!!!  So, I got that one plain and Togo for later.   Overall:  just loved this little spot. Although I don't like to give a lot of 5 stars out to fast food...between the service, fries, and the free hot dog, how could I jot?!?! It is kinda outta the way, but since I have appts on this side of town, I will be back again to try something new. You gotta try this spot too!!!!",

Me never have coming here before I was a little nervous at what to order especially since the menu to me at least, looked a little overwhelming. I wasn't sure where to start . However,  luckily the excellent staff here was ready for me. As soon as I informed that I've never been here before they took me down the list of items i informed them of what I was looking for then ordered their hot dog with some grilled onions and a pickle and just for curiosity sake I asked would it be okay to substitute the fries that came in their meal for chili cheese fries they said of course. To my surprise the fries were fresh the chili had great taste and the cheese was real cheese the hot dog in itself was great as well. Hot and juicy on a soft warm bun grilled onions wow. I happen to pass this place a lot and finally decided to come in and wow what a find definitely, definitely 10 + Stars thank you Windy City for being in Las Vegas and rescuing me from my chili cheese famine.",

I'll put them on the side.\"   The end result was that whether I liked them or not, these are all \"extras\" and the final bill was over $10.  I consider this to be a disingenuous \"Chicago hustle\" and will not be returning.  Shame!  But, I only deducted one star for that issue.

    "text": "Chicago-themed eatery with dogs and Italian beef sandwiches, with pizza puffs, gyros, and wings available too. Comparable quality to the Al's Beef on Sahara, which I was at recently. Great combo meals available, combining one or two mains with a side of fries (and the side of fries is enormous).  Italian beef, hot and wet: Better sando than Al's executed. Sandwich was adequately moist, beef was tender and high quality with great flavor, hot pepper sauce also had a kick of garlic to it.   Foot long Vienna Chili Cheese Dog: a bit confused as to why this was two regular dogs on one 12\" bun, but the chili and cheese were both good. Definitely add onions to this. Poppy seed bun is a great little upgrade.  Chicago Style Dog: Not as good as the one I had at Al's, can't put my finger on why. Bun didn't hold up too well, flavors seemed a little muted compared to other versions I've had.  Pizza Puff: Basically a ballpark version of a pizza hot pocket, complete with odd processed flavor but it totally brings back the memories for me. Probably don't ever need to get this but it's a cheap $3.50 add-on to your meal, and big enough to split.  Side of fries was huge and salty, one is enough for two to share and then some. Will come back to try the wings and gyro eventually, so for I've been sticking to their staples. Service is very friendly, takeout orders are well-packed in wax paper and about an entire roll of foil to travel well.",

    "text": "I love me a good Chicago Dog and this place is pretty solid.  Vienna Beef everything, dogs, neon green relish, steamed poppy seed buns.  They have all the right ingredients that's for sure.  I prefer the jumbo vienna beef hot dogs.  They are skinless and a little fatter.  I've always thought the regular Vienna Beef dog, gets a little lost in all the toppings, and that was the case here.  However I swear as I was walking out, I heard them telling a customer about the Jumbo dog.  But I never saw it on the menu - darn it!.  The skin on the regular dog gives it a little snap when you eat it, which doesn't really do much for me either way, but most Chicago Dog aficionados swear by the snap.  While this was a good Chicago dog, it could have used a little more celery salt and the tomatoes could have been a little better.  I did like how their pickle spear was sliced thin enough to actually be eaten along with the dog.  Most places you have to take the pickle off and eat it separately.  3.5 stars for the Chicago dog. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/windy-city-beefs-n-dogs-las-vegas#Z6UGYg-LExpNUYs7Qt2jRA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wind...</a>  The star of the show was the Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich.  They serve it dry, wet, or dipped.  We decided to go wet and it had just the right amount of sogginess to it.  I had them add mozzarella cheese and got the giardinera pepper mix on the side.  They have two levels of spice on the giardinera mix - medium and hot.  We went medium and it had just the right amount of vinegary spice to it.  The Beef itself had a nice peppery flavor to it, and it just melted in your mouth as it's been simmering in it's own au jus.  4.5 stars <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/windy-city-beefs-n-dogs-las-vegas#dMWDeRLDPiRWLo09g5oQAg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wind...</a>  I don't really get the pizza puff.  After reading the yelp reviews, I thought some yelpers were on to something here, so I had to give it a try.  I found it very uninspired.  Like a hot pocket.  It had small pieces of ground sausage, tomato sauce, and mozzarella cheese, in a pastry.  Nothing that you can't get a frozen version of at a grocery store.  2 stars <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/windy-city-beefs-n-dogs-las-vegas#BmSWVAd7apKHf44lPrHtLw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wind...</a>  The fries were just ok for me.  Fried to order and served in it's own little brown bag, they were plenty hot and you could add some salt and shake the bag.  They were pretty thin cut and on the crispy side.  I'm more of a thick steak fry or crinkly fry kind of guy.  I like to taste the potato on the inside of the fry.  So I knew right away that I wasn't really going to be into Windy City's fries.  3 stars.  Service was very friendly and they made us feel at home.  You can tell they really know their local customers and they have a well deserved loyal following.  They also take pride in their restaurant and it was very clean and nicely decorated.  I also like how they randomly write a man and woman's name on a board every day.  If it happens to be your name, then you get a free hot dog.  How fun!  On this day Chester and Diane were the lucky names.  5 stars.",

Spicy Mustard is also available.    Fries were greasy but hot and tasty.  And, even though it was lunchtime, of course I would not leave without first ordering and then downing an entire Italian Beef Sandwich, as well.  This time the impressive sammie was 7-1/2-inches of greatness, featuring beautifully seasoned dipped beef and oodles of zesty Sweet Green Peppers.

    "text": "I enjoyed the Spicy Sausage so much, I went to this place twice in one day. I just had to do it again! There was so much food to choose from, I wanted to taste it all.  When I first went in, I didn't think I was going to appreciate the food. It didn't look like I place I would eat at. The atmosphere was a bit uninviting. The place is really small and was quite packed, which was expected, being that it was lunch time.  I didn't have much time to decide what to eat because a older guy was behind me huffing and puffing because of the wait. I quickly decided on the Spicy Sausage Combo and a pizza puff. It took them about 12 minutes to prepare the food and pass it to me.  I took the food to go, so when I got home (a 10 minute drive) my food was still warm. I unwrapped my Sausage and bit into it. The peppers and grilled onions mixed with the Sausage took me by surprise. It was magnificently and pleasantly spicy and the flavor perfectly blended together to make a hell of a dog! It was damn near perfect!  The chili cheese fries were really good. They remind me of when I was a kid, eating Chili Cheese fries from Krystal's. They were a tad bit Floppy but I had to consider my drive home. But, even with the drive they were still delicious. I will get them again.  The pizza puff, on the other hand, were just decent. I've had better, in Chicago, that is, but never the less, it was refreshing to have a imitation pizza puff so close to home. I probably wouldn't order it again because it was the least favorite amongst the items on the menu. I appreciate that I had something to hold me over until my next trip to the actual Windy City.  My second visit back, I took my friend, a Chicago native. I had hyped her up about the food. I knew she wasn't going to be disappointed. It was around the closing time so the place had cleared out to comfort.  That time I had more time to study the menu being that there was no line. We ordered the Spicy Sausage, again, and the Double Dogs with regular fries that time. We decided to eat it there because there were a lot of open tables.  It took about 10-12 minutes for them to prepare the food. I'll say this, I don't like that they have full conversations over the food. A lot of people spit when they talk and its disturbing to think about the \"what ifs\".  Either way we got our food, said I prayer and dug in. The dogs were not as good as the sausage, but they were satisfactory. They went too quick, that I will mention.  The fries were better with chili and cheese on them. They were just fries, nothing special there.  The sausage was as good as it was before. We loved it.  In all, it was good. I've added this place to my \"I know what to get when I go back\" list.",

You can ask me to repeat myself as many times necessary and I have no problem with doing so but it's very frustrating that I get the literal opposite of what I ordered. I ordered the 16\" polish sausage special with NO onions whatsoever. That was my only request and when I got home I opened two cups containing onions on the side and ZERO peppers of what it was supposed to come with. Also, the 16\" sausage was really one sausage broken in half and shoved tightly into an 8\" bun which is definitely not what I would have ordered had I known I would be getting half the amount of bread. I understand getting a small thing wrong once in a while but the lady asked me to repeat myself even when I was already being loud. This gave me the impression she was hard of hearing and that getting my order right would be a gamble no matter how I placed it. I called to let them know of their mistake but since they have given a rather \"nothing we can do\" approach to the situation, I have decided to leave this review in similar fashion since there was nothing I could do about this meal except report my dissatisfactory experience.",

If you're from Chicago, you probably know about Portillo's which I have been missing the 2 years I've lived in Vegas and decided to hunt down a replacement. The beef / gravy was not quite the same flavor as Portillo's, but was still very good. It was also huge. The fries were skinny American style that were also pretty good, but not the thick crinkle cuts I prefer.  Service was FAST, I was welcomed when I walked in and was even wished a Happy New Year.  All in all, the food was good & the service was great. Recommend!",

    "text": "Moving to Arizona I thought I wouldn't be able to find a good Italian beef but there was Portillo's to get a good beef but since I have moved to Las Vegas it was hard finding a good beef until google suggested Windy City Beefs N Dogs. From the reviews and everything you would of thought you were walking in to Chicago with all the decor from the real windy city. My first impression was WTF is this. The staff was friendly, playful a little to much for them to been on the clock. So I'm looking at the menu and I have to say Vegas will get your money any way they can. I have eaten plenty of many beefs and I have to say this was by far the worse I have ever tasted. Let's start with the price Everything you had to pay for. Hot Peppers was overpriced. They weighted the meat and fries. Not to mention that I ordered a side of cheese which was almost $2.50 not mention it was \"beer flavored\" what every that means. Maybe I wouldn't have had a problem if it was freshly made cheese but it was warmed in the microwave right in front of meat. In Vegas dripped means drenched, and what I mean is they dip it and then add a ladle and a half over the beef. Then there are the fries I can honestly admit that I am a connoisseur when it comes to fries and these fries and Windy City Beefs N Dogs were theeeee worse fries I EVER tasted. People I know keep saying make it was the staff and the way they made your food. Could be but I highly doubt it. But to say the least they get business but I feel like them people picking up orders didn't has any taste buds. I was told that they have been is business for 10 years or so. I really hope Vegas gets a Portillo's while I'm living here if not I don't mind the drive to Arizona. Unless I can find a decent beef in Vegas other than Windy City.....",

And the price is right.   My husband is a big boy who loves to eat so normally when we eat hotdogs he has to order a minimum of two. He doesn't need to do that here but he still will of course; he does love this place more than I do, but that does't mean I don't get down. We get their polish dog, Chicago dog and Chili dog. Oh the simplicity of hot dog love. I like the fries too sometimes, they're tasty. Thus I was won over. Good fries on top of a good dog is a stacker's dream.   I'd say go to Windy City when you're craving a simple Chicago dog. I don't know many places that pay proper mind to the relish dog unless they're trying to be gourmet.

    "text": "Where where where to start with this place.  Ill start with walking in, to a small over crowded restaurant with menu that hangs loomingly over your head making you crink your neck back trying to see the few small options. If someone had been siting at the table near the register we wouldnt have been able to see the menu.  Then upon review of the menu at the \"Authentic chicago hot dog place in vegas\" discvered THEY DONT EVEN HAVE A CHEESE DOG!!!  Once we ordered and paid for over incredibly over priced food. 8.75 for a bun with a scorched hot dog(what my girlfriend got instead of a cheese dog), a small drink and what any restaurant would consider to be smaller than a small amount of unseasoned reheated and mushy french fries served to us in a paper bag like I was in kindergarten going to school with a sack lunch.  I ordered a Italian beef sandwich dry with au jus. When I unwrap this the bun is so damp and wet that it was stuck to the paper monstrosity they wrapped it in. I ended up tearing 1/4 of the bun off as to not eat paper. I take my first bite only to discover more atrocities lie in wait. The \"Italian beef\" is more like dehydrated beef so dry that when I took a piece I couldnt even fold a 1 inch piece without it crumbling apart. the au jus they gave me might as well of been water with some brown food dye in it to make it appear to be au jus.  All in all a pathetic excuse of a restaurant. A news article on the wall from when it opened says that the owners number 1 rule is to not call peoples order out by order number and get to know every customers name. Well they certainly didnt call my order number out but they didn't fulfill the other half either and ask my name instead the eye lid seizuring waitress yelled at me while I was reading with my order.  This is one place I will definitely never recommend as my girlfriend (who is from chicago put it) the only thing on the menu chicago was the all beef hot dogs which were not cooked chicago style but were instead charred on a grill until black and crispy.  If there were a no star rating thats what I would give.  Secondly this is not my first time visiting a yelp restaurant but I was so disappointed in this entire experience I felt compelled to share for the first time on yelp. Dodge this place at all costs.",

The chicago dog had no snap, no kick, no personality to set it apart from a gas station hot dog, unless you want to count the hundreds of poppy seeds that rolled off of the yellow paper that my hot dog was wrapped in. The bun itself was gummy and kept getting stuck in my throat.   I would say to skip this place and go to Chicago Hot Dogs because the hot dogs are much better but they have higher prices and a to go fee that I think is ridiculous.

    "text": "Ah yes - finally found a great hot dog place!  It was so good, I had 3 dogs!  Can't believe I was able to scarf them all down.  I had the #2 with all the fixings - I kept the pickles on the side, sans relish - and it was just too good!  There went my workout (or the next several).  The fries were crispy and not soggy.  My husband and the #4 - the Vienna hot dog and beef sandwich - dipped.  He told me he had never tasted such a good beef sandwich with Au jus.  I tried it, but I'm not a beef sandwich person - it was good, however, again, it's just not my thing.  That's on me, though, not on this place. The service was quick, efficient, and very friendly, with very little waiting time.  It's about 19 miles from where we live - and we will be making this trek often.",

    "text": "Im not from Chicago, nor have I ever been. I've seen plenty of shit on reality television shows to tell me Italian Beef sandwiches are awesome. I've been looking for a good one for awhile. I found my new favorite Italian Beef spot. When you first walk inside Windy City its filled with banners for your favorite Chicago sports team and if the team is playing, then they'll be playing it.  Pretty nice for you Chicago fans. There are plenty of tables to sit at and a bar type seating at the actual kitchen. Good setup if you are going with small group of friends or just popping in by your lonesome.  Service? Fast and helpful. I've been once before and the 3 employees who were working, were also working today, which I assume are the owners. The cashier remembered me from my last trip and responded accordingly. My first time being remembered at an establishment, which tells me 2 things, 1. that was a very nice feeling to have and 2. if they remembered me they probably need more business. (and they deserve it)  What did I order? the #4, Titled Best of Both Worlds. A chicago dog, a 3\" Italian beef and fries. I asked them to chili cheese my fries because last time they were pretty good. Less than ten minutes after I ordered I received my special fat ass order.  How did it Taste? You really cant go wrong with a Chicago Dog. Now again I've never eaten one from the Windy City itself, but this local joint is right up there with what I have had. Vienna beef dogs are fantastic and so are their poppy seed buns. The Italian beef, as I really have no Chi Town reference was tender and juicy. You can order it dry, wet or dipped in their homemade au jus. I ordered wet. If you go then you have to at least get it wet. ;) They will also offer you either peppers, cheese or giardinera for it. I, of course ordered Giardinera. If you've never put giardinera on any of your food, you're really missing out. Did I spell giardinera wrong? who the fuck cares because its delicious. The bread with au jus, the juicy beef, and the giardinera adds up to juicy, melt in my mouth good time.  Price?  So a #4 which includes a Chicago Dog and a 3\" Italian beef, upgrade to chili cheese fries, an extra side of giardnera and a diet coke comes to under $13. Trust me you can fill up for under $10, I just wanted to go over the top.  So my first Yelp review and it was long, but I wanted to write it because I want you to go to WIndy City! Enjoy!",

I've never been to Chicago but if their cooking is suppose to be Chicago style then that doesn't say much because the food was not seasoned.  I had the beef hot dog combo and sandwhich.  The beef sandwhich was flavorless and tasteless.  I knew I wouldn't like it after seeing the meat, it was a pale color like it wasn't cooked.  I guess they boil it, it was just so bland.  I had to put it in the oven and add hella seasoning to it.  I got the au jus or  whatever it's called on the side but it was also bland, just tasted like oil and made my bread soggy.  The hot dog was also a pale white color, I guess I'm just not use to that cooking style.  The fries were good though and the service was great.  I guess I'll stick with philly cheesesteaks.",

You just need that Blago fix that the local news outlets just can't match.  I usually eat here at least 3 or 4 times a month. The #4 is a great way to taste the beef and the hot dogs.

    "text": "Every great restaurant must have a few key components. The most obvious and most important characteristic of a great restaurant is great food. Great food does not have to be fancy or unique. Sometimes, the most ordinary food can become great simply by perfecting the recipe.   The food at Windy City Beef and Dogs on West Lake Mead is great. Windy City specializes in Chicago style hot dogs. They are terrific and definitely worthy of a whole restaurant dedicated to them. But, if you dig a little deeper into their menu, you will find beef sandwiches, Reubens and the best cheeseburger in all of Las Vegas. While all their food is delicious, their cheeseburger will leave you excited for the next trip to Windy City.  The cheeseburger is hot, juicy and perfectly seasoned. It is described on the menu as \"A Mouth Watering 100% All Beef Patty with Lettuce, Onions, Tomato & Pickles. Special Sauce Served on Sesame Seed Bun.\" All of these ingredients meld together to make the perfect cheeseburger. Each bite is a testament to the very invention of the cheeseburger. You will never be satisfied by another one again.  Windy City also has many different kinds of specials. They have a calendar with a daily special. One of them is if you check into Facebook from the restaurant, you get a free bag of chips. There is also a board next to the front of the line that contains a couple of first names. If your name is on the board, and you can prove it is yours with identification, you get a free Chicago style hot dog. It is quite a bit of fun to check that board for your name.   The third thing that makes Windy City really great is that it is family owned. In a day and age where mom and pop enterprises are no match for big box stores and chain restaurants, it is refreshing to find a family owned restaurant with good, honest food and decent prices.    Family owned restaurants are more customer friendly and the family that runs this restaurant are no exception. They are obviously happy to have their customers and treat them well. The cashier is always very friendly and so are the cooks. You can even sit at the bar and talk to them.  So, the next time you are looking for a place to eat, bring your family down to meet the family at Windy City on West Lake Mead. Maybe your name will be on the board there and you can have a free hot dog in addition to your cheeseburger. If that isn't enough food for you, you can always order the double cheeseburger.   Whatever you order, whether it be the dipped beef sandwich or the pizza puff, you will not be disappointed and you will probably have found your new standard dinner out.  As one customer on Yelp said, \"Will I return? This place has won my clogged artery Heart....you bet I will!\"",
